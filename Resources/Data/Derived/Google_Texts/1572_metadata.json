Todd Young, a republican from Indiana, and the Forty Hours Is Full Time Act, sponsored by Rep. Daniel Lipinski, a democrat from Illinois, and a few others in the Senate.\n\nThe new federal health care law requires employers with 50 workers or more to provide health insurance to workers logging 30 or more hours per week \u2014 or pay financial penalties to the government. Although the mandate was initially set to begin next year, the White House postponed implementation by a year, giving employers more time to prepare.\n\n\u201cThis is about taking part-time workers who were at 32 hours, 34 hours per week and limiting their work,\u201d Scott DeFife, executive vice president for policy and government affairs at the National Restaurant Association, told reporters. \u201cYou still have to cover the shifts,\u201d DeFife said, predicting that business owners would limit employee hours in favor of hiring other part-timers. However, \u201cthere\u2019s an additional cost for each worker you bring on,\u201d he added, meaning that owners would get squeezed either way, only less so by limiting worker hours.\n\nAlso supporting a redefinition of a full-time worker for the purpose of health insurance are the Retail Leaders Industry Association and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.\n\nYet, International Franchise Association members say they\u2019re not supporting the movement to defund Obamacare, but merely wish to tweak the law to allow for greater flexibility in hiring part-time help. \u201cWe didn\u2019t support the bill, but the bill became law,\u201d Caldeira told reporters. \u201cSo our job now is to mitigate the most costly, burdensome and onerous aspects of the law for our members.\u201d\n\nKevin Maher, senior vice president of governmental affairs for the American Hotel & Lodging Association, likewise attempted a bipartisan appeal to congressmen. \u201cWe want to let democrats know that we don\u2019t want to repeal ObamaCare,\u201d he said on Monday. \u201cWe want to let republicans know that this is the law, and we need to make it workable for business.\u201d\n\nThe trade groups say they believe the year-long postponement of the law\u2019s provision should give them enough time to lobby for change.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "affordable care act, obamacare, definition of full-time worker, health insurance for part time workers", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Franchise restaurant owners lobbied Washington congressmen on Monday to redefine a full-time employee under the Affordable Care Act of 2010.", "title": "Franchise Restaurants Lobby To Change Obamacare's Mandate For Employer-Sponsored Health Care", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/mcdonalds-and-other-franchise-restaurants-lobby-change-obamacares-mandate-employer-sponsored-health", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/17/service-industry-group-lobbies-against-health-care-requirment.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Franchise restaurant owners lobbied Washington congressmen on Monday to redefine a full-time employee under the Affordable Care Act of 2010.", "title": "Franchise Restaurants Lobby To Change Obamacare's Mandate For Employer-Sponsored Health Care", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/mcdonalds-and-other-franchise-restaurants-lobby-change-obamacares-mandate-employer-sponsored-health", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/17/service-industry-group-lobbies-against-health-care-requirment.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/17/service-industry-group-lobbies-against-health-care-requirment.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Policy/Biz", "published_time": "2013-09-17T15:20:38-04:00", "modified_time": "2013-09-17T15:33:53-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Franchise restaurant owners lobbied Washington congressmen on Monday to redefine a full-time employee under the Affordable Care Act of 2010."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe025c\"", "article_summary": "\u201cEmployees won\u2019t have the hours they need, and they won\u2019t get employer-sponsored healthcare, either,\u201d Steve Caldeira, president and CEO of the International Franchise Association (IFA), told The Hill.\nHowever, \u201cthere\u2019s an additional cost for each worker you bring on,\u201d he added, meaning that owners would get squeezed either way, only less so by limiting worker hours.\nThe new federal health care law requires employers with 50 workers or more to provide health insurance to workers logging 30 or more hours per week \u2014 or pay financial penalties to the government.\nYet, International Franchise Association members say they\u2019re not supporting the movement to defund Obamacare, but merely wish to tweak the law to allow for greater flexibility in hiring part-time help.\nA few hundred franchise restaurant owners swept Capitol Hill on Monday to lobby congressmen to redefine the meaning of \u201cMcJob,\u201d arguing that full-time status requiring health care benefits should be raised from 30 hours per week to 40."}
