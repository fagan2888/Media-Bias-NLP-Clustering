Any burden on the woman outweighs the value of the child. Giubilini and Minerva note that philosophers such as Peter Singer have presented arguments for neonaticide for many years. Until now, these arguments have focused on what\u2019s best for the baby\u2014in the words of recent Dutch guidelines, \u201cinfants with a hopeless prognosis who experience what parents and medical experts deem to be unbearable suffering.\u201d Giubilini and Minerva merely push this idea one step further, calling their proposal \u201c\u2018after-birth abortion\u2019 rather than \u2018euthanasia\u2019 because the best interest of the one who dies is not necessarily the primary criterion for the choice.\u201d\n\n\u201cActual people\u2019s well-being could be threatened by the new (even if healthy) child requiring energy, money and care which the family might happen to be in short supply of,\u201d they observe. Accordingly, \u201cif economical, social or psychological circumstances change such that taking care of the offspring becomes an unbearable burden on someone, then people should be given the chance of not being forced to do something they cannot afford.\u201d An after-birth abortion might be warranted by any \u201cinterests of actual people (parents, family, society) to pursue their own well-being\u201d\u2014including \u201cthe interests of the mother who might suffer psychological distress from giving her child up for adoption.\u201d\n\n4. The value of life depends on choice. Pro-choicers don\u2019t accept the idea that the path from pregnancy to maternity, being natural, must be followed. They argue that the choice is up to the woman. Some assert that the life within her has no moral status until she chooses to give birth to it.\n\nAgain, Giubilini and Minerva simply extend this logic beyond birth. Since the newborn isn\u2019t a person yet, its significance continues to hinge on its mother\u2019s decision. Neonates \u201cmight or might not become particular persons depending on our choice,\u201d the authors argue. Until then, the newborn imposes no obligations on us, \u201cbecause we are not justified in taking it for granted that she will exist as a person in the future. Whether she will exist is exactly what our choice is about.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The American Conservative", "description": "William Saletan reports on two philosophers, writing in the Journal Of Medical Ethics, who make a pro-choice case for infanticide, calling it \"after-birth abort", "title": "Up With <del>Infanticide</del> \u2018After-Birth Abortion\u2019", "url": "http://www.theamericanconservative.com/dreher/up-with-infanticide-after-birth-abortion/", "image": "http://theamericanconservative.com/images/facebook-logo.jpg", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "William Saletan reports on two philosophers, writing in the Journal Of Medical Ethics, who make a pro-choice case for infanticide, calling it \"after-birth abortion.\" Among their reasons:3.
