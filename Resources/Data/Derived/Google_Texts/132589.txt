A good florist would go a long way in improving President Barack Obama’s relationships with the U.S. Congress, according to former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg.

During his stop in Sarasota last week, Bloomberg was anything but shy on sharing his opinions on just what is wrong in Washington, D.C.

And one of those problems, Bloomberg said, is that Obama just has failed to make personal connections with members of Congress. Bloomberg, who endorsed Obama’s re-election in 2012, said he’s told Obama the same thing.

“It’s the president’s job to pull them together,” Bloomberg said during a question-and-answer session at the Sarasota Opera. “There is more that he could do to pull them together.”

Later Bloomberg suggested Obama could have been finding out when members of Congress and their spouses had birthdays, and send them flowers as a token gesture.

Bloomberg said it is all about having a more human touch with members of Congress.

But while he criticized the president for not doing more to build relationships with Congress, he praised Obama for working on health care reform. Bloomberg said the roll out of the Affordable Care Act was “terrible” but said at least Obama’s trying to do something about people who cannot afford health care.

“At least he’s trying,” Bloomberg said.

Later, Bloomberg said Obama’s critics are going to jump on him no matter what he does.

“There is nothing Obama can do that Republicans won’t criticize,” Bloomberg said.
