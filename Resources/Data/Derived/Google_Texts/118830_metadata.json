Such is the case with Staples which, according to the trustworthy new information source Buzzfeed, has cut the hours of some employees to lessen the cost of Obamacare.\n\nWhat is new is that a sitting president (apparently on a throne) cited a specific, successful company and its CEO for doing what they are supposed to do: manage their business while implementing rules forced on them by an ever-more intrusive government.\n\nWith his disastrous Obamacare sputtering, Obama went out of his way to attack and tacitly threaten the CEO of Staples, Ron Sargent, after hearing of his reasoned business decision. Beside disparaging the company, Obama went after its CEO with an irrelevant, class-envy comment: \u201cI haven\u2019t looked at Staples stock lately, or what the compensation of the CEO is, but I suspect they could well afford to treat their workers favorably and give them some basic financial security.\u201d Our Dear Leader went on to say, \u201cShame on them.\u201d\n\nWhat does the CEO\u2019s salary have to do with Obamacare? It was tantamount to a Mafia loan enforcer asking you where you live and what route your kids take to school. It was a creepy statement from our president.\n\nObama\u2019s thinly veiled threat to the CEO of Staples is the way his Chicago-style political groups go about their business. It is pure class envy, putting a bull\u2019s-eye on this guy\u2019s back and on his company.\n\nTo his credit, Sargent did what few business leaders do when singled out: He defended himself. He spoke the truth when he said Obama \u201cdoes not have his facts right.\u201d\n\nIf we have learned anything from the Obama administration\u2019s targeting of political opponents by the IRS and Attorney General Eric Holder\u2019s selective prosecutions, it is that we live in a new, extremist state where one does not take the Prophet Obama\u2019s name in vain.\n\nObama is known for spanking any detractors. At least in \u201cFifty Shades of Grey\u201d the heroine had a safe word. One would think a CEO\u2019s safe word could at least be the Constitution.\n\nStaples makes about 2 1/2 percent profit on its sales of office supplies. Obama\u2019s government takes 35 percent of the company\u2019s pretax profits, and sales taxes are about 8 percent. So, Staples made $620 million profit and generated taxes of at least $2.2 billion. The government took 3.5 times more in taxes than what Staples was allowed to keep. As is the case with most businesses, government takes more from their operations than they make for themselves. And Staples is greedy?\n\nAn Obamacare refresher: It only works if you don\u2019t. It is a Big Government transfer of wealth from hardworking, productive Americans to those who do not want to work but who will vote for Democrats. We pay higher deductibles and more for mandated health care that the government decides we need, so Obama\u2019s voting base gets theirs subsidized. Women have to pay for prostate exams and men for gynecological exams. The only person Obamacare will benefit might be Bruce Jenner.\n\nBorn of lies (\u201cYou can keep your health care plan and your doctor if you like, period.\u201d and \u201cIt will decrease annual family premiums by $2,500.\u201d) and then passed through Congress by bribing Democratic senators, Obamacare is a mess. Obama\u2019s lies might be a crime punishable by two to four years as the NBC News anchor.\n\nAfter a disastrous start, Obamacare limps along. The website didn\u2019t work, some union buddies were exempted, and the administration said incomes would not be verified. Then they repeatedly extended deadlines and said certain provisions would not be enforced. With all this and his \u201cred line\u201d about chemical weapons in Syria crossed with no retribution, Obama seems like liberal parents who count to three when trying to control their kids. The kids long ago figured out that when their parents get to \u201cthree,\u201d nothing is going to happen, so it doesn\u2019t matter.\n\nThe administration kicks 5 million people off their private insurance plans and forces them to buy Obamacare, then brags that the government has insured 5 million people. It is amazing when you boast about forcing people to sign up by threatening imprisonment if they don\u2019t.\n\nObama continues to double down on his failed legacy item. He encouraged Health and Human Services bureaucrats to push Obamacare, calling it \u201cGod\u2019s work.\u201d It is not unusual for narcissists eventually to refer to themselves in the third person.\n\nMaybe Brian Williams can become Obama\u2019s new press secretary and explain all this; he has been auditioning for that role at \u201cNBC News\u201d for years.\n\nRon Hart, a libertarian syndicated op-ed humorist, award-winning author and TV/radio commentator can be reached at Ron@RonaldHart.com or visit www.RonaldHart.com.", "article_metadata": {"geo.placename": "Santa Ana", "geo.region": "US-CA", "content_section": "commentary", "description": "Opinion: Ron Hart: Obama puts Staples through the shredder | obama, obamacare, staples, government, ceo, company, new, business, ron, administration", "geo.position": "33.745573;-117.867834", "author": "RON HART", "og": {"site_name": "The Orange County Register", "description": "As businesses across America struggle under the tremendous burden of Obamacare, those who voice any objection to its onerous rules risk being singled out by our president.
