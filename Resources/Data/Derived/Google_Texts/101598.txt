The good news is that this isn't Socialism. It just might be National Socialism.

Like ObamaCare, Obama's massive budget proposal has all sorts of horrible things in it, but one of them is more horrible than the rest.

Under Global Health Activities, there's an extra-special appropriation.

"That of the funds appropriated under title III of this Act, not less than $575,000,000 should be made available for family planning/reproductive health, including in areas where population growth threatens biodiversity or endangered species."

It's hard to misread this as anything except promoting birth control/abortion of humans to protect endangered species. And species that aren't even endangered.

This comes after Obama's Interior Secretary caught flak for telling Eskimos who were dying because of a lack of a road that "I’ve listened to your stories, now I have to listen to the animals.”

According to local Aleutian elders, 19 people have died since 1980 as a result of the impossible-to-navigate weather conditions during emergency evacuations. “She stood up in the gymnasium and told those kids, ‘I’ve listened to your stories, now I have to listen to the animals,” Democratic state Rep. Bob Herron told a local television station. “You could have heard a pin drop in that gymnasium.”

Maybe the United States government should start representing human beings instead of sacrificing human life for the sake of the radical environmental agenda.
