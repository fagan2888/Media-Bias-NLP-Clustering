The Mass. Asian American Commission held its health care summit, featuring a presentation on Asian American and Pacific Island health issues by Dr. Howard Koh, at the Boston Foundation on Sept. 10. He was the former U.S. assistant secretary for health nominated in 2009 by President Barack Obama. Koh stepped down in 2014 and is the Harvey V. Fineberg professor of the Practice of Public Health Leadership at the Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health and the Harvard Kennedy School.

Koh reported Asians make up about 6 percent — about 20 million — of the U.S. population based on census data, but are a fast growing group. Most or 74 percent of Asians are foreign-born and reside in coastal areas. According to population projections, by 2045, the majority of Americans will be of minority background.

“The theme is most of our community is foreign-born, making it difficult to negotiate the health care system,” Koh said. “Many of us don’t have the opportunity to speak English as a first language.”

During Koh’s time in Washington, D.C., the Affordable Care Act was passed in 2010. Along with making health insurance affordable, the act improved care and required federal data reporting to include seven categories for Asian Americans and four categories for Pacific Islanders.

Asians are a diverse group from a large region, making it hard to generalize health information. “Now we get better data that’s specific and disaggregated, so we can get counted and included,” Koh said.

Koh discussed cancer, hepatitis and mental health, with some forms disproportionately affecting Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders. Health care providers must offer culturally and linguistically appropriate services to address issues.

“Health is a gift. It’s precious. We have it today, we hope we have it tomorrow,” Koh said. “It’s up to everyone to protect that.”
