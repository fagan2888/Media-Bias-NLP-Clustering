Trade may get a lot of attention this evening, especially as it relates to Michigan, a state that has been hit hard by the decline of American manufacturing.

Mrs. Clinton now opposes the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement but has previously supported other agreements and appeared to praise the TPP while she was serving in the Obama administration. Expect Mr. Sanders to make that an issue tonight.

Mr. Sanders has already criticized her over trade, writing in an op-ed in the Detroit Free Press: “Since I have been in Congress, I’ve helped lead the opposition to these trade agreements. Not only did I vote against them, I stood with workers on picket lines in opposition to them. Meanwhile, Secretary Clinton sided with corporate America and supported almost all of them.”
