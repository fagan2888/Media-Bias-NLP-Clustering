The acquisition, announced on Monday, expands AxelaCare\u2019s reach into the Southeast and follows its recent acquisition of Advanced Care, a home IV therapy company in the New York-New Jersey metro area, according to AxelaCare spokesman Chuck Weber.\n\nWith its most recent acquisition, AxelaCare has 34 intravenous solutions pharmacies nationwide, adding Ambient Healthcare\u2019s 16 pharmacies in Florida, Alabama, Georgia, North Carolina and South Carolina.\n\nHome infusion is the administration of prescription drugs and solutions in the home via intravenous, intraspinal, epidural and subcutaneous therapies. The use of these therapies shortens hospital stays, saves healthcare dollars, and improves recovery, while avoiding costly hospital readmissions, according to AxelaCare.\n\nAs a larger share of the population seeks access to home infusion services, local pharmacies are responding by offering acute infusion services, Weber said.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/news/home-infusion-company-axelacare-health-solutions-buys-ambient-healthcare", "image": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/IV.PNG", "site_name": "Healthcare Finance News", "description": "The company now has 34 intravenous solutions pharmacies nationwide, adding Ambient Healthcare\u2019s 16 pharmacies in Florida, Alabama, Georgia, North Carolina and South Carolina.", "title": "Home infusion company AxelaCare Health Solutions buys Ambient Healthcare"}, "twitter": {"site": "@HC_Finance", "image": {"src": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/IV.PNG"}, "description": "The company now has 34 intravenous solutions pharmacies nationwide, adding Ambient Healthcare\u2019s 16 pharmacies in Florida, Alabama, Georgia, North Carolina and South Carolina.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Home infusion company AxelaCare Health Solutions buys Ambient Healthcare"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "Lenexa, Kansas-based AxelaCare Health Solutions, a national provider of specialty home infusion services, has purchased Florida-based Ambient Healthcare for an undisclosed sum, the companies announced this week.
