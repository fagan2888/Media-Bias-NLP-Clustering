Prior to the actual groundbreaking, officials ranging from Galvin to Gov. Lincoln Chafee \u201917 P\u201914 P\u201917 voiced their excitement about the project to a crowd of more than 200.\n\n\u201cOn a day such as this, I can see why Travel and Leisure (Magazine) named Providence \u2018Favorite City in America,\u2019\u201d Chafee said.\n\nThe current project serves as a capstone for Chafee, whose self-proclaimed mantra during his tenure has been: \u201cInvest in education, infrastructure and workforce development.\u201d Chafee also created the I-195 Redevelopment District Commission in 2011. The resulting relocation of I-195 cleared up land that will be used for the South Street Landing.\n\nThe new nursing education center will be \u201ca thriving center of the meds and eds,\u201d Chafee said, noting that education and health care are two of the biggest labor sectors in the state.\n\nGalvin pointed to federal historic tax credits as helping to finance the revamp and thanked the state\u2019s federal delegation for its support. As a Brown alum, he said he is particularly excited about the University\u2019s involvement in the project.\n\nSen. Jack Reed, D-R.I., said he believes the project will meet the economic demands of a larger labor force in the health care industry.\n\n\u201cWith the Affordable Care Act, there are \u2026 thousands of Rhode Islanders who will have access to care,\u201d Reed said. \u201cWe need the nurses and the health professionals to care for them.\u201d\n\nThe Rhode Island College nursing school \u201chas been on a roll lately,\u201d said President of Rhode Island College Nancy Carriuolo, noting that 91.5 percent of RIC students who took the National Council Licensure Examination for Registered Nurses last year passed and RIC\u2019s average was eight points above the national average.\n\nThe University will occupy half of South Street Landing, Reed said. \u201cThey\u2019ll be a lead tenant in the 264 beds of graduate housing, and will continue to drive a lot of economic development.\u201d\n\nThe University has invested more than $200 million in the Jewelry District, said President Christina Paxson P\u201919, who participated in the ceremonial groundbreaking. The project \u201creally solidifies our presence here, and one that I think will continue to grow,\u201d she said.\n\nOnce completed, the building will house 400 more administrative employees, she added.\n\nConsolidating administrative offices in the Jewelry District will not only free up space for academic priorities on College Hill, but also allow for more collaboration and consolidation within administrative offices, said Russell Carey \u201991 MA\u201906, executive vice president for planning.\n\nThe offices of the Vice President for Research, which are currently located in three different places on College Hill, will move to the new building, Carey said. The Division of Advancement, which has some employees at 110 Elm Street in the Jewelry District and some on College Hill, will also be consolidated in the new building, he added.\n\nFurther decisions about the use of the new offices and the repurposing of current office space on College Hill will be decided over the next two years, before the lease begins in 2016, Carey said.\n\nMany officials highlighted the collaborative nature of the project. Galvin said the ceremony was \u201cgroundbreaking\u201d on several levels, noting that it highlighted the partnership between state and city leadership, the collaboration between the government and a public utility to solve problems and the sharing of a facility by three educational institutions.\n\nThe project \u201creally needed more than one anchor tenant to make it practical and feasible,\u201d Carey said. \u201cWe probably won\u2019t fully realize how valuable that is for years.\u201d\n\nGovernor-elect Gina Raimondo commented on the uniting factor for all stakeholders in the project. \u201cThe one thing that binds you is a deep and enduring commitment to this state,\u201d she said in her speech.\n\n\u201cHere in Providence and here in Rhode Island, we have all of the ingredients to be nothing less than a world-class place to live, to work and to play,\u201d said Mayor-elect Jorge Elorza. \u201cBut in order to do that, we have to think big, we have to be creative and, most importantly, we have to be collaborative.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Brown Daily Herald", "description": "Federal, state and municipal officials gathered with private sector leaders in a ceremony to kick off renovations to the South Street Power Station Monday.", "title": "Federal, state officials break ground on Dynamo project", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://www.browndailyherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/IMG_1556.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-12-15T19:28:18+00:00", "url": "http://www.browndailyherald.com/2014/12/15/federal-state-officials-break-ground-dynamo-project/", "type": "article"}, "article": {"section": "Metro", "tag": "Jewelry District", "published_time": "2014-12-15T19:03:19+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-12-15T19:28:18+00:00"}, "description": "Federal, state and municipal officials gathered with private sector leaders in a ceremony to kick off renovations to the South Street Power Station Monday.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "author": "Emma Jerzyk"}, "article_summary": "Private sector leaders gathered with federal, state and municipal officials in a ceremony Monday to kick off renovations to the Jewelry District\u2019s South Street Power Station, popularly known as the Dynamo House.\nLincoln Chafee \u201917 P\u201914 P\u201917 voiced their excitement about the project to a crowd of more than 200.\n\u201cHere in Providence and here in Rhode Island, we have all of the ingredients to be nothing less than a world-class place to live, to work and to play,\u201d said Mayor-elect Jorge Elorza.\nGalvin pointed to federal historic tax credits as helping to finance the revamp and thanked the state\u2019s federal delegation for its support.\n\u201cThe one thing that binds you is a deep and enduring commitment to this state,\u201d she said in her speech."}
