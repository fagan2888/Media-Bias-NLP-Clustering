Even though Russia has yet to pull back from its aggressive posture in Ukraine, Mr. Obama denied that his policy has been ineffective, saying that his slow and steady course is better than the notion of \u201cshooting first and thinking about it second.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis was said about Mr. Putin, for example, three or four months ago. There was a spate of stories about how he was the chessmaster, and outmaneuvering the West and Mr. Obama and this and that and the other. And right now he\u2019s presiding over the collapse of his currency, a major financial crisis and a huge economic contraction. That doesn\u2019t sound like somebody who has rolled me or the United States of America,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cThere is this knee-jerk sense, I think, on the part of some in the foreign policy establishment that shooting first and thinking about it second projects strength. I disagree with that.\u201d\n\nBut Republican critics say Russia\u2019s economic woes largely are the result of other factors, such as a global decline in oil prices, not U.S. sanctions.\n\nAlso speaking on CNN on Sunday, Sen. John McCain, Arizona Republican, said it\u2019s \u201cbizarre\u201d to think the American sanctions have had any impact of Russia\u2019s actions, as evidenced by the fact Mr. Putin refuses to stop interfering in Ukraine.\n\n\u201cThere has been no relaxation or drawback of Vladimir Putin\u2019s part as a result of this,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "President Obama doesn't believe that he's been \"rolled\" by Vladimir Putin, rejecting the idea that the Russian president has outmaneuvered the U.S. in a geopolitical chess match.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "President Obama doesn\u2019t believe that he\u2019s been \u201crolled\u201d by Vladimir Putin, rejecting the idea that the Russian president has outmaneuvered the U.S. in a geopolitical chess match.", "title": "Obama: Putin hasn\u2019t \u2018rolled me,\u2019 economic sanctions on Russia have worked", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/dec/21/obama-putin-hasnt-rolled-me-economic-sanctions-on-/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/12/21/gray-obama.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/12/21/gray-obama.jpg", "description": "President Obama doesn't believe that he's been \"rolled\" by Vladimir Putin, rejecting the idea that the Russian president has outmaneuvered the U.S. in a geopolitical chess match.", "card": "summary", "title": "Obama: Putin hasn\u2019t \u2018rolled me,\u2019 economic sanctions"}, "Author": "Ben Wolfgang", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Politics, Vladimir Putin, Russia, CNN, Ukraine"}, "article_summary": "That doesn\u2019t sound like somebody who has rolled me or the United States of America,\u201d Mr. Obama said.\nPresident Obama doesn\u2019t believe that he\u2019s been \u201crolled\u201d by Vladimir Putin, rejecting the idea that the Russian president has outmaneuvered the U.S. in a geopolitical chess match.\nI disagree with that.\u201dBut Republican critics say Russia\u2019s economic woes largely are the result of other factors, such as a global decline in oil prices, not U.S. sanctions.\nThere was a spate of stories about how he was the chessmaster, and outmaneuvering the West and Mr. Obama and this and that and the other.\nIn an interview with CNN, the president said economic sanctions on Moscow are working, crediting the American-led effort with a downturn in Russia\u2019s economy and the decline of its currency."}
