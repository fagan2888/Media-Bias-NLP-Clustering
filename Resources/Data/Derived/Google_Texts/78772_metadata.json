Patrick Foy told the AP it took five days to complete the raid on the massive grow site. Authorities discovered seven reservoirs and seized almost 14,000 plants, 10 miles of irrigation pipes, and 12,000 pounds of trash.\n\n\u201cThey had every spring, every drop of water dammed up and diverted to the plants,\u201d Foy told the AP, adding that he had never seen a more effective marijuana growing operation.\n\nAuthorities were unable to make any arrests during the raid, as over a dozen people working at the grow site fled once the raid began, Foy said.\n\nOfficials have started cracking down on marijuana growing operations, including state-legal operations in Colorado and Washington, using federal irrigation water or other bodies of water illegally.
