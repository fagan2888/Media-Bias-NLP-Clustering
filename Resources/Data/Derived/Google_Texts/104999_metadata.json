I\u2019m still the same guy, with the same qualifications, that I was yesterday. But Arkansas has forced me to make a ridiculous choice about what to call myself. I have chosen to put the needs of Arkansans above my own right to call myself what I am \u2014 a trained orthodontist,\u201d he said.\n\nBurris also said he will work to get the law changed.", "article_metadata": {"description": "LITTLE ROCK \u2014 A month after a federal appeals court ruled that a Fort Smith orthodontist could proceed with his lawsuit challenging the Arkansas Dental Practice Act, the orthodontist said Friday he is dropping the suit \u2014 and relinquishing his orthodontic license.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "John Lyon Arkansas News Bureau &#8226; jlyon@arkansasnews.com", "og": {"url": "http://swtimes.com/business/fort-smith-dentist-drops-license-lawsuit-continue-low-cost-cleanings", "site_name": "Times Record", "type": "article", "description": "LITTLE ROCK \u2014 A month after a federal appeals court ruled that a Fort Smith orthodontist could proceed with his lawsuit challenging the Arkansas Dental Practice Act, the orthodontist said Friday he is dropping the suit \u2014 and relinquishing his orthodontic license.", "title": "Fort Smith Dentist Drops License, Lawsuit To Continue Low-Cost Cleanings"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://swtimes.com/business/fort-smith-dentist-drops-license-lawsuit-continue-low-cost-cleanings", "title": "Fort Smith Dentist Drops License, Lawsuit To Continue Low-Cost Cleanings", "description": "LITTLE ROCK \u2014 A month after a federal appeals court ruled that a Fort Smith orthodontist could proceed with his lawsuit challenging the Arkansas Dental Practice Act, the orthodontist said Friday he is dropping the suit \u2014 and relinquishing his orthodontic license.", "creator": "@timesrecord"}, "al": {"web": {"should_fallback": "true"}, "android": {"url": "swtimes://?eid=2168867", "app_name": "swtimes", "package": "com.stephensmedia.timesrecord"}, "ios": {"url": "swtimes://?eid=2168867", "app_store_id": 964468128, "app_name": "swtimes"}}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=964468128", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.stephensmedia.timesrecord", "keywords": "Business,News,", "article": {"published_time": "2016-01-09T04:07:16-06:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=0.9"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe094a\"", "article_summary": "Dr. Ben Burris filed the suit in May 2014, with another orthodontist who is now deceased, alleging that the law violated his rights under the U.S. Constitution.\nLITTLE ROCK \u2014 A month after a federal appeals court ruled that a Fort Smith orthodontist could proceed with his lawsuit challenging the Arkansas Dental Practice Act, the orthodontist said Friday he is dropping the suit \u2014 and relinquishing his orthodontic license.\nIn a statement issued Friday by the Institute for Justice, which represented Burris in the suit, Burris said he was ending the lawsuit and relinquishing his orthodontic license so that he would no longer be limited to practicing orthodontics.\nI have chosen to put the needs of Arkansans above my own right to call myself what I am \u2014 a trained orthodontist,\u201d he said.\nBurris also said he will work to get the law changed."}
