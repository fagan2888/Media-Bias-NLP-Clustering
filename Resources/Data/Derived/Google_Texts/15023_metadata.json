(AP) \u2014 Nearly a year since a historic wildfire charred a huge swath of California\u2019s High Sierra, debate rages over what to do with millions of dead trees left in its wake: truck them to lumber mills or let nature to take its course?\n\nOne side argues that the blackened dead trees and new growth beneath them already sprouting to life create vital habitat for dwindling birds such as spotted owls and black-backed woodpeckers. Others say time is running out on a golden opportunity to salvage timber to pay for replanting and restoring the forest.\n\nIt\u2019s a classic standoff between environmentalists and supporters of the timber industry, which contends dead trees and brush pose a new fire hazard.\n\nThe U.S. Forest Service is expected to unveil its final decision in the coming weeks on how much of the land burned by the wildfire, known as the Rim Fire, can be logged.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not always possible to please everybody,\u201d said Robert Bonnie, the U.S. Department of Food and Agriculture\u2019s Undersecretary for Natural Resources and Environment. He oversees the Forest Service.\n\nBonnie declined to say how many trees the Forest Service will allow loggers to haul away in the plan being drafted, but he said the goal is to balance the forest\u2019s health with the needs of the local community. \u201cWe try and do our best with the science we have,\u201d he said.\n\nThe blaze ignited on Aug. 17, 2013, when a hunter lost control of his campfire. For two months, flames raced across 400 square miles of the Stanislaus National Forest, Yosemite National Park\u2019s backcountry and private timber land. It ranks as California\u2019s third-largest wildfire and the largest in the Sierra Nevada\u2019s recorded history.\n\nLoggers have already begun removing a small portion of dead trees along roads so motorists aren\u2019t hurt by falling timber. A much more aggressive logging project is under consideration, targeting nearly 50 square miles of forest land.\n\nEnvironmentalists said they are alarmed by the prospect of logging.\n\n\u201cFor us, post-fire logging is the last and worst thing you should ever do in a forest,\u201d said Chad Hanson, a forest ecologist and founder of the John Muir Project, an environmentalist group. \u201cThe scientific community is so strongly against this.\u201d\n\nIntense fires create snag forests that are three times as rare as living, old-growth forests, he said. Wood-boring beetles lay eggs in the dead trees, spawning larvae that become food for the woodpeckers. Flowering plants and shrubs sprouting on the forest floor attract small, flying insects for bats and other animals that the spotted owl swoops in to eat, Hanson said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Replant after wildfire or let nature take over?", "author": "Scott Smith", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Replant after wildfire or let nature take over?", "title": "Replant after wildfire or let nature take over?", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/08/04/replant_after_wildfire_or_let_nature_take_over/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/08/aptopix-rim-fire-recovery.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Replant after wildfire or let nature take over?", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/08/aptopix-rim-fire-recovery.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "title": "Replant after wildfire or let nature take over?", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Replant after wildfire or let nature take over?", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd89ea\"", "article_summary": "Loggers have already begun removing a small portion of dead trees along roads so motorists aren\u2019t hurt by falling timber.\nIt\u2019s a classic standoff between environmentalists and supporters of the timber industry, which contends dead trees and brush pose a new fire hazard.\nWood-boring beetles lay eggs in the dead trees, spawning larvae that become food for the woodpeckers.\nTopics: From the Wires, NewsGROVELAND, Calif.
