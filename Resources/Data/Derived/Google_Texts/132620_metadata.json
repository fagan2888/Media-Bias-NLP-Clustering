(Jay Janner/Austin American-Statesman via Associated Press)\n\nA series of legal setbacks have halted the government\u2019s intensive preparations to move forward with President Obama\u2019s executive actions shielding millions of illegal immigrants from deportation, even as community organizations continue a rapid push to get ready for the programs, according to U.S. officials and immigrant advocacy groups.\n\nSince a federal judge first blocked the new programs in February, the Department of Homeland Security has suspended plans to hire up to 3,100 new employees, most of whom would be housed in an 11-story building the government has leased for $7.8 million a year in Arlington, Va. That building, in the Crystal City area, is now sitting mostly unused, DHS employees say.\n\nYet inside and outside the Beltway, community groups are mobilizing, educating immigrants and training volunteers to help them apply for relief, even though it remains unclear whether the program will ever begin. Most recently, a foundation headed by billionaire George Soros, undaunted by the court rulings, pledged at least $8 million to that effort.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re full speed ahead,\u201d said Josh Hoyt, executive director of the Chicago-based National Partnership for New Americans, a coalition of pro-immigrant groups that have held more than 700 information sessions on the new programs and trained more than 2,000 volunteers to aid immigrants in applying for them.\n\nObama announced in November that up to 5 million illegal immigrants would be eligible to be shielded from deportation \u2014 including undocumented parents of U.S. citizens and legal permanent residents \u2014 as long as they met certain criteria. One of the signature initiatives of his presidency, the plan also expands a 2012 program that has deferred the deportations of more than 600,000 immigrants brought to the United States illegally as children and has granted most of them work permits.\n\nPresident Obama says the White House is being \"aggressive\" to repeal a district court's ruling against his executive action on immigration reform, but is suspending plans to implement the program in the meantime. (WhiteHouse.gov)\n\nBut after Texas and 25 other states sued the administration, calling the moves unconstitutional, a federal judge in Texas in February put them on hold until the case is resolved. A federal appeals court recently upheld that injunction, with legal observers now saying the court fight could last until late in Obama\u2019s term. The 2012 program remains unaffected.\n\nThe legal battle highlights the explosive nature of the immigration debate, which has emerged as an early issue in the 2016 presidential race even as immigration legislation remains stalled in Congress. The fate of Obama\u2019s executive action benefiting immigrant parents, known as Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents, or DAPA, will resonate into the next administration. Most Republican presidential candidates have pledged to overturn Obama\u2019s immigration actions, while leading Democratic candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton has strongly endorsed them.\n\nAs soon as Obama took his actions on Nov. 20, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services \u201cimmediately began efforts to implement those initiatives,\u2019\u2019 said Marsha Catron, a DHS spokeswoman. The next day, the agency leased a 280,000-square-foot building on Crystal Drive in Crystal City to house DAPA employees, according to DHS documents sent to Congress.\n\nThe building came fully furnished but required about $26 million in start-up costs, including $2.7 million for workstation and desktop equipment, documents show. Those costs were to be funded with fees collected from immigrants who had applied for other government programs, and DHS says DAPA would have no impact on any existing programs.\n\nCitizenship and Immigration Services, which is part of DHS, is central to managing the nation\u2019s immigration system and processes more than 6 million citizenship and other applications and petitions each year.\n\nThe plan also called for 1,000 employees, mostly new hires, to start up DAPA in Crystal City and 400 staffers at other service centers nationwide to process applications for the expanded 2012 program for immigrants brought illegally to the United States as children. That program is known as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA.\n\nOver time, however, Citizenship and Immigration Services projected that a total of 3,100 new employees might be needed for the two programs, which were expected to cost up to $484 million per year and be paid for by the $465 application fees required for each applicant.\n\nBy mid-February, DHS was days away from beginning to accept applications for the expanded DACA program, with the first DAPA applications to follow in May.\n\nBut on Feb. 16, U.S. District Judge Andrew Hanen in Texas issued his ruling temporarily blocking both. Citizenship and Immigration Services \u201cimmediately took steps to ensure the agency ceased its preparations,\u2019\u2019 said Catron, who added that DHS is \u201cdisappointed\u201d by that decision as well as the May 26 one by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit upholding it.\n\nSince then, \u201ceverything is on hold,\u201d said Kenneth Palinkas, president of National Citizenship and Immigration Services Council 119, which represents about 12,000 Citizenship and Immigration Services employees. Current employees who had been offered jobs in Crystal City have had the offers put on hold or rescinded, he said.\n\nAs for the Crystal City building, only the first floor is being used to train employees, about 30 at a time, on various aspects of immigration law, said Palinkas, who recently toured the facility.\n\nFederal contractors, some of whom were also slated to work in Crystal City, have also been affected. DHS has canceled a request for proposals for a new mail and file room operations center to be staffed by about 400 contractors, documents said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of come to a screeching halt,\u2019\u2019 said Marielena Hincapie, executive director of the National Immigration Law Center, which helps immigrants with legal and other issues. She said the Obama administration \u201cis being very cautious. . . . They feel that injunction was very clear, that they\u2019re not able to do anything.\u201d\n\nBut immigrant advocacy groups feel differently, she said, because activists are confident that the administration will eventually prevail in the courts. \u201cThere is a sense of being undeterred, that we are going to continue planning,\u201d she said. \u201cWe need to make sure that the infrastructure is in place and ready to go.\u2019\u2019\n\nAcross the nation, immigration advocacy organizations and other community groups are training people who will act as \u201cnavigators\u201d \u2014 helping immigrants determine whether they are eligible for DAPA , locate key documents such as school transcripts and fill out the application. Activists describe the training as similar to that for another key Obama initiative, the Affordable Care Act, which also used navigators to help people enroll for health insurance.\n\n\u201cThe reality is you can\u2019t turn on a switch in people\u2019s lives and all of the sudden 5 million people pour into the gates of DHS and move into the application process,\u2019\u2019 said Ken Zimmerman, director of U.S. programs for the Open Society Foundations, of which Soros is founder and chairman.\n\nZimmerman said the $8 million the organization is making available will go to a variety of community groups and will fund things such as new computer software to help them process applications. He said the foundations may donate more.\n\nIn the Washington area, CASA \u2014 a Maryland-based immigrant advocacy group \u2014 is continuing the DAPA informational sessions it has been holding in Maryland, Virginia, Pennsylvania and Delaware since Obama\u2019s announcement in November.\n\nAt first, \u201chundreds and hundreds upon hundreds\u201d of people showed up, said George Escobar, CASA\u2019s senior director of human services. Since then, he said, \u201cobviously interest has waned a little\u201d amid frustration over the legal setbacks.\n\n\u201cOur job is to keep people motivated,\u201d added Escobar, who believes it is \u201chighly likely\u201d that DAPA will survive the court challenge. \u201cWe will continue to prepare for it,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Even as activists gear up, court rulings have prevented officials from moving forward on a plan to shield millions of illegal immigrants from deportation.", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Even as activists gear up, court rulings have prevented officials from moving forward on a plan to shield millions of illegal immigrants from deportation.", "title": "Obama administration stops work on immigrant program", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/obama-administration-ceases-preparation-for-immigration-program/2015/06/07/12a142e6-0ba4-11e5-95fd-d580f1c5d44e_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2015/06/07/National-Politics/Images/Immigration_Rallies-08aea-4327.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@JerryMarkon"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/obama-administration-ceases-preparation-for-immigration-program/2015/06/07/12a142e6-0ba4-11e5-95fd-d580f1c5d44e_story.html", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "eomportal-uuid": "12a142e6-0ba4-11e5-95fd-d580f1c5d44e"}, "article_summary": "Since then, \u201ceverything is on hold,\u201d said Kenneth Palinkas, president of National Citizenship and Immigration Services Council 119, which represents about 12,000 Citizenship and Immigration Services employees.\nCitizenship and Immigration Services \u201cimmediately began efforts to implement those initiatives,\u2019\u2019 said Marsha Catron, a DHS spokeswoman.\nThe next day, the agency leased a 280,000-square-foot building on Crystal Drive in Crystal City to house DAPA employees, according to DHS documents sent to Congress.\nFederal contractors, some of whom were also slated to work in Crystal City, have also been affected.\nAt first, \u201chundreds and hundreds upon hundreds\u201d of people showed up, said George Escobar, CASA\u2019s senior director of human services."}
