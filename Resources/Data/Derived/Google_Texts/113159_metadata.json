She asked the usual questions: How old was he when he died, when did he start to use, would Naloxone have saved his life. And then she asked a question no one had ever asked before. What is it like to lose a child to overdose?\n\nI thought for a minute. On the surface, losing a child to overdose is no different than losing a child to disease, violence or an accident. I don\u2019t think the loss itself is any more or less painful. The level of grief over losing a child is only linked to the immeasurable love you had for them in life.\n\nWhen you lose a child, nothing is ever the same again. Parents are not supposed to outlive their children. Every facet of your life has a memory of your child. Every room in the house, every trip in the car, a song, a picture, a book, a walk in the park. There is a hole in your heart that will never be filled. You search and search for answers that just aren\u2019t there. Holidays, birthdays are never the same.\n\nYou dial their phone number to tell them something and then it hits you that the phone is in your purse \u2014 but you still let it ring so that you can hear his voice: \u201cHello, this is Michael. I\u2019m sorry I missed your call but leave a message and I\u2019ll call you back.\u201d You don\u2019t know why you carry it and keep it charged, but it is comforting to know it is there. That message will be the only connection ever to what his voice sounded like.\n\nYou save his clothing unwashed in a plastic bag so that you can open it and still smell his smell lest you forget. You close your eyes, breathe deep and for just a minute he is there with you. You beg, you bargain, you plead to wake up and make it all not true. You find that tears are healing. You walk up the sidewalk from the car to the cemetery and put flowers and balloons and mementos on a plot of grass, because that is the place that has his name on it, the last place you saw the box that held his body.\n\nYou hear and smell and feel things that can\u2019t possibly be there. And you talk \u2014 you talk to the dead. You work on your religion, because you have to believe that there is a better place, another place where angels sing and there is no more pain. Losing a child is a pain like no other. It creeps up on you. You go to the grocery store and as you walk past a box of Cap\u2019n Crunch cereal, tears begin to roll down your cheeks. When you feel so much pain, it seems impossible that people can just pass by with their shopping carts, why they go on with their lives like nothing has happened. You wonder why they can\u2019t tell that someone important is missing.\n\nWhat is different about losing a child to overdose? Losing a child to addiction means you didn\u2019t get to say goodbye, and you have to deal every day with the stigma of being a parent whose child died from drug use (if you are brave enough to be truthful about the cause of death). You question your every decision. You look for what you did wrong, what you didn\u2019t say, why you didn\u2019t have a second sense that something was wrong. You look back over the years, dissecting each part of their life \u2013 looking for clues. And you look at yourself and ask all of the what-ifs. You look for blame but mostly you blame yourself. You find an online group of mothers just like you, where there is no stigma and everyone has the same questions and feels the same pain with no judgment. You force yourself to read the coroner\u2019s and toxicology report hoping there is an answer there. And you cry \u2014 a lot.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The death of my child brought a pain like no other, and made me question every parenting decision I've made", "author": "Diannee Carden Glenn", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The death of my child brought a pain like no other, and made me question every parenting decision I've made", "title": "Losing my son to drugs", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/03/02/losing_my_son_to_drugs/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/03/losing_my_son_to_drugs.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The death of my child brought a pain like no other, and made me question every parenting decision I've made", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/03/losing_my_son_to_drugs.jpg", "title": "Losing my son to drugs", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Losing my son to drugs", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, addiction, Drug Addiction, drug overdose, Editor's Picks, Heroin, Life stories, Motherhood, Naloxone, Parenting, Real Families", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fddd03\"", "article_summary": "On the surface, losing a child to overdose is no different than losing a child to disease, violence or an accident.\nThe level of grief over losing a child is only linked to the immeasurable love you had for them in life.\nWhat is different about losing a child to overdose?\nLosing a child is a pain like no other.\nYou save his clothing unwashed in a plastic bag so that you can open it and still smell his smell lest you forget."}
