In the eyes of activist Larry Ortega, this is unequivocally a positive development. But to call the digital divide closed, even between groups of people who possess the ability to access the Internet, is something he profoundly disagrees with.\n\n\u201fThere\u2019s a misconception that just because someone has Internet access, the digital divide,\u201d the gap between those with Internet access and those without, \u201chas been eliminated,\u201d charges Ortega, who heads a chapter of the digital literacy group One Million New Internet Users.\n\nThe problem, Ortega argues, is that large swaths of the population, groups that are predominantly poor and non-white, are largely relying solely on smartphones for Internet access. It\u2019s created a two-tiered system where the rich have access to expensive, high-speed broadband Internet at home and everyone else is relegated to slower connections on mobile devices that seriously limit users\u2019 ability to contribute to the digital conversation.\n\nOrtega views this emerging digital divide as one between \u201cdigital consumers\u201d on one hand and \u201cdigital contributors\u201d on the other, illustrating the gap with an example from near his home in Southern California. He tells the story of a diverse coalition of groups organizing in favor of ordinances in the cities of El Monte and Pomona that would allow the local governments to use eminent domain to seize underwater mortgages from the banks that hold them. There\u2019s a major grassroots mobilization of local activists to push the ordinances through in the hopes that freeing people in these communities trapped under the crushing weight of the mortgages could jumpstart the region\u2019s moribund economy.\n\nThis activity has occurred through mobile-friendly networks like Facebook and Twitter; however, the original spark that kicked it off\u2014the composition of op-eds in favor of the motion, the creation of YouTube videos explaining exactly what eminent domain is, and more\u2014could never have happened exclusively on mobile devices.\n\nOrtega charges the real promise of the Internet is allowing people to deeply engage with the world and communities around them. In many cases, due to technological limitations, that\u2019s not happening.\n\n\u201cThe real test is seeing if people\u2019s lives are improving because of Internet access,\u201d says Ortega. \u201fKids can go on their phones and watch music videos on YouTube all day, but is that improving their life outcomes in a meaningful way? No, it\u2019s not. They\u2019re limited to being consumers and not contributors.\u201d\n\nWhile smartphones are growing increasingly versatile with each passing year, the limitations of small keyboard and screen sizes increases the difficulty of many tasks that are relatively simple on a full-size computer.\n\nAs the Media Action Grassroots Network put it,\n\n\u201fA cell phone or mobile device is not a substitute for a laptop or desktop computer. Many everyday Internet needs such as applying for a job, conducting research, registering for classes, or accessing government or social services are difficult or impossible on a mobile device.\u201d\n\nIn a recent study of cellphone use, the Pew Internet & American Life Project found that just over one-third of Internet of cellphone owners users reported to mostly going online using their mobile devices. This group, which Pew labeled \u201ccell mostly Internet users\u201d consists primarily of young adults, non-whites, the less educated and the less affluent.\n\nRates of \u201fcell mostly\u201d users were about twice as high for blacks and Hispanics as they were for whites. The figures broke down on roughly equal lines for households earning less than $30,000 per year versus households with an annual income of over $75,000.\n\nFor rich Americans, smartphones are a luxury. For the poor, they\u2019re increasingly a necessity.\n\nIt isn\u2019t only people with low socioeconomic status who are forced to rely on wireless devices for Internet connections. For those living in remote, rural areas, wired Internet access isn\u2019t an option no matter how much they\u2019re willing to pay. The FCC reports that 19 million Americans are living in communities beyond the reachof cable companies or other broadband providers.\n\nPew Internet Center Director Lee Rainie noted that, while the percentage of respondents who primarily use smartphones to get online is fairly high, the number who reported mobile devices as their only means of Internet access is actually very low. \u201fCell mostly\u201d users aren\u2019t entirely bereft of broadband Internet access\u2014they can often get it at schools, libraries, or community centers\u2014but they more than likely don\u2019t have computers or broadband access at home.", "article_metadata": {"description": "With many predominantly poor Web users relying solely on smartphones, the digital divide has never been greater", "title": "Internet access won\u2019t fix inequality", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "With many predominantly poor Web users relying solely on smartphones, the digital divide has never been greater", "title": "Internet access won\u2019t fix inequality", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2013/11/23/internet_access_wont_fix_inequality_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2012/12/democracy_internet_rect.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "With many predominantly poor Web users relying solely on smartphones, the digital divide has never been greater", "title": "Internet access won\u2019t fix inequality", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2012/12/democracy_internet_rect.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Aaron Sankin", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, digital conversation, digital divide, digital literacy, Inequality, Internet access, smartphones, the daily dot", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb9f6\"", "article_summary": "\u201fThere\u2019s a misconception that just because someone has Internet access, the digital divide,\u201d the gap between those with Internet access and those without, \u201chas been eliminated,\u201d charges Ortega, who heads a chapter of the digital literacy group One Million New Internet Users.\nFor those living in remote, rural areas, wired Internet access isn\u2019t an option no matter how much they\u2019re willing to pay.\nTopics: digital conversation, digital divide, digital literacy, Inequality, Internet access, smartphones, the daily dot, Social News, Technology News, Media News, Life News, Politics NewsThis article originally appeared on The Daily DotIn 2013, more Americans than ever are online.\n\u201cThe real test is seeing if people\u2019s lives are improving because of Internet access,\u201d says Ortega.\nBut to call the digital divide closed, even between groups of people who possess the ability to access the Internet, is something he profoundly disagrees with."}
