Those initial estimates filed with the state may change.\n\nThe health law\u2019s insurance markets offer subsidized private plans, with more than 12 million customers enrolled nationwide. Going into their fourth year, they don\u2019t yet seem to have achieved stability. That\u2019s a contrast with more-established government programs like Medicaid and Medicare Advantage, in which private insurers profitably cover tens of millions of people.\n\nThe health law\u2019s nagging problems seem to center on lower-than-hoped-for enrollment, sicker-than-expected customers, and a balky internal stabilization system that didn\u2019t deliver as advertised and was already scheduled to be pared back next year.\n\nThis year, premiums for a benchmark silver plan rose by a little more than 7 percent on average, according to administration figures. Sharp increases for 2017 would fire up the long-running political debate over the divisive law, which persists despite two Supreme Court decisions upholding Obama\u2019s signature program, and the president\u2019s veto of a Republican repeal bill.\n\nOf the presidential candidates, Hillary Clinton is the only one promising to build on the Affordable Care Act. She\u2019s proposed an aggressive effort to increase enrollment along with measures to reduce consumer costs. The Republican candidates all want to repeal \u201cObamacare.\u201d Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders would incorporate it into a bigger government-run system covering everyone.\n\nThe health law is \u201clikely in for a significant market correction over the next year or two,\u201d said Larry Levitt of the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation. \u201cThere have been a lot of signals from insurers that premiums are headed up.\u201d\n\nStandard & Poor\u2019s health insurance analyst Deep Banerjee said he expects premium hikes to be higher for 2017 than in the more stable market for employer coverage. Insurers are facing higher medical costs from health law customers, and companies priced their initial coverage too low in an attempt to grab new business.\n\n\u201cWhat they are doing now is trying to catch up,\u201d said Banerjee.\n\nThe head of the health insurance industry\u2019s main trade group predicts sharper increases.\n\n\u201cIt is a sustainable market for the long term, but right now it is not stable,\u201d said Marilyn Tavenner of America\u2019s Health Insurance Plans. \u201cFolks will try to price this year to get to stability.\u201d\n\nTavenner came to the industry from the Obama administration, where she oversaw the troubled launch of the insurance markets.\n\nThe administration says talk of premium increases is premature and overblown. Initial requests from insurers will get knocked back in some states, officials say, aided by a rate-review process strengthened under the health law.\n\nMost significantly, the law\u2019s subsidies are designed to shield consumers from rising costs. More than 8 out of 10 customers receive tax credits to help pay their premiums, and that assistance will increase as premiums rise. Many consumers have also shown they\u2019re willing to shop around for lower-priced coverage. Taken together, officials say that means increases that consumers face would be much lower than what insurers request.\n\n\u201cMarketplace consumers would do well to put little stock in initial rate filings,\u201d spokesman Ben Wakana said in a statement. \u201cAverages based on proposed premium changes are not a reliable indicator of what typical consumers will actually pay.\u201d\n\nAlso mitigating the pressure for higher premiums is a one-year moratorium \u2014 for 2017 \u2014 on a health law tax on insurers, part of last year\u2019s federal budget deal.\n\nStill, it\u2019s hard to ignore the litany of insurance industry complaints.\n\nLast month, an analysis of medical claims from the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association concluded that insurers gained a sicker, more expensive patient population as a result of the law. The \u201cBlues\u201d represent the most common brand of insurance.\n\nRecently UnitedHealth, the nation\u2019s biggest insurer, said it will radically pull back from the health law\u2019s markets, citing estimated losses of $650 million this year, on top of $475 million it lost last year.\n\nMany insurers struggled because they didn\u2019t know how much health care their new customers would use. Some patients had been out of the health care system for years and had been holding off getting needed care. Insurers also say they\u2019ve been hurt by customers who signed up outside the regular enrollment period and then used a lot of health care.\n\nInsurers who are more bullish on the program tend to be ones that expanded slowly into the markets and have a lot of experience working with low-income Medicaid recipients.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.", "article_metadata": {"shareaholic": {"site_name": "NewBostonPost", "language": "en-US", "url": "http://newbostonpost.com/2016/04/28/significant-premium-hikes-expected-under-obamacare/", "article_author_name": "Associated Press", "image": "http://newbostonpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Health-Overhaul-Premi_Jank.jpg", "site_id": "ab905d8abdbd23a369259b08e0927728", "shareable_page": "true", "keywords": ".gov, Barack Obama, health care, hikes, increase, insurance, law, Obamacare, pay, premium, too much, why does it cost so much"}, "description": "Expect insurers to seek significant premium increases under President Barack Obama's health care law, in a wave of state-level requests", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"image": "http://newbostonpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Health-Overhaul-Premi_Jank.jpg"}, "keywords": "barack obama,obamacare,health care,.gov,law,premium,hikes,pay,increase,too much,why does it cost so much,insurance", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda1cd\"", "article_summary": "Significant premium hikes expected under ObamacarePrinted from: http://newbostonpost.com/2016/04/28/significant-premium-hikes-expected-under-obamacare/The HealthCare.gov website, where people can buy health insurance, is displayed on a laptop screen in Washington.\nThe health law is \u201clikely in for a significant market correction over the next year or two,\u201d said Larry Levitt of the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation.\nThe health law\u2019s insurance markets offer subsidized private plans, with more than 12 million customers enrolled nationwide.\nThe administration says talk of premium increases is premature and overblown.\n\u201cIt is a sustainable market for the long term, but right now it is not stable,\u201d said Marilyn Tavenner of America\u2019s Health Insurance Plans."}
