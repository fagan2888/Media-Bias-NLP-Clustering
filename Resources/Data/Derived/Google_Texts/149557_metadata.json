Larger employers are trying to figure out how to deal with the Affordable Care Act's \"Employer Shared Responsibility Provision,\" which requires applicable large employers to either offer health insurance in 2015, or else pay a tax penalty. The Employer Shared Responsibility Provision goes into effect in 2015 for employers with 100+ employees, and goes into effect in 2016 for employers with 50-99 employees.\n\nBut what large employers should be asking is: how can I take advantage of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) individual insurance premium tax subsidies and actually save money on health care costs?\n\nPlay or Pay Defined\n\nFirst, what does play or pay mean? Play or pay is a concept that requires employers with over 100 FTE employees to provide health insurance to their employees in 2015 (\"play\") or pay a tax or premium toward a publicly provided system that covers people without private insurance (\"pay\"). The ACA play or pay requirement is also referred to as the \"Employer Shared Responsibility Provision\" or \"employer mandate.\"\n\nThe Play or Pay Decision ... and How to Play Differently\n\nMany employers are asking should we play, pay, or play differently with a premium reimbursement program? The decision is not always easy or straightforward. Ultimately, employers want to provide a health benefit that is valuable to employees (i.e. recruitment and retention), and has value to the employer (i.e. the best benefit for the cost).\n\nThere are three choices a larger employer has: to play, to pay, or to play differently with premium reimbursement.\n\nTo play means your company would offer employees health insurance that meets essential health benefits and is affordable to employees, by ACA standards.\n\nTo pay means your company would choose to not offer health insurance and instead pay a tax penalty. Remember, the penalties are being phased in and start in 2015 for employers with 100+ FTE employees, and in 2016 for employers with 50-99 FTE employees.\n\nTo play differently is the middle ground between play and pay. It means your company chooses not to offer a group health insurance plan, pays any applicable penalties, and instead offers employees a health benefits allowance. Employees purchase policies from an insurance agent, online, or through the Health Insurance Marketplaces. Then, the company reimburses employees for their policies, up to the amount of their allowance.\n\nWhy Would an Employer Play Differently?\n\nAn employer would consider playing differently because it will likely:\n\nSave employees and employers a combined 50% on health insurance costs.\n\nAllow employees a full choice of health insurance plans.\n\nProvide employees with better, more flexible health insurance options.\n\nWith the new Individual Health Insurance Marketplaces (guaranteed-issue and affordable because of the insurance premium tax subsidies), premium reimbursement plans now have all the same benefits of a group health insurance plan at a lower cost for the employer and employees.\n\nPremium Reimbursement & Employee Health Insurance Cost Analysis\n\nTo decide whether to play, pay or play differently with a premium reimbursement program, larger employers should conduct a simple cost analysis. Compare the cost (and benefits) of the three options:\n\nQualified, affordable group health insurance Premium reimbursement program + applicable penalties Penalties\n\nFewer than 100 Employees? No Play or Pay Decision in 2015\n\nIf your company has fewer than 100 employees, the mandate and tax penalty (and thus the play or pay decision) does not apply to you. With the new Health Insurance Marketplaces and insurance tax subsidies, many small and medium sized employers are:\n\nDropping their group health insurance plan (if they have one).\n\nAllowing employees to purchase policies through their state Health Insurance Marketplaces and be able to take advantage of individual tax subsidies.\n\nReimburse employees for their premiums (or a portion of their premiums) through the premium reimbursement program.
