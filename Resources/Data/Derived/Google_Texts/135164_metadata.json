Washington\u2019s rushing offense ranked among the best in the league during that time.\n\n\u201cThe last couple of years in Washington, all we did was run the ball,\u201d Montgomery, who is in his ninth NFL season, said after Thursday\u2019s practice. \u201cI do come from a background of running the ball and one of my strong points is run blocking.\u201d\n\nFox verified the Broncos had a paper on Montgomery before taking him out of the free-agent market.\n\n\u201cHe was a player we were familiar with,\u201d Fox said. \u201cWe knew he could get to the second level in the run game, and he\u2019s a good communicator, which is important in the offensive line.\u201d\n\nSince the commitment to add a strong running game in support of quarterback Peyton Manning, the yards have piled up. In a 39-36 victory over the Miami Dolphins, the Broncos rushed for 201 yards, with running back C. J. Anderson accounting for 167.\n\nThe next week against the Kansas City Chiefs, the Broncos rushed for 214 yards, and Anderson galloped for 168 yards in a 29-16 victory.\n\nLast week, the Broncos rushed for 133 yards, with rookie Juwan Thompson gaining 63 yards in a 24-17 win over the Buffalo Bills.\n\nMontgomery was a central part of the changes in the offensive line. When he became the starter at center, Manny Ramirez moved from center to right guard and Louis Vasquez moved from right guard to right tackle.\n\n\u201cThat whole group has done a good job since we made the change,\u201d offensive coordinator Adam Gase said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been solid in protection on the right side, and they\u2019ve been really good in the run game.\u201d\n\nThe offensive linemen have their thoughts.\n\n\u201cWe do what\u2019s asked of us, and we do it at a high level,\u201d Ramirez said. \u201cHe (Montgomery) brings another aspect to the game because he plays the position different than I do. Playing experience makes the run game go easier. We work well together.\u201d\n\nAnderson said Montgomery makes tracks to the linebackers.\n\n\u201cWhen he gets his hands on them, he can move them and I can see where I can get running room,\u201d Anderson said.\n\nMontgomery, at 6-foot-3 and 304 pounds, is an imposing figure. He came to Denver for good reason.\n\n\u201cI thought there would be opportunity to win games here,\u201d Montgomery said. \u201cI thought there would be good opportunity to play at some point, and the opportunity is now.\u201d\n\nIrv Moss: 303-954-1296, imoss@denverpost.com or twitter.com/irvmoss", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Will Montgomery has aided Denver Broncos running game", "title": "Will Montgomery has aided Denver Broncos running game", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/12/12/will-montgomery-has-aided-denver-broncos-running-game/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141212_103841_will-montgomery.jpg", "height": 481}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141212_103841_will-montgomery.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-12-12T20:28:27+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T12:11:05+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde169\"", "article_summary": "Playing experience makes the run game go easier.\nIn a 39-36 victory over the Miami Dolphins, the Broncos rushed for 201 yards, with running back C.
