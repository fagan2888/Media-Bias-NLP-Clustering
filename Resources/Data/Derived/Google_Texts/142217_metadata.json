While the official numbers are a state secret, at the height of Mao's reign, Wu estimates there were \"1,000 labor camps and probably more than 40 million people in the prison camps.\"\n\nAfter Mao died in 1979, the Laogai system was gradually dismantled and most political prisoners, including Wu, were released.\n\nBy 2013, the Chinese government officially turned away from using labor camps as a tactic of \"re-education.\" But last year, a report by the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission expressed \"legitimate doubts\" that China has entirely stopped the practice of sending prisoners to labor camps.\n\nAfter he immigrated to America, Wu opened the Laogai Museum to honor the victims and to spread awareness of the ongoing human rights abuse by the Communist Party of China. Wu is also the founder of the Laogai Research Foundation.\n\nThe Laogai Museum is located in Washington D.C., but Wu hopes someday to relocate it to China.\n\n\"One thing is very, very simple: No one in China believes communism is their future,\" he says. When it will be entirely gone, however, \"we do not know.\"\n\nProduced by Joshua Swain and Robert Mariani.\n\nApproximately 4 minutes.\n\nWatch the video above and scroll down for downloadable versions.
