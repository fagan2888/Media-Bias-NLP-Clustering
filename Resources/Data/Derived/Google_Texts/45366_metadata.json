The Cleaning Services Group\n\nInside the three little walls of an office cubicle many of us can be found quietly typing on our keyboards, staring at our computer screens for eight hours a day. Between the keys, the mouse, and the phone, there are millions of bacteria lurking \u2014 more than the average toilet seat. These private surfaces harbor viruses that cause colds and the flu with thousands of germs per square inch.\n\nIn an effort to dish out the filthy facts about office space and hygiene, The Cleaning Services Group, a national cleaning specialist in the UK, has created an infographic, \u201cHow Clean Is Your Work Space?\u201d The infographic exposes the culprits responsible for harboring thousands of germs that leave behind a minefield of viruses at the office. Contrary to popular belief, 80 percent of infections are transmitted via contaminated surfaces, such as an office desk \u2014 not coughing and sneezing.\n\nIn comparison to office toilets, which contains 49 microbes, or \u201cgerms\u201d per square inch, office telephones harbor over 25,000 germs per square inch, while keyboards and computer mice contain between 1,000 to 3,000 germs. Not washing your hands, eating at your desk, and not sanitizing your desk all contribute to the high volume of germs found at an office desk.\n\nWiping down and practicing good hygiene is vital to prevent the spread of infection. Germs like the common cold can last on computer keyboards and mice for up to 72 hours. More dangerous germs such as Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) can last anywhere between six weeks to seven months.\n\nReduce infection risks dramatically and clean up your desk with more filthy facts about your office desk in the infographic below:", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "office space, office desk, work space, work desk, clean up, hot spot, toilet seat, spread of germs, infections, viruses, cold, flu, mrsa, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Your office desk is more likely to be dirtier than your office toilet seat due to not washing your hands, eating at your desk, and overall poor hygiene.", "title": "Is Your Office Desk Making You Sick?
