Between 2008 and 2014, the amount of money U.S. firms claimed as profits attributable to offshore entities doubled to $2.1 trillion.\n\nRelated: Audit Uncovers $124.7 Billion of Overpayments and Fraud in Medicare and Medicaid\n\nA side effect of the increased avoidance of taxes is that the Treasury Department loses an estimated $90 billion in tax revenue annually, revenue that could be used to reduce taxes domestically.\n\nThe U.S. firm that leads the pack in offshore profits is Apple, and by a large margin. The Cupertino, Calif., electronics manufacturer has an estimated $181 billion in profits booked offshore. Second is General Electric, with $119 billion, and third is Microsoft, with $108 billion.\n\nAccording to the study, Apple paid an effective 2.3 percent in taxes on its overseas billions and would owe the Treasury Department as much as $59.2 billion if that money were not considered overseas for tax purposes.\n\nThe idea that the funds are \u201cconsidered\u201d to be held offshore is important, because much of the money is actually kept in U.S.-based banks and other financial institutions.\n\nRelated: Boomerang CEOs \u2013 10 Top Executives Who Came Back to Rescue Their Companies\n\n\u201cMuch if not most of the profits kept \u2018offshore\u2019 are actually housed in U.S. banks or invested in American assets, but are registered in the name of foreign subsidiaries,\u201d the study notes, echoing the findings of a U.S. Senate investigation. \u201cIn such cases, American corporations benefit from the stability of the U.S. financial system while avoiding paying taxes on their profits that officially remain booked \u2018offshore\u2019 for tax purposes.\u201d\n\nThe study recommends a number of steps that could be taken by Congress to reduce the amount of tax revenue lost to offshore tax havens.\n\nThe simplest solution would be to change the law, which currently allows companies to \u201cdefer\u201d the payment of taxes on overseas income until that money is officially brought back to the United States. The study notes that such a change would bring in an estimate $900 billion in additional tax revenue over ten years.\n\nRelated: Ouch!

Multinational corporations should report their profits on a country-by-country basis so they can\u2019t mislead each nation about the share of their income that was taxed in the other countries.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Nearly three out of four companies in the U.S. Fortune 500 operate at least one subsidiary in an offshore tax haven, and some have registered more than 100 of them, allowing them to evade taxes on hundreds of billions of dollars in profits every year, according to a study conducted by the U.S. Public Interest Research Group and the Citizens for Tax Justice.", "title": "How Fortune 500 Companies Avoid Paying $620 Billion in Taxes", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/10/06/US-Companies-Have-Staggering-Amounts-Cash-Offshore-Tax-Havens", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/12122012_loopholes_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/10/06/US-Companies-Have-Staggering-Amounts-Cash-Offshore-Tax-Havens", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/12122012_loopholes_article.jpg", "creator": "@rrgarver", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Nearly three out of four companies in the U.S. Fortune 500 operate at least one subsidiary in an offshore tax haven, and some have registered more than 100 of them, allowing them to evade taxes on hundreds of billions of dollars in profits every year, according to a study conducted by the U.S. Public Interest Research Group and the Citizens for Tax Justice.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "The U.S. firm that leads the pack in offshore profits is Apple, and by a large margin.\nThe study notes that such a change would bring in an estimate $900 billion in additional tax revenue over ten years.\nBetween 2008 and 2014, the amount of money U.S. firms claimed as profits attributable to offshore entities doubled to $2.1 trillion.\nThe Cupertino, Calif., electronics manufacturer has an estimated $181 billion in profits booked offshore.\n\u201cIn such cases, American corporations benefit from the stability of the U.S. financial system while avoiding paying taxes on their profits that officially remain booked \u2018offshore\u2019 for tax purposes.\u201dThe study recommends a number of steps that could be taken by Congress to reduce the amount of tax revenue lost to offshore tax havens."}
