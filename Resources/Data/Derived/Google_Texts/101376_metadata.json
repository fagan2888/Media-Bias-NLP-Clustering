Mike Pence (R) signed a law on Thursday protecting business owners who decide to discriminate for \u201creligious liberty\u201d reasons. He then defended the practice and suggested he would do it again.\n\nThe business owner, who would not give his name or the name of his business, said he had told some LGBT \u201cpeople\u201d that equipment was broken in his restaurant and he couldn\u2019t serve them even though it wasn\u2019t and other people were already eating at the tables. \u201cSo, yes, I have discriminated,\u201d he told RadioNOW 100.9 hosts. The hosts were surprised the owner said he was okay with discriminating.\n\n\u201cWell, I feel okay with it because it\u2019s my place of business, I pay the rent, I\u2019ve built it with all my money and my doing. It\u2019s my place; I can do whatever I want with it,\u201d he said. \u201cThey can have their lifestyle and do their own thing in their own place or with people that want to be with them.\u201d\n\nThe law has been highly controversial in the state, with many businesses \u2014 including the Indiana Chamber of Commerce and Apple \u2014 saying they were disappointed in the law\u2019s passage and some entities saying they would ban travel or future business in the state thanks to the law\u2019s enactment.\n\nPence himself has tried to defend the law as not a means of discriminating but rather protecting religious freedom, but these claims run counter to text of the legislation, and in fact how this anonymous business owner seems to interpret it. The governor signed the law in a private ceremony on Thursday, and wouldn\u2019t say who attended the signing ceremony.\n\nOther states are considering following Indiana\u2019s lead. A similar bill is currently being debated in Georgia. Nineteen other states, including nearby Kentucky and Illinois, have adopted religious liberty laws.\n\nThese laws try to codify some of what was established when the Supreme Court ruled in the Hobby Lobby case last year, in which a craft store chain objected to covering certain types of birth control for its female employees on religious grounds even though the Affordable Care Act mandated that women must receive birth control coverage without a co-pay as part of its minimum standards of care.\n\nThe Supreme Court later established religious objections could apply to any type of birth control and now states are using this ruling to justify such religious liberty bills that aim to protect owners who refuse to serve people based on their religious beliefs.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "The owner, who wouldn't disclose his name or business, said, \"It's my place; I can do whatever I want with it.\"", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "The owner, who wouldn't disclose his name or business, said, \"It's my place; I can do whatever I want with it.\"", "title": "One Restaurant Already Celebrated \u2018Religious Liberty\u2019 By Turning Away Gays", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/lgbt/2015/03/28/3640221/indiana-business-owner-admits-discriminating-lgbt-people/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/AP478765338611.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The owner, who wouldn't disclose his name or business, said, \"It's my place; I can do whatever I want with it.\"", "title": "One Restaurant Already Celebrated \u2018Religious Liberty\u2019 By Turning Away Gays", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/AP478765338611-321x214.jpg", "creator": "@kaysteiger", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-lgbt", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/AP478765338611.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/AP478765338611.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2015-03-28T09:19:01+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/kaysteigerjournalist"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe02ca\"", "article_summary": "LGBT One Restaurant Already Celebrated \u2018Religious Liberty\u2019 By Turning Away Gays CREDIT: AP Photo/Charles Rex ArbogastAn Indiana business owner went on a local radio station and said that he had discriminated against gay or lesbian couples even before Gov.\nMike Pence (R) signed a law on Thursday protecting business owners who decide to discriminate for \u201creligious liberty\u201d reasons.\nNineteen other states, including nearby Kentucky and Illinois, have adopted religious liberty laws.\nThe Supreme Court later established religious objections could apply to any type of birth control and now states are using this ruling to justify such religious liberty bills that aim to protect owners who refuse to serve people based on their religious beliefs.\nThe governor signed the law in a private ceremony on Thursday, and wouldn\u2019t say who attended the signing ceremony."}
