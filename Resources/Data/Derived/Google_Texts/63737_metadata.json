But it also is bringing new opportunities for systems to engage with patients in the payment process.\n\nOver the last 15 years, premium increases have significantly exceeded income growth for many Americans, sapping away money that would have gone to salary and wage increases. Average employee health plan premiums increased 60 percent between 2003 and 2013, with the employee share rising 93 percent, according to the Commonwealth Foundation. Meanwhile, average incomes in that time period grew by only 11 percent.\n\nIn every state except Arkansas, Alabama, Hawaii, Louisiana, Mississippi and Wyoming, deductibles have doubled since 2003, increasing on average by 146 percent, according to another Commonwealth Fund study. By 2013, average deductibles exceeded $1,000 in all but three states and the District of Columbia.\n\nGiven this reality, some health systems are trying to help patients avoid high cost bills altogether, by working with insurers to craft value-based plans that offer low out-of-pocket costs for staying in one network, or starting their own plans.\n\n[Also: How consumerism is changing revenue cycle]\n\nOn the small scale, health systems have options that don\u2019t require a big transformation, such as prompt payment discounts, payment plans, pre-payment requirements and front-end outreach.\n\nPatients \u201cneed to be educated on their options for saving,\u201d said Allison Hofmann, vice president of account management of QualCare, a health plan started by 16 New Jersey hospitals that was recently acquired by Cigna. \u201cThere are some very good online tools that support education on the benefits of contributing to HSAs, HRAs and FSAs but it is essential education continues at the employer, health plan and provider level.\u201d\n\nOn the larger scale, for health systems that want to experiment or take risks, there other options that could have a large return for both patients and providers.\n\nIn Los Angeles, seven hospitals, including UCLA Health and Cedars-Sinai, are partnering with Anthem Blue Cross to serve as a preferred network in a health plan called Vivity. Most notably, members on the plan will be responsible for only a copay with no deductible. In this kind of health plan, the physicians, hospital and health plan professionals \u201ccan really leverage off each other\u201d instead of \u201cduplicating costs,\u201d said James West, president and CEO of PIH Health in Whittier, one of the seven partner providers. \u201cReally in the end, we can get a better outcome.\u201d\n\n[Also: What CFOs think about revenue cycle]\n\nOther health systems are building their own health plans in the model of Kaiser Permanente and the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, which run the two largest provider-owned health plans in the country. An increasingly popular way for providers to test their own insurance is through Medicare Advantage, a government-sponsored health plan program that covers one-third of Medicare beneficiaries.\n\nAt least a dozen health systems are running or jointly running Medicare Advantage plans, including Catholic Health Initiatives, Gundersen Health System, Indiana University Health, Mount Sinai, the University of North Carolina Health Care and Health Partners, an HMO-owned by a group of hospital systems with Philadelphia\u2019s fastest growing Medicare Advantage plan.\n\nCommercial group insurance and individual Affordable Care Act plans are the main insurance plans with the highest deductibles, but Medicare Advantage offers a way to test the HMO network and cost-sharing designs that would also be used in commercial populations.\n\nMount Sinai Health System\u2019s Medicare Advantage plans, for instance, are sold in two tiers. The second, more expensive one offers access to providers inside and outside of Mount Sinai \u2013 using the network of managed care company Healthfirst.\n\nThe preferred first tier plan gives seniors lower levels of cost sharing and some fringe benefits if they stay with Mount Sinai providers. Those include no copayments for primary care visits, annual eye exams, and Medicare-covered preventive services, and 12 free round-trip rides to and from medical appointments each year.\n\nTwitter: @AnthonyBrino", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/news/revenue-cycle-hit-rise-high-deductible-health-plans", "image": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/UCLA%20Medical%20Center%20-%20Feature.png", "site_name": "Healthcare Finance News", "description": "Some health systems are trying to help patients avoid high-cost bills altogether, by working with insurers to craft value-based plans that offer low out-of-pocket costs.", "title": "Revenue cycle hit by rise in high-deductible health plans"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/UCLA%20Medical%20Center%20-%20Feature.png"}, "description": "Some health systems are trying to help patients avoid high-cost bills altogether, by working with insurers to craft value-based plans that offer low out-of-pocket costs.", "site": "@HC_Finance", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Revenue cycle hit by rise in high-deductible health plans"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "The rise of patient deductibles is presenting a host of challenges to healthcare providers.
