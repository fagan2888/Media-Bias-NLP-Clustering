Luis Silva scored twice to help D.C. United beat the Colorado Rapids 4-2 on Sunday night.

United (12-7-4) opened the scoring in the 11th minute. Taylor Kemp sent a perfect through-ball to Silva, who faked Drew Moor to the ground and chipped his shot over Clint Irwin for the early lead.

Colorado (8-10-6) answered in the 52nd minute when Dillon Serna’s long-range shot surprised goalkeeper Bill Hamid.

Silva broke the tie in the 67th minute with a half-volley just outside of the 6-yard box off a pass from Sean Franklin.

United made it 3-1 came in the 82nd minute. Kemp’s second assist of the night fed Chris Wolfe, who slipped a shot past a diving Irwin. Fabian Espindola tacked on his eighth of the season, a left-foot blast from the top of the box in the 87th minute.

Deshorn Brown scored in extra time for Colorado.
