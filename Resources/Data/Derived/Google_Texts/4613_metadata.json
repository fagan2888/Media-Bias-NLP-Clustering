The record holder is \u201cFoppa,\u201d who tied his career best to lead Colorado to a 7-3 victory over the Predators.\n\nForsberg scored a goal and assisted on five others to give himself nine points in his past two games, and Milan Hejduk set a career best with five points on two goals and three assists. Forsberg scored six points on March 3, 1999, against tonight\u2019s Avalanche opponent, the Florida Panthers, a night he scored five points in the third period to lead Colorado to a 7-5 victory after trailing 5-0 late in the second period.\n\n\u201cI remember Florida pretty well,\u201d Forsberg said. \u201cI think the points came a little easier today. A couple of times all I did was chip the puck out of the zone to get a 2-on-1 or something.\u201d\n\nIndeed, the performance in Florida was more spectacular, considering the circumstances. Forsberg got the second assist on three Avalanche goals against the Predators. But what made his day astonishing is he scored all his points despite playing a little more than 15 minutes. About every 2 1/2 minutes he was on the ice, the Avs scored.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s one of the best in the business when he\u2019s on, there\u2019s no question about it,\u201d Nashville coach Barry Trotz said.\n\nIf not for Forsberg, Hejduk would have gotten all the ink. The Avs\u2019 winger scored twice on the power play, with his first goal at 13:19 of the first period the game-winner. He extended his league-leading points streak to 12 games and has eight points his past two games, but still fell one point behind Forsberg for the team scoring lead (41-40).\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s fun to play right now,\u201d Hejduk said. \u201cThe whole team is playing really well. When we control the puck, we create a lot of scoring chances and lately we\u2019re doing that.\u201d\n\nHejduk\u2019s goal, which chased Predators starting goalie Tomas Vokoun from the game, made a winner out of Patrick Roy, even though Roy played just one period. Entering the dressing room, Roy began feeling sick with what he thought was the flu. He told coach Tony Granato he couldn\u2019t go on but got credit for the victory because he was in net when the game-winning goal was scored.\n\nThat helps make up for a victory he lost in the 1998-99 season, when he made every save in a victory over Anaheim but backup Craig Billington got the win because he was in net for the game-winner after Roy was pulled by former coach Bob Hartley to buy his power play more time to rest.\n\nRoy smashed two televisions and a VCR in Hartley\u2019s office after the game to show his displeasure.\n\nDavid Aebischer relieved Roy, stopping 22-of-24 shots.\n\n\u201cDavid did a good job,\u201d Roy said. \u201cI just didn\u2019t feel good at all, but I\u2019m feeling better now.\u201d\n\nThe Avalanche was outshot 35-22 by the Predators, a deceiving statistic because the Avs played defensive hockey after a first period they led 4-1 on 11 shots.\n\nThe victory upped Granato\u2019s record to 5-1-0-1 since taking over for Hartley. Forsberg and Hejduk are making his transition look easy.\n\n\u201cPeter had a good night, Milan had a good night and a lot of our skilled guys made some great plays offensively,\u201d Granato said.\n\nRob Blake, Steve Reinprecht, Adam Foote and Mike Keane also scored for Colorado. Blake\u2019s goal, a one-timer off the rush after a pretty crossing pass by Hejduk, gave the Avs a 5-2 lead and took the starch out of a Predators team.\n\nForsberg snapped a wrist shot over the glove of backup goalie Brian Finley 21 seconds later for point No. 5.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s tight in the division right now and in the conference,\u201d Forsberg said. \u201cEvery point is important.\u201d\n\nAdrian Dater: adater@denverpost.com or at twitter.com/adater", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Peter Forsberg fuels rout with six-point effort vs. Predators", "title": "Peter Forsberg fuels rout with six-point effort vs. Predators", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/11/15/peter-forsberg-fuels-rout-with-six-point-effort-vs-predators/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141115_030136_forsberg010103.jpg", "height": 437}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141115_030136_forsberg010103.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-11-15T12:34:22+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T13:25:10+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb4dc\"", "article_summary": "If not for Forsberg, Hejduk would have gotten all the ink.\nThe record holder is \u201cFoppa,\u201d who tied his career best to lead Colorado to a 7-3 victory over the Predators.\nForsberg snapped a wrist shot over the glove of backup goalie Brian Finley 21 seconds later for point No.\nBut what made his day astonishing is he scored all his points despite playing a little more than 15 minutes.\n(Editors\u2019 note: This story was originally published in The Denver Post on Jan. 2, 2003.)"}
