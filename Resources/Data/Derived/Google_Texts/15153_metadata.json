He was there on a family vacation, according to an interview with NewMusicTuesday.com. Seeing the fire, he told his kids, \u201cWhen we wake up, that fire will still be going\u2014just keep burning through the night \u2026 it\u2019s amazing to think that fire never sleeps.\u201d Smith saw the raging fire as a powerful image of the Holy Spirit\u2019s work in the believer\u2019s life.\n\nSuch was the spark for \u201cFire Never Sleeps,\u201d an upbeat single from Smith\u2019s latest solo effort. With punchy drums and drizzling lead guitars, the track bears an uncanny resemblance to U2, made all the stronger by Smith\u2019s Bono-esque vocals as he describes the Holy Spirit\u2019s purifying power: \u201cI feel the heat is rising / the flames on the horizon / are at my door \u2026 the embers of our brokenness / are scattered on the floor / This fire never sleeps / His fire never sleeps.\u201d\n\nSmith\u2019s new album is called Back To The Start. And true to its title, Smith brings a strong \u201cback to basics\u201d sensibility both musically and lyrically. Many of the arrangements are surprisingly stripped down with an almost confessional quality. The opening title track sets the tone with a simple, warm keyboard while Smith mulls over his need for a return to form in his faith: \u201cBack to the start / Where you found me / I give you my heart again.\u201d\n\nWe see you\u2019ve been enjoying the content on our exclusive member website.

Here, a bouncy beat joins an acoustic guitar as Smith exhorts his own soul to remember God\u2019s faithfulness. Smith\u2019s rhythmic delivery creates a funky texture as he acknowledges, \u201cI lost heart / lost soul / lost rhythm in my bones / got to find my God again / I was dead, I was gone, and I thought I was done / You were there in the hurricane.\u201d\n\nSmith achieves real beauty in the melancholy \u201cSong of Solomon.\u201d Gentle piano playing mingles with the spare beauty of Smith\u2019s voice as he laments, \u201cWhen I feel the cold of winter / and this cloak of sadness / I need you / All the evil things that shake me / all the words that break me / I need you.\u201d Listeners may get shivers of delight as Smith\u2019s voice arcs upward to match the greater vantage point where he sees God running over mountains and seas to provide care and comfort.\n\nAlthough Smith takes time to breathe in Back To The Start, fans of his earlier work need not fret. The album also contains its fair share of anthem-style groove-pop that is Smith\u2019s trademark. But there\u2019s more quietness and deliberation appropriate to a man in his 40s rather than his 20s. That being said, even with maturing years there are still reasons to party, and Smith enumerates them in \u201cGod\u2019s Great Dance Floor.\u201d A club beat thumps steadily while horns blast and swing as Smith celebrates, \u201cYou never stop loving us / No matter how far we run / You\u2019ll never give up on us \u2026 I feel alive / I come alive / I am alive on God\u2019s great dance floor.\u201d Even on this more reflective album, Smith reminds us that the believer\u2019s joy is not a quietly contained intellectualism. Spiritual jubilation ought sometimes to involve the whole man, much like King David who \u201cdanced before the Lord with all his might.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "WORLD", "description": "Martin Smith, former lead singer for the Christian rock band Delirious?, stood entranced by a massive forest fire in the mountains of Greece.
