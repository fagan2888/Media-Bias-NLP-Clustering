Despite some dissatisfaction from a small band of conservatives, Speaker John A. Boehner, Ohio Republican, is expected to be re-elected to the post.\n\n\u201cIn all that we do in the Congress, we must keep the hopes, dreams, and aspirations of the American people at the forefront,\u201d Mrs. Pelosi wrote. \u201cWe must all be committed to doing this in a bipartisan way.
