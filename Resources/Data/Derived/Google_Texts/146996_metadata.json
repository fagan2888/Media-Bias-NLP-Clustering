It\u2019s a glitch \u2013 or communication gap \u2013 that has tens of thousands of Utahns left in limbo without coverage.\n\nKenneth Hunt enrolled his family of six for the new health insurance plan through healthcare.gov in November, ditching the coverage he had in the private sector for nearly twenty years. But then, he ran into a problem.\n\n\u201cMy children weren't accepted,\u201d Hunt said.\n\nHealthcare.gov thought Hunt\u2019s four daughters might qualify for coverage through a state program, essentially kicking his kids out of the federal system. The communication between federal and state platforms didn\u2019t happen like it was supposed to.\n\n\u201cYou may think that your whole family is on one policy, but keep in mind that it\u2019s possible that part of your family could be kicked out of that system without the system even disclosing that information to you,\u201d Hunt said of the situation.\n\nJudi Hilman with Arches Health Plan explained.\n\n\u201cHealthcare.gov sends a \u2018flat file\u2019 to the state and says, \u2018you deal with it\u2019 and that data is supposed to be useful,\u201d Hilman said.\n\nNic Dunn with the Department of Workforce Services said: \u201cYou have about 24,000 Utahns who have applied on healthcare.gov. They were told they might be eligible for Medicaid, but because the federal system wasn\u2019t set up to talk to our system yet, the applications were stuck in limbo.\u201d\n\nThe problem and concern now for the Hunt family, and thousands of others, is no coverage for some of their loved ones for months, time some don\u2019t have to spare.\n\n\u201cIf they get hurt or if they get sick, obviously I can be on the line for thousands of dollars,\u201d Hunt said. \u201cThat\u2019s a risk I don\u2019t feel like I should have to take.\u201d\n\nHealthcare.gov looks at a family\u2019s income and how many members there are to make a rough guess if the kids would qualify for Medicaid or CHIP, but it\u2019s the state that ultimately makes that determination. If people applied for coverage on healthcare.gov and got kicked to the state like the Hunt family, if they are eligible for Medicaid or CHIP, that eligibility will start from the date they applied.", "article_metadata": {"description": "SALT LAKE CITY -- Some Utahns enrolling their families into the public health coverage under the Affordable Care Act are finding that not everyone they want to enroll is covered.
