We feed heavy on the game for a summer month and then go into wintry, quadrennial hibernation: TV ratings spike. Newspapers and magazines fill with pre- and post-game analysis. Bars and cafes ring with spectators gasping and clapping and falling over one another to catch a glimpse of the action.\n\nOur short-lived World Cup mania invites a basic incredulity: how is it that Americans everywhere, normally deaf, dumb and blind to the charms of the \u201cbeautiful game,\u201d have suddenly taken so keen an interest in it? Will the country\u2019s focus quickly shift from the soccer pitch to one of its other athletic divertissements, now that the World Cup has ended, and the smoke has cleared from Team U.S.A.? Or are we finally becoming a nation of full-time soccer fanatics?\n\nAs anyone who followed the World Cup punditry over the past month can attest, such questions tended to produce certain patterns of reaction: at one end of the spectrum were the soccer optimists, who viewed our embrace of the World Cup not as a passing flirtation, but as part of a sustained, ever-solidifying national romance with the game. Buttressed by data showing that soccer is growing in popularity among today\u2019s youth and that \u2014 despite negligible television ratings \u2014 attendance at MLS games (America\u2019s Professional Soccer League) is on the rise, they concluded that the sport\u2019s stateside future has never looked brighter.\n\nThen there were the agnostics who participated fully in our soccer jubilee, but questioned whether it would have the traction others hoped for and expected. These skeptics pointed to the obvious: for a majority of Americans, soccer spectatorship still begins and ends with the World Cup \u2014 or, at least, the U.S. national team\u2019s entry into and customarily early exit from the tournament. And they doubted whether the game could ever find equal footing in our already sports-saturated country. (What with all the football and basketball and baseball teams we follow, and the fantasy teams when we\u2019re not following those). Habits, they seemed to remind us, die hard. National sporting habits harder than most.\n\nFinally, at the opposite end of the spectrum, were the game\u2019s recalcitrant opponents, who tried to undercut our enthusiasms by insisting that soccer and America are mutually exclusive. Sounding the battle cry, Ann Coulter, the conservative polemicist, wrote a widely circulated piece denouncing America\u2019s \u201csoccer fetish.\u201d Amidst reports of record-breaking ratings for the U.S.-Portugal group match, Coulter\u2019s patience was apparently stretched beyond the breaking point: \u201cEnough is enough. Any growing interest in soccer can only be a sign of the nation\u2019s moral decay.\u201d Among other sins, she warned us that soccer subverts and downplays \u201cindividual achievement\u201d (translation: it\u2019s socialism in cleats) and what she admiringly described as \u201cthreat of personal disgrace\u201d (i.e., manliness). She called the game boring (too little violence; not enough scoring), and so maddeningly foreign that it reminded her of the \u201cmetric system.\u201d Quelle horreur! According to Coulter, real Americans everywhere (the sort \u201cwhose great-grandfather was born here\u201d) are being brainwashed and victimized by a bunch of sissy, left-wing soccer evangelists. But the true culprit behind all this recent soccerphilia? \u201cTeddy Kennedy\u2019s 1965 immigration law.\u201d\n\n*\n\nAs a display of special pleading and pandering illogic, Coulter\u2019s broadside can hardly be improved upon. Yet there is one aspect of her opposition that may still have its explanatory uses: Coulter views the country\u2019s burgeoning interest in soccer in relation to its ethical life \u2014 or, in her more pointed language, its \u201cmoral decay.\u201d But her alarmism aside, the question of what our response to the World Cup says about the culture at large \u2014 not just what it portends for the future of soccer, which most commentators focused on \u2014 remains important and, if anything, overlooked.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The World Cup taught us it's OK to feel patriotic pride, when we open ourselves up to the world", "title": "Ann Coulter\u2019s real soccer nightmare: How the World Cup awakened our love of a collective", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The World Cup taught us it's OK to feel patriotic pride, when we open ourselves up to the world", "title": "Ann Coulter\u2019s real soccer nightmare: How the World Cup awakened our love of a collective", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/07/20/ann_coulters_real_soccer_nightmare_how_the_world_cup_awakened_our_love_of_a_collective/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/07/coulter_howard.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The World Cup taught us it's OK to feel patriotic pride, when we open ourselves up to the world", "title": "Ann Coulter\u2019s real soccer nightmare: How the World Cup awakened our love of a collective", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/07/coulter_howard.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Lev Mendes", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Ann Coulter, Editor's Picks, Soccer, Sports, World Cup", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Topics: Ann Coulter, Editor's Picks, Soccer, Sports, World Cup, Life NewsLike presidential elections or leap days in February, America\u2019s love affair with soccer seems to happen once every four years.\nWill the country\u2019s focus quickly shift from the soccer pitch to one of its other athletic divertissements, now that the World Cup has ended, and the smoke has cleared from Team U.S.A.?\n\u201cTeddy Kennedy\u2019s 1965 immigration law.\u201d*As a display of special pleading and pandering illogic, Coulter\u2019s broadside can hardly be improved upon.\nThese skeptics pointed to the obvious: for a majority of Americans, soccer spectatorship still begins and ends with the World Cup \u2014 or, at least, the U.S. national team\u2019s entry into and customarily early exit from the tournament.\nWe feed heavy on the game for a summer month and then go into wintry, quadrennial hibernation: TV ratings spike."}
