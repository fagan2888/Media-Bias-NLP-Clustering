And I say \u201cendure\u201d only because I think I've shown respect where, perhaps, I haven't been given any.\n\nThe question is why does Holder believe that he's particularly entitled to respect?\n\nWe've been hearing this line from Obama and his cronies for a while now. People are disrespecting Obama by not calling him president (but calling Bush, Bush, was just fine).\n\nThe issue isn't respect. It's the law.\n\nYou aren't entitled to respect commensurate with your position. That's how it works in feudal societies. The respect you are entitled to is based on how you comport yourself in that position.\n\nWhen you disrespect the entire nation by calling it a \"nation of cowards\" then why should you expect to exchange disrespect for respect?\n\nBut respect or disrespect isn't the point. What Holder calls disrespect mainly consists of attempts to hold him accountable for blatantly violating the law and obstructing justice.\n\nHolder considers that disrespectful.\n\nAnd that's the problem here. This isn't about respect. It's about doing the right thing.\n\nYou can't hijack the government, violate the law, lie about it, obstruct justice, get people killed and then complain that you aren't getting enough respect.\n\nRespect is a form. If everything else is in working order, it's there. If isn't, then there's no place for respect either.", "article_metadata": {"rating": "general", "description": "This isn't about respect.
