Kashfi Halford, CC BY-NC 2.0\n\nThe World Health Organization estimates 15 million babies are born premature every year \u2014 and every year, almost a million of these babies dies from complications. The survival rate, however, may vary depending on the type of treatment or care provided after birth, according to a new study published in The New England Journal of Medicine.\n\n\u201cWe were interested in the differences in outcomes that exist for the earliest preterm infants among US academic medical centers,\u201d Matthew A. Rysavy, study author, said in a press release. \u201cThere are large differences in outcomes, like mortality and childhood delays and disabilities, and we looked at this variation and wanted to understand why it exists.\u201d\n\nRysavy and his team studied nearly 5,000 babies born before 27 weeks at 24 hospitals within the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development Neonatal Research Network; for comparison, babies are usually born 40 weeks into pregnancy. When looking over the data, researchers found babies born at 22 weeks had a nearly one in four chance of survival if they received active care, yet most hospitals did not provide this type of care at 22 weeks. Though during or after 25 weeks of pregnancy, hospitals almost always provided active care.\n\nWhat\u2019s active care? Researchers define this treatment as \u201cany potentially lifesaving intervention administered after birth.\u201d The alternative to active care is comfort care, in which doctors don\u2019t intervene and simply do what they can to make the baby comfortable before he or she dies. The Washington Post cited some doctors are reluctant \u201cto attempt a painful intervention on a newborn that\u2019s unlikely to survive.\u201d\n\nWith such variation among hospitals, study co-author Edward Bell said \u201cthere is a real problem if doctors are talking to parents about their baby\u2019s chances using outcome data that include babies for whom no active treatment was offered.\u201d\n\nThese findings also raise questions about what medical professionals consider the point of viability. The Post reported Roe v. Wade ruled states could not restrict abortions before 28 weeks of pregnancy, \u201cthe earliest a newborn could survive on its own \u2014 but Planned Parenthood v. Casey \u201cdetached the 'viability' marker from the 28-week standard\" in 1992; women still had the right to choose an abortion before viability without this marker.\n\nIn an interview with the New York Times, Bell said he considers 22 weeks a new marker of viability. It's pretty controversial, he concluded, but these results suggest babies at 22 weeks \"deserve a chance.\"\n\nSource: Rysavy, M.A., et al.
