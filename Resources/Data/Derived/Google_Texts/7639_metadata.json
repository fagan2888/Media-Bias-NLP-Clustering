Wade determined that abortion fell under the umbrella of the personal right to privacy.\n\n\u201cHundreds of thousands\u201d of people attended this year\u2019s march, one organizer told the Free Beacon as the demonstrators left the National Mall and walked toward the Supreme Court.\n\nHe was quickly corrected by another organizer, a woman who clarified that the march does not offer official crowd estimates.\n\n\u201cBut when you fill Constitution Avenue, I mean, that should give you a sense of the size,\u201d she said.\n\nThe U.S. Park Police no longer offers official crowd estimates. After their determination that the Million Man March had only attracted 400,000 participants did not go over very well with Louis Farrakhan, Congress directed the Park Police to stop taking headcounts at large gatherings in D.C.\n\nBefore marching to the steps of the Supreme Court, March for Life participants rallied on the Mall and heard from pro-life leaders such as Cantor, Rep. Chris Smith (R., N.J.), and Dr. James Dobson.\n\n\u201cI believe that one day in the not-too-distant future, our movement will be victorious,\u201d Cantor told the crowd.\n\nPledging continued opposition to abortion, Cantor touted the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act, which he said would go to a vote in the House next week.\n\n\u201cNext week the House will vote to end once and for all taxpayer funding of abortions,\u201d Cantor said. \u201cThe people\u2019s House will stand for life.\u201d\n\nSmith built on Cantor\u2019s opening, praising members of the pro-life community for braving the cold.\n\n\u201cDespite the fact that President Obama is using stealth, deception and the coercion of the state to promote the violence of abortion,\u201d Smith said, \u201cthe pro-life movement is alive and well.\u201d\n\nHe said that over 200 pro-life bills were passed around the country in 2013.\n\nSmith also noted that Obamacare\u2019s provision of taxpayer funding for abortion came despite previous presidential assurances\u2014and an executive order\u2014that the Affordable Care Act would do no such thing.\n\nDobson\u2019s presence represented part of the March\u2019s makeover this year.\n\nThe March has long been dominated by Catholics, with many Catholic schools busing students to D.C. for the event, but this year organizers sought to appeal to a broader coalition of faith groups, and the evangelical Dobson fit the bill.\n\n\u201cYour faces are cold, but your hearts are on fire,\u201d Dobson told the crowd,\n\nSkies were clear, but the temperature in D.C. hovered around 18 degrees. The wind chill made it feel like single digits.\n\nPresent in the crowd were John Zimmerman and Tyrel Bramwell, both Lutheran seminarians at Concordia Theological Seminary in Fort Wayne, Ind.\n\nThe pair acknowledged the overwhelming presence of Roman Catholics at the march, but they dismissed the notion that the heavy Catholic presence made other religions feel excluded.\n\n\u201cThis is about unity among Christians, and non-Christians even,\u201d Zimmerman said. \u201cIt\u2019s about all of us coming together to celebrate the gift of life from our Creator.\u201d\n\nMany marchers traveled long distances to be there.\n\nBrian Curran, a freshman at Benedictine College in Atchison, Kan., said he spent about 24 hours on the bus ride to D.C. He will end up missing a full three days of classes.\n\nHe said he was attending the march to demonstrate solidarity with other pro-life activists.\n\n\u201cThe media likes to marginalize us as a fringe group,\u201d Brian said. \u201c500,000 people is not a fringe group.\u201d\n\nBenedictine sent eight buses, containing one-fifth of the school\u2019s entire student body, to the march this year, while other schools including the Catholic University of America, Franciscan University of Steubenville, and Christendom College sent thousands of their own students.\n\nThis year\u2019s march comes as opinions on abortion are in flux.\n\nA Gallup poll from January 2013 indicated that most Americans support the Roe v. Wade decision.\n\nOther polling has found that most Americans do not consider abortion to be an important issue, and that less than half of adults under 30 could even say what Roe v. Wade had determined.\n\nPro-lifers have a glimmer of hope, however, in the form of a Knights of Columbus/Marist poll showing that, while most Americans want abortion to be legal under certain circumstances, 62 percent think abortion is morally wrong and the vast majority would approve of some restrictions.\n\nThe 2014 March for Life ended as many past marches have: freezing pro-life activists rallied in front of the Supreme Court, listening to the tearful testimonies of women who regret having abortions\u2014before rushing the encircling Capitol Police to ask for directions to Union Station.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Feature: Pro-life marchers make their voices heard in Washington, D.C.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Free Beacon", "description": "They came from North Dakota and Kansas and closer to the nation\u2019s capital, bringing their signs, their voices, and, in many cases, their children as they braved single-digit weather to express their", "title": "Thousands Brave the Cold to March for Life", "url": "http://freebeacon.com/issues/thousands-brave-the-cold-to-march-for-life/", "image": "http://freebeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/March-for-Life-2014-150x150.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://freebeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/March-for-Life-2014-150x150.jpg", "title": "Thousands Brave the Cold to March for Life", "description": "They came from North Dakota and Kansas and closer to the nation\u2019s capital, bringing their signs, t", "card": "summary", "site": "@freebeacon"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1047859882", "fb": {"app_id": "FB_APP_ID"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc99b7\"", "article_summary": "\u201cI believe that one day in the not-too-distant future, our movement will be victorious,\u201d Cantor told the crowd.\nA Gallup poll from January 2013 indicated that most Americans support the Roe v.
