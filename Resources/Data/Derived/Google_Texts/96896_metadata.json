If any given person only gets to talk to a candidate two times before primary day, it\u2019s considered an insult, a snub. Most people would tire of the never-ending exposure to pandering primary candidates, showing up at their diners or Chick-fil-As or sports bars for folksy conversations with \u201ceveryday folks.\u201d This isn\u2019t even counting the bombardment of television ads, set to commence soon, as candidates \u201cseriously considering the possibility of running for president,\u201d as Jeb Bush puts it, make it official. But they love it up here. One attendee at an event this weekend was handing out business cards. The occupation? \u201cRegistered New Hampshire Voter.\u201d\n\nThe official candidates \u2014 Rand Paul, Marco Rubio, and Ted Cruz \u2014 gathered at Nashua, New Hampshire\u2019s Crowne Plaza hotel this Friday and Saturday for the First in the Nation Republican Leadership Summit. The summit also featured unofficial candidates who are almost certainly running but can\u2019t quite say so yet for legal/fundraising reasons: Scott Walker, Chris Christie, Jeb Bush, Bobby Jindal, Rick Perry, Carly Fiorina, and Mike Huckabee, to name a few. You also had your for-pretend candidates, like Donald Trump and Lindsey Graham. Beneath them are the YOLO candidates, like former Virginia Gov. Jim Gilmore, former New York Gov. George Pataki, and former U.N. ambassador John Bolton. All here. Former Maryland Gov. Bob Ehrlich occupies whatever tier is beneath Gilmore and Pataki, and he was here, too. At the very bottom of the pile is this guy. Here.\n\nNew Hampshire Republicans are not the same as Iowa Republicans. They\u2019re blunt and talk fast and are in no way intimidated to ask a governor or senator or ambassador whatever\u2019s on their mind, in a shrewd, distrusting what\u2019s your angle here? sort of way. There\u2019s a libertarian bent to the state\u2019s conservative politics and, by and large, no one wants to waste any precious time talking about, say, gay marriage.\n\nThis is not to say that the conservative die-hards in New Hampshire don\u2019t have their own quirks. The ones in attendance at the FITN summit, at least, care a lot about ISIS establishing beachheads on the continent and the scourge of \u201cillegals.\u201d If you were wondering last fall why New Hampshire GOP Senate candidate Scott Brown kept going on about ISIS fighters crossing the southern border to infect Americans with Ebola, a few conversations at the Crowne Plaza in Nashua would make it quite clear. There\u2019s a paranoid style to New Hampshire politics.\n\n***\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s trying to destroy the country,\u201d a woman in black-and-white shoes and a Diane Keaton-style tie/vest combination, whispered to me during the speech from former U.N. Ambassador John Bolton. She was referring to the current Democratic president \u2014 or \u201cDemocrat president,\u201d in the parlance of right-wing conferences. Bolton had just said that the \u201cprinciple responsibility of the President of the United States is to protect the country,\u201d and for this woman, and presumably everyone else in the room, Barack Obama has performed poorly on that score.\n\nBizarrely enough, I\u2019m more familiar with Bolton\u2019s talking points than any other candidate\u2019s, and the man presents a terrifying view of the world. Everyone is trying to bomb us and our president won\u2019t bomb them, and Bolton can\u2019t stand this, and he\u2019s going to make America care about his particular brand of foreign policy and not all these wishy-washy foofoo issues like education or health care. ISIS is coming for us, Russia is coming for us, China, you name it. And oh, this Iran deal? \u201cThe most serious act of appeasement in American history.\u201d Bolton likes to close with a dose of levity, about how he has a special understanding of Hillary Clinton since he was a year apart from Bill and Hillary at Yale Law School. Hillary was a \u201cradical\u201d then, and she\u2019s a radical now. According to Bolton, the way people are in graduate school is pretty much the way they are the rest of their lives, and Hillary Clinton is every bit the leftist that Elizabeth Warren and Barack Obama are. Scared yet?\n\n\u201cI read an article in the Investor\u2019s Business Daily that scared the crap out of me,\u201d an older man began his question to Bolton. Turns out ISIS is setting up training camps in New Mexico, or maybe it\u2019s Mexico-Mexico, and they\u2019re pouring across the border. (The article in question cites a report from Judicial Watch, a right-wing paranoiac crank website, saying ISIS has \u201cspotters\u201d in New Mexico to aid in deadly terrorist crossings.) This news didn\u2019t surprise John Bolton at all. John Bolton is never surprised. John Bolton has seen some things.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been reading some things about ISIL,\u201d another older man says. He\u2019s been reading the Internet and you just won\u2019t believe the stuff he\u2019s finding. ISIS is trying to establish a Caliphate and, according to the Koran, once the Caliphate is established, all Muslims are required to pledge allegiance to it and kill all non-participants. Why aren\u2019t we stopping Islam? John Bolton is of course aware of this, and not surprised by it, and to him the fact that Barack Obama won\u2019t even name the enemy gives the enemy enormous power.\n\nBut these two questioners were warm-up acts for the Greatest Question Ever. It came from the woman sitting next to me, the same one who had whispered to me earlier that Obama is \u201ctrying to destroy the country.\u201d She didn\u2019t mean this metaphorically. She had evidence \u2014 proof so ironclad that it could only have come from a weird multicolor-font chain email that old people forward to each other.\n\n\u201cWhat do you think about the War on Terror within?\u201d She asks? Obama has been \u201cfilling the government with Muslims. He is filling the State Department with the Muslim Brotherhood.\u201d It gets worse. This woman has also heard that Barack Obama is \u201camassing tanks and artillery weapons\u201d to stage a revolution \u201cin the streets.\u201d He may have several four- and five-star generals who are going along with this. And then there\u2019s the\u2013\n\n\u201cThe answer is no,\u201d John Bolton cut her off, laughing nervously. She had managed to surprise John Bolton, and that\u2019s an accomplishment.\n\n***\n\n\u201cWell, you\u2019re probably nicer to me than the conservative media,\u201d Mike Huckabee told me, after I was introduced to him as a reporter from a liberal news outlet.\n\nI had been watching him on Fox News from the hotel lounge, announcing that he announce his presidential decision in early May. Right after the segment aired, Mike Huckabee walked through the lounge on his way to something else. Like a moron, I pointed at the TV and said to him \u201cYOU WERE JUST ON THE TV,\u201d as though bewildered that someone can climb out of a television set and into real life.\n\nCan\u2019t say I\u2019ve ever been very nice to Mike Huckabee, but it\u2019s true that he\u2019s about to go to war with conservative media. Small-government fiscal conservatives have never liked Huckabee. For all outspoken social conservatism and a foreign policy informed by fundamentalist interpretation of Revelation, he\u2019s never been much of a budget-cutter. (He\u2019ll claim that a lot of this had to do with the Democratic legislature he dealt with when he was governor of Arkansas.) And in the past few days, he\u2019s been the (unofficial) presidential candidate coming out hardest against Chris Christie\u2019s plan to cut Social Security.\n\nHe\u2019s not framing it in liberal terms \u2014 about how means-testing Social Security would welfarize the program and erode its support \u2014 and he looked sort of confused when I tried to explain that argument. But Huckabee has a problem, as a vast majority of those affected almost certainly will, with people paying into Social Security for decades and then not getting back what\u2019s owed them, whether those cuts come in the form of means-testing, a raise in the retirement age, or linking cost-of-living increases to chained CPI. And since he\u2019s a professional politician who understands his audience, he\u2019s spinning it another way: the government is stealing the money of the people. You lent the government your money, and they\u2019re not letting you have it back. It\u2019s Big Government Theft. That\u2019ll do.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Nineteen potential presidential candidates convened in New Hampshire this weekend.
