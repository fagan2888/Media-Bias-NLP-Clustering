Chris Christie.\n\n\"@BonJovi, Happy to see you accept the #IceBucketChallenge, but even happier to help you complete it,\" the governor tweeted this evening.\n\nWearing a white T-shirt and dark shorts, Bon Jovi looks straight into the camera.\n\n\u201cOn behalf of myself and my friends back here, I want you to know I wanted to be the first to rise to the occasion. I accept the challenge,\u201d he says. Then he gives the signal: \u201cOkay, guys.\u201d\n\nThe video shows Bon Jovi laughing as Christie and New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft pick up a receptacle full of water, lift it to shoulder height and pour it over him.\n\nAs is the custom, Bon Jovi then issued his own challenge \u2014 to fellow Bon Jovi bandmates David Bryan, Tico Torres, and Richie Sambora.\n\nChristie himself was doused last week and then challenged U.S. Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.), who accepted.\n\nThe \"Ice Bucket Challenge\" is a public awareness and fundraising campaign that aims to fight the degenerative disease ALS. Videos of people who have accepted the challenge after being nominated by friends have been flooding Facebook since the campaign got underway in late July. The rules give those nominated 24 hours to get iced or donate $100 to a charity working on the incurable disease \u2014 or both.", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "'@entertainment','@news','@politics','@river','chris-christie','jon-bon-jovi'", "title": "WATCH: Jon Bon Jovi takes the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge, with Christie's help", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"WATCH: Jon Bon Jovi takes the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge, with Christie\\u0027s help\", \"link\": \"http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2014/08/jon_bon_jovi_takes_the_ice_bucket_challenge_with_christies_help.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://imgick.nj.com/home/njo-media/width620/img/ledgerupdates_impact/photo/2014/08/16/15636482-standard.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"13665381\", \"pub_date\": \"2014-08-16T23:41:29Z\", \"author\": \"Richard Khavkine\", \"tags\": [\"@entertainment\",\"@news\",\"@politics\",\"@river\",\"chris-christie\",\"jon-bon-jovi\"] }", "twitter": {"image": "http://media.nj.com/ledgerupdates_impact/photo/2014/08/16/15636482-thumb_square_large.jpg", "description": "Add rocker Jon Bon Jovi to the long list of celebrities who have joined the effort to raise awareness and money to fight ALS", "card": "summary", "site": "@njdotcom"}, "article_date_updated": "Monday, August 18, 2014,  1:34 PM", "parsely-metadata": "{\"image_url\": \"http://media.nj.com/ledgerupdates_impact/photo/2014/08/16/bon-jovi-christie-bucket-challengejpg-52f8fac237298c9b.jpg\", \"author_name\": \"RichardKhavkine\", \"author_nickname\": \"Richard Khavkine\", \"author_id\": \"9827199\", \"source_blog_name\": \"New Jersey Real-Time News\", \"source_blog_url\": \"http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/\", \"sponsored_content\": \"0\" }", "og": {"site_name": "NJ.com", "description": "Add rocker Jon Bon Jovi to the long list of celebrities who have joined the effort to raise awareness and money to fight ALS", "title": "WATCH: Jon Bon Jovi takes the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge, with Christie's help", "url": "http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2014/08/jon_bon_jovi_takes_the_ice_bucket_challenge_with_christies_help.html", "image": "http://media.nj.com/design/alpha/img/logo_njo.gif", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "NJ.com", "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Saturday, August 16, 2014,  7:41 PM", "article_author": "Richard Khavkine", "Description": "Add rocker Jon Bon Jovi to the long list of celebrities who have joined the effort to raise awareness and money to fight ALS"}, "article_summary": "As is the custom, Bon Jovi then issued his own challenge \u2014 to fellow Bon Jovi bandmates David Bryan, Tico Torres, and Richie Sambora.\nWearing a white T-shirt and dark shorts, Bon Jovi looks straight into the camera.\nAdd New Jersey rocker Jon Bon Jovi to the long list of celebrities who have joined the Ice Bucket Challenge, raising awareness and money to fight ALS, or Lou Gehrig's Disease.\nThe \"Ice Bucket Challenge\" is a public awareness and fundraising campaign that aims to fight the degenerative disease ALS.\nThen he gives the signal: \u201cOkay, guys.\u201dThe video shows Bon Jovi laughing as Christie and New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft pick up a receptacle full of water, lift it to shoulder height and pour it over him."}
