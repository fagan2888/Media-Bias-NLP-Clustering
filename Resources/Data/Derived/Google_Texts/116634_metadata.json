Adam Schiff (D-CA) announced his support for the Iran deal. In a statement, Schiff, the ranking member of the House intelligence committee, admitted the deal\u2019s flaws, but said he was supporting it because he believed there was no alternative. He also said that Congress should work with the administration to make the Iran deal stronger.\n\nSchiff\u2019s apparent shift from skeptic to supporter offers a model for other Democrats to follow: acknowledge that the Iran deal does not work, but vote for it and pretend that it can be improved.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nThat is the same approach that Democrats took on Obamacare: pass it first, fix it later (though unconstitutional executive actions, if not legislative amendments).\n\nThe difference is that unlike Obamacare, the Iran deal cannot be amended once it takes effect. Iran will treat any changes as a violation of the deal, and will back out of it.\n\nFurthermore, with Obamacare, we could \u201cfind out what\u2019s in it\u201d after it passed, in Nancy Pelosi\u2019s infamous formulation. With the Iran deal, there are confidential side agreements that Congress may never be able to see.\n\nSchiff admits that the deal is severely flawed. In his lengthy explanation, Schiff says it is \u201cdeeply disturbing\u201d that there is a \u201clack of robust access to the sites of Iran\u2019s past military work on nuclear weapons\u201d and \u201cthe size, sophistication and international legitimacy of Iran\u2019s enrichment capability allowed in only fifteen years.\u201d\n\nAnd yet, he says, \u201cI have searched for a better, credible alternative and concluded that there is none.\u201d That argument\u2013which, even if true, is due only to the administration\u2019s poor negotiating\u2013may sway many other Democrats.\n\nSchiff\u2013who says he is troubled, but baffled, by Israeli opposition to the deal\u2013concludes by consoling himself with the thought that even if the deal fails, and force becomes necessary to stop Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon, \u201cthe American people and others around the world will recognize that we did everything possible to avoid war.\u201d\n\nBut Schiff ignores the heavy costs we may pay in the interim.\n\nArguably, a stronger deal would be a more effective way to avoid war, since the current deal will prompt an arms race, or an Israeli pre-emptive strike.\n\nSchiff\u2019s decision comes as a new Quinnipiac poll shows that American voters want Congress to reject the Iran deal by a 2-to-1 margin. His support, however, may sway enough Democrats to deny the House the 2/3 majority it will need to override President Barack Obama\u2019s veto of its disapproval of the deal.\n\nThough Schiff\u2019s statement on the Iran deal is clearly the result of extensive deliberation, it is likely that political considerations played a key role. Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi\u2013to whom he owes his committee position\u2013promises the deal would pass.\n\nBizarrely, Schiff offers several suggestions for making the Iran deal stronger. For example, he says Iran should \u201cnever be permitted to produce highly enriched uranium.\u201d He also says that the U.S. should help Israel destroy Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities if Iran finds better ways of shielding them. The first suggestion was deliberately excluded from the Iran deal, and the second is explicitly precluded by it.\n\nBut there is no way to improve the Iran deal without rejecting it first. Schiff wants to have it both ways, and weasels out of voting \u201cno.\u201d\n\nOthers will follow.\n\nThis post has been updated.", "article_metadata": {"description": "On Monday, Rep.
