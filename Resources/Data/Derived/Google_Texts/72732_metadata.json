Likewise, you\u2019re right that President Obama misled voters when he said that everyone could keep their insurance plan because that\u2019s now manifestly not true (although they will be able to get new and better plans, sometimes for less money).\u201d\n\n\u201cBut how about showing empathy also for a far larger and more desperate group: The nearly 50 million Americans without insurance who play health care Russian roulette as a result. FamiliesUSA, a health care advocacy group that supports Obamacare, estimated last year that an American dies every 20 minutes for lack of insurance. It has been a year since my college roommate, Scott Androes, died of prostate cancer, in part because he didn\u2019t have insurance and thus didn\u2019t see a doctor promptly. Scott fully acknowledged that he had made a terrible mistake in economizing on insurance, but, in a civilized country, is this a mistake that people should die from?\u201d\n\n\u201cWebsite problems are a nuisance,\u201d Dr. Gibson said. \u201cLife and death is when you need care and can\u2019t afford to get it.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Institute of Medicine and the National Research Council this year ranked the United States health care system last or near last in several categories among 17 countries studied. The Commonwealth Fund put the United States dead last of seven industrialized countries in health care performance. And Bloomberg journalists ranked the United States health care system No. 46 in efficiency worldwide, behind Romania and Iran. The reason is simple: While some Americans get superb care, tens of millions without insurance get marginal care. That\u2019s one reason life expectancy is relatively low in America, and child mortality is twice as high as in some European countries. Now that\u2019s a scandal. Yet about half the states are refusing to expand Medicaid to cover more uninsured people\u2013because they don\u2019t trust Obamacare and want it to fail\u201d, said Senator Reid (source: Congressional Record http://thomas.loc.gov).\n\nSee related article and video: Is Obamacare Enough?
