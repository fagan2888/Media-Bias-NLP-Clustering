They are afraid of being called naughty names. They are being afraid of being called awful things.\u201d\n\nAt one point, he wondered aloud why President Obama isn\u2019t being investigated.\n\n\u201cWhy isn\u2019t there a special prosecutor for the president on Obamacare?\u201d Beck asked. \u201cHe looked at the American people and lied.\u201d\n\nHe then likened the current situation in Washington, D.C. to the nuclear disaster that occurred decades ago at Chernobyl in the Ukraine. Beck offered the solution he said was employed to end that catastrophe as a way to repair our toxic political system.\n\n\u201cThey called them all together and said, \u2018You have 30 seconds to be in that room. You have 30 seconds, here\u2019s your job. You\u2019re going to go in, you\u2019re going to open the door and make sure the door is open and get out. You, you\u2019re going to go in, you\u2019re going to find the light switch, it\u2019s going to be right here \u2014 you\u2019re going to turn it on and get out. Then you\u2019re going in \u2014 you\u2019re going to find the panel. You\u2019re going to make sure the red light is on the panel, then you\u2019re going to get out.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cLines of people. Why?\u201d Beck asked. \u201cBecause it was radiation, it was going to kill them. Cause cancer.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have got news for you: That\u2019s Washington, D.C. It\u2019s Chernobyl,\u201d he said. \u201cYou, you go in. You open the door. Then you get out. Then you, you go in. You make sure the document is still there. Then you get out. That\u2019s what it should be. We are dealing with Chernobyl. It is a meltdown of our system.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have got news for you: That\u2019s Washington, D.C. It\u2019s Chernobyl.\u201d Share:\n\nBeck previously warned Republicans that if they embrace establishment politicians such as Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) and Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio), the party would eventually cease to exist.\n\n\u201cIf the GOP wants to not just win, if the GOP expects to survive \u2014 if you embrace John McCain and John Boehner it will not happen,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you embrace the Mike Lees and the Ted Cruzes, you win big time.\u201d\n\nEarlier in the evening Beck presented the audience with a list of artifacts, including a letter Gen. \u201cMad\u201d Anthony Wayne wrote at 2 a.m. following the Battle of Stony Point during the Revolutionary War.\n\n\u201cHe writes this letter to George Washington and this is it and it says, \u2018Dear General, the forts and the garrison with Colonel Johnston are ours. Your officers and men behaved like men determined to be free.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen I first read this letter, I thought to myself, \u2018What does that even mean?\u2019\u201d Beck asked. \u201cWhat does it mean to behave like a man determined to be free? If everybody in the country would ask that one question and answer it every single day \u2026 the country would change overnight.\u201d\n\n\u2013\n\nFollow Oliver Darcy (@oliverdarcy) on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30; polling-uri=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/1.xml; polling-uri2=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/2.xml; polling-uri3=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/3.xml; polling-uri4=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/4.xml", "application-name": "TheBlaze.com", "twitter": {"description": "Glenn Beck skewered the GOP while delivering the keynote address at a local Texas GOP's Reagan Day dinner, contending the Republican Party hasn't demonstrated through action that it actually believes the principles it espouses.  \"If you believe in something, show me the action,\" Beck said at the Saturday...", "creator": "@oliverdarcy", "url": "http://www.theblaze.com/stories/2014/02/02/glenn-beck-hammers-republican-party-in-scathing-speech-to-texas-gop-group-likens-d-c-to-chernobyl/", "image": "http://www.theblaze.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Screen-Shot-2014-02-02-at-2.50.04-PM-620x339.jpg", "title": "Glenn Beck Hammers Republican Party In Scathing Speech to Texas GOP Group, Likens D.C. to Chernobyl", "site": "@theblaze", "card": "summary", "account_id": 1512944287}, "keywords": "glenn, beck, hammers, republican, party, scathing, speech, texas, gop, group, likens, d, c, chernobyl", "sailthru.tags": "glenn-beck, gop, politics, video, author-oliver-darcy, site-theblazecom", "facebook-count": 15426, "gplus-count": 15, "msapplication-TileColor": "#282b2d", "sailthru.guid": "theblazecom/754951", "categories": "glenn-beck,gop,video,politics", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://www.theblaze.com/wp-content/plugins/theblaze_livetile/img/medium150x150.png", "comment-count": 266, "description": "Glenn Beck skewered the GOP while delivering the keynote address at a local Texas GOP's Reagan Day dinner, contending the Republican Party hasn't demonstrated through action that it actually believes the principles it espouses.  \"If you believe in something, show me the action,\" Beck said at the Saturday...", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://www.theblaze.com/wp-content/plugins/theblaze_livetile/img/wide310x150.png", "linkedin-count": 4, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://www.theblaze.com/wp-content/plugins/theblaze_livetile/img/small70x70.png", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://www.theblaze.com/wp-content/plugins/theblaze_livetile/img/large310x310.png", "fb": {"admins": 517831498}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.theblaze.com/", "viewport": "width=device-width", "og": {"site_name": "The Blaze", "description": "Glenn Beck skewered the GOP while delivering the keynote address at a local Texas GOP's Reagan Day dinner, contending the Republican Party hasn't demonstrated through action that it actually believes the principles it espouses.  \"If you believe in something, show me the action,\" Beck said at the Saturday...", "title": "Glenn Beck Hammers Republican Party In Scathing Speech to Texas GOP Group, Likens D.C. to Chernobyl", "url": "http://www.theblaze.com/stories/2014/02/02/glenn-beck-hammers-republican-party-in-scathing-speech-to-texas-gop-group-likens-d-c-to-chernobyl/", "image": {"width": 620, "identifier": "http://www.theblaze.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Screen-Shot-2014-02-02-at-2.50.04-PM-620x339.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "height": 339}, "type": "article"}, "dc.date": "2014-02-02T16:03:44+00:00", "twitter-count": 596}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd14de\"", "article_summary": "You, you\u2019re going to go in, you\u2019re going to find the light switch, it\u2019s going to be right here \u2014 you\u2019re going to turn it on and get out.\nYou\u2019re going to go in, you\u2019re going to open the door and make sure the door is open and get out.\nYou\u2019re going to make sure the red light is on the panel, then you\u2019re going to get out.\u2019\u201d\u201cLines of people.\nThen you\u2019re going in \u2014 you\u2019re going to find the panel.\n\u201cWhy isn\u2019t there a special prosecutor for the president on Obamacare?\u201d Beck asked."}
