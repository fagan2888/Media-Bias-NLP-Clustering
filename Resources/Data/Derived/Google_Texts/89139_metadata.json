That was 51 percent more than the 19,930 job cuts tracked during the same period a year ago.\n\nJob cuts in the telecommunications industry increased 342 percent to 13,044 this year from 5,214 in the first half of 2013.\n\nMeanwhile, job cuts announced by the electronics industry were up 43 percent from a year ago, rising to 5,356 from 3,739.\n\n\"Increased job cutting is not always a sign of an industry in decline,\u201d said John Challenger, the group's chief executive officer.\n\n\u201cThe technology is, in fact, one of the bright spots of the economy. Many of the job cuts we are seeing are more indicative of an industry in transition than of one in decline.\u201d\n\nFor example, Hewlett-Packard, which announced it would reduce its workforce by as many as 16,000 employees, is trying to catch up with consumers switching from personal computers and printers to smartphones and tablets.\n\n\u201cThe technology sector is stronger than ever, but it has always been an area of frequent and rapid change,\" Challenger said. \"Tech jobs, going forward, will not necessarily be confined to technology firms; the biggest growth will be in industries such as healthcare, manufacturing, automotive and retail.\"\n\nRecent reports show that the technology sector is poised for growth. In April, a worldwide tech industry outlook concluded that global spending on information technology will increase 3.2 percent to $3.77 trillion in 2014.\n\n\u201cSo, when we see large job-cut announcements from the likes of Microsoft and HP, it should not be assumed that the entire industry or the economy, as a whole, are in distress,\" Challenger said.\n\n\"Even in the strongest economy, companies may make significant adjustments to their payrolls. The surge in technology sector job cuts this year are a sign of an industry adjusting to growth, rather than of one adjusting to contraction.\"", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Layoffs in the technology sector could reach their highest level in five years amid strong growth potential.", "description": "Layoffs in the technology sector could reach their highest level in five years amid strong growth potential.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Vicki Needham", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "Layoffs in the technology sector could reach their highest level in five years amid strong growth potential.", "title": "Tech layoffs could hit highest level since 2009", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/finance/213544-tech-sector-layoffs-could-hit-highest-level-since-2009-amid-a-growth-pattern", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/thehill_logo_200.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-04T04:20:37-05:00", "type": "article"}, "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-04T04:20-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/finance/213544-tech-sector-layoffs-could-hit-highest-level-since-2009-amid-a-growth-pattern", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "dcterms.date": "2014-07-28T17:05-04:00", "dcterms.creator": "Vicki Needham", "dcterms.type": "Text", "article": {"published_time": "2014-07-28T17:05:10-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-04T04:20:37-05:00"}, "keywords": "Business,,Challenger, Gray & Christmas, Microsoft, Hewlett-Packard", "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/finance/213544-tech-sector-layoffs-could-hit-highest-level-since-2009-amid-a-growth-pattern", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "Layoffs in the technology sector could reach their highest level in five years amid strong growth potential.", "card": "summary", "title": "Tech layoffs could hit highest level since 2009"}, "dcterms.title": "Tech layoffs could hit highest level since 2009"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf10e\"", "article_summary": "ADVERTISEMENTAt the current rate, the 2014 year-end total could be the highest since 2009, when tech-sector job cuts hit 174,629.\nLayoffs in the technology sector could reach their highest level in five years, according to a group that tracks employments trends.\nThe highest total on record was 695,581 job cuts in 2001, when the tech bubble in the stock market burst.\nThat was 51 percent more than the 19,930 job cuts tracked during the same period a year ago.\nMeanwhile, job cuts announced by the electronics industry were up 43 percent from a year ago, rising to 5,356 from 3,739."}
