Slavitt\n\nActing Administrator\n\nCenters for Medicare & Medicaid Services\n\n200 Independence Ave, S.W.\n\nWashington, D.C. 20201\n\nDear Mr. Slavitt,\n\nThe Senate Finance Committee is charged with overseeing the administration of federal healthcare programs. I write today to express my concerns about the lack of transparency of agency advertising practices and the potential for wasteful government spending.\n\nRecent media reports have highlighted the lack of transparency surrounding government expenditures on advertising and public relations. Agency spending on advertising has been characterized as a \u201cblack box\u201d since it is difficult to track and monitor agency spending on advertising. This is in part due to the lack of a standardized definition of what specifically constitutes \u201cadvertising,\u201d as well as a lack of a central reporting authority.\n\nA 2014 CRS report estimated that in FY2013, the federal government spent nearly $900 million dollars on advertising, and another $90 million on public relations.//bschott%40utahpolicy%This email address is being protected from spambots.

It is surprising that nearly $1 billion is being spent on advertising yet there is little understanding of the exact amount of money being spent, how the money is being spent and why the money is being spent.\n\nIn this era of fiscal constraint, it is imperative that agencies make smart budgetary decisions and use taxpayer funds wisely. Increased transparency on government spending on advertising will improve accountability and help ensure that the taxes from hardworking Americans are not squandered and wasted on ineffective or misguided government programs.\n\nIn order to better understand your agency\u2019s advertising policies and practices please answer the following questions no later than November 30, 2015:\n\nPlease provide the total amount of spending on advertising and public relations by your agency from FY 2011 to the present. Please further break down this spending between outside contracts and in-house spending. How does your agency define \u201cadvertising\u201d? What activities and expenditures fall under your definition? Please explain your agency\u2019s decision process to engage in advertising. How does your agency determine the objectives of an advertising campaign or activity? How does your agency fund advertising activities? Who approves advertising projects? Please provide a copy of all written agency policies that help govern advertising decisions. How does your agency monitor and manage advertising activities and what follow-up is conducted to evaluate that the advertising accomplished its intended objectives? How does your agency hold decision makers accountable? Who in your agency oversees all advertising decisions and is responsible for ensuring that advertising spending is appropriate, legal, and effective? Please explain their role in the agency decision-making process. Please provide a list of all agency advertising, public relations and media relations, related expenditures from FY 2011 to the present. Furthermore, for FY 2014 to the present please provide an explanation as to why each advertising decisions was made and the source of the funds.\n\nThank you for your cooperation and timely response, and I look forward to working with you to improve transparency and accountability on this important matter.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) sent a letter to Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) Acting Administrator Andrew M.
