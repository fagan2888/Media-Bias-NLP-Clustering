DIY: Valentine's Day

After cutting out a hand on construction paper, unfold to reveal a heart. Decorate however you’d like.

A simple Valentine’s Day card can be made by tracing your hand on a folded piece of construction paper. Just keep the pointer finger and thumb connected when cutting it out.

Valentine’s Day seems to be a holiday of puns. Put “I’m nuts about you” on nut candies or nuts. Just be aware of nut allergies recipients might have.

For an easy, portable and unique way to tell someone what you like about them, simply write or print out and glue a reason you love them on each card in a deck. Put the cards back in the box or punch a hole in each corner and attach with a ring.

Valentine’s Day-themed phrases can make even simple tokens the perfect gift for the holiday. For example, print out or write “We’re mint to be” on mints or mint candies. (Republican Eagle photos by Danielle Killey)

Valentine’s Day is just around the corner, and many people, from students to parents to young couples, are looking for ways to show friends and loved ones what they mean to them.

But with the expenses of the holidays likely still fresh on your mind (and wallet), making your own Valentine’s gifts and cards might be the way to go. Plus, you can personalize them more with the recipients’ favorite foods, photographs or memories.
