Lopez is a multi-talented singer, dancer and actress, but she is also a woman with breasts, something that Renner astutely observed at the end of his intro, muttering: \u201cYou got the Globes, too.\u201d As one does during these shows, people instantly took to twitter to criticize Renner for the dopey remark (or to praise his chutzpah).\n\nRenner is a known jerk.
