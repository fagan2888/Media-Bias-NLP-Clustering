The final results do not indicate any cause and effect, or \"identify points at which staffing levels become unsafe or begin to have negative effects on outcomes,\" said State Health Commissioner Edward Ehlinger, M.D.\n\nA work group comprising leaders in both the nurse and hospital sectors requested daily, unit-specific counts of patients and nurses in 2013, according to the article. However, Hennepin County Medical Center was the only hospital able to produce the data, as the other hospitals did not have access to detailed information on staffing and patient counts.\n\nMHA spokeswoman Wendy Burt said the lack of data was the result of logistical issues rather than stonewalling by hospitals, and that it proved the difficulty of assessing the effect of ratios.\n\n\"Caring for a patient is done by a whole care team, including physicians, including nurses,\" she said, \"but also including other members as needed by the patients' illnesses or conditions--from nursing assistants to respiratory therapists to dietitians.\"\n\nMinnesota is not the only state where hospital and nurse groups have clashed on the issue of nurse ratios.
