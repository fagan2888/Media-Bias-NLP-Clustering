NASHUA, N.H.—New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie criticized President Obama during a speech today, calling him a “weak president who has weakened our country.”

“We can no longer afford to have weakness in the Oval Office,” said Christie. “We need to have strength and clarity and hard truths.”

Christie said that one of the hard truths that needs to be discussed are entitlement programs.

“Let me ask you this: Why would I talk about those things if they weren’t true? There is no political advantage to talking about those issues. The reason you talk about them is because you really want to make suggestions that will help to solve the problems that our country confronts.”

Christie suggested lowering taxes on “corporations and individuals” to spur economic growth.

Christie said he feels Americans are worried for their country because of the “absolutely feckless leadership by this president.”

“All he cares [about] now, he’s got his legacy and his library, the two L’s,” said Christie. “The two L’s for Barack Obama, that’s all that’s left: legacy and library.”

“I’m a Republican in New Jersey,” says @GovChristie. “Come try that for a few days.”

Christie said that Obama’s latest mistake was his decision to remove Cuba from the state sponsors of terrorism list, calling it a “national disgrace.”

“If Cuba wants normalized relations with the United States, they should act like a civilized country,” said Christie.

“You know, some people say I’m too blunt, I’m too direct, too straightforward. I think we could use a little bit of that in Washington, D.C.,” said Christie. “You might not always agree with every word that comes out of my mouth, but I will guarantee you one thing: you will never have to wonder what I’m thinking.”

Asked by an audience member about his brash attitude, Christie laughed.

“I’m a Republican in New Jersey,” said Christie. “Come try that for a few days.”

Christie hinted at a potential presidential run by joking that he’d be back in New Hampshire soon.
