General manager Jason Licht and coach Lovie Smith want players who truly love the game.\n\nAnd it seems Conte does, perhaps even more than life itself. After all, he\u2019s continuing to play despite a 2014 season that was as physically taxing on him as any he ever played.\n\nIn addition to the concussions, Conte also sustained injuries last year to his right shoulder, his left shoulder, his right shoulder again, his right eye and his back.\n\nDespite all that, Conte played in 12 games last year, all starts. That toughness is no doubt another thing made him attractive to the Bucs. It has certainly impressed his teammates.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always liked Chris because he\u2019s a hard-nosed guy,\u2019\u2019 said DT Henry Melton, a former teammate of Conte\u2019s with the Bears who signed with the Bucs on the same day as Conte two weeks ago.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s not going to shy away from contact. And he\u2019s a playmaker. He\u2019s been starting ever since (he came to the league) and he\u2019s a great pickup for the Bucs.\u2019\u2019\n\n*****\n\nFamiliar faces\n\nConte says he doesn\u2019t feel like a stranger walking into the Bucs locker room. And it\u2019s not just because Melton walked into that locker room right along with him.\n\nConte grew up with CB Alterraun Verner and spent the first two years of his career working for former Bears and current Bucs secondary coach Gill Byrd.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why it\u2019s almost a dream come true to come and play for these guys,\u2019\u2019 Conte said. \u201cJust the relationships that I have with Coach Smith, with Coach Byrd, it\u2019s something that you don\u2019t come across every day.\n\n\u201cThese are special people that you don\u2019t come across every day and they make you want to play harder for them. So, I knew that once they left Chicago I was going to do everything I could to play for them again.\u2019\u2019\n\n*****\n\nGetting to know you\n\nThe Bucs spent last Monday visiting with former Oregon QB Marcus Mariota. One of the things Licht was impressed by the most was Mariota\u2019s humility.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe in my years in the NFL I\u2019ve seen a player who\u2019s had as much success as he\u2019s had be as humble as he was,\u2019\u2019 Licht said of the 2014 Heisman Trophy winner.\n\nrcummings@tampatrib.com\n\n(813) 259-7979\n\nTwitter: @RCummingsTBO", "article_metadata": {"taboola-pub-time": "Sat, 21 Mar 2015 14:20:35 -0400", "Description": "Fearful that continuing to play football might one day reduce his quality of life or, even worse, shorten it by a few years, former San Francisco 49ers LB Chris Borland retired last week at age 24 after just one NFL season.", "og": {"site_name": "TBO.com", "description": "Fearful that continuing to play football might one day reduce his quality of life or, even worse, shorten it by a few years, former San Francisco 49ers LB Chris Borland retired last week at age 24 after just one NFL season.", "title": "Bucs Beat: Conte says playing football worth the risk", "url": "http://www.tbo.com/sports/bucs/bucs-beat-conte-says-playing-football-worth-the-risk-20150321/", "image": {"width": 1000, "identifier": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20150321/ARTICLE/150329843/AR/0/AR-150329843.jpg", "height": 674}, "updated_time": "2015-03-21T14:20:00Z-04", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "tbo.com", "description": "Fearful that continuing to play football might one day reduce his quality of life or, even worse, shorten it by a few years, former San Francisco 49ers LB Chris Borland retired last week at age 24 after just one NFL season.", "title": "Bucs Beat: Conte says playing football worth the risk", "image": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20150321/ARTICLE/150329843/AR/0/AR-150329843.jpg", "site": "@TBOcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 522234267826834}, "msvalidate.01": "29E67031F86E7FB6DF9823924E21B8B4", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/tbocom", "published_time": "2015-03-21T14:20:35Z-04", "modified_time": "2015-03-21T14:20:00Z-04"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd7fcd\"", "article_summary": "In addition to the concussions, Conte also sustained injuries last year to his right shoulder, his left shoulder, his right shoulder again, his right eye and his back.\nThat passion for the game is surely one of the traits that made Conte so attractive to the Bucs.\n\u201cThat\u2019s why it\u2019s almost a dream come true to come and play for these guys,\u2019\u2019 Conte said.\n\u201cI\u2019d rather have the experience of playing in the NFL and die 10 to 15 years earlier than not play in the NFL and have a long life,\u201d Conte told Chicago radio station WBBM-AM.\nConte grew up with CB Alterraun Verner and spent the first two years of his career working for former Bears and current Bucs secondary coach Gill Byrd."}
