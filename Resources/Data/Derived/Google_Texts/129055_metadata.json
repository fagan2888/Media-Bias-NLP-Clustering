Unroll your mats and let\u2019s get started. Does anyone know if Dr. Carson left or if he\u2019s just in the bathroom?\n\nJOHN KASICH : Oh, boy, you know, I really don\u2019t know. I\u2019ll go check!\n\nDONALD TRUMP : Let him go. He\u2019s a loser.\n\nKELLY : Well, I\u2019d rather . . .\n\nTRUMP : What, you don\u2019t want to practice yoga with just me and Ted and Marco?\n\nKELLY : [Silence]\n\nKASICH : Well, I think it would just be a real shame for Ben to miss out on this. I\u2019ll look for him. But don\u2019t worry\u2014I\u2019ll be back soon. I\u2019ve been here for a long, long time, and I\u2019m not leaving now!\n\nKELLY : All right . . .\n\nTRUMP : By the way, Megyn, you are looking great today. Just terrific. Those yoga pants fit you just great. As do mine. As you can see, there is no problem here.\n\nKELLY : Excuse me?\n\nTRUMP : I guarantee you there\u2019s no problem. I guarantee. See?\n\nKELLY : O.K., gross. Everyone find a comfortable seated position, maybe on a folded blanket. Get your sitz bones really planted on the ground. Senator Cruz, what are you doing?\n\nTED CRUZ : My most comfortable seated position is standing. Standing up for the Constitution. My sitz bones are planted on my thigh bones of righteousness, and my thigh bones are planted on my knee bones of freedom, and my knee bones are planted on my shin bones of the Second Amendment, and my shin bones are planted on my ankle bones of repealing Obamacare, and my ankle bones are planted on my foot bones of virtuous unpopularity, and my foot bones are planted on Hillary Clinton\u2019s throat.\n\nTRUMP : Now you see, Megyn, if I had told him to sit down, he would have sat down. It\u2019s not your fault\u2014you look great\u2014but you\u2019re not a leader. If I told him to drop to his knees, he\u2019d be on his knees. Look, I\u2019m a leader. I\u2019ve told a huge number of people\u2014billions of people\u2014to drop to their knees and they have. And it was beautiful. Like with Mitt. I told him to drop to his knees, and he dropped to his knees.\n\nKELLY : Actually, Mr. Trump, you never did that. And the implication of what you\u2019re saying is kind of sexual and very weird.\n\nTRUMP : Well, maybe I did or maybe I didn\u2019t, but he would have. And millions of others have. Ninety-eight per cent of people have. And I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about with the sexual. There\u2019s no problem, I guarantee.\n\nCRUZ : Can I just say that there is nothing about you, Donald, that makes me want to drop to my knees? And let me add that there is only one man whom a God-fearing American would ever, ever bend his knee to, and that man is Ayn Rand.\n\nKELLY : Ayn Rand was a woman.\n\nMARCO RUBIO : Actually, we made her an honorary. Right, fellas?\n\nTRUMP : Absolutely. Terrific guy. And just gorgeous.\n\nKELLY : All right, since we\u2019re on the topic, let\u2019s just move onto our hands and knees.\n\nTRUMP : See?\n\nKELLY : Shut up, Mr. Trump. Now as we transition into downward dog, really dig your toes into the mat and spread those fingers wide.\n\nRUBIO : [Stifles a laugh.]\n\nKELLY : Senator Rubio, would you like to weigh in?\n\nRUBIO : Oh, nothing, just with the fingers . . . I\u2019d actually just like to say something that I think has been overlooked all too often in these classes.\n\nKELLY : Go ahead.\n\nRUBIO : I think we need to acknowledge that President Obama is really good at the cobra pose and that I am really good at warrior two.\n\nCRUZ : If I could just interject, since I was mentioned.\n\nKELLY : You weren\u2019t, actually. Stand by.\n\nCRUZ : I\u2019m really good at warrior one.\n\nKELLY : I said stand by.\n\nRUBIO : Nobody likes you, Ted, and, anyway, it\u2019s that kind of pettiness that makes us overlook the fact, as happens all too often in these classes, that President Obama is really good at the cobra pose, and I am really good at warrior two.\n\nTRUMP : Oh, there goes little Marco, repeating himself. Maybe wittle Marco needs a water break? Or maybe wittle Marco needs to do a wittle child\u2019s pose. A wittle child\u2019s pose while the rest of us do warrior?\n\nRUBIO : There he goes again, with the personal attacks! I think the voters know how important hydration is, and I will not apologize for staying properly hydrated. Nor will I apologize for saying the thing that gets overlooked all too often in these classes, which is that President Obama is really good at the cobra pose and I am really good at warrior two.\n\nTRUMP : Give me a break. You\u2019re very short. Your hair never moves. Your mother looks like Santa Claus. Your dog has heartworms. You prefer creamy peanut butter. You own a betta fish. Give me a break, little Marco.\n\nCRUZ : Breathe, Donald, breathe! I know it\u2019s hard, but attention to the breath is the center of any practice.\n\nKELLY : Everyone, please, stand by.\n\nCRUZ : I\u2019m already standing.\n\nKELLY : Maybe you should have some water, Senator Rubio. You\u2019re looking a little overheated. In fact, I think everyone could use a little cooldown.\n\nKASICH : Oh, boy! Happy baby? Happy baby\u2019s my favorite!\n\nKELLY : I didn\u2019t realize you were back.\n\nKASICH : I\u2019ve been here the whole time. But I don\u2019t think Ben is coming back.\n\nKELLY : That\u2019s probably for the best. I was worried that his heart might stop beating during the meditation.\n\nKASICH : Oh, boy, that would really be something! You know, I have a lot of experience with happy baby. Much more than anyone else in this studio. If I could, Megyn, I would just love to lead the group in happy baby.
