The government gets to provide contraceptive coverage to employees of religious nonprofits. Those religious objectors won't face heavy fines for refusing to provide coverage. And a potentially deadlocked Supreme Court won't have to settle a contentious battle pitting religious freedom against the Affordable Care Act's birth-control mandate.

All sides appeared to come away with something — but not without giving up something — after the Supreme Court's unexpected and unanimous order Monday, sending the parties back to the lower courts to hammer out a compromise that they told the justices was possible.

Mark Rienzi, senior counsel for the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, said the court's announcement validates the religious nonprofits' argument that the government could provide contraceptive access through a less restrictive means than its current accommodation that resulted in dozens of lawsuits. The Becket Fund represents the Little Sisters of the Poor, a high-profile petitioner in a case consolidating several appeals and identified as Zubik v. Burwell.

"From our point of view, this decision is a win for religious liberty and confirmation of what we've been saying all along," Rienzi said.

However, Robert Tuttle, a professor of law and religion at George Washington University Law School, noted that the government is also a winner because it can still ensure contraceptive coverage is available to employees of religious nonprofits.

“If what the (petitioners) objected to was the government using their insurance companies to provide contraceptives to their employees and their dependents, they lost,” he said, calling the fallout from the opinion "messy."
