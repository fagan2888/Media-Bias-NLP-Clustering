Those other states include Tennessee, Georgia, Maryland and New York.\n\nThe Post reported that Seedco\u2019s Obamacare contract in Tennessee is worth $1.2 million.\n\nBrian Robinson, spokesman for the New York-based nonprofit, told Tennessee Watchdog that Seedco doesn\u2019t carry out all that work by itself \u2014 it also subcontracts some of that work to other agencies throughout the state.\n\nRobinson said Seedco fully complies with Tennessee\u2019s registration process for navigators.\n\nTennessee Watchdog asked Robinson if that registration process includes criminal background checks, as the Tennessee Department of Commerce and Insurance requires.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe so, but I\u2019m not positive. But I can tell you that we are abiding by all of the contracts that we need to be,\u201d Robinson said.\n\nAs navigators, those employees have access to other individuals\u2019 private medical and financial information.\n\nThat\u2019s not the only work Seedco does in Tennessee, however.\n\nSeedco\u2019s subcontracting practices while distributing Temporary Assistance for Needy Families benefits in Memphis recently caught the attention of State Comptroller Justin Wilson.\n\nAs Tennessee Watchdog previously reported, certain Memphis residents participating in TANF falsified paperwork and wrongly received almost $30,000 in taxpayer money through a Seedco subcontractor.\n\nThe director for that now former subcontractor, the Union City-based Tennessee Community Services Agency, told Tennessee Watchdog that Seedco chose his agency even though he didn\u2019t have enough employees to monitor possible fraud.\n\nMcWherter also told Tennessee Watchdog his agency and others rewarded with a subcontract for this work didn\u2019t participate in competitive bidding to determine the most qualified vendor.\n\nAs for how Seedco chooses subcontractors in Tennessee to carry out Obamacare, Robinson said the nonprofit has upped its standards, but the process still isn\u2019t based on competitive bidding.\n\n\u201cThere is a regional aspect, and there are a number of other factors, all based on the subcontractor\u2019s reputation and capacity to do the work necessary,\u201d Robinson said.\n\nAs for the allegations in New York, Robinson said it was one instance and the employees involved are no longer affiliated with the nonprofit.\n\nColumnist Michelle Malkin detailed other questionable acts by Seedco.\n\nSeedco Mid-South Senior Vice President Lisa Pote introduced U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius at an event to promote Obamacare in Memphis this month.\n\nContact Christopher Butler at chris@tennesseewatchdog.org.\n\nGet regular Tennessee Watchdog updates through our Facebook or Twitter accounts\n\nLike Watchdog.org?
