Dramatically, it reunites him with original members of a once hot band he led in Connecticut in the 1990s that, quite remarkably, has been reborn after 20 years of silence.\n\nBowler said that the new reunion with his old bandmates has been as musically smooth as it has been emotionally satisfying.\n\nFirst let\u2019s look at the story of the recording and the moving reunion of Bowler and his buddies, his onetime prot\u00e9g\u00e9s of yesterday who are now once again his collaborators of today. It\u2019s especially dramatic because the resurrection of long out-of-business jazz bands has to be regarded as at least a mini-miracle of sorts. Since the end of the Big Band Era and the ascent and suffocating commercial domination of rock, jazz bands routinely have had to struggle just to survive. Many often meet untimely ends, with absolutely no hope of redemption and life after death. Rarely, if ever, are defunct, non-brand name jazz bands like Pocket Jungle brought back to life, especially 20 years after their official demise.\n\nA most welcome exception to the merciless mortality rates for working jazz groups, Bowler\u2019s band is happily revived and swinging once again, back in the groove or pocket, as they say.\n\nOriginally, Bowler formed the band back in the 1990s as a kind of working/teaching tool for drummer William \u201cBeaver\u201d Bausch, who had sought him out as his mentor in order to learn first-hand how drummers connect on a deep level with bass players in a jazz setting. Bowler, who has worked hand-in-glove with many master drummers from Jeff \u201cTain\u201d Watts to Ralph Peterson and is a natural-born, famously empathetic teacher/scholar, was, perhaps, the most ideal mentor any young drummer like Bausch could possibly wish for.\n\n\"Every time I get together with this band after whatever amount of time, it comes together almost immediately. Within a few notes, we are all together. It's an extraordinary feeling.\"\n\nPhil Bowler\n\nLuckily, Bowler had just come off the road with Wynton Marsalis and was between longtime job commitments, although, typically, this one-man industry was still working with groups led by trumpeters Jon Faddis and Terence Blanchard. At that moment, however, he had the time and the inclination to lead a band of young players in their 20s, all of whom looked up to him as a mentor figure, a globe-trotting pro who regularly toured and recorded with jazz giants they idolized.\n\nInitially, the bass maestro formed a big ensemble version of Pocket Jungle, which rehearsed at the University of Bridgeport. These working sessions gave Bausch, Bowler\u2019s young drummer prot\u00e9g\u00e9, the opportunity to work with his mentor in a large band setting. Eventually, the ensemble got whittled down to Pocket Jungle\u2019s founding four, a quartet featuring Bowler on bass, Bausch on drums, guitarist Pete Smith and trumpeter Bill Dowling. Dowling later moved on, and has been replaced in the Pocket Jungle\u2019s brand new incarnation by the resourceful tenor saxophonist Paul Carlon.\n\nFor its debut disc on ZOHO Music, the now rejuvenated Pocket Jungle\u2019s lineup is beefed-up a bit with the addition of a special guest, percussionist Scott Latzky. His tablas bring an exotic flavoring to three of the album\u2019s nine spicy tracks that groove on a variety of genres, including Latin and swinging, straight-ahead jazz. It\u2019s all diverse, all in the pocket, tight-knit and interactive. Besides originals, the album\u2019s song list includes compositions by Steve Coleman, Bobby Hutcherson, Harvie S and one sizzling standard, \u201cOld Devil Moon.\u201d\n\nIn its original quartet form, the adventurous band had a brief but good run in the \u201990s, including performances in jazz festivals in Trumbull and Hartford. Schedules and commitments for band members changed, as they inevitably do, and the band, for all its early promise, closed up shop and remained quietly in limbo for two decades.\n\nIn 2013, however, Bausch, who has since forged a career all his own, decided that, as a loving tribute to Bowler, he, his colleagues and Bowler, their musical guru, friend and inspiration of many years ago, regroup and make a reunion album that would feature both old and newly written material. The whole concept of the album was sprung on Bowler as a surprise.\n\n\u201cIt was totally unexpected,\u201d Bowler said of when his one-time prot\u00e9g\u00e9s confronted him with the idea of going into the studio to make a tribute album to him with a reincarnation of Pocket Jungle.\n\nNotoriously, Bowler, for all his immodest amount of talent, is a most modest man -- someone who, over the years, has been adept at promoting jazz and the careers of fellow practitioners, while quite reluctant to ever blow his own horn about his own performing prowess.\n\n\u201cThey offered me money, which I didn\u2019t want, telling them, \u2018I\u2019d play with you guys anytime, anywhere for free,\u2019\u201d Bowler said by phone from his home in Newtown, describing how he first heard of the proposed new recording session. \u201cThey called it my album, naming me as the leader. I was in tears. Nobody ever did anything that beautiful for me.\u201d\n\nRecently, Pocket Jungle celebrated its new album\u2019s release with a session at New York\u2019s Zinc Bar, and is considering having a similar bash somewhere in a Connecticut venue.\n\n\"They called it my album, naming me as the leader. I was in tears. Nobody ever did anything that beautiful for me.\" - Phil Bowler\n\nAlthough he\u2019s traveled far, Connecticut is where Bowler grew up, went to school, and first established himself, working his way through Hartt School by frequently playing jobs in Hartford. As an undergrad who had come to love classical music as well as jazz, he did his polished arco and pizzicato thing everywhere and anywhere from dance dates to jazz gigs. Industrious even then, he loved jamming with such bandleaders as the jazz saxophonist Norman Gage and with the nationally noted drummer and Hartford native, Walter Bolden, on occasions when Bolden returned to play in his hometown.\n\nA classically trained jazz bassist with a degree from The Hartt School (one of his teachers at Hartt was the world-famous double bassist/pedagogue/composer Bertram Turetzky), Bowler has toured and/or recorded with Wynton Marsalis (including the Grammy Award-winning Think of One), Jackie McLean, Rahsaan Roland Kirk, Horace Silver, Terence Blanchard, and Donald Harrison, Max Roach, Slide Hampton, and Roy Haynes.\n\nThat\u2019s merely a small sampling of the legion of famous employers for whom Bowler was the first-call bassist of choice for numerous reasons. Among these are his big tone, unerring sense of time, soulful expressiveness, flexibility, and originality. These are just a few of the signature marks of the bassist\u2019s musical persona that embraces both the coolness of rational order, knowledge, precision, and gravitas with the sheer heat of bold, risk-taking adventurousness.\n\nNot one to dwell on past achievements, Bowler said that the new reunion with his old bandmates has been as musically smooth as it has been emotionally satisfying. \u201cEvery time I get together with this band after whatever amount of time, it comes together almost immediately. Within a few notes, we are all together. It\u2019s an extraordinary feeling,\u201d he said.\n\nBack in the day when the band was first formed, Bowler recalled, he was the bandleader but a democratic spirit prevailed among all members. \u201cThe way I like to run the band is that everyone is invested as opposed to the traditional relationship with the bandleader as boss,\u201d he said. \u201cI was gloriously a sideman in my own band at the same time that I was the leader. It was the greatest feeling in the world.\u201d\n\nAs for the band\u2019s name, Pocket Jungle, Bowler explained that the two words are metaphors for his philosophy of music. Jungle, he said, refers to the sense of challenge, adventure, and surprise that improvisers must feel and then convey to the listener with their art of the moment. Pocket refers not to just a groove -- say like a soulful Eddie Harris or Horace Silver groove -- but to a certain spot in the music where the listener feels at home.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re out in the elements of nature,\u201d he said, \u201cand whatever happens can happen, beyond your immediate thinking. Your senses are heightened.\u201d At the same time, Bowler hopes not to lose the audience, no matter how exploratory the music gets as it stretches out taking chances.\n\nWhat first set Bowler on his own personal jazz journey occurred as a teenager when he first heard his father\u2019s recordings of the original classic Miles Davis Quintet featuring Miles on trumpet and John Coltrane on tenor saxophone, powered by the rhythm section of pianist Red Garland, bassist Paul Chambers (one of Bowler\u2019s early superheroes), and drummer Philly Joe Jones. \u201cBack when I was a youngster, I loved Chuck Berry, Fats Domino, and Elvis Presley, and all the doo-wop groups,\u201d he said. \u201cRock and roll was my thing. I loved it.\u201d\n\nBut then came that life-shaping turning point when Bowler first heard Miles, an event whose enormous impact was facilitated by a succinct, yet enormously effective psychological ploy that his jazz-loving father played on him back then. \u201cI said to my dad, \u2018Who\u2019s that?\u2019 And he said to me, knowing full well what direction he was sending me in: \u2018Oh, no son, that\u2019s too heavy for you. You stick with the rock and roll stuff.\u2019 \u2026Miles was my first hero. Then I fell in love with Ray Brown\u2019s playing: the Bach of the bass, and of course, the playing of Paul Chambers (Bowler\u2019s touch, tone and phrasing have often been favorably compared with Chambers\u2019) and Charles Mingus. I have to pay tribute to my dad for using that psychological tactic on me, knowing full well what path he was sending me down with that comment.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s an ongoing path that may well open up in yet another surprising direction thanks to the rebirth of Pocket Jungle and the release of its new CD.\n\nDepending on its reception, of course, the new album comes with an implicit promise of more explorations to be made, more adventures to be had. All tempered, of course, by Bowler\u2019s simultaneous creation of that magical core groove, the pocket, that primal, soulful sense of home always being there for us no matter how far we travel or how deep we go into the jungle.\n\nCelebrating Three Kings Day\n\nPianist David \u201cGoya\u201d Gonzalez and The Latin Jazz Experience celebrate Three Kings Day at 7:00 pm on January 9 in the auditorium of First Church of Christ Congregational at 12 South Main Street in West Hartford.\n\nA Hartford native, Gonzalez has performed with Orquesta Pueblo and Los Hermanos Moreno and artists ranging from saxophonist Jimmy Greene to guitarist Daniel Salazar. The band director is joined by two seasoned performers and fellow musical wise men, drummer/percussionist Idalberto Perdomo and Edilio Bermudez, a composer, arranger, teacher, violinist and bassist.\n\nA native of Cuba, Perdomo has appeared with such celebrated musicians as Karl Perazzo from the Carlos Santana Band, and percussionist Armando Peraza. A native of Venezuela, Bermudez has toured with singer Julio Iglesias and performed with many renowned figures including singer Celia Cruz and pianist Danilo Perez.\n\nGonzalez has described his band\u2019s vibrant style as \u201ca union of musical forces that delivers an exploration of Latin jazz by fusing the indigenous music of Puerto Rico, salsa and a unique and fresh approach that flirts with fusion.\u201d\n\nA $10.00 donation is suggested.
