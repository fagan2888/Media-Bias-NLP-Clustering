Q: Does day-old, leftover kale salad have less nutritional value than fresher kale?

A: Technically, yes. There is a gradual loss in nutrient content in any fresh fruit or vegetable from the moment it is picked. But unless you are growing your own kale or buying it at the farmers’ market, it has most likely spent days in transit and on display. The additional day in your crisper will make virtually no difference.

And kale is quite hardy. While we tend to treat it as a salad green, it is a cruciferous vegetable like brussels sprouts, cauliflower and broccoli. So you may notice it can be stored far longer than lettuce or spinach.

Whether the leftover kale is raw or cooked, it is important to keep it refrigerated. One study found that after six days of refrigeration, leafy vegetables lost only 10 percent of their vitamin C content, compared with 20 percent in just two days at room temperature.

“I definitely would hope that doesn’t deter someone from eating the kale salad,” said Jackie Armstrong, a nutritionist at Stanford University. “It’s still packed with nutrition.”
