Dr. Berg presented the concept, vision and implementation of Redirect Health, a health care solution built on an entirely new business model that can save businesses hundreds of thousands of dollars \u2013 or more \u2013 on medical costs each year while also increasing the quality and convenience of health care.\n\n\u201cI have coached more than 6,000 entrepreneurs over the course of my 40-year career, but only a small handful have shown the promise, passion and smarts that David displays,\u201d said Sullivan. \u201cHe is unrelenting in his commitment to change America\u2019s health care landscape as we know it, and his business is unlike anything the industry has ever seen.\u201d\n\nGame Changer is an event designed to help successful business people reach the next phase of their careers. Sullivan handpicked Dr. Berg and three other panelists to share details of their game-changing businesses. In addition, Sullivan led the group through Strategic Coach\u2019s signature thinking process, which is designed to create lasting breakthroughs and concrete action steps to plan for a bigger future.\n\n\u201cDan\u2019s insights and tough questions over the years helped us form a company we believe has the potential to help any employer to get healthcare that works so well, and so inexpensively, that they won\u2019t think twice about providing free healthcare to their employees because of the free market competitive advantage it gives them,\u201d said Berg. \u201cBy systematically designing out the irritating and annoying waste, headaches and runaway costs of traditional health care, companies can transform health care from a burden into an advantage they can use to grow their companies.\u201d\n\nFounded in 2013 by Dr. Berg and Paul Johnson, former Phoenix City Councilman and Mayor turned business leader and developer, Redirect Health provides employers an alternative to traditional health care insurance, meeting all Minimum Essential Coverage requirements stipulated in the Affordable Care Act while also addressing the vast majority of health care needs that people will encounter. The company quickly identifies the most effective and cost-efficient routes to treat patients, enabling employers to cut health care costs significantly and reinvest the savings back into their business.\n\nThe nearly $150,000 in profits from Game Changer were donated to American Dream U, an organization created by Strategic Coach participant Phil Randazzo to assist military members in their transition into their dream jobs or business ownership with the help of the world\u2019s best entrepreneurs.\n\nAbout Redirect Health\n\nFounded in 2013, Redirect Health provides entrepreneurial businesses with affordable healthcare plans that comply with the Affordable Care Act, reduce administration costs associated with many health insurance plans, and enhance the employee\u2019s healthcare experience.
