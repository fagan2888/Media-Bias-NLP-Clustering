The White House maintains that sanctions will bankrupt those in Putin\u2019s inner circle, putting economic pressure on the oligarchs who give the Russian leader power.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t, if I were you, invest in Russian equities right now, unless you\u2019re going short,\u201d then White House press secretary Jay Carney said in March.\n\nThe strategy worked for a while; in the wake of the Ukraine crisis, the Russian stock market tanked and foreign investment in Russia dried up.\n\nHowever, as tensions in Ukraine have eased, the Russian economy has made a quiet comeback. It\u2019s far from the lofty heights it reached before the crisis. However, since bottoming out in May, the RTS (Russian Trading System) Index has risen 33 percent, replacing much of the loss caused in the early days of the crisis.\n\nAnd some of the best performers are the countries that the White House thought would be most impacted by sanctions. For instance, the Russian energy giant Rosneft has gone up 17 percent since Obama placed sanctions on Igor Sechin, its CEO. Another energy company, Novatek, has risen 37 percent since Treasury placed sanctions on its CEO, Gennady Timchenko. Gazprom, the state-owned energy giants, is up 30 percent since March, and 10 percent on the year.\n\nRelated: Does Putin Want to Carve Up Ukraine and Take the Spoils?\n\nThe market rally might be the reason for many of the conciliatory gestures Putin has made in recent weeks. He\u2019s asked the Russian government to withdraw authorization that would have allowed Russian troops to operate in Ukraine. He\u2019s also expressed support for the outcome of the Ukrainian presidential elections held last month.\n\nHowever, these gestures do not mean that Putin is abandoning his regional ambitions. What\u2019s happening in Ukraine is a replay of what happened after Russian invaded Georgia in 2008.\n\nDuring that crisis, Russia provoked Georgian troops into engaging them, giving them a reason to invade. They quickly pushed back overmatched Georgian forcers, and occupied an area of the country where Russian speakers lived. He then threatened to invade deeper into the country, until withdrawing Russian troops while keeping an occupation force in northern Georgia, along the Russian border.\n\nRelated: Russia's Provocative New Act of Aggression in Ukraine\n\nThe same scenario is playing out in Ukraine. Russia trumped up a reason to enter Crimea. It occupied the peninsula and threatened to invade the mainland. Under international and economic pressure, it backed off while continuing to occupy Ukraine.\n\nAccording to Christian Whiton, a former Bush administration State Department senior advisor, Putin isn\u2019t retreating in Ukraine.\n\n\u201cPutin has what he wants in Ukraine\u2014possession of Crimea and the ability to cause political crisis in the rest of Ukraine\u2014and is now relaxing to consolidate his gains,\u201d he said.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "President Obama\u2019s strategy to bankrupt Russia isn\u2019t working.", "title": "Obama\u2019s Strategy to Bankrupt Russia Isn\u2019t Working", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/06/26/Obama-s-Strategy-Bankrupt-Russia-Isn-t-Working", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/04282014_Russia_Bank_Run.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/06/26/Obama-s-Strategy-Bankrupt-Russia-Isn-t-Working", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/04282014_Russia_Bank_Run.jpg", "creator": "@davidcfrancis", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "President Obama\u2019s strategy to bankrupt Russia isn\u2019t working.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "The strategy worked for a while; in the wake of the Ukraine crisis, the Russian stock market tanked and foreign investment in Russia dried up.\nHe then threatened to invade deeper into the country, until withdrawing Russian troops while keeping an occupation force in northern Georgia, along the Russian border.\nDuring that crisis, Russia provoked Georgian troops into engaging them, giving them a reason to invade.\nHe\u2019s asked the Russian government to withdraw authorization that would have allowed Russian troops to operate in Ukraine.\nRelated: Putin's Oligarchs Are Key to War and Peace in UkraineKerry\u2019s economic threat is part of the Obama administration\u2019s broader strategy to check the ambitions of Russia in Ukraine."}
