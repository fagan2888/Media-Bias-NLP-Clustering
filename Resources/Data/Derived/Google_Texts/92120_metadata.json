Tom Rice, R-S.C., is sponsoring a resolution that would compel the House to take President Barack Obama to court over his \u201cfailure to faithfully execute the laws,\u201d should it be adopted.\n\nThe resolution points to Article II, Section 3 of the Constitution, which defines the president\u2019s responsibilities, and charges that Obama and his administration have abused executive power and failed to execute the laws of the United States faithfully, according to The Weekly Standard.\n\n\u201c[I]t is therefore necessary and appropriate for Congress to turn to the courts to ensure the faithful execution of the laws as required by the Constitution,\u201d states the resolution.\n\nMichelle Obama hits hubby with death glare seen around the world\n\n\u201cPresident Obama has adopted a practice of picking and choosing which laws he wants to enforce,\u201d Rice wrote in a letter to House members asking them to co-sponsor this resolution, The Weekly Standard reported.\n\n\u201cIn most cases, his laws of choice conveniently coincide with his administration\u2019s political agenda,\u201d Rice continued. \u201cOur Founding Fathers created the Executive Branch to implement and enforce the laws written by Congress and vested this power in the President. However, President Obama has chosen to ignore some of the laws written by Congress and implemented by preceding Presidents.\u201d\n\nIn the letter, Rice highlighted four instances in which Obama may have overstepped his authority:\n\n1. President Obama recently announced an \u201cadministrative fix\u201d in regard to cancelled healthcare plans due to Obamacare. Of course he plans to provide a \u201cfix\u201d which will substantially alter his signature legislation without involving Congress. 2. Over the summer, President Obama\u2019s Administration announced a one-year delay in Obamacare\u2019s employer mandate without involving Congress. 3. Last year, President Obama\u2019s Administration granted temporary status to illegal immigrants who entered the United States as children without involving Congress. 4. In June 2012, President Obama\u2019s Administrative provided a waiver initiative for the welfare work requirement under TANF without involving Congress.\n\nThere are currently 29 members of Congress co-sponsoring the resolution, to include three from Florida: Bachmann (MN-06), Bridenstine (OK-01), Chaffetz (UT-03), J. Duncan (SC-03), DeSantis (FL-06), Franks (AZ-08), Gowdy (SC-04), Harris (MD-01), Lamborn (CO-05), LaMalfa (CA-01), Marino (PA-10), McClintock (CA-04), Meadows (NC-11), Nunnelee (MS-01), Pittenger (NC-09), Posey (FL-08), Tom Price (GA-06), Ribble (WI-08), Salmon (AZ-05), Sanford (SC-01), Schweikert (AZ-06), Stewart (UT-02), Stockman (TX-36), Walberg (MI-07), Weber (TX-14), Wenstrup (OH-02), Williams (TX-25), Joe Wilson (SC-02), and Yoho (FL-03).\n\nRead the full text from Rep.
