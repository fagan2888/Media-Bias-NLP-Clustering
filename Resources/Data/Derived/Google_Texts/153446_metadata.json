He clicked send and said he thought nothing more of it until late February of this year.\n\n\u201cWhite House Senior Analyst and Projects Manager Max Sgro called my cell phone,\u201d said Bell excitedly. \u201cHe told me how I was a big supporter of the president in the area and they were reaching out to supporters to come to Columbia for his visit to South Carolina. They asked me if I wanted to see the president speak.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course, I said I did,\u201d Bell said.\n\nThe 15-year-old student was allowed one guest to accompany him. He picked his mother, Stacy.\n\n\u201cMy mom loves the president, and I knew she\u2019d love the opportunity to meet him,\u201d Bell said. \u201cI knew immediately I wanted to take my mom.\u201d\n\nThe pair made the trip to Columbia on March 6.\n\n\u201cWe had to be there at 10:15 a.m. to go through the line and get tickets,\u201d Bell said. \u201cAfter that, we went into another line. We got in about 11:25 a.m. and sat in the regular section of seats.\u201d\n\nBell and his mother overheard a conversation about wristbands nearby.\n\n\u201cThey were talking about our green wristbands,\u201d Bell said. \u201cAnd they told us those wristbands gave us reserved seating \u2018over there.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe pair were ushered to a section of seats where individual names were posted on the back of each one.\n\n\u201cIt had the White House emblem and everything,\u201d Bell said.\n\nSitting in the same section were former state Superintendent of Education Inez Tenenbaum, U.S. House Minority Whip James Clyburn, lieutenant governor candidate Bakari Sellers and other state officials.\n\n\u201cIt was really interesting and fun to experience a social setting with some of the dignitaries at both the U.S. and state levels of government,\u201d Bell said.\n\nNot long after he and his mother were seated, Bell said he heard the president\u2019s voice.\n\n\u201cI could hear him talking, and we were led through this curtain to where we could get our picture made with him,\u201d Bell said. \u201cHe had an assistant who had been telling him our names, so he greeted us individually with our names. That was really special.\u201d\n\nBell said he hasn\u2019t received the picture quite yet.\n\n\u201cThey said it would take a few weeks, and believe me, I\u2019m anxiously awaiting that picture,\u201d Bell said.\n\nThe program included remarks from Clyburn and the president, who spoke for about 10 to 15 minutes, Bell said.\n\n\u201cThen, he had an Open Town Hall for about an hour,\u201d Bell said. \u201cAnd then he came down and shook everyone\u2019s hands. And he remembered our names then.\u201d\n\nStacy Bell said her son\u2019s fascination with Obama was nothing new to her or husband Thomas. Neither was it to the couple\u2019s other children, Stacilyn, Thomas, Imani or Jabril.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s always been very interested in politics,\u201d Stacy Bell said. \u201cIt\u2019s always been something that has interested him.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe normal kid in junior high or high school is going home and seeing what\u2019s on BET or MTV or YouTube, and when I get home, I turn on CSPAN, CNN, Fox News or MSNBC,\u201d Bell said. \u201cI want to have that insight on world news and the politics of today. There are so many issues that involve all Americans and I want to know about them.\u201d\n\nBell\u2019s interest in politics and action extend to his extracurricular activities, which include the Future Business Leaders of America, FFA and the Beta Club. He is the Manning High School student body treasurer and a council member with the Fellowship of Christian Athletes. The vice-president of the local FBLA, he was named over the weekend as president for the state chapter.\n\nOutside of school, he is a member of the Manning Youth Council and Clarendon County Youth Leadership.\n\n\u201cI just like being involved,\u201d Bell said. \u201cIt never gets boring.\u201d\n\nUPDATE: Quadri Bell\u2019s picture with President Obama", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Manning Live", "description": "Manning High School sophomore Quadri Bell had no idea that a simple letter he wrote in January 2014 would lead to his meeting President Barack Obama a little more than a year later. \u201cI started out \u2026", "title": "MHS sophomore meets president in Columbia", "url": "http://manninglive.com/2015/03/28/mhs-sophomore-meets-president-in-columbia/", "image": "http://manninglive.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/quadri-bell2-225x300.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "article": {"published_time": "2015-03-28T22:08:13+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-03-30T21:51:39+00:00"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://manninglive.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/quadri-bell2-225x300.jpg?w=1400", "card": "summary_large_image"}}, "article_summary": "MHS sophomore meets president in ColumbiaLast Updated: March 30, 2015 at 5:51 pmManning High School sophomore Quadri Bell had no idea that a simple letter he wrote in January 2014 would lead to his meeting President Barack Obama a little more than a year later.\n\u201cThey said it would take a few weeks, and believe me, I\u2019m anxiously awaiting that picture,\u201d Bell said.\nHe is the Manning High School student body treasurer and a council member with the Fellowship of Christian Athletes.\n\u201cThey were talking about our green wristbands,\u201d Bell said.\nThey asked me if I wanted to see the president speak.\u201d\u201cOf course, I said I did,\u201d Bell said."}
