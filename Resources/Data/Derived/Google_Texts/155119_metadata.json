Kelly Ayotte, R-N.H., last week would do. Ayotte\u2019s bill is an insult to New Hampshire women and women across the country. They would be wise to read the fine print and see it for the empty promise it is.\n\nSen. Ayotte and the other anti-women\u2019s health politicians who introduced this bill have repeatedly voted to take away insurance coverage for contraception, defund health programs that provide family planning services and deny women access to birth control.\n\nTheir records demonstrate clearly that they aren\u2019t truly interested in expanding women\u2019s access to contraception and this new bill that proclaims to expand access to birth control would actually harm women\u2019s access to contraceptive care and cost women more money.\n\nPlanned Parenthood opposes this bill because it will ultimately make birth control less accessible and less affordable, rather than make it available to more women who need it. As a leading women\u2019s reproductive health provider in New Hampshire, serving nearly 15,000 patients each year, we know firsthand that 1 in 3 women has struggled to afford birth control at some point in her life.\n\nIn Ayotte\u2019s bill, \u201cover-the-counter\u201d birth control actually means \u201cout-of-pocket\u201d costs for birth control. This legislation would erase the gains we\u2019ve made to make birth control more accessible, including the no-cost-sharing insurance coverage requirement provisions in the Affordable Care Act.\n\nWhat\u2019s even worse is that the bill does not protect insurance coverage for birth control once its available over-the-counter, eliminating the groundbreaking no-copay birth control benefit in the Affordable Care Act that has expanded access to birth control for over 144,000 New Hampshire women.\n\nIn 2013, the average American woman saved $269 in out-of-pocket costs because of this ACA benefit. This amounts to more than $37 million back in the pockets New Hampshire women, savings that Ayotte is all too willing return to employers and insurance companies at the expense of hard-working women.\n\nThis is the very opposite of expanding access to birth control.\n\nIn reality, Ayotte\u2019s bill would make women pay twice for their birth control \u2013 first they\u2019ll pay for insurance coverage that includes birth control coverage, and then they\u2019ll pay out of pocket for it, too.\n\nAyotte also misleads New Hampshire women by quoting the opinion of the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) to imply that these trusted medical experts support her legislation.\n\nIn fact, ACOG actively opposes Ayotte\u2019s proposal, stating that \u201cthis bill would actually make more women have to pay for their birth control, and for some women, the cost would be prohibitive.\u201d\n\nACOG also points to the significant gains the ACA has made in increasing access to birth control for women, \u201cdecreasing unintended pregnancies, and allowing women to better plan their futures\u201d in warning that the bill would be a setback for women\u2019s health.\n\nAccessing birth control isn\u2019t a one-size-fits-all pursuit and some of the most effective forms of contraception, including IUDs and implants, cannot be available over-the-counter because they require the involvement of a trained health care provider.\n\nTruly increasing access to contraception requires a multi-faceted approach to meet the needs of all women throughout their reproductive lives. Making birth control available over the counter can be part of the solution, but not at the expense of the no-cost contraception provided by the ACA, something Ayotte wants to repeal.\n\nHer bill amounts to little more than lip service to an issue that is central to women\u2019s health and economic security. Women seeking access to affordable, accessible reproductive care deserve better than this misleading effort. New Hampshire women should be insulted.\n\nJennifer Frizzell is vice president of public policy for Planned Parenthood of Northern New England and the Planned Parenthood New Hampshire Action Fund.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"Description": "As the largest reproductive health care provider and advocate in the region, Planned Parenthood Northern", "Title": "Kelly Ayotte birth-control bill is an insult to NH women", "og": {"site_name": "Nashua Telegraph", "description": "As the largest reproductive health care provider and advocate in the region, Planned Parenthood Northern", "title": "Kelly Ayotte birth-control bill is an insult to NH women", "url": "http://www.nashuatelegraph.com/opinion/commentary/1064708-474/kelly-ayotte-birth-control-bill-is-an-insult.html", "image": "http://www.nashuatelegraph.com/csp/cms/sites/dt.common.streams.StreamServer.cls?STREAMOID=LLm18tJLg$gPtM1rVi24ms$daE2N3K4ZzOUsqbU5sYurKHx8upXoeQid62M5oIg9WCsjLu883Ygn4B49Lvm9bPe2QeMKQdVeZmXF$9l$4uCZ8QDXhaHEp3rvzXRJFdy0KqPHLoMevcTLo3h8xh70Y6N_U_CryOsw6FTOdKL_jpQ-&CONTENTTYPE=image/jpeg", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 205657706177641}, "storyId": 3100642, "google-site-verification": "yfybkHXEXC0sU_jUgXB3VOmw36w0XSDjbOnJTRc-WcI", "storyName": "OpFrizzell052915", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477afa6914bd0286fe5c70\"", "article_summary": "Ayotte\u2019s bill is an insult to New Hampshire women and women across the country.\nIn Ayotte\u2019s bill, \u201cover-the-counter\u201d birth control actually means \u201cout-of-pocket\u201d costs for birth control.\nAyotte also misleads New Hampshire women by quoting the opinion of the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) to imply that these trusted medical experts support her legislation.\nNew Hampshire women should be insulted.\nIn reality, Ayotte\u2019s bill would make women pay twice for their birth control \u2013 first they\u2019ll pay for insurance coverage that includes birth control coverage, and then they\u2019ll pay out of pocket for it, too."}
