[Associated Press]\n\nNEW YORK \u2014 The police killings of unarmed blacks in Ferguson, Mo., and elsewhere \u2014 and the investigations and tumultuous protests they inspired \u2014 was the top news story of 2014, according to the Associated Press' annual poll of U.S. editors and news directors.\n\nIn a year crowded with dramatic and often wrenching news developments around the world, the No. 2 story was the devastating outbreak of Ebola in West Africa, followed by the conflict in Iraq and Syria fueled by the brutal actions of Islamic State militants.\n\nThe voting was conducted before the announcement that the United States and Cuba were re-establishing diplomatic relations and Sony Pictures' decision to withdraw its film The Interview in the wake of computer hacking and threats.\n\nLast year's top story was the glitch-plagued rollout of President Barack Obama's health care overhaul, followed by the Boston Marathon bombing. The continuing saga of \"Obamacare\" made this year's Top 10 as well, coming in fifth.\n\nThe first AP top-stories poll was conducted in 1936, when editors chose the abdication of Britain's King Edward VIII.\n\nHere are 2014's top 10 stories, in order:\n\n\n\n\n\nPolice wearing riot gear walk toward a man with his hands raised on Aug. 11, 2014, in Ferguson, Mo. On Aug. 9, a white police officer fatally shot Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year old, in the St. Louis suburb. \u2014 AP photo\n\nPOLICE KILLINGS: Some witnesses said 18-year-old Michael Brown had his hands up in surrender, others said he was making a charge. But there was no dispute he was unarmed and shot dead by a white police officer in Ferguson. In New York City, another unarmed black, Eric Garner, was killed after a white officer put him in a chokehold during an arrest for unauthorized cigarette sales. After grand juries opted not to indict the officers, protests erupted across the country, punctuated by chants of \"Hands up, don't shoot\" and \"I can't breathe.\" In both cases, federal officials launched investigations.\n\n\n\n\n\nNine-year-old Nowa Paye is taken to an ambulance after showing signs of the Ebola infection in the village of Freeman Reserve, about 30 miles north of Monrovia, Liberia on Sept. 30, 2014 \u2014 AP photo\n\nEBOLA OUTBREAK: The first wave of Ebola deaths, early in the year, attracted little notice. By March, the World Health Organization was monitoring the outbreak. By midsummer, it was the worst Ebola epidemic on record, with a death toll now approaching 7,000, mostly in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea. A Liberian man with the disease died at a Dallas hospital, followed by a few other cases involving U.S. health workers, sparking worries about the readiness of the U.S. health system.\n\n\n\n\n\nThick smoke and flames from an airstrike by the U.S.-led coalition rise in Kobani, Syria, as seen from a hilltop on the outskirts of Suruc, at the Turkey-Syria border, on Oct. 20, 2014. Kobani, also known as Ayn Arab, and its surrounding areas, has been under assault by extremists of the Islamic State group since mid-September and is being defended by Kurdish fighters. \u2014 AP photo\n\nISLAMIC STATE: Militant fighters from the Islamic State group startled the world with rapid, brutal seizures of territory in Iraq and Syria. The U.S. and its allies responded with air strikes, hoping that Iraqi and Kurdish forces on the ground could retake captured areas. Revulsion toward Islamic State intensified as it broadcast videos of its beheadings of several Western hostages.\n\n\n\n\n\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Ky., joined by his wife, former Labor Secretary Elaine Chao, celebrates with his supporters at an election night party in Louisville, Ky., on Nov. 4, 2014. McConnell won a sixth term in Washington, with his eyes on the larger prize of GOP control of the Senate. \u2014 AP photo\n\nU.S. ELECTIONS: For months, political oddsmakers sought to calculate if Republicans had a chance to gain control of the U.S. Senate. It turned out there was no suspense \u2014 the GOP won 54 of the Senate's 100 seats, expanded its already strong majority in the House of Representatives, and gained at the state level, where Republicans now hold 31 governorships.\n\n\n\n\n\nPeople wait to enter an Affordable Care Act enrollment event sponsored by Service Employees International Union-United Healthcare Workers West and Community Coalition, in Los Angeles on Nov. 15, 2014.

Criticism from Republicans in Congress was relentless, many GOP-governed states balked at participation, and opinion polls suggested most Americans remained skeptical about the program.\n\n\n\n\n\nA relative of Chinese passengers aboard Malaysia Airlines MH370 grieves on March 24, 2014, after being told of the latest news in Beijing, China. \u2014 AP photo\n\nMALAYSIA AIRLINES MYSTERY: En route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing, Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 disappeared on March 8 with 239 people on board. In the weeks that followed, aircraft, ships and searchers from two-dozen countries mobilized to look in vain for the wreckage on the Indian Ocean floor. To date, there's no consensus as to why the plane vanished.\n\n\n\n\n\nYoung detainees sleep in a holding cell on June 18, 2014, at a U.S. Customs and Border Protection processing facility in Brownsville,Texas. Immigration courts backlogged by years of staffing shortages and tougher enforcement face an even more daunting challenge since tens of thousands of Central Americans began arriving on the U.S. border. \u2014 AP photo\n\nIMMIGRATION: Frustrated by an impasse in Congress, President Obama took executive actions in November to curb deportations for many immigrants residing in the U.S. illegally. GOP leaders in the House and Senate pledged efforts to block the president's moves. Prospects for reform legislation were dimmed earlier in the year by the influx of unaccompanied Central American minors arriving at the U.S. border, causing shelter overloads and case backlogs.\n\n\n\n\n\nPro-Russian rebels ride on a tank near the town of Makeyevka, eastern Ukraine, on Aug. 23, 2014. Hundreds of Russian aid trucks returned home from rebel-held eastern Ukraine highlighting a dire need for long-term assistance to the region where homes and livelihoods have been destroyed by months of fighting. \u2014 AP photo\n\nTURMOIL IN UKRAINE: A sometimes bloody revolt that toppled President Viktor Yanukovych in February triggered a chain of events that continued to roil Ukraine as the year drew to a close. Russia, worried that Ukraine would tilt increasingly toward the West, annexed the Crimean peninsula in March and backed an armed separatist insurgency in coal-rich eastern regions of Ukraine. The U.S. and its allies responded with sanctions against Russia.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Rev. Robin Gorsline, left, marries Nicole Pries, second from left, and Lindsey Oliver, one of the first same-sex couples in Virginia to be married, on Oct. 6, 2014, outside a Richmond court building in Richmond, Va. The U.S. Supreme Court's order turning away appeals from five states seeking to prohibit same-sex marriage triggered a series of moves in affected states to clear the way for gay and lesbian unions. \u2014 AP photo\n\nGAY MARRIAGE: Due to a wave of federal court rulings, 19 more U.S. states began allowing same-sex marriages, raising the total to 35 states encompassing about 64 percent of the population. Given that one U.S. court of appeals bucked the trend by upholding state bans on gay marriage, there was widespread expectation that the U.S. Supreme Court will take up the issue and make a national ruling.\n\n\n\n\n\nVeterans Affairs Secretary Eric Shinseki speaks with the news media on Capitol Hill in Washington, on May 15, 2014, after testifying before the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee hearing to examine the state of Veterans Affairs health care. \u2014 AP photo\n\nVA SCANDAL: The Department of Veterans Affairs became embroiled in a nationwide scandal over allegations of misconduct and cover-ups.
