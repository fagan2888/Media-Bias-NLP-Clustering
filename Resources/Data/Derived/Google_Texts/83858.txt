Fox News’ Megyn Kelly tonight aired more unearthed video of Obamacare architect Jonathan Gruber saying that “the American voters are too stupid to understand the difference” on the language of the law.

Gruber had said last year that a “lack of transparency” and “the stupidity of the American voter” helped the law get passed. Gruber admitted today that was inappropriate and insisted it was just an off-the-cuff mistake.

Kelly teed up the new clip (a five-second soundbite during a speech Gruber gave last year) by saying he was explaining how Democrats “played with the language of the Obamacare law.”

She then played the video, in which Gruber was talking about getting the law passed, and then said, “The American voters are too stupid the understand the difference.”
