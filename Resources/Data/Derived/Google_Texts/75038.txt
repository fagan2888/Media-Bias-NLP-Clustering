JAKARTA, Indonesia—While public views about who won Indonesia’s presidential election debate looked split, the country’s major newspapers were pretty clear about who they thought emerged victorious: Joko Widodo.

“Jokowi Outshines Prabowo” read the headline in Koran Tempo, a tabloid that put Mr. Widodo, whose nickname is Jokowi, ahead of his rival, Prabowo Subianto. The newspaper invited three experts with backgrounds in law and public policy to judge each candidate’s performance.

According to their collective assessment, Mr. Subianto got a total score of 64 (out of a possible 90 points), while Mr. Widodo achieved 66.5.

Mr. Subianto, a former army special forces general, did better on communication style according to the three pundits, while Mr. Widodo put forth better ideas for future work programs.

Kompas, Indonesia’s biggest national newspaper, highlighted several key questions in the debate, including the candidates’ views on regional governance and human rights violations. The conservative broadsheet’s headline said “Debate Shows the Difference Between [the Two] Candidates.” But its reporting indicated that Jokowi had done a better job explaining his potential future programs.

In other papers, the debate came off more as a battle than display of ideas.

Words such as “stinging” and “weaving,” “jabs” and “victory” filled the English-language Jakarta Globe, a tabloid whose provocative cover stated that vice presidential candidate Jusuf Kalla drew “first blood.”

The Jakarta Post also fell back on the fighting analogy declaring the final score in the showdown between Mr. Widodo and Mr. Subianto, at 1-0 for Jokowi.

Even this paper called the debate a squaring off, though it pointed to no conclusive winner.

On Twitter, meanwhile, the candidates battled for mentions, with Mr. Widodo trumping Mr. Subianto by 28%, according to Provetic, a data analysis company.

That may be a better indicator of the demographic lining up behind Mr. Widodo than any real support for the candidate, with many analysts saying he did better than expected but didn’t score any knock-out punches. Iwan Setyawan, Provetic’s chief executive officer, even noted in a tweet that more than a quarter of the mentions were potentially rebroadcast tweets, or tweet bots.

Meanwhile, Meidyatama Suryodiningrat, the editor in chief of the Jakarta Post, wrote an editorial calling Mr. Widodo’s performance “a masterful display of strategy.” But he chose to leave a decision on a winner to the people, saying “they can now begin to judge for themselves the true nature of the stark choice before them.”
