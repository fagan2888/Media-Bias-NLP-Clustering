The OSC described the officials\u2019 conduct as part of a years-long \u201cculture of non-responsiveness.\u201d\n\n\u201cToo frequently, the VA has failed to use information from whistleblowers to identify and address systemic concerns that impact patient care,\u201d wrote U.S. Special Counsel Carolyn N. Lerner. VA officials have refused to acknowledge \u201cthe severity of systemic problems,\u201d she added, which prevented them from taking necessary steps to provide quality care to veterans.\n\n\u201cAs the VA re-evaluates patient care practices, I recommend that the Department\u2019s new leadership also review its process for responding to OSC whistleblower cases,\u201d wrote Lerner\n\nRelated: VA Bill Means a New $50 Billion Entitlement\n\nThe scandal first erupted April 30 when CNN reported that at least 40 U.S. veterans had died while awaiting care at the Phoenix, Ariz., VA medical center. The controversy ultimately triggered investigations by Congress, the White House, and the Justice Department, and led to the resignation of VA Secretary Eric K. Shinseki on May 30. Sloan Gibson, who took over as acting secretary, said he accepts the OSC\u2019s recommendations and directed a comprehensive review by the Office of the Medical Inspector\u2019s operations to be completed in two weeks, The Washington Post reported.\n\n\u201cI am deeply disappointed not only in the substantiation of allegations raised by whistleblowers, but also in the failures within VA to take whistleblower complaints seriously,\u201d Gibson said in a statement.\n\nLerner said her agency is still investigating over 50 whistleblower disclosures, \u201call of which allege threat to patient health or safety.\u201d These cases represent more than a quarter of all matters referred by OSC for investigation.\n\nAn internal VA audit released June 9 concluded that more than 120,000 veterans were left waiting or never got care, according to CNN. Moreover, schedulers were under pressure to employ inappropriate practices to make waiting times appear more favorable.\n\nRelated: Shinseki Falls on Sword in VA Scandal\n\nWhile more horror stories may surface as investigations proceed, here are seven of the worst outrages at VA medical centers as outlined in the OSC\u2019s letter to the president:\n\n1) A long-term mental health care facility in Brockton, Mass., neglected patients and let them languish for years without adequate attention or treatment. One veteran with a 100 percent service-connected psychiatric condition lived at the facility from 2005 to 2013, yet in all that time had only one psychiatric note written in his medical chart \u2013 in 2012, when he was first examined by a whistleblower.\n\nA second veteran was admitted to the same facility in 2003 with \u201csignificant and chronic mental health issues,\u201d yet his first comprehensive psychiatric evaluation did not happen until 2011, according to the report. \u201cNo medication assessments or modifications occurred until the 2011 consultation,\u201d said the OSC.\n\n2) Rampant problems with patient care existed at the Jackson, Miss., VA medical center \u2013 first revealed in September 2013 \u2013 that included \u201cimproper credentialing of providers, inadequate review of radiology images, unlawful prescriptions for narcotics, noncompliant pharmacy equipment used to compound chemotherapy drugs, and unsterile medical equipment,\u201d according to the report. There were also chronic staffing shortages in the primary care unit. Administrators sought to hide the problem with a \u201cghost clinic\u201d system in which veterans were scheduled for appointments in clinics with no assigned provider, \u201cresulting in excessive wait times and veterans leaving the facility without receiving treatment,\u201d according to the report.\n\n3) In Montgomery, Ala., a health care provider specializing in diseases of the respiratory tract copied prior notes to represent current readings in over 1,200 patient records, \u201clikely resulting in inaccurate patient health information being recorded,\u201d the report said. The OSC, however, couldn\u2019t determine whether this practice endangered the health of the patients.\n\n4) A VA facility in Grand Junction, Colo., had elevated levels of Legionella bacteria in its drinking water. The bacteria can cause Legionnaires Disease, a potentially lethal pneumonia-type illness. Despite complaints, standard maintenance and cleaning procedures required to prevent bacterial growth were not performed.\n\n5) There was subpar patient care at a VA facility in Little Rock, Ark., including one incident \u201cwhen suction equipment was unavailable when it was needed to treat a veteran who later died\u201d \u2013 although investigators failed to directly link the death and the inadequate treatment.\n\n6) In San Juan, Puerto Rico, \u201cnursing staff neglected elderly residents by failing to assist with essential daily activities such as bathing, eating, and drinking.\u201d\n\n7) Health care professionals at a VA facility in Buffalo, N.Y., did not always comply with sterilization standards for wearing personal protective equipment. The workers occasionally failed to place indicator strips in surgical trays and mislabeled sterile instruments.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The scandalous practice of Veterans Affairs medical centers to obfuscate long waiting lists for veterans who needed medical treatment is just the tip of the iceberg, as we\u2019re now learning.
