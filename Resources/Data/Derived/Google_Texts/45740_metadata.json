(March 2016) (Photo: Courtesy of Doug Diny)\n\nMy dad, Doug Diny, will lead on Council\n\nEDITOR: As an ROTC cadet at University of Wisconsin-La Crosse, I am surrounded by leaders; however, the leader I have learned the most from is my dad.\n\nMy dad taught me how to shake hands like a man, how to treat elders and authority figures with respect, how to compete, play as a team member, how to lead and how to follow. I learned how to be on time for work, to study hard, shine my shoes and how to change a tire on the car he helped his kids buy with sweat equity. He taught me how to play cribbage, chess and to hunt and fish. He smoked a cigar on the front porch with me on my 18th birthday. Most importantly, he has shown me how to be a supportive, loving father I hope to be one day.\n\nI\u2019ve never met a person who couldn\u2019t get along with my dad, Doug Diny.\n\nThis constitutes my endorsement for Doug Diny for Wausau City Council.\n\nNick Diny,\n\nLa Crosse\n\nI\u2019m a millennial and I support Doug Diny\n\nEDITOR: I have known Doug Diny for over five years in both a personal and professional setting. I, too, primarily work remotely, and agree with Diny\u2019s ideas on attracting millennials back to the Wausau area. It would be great to see Wausau open up to more high-tech industries. I am excited for what the new east side riverfront development will bring in that regard.\n\nDiny certainly has the modern mindset required to understand the changing world and what it means for Wausau. Anyone who knows Diny also knows that he is overflowing with ideas for Wausau. His ideas are what Wausau needs. As a millennial, I couldn\u2019t think of a better person to lead Wausau City Council\u2019s District 4.\n\nPeter Goetsch,\n\nWausau\n\nDoug Diny is a man of character\n\nEDITOR: I am a graduate of Wausau East High School and a graduate from the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Wausau is my hometown and any chance I have to return home is valued beyond words because of the character of the city and the community. This character needs to exist in the city government and Doug Diny is the right man to bring this to the council.\n\nThe City Council truly makes a difference for individuals in Wausau. Diny has the ability to create positive change for this community and that is why I would encourage all individuals in Wausau City Council District 4 to vote Diny on April 5.\n\nAmy Hasenberg,\n\nCorning, N.Y.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://wdhne.ws/1MyBcdL", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Readers share their endorsements of Doug Diny for Wausau City Council.", "og": {"site_name": "Daily Herald Media", "description": "Readers share their endorsements of Doug Diny for Wausau City Council.", "title": "Letters: Vote Doug Diny for City Council", "url": "http://www.wausaudailyherald.com/story/opinion/readers/2016/03/29/letters-vote-doug-diny-city-council/82376228/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/wausaudailyherald.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Readers share their endorsements of Doug Diny for Wausau City Council.", "creator": "@wausauherald", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/7334c21a032b707ca621b4f8db3dedc109df622d/c=0-340-2247-2587&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2016/02/06/WIGroup/Wausau/635903465199033905-Diny.jpg", "title": "Letters: Vote Doug Diny for City Council", "site": "@wausauherald", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=884268453", "fb": {"app_id": 187427251271455}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": "doug diny, wausau city council"}, "article_summary": "Doug Diny is a candidate for Wausau City Council District 4.\nThis constitutes my endorsement for Doug Diny for Wausau City Council.\nDiny has the ability to create positive change for this community and that is why I would encourage all individuals in Wausau City Council District 4 to vote Diny on April 5.\nNick Diny,La CrosseI\u2019m a millennial and I support Doug DinyEDITOR: I have known Doug Diny for over five years in both a personal and professional setting.\nThis character needs to exist in the city government and Doug Diny is the right man to bring this to the council."}
