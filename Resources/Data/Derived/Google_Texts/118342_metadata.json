If you don\u2019t enjoy your job anymore and are looking forward to spending more time pursuing your own agenda, early retirement can be ideal. The challenge is that you need to save up for it and make that money last for several decades. Here are the financial milestones you should achieve before taking early retirement:\n\nYou have retirement cash flow. You need to calculate how much income you will have after leaving your job. Social Security benefits typically can\u2019t be started until age 62 at the earliest. If you retire before that, you will need income from somewhere else. You can withdraw from your 401(k) or Roth IRA, but you need to decide how much to withdraw per year and make sure you don\u2019t deplete your retirement fund too quickly.\n\nGet into the habit of tracking your cash flow while you\u2019re working, and practice living on your retirement budget for 12 months. It\u2019s even more important to control your spending in retirement because you'll have a fixed income. Monitoring your spending will allow you to understand where your money is going and help control lifestyle inflation as the years go by.\n\nYou know how your expenses will change. Certain expenses can be eliminated when you retire such as commuting costs. But some retirees end up spending more money annually after they quit working. Many people want to travel now that they have the time, and that will significantly increase your expenses unless you travel creatively. Other people spend money on hobbies they have been putting off for many years. A retirement budget needs to take into account all the activities that you would like to do as well as the usual bills.\n\nYou have retirement health insurance. Medicare won\u2019t kick in until you\u2019re 65, and you'll need to fund your own healthcare until then. You can keep your employer-sponsored health insurance for up to 18 months under COBRA, but you will probably have to pay a lot more than you used to while working. If your spouse is still working, then it\u2019s usually a much more affordable option to get coverage though his or her employer. The Affordable Care Act provides another option for early retirees, and you can shop for health insurance at your state\u2019s health insurance exchange. After retirement, your income will probably be lower, so you might qualify for tax credits to help cover the premiums. However, health insurance isn\u2019t cheap, and you might get sticker shock if you don\u2019t do your research before retiring.\n\nYou have no debt. If you have consumer debt, then you\u2019re probably not ready to retire early. It\u2019s also a good idea to pay off your mortgage before retirement so your monthly expenses will be reduced. Downsizing or relocating to a more affordable area can be a good option to reduce or get rid of a mortgage.\n\nYou have adjusted your portfolio. You need to make sure your asset allocation is properly targeted to meet your risk tolerance. Some early retirees have all their assets in stocks. That might be fine when you\u2019re still working because you can add money when the market is down. But that asset allocation probably needs to be adjusted after retirement. An early retiree also needs to be careful not to shift too much money into bonds because you need stocks for growth. When you\u2019re nearing retirement, reassess your risk tolerance and update your asset allocation accordingly.\n\nYou have achieved financial freedom. One way to estimate if you\u2019re ready for early retirement is to divide your investable assets by your annual expense. I call this the financial freedom ratio. If your financial freedom ratio is above 25, then you\u2019re in pretty good shape. You can use the 4 percent rule to withdraw from your portfolio, and chances are good that your money will last for 30 years or more. Of course, if you retire very early, then you probably need to be a bit more conservative and withdraw less until you\u2019re near 65, the normal retirement age.\n\nIf you have a healthy portfolio balance, no debt and a plan to deal with health care, then you might be ready to retire early. Try tracking your cash flow and living on your retirement budget for a while before pulling the plug. Once you retire, then you need to keep a good handle on your cash flow to make sure you don\u2019t overspend. Early retirement is a dream for many people, but it takes diligent saving and careful planning to make it real.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"usn-stitial-fact": "{\"slug\":\"150129_SocialSecurity\",\"text\":\"For single retirees, Social Security makes up 90 percent of their income.\"}", "usn-comments-mode": "facebook", "description": "Early retirement comes with extra risks that require careful\r\nplanning to overcome.", "zone": "blogs/On-Retirement/blogentries", "author": "Joe Udo", "og": {"url": "http://money.usnews.com/money/blogs/on-retirement/2014/06/16/5-ways-to-tell-if-you-are-ready-to-retire-early", "site_name": "US News & World Report", "type": "article", "description": "Early retirement comes with extra risks that require careful\r\nplanning to overcome.", "title": "5 Ways to Tell if You Are Ready to Retire Early"}, "twitter": {"title": "5 Ways to Tell if You Are Ready to Retire Early - US News", "description": "Early retirement comes with extra risks that require careful\r\nplanning to overcome.", "card": "summary", "site": "@USNews"}, "usn-platform-id": "a", "site": "money-news", "keywords": "personal budgets,savings,personal finance,investing,retirement,money,Joe Udo", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "published_at": "2014-06-16", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/usnewsandworldreport", "published_time": "2014-06-16"}, "usn-content-type": "article", "social_id": "http://t.usnews.com/Z1tcf6", "viewport": "width=980", "news_keywords": "retirement, early retirement, saving, investing, personal budgets, cash flow"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd36a4\"", "article_summary": "If you have consumer debt, then you\u2019re probably not ready to retire early.\nIf you have a healthy portfolio balance, no debt and a plan to deal with health care, then you might be ready to retire early.\nEarly retirement is a dream for many people, but it takes diligent saving and careful planning to make it real.\nOne way to estimate if you\u2019re ready for early retirement is to divide your investable assets by your annual expense.\nIf you don\u2019t enjoy your job anymore and are looking forward to spending more time pursuing your own agenda, early retirement can be ideal."}
