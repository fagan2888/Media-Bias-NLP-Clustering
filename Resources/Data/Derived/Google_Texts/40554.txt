I have watched my former colleagues, the graduate employees of the University of Missouri, rise up and demand respect and fair treatment, and I’m proud to have worked with them. It’s with sadness that I learned how very many Columbians received incorrect information regarding the graduate workers’ cause, and I feel it is my responsibility to do my part to share my insider’s view of what is going on.

I loved Columbia because of the kind and generous people there. One of many benefits I received there was a world-class education in writing, and as a holder of a doctorate in writing, I think it’s my responsibility to serve the Columbia community members I loved by telling them my story.

I left the East Coast and headed for Missouri to work.

Yes, being accepted into a Ph.D. program excited me, and I was eager to learn, but with a terminal master’s (MFA) already in hand, I was primed to teach.

What I could not do myself, back in pre-Obamacare 2010, was land a job. Not a job with benefits, that is — like so many master’s degree holders, I had dead-ended in adjunct teaching. And so, at age 31, I left the East Coast because the MU Ph.D. program offered, in an offer letter, health insurance and wages, though meager, in exchange for my teaching two courses per semester — the same load tenure-track faculty carry.

As is well known, last summer the administration rescinded insurance benefits from instructors enrolled as graduate students, hiding behind Obamacare legislation and the notion that graduates cannot be employees. As the administration clings, month after month, to the notion that I was never its employee, I have grown ever more disappointed and angry. I don’t have skin in the game anymore, in the sense that I don’t personally need the living wage and guaranteed health insurance that graduate workers hope to secure by unionizing.

Now, I’m a professor — my MU apprenticeship achieved its goal — but the five years I worked at MU make up a critical component of my life story — of who I am — and I want to protest the university’s denial of my work. By denying the truth about my labor, the administration denies how much my work in MU classrooms mattered. Of course, I hope that in setting the record straight about my own labor history at MU, I might contribute in some small way to the justice mission of graduate employees. Above all, I wish to do my part to make sure every Tribune reader has the information she needs about what has happened and why she should care.

A fact: I possess five W-2s that list the Curators of the University of Missouri (Employer identification number 43-6003859) as the employer who paid my wages — wages from which the federal and state governments withheld income tax.

Documents might list facts, but as a writer, I know they do not bring truths alive in other minds. That’s the work of stories. And so I ask that you permit me to tell the story of my labor. I’m proud of the students who grew with me as I gave them what I knew and read their papers — thousands of pages of their words — and helped them grow into the selves they wanted to be — into the best writers they could be.

I taught composition to more than 120 students, and I sat down with every one of them and showed them how to see promise in their own work — how to envision themselves as professionals with something to say. There’s no counting the comma splices I corrected, the missing transitions I supplied or the thesis statements I retrieved from final paragraphs. That was work — hard work.

I loved every minute of the fiction and nonfiction courses I taught, where I helped some 90 students make their imaginary worlds real for their peers and helped young memoirists move readers to tears of empathy by writing well about their thwarted longing and about their grief. Love or no love, it was hard work.

Because I shared their status as a student while also doing the work of teaching them, they trusted me with problems. So I coached many students through difficulties with parents, with money, with friends and with staying alive. I came out to them so they could feel safe coming out to me and so they could hear me tell them that it’s possible be gay and to live and be loved.

I taught three literature courses that empowered each course’s 30 students to see how art reflects them — or leaves them out. I am proud of that and of the way I took risks in the classroom, challenging myself and my students to say what we really felt and to listen to one another, even when it hurt. I was learning together with my students, and I know many loved my classes because I walked them into the unknown, holding their intellectual hands. I told them not to be afraid. I discovered new ideas with them right while the discovery was happening, in the classroom. My evaluations rave about how empowering it felt to have the teacher thanking students for what they taught her. My rank — at the very bottom of the instructor chain — meant I had little to lose, and as I work toward tenure, I appreciate that as a graduate student I could offer things that professors simply can’t.
