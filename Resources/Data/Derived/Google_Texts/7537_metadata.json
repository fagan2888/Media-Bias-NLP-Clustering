Even more people completed applications, the step prior to choosing a plan.\n\nThe statistics released yesterday from Covered California could bode well for health insurance exchanges that have their act together.\n\n\u201cThis has been a phenomenal experience as Californians have expressed in words and action their desire for affordable and quality health insurance coverage,\u201d Covered California executive director Peter V. Lee said in a news release. \u201cEnrollments and applications are surging, and we at Covered California \u2014 and our partners \u2014 are stepping up our game to meet the demand.\u201d\n\nI talked to Lee last month after California outpaced enrollments on HealthCare.gov, the federal marketplace for 36 states, during the month of October. (To be sure, the current sign-ups are still well below the exchange\u2019s goals for 2014.)\n\nThe news also has been positive out of New York. The New York State of Health exchange announced that, as of Monday, more than 69,500 people had signed up for private health plans through the state\u2019s marketplace, according to Capital New York. That\u2019s a big increase from a week earlier. As of Nov. 30, 45,000 people had selected a plan through the state\u2019s exchange, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services reported this week in its state-by-state tally.\n\nDonna Frescatore, executive director of New York State of Health, said in a statement: \u201cWe are very pleased to see these results, which show that tens of thousands of individuals and across the state are turning to nystateofhealth.ny.gov to access low-cost health insurance.\u201d\n\nEven HealthCare.gov, the federal marketplace handling enrollment for 36 states, is seeing a surge. In three days last week, after the beleaguered website was fixed, enrollment topped 56,000, The Washington Post reported.\n\nThe late success creates both promise and pitfalls. As the Dec. 23 deadline draws closer for plans that begin on Jan. 1, even more consumers are expected to sign up. These enrollments have to be transferred from the exchanges to the insurance companies, a process fraught with problems.\n\nAnd consumers have to pay their first month\u2019s premiums before their coverage takes effect. Errors or delays can derail coverage, at least for January.\n\n(The 2014 open enrollment season ends March 31 and those without coverage will have to pay a penalty.)\n\nHHS said Thursday that it is encouraging health insurers to be flexible and consider extending the payment deadline for coverage that begins Jan. 1. For its part, America\u2019s Health Insurance Plans, a trade group, was skeptical about the Obama administration\u2019s attempt to keep changing deadlines. Previously, federal officials extended the deadline to choose a plan from Dec. 15 to Dec. 23.\n\n\u201cWith only weeks to go before coverage begins, continued changes to the rules and guidance could exacerbate the challenges associated with helping consumers through the enrollment process,\u201d said Karen Ignagni, the group\u2019s CEO, in a statement. \u201cHealth plans will continue to do everything they can to protect consumers from potential coverage disruptions caused by the ongoing technical problems with HealthCare.gov.\u201d\n\nLike this story?
