What kid didn\u2019t watch Over The Top and think, \u201cHey, I can do that if I get big and strong\u201d?\n\nAustralian rugby player Ben Ross is definitely big and strong, but what he does lack is experience in the world of arm wrestling. Professional arm wrestler and former rugby player Wendell Sailor is also big and strong, but he also has experience in this bicep busting sport. Ross\u2019 inexperience and Sailor\u2019s experience came together in a big way on the Australian program The Footy Show, and the result is not for the faint of heart.\n\nAlthough Lincoln Hawk won a new life for him and his son with arm wrestling, most pro arm wrestlers also end up with fractures, ligaments, and muscle tears in their elbows and arms. One of the most common injuries associated with arm wrestling is tendonitis in the elbow caused by intense and prolonged pressure on the biceps, triceps, and elbows.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "dangers, arm, wrestling, pro, rugby, player, ben, ross, suffers, excruciating, injury, while, arm", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "A friendly arm wrestling match on an Australian rugby show demonstrates just how dangerous arm wrestling can be.", "title": "Why You Should Probably Consider Not Arm Wrestling [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/dangers-arm-wrestling-pro-rugby-player-ben-ross-suffers-excruciating-injury-while-arm-337880", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured_video/public/2015/06/12/dangers-arm-wrestling-pro-rugby-player-ben-ross-suffers-excruciating-injury-while-arm.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A friendly arm wrestling match on an Australian rugby show demonstrates just how dangerous arm wrestling can be.", "title": "Why You Should Probably Consider Not Arm Wrestling [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/dangers-arm-wrestling-pro-rugby-player-ben-ross-suffers-excruciating-injury-while-arm-337880", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured_video/public/2015/06/12/dangers-arm-wrestling-pro-rugby-player-ben-ross-suffers-excruciating-injury-while-arm.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/06/12/dangers-arm-wrestling-pro-rugby-player-ben-ross-suffers-excruciating-injury-while-arm.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2015-06-12T11:25:03-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-06-12T11:25:00-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "A friendly arm wrestling match on an Australian rugby show demonstrates just how dangerous arm wrestling can be."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd071b\"", "article_summary": "At first glance, arm wrestling doesn\u2019t look all that challenging as long as you have a freakishly big arm.\nAustralian rugby player Ben Ross is definitely big and strong, but what he does lack is experience in the world of arm wrestling.\nAlthough Lincoln Hawk won a new life for him and his son with arm wrestling, most pro arm wrestlers also end up with fractures, ligaments, and muscle tears in their elbows and arms.\nProfessional arm wrestler and former rugby player Wendell Sailor is also big and strong, but he also has experience in this bicep busting sport.\nOne of the most common injuries associated with arm wrestling is tendonitis in the elbow caused by intense and prolonged pressure on the biceps, triceps, and elbows."}
