Dennis Daugaard, shown speaking with Argus Leader Media on Tuesday, is trying to push Medicaid expansion as well as a sales-tax increase for teacher pay during the 2016 Legislative session. (Photo: Jay Pickthorn / Argus Leader)\n\nFor the life of him, Gov. Dennis Daugaard couldn\u2019t recall the miserly moniker bestowed upon him by critics who found the Republican executive too fiscally conservative to make an actual difference.\n\n\u201cWas it Grandpa Cheap?\u201d Daugaard asked during a visit to the Argus Leader Media offices this week.\n\n\u201cI think it was Grandpa Frugal,\u201d someone offered.\n\n\u201cAh, yes,\u201d he said. \u201cThank you.\u201d\n\nThe softening of that label, from cheap to frugal, is nothing compared to the political transformation taking shape as Daugaard splashes loudly into his sixth legislative session as governor, with alliances and legacies at stake.\n\nThe 62-year-old former Sioux Falls business executive strongly supports a half-cent sales tax hike to raise teacher pay, changing course on an issue that has dogged him through much of his tenure but gained intensity since his 2014 re-election.\n\nWhy is he supporting an education funding initiative that he previously thought should be left to the devices of local school districts? It\u2019s simple, really. He listened to the concerns of his constituency and opted to change his mind \u2013 a refreshing example of flexibility amid rigid ideological times.\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t convinced that South Dakota teacher pay, after adjusting for taxes and cost of living, was uncompetitive, and now I am convinced,\u201d Daugaard said when I asked about his change of heart. \u201cI wasn\u2019t convinced that teacher shortages were any worse than they were a decade or two decades ago, and I am convinced now. They\u2019re worse.\u201d\n\nOf course, Daugaard now faces heat from both sides. Republicans uncomfortable with a tax increase are undercutting his proposal by promising Plan B enlightenment if the governor\u2019s push fails. Democrats are riled by the reality that some school districts may have to cut teachers (or not fill openings) to get salaries to the desired average of $48,500.\n\nBut a plan that generates more than $62 million to raise salaries and has the support of the teachers union is the most promising South Dakota has seen in a while, and Daugaard\u2019s willingness to take political heat to make it happen has the genuine feel of leadership.\n\nIf that weren't enough, the governor unveiled a Medicaid expansion plan that would help extend coverage to 55,000 additional South Dakota residents in conjunction with the federal Affordable Care Act, more commonly known as Obamacare.\n\nDaugaard isn\u2019t the only Republican governor to embrace a strategy to address state health care needs with greater access to federal funds, which in South Dakota\u2019s case means broadening Indian Health Services reimbursement parameters.\n\nBut the very notion that a South Dakota GOP standard bearer would align himself even indirectly with President Obama was enough to provoke shrieks of outrage in Pierre.\n\nThis is a growing dichotomy in American politics, where the battle cry of ideology tries to shout down policies of non-partisan pragmatism, casting heroes and villains along the way.\n\nDaugaard, who toed the line by holding back praise of the Democratic president during Obama's visit to Watertown last spring, sees the absurdity of using national party bias to determine the best course of action for matters within his own state.\n\n\u201cThere is a stigma attached to President Obama,\u201d said Daugaard. \u201cHe is very disliked in South Dakota. By attaching Medicaid expansion to him, the interest of people in supporting it goes down, just by the very association of the name.\u201d\n\nRight on cue, conservatives slammed the governor for trying to drag South Dakota further into a federal entitlement program, though he pointed out that 60 percent of those eligible under the Medicaid expansion are employed.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re not lazy people who want to be on the public dole,\u201d Daugaard said. \u201cThey\u2019re working but not earning enough to afford health care, which is expensive.\u201d\n\nThose aren\u2019t words you\u2019ll see on many GOP campaign mailers, but they\u2019re admirable for the chief executive of a state with a Native American health care crisis that is growing more troublesome by the day.\n\nOn teacher pay and Medicaid, the governor had a decision to make. He could cruise through his second term without ruffling conservative feathers, solidifying his reputation as a sturdy fiscal guardian without achieving much of anything. Or he could make an effort to solve problems of significant concern to many of the citizens he represents.\n\nDaugaard was re-elected in 2014 with more than 70 percent of the vote, giving him the biggest gubernatorial landslide in state history and a piggy bank of political capital to spend during his final term. If he was going to adopt a \u201cget things done\u201d approach and circumvent traditional party channels, he had to choose his battles wisely.\n\n\u201cHowever pragmatic a solution may be, if it\u2019s politically not saleable, I don\u2019t want to propose it and waste the political capital I may need to propose a plan that could pass,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I push and fail too many times, people are less likely to endorse or support those plans.\u201d\n\nThat tone of cautious aggressiveness led to the formation of the Blue Ribbon Task Force on education, illustrating the governor's more nuanced view of South Dakota\u2019s lowest-ranked teacher pay status.\n\nUnlike occupations that could point to low cost of living and no state income tax to soften the blow of their low national ranking, education salaries weren\u2019t tied to competitive market influences but instead were government controlled.\n\n\u201cThey were more a matter of political decisions,\u201d said Daugaard. So he decided to make one.\n\nHe commissioned a poll paid for with campaign funds, showing that at least 71 percent of likely voters favor using a half-cent sales tax for teacher pay, and he took it to legislators to bolster his plan. His staff beat the bushes with task force data and testimony linking South Dakota\u2019s alarming teacher shortage to substandard salaries, a connection Daugaard had earlier dismissed.\n\n\u201cLast year at about this time, there was a great hue and cry to put a lot more money into education, but it was all based on anecdote and opinion,\u201d Daugaard said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t founded in data that I could see; it was all just complaints. Well, that\u2019s nothing new. I wasn\u2019t convinced until the task force spent some time analyzing this that something needed to be done.\u201d\n\nHe spoke with an administrator in Avon, where elementary school openings that used to draw 40 applicants are now bringing in two or three. He heard from statewide educators concerned that the quality of education could suffer greatly if qualified young teachers don\u2019t view South Dakota as a viable place to make a living.\n\nMost of all, though, Daugaard did something that you don\u2019t see in politics very often. He admitted that he was wrong. He reversed course in the face of overwhelming evidence and decided to fight for something that could make his state better, no matter the political cost.\n\nDaugaard is a 62-year lame duck executive who hasn\u2019t strayed much into political ideology anyway. He is known for nuts-and-bolts governance and running a tight ship, which makes his positions on teacher pay and Medicaid expansion all the more remarkable.\n\nIf Daugaard is supporting these proposals as a Republican governor in a rabidly red state, it\u2019s reasonable to infer that a need existed all along and someone just had to find some chutzpah. Who would have guessed that Grandpa Frugal would be the one?\n\nThe politics of pragmatism will be sorely tested in the weeks ahead, since Daugaard needs a two-thirds majority to pass the sales tax increase for teacher pay and is battling the specter of Obamacare with Medicaid.\n\nWhen last seen, he was fighting to make the case for progress, fully aware that his political reputation among conservatives could be tarnished. This resolve to push forward despite the looming unpopularity of your actions is known as leadership, and it\u2019s rare enough in these parts that we should tip our cap when it actually occurs.\n\nArgus Leader Media city columnist Stu Whitney can be reached at swhitney@argusleader.com.
