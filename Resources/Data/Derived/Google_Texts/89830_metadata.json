A nurse that treated the Dallas patient who died of the disease last week has tested positive for it, after being quarantined Friday with a low-grade fever. What\u2019s particularly alarming about this diagnosis is that the nurse was considered at low-risk form contracting the virus. CDC director Tom Frieden blamed Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital Dallas calling the infection a breach in protocol and warned that we might see more cases of Ebola in the coming days.\n\nFrieden\u2019s words are particularly alarming considering that many American politicians and governmental agencies don\u2019t believe the U.S. is financially prepared for any outbreak.\n\nHillary Clinton spoke last week saying that Federal spending cuts have hurt the fight against the virus. \u201cThe [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] is another example on the response to Ebola \u2014 they\u2019re working heroically, but they don\u2019t have the resources they used to have,\u201d she said.\n\nNational Institutes of Health Director Dr. Francis Collins said Sunday that there would have been an Ebola vaccine already had it not been for budget cuts and Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal blamed The Affordable Care Act for taking money from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nThe CDC has received less than $3 billion over the last five years to fight infectious disease, a figure Governor Jindal argues is much too little.\n\nThe Ebola virus has clearly become an election issue, with Republican candidates calling for more money and attention to be given to preventing the spread of Ebola in America and criticizing President Barack Obama\u2019s stance on the topic.\n\nAccording to federal reports, fighting Ebola both abroad and at home could cost U.S. taxpayers $1 billion without even including the cost of treating the virus in domestic hospitals. The report estimates that treating an Ebola victim could cost between $2000 and $5000 daily; protective suits alone cost $1,000 each.\n\nYahoo Finance Senior Columnist Michael Santoli doesn\u2019t believe that throwing money at the situation will make it any better. \u201cIt seems to me much more about procedure and information getting out there as opposed to getting money into municipal governments,\u201d he says.\n\nSantoli points to how the United States distributed funding to beef up security in response to terror threats immediately following September 11th, 2001. \u201cWe treated every congressional district and even county as if they were equally vulnerable and we funneled money through a bureaucracy to get it there,\u201d he says. \u201cWe don\u2019t have time to do that now; this virus is working at its own speed , not on bureaucratic speed. So I guess we have the money\u2026 the question is whether we\u2019re mobilized in the right ways.\u201d\n\nThe World Bank has estimated that Ebola will cost West Africa $32.6 billion by the end of 2015.", "article_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "description": "From Yahoo Finance: The first case of Ebola has been transmitted in the United States-- do we have the funding to deal with an outbreak?", "original-source": "http://finance.yahoo.com/news/can-the-u-s--afford-an-ebola-outbreak--160654314.html", "og": {"site_name": "Yahoo Finance", "description": "The first case of Ebola has been transmitted in the United States-- do we have the funding to deal with an outbreak?", "title": "For politicians, Ebola is just another budget battle", "url": "http://finance.yahoo.com/news/can-the-u-s--afford-an-ebola-outbreak--160654314.html", "image": "http://l2.yimg.com/bt/api/res/1.2/8fMUQyUAhZYt1zMDvMzeig--/YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3NfbGVnbztpbD1wbGFuZTtxPTc1O3c9NjAw/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/video/video.pd2upload.com/video.yahoofinance.com@796fa345-6bca-3248-8c0f-bd91d8895541_FULL.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The first case of Ebola has been transmitted in the United States-- do we have the funding to deal with an outbreak?", "title": "For politicians, Ebola is just another budget battle", "image": {"src": "http://l2.yimg.com/bt/api/res/1.2/8fMUQyUAhZYt1zMDvMzeig--/YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3NfbGVnbztpbD1wbGFuZTtxPTc1O3c9NjAw/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/video/video.pd2upload.com/video.yahoofinance.com@796fa345-6bca-3248-8c0f-bd91d8895541_FULL.jpg", "identifier": "http://l2.yimg.com/bt/api/res/1.2/8fMUQyUAhZYt1zMDvMzeig--/YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3NfbGVnbztpbD1wbGFuZTtxPTc1O3c9NjAw/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/video/video.pd2upload.com/video.yahoofinance.com@796fa345-6bca-3248-8c0f-bd91d8895541_FULL.jpg"}, "site": "@YahooFinance", "dnt": "on", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#6e329d", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "fb": {"app_id": 90376669494}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://l.yimg.com/os/mit/media/p/presentation/images/icons/win8-tile-1484740.png", "application-name": "For politicians, Ebola is just another budget battle", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/yahoofinance"}, "theme-color": "#400090"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca10c\"", "article_summary": "The report estimates that treating an Ebola victim could cost between $2000 and $5000 daily; protective suits alone cost $1,000 each.\nThe Ebola virus has clearly become an election issue, with Republican candidates calling for more money and attention to be given to preventing the spread of Ebola in America and criticizing President Barack Obama\u2019s stance on the topic.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have time to do that now; this virus is working at its own speed , not on bureaucratic speed.\nFrieden\u2019s words are particularly alarming considering that many American politicians and governmental agencies don\u2019t believe the U.S. is financially prepared for any outbreak.\nA second case of Ebola has been diagnosed in the United States."}
