Highmark, the state's largest health insurer with 5.3 million members in three states, said the deal closed when it was approved by the state Department of Insurance. The merger with the Wilkes-Barre-based company extends Highmark's reach to 13 counties in the northeast part of the state, and reduces the number of nonprofit Blue Cross companies in the state from four to three. As part of the merger agreement, Highmark will maintain operations and staffing levels in Wilkes-Barre. It agreed to make charitable contributions of $90 million to support health and wellness in northeastern Pennsylvania.

Tom Wolf on Monday called the requests from Highmark and three other companies \u201cextremely concerning\u201d and pledged to review them and \u201creject excessive rate increases,\u201d his office said.\n\n\u201cThe most important consideration for the governor is the impact these rate proposals could have on consumers,\u201d according to the statement.\n\nHighmark seeks increases ranging from 9 percent to 28 percent on policies it sells directly to individuals outside the marketplace and to small businesses.\n\nIf approved, the rate hikes would affect nearly 270,000 Highmark individual customers and about 30,000 policyholders who have plans through a small business.\n\nPolicyholders would have a chance to shop for coverage from other carriers when open enrollment for 2016 starts Nov. 1.\n\nHighmark spokesman Aaron Billger said the rate increases were caused by customers, most of whom were uninsured, using more medical services than the company predicted when it set rates.\n\n\u201cThe pent-up demand for services from this population is driving greater utilization than anticipated,\u201d Billger said. \u201cIn fact, our data has found that, on average, individuals who purchased an ACA plan utilized services more than those who purchased coverage through an employer.\u201d\n\nThe proposed rate increases are being made two years after Highmark debuted marketplace rates in fall 2013 that were among the least expensive in the country. It attracted 131,000 customers for 2014, the most of any insurer in the state that year.\n\nThe low rates resulted in financial losses for the company. Highmark said it expects to recover $155 million from the government through a program meant to reduce losses for insurers selling marketplace plans.\n\nIn addition to Highmark, three insurance companies in Pennsylvania are proposing rate increases greater than 10 percent \u2014 a level that triggers greater scrutiny under the health law.\n\nFirst Priority, a joint venture owned by Highmark and Blue Cross of Northeastern Pennsylvania, requested rate hikes between 21 percent and 35 percent; Geisinger Health, which sells plans in Central Pennsylvania, wants increases of 40 percent to 58 percent; and Time Insurance Co., a subsidiary of Assurant Inc., requested a 61 percent increase.\n\nOther insurers selling marketplace plans in Western Pennsylvania \u2014 Aetna Inc., United Healthcare and UPMC Health Plan \u2014 requested increases of less than 10 percent, according to the state Department of Insurance.\n\nJames McTiernan, a vice president at Downtown benefits consulting firm Arthur J. Gallagher, said insurers had little idea of what to expect when they set rates for marketplace plans. Some companies, such as Highmark, greatly underestimated how much it would cost to cover medical expenses for people gaining health insurance for the first time, he said.\n\n\u201cThey probably have a better feel now for what their risk looks like,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is just bringing the premium to accurately reflect the risk they've attracted.\u201d\n\nDozens of health insurers want price hikes well beyond 10 percent for individual coverage next year, according to preliminary rate information released on the government's HealthCare.gov website. Health plans in North Carolina, Illinois and Florida, among other states, asked for hikes of 20 percent or more.\n\nPremium prices are expected to be finalized this fall.\n\nAlex Nixon is a Trib Total Media staff writer.
