As a share of the overall economy, the most meaningful measurement, the deficit has also increased, now equaling 2.9 percent of GDP.\n\nThe total debt outstanding has also increased dramatically since last year. Total federal debt owed to the public is now equal to 76 percent of the economy. This is up a staggering two percentage points since last year.\n\nThis latest report from the CBO goes a long way to explain the insurgent wave now agitating the Republican presidential nomination. Federal spending, with Republicans in complete control of Congress, is now increasing again for the first time since Democrats controlled Congress. Federal debt is also accumulating at a faster pace than when Democrats were in charge.\n\nIt isn\u2019t surprising, then, that 60 percent of Republican voters feel \u201cbetrayed\u201d by the party\u2019s political leadership. Betrayed is certain a strong sentiment, but its hard to argue against that belief when Congressional Republicans are failing on the one issue that they campaign on most aggressively.\n\nThe increase in the deficit, in fact, is not due to some organic spending path that isn\u2019t immune to action by Congress. According to the CBO, the federal deficit would have decreased this year but for the actions by Republicans to pass their omnibus spending bill at the end of last year.\n\nLast year, the Republican in Congress voted to eliminate the \u201csequester,\u201d automatic, across-the-board spending cuts first enacted in 2011 as part of a deal to increase to nation\u2019s debt limit. This action, combined with the omnibus spending bill, which both boosted spending and enacted retroactive tax cuts without accompanying spending reductions, pushed the deficit $130 billion higher than CBO originally estimated last year.\n\nIt is important to remember that in 2011, when the automatic spending cuts were first enacted, Republicans had recently captured the House of Representatives, while Democrats still controlled the Senate. The return to higher deficits, then, has come at a time that Republicans have taken control of the Senate and now completely control the purse strings in Congress.\n\nRepublican voters are understandably frustrated that recent Republican budgets have continued to fund all of President Obama\u2019s priorities, including ObamaCare, executive amnesty and stricter regulatory action. Compounding this now, however, is the fact that Republicans are also funding a return to higher deficit spending.\n\nThe only political variable that has really changed between earlier budget agreements and this most recent deal that dramatically increases both the deficit and debt is Republican control of the US Senate.\n\nIt isn\u2019t unreasonable to wonder whether Republican control of the Senate was a mistake. If Republicans in Congress insist on funding all of Obama\u2019s initiatives, can\u2019t they at least do this in exchange for bringing down the deficit?", "article_metadata": {"description": "CBO: Federal Deficit Rising Again Under GOP Congress", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "CBO: Federal Deficit Rising Again Under GOP Congress", "title": "CBO: Federal Deficit Rising Again Under GOP Congress - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/12/paul-ryan-beard-sad-AP.jpg", "height": 480}, "updated_time": "2016-01-27T19:18:02-07:00", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/01/27/cbo-federal-deficit-rising-again-under-gop-congress/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "CBO: Federal Deficit Rising Again Under GOP Congress", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/12/paul-ryan-beard-sad-AP.jpg", "title": "CBO: Federal Deficit Rising Again Under GOP Congress - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": ",Big Government, Economics,CBO", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Big Government", "published_time": "2016-01-27T10:45:01-07:00", "categories": "Big Government,Economics", "modified_time": "2016-01-27T19:18:02-07:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe065a\"", "article_summary": "Federal spending, with Republicans in complete control of Congress, is now increasing again for the first time since Democrats controlled Congress.\nTotal federal debt owed to the public is now equal to 76 percent of the economy.\nCompounding this now, however, is the fact that Republicans are also funding a return to higher deficit spending.\nIt isn\u2019t unreasonable to wonder whether Republican control of the Senate was a mistake.\nAccording to the CBO, the federal deficit would have decreased this year but for the actions by Republicans to pass their omnibus spending bill at the end of last year."}
