It focuses on preferred provider organization (PPO) members with two or more chronic conditions.\n\nAnthem gives each provider member-level data so they can better coordinate care for the sickest PPO patients. Each provider also receives a care coordination fee, which goes toward funding additional clinical care and coordination.\n\nOf Anthem's 19 participating provider groups, six released collective results on inpatient care, outpatient care, professional costs and pharmacy costs.\n\nUC Davis Health System, for instance, whose patients typically have kidney disease, asthma, heart disease and behavioral health issues \"has reduced emergency department use, and our care managers have helped patients improve their adherence to medications,\" Thomas Balsbaugh, medical director for the Patient-Centered Medical Home program at UC Davis, said in the announcement.\n\nSeaView utilized Anthem's ACO pharmacy analytics to relay member-specific utilization trends that have a possible generic alternative to providers, while Sante Health System used Anthem's care coordination money to fund social workers who helped patients with psychological issues.\n\nAnthem experienced successful results soon after forming its ACOs. The insurer and HealthCare Partners saved $4.7 million during the first six months of 2013. The savings are notable because PPO patients can see doctors outside of the ACO. This is different from other ACO programs that cater toward the health maintenance organization population, FierceHealthPayer previously reported.\n\nFor more:\n\n- here's the announcement\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nNew payment and care coordination agreements in place between Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield and hundreds of primary care physicians in Indiana\n\nAnthem, HealthCare Partners ACO saved millions\n\nAnthem Blue Cross: 'At the forefront of the ACO movement'", "article_metadata": {"description": "Anthem Blue Cross's accountable care organizations saved $7.9 million in one year, the insurer\u00a0announced.\u00a0The ACOs fall under its Enhanced Personal Health Care Program, which it launched last year\u00a0to promote patient-centered care and compensate doctors who deliver coordinated, personalized care.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthPayer", "description": "Anthem Blue Cross's accountable care organizations saved $7.9 million in one year, the insurer\u00a0announced.\u00a0The ACOs fall under its Enhanced Personal Health Care Program, which it launched last year\u00a0to promote patient-centered care and compensate doctors who deliver coordinated, personalized care.", "title": "Anthem's ACOs saved $7.9M in one year", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthpayer.com/story/anthems-acos-saved-79m-one-year/2015-06-05", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthpayer.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "healthpayer", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "keywords": "accountable care organizations,Anthem Blue Cross,Patient Care & Outcomes,patient-centered care,PPO", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Patient Care & Outcomes"}, "article_summary": "The ACOs fall under the insurer's Enhanced Personal Health Care Program--which it launched last year to promote patient-centered care and compensate doctors for delivering coordinated, personalized care.\nAnthem Blue Cross's accountable care organizations (ACOs), which are spread throughout California, saved $7.9 million in one year, the insurer announced.\nEach provider also receives a care coordination fee, which goes toward funding additional clinical care and coordination.\nOf Anthem's 19 participating provider groups, six released collective results on inpatient care, outpatient care, professional costs and pharmacy costs.\nSeaView utilized Anthem's ACO pharmacy analytics to relay member-specific utilization trends that have a possible generic alternative to providers, while Sante Health System used Anthem's care coordination money to fund social workers who helped patients with psychological issues."}
