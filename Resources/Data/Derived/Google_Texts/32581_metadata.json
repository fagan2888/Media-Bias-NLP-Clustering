Now he expects coverage will cost him at least $2,000 more per year.\n\n\n\nHe also feels let down by President Barack Obama, who famously stated, \"If you like your health plan, you'll be able to keep your health plan, period.\"\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s either a failure of a promise or a lie or something,\u201d said Mauer, who lives in Hampden Twp.\n\nRelated: for people in need of affordable coverage, the end result is worth struggling through the glitches.\n\n\n\nInsurers across the county have sent out letters informing some customers their health plans will no longer be available. It\u2019s causing a national uproar. Some insurers say the situation is being distorted to make it seem that plans are being abruptly canceled.\n\n\u201cI think the most important thing to understand is that people aren\u2019t being thrown off their plan mid-year. \u2026 You are on your plan until your expiration date,\u201d said Walt Cherniak of Aetna.\n\nThe situation involves plans that don\u2019t meet minimum coverage mandates contained in the Affordable Care Act. The 10 \u201cessential\u201d benefits include items such as maternity care, prescription drugs and mental health treatment.\n\nSome also are being canceled because they are \u201cmedically underwritten,\u201d meaning premiums are based on medical history of conditions such as diabetes or knee surgery. Now, insurers can adjust premiums only according to geographic location, age and smoking status. And there are limits on how much more they can charge.\n\nIn Pennsylvania, Highmark Inc. has sent letters to about 180,000 people who have individual health plans.\n\nThis includes about 40,000 people with so-called \u201cguaranteed issue\u201d plans for people whose medical histories would have caused most insurers to reject them. Blues plans typically offer coverage as part of their nonprofit mission.\n\nCoverage for the affected Highmark members ends Dec. 31. They can buy a different Highmark plan or shop for one on the insurance exchange.\n\nHighmark spokeswoman Kristin Ash predicts most of them will be able to find lower prices. \u201cAlmost all of (the affected customers) will be getting better coverage at a better price come Jan. 1,\u201d she said.\n\nThat\u2019s because their health problems -- pre-existing conditions -- can no longer be held against them. They'll be part of much larger pool of insured people, with more healthy people to help offset their costs, according to Ash. Some also will qualify for government subsidies, which are based on income.\n\nBut Aji Abraham of Capital BlueCross, while agreeing that 2014 premiums will be lower for most, said that might not be true in subsequent years. It will depend on whether the exchanges succeed in attracting enough young, healthy people to sufficiently lower costs for the sickest, he said.\n\nCapital has sent letters to about 9,000 guaranteed-issue customers.\n\nAnd Highmark and Capital sent letters to an additional group of people who tend to be healthier and who paid lower rates because of their good health. Highmark sent 140,000 such letters; the number sent by Capital wasn\u2019t immediately available. These customers are being allowed keep their plan in 2014 as long as they renew in 2013. Their old plan will be gone in 2015.\n\nHealth insurers acknowledge these customers are the ones mostly likely to see premium increases.\n\nThis group includes Maurer, the landscaping business owner. Having received a letter from his insurer, Highmark, he began trying to explore options on the exchange on Oct 1. He hasn't gotten far.\n\n\u201cEvery time I try to log in, it just gives me blank screens. I\u2019ve kind of put it on hold,\u201d he said this week.\n\n\n\n\n\nMaurer pays $195 per month for a plan that has no deducible and charges him 10 percent of the negotiated costs when he sees a doctor or needs medical care. Once he reaches a $1,500 cap, he pays no more co-pays for the rest of the year.\n\nBased on a discussion with a Highmark representative, a similar plan with a $500 deductible will now cost him about $315 per month.\n\nMauer has been trying to maintain a fact-based, open-minded view of the exchange. As a veteran online shopper, he concedes that an electronic health insurance market that allows side-by-side comparison is a major step forward.\n\nIt also crossed his mind that the exchange might enable him to eventually provide health benefits for his employees.\n\nBut he also realizes he\u2019ll wind up paying more because his premiums will go to help unhealthy people. He wonders about the fairness.\n\n\u201cI am willing, to a certain extent, to pay more, but I hope it ends up being something that is fair for everybody,\u201d said Maurer, who doesn\u2019t expect to qualify for subsidies toward his costs.\n\nHe also has misgivings about the individual mandate requiring most people to have health insurance in 2014.\n\n\u201cI think if the system could be good enough and affordable enough people would do it without being required,\u201d he said.\n\nJim Beidler of Berks County also received a letter from his insurer stating that his plan doesn\u2019t conform to the Affordable Care Act and won\u2019t be available in 2014.\n\nWhile exchange glitches have prevented him from enrolling, he has been able to view available plans. He concluded his premium will drop by nearly $180 per month, and his total costs, including co-pays, will be nearly $4,000 less than in 2013.\n\n\u201cTo me, losing this policy is like losing a used car and being given the keys to a brand new one at a lower cost,\u201d said Beidler, 53, a self-employed genealogy expert and tax preparer.\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "'@mobile','@topstories','health care'", "title": "Business owner deals with exchange glitches on top of Obamacare cancelation of current coverage", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Business owner deals with exchange glitches on top of Obamacare cancelation of current coverage\", \"link\": \"http://www.pennlive.com/midstate/index.ssf/2013/11/obamacare_obama_insurance_canc.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://imgick.pennlive.com/home/penn-media/width620/img/midstate_impact/photo/13688463-standard.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"11548502\", \"pub_date\": \"2013-11-01T14:45:11Z\", \"author\": \"David Wenner | dwenner@pennlive.com\", \"tags\": [\"@mobile\",\"@topstories\",\"health care\"] }", "twitter": {"image": "http://media.pennlive.com/midstate_impact/photo/13688463-thumb_square_large.jpg", "creator": "@DavidRWenner", "site": "@pennlive", "card": "summary", "description": "The health insurance plan of a 27-year-old business owner, who was well-satisfied with his coverage, will likely have to buy a more expensive one because of Obamacare."}, "article_date_updated": "Friday, November 01, 2013, 12:03 PM", "parsely-metadata": "{\"image_url\": \"http://media.pennlive.com/midstate_impact/photo/mid-staters-signing-up-for-obamacare-9744916acfedea21.jpg\", \"author_name\": \"dwenner\", \"author_nickname\": \"David Wenner | dwenner@pennlive.com\", \"author_id\": \"569\", \"source_blog_name\": \"Breaking News on PennLive\", \"source_blog_url\": \"http://www.pennlive.com/midstate/index.ssf/\", \"sponsored_content\": \"0\" }", "og": {"site_name": "PennLive.com", "description": "The health insurance plan of a 27-year-old business owner, who was well-satisfied with his coverage, will likely have to buy a more expensive one because of Obamacare.", "title": "Business owner deals with exchange glitches on top of Obamacare cancelation of current coverage", "url": "http://www.pennlive.com/midstate/index.ssf/2013/11/obamacare_obama_insurance_canc.html", "image": "http://www.pennlive.com/static/aff/static/img/logos/logo_fb.jpg", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "PennLive.com", "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Friday, November 01, 2013, 10:45 AM", "article_author": "David Wenner | dwenner@pennlive.com", "Description": "The health insurance plan of a 27-year-old business owner, who was well-satisfied with his coverage, will likely have to buy a more expensive one because of Obamacare."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcbbc8\"", "article_summary": "He also feels let down by President Barack Obama, who famously stated, \"If you like your health plan, you'll be able to keep your health plan, period.\"\nRelated: for people in need of affordable coverage, the end result is worth struggling through the glitches.\nThey can buy a different Highmark plan or shop for one on the insurance exchange.\nThe 27-year-old landscaping company owner liked his health plan.\nInsurers across the county have sent out letters informing some customers their health plans will no longer be available."}
