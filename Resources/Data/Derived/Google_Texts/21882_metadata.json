This time it went numb.\n\nRockies trainer Keith Dugger and manager Walt Weiss started running out to the mound even before Buster Posey crossed the plate following a two-run home run in the Giants\u2019 3-0 victory over the Rockies on Tuesday night.\n\nDe La Rosa hurt the thumb on his pitching hand trying to bunt in the top of the sixth. He walked Hunter Pence to open the inning and wasn\u2019t able to get the ball down against Posey, who took advantage of a 3-1 delivery to give the Giants the lead.\n\n\u201cI got jammed and it went numb right away,\u201d De La Rosa said. \u201cI made the mistake to Posey and paid for it.\u201d\n\nThe visit to the mound was short. He shook his head no in response to a Dugger question and was headed out of the game with a left thumb contusion.\n\n\u201cHe was cruising,\u201d Rockies\u2019 manager Walt Weiss said. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen him hurt that thumb before and he\u2019s pitched with it a lot. It was hurting pretty good.\u201d\n\nDe La Rosa said he had feeling in his thumb after the game and was confident he would make his next start.\n\nGiants starter Madison Bumgarner (15-9) took a perfect game into the eighth inning. National League batting leader Justin Morneau ended it with a double down the right-field line.\n\n\u201cOnce I got to two strikes I was just trying to put the ball in play,\u201d Morneau said. \u201cHe made a good pitch and I hit the right spot.\u201d\n\nBumgarner finished the game allowing just the one baserunner, and tied a career high with 13 strikeouts in ending the Rockies\u2019 three-game winning streak with his second shutout of August. It was his second career one-hitter, and his first since June 28, 2012 against the Cincinnati Reds.\n\n\u201cEverything was going right for him,\u201d Rockies\u2019 third baseman Nolan Arenado said. \u201cHe mixed in his cutter well and his fastball looked good to hit but it wasn\u2019t. He hit his spots.\u201d\n\nThe Rockies won each of Bumgarner\u2019s last three starts against them.\n\nDe La Rosa (13-9) had his losing streak to the Giants extended to five games and had his string of 11 consecutive games of pitching at least six innings come to an end.\n\nThe pitch to Posey was De La Rosa\u2019s only mistake in a game filled with pitching brilliance. He allowed two runs on four hits over five-plus innings, walking two and striking out five.\n\nDe La Rosa was also the losing pitcher when Clayton Kershaw threw his no-hitter against the Rockies on June 18 in Los Angeles.\n\nMatt Belisle took over and retired six straight but it wasn\u2019t enough on a night when Bumgarner was nearly perfect.\n\nDrew Stubbs\u2019 had a potential extra-base hit taken away when Gregor Blanco made a leaping catch against the left-field fence in the first inning and Brandon Crawford just barely got Matt McBride at first to end the fifth inning.\n\nPosey added his second home run with a shot off Brooks Brown in the eighth for a big insurance run.\n\nFootnote. Catcher Wilin Rosario was out of the starting lineup again because of lingering soreness in his left wrist. \u201cHe\u2019s getting treatment, and he\u2019s trying to swing the bat in the cage,\u201d Rockies manager Walt Weiss said. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to make a determination if he can play in the next day or two.\u201d Matt McBride, who did some catching during spring training, is the emergency catcher. Michael Mc Kenry started behind the plate.\n\nLooking ahead\n\nRockies\u2019 Franklin Morales (5-7, 5.32 ERA) at Giants\u2019 Tim Hudson (9-9, 2.99), 8:15 p.m. Wednesday, ROOT; 850 AM\n\nWith Tim Lincecum pulled from the starting rotation, the pressure is on Hudson to produce if the Giants are going to stay in the playoff hunt. Hudson allowed two runs (one earned) on five hits, walked one and struck out three over 5 innings in San Francisco\u2019s 10-3 win over the Nationals on Friday. He has been fairly solid at AT&T Park, going 5-4 with a 3.60 ERA in 12 starts. He\u2019s 5-2 with a 4.35 ERA in 13 career outings against the Rockies.\n\nThursday: Rockies\u2019 Jordan Lyles (6-1, 4.05 ERA) at Giants\u2019 Yusmeiro Petit (3-3, 3.59), 1:45 p.m., no TV\n\nFriday: Rockies\u2019 Christian Bergman (1-2, 6.75) at Diamondbacks\u2019 Josh Collmenter (9-7, 4.05), 7:40 p.m., ROOT\n\nSaturday: Rockies\u2019 Tyler Matzek (3-9, 5.14 ) at Diamondbacks\u2019 Vidal Nu\u00f1o (2-8, 4.66), 6:10 p.m., ROOT\n\nPatrick Saunders, The Denver Post", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Giants\u2019 Madison Bumgarner tosses one-hitter at Rockies", "title": "Giants\u2019 Madison Bumgarner tosses one-hitter at Rockies", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/08/26/giants-madison-bumgarner-tosses-one-hitter-at-rockies/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140826__rockies-giants-bumgarnerp1.jpg", "height": 484}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140826__rockies-giants-bumgarnerp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-08-26T22:52:45+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T11:31:42+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcab75\"", "article_summary": "\u201cI got jammed and it went numb right away,\u201d De La Rosa said.\nDe La Rosa hurt the thumb on his pitching hand trying to bunt in the top of the sixth.\nDe La Rosa was also the losing pitcher when Clayton Kershaw threw his no-hitter against the Rockies on June 18 in Los Angeles.\nSAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Jorge De La Rosa was used to pitching with a sore thumb.\nGiants starter Madison Bumgarner (15-9) took a perfect game into the eighth inning."}
