Well, make that a large one. Brooklyn\u2019s Brook Lopez, a skilled 7-foot center, had a breakout week deserving of The Denver Post\u2019s NBA player of the week award.\n\nWhat\u2019s up: In four games, the 26-year-old Lopez averaged 27.8 points, 6.8 rebounds, 2.3 blocked shots and one steal. He shot 61.3 percent from the field and 95 percent from the free-throw line. The Nets, who have played much better the past two weeks, won three of the four games \u2014 including a victory over LeBron James and the Cleveland Cavaliers on Friday.\n\nBackground: This has been an interesting season for Lopez, a Stanford product. He opened as the Nets\u2019 starting center, but after a back injury kept him out of eight games, he found his starting job had been taken by high-energy youngster Mason Plumlee. Lopez usually came off the bench from the end of December through the first week of March before he was reinserted into Brooklyn\u2019s starting five. He\u2019s been money ever since, putting up big numbers for the Nets almost every game.\n\nDempsey\u2019s take: This is the Brook Lopez the Nuggets had eyes for leading up to the trade deadline \u2014 a deadly scorer on the block who blocks and alters shots on the defensive end. The Nets rebuffed all trade offers, but they could lose Lopez if he opts out of the final year of his contract this summer. Doing so would make him a coveted, unrestricted free agent, and the Nuggets could make another run at acquiring him if they\u2019re able to clear the salary cap space needed to make that happen.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Brook Lopez,NBA,Nets,spotlight", "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "og": {"site_name": "Nuggets Ink", "description": "Brooklyn's Brook Lopez, a skilled 7-foot center, had a breakout week deserving of The Denver Post's NBA player of the week award.", "title": "Brook Lopez: Spotlight on the Brooklyn Nets center", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/nuggets/2015/03/28/brook-lopez-spotlight-on-the-nets-center/12770/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/nuggets/files/2015/03/Brook-Lopez.jpg", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "description": "Brooklyn's Brook Lopez, a skilled 7-foot center, had a breakout week deserving of The Denver Post's NBA player of the week award.", "title": "Brook Lopez: Spotlight on the Nets center", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/nuggets/2015/03/28/brook-lopez-spotlight-on-the-nets-center/12770/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/nuggets/files/2015/03/Brook-Lopez.jpg", "creator": "@dempseyPost", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "language": "en, sv", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "Brooklyn's Brook Lopez, a skilled 7-foot center, had a breakout week deserving of The Denver Post's NBA player of the week award."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd04d\"", "article_summary": "Spotlight on\u2026 Brook Lopez, center, NetsWhen: The March 21-27 evaluation period brought a small surprise to the table.\nHe opened as the Nets\u2019 starting center, but after a back injury kept him out of eight games, he found his starting job had been taken by high-energy youngster Mason Plumlee.\nBrooklyn\u2019s Brook Lopez, a skilled 7-foot center, had a breakout week deserving of The Denver Post\u2019s NBA player of the week award.\nThe Nets rebuffed all trade offers, but they could lose Lopez if he opts out of the final year of his contract this summer.\nWhat\u2019s up: In four games, the 26-year-old Lopez averaged 27.8 points, 6.8 rebounds, 2.3 blocked shots and one steal."}
