A fifth international college student has died following last week's crash of a charter bus and an amphibious tour vehicle, or duck boat, in Seattle.

Harborview Medical Center said late Sunday afternoon that the 20-year-old woman had passed away. Her name was not immediately released. She had previously been listed in critical condition.

She was one of about 45 students and staff from North Seattle College who were traveling Thursday to the city's Pike Place Market and Safeco Field for orientation events when the duck boat suddenly swerved into their oncoming charter bus. Four students died at the scene, and more than 50 people were taken to hospitals.

Thirteen people remained at Harborview Medical Center on Sunday, with four in intensive care in serious condition.
