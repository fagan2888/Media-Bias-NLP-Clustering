A likely driver: the \u201cCadillac\u201d tax on high-cost insurance that is set to go into effect in 2018.\n\nEnrollment in private health insurance exchanges has doubled in the last year, a trend that will likely continue over the next several years, according to a new report by global management firm Accenture.\n\nPrivate exchanges are increasingly attractive to employers, as they serve as online marketplaces where employees may pick from a range of plan options. Faced with increased costs and a barrage of Affordable Care Act (ACA) administrative requirements in the coming years, employers are often choosing to outsource the task and have employees enter a private exchange.\n\nPrivate exchanges enable employees to take a set amount of employer benefit and determine how generous a plan to purchase. Midsize employers with between 100 and 2,500 employees are responsible for the majority of the recent growth.\n\nWith 150 million workers receiving employer-sponsored health insurance, the market share held by private exchanges is still relatively small. Yet that may continue to change, as employers will face additional ACA taxes in the coming years. Accenture predicts that by 2018, up to 40 million workers will access employer-sponsored health insurance through a private marketplace, making them more popular than state- and federally funded exchanges.\n\nOne driving force behind increased adoption rate is likely to be the \u201cCadillac\u201d tax on high-cost health insurance that goes into effect in 2018. According to the American Health Policy Institute, the tax is projected to affect 38 percent of large employers and 17 percent of all American businesses.\n\nPrivate exchange participation rates may also increase after the ACA employer shared-responsibility provision went into effect on January 1 this year. Under this provision, employers with at least 50 full-time employees (or a combination of full- and part-time that is equivalent to 50 full-time employees) must pay a large fee if they do not provide health insurance that meets affordability levels and provides a minimum standard of coverage.\n\n\u201cAs employers seek a compelling alternative, the private exchange model of reducing costs and administrative burden emerges as a clear favorite,\u201d Rich Birhanzel, managing director for Accenture Health Administration Services, told Bloomberg BNA last week.\n\nShare this article", "article_metadata": {"description": "A new report by Accenture predicts that enrollment in private health insurance exchanges could grow dramatically over the next three years.", "pocket-site-verification": "f7059b70f081a1e1ced322fc1d9787", "og": {"site_name": "Associations Now", "description": "A new report by Accenture predicts that enrollment in private health insurance exchanges could grow dramatically over the next three years.", "title": "Growth Accelerating for Private Insurance Exchanges, Report Says", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://associationsnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/0415_medical.jpg", "url": "http://associationsnow.com/2015/04/growth-accelerating-private-insurance-exchanges-report-says/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Associations Now", "description": "A new report by Accenture predicts that enrollment in private health insurance exchanges could grow dramatically over the next three years.", "title": "Growth Accelerating for Private Insurance Exchanges, Report Says", "image": "http://associationsnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/0415_medical.jpg", "creator": "@associationsnow", "site": "@associationsnow", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"admins": 502961619}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/AssociationsNow", "section": "Uncategorized", "published_time": "2015-04-13T14:56:58+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Money & Business, Insurance Exchanges"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1b44\"", "article_summary": "Growth Accelerating for Private Insurance Exchanges, Report Says AND What's this?\nWith 150 million workers receiving employer-sponsored health insurance, the market share held by private exchanges is still relatively small.\nBy Chris Vest, CAE / Apr 13, 2015 (iStock/Thinkstock) (iStock/Thinkstock)A new report by Accenture predicts that enrollment in private health insurance exchanges could grow dramatically over the next three years.\nPrivate exchanges enable employees to take a set amount of employer benefit and determine how generous a plan to purchase.\nEnrollment in private health insurance exchanges has doubled in the last year, a trend that will likely continue over the next several years, according to a new report by global management firm Accenture."}
