Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., warned members of his party that big business can be just as corrosive as big government Tuesday in a Capitol Hill speech that strayed from GOP orthodoxy and sought to outline a new path forward for conservatism.

"There’s another fallacy popular among our ranks," Ryan said at Hillsdale College's Center for Constitutional Studies and Citizenship."Just as some think anything government does is wrong, others think anything business does is right. But in fact they’re two sides of the same coin. Both big government and big business like to stack the deck in their favor. And though they are sometimes adversaries, they are far too often allies."

Ryan's comments were particularly striking given his experience as the 2012 vice presidential nominee and the plutocratic image his ticketmate, Mitt Romney, continuously battled, largely unsuccessfully. Romney was seen as the candidate of the rich and someone who could not relate to the everyday needs of the working class and economically disadvantaged, a fate Ryan seems determined to avoid. The nation's largest business groups – none more than the U.S. Chamber of Commerce – have traditionally been aligned with the Republican Party and its candidates.

But Ryan, who is mulling a 2016 presidential bid of his own, called big business "a willing accomplice" of big government – a favorite target of the right – because of its incentive to cut out competition.

"Bureaucrats prefer to work with the big boys, instead of upstarts they don’t know," he said. "Many times they don’t oppose new regulations; instead, they help write them. The point is, crony capitalism isn’t a side effect; it’s a direct result of big government."

He lamented a culture of businessmen spending enormous amounts of time "hustling in Washington" to rig the rules in their favor rather than working within the marketplace. During this particular portion of the speech, his rhetoric almost seemed to mirror Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., who has become a liberal heroine for her scathing critique of a financial system that she sees as overwhelmingly favoring the well-off.

"Neither the founders of America nor of free-market economics would recognize in this stratified system a truly open market of commerce. It isn’t open. It isn’t equal in opportunity. It isn’t producing equitable profit growth or hope for those at the bottom of the ladder. It isn’t driven by satisfying the needs of people; but by experts, calculus, wealth and preference," he said.

On Monday in West Virginia, Warren told a campaign rally for Democratic Senate candidate Natalie Tennant, that "Citibank and Goldman Sachs and all those other guys on Wall Street, they’ve got plenty of folks in the U.S. Senate willing to work on their side. We need some more people willing to work on the side of America’s families."

Ryan, the House Budget Committee chairman who has visited inner cities in recent months to get an in-person look at poverty in America, has much different policy prescriptions than Warren, of course.

While Warren has stressed the financial reform law, commonly referred to as Dodd-Frank, hasn't gone far enough to curtail "too big to fail" banks, Ryan is calling for complete repeal of the legislation.

"These programs and their administrative forms – leading examples being Obamacare and the Dodd-Frank financial apparatus – cannot be reformed and restructured, but must be ended or, if we choose, replaced by something completely different and consistent with popular consent and self-government," he said Tuesday.

Ryan has also come out in favor of eliminating the Export-Import Bank, an entity he used as an "example of how bureaucratic government is corrupting free enterprise through and through."

"Cronyism is the progressives' project for economic control," he said. "Let them defend it."

Ryan and Warren were both in West Virginia Monday stumping for opposite candidates in the open seat Senate race there, but less than 24 hours later there's evidence there may be more agreement between the two on the influence of corporate America than originally thought.
