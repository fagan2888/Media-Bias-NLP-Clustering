(Photo: AP)\n\nBILOXI \u2013 Donald Trump shifted briskly from one topic to another and back again Saturday night during his rally at the Gulf Coast Coliseum in Biloxi.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like a love fest,\u201d he said of the event. \u201cPeople are so tired of the incompetence. They\u2019re so tired of stupidity.\u201d\n\nTrump railed against current Washington leadership, ISIS, illegal immigrants and took about 10 minutes during the hour-long speech to attack \u201ccorrupt\u201d media covering the event.\n\nThe rally was his first public appearance in the Magnolia State since the 1990s, when he had attempted to build a casino and aquarium in Gulfport.\n\nTrump has regularly expressed opposition to Syrian refugees settling in the United States, and the rally in Mississippi was no exception.\n\n\u201cWe have no idea who they are and where they come from,\u201d he said. \u201cI think maybe it is the ultimate Trojan horse.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s appearance in Biloxi followed reports that Al Shabaab, a Somali al Qaeda affiliate, issued a recruitment video that shows a clip of the presidential candidate speaking after the shooting in San Bernardino, California, last month. The video includes Trump\u2019s statements in support of banning Muslims from entering the United States.\n\nThat position has drawn criticism from Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton, who had said before the video\u2019s release that ISIS was using his statements in propaganda videos.\n\nTrump took a milder approach than he has in the past, making no mention of the videos, the Islamic faith or Muslims when discussing ISIS and Middle Eastern countries. He simultaneously was critical of the Iraq War and advocated for increasing the country\u2019s military.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to build our military so strong, so powerful. \u2026 We\u2019ll never have to use it hopefully,\u201d which transitioned into, \u201cI\u2019m someone who believes in the military, but you\u2019ve got to know how to use it.\u201d\n\nHe touched on his plans he announced Tuesday to begin spending millions on television advertising in Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina. Thus far, he has spent $300,000, compared to former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, who has spent more than $40 million.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to start spending quite a lot of money, because I want to be sure,\u201d Trump said. \u201cUntil now I\u2019ve loved it because I\u2019ve spent less than anyone else and had the best results. That\u2019s what should happen with our country.\u201d\n\nAt one point, Trump interrupted his speech to criticize video photographers at the event for not panning their cameras to show the crowd.\n\n\u201cSpin the camera,\u201d he told one cameraman, and at one point, \u201cThey\u2019re really dishonest people. I might fire his a-- right now.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe people are really smart,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThey get it. They know how crooked the system is. They know how crooked these reporters are, many of them.\u201d\n\nTrump was unavailable for questions before or after the event.\n\nTrump also attacked his rivals, particularly Clinton, Democratic frontrunner.\n\n\u201cEveryone knows she should be in jail,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat she did with the emails was a disgrace. She shouldn\u2019t be allowed to run.\u201d\n\nTrump mentioned goals to get rid of both the Affordable Care Act and Common Core, and returned to his plans to build a wall between the United States and Mexico \u2014 even bigger than the Great Wall of China.\n\n\u201cThis will be a real wall,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cLet people come into the country, but they\u2019re coming into the country legally.\u201d\n\nTrump has been described as a polarizing figure, but the same positions that have drawn criticism have attracted admirers, who say they support his \u201ctell it like it is\u201d attitude.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s not trying to be politically correct,\u201d Kathy Rogers of Hattiesburg said. \u201cHe brings up issues and what he believes in and doesn\u2019t care about what anyone else says.\u201d\n\nHjalmberi Shytox of Purvis also favors Trump\u2019s lack of political correctness.\n\n\u201cThe state is more or less dead,\u201d he said. \u201cI see Trump as a way to get back to where we were. \u2026 I believe in my heart if Hillary Clinton is elected, we might as well put a tombstone on this country.\u201d\n\nTrump is the second presidential candidate to campaign in Mississippi this election season after Ohio Gov. John Kasich\u2019s visit last year. The state\u2019s primary will take place on March 8.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://hatne.ws/1OBApDe", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Trump railed against current Washington leadership, ISIS, illegal immigrants and media.", "og": {"site_name": "Hattiesburg American", "description": "Trump railed against current Washington leadership, ISIS, illegal immigrants and media.", "title": "Trump, in Biloxi, rails against ISIS, 'corrupt media'", "url": "http://www.hattiesburgamerican.com/story/news/politics/elections/2016/01/03/trump-sounds-biloxi/78225342/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/hattiesburgamerican.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Trump railed against current Washington leadership, ISIS, illegal immigrants and media.", "creator": "@hburgamerican", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/cf69b5ce8dbf2c3a83fd472a0c3fffe76530321d/c=886-0-3946-3060&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2016/01/03/Hattiesburg/B9320355214Z.1_20160103005530_000_GVCD1OMB7.1-0.jpg", "title": "Trump, in Biloxi, rails against ISIS, 'corrupt media'", "site": "@hburgamerican", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=840334315", "fb": {"app_id": 176281025726180}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070"}, "article_summary": "Trump took on the current Washington leadership, ISIS, immigration and took about 10 minutes during his speech to attack \u2018corrupt media\u2019 covering the event.\nTrump has regularly expressed opposition to Syrian refugees settling in the United States, and the rally in Mississippi was no exception.\nTrump took a milder approach than he has in the past, making no mention of the videos, the Islamic faith or Muslims when discussing ISIS and Middle Eastern countries.\nThey\u2019re so tired of stupidity.\u201dTrump railed against current Washington leadership, ISIS, illegal immigrants and took about 10 minutes during the hour-long speech to attack \u201ccorrupt\u201d media covering the event.\nThe video includes Trump\u2019s statements in support of banning Muslims from entering the United States."}
