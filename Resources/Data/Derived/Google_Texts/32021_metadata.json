Bush said his decision to speak at Southern Methodist University\u2019s centennial commencement Saturday was a \u201cpractical one.\u201d\n\n\u201cI got a call from my landlord\u2026[SMU President] Gerald Turner,\u201d Bush said. \u201cRather than raising the rent or threatening to withhold our security deposit, I was relieved to hear President Turner ask me if I believed in free speech.\u201d\n\nBush said he did. Turner replied, \u201cperfect, here\u2019s your chance to give one.\u201d\n\nThousands of students and their families packed Moody Coliseum for the ceremony, which marked the 100th anniversary of school\u2019s spring commencement. Bush was both light-hearted and serious during his speech. He was self-deprecating at times about his speaking and painting skills, and he invoked his faith while prodding graduates to participate in the civic life.\n\nSaturday\u2019s commencement speech was the first Bush has given since leaving office, but his second at SMU. He first spoke at the university in 1999 while governor of Texas. His presidential center is on the campus.\n\nThough Bush is a Yale graduate, his wife Laura, who also attended the event, is an SMU graduate and board of trustees member.\n\nTurner said when discussing with students who should be the centennial commencement speaker, they said they needed someone \u201cvery special.\u201d\n\n\u201cI asked for examples and they had one, George W. Bush, the 43rd president,\u201d said Turner, who introduced Bush to a standing ovation. \u201cI was relieved when he said yes, my backup plan was to get a certain member of the board of trustees to twist his arm.\u201d\n\nSince leaving office, he has been a fixture on the SMU campus, occasionally dropping into classes where he said he was \u201cimpressed by the energy and intelligence of the SMU faculty.\u201d\n\nDuring his speech, Bush congratulated parents of the graduating students, and the students themselves.\n\n\u201cFor those of you graduating with high honors and distinctions, I say well done,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd as I like to tell the \u201cC\u201d students, you too can be president.\u201d\n\nBush encouraged students to serve others and while doing so, inspire others. He said he was inspired by \u201cthe example of many selfless servants,\u201d including former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill. He said Churchill inspired him during his presidency and his post-presidency.\n\n\u201cLike Churchill, I now paint,\u201d he said. \u201cUnlike Churchill, the painting isn\u2019t worth much without the signature.\u201d\n\nReferencing a speech Churchill gave in 1941, Bush said that even today some doubt the country\u2019s future.\n\n\u201cSome say America\u2019s best days are behind us,\u201d he said. \u201cI say, given our strengths \u2014 one of which is a bright new generation like you \u2014 these are not dark days, these are great days.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"liveFyreID": "aHR0cDovL3RoZXNjb29wYmxvZy5kYWxsYXNuZXdzLmNvbS8yMDE1LzA1L2dlb3JnZS13LWJ1c2gtZ2l2ZXMtY29tbWVuY2VtZW50LXNwZWVjaC1hdC1zbXVzLTEwMHRoLWdyYWR1YXRpb24tY2VyZW1vbnkuaHRtbC8=", "generator": "WordPress 3.9.12", "author": "Julie Fancher", "og": {"site_name": "The Scoop Blog", "description": "UNIVERSITY PARK -- Former President George W.
