The Weinberg alum came to Northwestern for the annual Admiral Weber Lecture.\n\nWhite House director of speechwriting Cody Keenan reflected on his personal experiences as President Barack Obama\u2019s lead speechwriter and as a Northwestern alumnus at a speaker event Wednesday evening.\n\n\u201cIf someone told me in 1998, that in 10 years I would be a speechwriter for the first black president, I would never believe them,\u201d Keenan said.\n\nKeenan (Weinberg \u201902) addressed more than 60 students and faculty at this year\u2019s Admiral Weber Lecture, an annual speaker series hosted by the political science department.\n\nAfter graduating from NU without a job, Keenan worked in Washington, D.C. for former Sen. Ted Kennedy before becoming a speechwriter.\n\n\u201cI had never considered speechwriting at all; I got pulled into it, which was very lucky,\u201d Keenan said. \u201cAny successful person that says luck didn\u2019t play into their success is lying to your face. But at the same time, I helped create my own lucky breaks by working hard and staying in politics.\u201d\n\nPolitical science Prof. Sara Monoson, the department chair, introduced Keenan, and political science and sociology Prof. Anthony Chen moderated the hour-long Q&A session.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe political science department invited Keenan because it thought his ties to NU would make him a particularly interesting speaker, Monoson said.\n\n\u201cWe reached out to Cody because we knew he\u2019s a proud Northwestern alumni and of course a very accomplished person in politics,\u201d Monoson told The Daily. \u201cHe\u2019s very direct in communication, and his personality really comes through when he speaks.\u201d\n\nThe audience asked Keenan about a wide range of topics, including college advice, speechwriting tips and electoral politics.\n\nWhen asked about the current state of U.S. politics, Keenan expressed concern over some of the presidential candidates and increased polarization, but said he is ultimately faithful in American democracy.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of demagoguery this election season,\u201d Keenan said. \u201cPeople will say things like, \u2018If you elect me, I will build a wall\u2019 or \u2018I\u2019ll make college free,\u2019 and that\u2019s what makes people cynical about politics \u2014 when these candidates get elected and their promises aren\u2019t kept.\u201d\n\nKeenan acknowledged that there has been unprecedented gridlock over the past eight years, but highlighted that the Obama administration covered 20 million more people with health care, saved the auto industry and helped the American economy recover from recession.\n\nMcCormick freshman Arturo Brant said he was surprised to learn Keenan had graduated without a job. Brant said it made him realize many successful people have humble beginnings and work hard to earn their success, which he said motivates him.\n\nKeenan also gave some insight on his relationship with the president, who he has worked closely with for more than eight years.\n\n\u201cI work for a guy who believes he can convince anyone with a rational mind that his policies will work,\u201d Keenan said. \u201cI\u2019ll tell him, \u2018Your 90th speech on Obamacare won\u2019t change anyone\u2019s opinion,\u201d and he\u2019ll just say, \u2018I don\u2019t care, I want to do a huge policy speech on it anyways.\u2019\u201d\n\nEmail: [email protected]\n\nTwitter: @mduanmu", "article_metadata": {"language": "en, sv", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Northwestern", "description": "White House director of speechwriting Cody Keenan reflected on his personal experiences as President Barack Obama\u2019s lead speechwriter and as a Northwestern alumnus at a speaker event Wednesday evening. \u201cIf someone told me in 1998, that in 10 years I would be a speechwriter for the first black president, I would never believe them,\u201d Keenan...", "title": "Obama\u2019s speechwriter, Northwestern alumnus Cody Keenan speaks on campus", "url": "http://dailynorthwestern.com/2016/05/05/campus/obamas-speechwriter-northwestern-alumnus-cody-keenan-speaks-on-campus/", "image": "http://dailynorthwestern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Keenan_Photo-by-Zack-Laurence_WEB-900x600.jpg", "type": "article"}, "robots": "follow, all", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "fb": {"admins": "10206467072817791,100000535384181", "app_id": 545410622222566}, "article": {"section": "Campus", "tag": "Admiral Weber Lecture,Arturo Brant,Cody Keenan,Sara Monoson"}, "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,maximum-scale=1.0", "description": "Northwestern University and Evanston's Only Daily News Source Since 1881"}, "article_summary": "\u201cI work for a guy who believes he can convince anyone with a rational mind that his policies will work,\u201d Keenan said.\nWhite House director of speechwriting Cody Keenan reflected on his personal experiences as President Barack Obama\u2019s lead speechwriter and as a Northwestern alumnus at a speaker event Wednesday evening.\nCody Keenan speaks about his experience as a speechwriter for President Obama.\nThe political science department invited Keenan because it thought his ties to NU would make him a particularly interesting speaker, Monoson said.\nWhen asked about the current state of U.S. politics, Keenan expressed concern over some of the presidential candidates and increased polarization, but said he is ultimately faithful in American democracy."}
