And I do think that they will try to micro-manage the market,\" said Craig Dismuke, chief economic strategist at Memphis-based broker dealer Vining Sparks.\n\nAfter 6.5 years of ultra easy monetary policy, Fed officials would welcome at least some evidence of tightening financial conditions as they increasingly telegraph a rate hike.\n\nThe concern is a repetition of 2013, when then-Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke set off a market rout that threatened the recovery when he suggested a stimulative bond-buying program could soon be curbed.\n\nInvestors and economists said that while the recent market move is on the Fed's radar, given its volatility, alarm would grow if the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield were to soon rise above 2.75 percent.\n\nRelated: Is the Air Coming Out of the Bond Market Bubble?\n\nSuch a tightening could imperil the all-important housing market, as it did during the so-called \"taper tantrum\" two years ago, which prompted a flurry of dovish speeches by Fed officials attempting to control the damage.\n\nAt the time, stock markets plunged and mortgage rates shot up to 4.8 percent, spooking home buyers. While today's economy does not face that sort of trouble, there are warning signs.\n\nA 30-year fixed mortgage averaged 4.17 percent last week, its highest level since November 2014, prompting a rush of applicants to lock in the rate before costs rise any more. The cost of new car loans is also edging higher, though from a record low in the fourth quarter of 2014.\n\nFed officials regularly highlight housing and autos as drivers of what is expected to be stronger consumer confidence and broader GDP growth in the second half of the year.\n\nRobust job gains suggests the rebound is underway, with Fed Chair Janet Yellen eyeing an initial rate hike this year and economists predicting it will come in September.\n\nYet U.S. productivity has mysteriously sagged and wages have not climbed as expected, leaving the economy fragile. Meanwhile, Fed Governor Daniel Tarullo has emphasized the central bank's long-simmering concern that markets may not be liquid enough to withstand a volatile selloff.\n\nRelated: IMF\u2019s Surprising Message to Yellen About Interest Rates\n\nThe sharp U.S. bond selloff is a response to sturdy U.S. economic data, as well as easing concerns over deflation across Europe, which has sent German benchmark Bunds tumbling too.\n\nAs Treasuries plunged last week, Tarullo was one of three influential Fed officials who sounded surprisingly cautious tones over raising rates. \"We do experience cross currents from abroad and they do affect our recovery and they affect the policy response,\" said Fed Governor Lael Brainard, who rarely discusses policy publicly.\n\nThe commentary could hint at the central bank's response if the selloff runs into the summer and continues to tighten conditions in the real economy. New York Fed President William Dudley has warned the Fed would tighten policy less aggressively if markets, including corporate debt, respond too much.\n\nTwo years ago, yields on investment-grade corporate bonds shot from a record-low 2.62 percent in early May to a high of 3.65 percent in early September, or 103 basis points.\n\nThis year, since a mid-April low-water mark of 2.84 percent, the yields have climbed to 3.38 percent, or 54 basis points. Junk bond yields have risen from 5.98 percent in mid-April to 6.46 percent.\n\n\"At this point, I don't think there has been enough move in broad financial conditions, including the 10-year yield, to cause the Fed to pause (rate hikes) for longer,\" said Peter Hooper, chief economist at Deutsche Bank Securities.\n\n\"This latest spate of dovishness is about keeping the foot on the accelerator until we see the data we're expecting.\"\n\nAdditional reporting by Dan Burns\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The sharp bond market selloff is starting to pinch American consumers and companies, c", "title": "Fed Could Delay Interest Rate Hike As Bonds Sell Off", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/06/14/Fed-Could-Delay-Interest-Rate-Hike-Bonds-Sell", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/markets-stocks_2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/06/14/Fed-Could-Delay-Interest-Rate-Hike-Bonds-Sell", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/markets-stocks_2.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "The sharp bond market selloff is starting to pinch American consumers and companies, c", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "After 6.5 years of ultra easy monetary policy, Fed officials would welcome at least some evidence of tightening financial conditions as they increasingly telegraph a rate hike.\nAs Treasuries plunged last week, Tarullo was one of three influential Fed officials who sounded surprisingly cautious tones over raising rates.\nFed officials regularly highlight housing and autos as drivers of what is expected to be stronger consumer confidence and broader GDP growth in the second half of the year.\nJunk bond yields have risen from 5.98 percent in mid-April to 6.46 percent.\nRelated: Is the Air Coming Out of the Bond Market Bubble?"}
