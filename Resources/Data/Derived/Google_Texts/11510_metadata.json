The salient conclusions are that while acute cannabis use does not produce fatal overdoses, there are many other hazards.\n\nFor example, the report says that deleterious outcomes of acute pot use are:\n\nDriving while cannabis-intoxicated doubles the risk of a car crash; this risk increases substantially if users are also alcohol-intoxicated.\n\n\n\nCannabis use during pregnancy slightly reduces birth weight of the baby.\n\nRegular cannabis users can develop a dependence syndrome, the risks of which are around one in ten of all cannabis users and one in six among those who start in adolescence.\n\n\n\n\n\nRegular cannabis users double their risks of experiencing psychotic symptoms and disorders, especially if they have a personal or family history of psychotic disorders, and if they start using cannabis in their mid-teens.\n\n\n\n\n\nRegular adolescent cannabis users have lower educational attainment than non-using peers, but we don\u2019t know whether the link is causal.\n\n\n\n\n\nRegular adolescent cannabis users are more likely to use other illicit drugs, but we don\u2019t know whether the link is causal.\n\n\n\n\n\nRegular cannabis use that begins in adolescence and continues throughout young adulthood appears to produce intellectual impairment, but the mechanism and reversibility of the impairment is unclear.\n\n\n\n\n\nRegular cannabis use in adolescence approximately doubles the risk of being diagnosed with schizophrenia or reporting psychotic symptoms in adulthood.\n\n\n\n\n\nRegular cannabis smokers have a higher risk of developing chronic bronchitis.\n\nIt also states that among the detrimental effects of chronic marijuana use are:\n\n\u201cThere remains no compelling evidence that using marijuana causes the mental health and social problems discussed in the report,\" said Mason Tvert, director of communications of the Marijuana Policy Project in Denver. responded. \"It simply shows that teens who are prone to developing these problems are the ones most likely to break the law and try marijuana. It\u2019s a case of correlation, not causation.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"contentType": "article", "layout": "main", "description": "A recently completed study of 20 years of research on cannabis use dismantled many of arguments pot proponents use to bolster their cause.", "author": "Michael P.
