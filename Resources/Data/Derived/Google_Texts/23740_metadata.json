Brandon Johnson of Denver finished a close second in 25:02.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a beast,\u201d Johnson said.\n\nDahlberg, who was an All-American at Western State, said he and Johnson \u201crolled together\u201d for the first couple of miles before Dahlberg began to pull away. Johnson finished about 100 meters behind on streets riddled with puddles.\n\n\u201cOn a day like today, you just get out and run hard,\u201d said Dahlberg, 30. \u201cIt\u2019s not really necessarily about the time, just trying to get in a hard effort and competing. Brandon and I battled for a while and he never let up. It was a fun day, regardless of the rain and wind. It was nice to get out here.\u201d\n\nNell Rojas won the women\u2019s five-miler in 29:48. Her father, Ric, won the first Bolder Boulder in 1979, when he was one of America\u2019s top road racers. She spent much of 2014 pursuing elite triathlon as a career, but gave that up two weeks ago to concentrate on running.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a lot of time, a lot of money, and I didn\u2019t have that need to do it anymore,\u201d said Rojas, 27. \u201cI wanted to enjoy life a little bit. I did have success, and I\u2019m very confident that I could be really great, but in five years. That\u2019s a long time and a lot of sacrifice.\u201d\n\nTaylor Garrett of Denver won the men\u2019s 10-miler in 56:52 on his 26th birthday. It was a little bittersweet because he will soon leave the thriving Front Range running scene to take a job for a nonprofit in New York City.\n\n\u201cThis is like my last hurrah,\u201d Garrett said. \u201cI\u2019m going to miss it.\u201d\n\nKristin Louderback of Highlands Ranch won the women\u2019s 10-miler in 1:03:55, edging Nicole Chyr of Englewood by 14 seconds in the closest race of the day.\n\nAndy Rinne and Alexis Wilbert, both of Colorado Springs, were the winners in the 5K. Rinne finished in 17:14, Wilbert in 18:20.\n\nJohn Meyer: jmeyer@denverpost.com or twitter.com/johnmeyer", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Rain, wind fail to put damper on Cherry Creek Sneak road race", "title": "Rain, wind fail to put damper on Cherry Creek Sneak road race", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/04/26/rain-wind-fail-to-put-damper-on-cherry-creek-sneak-road-race/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150426__CDSNEAKPHOTO_2JL8890xp1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150426__CDSNEAKPHOTO_2JL8890xp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-04-26T13:58:28+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-24T20:01:53+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Running"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcae79\"", "article_summary": "Scott Dahlberg, an assistant track and cross country coach at Colorado State, won in 24 minutes, 43 seconds.\nJohnson finished about 100 meters behind on streets riddled with puddles.\nThis year it meant rain \u2014 sometimes coming in drenching downpours \u2014 as last year\u2019s winners in the five-mile main event repeated.\nThat\u2019s a long time and a lot of sacrifice.\u201dTaylor Garrett of Denver won the men\u2019s 10-miler in 56:52 on his 26th birthday.\nAndy Rinne and Alexis Wilbert, both of Colorado Springs, were the winners in the 5K."}
