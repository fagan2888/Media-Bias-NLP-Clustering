But the thing is that in growing a restaurant specifically, you have to get to a point where you are either big or small or you have the money to go big,\u201d Grossman said. \u201cSo what I plan and figure to do is to take a step back, avoid the 2016 health care coverage and overtime issues, and then wait for an investor to say \u2018OK, we are going to do 30 restaurants. Let\u2019s do it.\u2019 Because that is where it is at.\u201d\n\nGrossman, who used to work at Bojangles and Taco Bell, said he looks to how businesses like these avoid paying health care and overtime benefits and prefers being a small business that supports its employees instead of relying on part-time help.\n\n\u201cThat is how everyone is getting around it, by making everyone part-time,\u201d Grossman said. \u201cLooking at everything, it made more sense to cut one of the restaurants off, focus on our current two restaurants and be able to grow from there.\u201d\n\nWhile Grossman is sympathetic to the government\u2019s concerns over a living wage and responsible overtime payments, he is bothered by the speed of implementation. He also is concerned about the ability of his restaurant to transition between small business and successful chain in a regulatory environment that makes that transition more difficult.\n\n\u201cWe are trying to adapt to the new governmental structures and laws. We want to be compliant, we don\u2019t want to try and fly under the radar and get busted two years from now,\" Grossman said. \"I\u2019ve always been honest in business and honest with my employees and really we are just trying to take a step back and get ready for a super expansion. That is where we really want to be.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Citing requirements of Obamacare, owner Ellis Grossman of\u00a0the Charleston-based organic restaurant Black Bean Co. has decided to close one of his three locations.", "author": "Palmetto Business Daily Reports", "og": {"url": "http://palmettobusinessdaily.com/stories/510642181-black-bean-co-blames-location-s-closure-on-obamacare", "image": "https://jnswire.s3.amazonaws.com/jns-media/45/1c/119015/large_chef-black-bean-co.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Citing requirements of Obamacare,   owner Ellis Grossman of\u00a0the Charleston-based organic restaurant Black Bean Co. has decided to close one of his three locations.", "title": "Black Bean Co. blames location's closure on Obamacare"}, "twitter": {"site": "@Palmettobiz", "image": "https://jnswire.s3.amazonaws.com/jns-media/45/1c/119015/large_chef-black-bean-co.jpg", "description": "Citing requirements of Obamacare,   owner Ellis Grossman of\u00a0the Charleston-based organic restaurant Black Bean Co. has decided to close one of his three locations.", "card": "summary", "title": "Black Bean Co. blames location's closure on Obamacare"}, "articleid": 510642181, "keywords": "south carolina business news, palmetto business news, south carolina policy news, palmetto policy news", "article": {"author": "http://palmettobusinessdaily.com/author/palmetto-business-daily-reports", "modified": "2015-10-13", "published": "2015-10-13"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Citing requirements of Obamacare, owner Ellis Grossman of the Charleston-based organic restaurant Black Bean Co. has decided to close one of his three locations.\nHe also is concerned about the ability of his restaurant to transition between small business and successful chain in a regulatory environment that makes that transition more difficult.\n\"I\u2019ve always been honest in business and honest with my employees and really we are just trying to take a step back and get ready for a super expansion.\nWe want to be compliant, we don\u2019t want to try and fly under the radar and get busted two years from now,\" Grossman said.\n\u201cThat is how everyone is getting around it, by making everyone part-time,\u201d Grossman said."}
