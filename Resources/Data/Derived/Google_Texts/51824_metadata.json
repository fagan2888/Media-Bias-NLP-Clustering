By investing his own money to see what works and doesn't work, Philly Pretzel Factory locations, which originally were only stand-alone stores, can now be found in transportation and entertainment venues, and in the nation's largest retailer, Walmart. Its first grocery location opened last month inside a Shop Rite located at 2358 Cheltenham Ave., in Philadelphia.\n\nContinuing down this path of curiosity, DiZio recently opened the first Philly Pretzel Factory location inside a grocery store as a part of a larger expansion plan for the brand into grocery stores.\n\nPhilly Pretzel Factory was founded in 1998, by college buddies DiZio and Len Lehman, and has grown into the largest Philly-style pretzel bakery in the world. It feeds customers at more than 150-franchised locations primarily in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic, expanding from New York to Florida. Philly Pretzel Factory's menu offers the traditional Philly-style pretzel and also includes pretzel twists, mini pretzels, rivets, pretzel dogs, cheesesteak pretzels and a variety of mustards. Its products can be found in a stand-alone bakery,\n\nQSRWeb chatted with DiZio to find out how and why he opted to open a unit inside a grocery store.\n\nQ: When and why did Philly Pretzel Factory begin expanding into transportation and entertainment venues \u2014 airports, train stations, stadiums, etc.?\n\nDiZio: Within a few years after opening our flagship store. We knew we had a simple and scalable franchise concept and wanted to expand. We started at the Frankford Terminal location in Philadelphia and expanded from there.\n\nQ: When and why did it expand into a grocery story? What store is it and where is it?\n\nDiZio: I've noticed that there has been a trend in franchising of small, scalable franchise concepts in non-traditional venues such as Walmart. Grocery markets appear to be a logical location for a small pretzel bakery as customers are there for food and could go home with a bag of fresh, hot Philly pretzels.\n\nQ: Are there plans to expand into additional grocery stores/chains or other nontraditional locations?\n\nDiZio: Yes. We are currently looking at other grocery opportunities and are always open to other types of non-traditional locations.\n\nQ: What drives your approach to this concept?\n\nDiZio: Giving the customer a great pretzel, which turns into a great experience and a great memory.\n\nQ: Was it cheaper to open in a grocery store than a traditional location?\n\nDiZio: Yes, it is, because of a smaller footprint, rent overhead and build out are all a lot less expensive. Basically, the shell is already there, so we don't need to start from scratch.\n\nQ: What was the startup cost?\n\nDiZio: It was very minimal. We already had a lot of extra equipment that we used in this store, so we don't have an exact number for the start-up.\n\nQ: What's been the ROI?\n\nDiZio: It's been good, based on the first two questions we just discussed, and the foot traffic has been very high. Because people are around food, to grab a quick snack from Philly Pretzel Factory is definitely on their minds.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A QSR can work in a nontraditional venue.
