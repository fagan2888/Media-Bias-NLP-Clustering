Originally set to begin in 2014, the employer mandate has been delayed until 2015 or 2016, depending on the employer's size.\n\nThis article reviews what businesses, health insurance professionals, and CPAs need to know about the employer mandate for 2015.\n\nSmall Employers (< 50 FTEs) - No Employer Mandate\n\nSmall employers with fewer than 50 FTE employees are exempt from the employer mandate and penalties.\n\nIn other words, small employers with fewer than 50 employees have no requirement to offer traditional health insurance coverage and are not subject to the employer shared responsibility penalties.\n\nMid-Size Employers (50 - 99 FTEs) - Transition Relief Available\n\n2015 is a \"phase-in\" year for the employer mandate, as there is transition relief available for some employers with 50-99 full-time equivalent (FTE) employees.\n\nLarger Employers (100+ FTEs) - Employer Mandate Starting in 2015, with Leeway\n\nLarger businesses (100+ FTEs), most of whom already offer health benefits, are subject to the employer mandate and penalties starting in 2015. However, there is leeway for 2015.\n\nIn 2015, larger businesses will satisfy the employer mandate if they offer coverage to 70% of full time employees in 2015 and 95% in 2016.\n\nTo summarize, for 2015:\n\nThe employer mandate only applies to employers with 100+ FTE employees.\n\nThe employer is subject to the fee if they do not offer minimum essential, affordable coverage to at least 70% of full-time employees.\n\nThe Employer Shared Responsibility Fee is equal to the number of full-time employees the employer employed for the month (minus 80) multiplied by 1/12 of $2,000, provided that at least one full-time employee receives a premium tax credit/subsidy for that month.\n\nAdditional Resources on the Employer Mandate\n\nFor background on the employer mandate, see:", "article_metadata": {"description": "Employer mandate for 2015.
