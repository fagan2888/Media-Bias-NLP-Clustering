He also offered a strong defense of the law and the president.\n\n\u201cAll of this noise and back and forth and anger and rage is being directed at somebody that\u2019s just trying to make sure you have health insurance. Can you believe it?\u201d\n\nReed called out state leaders in a general way for not doing their part to educate the public about the law. However, Reed stopped short of criticizing Gov. Nathan Deal, who opted out of a state-based exchange and rejected the law\u2019s Medicaid expansion.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to try to persuade the governor to believe something that he\u2019s never going to believe. And he doesn\u2019t try to persuade me that I shouldn\u2019t support the Affordable Care Act,\u201d said Reed.\n\nGeorgia\u2019s health exchange, which can be found on the web at healthcare.gov, went online October 1, but remains plagued by technical issues.\n\nAnd then there's consumers' familiarity with the exchanges, or more accurately, their lack of familiarity.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know any of this was going on,\" says City of Atlanta employee Pamela Hicks as she stands beside an information table full of Obamacare pamphlets and information cards. \"I didn\u2019t know you\u2019d get penalized if you didn\u2019t have insurance.\"\n\nHicks says she pays about $200 a month for her Kaiser Permanente family plan, an amount she finds \"reasonable.\"\n\nToday, she asks questions so she can talk about the law with uninsured friends and family.\n\n\u201cBasically what I\u2019m doing is passing on the information to people I know use the emergency room for treatment, for basic treatment,\" she says.\n\nNavigator Alecia Distin walks Hicks through the exchange process. She's able to quickly answer Hicks' questions because she says most people ask the same ones.\n\n\u201cWhat are the premiums going to be like? How much is this going ot cost me out of pocket? If I don\u2019t like my job insurance can I go to the marketplace?\"\n\nAnswering questions is all Distin can do for now.\n\nShe\u2019s met all federal navigator requirements, but Georgia has its own test. And until the state issues her license, she can\u2019t legally help people enroll.\n\nDistin expects to have her state license in-hand within the next week or so.\n\nGeorgia has certified 17 navigators as of Wednesday, up from just three one week ago.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Local", "description": "The city of Atlanta hosted an event Wednesday promoting Georgias new insurance exchange as called for by President Obamas health reform law.
