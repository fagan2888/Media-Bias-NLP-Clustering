Insurance companies and the government will spend billions more on health care if House Republicans prevail in their lawsuit against the Obama administration’s reform law, according to a report released Wednesday by the Urban Institute.

The report examines one possible outcome of the House v. Burwell case, which will decide the legality of payments the government made to help insurance companies recoup the costs of covering people making less than 250 percent of the federal poverty level. The payments helped alleviate the costs of deductibles, copayments or coinsurance for enrollees, but, because Congress didn’t make a specific appropriation for the funds, Republicans say they were illegally distributed and that the case represents another example of President Barack Obama’s executive overreach.
