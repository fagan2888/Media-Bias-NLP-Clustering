Michael S. Williamson/The Washington Post\n\nWith the resignation of state Sen. Phillip P. Puckett, the GOP gained control of the state senate and could doom Gov. Terry McAuliffe\u2019s move to expand Medicaid. In a region where the decline of the coal industry has sent poverty and health-care needs soaring, another force has grown by at least equal measures: antipathy to President Obama and the Affordable Care Act.\n\nIn Trammel, Va., Maggie Charles, at left in doorway, who pays her own medical costs and wouldn\u2019t have it otherwise, and James Kinney, who gets help from a clinic, are among those whom Medicaid expansion might have helped.\n\nIn Trammel, Va., Maggie Charles, at left in doorway, who pays her own medical costs and wouldn\u2019t have it otherwise, and James Kinney, who gets help from a clinic, are among those whom Medicaid expansion might have helped.\n\n\u2014 Carolyn Underwood remembers her dad coming home covered in black coal dust from the mines. \u201cMomma would have his water ready. He\u2019d wash his face and she would wash his neck,\u201d she said.\n\nIn old age, he suffered from black lung disease and wore an oxygen supply constantly. But unlike his daughter, he never worried about how he would pay his medical bills. The union took care of it.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t make Carolyn Underwood, 63, a supporter of expanded government health coverage, even though she would benefit from it. In a region where the decline of the coal industry has sent poverty and health-care needs soaring, another force has grown at least by equal measures: antipathy to President Obama and the Affordable Care Act (ACA).\n\n\u201cI am scared of Obamacare,\u201d Underwood said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been hearing too many tales about it. We heard there\u2019s doctors who get to decide . . . \u201d Before she could put her finger on the term \u201cdeath panels,\u201d her sister Nancy Taylor, 62, made a gun gesture with her hand and said, \u201cPow!\u201d\n\nThat sort of sentiment has drawn new attention this month, after a Democratic state senator from Southwest Virginia resigned his seat, giving Republicans the majority they need to pass a state budget without new health coverage for 400,000 poor residents.\n\nPhillip P. Puckett, first elected 17 years ago before his corner of Virginia turned deep red, supported expansion under the Affordable Care Act in part because so many of his constituents \u2014 more than 20,000 \u2014 would have qualified. But many voters in Russell County do not share his view.\n\nThe region\u2019s politics, in fact, help to explain the juxtaposition of Virginia\u2019s conservative, Republican-controlled legislature with an increasingly purple state that voted twice for Obama. Residents here generally don\u2019t feel betrayed by Puckett\u2019s resignation, even though it resulted from a deal with Republicans that included the prospect of government jobs for him and his daughter. Puckett\u2019s seat will almost certainly go to the GOP in an upcoming special election, but his former constituents are either ambivalent about what the change in representation means for their health benefits, or they don\u2019t know or don\u2019t care.\n\nTipping the scales of power\n\nWhat will happen to Medicaid expansion remains unclear. What is clear is that widespread antipathy to the health-care law, Puckett\u2019s resignation and the series of events it prompted seem to have provoked a far greater uproar outside Southwest Virginia than inside.\n\nPuckett ran unsuccessfully for the Democratic nomination for lieutenant governor in 2005. This month, he became a traitor to some Democrats when his resignation delivered Senate Republicans a one-vote majority and the upper hand in a fight that has paralyzed the General Assembly for a year.\n\nAt the time of his resignation, Republicans arranged for Puckett to be offered a job at the Virginia Tobacco Indemnification and Community Revitalization Commission \u2014 he has since withdrawn his name from consideration \u2014 and a full-time judgeship for his daughter. Federal investigators are now probing the circumstances surrounding Puckett\u2019s resignation and the potential offer of jobs to him and his daughter.\n\nThe Senate and House had been locked in a budget standoff, with the Senate supporting a budget that included Medicaid expansion and the House supporting a plan that did not.\n\nBut after Puckett resigned, Senate Republicans used their newfound power to pass a budget last week that stripped out Medicaid expansion. The House quickly followed, sending the budget to the desk of Gov. Terry McAuliffe (D), who has until Sunday to decide what to do. If he vetoes the bill and no budget is in place by July 1, Virginia\u2019s government could shut down. If he tries to implement Medicaid without legislative approval, as his administration has looked into doing, he could prompt a historic legal battle over executive power.\n\nIn his first interview since resigning, Puckett, a banker from rural Russell County who lives closer to Tennessee, West Virginia and Kentucky than to Richmond or Washington, said he is keenly aware of the reverberations of his decision.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t do anything without talking to the Lord about it or without consulting with my family,\u201d Puckett told the Voice, a weekly newspaper in Buchanan and Tazewell counties. \u201cThis was the hardest political decision I\u2019ve ever made. The timing is never good in doing this.\u201d\n\nYet, it is the advocates for Medicaid expansion \u2014 not the residents of Puckett\u2019s district \u2014 who say the timing couldn\u2019t be worse for former constituents who would qualify for expanded coverage.\n\n\u201cWhile the legislature\u2019s talking about what they\u2019re talking about, people die,\u201d said Teresa Gardner, executive director of a mobile clinic called the Health Wagon, where Underwood goes for free care. \u201cThat\u2019s what they don\u2019t understand.\u201d\n\nWaving off shenanigans\n\nLeaving the Health Wagon, T.O. Mullens, 59, of Wise County said he\u2019s been driving a coal truck for 35 years and now works on a mountaintop mine, or a \u201cstrip job.\u201d Although he has insurance, the clinic helps him afford the 11 medications he takes for high blood pressure, diabetes, ulcers, kidney stones, gallstones and lungs \u201cfull of coal dust,\u201d said Mullens, who sports a bushy white beard.\n\n\u201cWe are in a very poor area. Rich with natural resources \u2014 the landscape,\u201d he said, motioning to the mountains that provide a verdant backdrop to widespread suffering. \u201cBut doctors don\u2019t want to come back here because of the economy.\u201d\n\nPuckett\u2019s former district stretches 150 miles from Radford to Big Stone Gap. Rail cars filled to the brim with coal leave a coating of soot on windows, and stone memorials proudly display the names of those killed in the mines.\n\nAbout 20 percent of the population lives below the poverty line, compared with 11 percent in the rest of Virginia, census data shows. In parts of the district, unemployment reached nearly 10 percent in April, nearly twice the statewide average.\n\nIn the coal camp town of Trammel, an isolated strip of modest homes built by Virginia Banner Coal for its miners, 78-year-old Maggie Charles passed the afternoon selling paperback books and clothes on her stoop. Only the occasional visitor stops, she said.\n\nLike many people here, she waved off the political shenanigans in Richmond and didn\u2019t see what it had do to with her day-to-day life. \u201cI don\u2019t go to the doctor. I don\u2019t take no medicines,\u201d said Charles, who survives on Social Security and her late husband\u2019s black lung benefits.\n\nJames Kinney carted his portable oxygen tank down the street to see what Charles was hawking. Asked whether he was aware of Puckett\u2019s resignation, Kinney provided a rare perspective when he said: \u201cOf course. That boy done screwed a lot of folks up here.\u201d\n\nKinney said he felt lucky to have health insurance for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, known as COPD, which he developed after years of hauling and shoveling coal, but said the 20 percent he pays out of pocket is still a burden.\n\nA few houses down, a woman whose only job is overseeing a table covered in a hodgepodge of clocks, hats and ceramic figures said she pays all her medical expenses out of pocket and wouldn\u2019t have it any other way. She can get generic blood pressure medicine cheap, but her anxiety pills cost $192.50 a month, she said.\n\nShe and her husband, who works security but receives no benefits, would rather pay a penalty for being uninsured than participate in Obamacare, said the woman, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because she was talking about her medical conditions.\n\n\u201cI refused to go there because I didn\u2019t feel it was the government\u2019s place to tell you where you have to get health care. I want to go to the doctor of my own choice,\u201d she said, adding that she doesn\u2019t trust the president. \u201cI think he has actually lied to the people about a lot of things.\u201d\n\n\u2018Can\u2019t teach people to care\u2019\n\nThat attitude fueled decisive defeats for Obama in this region in both elections. In 2008, Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) lost purple Virginia by 7 percent, but he won Puckett\u2019s former district by an 18-point margin. Four years later, former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney won 67 percent of the vote, carrying the district with a whopping 36-point lead.\n\nIt is also the mind-set that in 2010 helped unseat then-Rep. Rick Boucher, a 14-term incumbent Democrat from Southwest Virginia\u2019s 9th District who supported the coal industry and opposed the ACA \u2014 but lost anyway.\n\n\u201cMany people will cast votes that are contrary to certain interests that those individuals have. I think oftentimes it is the image that a party has in a region or that a party has in a person\u2019s mind that leads a person to vote in a certain way,\u201d Boucher said in a phone interview from the K Street offices of the law firm Sidley Austin, where he heads a government strategies group. He goes home to Abingdon on the weekends.\n\nBack in coal country, apathy and a lack of faith in politicians are free-flowing commodities alongside the ever-present demand for better health care.\n\nThe Health Wagon greets patients with signs that alternately hearten, \u201cWith God all things are possible,\u201d and warn, \u201cNo guns, knives or weapons of any kind allowed on premises.\u201d\n\nThe clinic treats Curtis Hash, 59, of Norton with monthly shots of vitamin B12 to alleviate absentmindedness that was causing the certified electrician to misplace tools.\n\nWith no insurance, Hash can be blindsided by bills. After a car accident in April, emergency-room doctors ordered $7,000 in X-rays \u2014 unaware that his auto insurance covered only $5,000 in medical bills. \u201cThey found I had a sinus infection,\u201d Hash said. \u201cA $2,000 sinus infection.\u201d\n\nStill, Hash said he feels lucky to have steady work and doesn\u2019t expect elected officials to do more than talk when it comes to health care and the disproportionate need of the medically underserved population that had sent Puckett back to Richmond for 16 years.\n\nHe said politicians are all the same. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter who\u2019s in there,\u201d he said, the bags under his eyes deepening. \u201cYou can\u2019t teach people to care.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Medicaid, Phillip Puckett, Health Wagon, Norton, Wise, Lebanon, President Obama", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "A senator\u2019s surprise resignation blocked efforts to expand health care, but voters don\u2019t know or don\u2019t care.", "title": "In Southwest Va., antipathy to the Affordable Care Act collides with poverty and the health needs of residents", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/virginia-politics/in-southwest-va-health-needs-poverty-collide-with-antipathy-to-the-affordable-care-act/2014/06/19/4890bf8c-f4e7-11e3-9861-8dc65df15e56_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2014/06/17/Others/Images/2014-06-17/Puckett141403013250.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@jennaportnoy"}, "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "Medicaid, Phillip Puckett, Health Wagon, Norton, Wise, Lebanon, President Obama", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost"}, "eomportal-uuid": "4890bf8c-f4e7-11e3-9861-8dc65df15e56", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "description": "A senator\u2019s surprise resignation blocked efforts to expand health care, but voters don\u2019t know or don\u2019t care."}, "article_summary": "Asked if he was aware of state Sen.
