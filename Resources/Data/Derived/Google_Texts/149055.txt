MURRYSVILLE, Pa. (AP) — Several people were stabbed Wednesday morning at a high school near Pittsburgh, and a suspect was taken into custody, an emergency official said.

Dan Stevens, the spokesman for Westmoreland County emergency management, said five or six people were reported stabbed at about 7:20 a.m. at Franklin Regional High School in Murrysville, about 15 miles east of Pittsburgh.

It wasn’t immediately clear if the suspect and the victims are students, adults or a mix of both. It doesn’t appear that any of the victims suffered life-threatening injuries, Stevens said, though several helicopters were seen flying people from the scene to area hospitals.

School officials and Murrysville police didn’t immediately return calls seeking further details, but the school issued a bulletin on its website saying: “A critical incident has occurred at the high school. All elementary schools are canceled, the middle school and high school students are secure.”
