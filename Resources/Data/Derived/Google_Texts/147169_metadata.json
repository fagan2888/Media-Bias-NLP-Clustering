God, these days? Are you nuts? \u201cThink what times these are,\u201d Saul Bellow wrote\u2014a generation ago; it\u2019s worse today. How, against a contemporary background, do you contemplate the almighty? Who believes there\u2019s an oasis in 2015\u2019s scattered metaphysical sand?\n\nBut I had a reason to search. A few years ago my 3-year-old son couldn\u2019t rise from bed unaided, his walk was a limp. Our pediatrician frowned when breaking the news: Rheumatoid arthritis. And in that shiver of change I glimpsed, for my son, for me, a long line of vanishing possibilities. (The disease was most likely permanent.) And it was the same old dumb supplicant\u2019s story. Gulped tears, inhibition, begging made ritual. Please, please, God\u2014the tonality of fraudulence. Because how could I (secular, religiously illiterate I) talk to God? What could be said that wouldn\u2019t embarrass my intelligence, or His (presuming I actually believed)?\n\nThis was a new feeling. I\u2019ve been a writer my entire adult life, but I didn\u2019t have any language. At the moment it really mattered, whatever fluency I\u2019d had came pretty much to zilch \u2014 to smoke and cobwebs.\n\nAnd yet now my son was in bad shape. And so I asked God to help him. And my son got well, in an almost miraculous fashion. It happened in an unlikely way: A stranger\u2019s advice, skeptical doctors, a full recovery. (My wife wrote about it for the Times.) This ecstatic surprise struck from me a real desire to thank, and to understand, and to believe more fully, in God. I prayed\u2014self-invented, unschooled prayers\u2014and I did nothing more than that. I did nothing, that is, to further my understanding, or even to deepen my thoughts about God, or belief in Him.\n\nTwo years later, my wife found herself \u2014 a lapsed Presbyterian \u2014 diagnosed with an invasive melanoma. Time, again, to ask for mercy. I began going to temple. Or, I tried to. I\u2019d visit synagogues and hear rabbis and I found all of it off-putting.\n\nBut I was thirsting after guidance. That\u2019s what it felt like, a need, centered in the throat. This is a universal deal, of course. Trouble = need. As it is with most of us, it is with me. I\u2019m better suited to searching for answers than to the mundane facts of participatory worship. But next to my wife in bed, I felt like an ant colony: So many little black questions in me, hopes and doubts, crawling every which way.\n\nAnd then, somehow, a second time, my prayer was answered. My wife after a succinct surgery was given a clean bill of health.\n\nThis set in train a search. I needed to find out more about God. Can you have faith today and remain a thinking person?\n\nI approached religious leaders: Riverside Church\u2019s first Minister of Social Justice; the president of a Jesuit university; the head rabbi of Brooklyn\u2019s leading reform congregations; a renowned Buddhist, etc. I wanted only to have a back-and-forth about how to believe \u2014 a heavily secular Jew and a number of influential faith-thinkers, hashing out the how of it, discussing whether religion can work in a digital age, to be published in an epistolary way.\n\nWhat follows is the first of these exchanges\u2014my interaction with Erik Kolbell, who looks like a bearded (handsomer) Will Ferrell, and is just as likable. He\u2019s also a brilliant guy\u2014a writer, psychotherapist, Yale Divinity School graduate, and ordained minister, and the first Minister of Social Justice at Riverside Church in New York City. (I became aware of him when I saw him on Charlie Rose talking about his inspired book \u201cWhat Jesus Meant: The Beatitudes and a Meaningful Life.\u201d)\n\nKolbell sat waiting for me in the chosen restaurant, a hand-written sign, scrawled in rickety ink, propped on his glass. \u201cERIK KOLBELL.\u201d When he smiled there was a certain Muppetish softness to the mouth \u2014ah! Here you are, sit, sit\u2014 a smile almost comic in its munificence, in its knowledge that munificence is, nowadays, a pretty rare article of trade.\n\nWhat follows is a transcript of our written correspondence. The questions are mine, the answers are his.\n\nOne of the things I was struck by when I went to services\u2014Reform Jewish, Presbyterian and Catholic\u2014was how much time was spent, in elegant ways, asking for things. Generally, these were inoffensive and general things. -Please protect us, oh Lord.- But that gave me pause just the same. How can we\u2014a comfortable New York flock, for example\u2014ask for anything, when we know there are so many who have it worse than we do?\n\nI share your quandary on this issue, Darin, not only because it invites selfishness at the expense of compassion, but because it runs the risk of promoting an unhealthy understanding of the relationship between the individual and God. Even asking for innocent things, such as good health, suggests a kind of magical thinking that I don\u2019t necessarily subscribe to. If I can pray to God for health, then why not wealth as well? And if so, is God then simply being defined as a dispenser of goods and blessings? A generous grandfather, pockets stuffed with candy, eager to dole it out if only we ask nicely? Rather, by way of prayer, I am fond of the first three words of Psalm 119:36, which read simply \u201cIncline my heart\u2026\u201d For my money, this is what we can justly ask of God; that our consciousness of God is such that our hearts are inclined toward those things that promote personal integration, deepened faith, human justice and universal mercy. In answer, then, to the question you pose below, with the Bellow quote, I believe prayer is the endeavor on the part of the individual (or the community) to dispose ourselves to a deepening consciousness of what God might want of us in order that these things \u2014 integration, faith, justice and mercy \u2014 are made manifest in our lives.", "article_metadata": {"description": "I was a skeptic, until my son and wife got sick and suddenly faith in something seemed important.
