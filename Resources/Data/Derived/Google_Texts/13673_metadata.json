Through the iPhone app, users can access over four hundred thousand rated restaurant menus, the largest database of health rated restaurant menus, which includes local restaurants, helping users choose healthier foods. The nutrition and fitness app also includes the ability to track food, exercise, and weight.\n\nAccording to the 2011 \u2013 2012 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), 69% of adults in the United States are categorized as overweight or obese, one of the highest rates in the world. With nearly 50% of food expenditures occurring away from the home, it has become crucial to help people make better food choices in restaurants in order to improve public health. The Affordable Care Act will require chain restaurants to make nutrition information available to their customers; however, the majority of restaurants will not fall under this requirement and will not have nutritional information available.\n\nJoinTheChallenge has rated over 23 million items from restaurants across the county. Using just food names and descriptions, like those found on restaurant menus, JoinTheChallenge users can see how foods are rated, even when nutritional information is not available. In addition to viewing rated restaurant menus, the app includes a \u201cFood Rater\u201d that allows users to rate custom foods or foods cooked at home. The iPhone app, which has a 30-day free trial and costs only $9.99 per month thereafter, also allows consumers to keep a journal of their food choices. \u201cWe want to provide our users with the easiest way to make healthier food choices. By eating foods rated green, and replacing foods rated red, users can improve the nutritional profile of their diet,\u201d says co-founder Ben Sakhai.\n\nJoinTheChallenge is not the first to use a traffic light food rating system to highlight the healthfulness of foods. Past studies have shown consumers find nutrition labels confusing and difficult, making simpler systems imperative. In restaurants, consumers and dieticians consistently underestimate the calories in meals. Alternatively, simple traffic light systems, like JoinTheChallenge\u2019s, outperformed other systems in helping consumers identify healthier products.\n\nIn January 2014, Massachusetts General Hospital published a study researching the long-term impact of a traffic light system after its cafeteria implemented its own red-yellow-green food rating system. By labeling cafeteria foods and beverages with respective color ratings and making green choices more visible, the cafeteria increased sales of green choices while decreasing sales of red choices, without customers reverting to their previously unhealthy choices, even after two years.\n\nA recent study on JoinTheChallenge\u2019s food rating system showed that, with respect to food items from twenty popular fast-food chains that are included in the JoinTheChallenge system, green rated foods were significantly lower than yellow rated foods which in turn were significantly lower than red rated foods for calories, calories from fat, total fat, saturated fat, and carbohydrates. The results showed foods rated red (244.3 calories/100g) had more than 60% more calories than foods rated green (151.2 calories/100g). With these results, the study concluded that the JoinTheChallenge proprietary traffic light food rating system has the potential to direct users to foods that are likely to help reduce their risk of heart disease, high blood pressure, stroke, and has the potential to improve nutrition and public health.\n\nAbout JoinTheChallenge:\n\nJoinTheChallenge (www.jointhechallenge.com) is a New York technology company founded in 2011.
