Attorney David Niose, representing the parents and the American Humanist Association (AHA), stated that "children every morning are pledging their national unity and loyalty in an indoctrinating format, in a way that validates God belief as truly patriotic and actually invalidates atheism."

Niose argued that some children are therefore "denied meaningful participation in this patriotic exercise."Several failed challenges to the Pledge have been made in the past, including Elk Grove Unified School District, et al. v.
