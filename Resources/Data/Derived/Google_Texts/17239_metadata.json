Emanuel Cleaver (D-MO), the former chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus from 2011 to 2013, has a message for you tea partiers: You can\u2019t rob women of their rights or reinstate racial segregation, no matter how badly you would like that. Many will be shocked to learn that any of this is part of the conservative agenda, but Cleaver knows you better than you know yourselves.\n\nSpeaking at a meeting of Palm Beach County Democrats this month, Cleaver closed his speech by recounting what he said was a common refrain from conservative Americans who opposed the Affordable Care Act in 2009: \u201cWe want our country back.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, you can\u2019t have it!\u201d Cleaver exclaimed to the laughs and applause of his audience.\n\nConservatives who insisted that they wanted their country back in the early period of the Obama administration was a regular source of alarm for conspiratorial and paranoid liberals. Many on the left insisted that what conservatives really meant was the return of Jim Crow and racial segregation. Where that pathological mistrust came from remains a mystery, but it was a charge that even Attorney General Eric Holder repeated.\n\n\u201cYou know, people talking about taking their country back,\u201d the nation\u2019s chief law enforcement official told ABC News. \u201cThere\u2019s a certain racial component to this for some people. I don\u2019t think this is the thing that is a main driver, but for some there\u2019s a racial animus.\u201d\n\nOf course, the left saw no depravity in former Vermont Gov. Howard Dean, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Democratic strategists James Carville and Paul Begala, Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-NY), and The Nation editor Katrina Vanden Heuvel issuing the same call to action. Apparently, the wickedness inherent in this phrase was harder to discern when those appealing to it were liberals.\n\nIt is a testament to Cleaver\u2019s laziness that he continues to insist that it is somehow racist to oppose the Affordable Care Act despite the fact that this notion was debunked years ago. But honesty and circumspection was not Cleaver\u2019s goal in this speech. He set out to irresponsibly agitate his audience.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going back to a day when we were segregated,\u201d Cleaver insisted, still castigating the imaginary tea partier in his mind. \u201cWe\u2019re not going back to a day when women were considered secondary citizens. We\u2019re not going back. No, you can\u2019t have it back.\u201d\n\nWatch the clip below via BuzzFeed\u2019s Andrew Kaczynski:\n\nCleaver is indulging in a bit of overcompensation for the fact that Democrats were the party on the wrong side of history on both of these issues.\n\nFrom 1868 to 1948, 20 Democratic Party governing platforms either supported racial segregation or failed to denounce it. Jim Crow laws that were passed in the solidly Democratic South following the collapse of Reconstruction were supported by Democratic lawmakers. \u201cThese laws segregated public schools, public transportation, restaurants, rest rooms and public places in general (everything from water coolers to beaches),\u201d Jeffrey Lord wrote for The Wall Street Journal. \u201cThe reason Rosa Parks became famous is that she sat in the \u2018whites only\u2019 front section of a bus, the \u2018whites only\u2019 designation the direct result of Democrats.\u201d\n\nIn fact, he noted that the Democratic Party\u2019s effort in 2008 to recast itself a historic champion of the rights of African-Americans glossed over a variety of checkered moments from the party\u2019s past:\n\nThere is no reference [on the DNC website\u2019s section on \u201cparty history\u201d] to the Democrats\u2019 1904 platform, which devotes a section to \u201cSectional and Racial Agitation,\u201d claiming the GOP\u2019s protests against segregation and the denial of voting rights to blacks sought to \u201crevive the dead and hateful race and sectional animosities in any part of our common country,\u201d which in turn \u201cmeans confusion, distraction of business, and the reopening of wounds now happily healed.\u201d There is no reference to four Democratic platforms, 1908-20, that are silent on blacks, segregation, lynching and voting rights as racial problems in the country mount. By contrast the GOP platforms of those years specifically address \u201cRights of the Negro\u201d (1908), oppose lynching (in 1912, 1920, 1924, 1928) and, as the New Deal kicks in, speak out about the dangers of making blacks \u201cwards of the state.\u201d\n\nAs for Women\u2019s Suffrage, President Woodrow Wilson, who himself was a virulent racist, was no early supporter. The prevalent historical revisionism that seeks to cast Wilson as the progenitor of modern Democratic progressivism routinely glosses over the fact that the nation\u2019s 28th President was a Southern-born man of his time, according syndicated columnist Jamie Stiehm:\n\nPresident Wilson didn\u2019t do a thing then, as popular sympathy and support for women\u2019s suffrage mounted. The signs women held up became more personal and pointed: the president who wished to make the world safe for democracy stood in the way of democracy at home. According to [Wilson biographer A. Scott Berg], Wilson supported the state-by-state approach, which would be in keeping with his cultural Southern character. But it\u2019s plain as day that Wilson relented and came very late to the suffrage game. The 19th Amendment finally passed in 1920 not because of him, but because of [Suffragette Alice] Paul. The world war mobilization gave Wilson a graceful \u2013 grudging? \u2013 reason why women should be rewarded with the vote.\n\nRe-litigating the history of each party\u2019s embrace of modern progressive priorities is a fool\u2019s game of dubious value. Republicans certainly do not enjoy a monopoly on virtue, and they don\u2019t make that claim. If, however, Cleaver insists that he opposes taking the country back to a dark time, it\u2019s relevant to state plainly who championed those oppressive policies he is denouncing.\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "Stale.", "title": "Dem Rep: You tea partiers want to bring back segregation and roll back women\u2019s rights", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2015/02/26/dem-rep-you-tea-partiers-want-to-bring-back-segregation-and-roll-back-womens-rights/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary", "creator": "@hotairblog"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "article": {"published_time": "2015-02-26T19:01:43+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-02-26T16:55:37+00:00"}, "keywords": "Emanuel Cleaver, jim crow, racism, Tea Party,", "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca4a4\"", "article_summary": "Many on the left insisted that what conservatives really meant was the return of Jim Crow and racial segregation.\nFrom 1868 to 1948, 20 Democratic Party governing platforms either supported racial segregation or failed to denounce it.\nWhere that pathological mistrust came from remains a mystery, but it was a charge that even Attorney General Eric Holder repeated.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going back to a day when we were segregated,\u201d Cleaver insisted, still castigating the imaginary tea partier in his mind.\nJim Crow laws that were passed in the solidly Democratic South following the collapse of Reconstruction were supported by Democratic lawmakers."}
