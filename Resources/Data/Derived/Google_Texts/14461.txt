Can be used for rehabilitative services, transportation, home care, housekeeping help, child care, to pay daily bills or replace lost wages while away from work. Long Term Care : covers the expense of daily living care that a medical plan typically doesn't cover, such as assistance with bathing, eating, dressing, and transportation. Covers care in the home, an assisted living facility and in a variety of other settings.

"Knowing the increasing costs of care, these product options really give Michigan residents peace of mind and help them prepare for life's unexpected moments," said Kevin Stutler, vice president, Ancillary Business for Blue Cross. "This collaboration gives us the opportunity to be a comprehensive resource for our members. We're giving Blue Cross members the opportunity to cover medical and other health needs at a reasonable cost with ease."

Unexpected health care costs are the primary cause of Americans filing for bankruptcy. Additionally, the Affordable Care Act may further spur demand for supplemental coverage.

Over the next nine to 12 months, the companies plan to continue their partnership to bring additional products to market. The products will be offered through BCBSM's health plan advisors, through agents appointed by both LifeSecure and BCBSM, with more information available online at bcbsm.com.
