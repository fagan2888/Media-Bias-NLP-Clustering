A more accurate analogy is an induced coma brought on by poor planning and implementation amidst an increased necessity to pare federal deficits.\n\nContrary to popular opinion, the setback for high speed rail is not entirely the skivvy of budget-cutting-obsessed Republicans. The Obama Administration\u2019s management of previously appropriated high speed rail funding has been as clumsy as its superintending of the Affordable Care Act\u2019s rollout.\n\nHow America has regressed from the brief halcyon dawn of high speed passenger rail to its seeming current twilight is mostly a tale of political wretchedness.\n\nIt wasn't so long ago \u2014 2009, actually \u2014 when Democrats controlled both chambers of Congress, that lawmakers approved, as part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA), $8 billion for high speed rail projects. The House passed the measure 246-183, with all \u201cyes\u201d votes coming from Democrats. In the Senate, the bill passed 60-38, with only three Republicans voting \u201cyes.\u201d\n\nGlory days for high speed passenger rail in America appeared to have arrived. Indeed, in 2011, President Obama voiced, in his State of the Union speech, a vision that 80% of Americans would have access to high speed passenger rail within 25 years. He proposed, on top of the $8 billion appropriated for high speed rail in 2009, another $53 billion over six years.\n\nBut budget-cutting Republicans had by then gained control of the House, and high speed rail fortunes began a deep dive south that hit bottom last week with passage by Congress of a $1.1 trillion omnibus spending bill (for the remainder of Fiscal Year 2014, which ends Oct. 1) that zeroed out any future spending on high speed rail. The reason extends beyond budget-cutting objectives.\n\nConsider, for example, that the omnibus spending bill provides an increase in spending on Amtrak ($1.39 billion, a $46 million boost over its previous appropriation), and a $600 million appropriation to extend Transportation Investment Generating Economic Recovery (TIGER) grants, some of which will be available for passenger rail projects.\n\nWhether more skillful handling by the Obama Administration of ARRA appropriations might have tempted Republican fellow-travelers to the future of high speed rail is indeterminate. That Republicans have adopted a more conciliatory approach to infrastructure funding, as evidenced by passage of the omnibus spending bill last week, is suggestive.\n\nFormer Urban Mass Transit Administration Associate Administrator Ken Orski, now a consultant and publisher of Innovation News Briefs, was instructive in his recent congressional testimony:\n\n\u201cThe Administration\u2019s first misstep, in my judgment, has been to misleadingly represent its program as \u2018high speed rail,\u2019 thus conjuring up an image of bullet trains cruising at 200 mph, just as they do in Western Europe and the Far East. It further raised false expectation by claiming that \u2018within 25 years, 80% of Americans will have access to high speed rail.\u2019 In reality, the Administration\u2019s high speed rail program will do no such thing ... with one exception, the program consists of a collection of planning, engineering, and construction grants that seek incremental improvements in the existing facilities of Class I freight railroads, in selected corridors used by Amtrak trains.\n\n\u201cWhile some of the projects funded with high speed rail dollars may result in modest increases of speed, frequency, and reliability of Amtrak services, none of the awards, except for the California grant, will lead to construction of new railbeds in dedicated rights-of-way. As any railroad operator will tell you, dedicated track, reserved exclusively for passenger trains, is essential to the operation of true high speed rail service \u2014 such as the service offered by the French TGV, the German ICE, and the Japanese Shinkansen trains, that run at top speeds of 200 mph and higher.\n\n\u201cFor example, while a $1.1 billion program of track upgrades between Chicago and St. Louis [over Union Pacific-owned track] will enable Amtrak trains to increase top speeds to 110 mph, average speeds between these two cities \u2014 slowed by the need of Amtrak trains to share track with freight traffic \u2014 will rise only 10 mph, from 53 to 63 mph.\u201d\n\nSlate magazine was equally disparaging:\n\n\u201cRather than focus on a few corridors that need high speed lines the most, the Obama Administration doled out half-a-billion here and half-a-billion there [145 projects in 32 states], a strategy better suited to currying political support than addressing real infrastructure projects.\u201d\n\nThe rejection of ARRA high speed rail grants by the states of Florida, Ohio and Wisconsin \u2014 albeit by Republican governors \u2014 was premised on a conclusion that the federal funds for high speed rail were distressingly insignificant to deliver what was promised. Cited was the inability of those states to find adequate additional funding to move beyond engineering and environmental reports and actually put people to work building high speed rail.\n\nMost interesting is that the Obama Administration\u2019s doling out of ARRA funds initially ignored the single shovel-ready high speed rail project \u2014 Amtrak's Northeast Corridor. Former House Transportation & Infrastructure Committee Chairman John Mica (R-Fla.), no fan of Amtrak or even high speed rail in his own state, was among the first to criticize this omission, submitting strongly that Republican support actually exists for a shovel-ready high speed rail project that could demonstrably be completed.\n\nMica wasn\u2019t playing politics, because there are scant Republican majorities along the Northeast Corridor; but California, for sure, is a political-party battleground, and that is where the Obama Administration directed the bulk of its ARRA funding. If high speed rail in America is now in an induced coma, the California project is on life support.\n\nSome history is in order. California voters in 2008 approved a $10 billion bond issue to help fund a $98 billion high speed rail project linking San Francisco and Los Angeles \u2014 and perhaps as far south as San Diego. The Obama Administration earmarked $3.2 billion in ARRA funds for that project (including portions of ARRA funds rejected by Florida, Ohio, and Wisconsin).\n\nRather than begin the project between two highly populated areas, which arguably would have bolstered public support, a decision was made \u2014 allegedly at the insistence of the Obama Administration and against recommendations of senior California legislative staff \u2014 to begin construction in the sparsely populated Central Valley between Merced and Bakersfield. Woe is the aftermath.\n\nRecently, a California court denied the California High Speed Rail Authority access to the bond funds because of failure by the state to comply with requirements. The Surface Transportation Board denied the Authority\u2019s request for an early conditional construction approval prior to completion of environmental review, and voter polls show waning public support (43% today vs. 53% in 2008) for the project, owing to cost estimates that escalated, a completion date that was extended, trip times that were revised to be longer, and reportedly higher than realistic ridership projections.\n\nAdd to this growing Congressional opposition. House Rail Subcommittee Chairman Jeff Denham (R-Calif.) and House Transportation Appropriations Subcommittee Chairman Tom Latham (R-Ia.) directed the General Accountability Office to review the ARRA grant in light of the court ruling and the Obama Administration\u2019s amendment of prior agreements that allow spending federal funds before state matching funds are released.\n\nDenham also introduced legislation to block spending of federal funds until the court releases the bond money. Co-sponsors include fellow House Republicans from California \u2013 Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy, Armed Services Committee Chairman Buck McKeon, and House Oversight Committee Chairman Darrell Issa.\n\nAn unpleasant sideshow surfaced when Federal Railroad Administrator Joseph Szabo sent his deputy, Karen Hedlund, to testify at a field hearing chaired by Denham. Denham told Politico he had rescheduled the hearing to accommodate Szabo\u2019s schedule.\n\nWhether the California project can be revived may well depend on a new ballot measure that could be put before California voters in November \u2014 and with voter polls showing increasing disenchantment, the future for that project is problematic beyond what transpires before the court and the completion of environmental studies.\n\nThat returns us to the shovel-ready Northeast Corridor and its aging infrastructure \u2014 tunnels dating to the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and catenary dating to the 1930s, for which reconstruction funds have not been appropriated.\n\nYet Amtrak's vision for 220-mph service between Washington, D.C., and Boston \u2014 cutting Washington-New York travel time to 96 minutes and New York-Boston trip time to 84 minutes \u2014 carries a whopping $117 billion price tag over 30 years.\n\nAs reported in a previous blog, the cost of Amtrak\u2019s vision equates to $1 billion per minute saved, and current Acela Express service, averaging 85 mph between Washington and New York with intermediate stops, hasn\u2019t discouraged a growing ridership, with Amtrak\u2019s air/rail market share between Washington and New York an impressive 70%.\n\nA Democratic controlled Congress \u2014 not envisioned by serious pundits come November elections \u2014 could restore a more broad vision for high speed rail in America. Perhaps the last best chance \u2014 directing ARRA funding to the Northeast Corridor \u2014 was rejected by the Obama Administration. What is necessary to revive such support in a Congress, given expected continued Republican control of the House and continued pressure to reduce federal spending, cannot be predicted.\n\nWhat can be said with certainty is that the current Amtrak annual appropriation is insufficient even to bring the Northeast Corridor into a state of good repair \u2014 the last major track rehabilitation was undertaken in the 1980s \u2014 and there is compelling reason to build new tunnels and catenary for existing service and bring Amtrak closer to airports before embarking on a high speed rail project.\n\nIt may be true that in politics, moods and priorities change. But whether the will and wherewithal to fund high speed rail for 80% of the population, or even in the populous California and Northeast corridors, is realistic this year, next year, or the years ahead, is a difficult call.\n\nThe Obama Administration, notwithstanding its intentions, has not helped the cause. The induced coma of high speed rail today is as much the fault of a flawed rollout as it is of budget-cutting conservatives, whose numbers in Congress continue to grow.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Blame aplenty for high-speed rail woes", "author": "Frank N.
