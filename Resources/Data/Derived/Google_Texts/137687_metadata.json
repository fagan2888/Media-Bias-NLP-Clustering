Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, wrote to Carter on Feb. 1. \u201cAs the secretary of Defense, you are inevitably a prime target for foreign hackers. As such, the threat is real and compliance with the law is essential.\u201d\n\nThough Carter acknowledged and apologized for his lapse, Grassley is seeking an accounting of how the Pentagon handled the online security procedures when he assumed the department\u2019s top job, how it is handling the aftermath and whether Carter\u2019s claim that no classified information was involved holds up.\n\n\u201cPersonal email use is against various government laws and rules, including those maintained by the National Archives and Records Administration and the Defense Department, and might impede compliance with the Freedom of Information Act,\u201d Grassley\u2019s letter noted, citing the Archives\u2019 2013 bulletin providing guidance for officials on retaining federal records.
