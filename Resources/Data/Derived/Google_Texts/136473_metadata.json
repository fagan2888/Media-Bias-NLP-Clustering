But men still earn more, a new study finds.\n\nThe report in this week\u2019s Journal of the American Medical Association found that even after controlling for age, race, marital status and children in the home, males in nursing out-earned females by nearly $7,700 per year in outpatient settings and nearly $3,900 in hospitals.\n\nEven as men flowed into nursing over the past decades, the pay gap did not narrow over the years studied: 1988 to 2013.\n\nAccording to the Census Bureau, men made up about 9 percent of registered nurses in 2011, roughly a three-fold increase from 1970. And even though men were not permitted in nursing programs at some schools until the 1980s, they have overall earned more, just as in society at large.\n\nThe biggest disparity was for nurse anesthetists, with men earning $17, 290 more.\n\n[Also: 2015 brings big paydays for CFOs]\n\nUlrike Muench of the University of California-San Francisco, the study\u2019s lead author, said in an interview that the data do not suggest why men earn more, although \u201csome have suggested men have better negotiating skills\u201d and are able to start out earning higher salaries.\n\nJennifer Stewart, who oversees nursing and other workforce issues at the health research group The Advisory Board, agrees that\u2019s one possibility. \u201cAlso maybe some gender discrimination,\u201d she adds.\n\nBut most people who study nursing trends say this is a difficult problem to sort out.\n\nFor example, says Stewart, because men have joined the profession more recently, women tend to be more senior nurses. But as such, they get to work preferred day shifts, even though night and weekend shifts tend to pay more.\n\n[Also: See where personal care aid wages have fallen]\n\nPeter McMenamin, a health economist at the American Nurses Association, says that while ANA policy \u201cis that there should be pay equity,\u201d he\u2019s not convinced the problem is as large as the study suggests. For one thing, he says, with so many women compared to men in the study, the numbers for women \u201care much more precise.\u201d\n\nBut no one questions the overall finding that men out-earn women. And that is \u201cdismaying,\u201d says McMenamin. \u201cWe would like any differentials in pay to be based on skills and experience and not on gender,\u201d he said.\n\nThe study analyzed data from the National Sample Survey of Registered Nurses (which ended in 2008) as well as from the Census Bureau\u2019s American Community Survey for years 2001-2013.\n\nKaiser Health News is a national health policy news service.
