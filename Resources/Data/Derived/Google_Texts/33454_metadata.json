The D.C. Health Benefit Exchange Authority uses tens of millions of dollars from the city\u2019s general fund to run its exchange under the Affordable Care Act, so it should not be bending the rules, the lawsuit says.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d like to see our laws abided by, or changed,\u201d Mr. Vining, a retired federal worker, told reporters at the National Press Club.\n\nIn the lawsuit, Judicial Watch notes that members of Congress and staff members account for the bulk of enrollment on the small-business exchange. They say 12,359 of the 14,289 people who enrolled in the small-business exchange through Sept. 9 came from Congress, underscoring their reliance on the District.\n\nSEE ALSO: Pro-life groups protest government funded abortions\n\nThe D.C. exchange did not immediately comment on the lawsuit Wednesday.\n\nUnder the health care law, the federal government may only offer health coverage to members of Congress and certain staff members through an Obamacare exchange.\n\nSen. Chuck Grassley, Iowa Republican, crafted the language to see if Democratic architects of the law would be willing to experience what millions of average Americans would, since the law requires most people to hold insurance and the exchange was the most affordable route to acquiring it. Democrats took him up on the challenge and agreed to the provision.\n\nBut the Office of Personnel Management said last year that denizens of Capitol Hill could keep an employer subsidy that covers up to 75 percent of their premiums if they sign up through the D.C. small-business exchange.\n\nThe move caused some Republican lawmakers and observers to accuse Congress of \u201cexempting\u201d itself from its own law. The Judicial Watch lawsuit adds a new wrinkle, in that it goes after the D.C. exchange instead of individual members or the Obama administration.\n\n\u201cThe District of Columbia should not be a party to this fraud,\u201d Mr. Fitton said.\n\nAlso this week, lawyers on behalf of Republican Sens. Ted Cruz and John Cornyn of Texas have filed a brief in support of a lawsuit that argues Obamacare violates the U.S. Constitution\u2019s requirement that all tax bills originate in the U.S. House of Representatives.\n\n\u201cWhile it may seem odd that sitting Senators would speak out in support of enforcing restrictions on the authority of their own chamber to initiate bills for raising revenues, their duty is first and foremost to \u2018support and defend the Constitution,\u2019 not to aggrandize power for themselves and their Senate colleagues,\u201d lawyers said in the paperwork filed Tuesday.\n\nA three-judge panel of the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia had ruled over the summer that the Obamacare tax was \u201cincidental\u201d to the primary purpose of the Affordable Care Act, so it isn\u2019t a revenue-raising measure as envisioned by the Constitution.\n\nThe origination issue had been in doubt after the Supreme Court\u2019s decision two years ago saying that while the law\u2019s individual mandate wasn\u2019t allowed under Congress\u2019s powers to control interstate commerce, it was a valid exercise of Congress\u2019s taxing power.\n\nSince the key language of Obamacare came from the Senate, some opponents then said it violated the \u201corigination\u201d requirement in the constitution that revenue-raising measures begin in the House.\n\nThe two senators requested a rehearing by the full appellate court.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A conservative public-interest law firm sued the D.C. health exchange Wednesday for letting members of Congress get health insurance through their small-business portal even though each chamber on Capitol Hill employs thousands of people.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "A conservative public-interest law firm sued the D.C. health exchange Wednesday for letting members of Congress get health insurance through their small-business portal even though each chamber on Capitol Hill employs thousands of people.", "title": "Public interest group sues D.C.
