Now, Myeisha McDaniels\u2019 family has an emotional plea to her killer.\n\nThrough tears, McDaniels\u2019 mother, Shirleen Jefferson says, \u201cI\u2019m begging y'all to come forward, please lord Jesus this has got to stop, please Jesus y'all have got to stop.\u201d\n\nInstead of celebrating the New Year and new beginnings, the parents and sister of Myeisha McDaniels are making funeral arraignments for the 22-year-old.\n\n\u201cThis is a good person who dedicated her life to school, to saving lives, not for someone to take her life,\u201d McDaniels\u2019 sister, Tyeshia, said.\n\nThe recent Dillard graduate had a bright future. Plaques and trophies inside her room showcase the accomplishments of the straight-A student, who earned a degree in biology, with aspirations of becoming a brain surgeon.\n\n\u201cI come from a good foundation, we used to be the four musketeers. Now we're the three musketeers and I don\u2019t have my sister so whoever did this, look what you done tore up,\u201d Tyeisha said.\n\n\u201cAll I know, she left with her friend, she didn\u2019t come back home. Her friend called about an hour later, telling me she got shot,\u201d McDaniels\u2019 father, Harry Jefferson, explained.\n\nSomeone drove McDaniels to Tulane Medical Center around 9 p.m., in her White Nissan Altima, with the front windshield partially shattered.\n\n\u201cThey ain\u2019t telling me who it was,\u201d Shirleen said.\n\nNew Orleans police say McDaniels had a gunshot wound and later died at the hospital. Investigators believe the shooting happened in the 3700 block of Clio Street, but have released few other details.\n\n\u201cAnybody know, please tell me, please come tell me, please tell me what happened to my child,\u201d Shirleen pleaded.\n\nTyeshia, adds, \u201cPlease come forward, please say what you did done, you took our soul, took our soul, you took our soul.\u201d\n\nMcDaniels\u2019 family says she just secured a job in the medical field, which she was to start this Tuesday, and was looking into medical schools. If you know anything about her murder, call Crimestoppers at 504-822-1111.\n\nCopyright 2016 WVUE.
