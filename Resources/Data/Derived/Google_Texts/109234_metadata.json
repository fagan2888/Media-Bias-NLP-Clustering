After losing his first match, Sharp won two straight for a third place finish. (Brandon Boles / Fort Morgan Times)\n\nFort Morgan High School was the host site for the Colorado 7 League Championships on Saturday, the final wrestling event of the regular season. After hosting the Morgan County Duals on Wednesday, the Mustangs were looking forward to hosting their fellow conference foes to see who the best of the best was this season.\n\nAnd the Mustangs did not disappoint, as all nine varsity wrestlers and both JV wrestlers placed with some strong performances on the mat.\n\nTwo young Mustangs took fourth place on the day, with Hunter Machuca wrestling hard in a pair of matches and taking fourth at 132 for the Mustangs. Dylan McBride picked up a big 8-2 win against Fort Lupton in the consolation semi-finals to have a chance at third place at 145, and while he would fall to finish fourth, he wrestled to a 5-0 decision and showed promise for the upcoming week and the rest of his varsity career.\n\nFort Morgan junior Jacob Fritzler locks in a pin against Elizabeth in his first match at the Colorado 7 League Championships. He would go on to take first place in the 170 pound division on the day. (Brandon Boles / Fort Morgan Times)\n\nTwo more Mustangs wrestled for third place and were victorious in their final matches to obtain that spot on the day. Sterling Sharp was one of them at 138. He lost by pin in his first match, but saw his winning form when he pinned his Fort Lupton opponent in his second match. In the third place match, Sharp scored a lot, leading to a 16-7 majority decision.\n\nChris Shriver was the other wrestler to finish third, doing so at 160. He started strong with a pin against Fort Lupton, but lost a tough match to Elizabeth by decision in his second match, 3-1. In the consolation semi-finals, he secured a pin in the third period against Vista PEAK, and in the third place match he only needed 47 seconds to finish with another win by pin and the third spot in the weight class.\n\nAt 152, Francisco Rosales earned a spot in the championship match against Fort Lupton after first defeating his opponent from Alameda in the semi-finals with a pin at 2:58 in the match. For the championship, he was caught in a weird position against Fort Lupton that would lead to a pin, but a strong effort gave Rosales a second place finish in the weight class.\n\nFor four Mustangs, they finished the day becoming the conference champions, as Fort Morgan won four of the five the weight classes from 170 up to heavyweight. Jacob Fritzler was the first champion crowned for the team at 170, when he knocked off a pair of opponents from Vista PEAK and Elizabeth by first round pin to go up against Weld Central in the final. With first place on the line, Fritzler scored a takedown and worked on the ground to score consistently through two periods for a 14-0 lead, and finished it off with two more points in the final period for a technical fall victory, 16-0.\n\nAlex Mai was strong at 195 all season long, and proved so again on Saturday. He only needed 49 seconds in his first match against Alameda before submitting his opponent with a pin. In the championship match, Mai scored frequently with takedowns and back points, resulting in a 19-4 technical fall win for first place.\n\nIt was a clean sweep for Toby McBride at 220, doing so with a pair of first round pins. He finished his first opponent Alameda in 1:14, and in an intriguing championship match against Fort Lupton, he threw his opponent down and secured a pin at 1:37 for first place.\n\nAt heavyweight, Jesus Ibarra had short work in the second round to finish his two matches towards first place. 16 seconds into the second period of his first match, he locked in the pin to wrestle for first place. Against Fort Lupton in the championship match, his opponent tried to throw him down with a headlock, but Ibarra escaped and used it to his advantage, getting on top and finishing with a pin at 2:46.\n\nIn addition to the nine varsity wrestlers, two Mustangs competed in the JV tournament weight classes on the day. Brayden Schulte wrestled at 195, finishing third after his two matches. Kayden Lorenzini secured a pair of pins to win the 145 pound JV class on the day.\n\nWith the strong performance by the whole team, Fort Morgan finished second in the team scores at the tournament with 142 points. After the tournament, junior Toby McBride was also voted the Colorado 7 League Wrestler of the Year following a season where he went 27-1 at 220 pounds this year.\n\nNow, the Mustangs gear up for their most critical week of the season, as the team will travel to Windsor for Regionals this weekend looking for a shot to qualify for the State tournament in Denver in two weeks.
