They awaited entrance to the building for a Trump rally at noon.\n\nKreutzer and his group agreed the republican frontrunner would be a skilled financial adviser in office.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re business majors,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s kind of why we\u2019re here. We like good business.\u201d\n\nKreutzer said he isn\u2019t definitively voting for Trump.\n\n\u201cThere are some (of his) policies I like and some I don\u2019t like,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re kind of people-watching here.\u201d\n\nIncoming freshman Morgan Vize also stood in line, not donning any Trump attire like the people around her.\n\nShe listened to a security officer tell the crowd that any protester trying to sneak in would be arrested.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t consider myself a protestor, but I\u2019m not for Trump at all,\u201d Vize said. \u201cPeople are going in anyway.\u201d\n\nShe said she seems to like Bernie Sanders, but has not made up her mind yet.\n\nTrump spoke for more than an hour after being nearly 20 minutes late to take the stage.\n\nThe rally consisted of him as well as an endorsement from former Indiana University basketball coach Bob Knight.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not about republican or democrat,\u201d Knight said. \u201cIt\u2019s about picking the best man for the job.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s speech primarily focused on his success in other states. He brushed several issues such as Obamacare, the 2nd Amendment and ISIS, but did not elaborate on potential policies.\n\nJunior Holli Melton said as a future teacher, she supports Trump on the basis of education.\n\n\u201cI totally agree with him about ending the common core,\u201d the biology teaching major said. \u201cI\u2019m from Kentucky, but I\u2019ve chosen to not teach in Kentucky because they have adopted the core.\u201d\n\nShe said the event was her first political rally, and this presidential election is the first she\u2019s eligible to vote in.\n\n\u201cThe rally was very interesting,\u201d Melton said. \u201cPeople were insane, but in a good way. There was a lot of positive energy. When people say Donald Trump, there\u2019s sometimes a negative stigma, but there were a lot of positive vibes today.\u201d\n\nDuring and following the rally, Trump supporters and protesters hurled insults at each other from across a street adjacent to the building.\n\nWomen screamed \u201cF*ck Trump\u201d across the road as they pushed strollers with peacefully sleeping babies down the sidewalk.\n\nBoth sides used gay slurs and expletives to accuse the other of being uneducated.\n\nFreshman Paiden Myers observed from the side and didn\u2019t consider the exchanges violent.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been pretty peaceful with only one person arrested,\u201d the nursing major said. \u201cThere are some chants, but that\u2019s it.\u201d\n\nThe police arrested Kelley Lynn Barnes, 36, for public nudity, according to the Vanderburgh County Sheriff\u2019s Department.\n\nShe pulled down her pants in response to the Trump supporters. Her bond was set at $50.\n\nMyers said he enjoyed seeing a potential president in person, and although he mostly supports Trump, he would want to see Bernie Sanders, too.\n\n\u201cTrump did a good job, but he mostly spouted out stuff I already knew before,\u201d he said. \u201cThere was nothing new.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"language": "en, sv", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Shield", "description": "Matt Kreutzer said when it comes to Donald Trump, there could be a better choice but there could be a worse choice.
