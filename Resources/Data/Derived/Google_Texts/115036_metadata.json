In the past few weeks the Observer has learned of companies withdrawing overtime and Sunday pay, bonuses, free food and paid breaks in order to keep the wage bill down.\n\nSiobhain McDonagh MP, who called the backbenchers\u2019 debate, said: \u201cWhen the chancellor announced the national living wage, he said, \u2018Britain deserves a pay rise and it\u2019s getting one.\u2019 I took him at his word on that. People should get a pay rise, not a pay cut.\u201d\n\nShe began campaigning after a constituent who works for B&Q reported that a rise in basic pay was being accompanied by cuts to Sunday and bank holiday pay as well as bonuses. It emerged that her constituent would be more than \u00a32,000 a year worse off. She has since met other B&Q workers who are set to lose out, including one whose take-home wages will drop by 30% with the loss of Sunday pay. They had worked at the retailer for almost 20 years.\n\nMcDonagh argues that the government should look at preventing businesses offsetting the cost of the national living wage by cutting perks. That could include insisting that staff are paid for the legally required 20-minute break in a six-hour shift.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Guardian has admitted the so-called \"living wage\" is causing employers to cut perks, hours and even pay to some employees", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "The Guardian has admitted the so-called \"living wage\" is causing employers to cut perks, hours and even pay to some employees", "title": "Guardian: Living Wage Causing Employers To Cut Perks, Hours And Pay", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2016/04/guardian.png", "height": 480}, "updated_time": "2016-04-16T10:08:56-07:00", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/london/2016/04/16/employers-claw-back-living-wage-cuts-perks-hours-pay/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The Guardian has admitted the so-called \"living wage\" is causing employers to cut perks, hours and even pay to some employees", "title": "Guardian: Living Wage Causing Employers To Cut Perks, Hours And Pay", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2016/04/guardian.png", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true", "app_id": 1243316582352556}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "living wage, minimum wage, The Guardian,Breitbart London, Breitbart TV,living wage", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "published_time": "2016-04-16T08:29:39-07:00", "section": "Breitbart London", "modified_time": "2016-04-16T10:08:56-07:00", "tag": "The Guardian", "categories": "Breitbart London,Breitbart TV"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "McDonagh argues that the government should look at preventing businesses offsetting the cost of the national living wage by cutting perks.\nThe Guardian has admitted the so-called \u201cliving wage\u201d is causing employers to cut perks, hours and even pay to some employees:From fish factories in Grimsby to coffee shops in central London and even Waitrose supermarkets, workers across the country are seeing perks and pay rates cut as companies try to offset the cost of George Osborne\u2019s national living wage.\nPeople should get a pay rise, not a pay cut.\u201dShe began campaigning after a constituent who works for B&Q reported that a rise in basic pay was being accompanied by cuts to Sunday and bank holiday pay as well as bonuses.\nSiobhain McDonagh MP, who called the backbenchers\u2019 debate, said: \u201cWhen the chancellor announced the national living wage, he said, \u2018Britain deserves a pay rise and it\u2019s getting one.\u2019 I took him at his word on that.\nIn the past few weeks the Observer has learned of companies withdrawing overtime and Sunday pay, bonuses, free food and paid breaks in order to keep the wage bill down."}
