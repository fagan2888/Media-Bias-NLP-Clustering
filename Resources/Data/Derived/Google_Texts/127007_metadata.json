Designed, apparently, to undermine White House talks to de-nuclearize Iran, Boehner\u2019s back got blown by influential, parties who aren\u2019t necessarily Friends of Obama or Fans of Iran \u2013 including muscular Israeli spy agency Mossad, the Anti-Defamation League, the pencil-necks at the New York Times editorial page and Fox News anchor Shepard Smith. Now, Senate Democrats have joined the party, if tardily, by announcing they won\u2019t vote on a Republican-led Iran sanctions bill \u2013 for now. Heeding the critics, they\u2019ve decided to give the fragile negotiations more time.\n\nNo Strategy? Big Problem: While we\u2019re on the subject of international affairs, three former American military commanders confirmed what many have suspected: President Barack Obama and his national security team don\u2019t have a plan for winning the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and the president seems paralyzed by the crisis of Islamic State group and the Rubik\u2019s Cube of a war going on in Syria. U.S. News\u2019 Paul D. Shinkman reports that the commanders \u2013 retired Marine Gen. Jim Mattis, retired Navy Adm. William Fallon (who is also a former CentCom chief) and former Army Vice Chief of Staff Gen. John Keane \u2013 told the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee that the White House has to \u201ccome out from our reactive crouch and take a firm, strategic stance in defense of our values.\u201d No word on exactly what those are, or against whom we should defend them.\n\nDrawn Conclusion:", "article_metadata": {"zone": "homepage/articles", "keyword": "Washington Whispers [News]", "title": "Last Call: Searching for a Plan Edition", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "Dems join in to give negotiations with Iran a chance and the Koch Brothers consider their candidates.", "title": "Last Call: Searching for a Plan Edition", "url": "http://www.usnews.com/news/blogs/washington-whispers/2015/01/27/last-call-searching-for-a-plan-edition", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/ee/f8/023b3fc44433b388c7cfe16cb305/150127-boehner-editorial.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Dems join in to give negotiations with Iran a chance and the Koch Brothers consider their candidates.", "site": "@USNews", "card": "summary", "title": "Last Call: Searching for a Plan Edition"}, "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "site": "news", "date_published": "Jan. 27, 2015", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "page_type": "article", "keywords": "Joseph P.
