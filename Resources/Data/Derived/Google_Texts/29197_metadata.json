With the imminent decline and fall of Jeb Bush, the Republican establishment\u2019s previous candidate of choice, signs of Rubio\u2019s coming coronation are clear. There are reports of a \u201cRubio surge\u201d in the press and in polls, new commitments from influential GOP donors like billionaire investor Paul Singer, and a growing list of key GOP establishment endorsements. Tuesday\u2019s debate only bolstered the perception that Rubio, not Bush, represents the GOP\u2019s elite kingmakers.\n\nUnfortunately for Rubio and his growing base of influential backers, closer scrutiny of the Washington tea leaves portends fatal political consequences: Rubio cannot and will not win the presidency. There are many reasons Rubio is unelectable, but they can be boiled down to the following 10.\n\n1. Rubio\u2019s list of accomplishments doesn\u2019t include anything that can be seen, heard or touched in the actual world. Unless there\u2019s a broad conspiracy in the media to hide Rubio\u2019s many and monumental accomplishments, the campaign dynamics will soon reveal that there\u2019s not much there, even on Rubio\u2019s own campaign website: \u201cAs a U.S. Senator, Marco has led a bold offensive to institute innovative, conservative ideas to address these fundamental issues and to restore hope in the American Dream.\u201d Not the kinds of concrete verbs and measureable achievements one would advise a recent college grad to put on his resume, much less a candidate for president. Noting Rubio\u2019s anemic record, Ted Cruz backers recently released a funny ad that asks, \u201cCan anyone think of ANYTHING Marco Rubio\u2019s ever done? Anything at all?\u201d\n\n2. Between a Tea Party rock and a Latino hard place is no place for a serious candidate to be.Like the GOP, Marco Rubio finds himself trapped between two diametrically opposed forces that will loom even larger this election season: anti-immigrant, anti-Latino Tea Party activists and Latino voters. This quagmire already got Rubio into problems during his bid to gain the VP spot in 2012. Activists on both sides hammered him for adopting positions they felt were too close to the other, a situation that shows signs of getting even worse.\n\n3. Rubio\u2019s immigrant story will sink in a sea of national scrutiny. The self-described \u201cson of exiles,\u201d Rubio has centered his campaign narrative around the story of his immigrant parents, whom he said, \u201ccame to America following Fidel Castro\u2019s takeover.\u201d Unless history books are altered to reflect that Castro\u2019s revolution actually took place before his parents arrived in the U.S. on May 27, 1956\u2014a full two and a half years before the Cuban revolution took place\u2014the boat of Rubio\u2019s phony immigration story will sink under the national scrutiny the general election will surely bring.\n\n4. Tea Party Troubles will leave the GOP\u2019s\u2014and Rubio\u2019s\u2014tent in tatters. The fight brewing between Rubio and Tea Party favorite Ted Cruz reflects the core division that splits the party and that will burn the tent down by the end of the 2016 election. While Cruz continues to walk the talk of a die-hard Tea Partier, Rubio launched his successful bid to become Florida\u2019s junior senator of the Tea Party only to adopt the more \u201cmoderate\u201d tones and policy positions of his former mentor-turned-frenemy, Jeb Bush. This alienated the Tea Party base to the point where they are publicly attacking Rubio as a \u201csellout\u201d on immigration and other issues, funding billboards denouncing \u201cThe Rubio-Obama Immigration Plan. Amnesty.\u201d Though Rubio has since renounced previous positions on comprehensive immigration reform and other issues, many in the Tea Party base are supporting Cruz, who wasted no time highlighting these differences during Tuesday\u2019s debate.", "article_metadata": {"description": "After Jeb's collapse, Republican elites are ready to crown the Florida senator.
