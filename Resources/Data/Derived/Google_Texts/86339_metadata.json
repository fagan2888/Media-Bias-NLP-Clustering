Zuma Press\n\nBeijing may be better known for its pollution than its bucolic charms. But that isn\u2019t stopping the government from trying to develop a rural region northwest of the city into a Napa Valley-style attraction.\n\nLast month, the government hosted the 11th International Conference on Grapevine Breeding and Genetics in Beijing\u2019s Yanqing county, a five-day affair involving wine tasting competitions and networking among grape breeders and geneticists from around the world.\n\nIn addition to hosting such a conference, the government also recently finished the construction of a so-called \u201cInternational Grape Exhibition Garden,\u201d which will consist of vineyards that they hope will attract an increasingly wine-loving public.\n\n\u201cWe want to build our own Bordeaux in China,\u201d said Pang Rongnian, the International Grape Exhibition Garden\u2019s deputy director. He declined to comment on how much the government has invested in the garden\u2019s creation.\n\nThe garden is home to 750,000 square meters of vineyards, along with a 2,500 square-meter greenhouse that will help nurture more than 1,000 kinds of grapes from more than 40 countries.\n\nAccording to Vinexpo, which hosts regular wine and spirits exhibitions, China consumes more wine than any other country in the world. Last year, China consumed more than 1.9 billion bottles of red wine in 2013, up 136% compared to 2008.\n\nAlso last year, auction house Christie\u2019s set up the world\u2019s first estate agency for wealthy Chinese to buy vineyards.\n\nIn addition to the vineyards, the Yanqing garden will also include a museum about grapes, as well as sculptures of grapes made by Italian architecture firm Italian Archea Studio. Entrance fees will be priced at $10 per adult, with organizers hoping that engaged couples might also choose to hold their weddings on the premises, or at least take their wedding photos there. So far, response to the park has been strong, organizers say, with some 2,000 visitors arriving on the second day of its opening.\n\nPart of the attraction, visitors told China Real Time over the opening weekend, was the large plots of what they described as lavender growing in the garden. However, a garden guide explained that plots weren\u2019t actually lavender, after all.\n\n\u201cWe know that Chinese are fond of taking wedding dress photos in gardens of lavender. The purple color is very attractive,\u201d the guide said. \u201cSo we chose the same color, but used cheaper plants\u2014salvia and verbena. They look like lavender but actually they are not.\u201d\n\nIf lavender isn\u2019t the draw, will the quality of Beijing-area wines ever become a magnet? Organizers point to the fact that Beijing\u2019s Yanqing county is actually located on the same latitude as Bordeaux, the famed French wine-producing region.\n\nHowever, Duan Changqing, professor with China Agricultural University, said that when it comes to grape production, \u201cit\u2019s meaningless to talk about latitude.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a combination of other elements,\u201d Mr. Duan said. \u201cBasically, there are four elements of grape cultivation\u2014temperature, illumination, water and soil.\u201d\n\nThat being said, Mr. Duan added that apart from its exceptionally dry winters, the region would seem well-suited for such a purpose. Air pollution, he said, could actually be helpful for grape cultivation. \u201cThe dirt could help to reduce some illumination intensity,\u201d he said, which would assist with the development of grapes. \u201cBeijing has too much sunshine.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Olivia Geng\n\n_____________________________________\n\nAlso popular on China Real Time now:\n\nChinese Lawyer Gao Zhisheng Released From Prison; Now What?\n\nMeet China\u2019s Boomerang Kids: One-Third of Graduates Still Rely on Parents, Survey Says", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "Beijing may be better known for its pollution than its bucolic charms.
