As “Mad Men” draws to an end, filming the second half of its seventh and final season, stars John Slattery and Christina Hendricks are moving on. Slattery, who directed five episodes of AMC’s hit series, is making his feature-length film directorial debut with “God’s Pocket,” boasting an impressive cast with Hendricks, Philip Seymour Hoffman, John Turturro and Richard Jenkins.

The script, which he co-wrote with screenwriter Alex Metcalf, is based on National Book Award-winning writer Peter Dexter’s novel of the same name about a man from a working-class neighborhood who tries to cover-up the death of his unlikeable stepson. “I tried to get the rights, I couldn’t get them. I gave up,” Slattery said of the novel at the movie’s premiere at the Sundance Film Festival. But he tried again, this time just using “the book sort of as the Bible,” eventually turned the draft into a screenplay.

The story was powerful enough to attract an all-star cast, despite a tight budget. “They came to work ready and they know it’s not a big film,” said the four-time Best Supporting Actor Emmy nominee. “It’s not a studio film where you can kind of learn your lines while you’re shooting it. Everyone came ready and ready to change things up and work off of each other.”
