The intersection of East Hampden Avenue and South Buckley Road has re-opened Sunday evening following a three-vehicle crash that sent a dozen people to the hospital, two of them with life-threatening injuries.

The crash happened shortly after 2 p.m., according to Sgt. Chris Carleton, a police spokesman.

Police said that a silver Saturn sport-utility vehicle with four people inside made a left turn from westbound Hampden onto southbound Buckley.

As it was turning, the Saturn was struck broadside by a black Honda traveling east. A backseat passenger from the Saturn, a female in her 20â€™s, was ejected and critically injured. The Saturn then struck a white Toyota that was stopped on northbound Buckley.

The female that was ejected from the Saturn and the rest of the occupants were transported to local hospitals. The Honda was occupied by a five people, an adult and four children. One of the children in the Honda was critically injured. None in the Honda appeared to be wearing seat belts or were properly restrained.

Several people in the Toyota were taken to a hospital as a precaution.

Carleton said neither alcohol nor speed are considered to be factors in this crash.
