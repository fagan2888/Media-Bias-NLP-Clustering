But the problems with the law go further than the website. These problems are not incidental, but central to its design and the intentions of its architects.\n\nMany Obamacare backers, including Barack Obama, would prefer \u201csingle payer\u201d health insurance. The government would pay for everything and you would get health care for free.\n\nThere is an inconsistency here with the way we treat other things regarded as the basics of life \u2014 food, shelter, clothing. Government subsidizes food purchases only for some \u2014 though a sharply increasing number in the Obama years \u2014 through food stamps.\n\nIt also has subsidized housing through loan guarantees and laws encouraging mortgages for the uncreditworthy \u2014 policies that resulted in the financial crisis of 2008\u201309.\n\nGovernment hasn\u2019t yet proposed subsidizing the purchase of clothing. But the thought is that health care, which imposes disproportionate costs on some individuals, should be provided for free.\n\nObamacare\u2019s architects knew the votes weren\u2019t there for single-payer insurance, so they fashioned their health-care legislation and regulations to reduce out-of-pocket costs for people with different health-care needs.\n\nInsurance policies have to include coverage for services that many consumers will not need, including maternity coverage and mental-health treatments.\n\nEven Obamacare enthusiasts, such as Harold Pollack of the University of Chicago, suggest that the administration should \u201crevisit just how minimal the most minimal insurance policies should be.\u201d\n\nBut that would work against the Obamacare goal of moving everyone toward paying less out of pocket for health care.\n\nEven more egregious is Obamacare\u2019s requirement that policies for one age group cost no more than three times the cost for another. In practice, this means that young consumers, who incur few heath-care costs, are asked to subsidize people in old age groups, who incur many more.\n\nThis is the opposite of the progressive economic redistribution that American liberals usually favor.\n\nPeople in their 20s tend to have negative net worths. They owe more \u2014 in consumer debt, on college loans \u2014 than they have in bank accounts, home equity, and financial assets.\n\nIn contrast, people in the 55\u201364 age group, the oldest covered by Obamacare, tend to have relatively high net worths. Federal Reserve wealth statistics consistently show that Americans reach their peak net worth in these years. After age 65, they start spending that net worth down.\n\nSo why did the Obamacare architects want to take from the poor and give to the relatively rich? Because they want to make health insurance less like insurance \u2014 which protects you against unlikely and unwelcome events \u2014 and more like an entitlement.\n\nEqualizing premiums tends to move in that direction. The fact that Obamacare policies are like auto-insurance policies that cover oil changes is, for the Obamacare architects, a feature \u2014 not a bug.\n\nOf course, reducing health-care outlays once the insurance premium is paid makes health-care consumers less price-conscious. It means that market mechanisms that have reduced the cost of noninsurable treatments \u2014 cosmetic surgery, Lasik treatments \u2014 will not be operating.\n\nAnd it increases the likelihood that health-care providers will act like the callous unionized employees in Britain\u2019s National Health Service who let patients in the Mid Staffordshire hospitals die unattended or lie in their own waste.\n\nThe problem for Obamacare architects is that people are resisting being conscripted into their service. The low penalties for remaining uninsured in early years, plus the difficulty of using HealthCare.gov, mean that many young people are not signing up.\n\nThis means that insurers will likely be stuck with a group of subscribers who are relatively sick, and they will have to raise premiums sharply next year to avoid losses \u2014 the death spiral you have been reading about.\n\nIt also means that others, particularly those not eligible for subsidies, may go shopping outside the website for policies that cover catastrophic costs and leave them free to decide whether and how much to spend on routine care.\n\nThe Obama administration\u2019s response has been lawlessness \u2014 suspending the law on employer mandates, subsidy verification, subsidies for federal health-exchange policies, and availability of preexisting policies.\n\nThe insightful liberal journalist Thomas Edsall asks on his New York Times blog, \u201cIs the federal government capable of managing the provision of a fundamental service through an extraordinarily complex system?\u201d\n\nThe answer, on health care as on food, shelter, and clothing, seems to be \u201cno.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Michael Barone is senior political analyst for the Washington Examiner. \u00a9 2013 The Washington Examiner.
