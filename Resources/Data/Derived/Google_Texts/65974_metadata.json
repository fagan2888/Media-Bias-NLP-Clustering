He chalked it up to something simple: \u201c[The] most important thing,\u201d he said, \u201cis to set really aggressive goals.\u201d\n\nAccording to the technology denizen, when the company set early revenue growth goals, its investors asked them why they were not aiming higher. In retrospect, given the company\u2019s growth, the anecdote is contentedly ironic.\n\nGrowth, of course, is not always the easiest thing to manage for most companies. It becomes increasingly difficult when you expand as quickly as Zenefits. Conrad addressed the issue, saying that \u201cthe only thing worse than growing quickly,\u201d he said, \u201cis not growing quickly.\u201d\n\nZenefits also announced that its product is now Affordable Care Act (ACA)-compliant. Given that the ACA, better known by the theoretical pejorative \u2018Obamacare,\u2019 requires a fair amount of compliance work, the feature matters. According to Conrad, \u201cif you are a 75-person company, you don\u2019t have someone whose job it is to spend 15 hours a month tracking this compliance [stuff].\u201d\n\nIn a way, the ACA compliance news from Zenefits fits into its larger corporate push \u2014 make the work it takes to manage and care for your workers as simple as possible.\n\nLynley pressed the founder on how long-term its customers are, or will be. Will a firm that starts small and grows, age out of the Zenefits ecosystem? Conrad noted that most of its customers are between 50 and 1,000 employees, but that there is now a \u201cfundamental break point\u201d in its product at scale.\n\nThe interview touched on the topic of payroll, which Conrad called a \u201cvery important spoke.\u201d ZenPayroll, a different company, recently rebranded as \u2018Gusto\u2019 and entered into Zenefits\u2019 market space. Conrad declined to make news by announcing any new features.\n\nWhat will be interesting to see is how Zenefits manages to keep growing, while not losing its hunger.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "<a href=\"/author/alex-wilhelm/\" title=\"Posts by Alex Wilhelm\" onclick=\"s_objectID='river_author';\" rel=\"author\">Alex Wilhelm</a> <span class=\"twitter-handle\">(<a href=\"https://twitter.com/alex\" rel=\"external\">@alex</a>)</span>", "application-name": "TechCrunch", "twitter": {"description": "Today at Disrupt SF 2015, Zenefits\u2019 Parker Conrad joined our own Matthew Lynley on stage to dig into how the startup has managed to become one of the fastest-growing companies in the world.\u2026", "title": "Zenefits\u2019 Parker Conrad Talks Hyper Growth And How To Hang On\u2026", "url": "http://techcrunch.com/2015/09/21/zenefits-parker-conrad-talks-hyper-growth-and-how-to-hang-on-to-a-rocket-ship/", "image": {"src": "https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/zenefits-6.jpg?w=764&h=400&crop=1"}, "site": "@techcrunch", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "object_type": "post", "excerpt": "Today at Disrupt SF 2015, Zenefits\u2019 Parker Conrad joined our own Matthew Lynley on stage to dig into how the startup has managed to become one of the fastest-growing companies in the world.\nZenefits is notable here in the TechCrunch house as it first launched its product at Disrupt NY in 2013 when it was a finalist in our Startup Battlefield.", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "tag": "parker conrad", "sailthru.tags": "Zenefits, parker conrad", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://techcrunch.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/d9ea925a71f82f06a1e6224298f7fe80?s=16", "category": "TC", "generator": "WordPress.com", "author": "Alex Wilhelm", "sailthru.date": "2015-09-21 10:19:43", "og": {"site_name": "TechCrunch", "description": "Today at Disrupt SF 2015, Zenefits' Parker Conrad joined our own Matthew Lynley on stage to dig into how the startup has managed to become one of the..", "title": "Zenefits\u2019 Parker Conrad Talks Hyper Growth And How To Hang On To A Rocket\u00a0Ship", "url": "http://social.techcrunch.com/2015/09/21/zenefits-parker-conrad-talks-hyper-growth-and-how-to-hang-on-to-a-rocket-ship/", "image": "https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/zenefits-6.jpg?w=764&h=400&crop=1", "site": "social.techcrunch.com", "type": "article"}, "sailthru.title": "Zenefits\u2019 Parker Conrad Talks Hyper Growth And How To Hang On To A Rocket\u00a0Ship", "content": "Today at Disrupt SF 2015, Zenefits'\u00a0Parker Conrad joined our own Matthew Lynley on stage to dig into how the startup has managed to become one of the fastest-growing companies in the world.
