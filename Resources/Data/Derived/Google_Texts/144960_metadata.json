Contractors don\u2019t get the same benefits as employees, so they cost the companies less. Critics say that in some cases, the workers are closer to employees than contractors.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cOur current law provides a useful framework for understanding the rights and responsibilities of workers and employers,\u201d Perez said Monday evening during a Facebook question-and-answer session organized by the tech-based news site Engadget. \u201cI am concerned that some observers have framed a false choice of protecting workers OR promoting innovation in today's economy.\u201d\n\nThe Department of Labor (DOL) recently announced new guidelines meant to crack down on worker misclassification across the economy.\n\nStill, any reforms to the way workers are classified to better accommodate on-demand economy services would likely have to come from lawmakers, not the DOL \u2014 something Perez acknowledged. Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.) has said he is working on legislation to create a new safety net for the workers.\n\n\u201cMany people have discussed the need for a third category of employment,\u201d Perez said. \u201cSuch a solution would require legislative action from Congress.\u201d\n\nThe effect of the on-demand economy on workers, and economic inequality more broadly, has become a hotly contested topic.\n\nRepublicans have said that new regulation could stifle the growth of the companies, which have become some of the most valuable startups in the world, while many Democrats have taken a more cautious approach.\n\nDemocratic presidential candidate and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has said that workers are regularly misclassified, but has not tied that concern specifically to the on-demand economy. She said in an economic policy speech that companies like Uber are raising \u201chard questions\u201d about workplace protections.\n\nThose on the left, who have not yet taken a strong position on workers' status, may be treading carefully for fear of alienating Silicon Valley. In addition to being a potent symbol of American entrepreneurship, the tech industry has created a new class of wealthy political donors. Customers of on-demand economy services may also be put off by politicians who target services they use, tech advocates said.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Tom Perez said the rise of companies like Uber doesn't force a choice berween worker prorections and innovation.", "description": "Tom Perez said the rise of companies like Uber doesn't force a choice berween worker prorections and innovation.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "David McCabe", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "Tom Perez said the rise of companies like Uber doesn't force a choice berween worker prorections and innovation.", "title": "Labor secretary weighs in on 'gig economy'", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/technology/249421-labor-secretary-says-false-choice-between-innovation-and-worker-protection", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/blogs/perezthomas_090413getty.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-07-28T14:45:08-04:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2015-07-28T14:45-04:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/technology/249421-labor-secretary-says-false-choice-between-innovation-and-worker-protection", "dcterms.date": "2015-07-28T11:14-04:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "David McCabe", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "on-demand economy,Tom Perez,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-07-28T11:14:07-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-07-28T14:45:08-04:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/technology/249421-labor-secretary-says-false-choice-between-innovation-and-worker-protection", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "Tom Perez said the rise of companies like Uber doesn't force a choice berween worker prorections and innovation.", "card": "summary", "title": "Labor secretary weighs in on 'gig economy'"}, "dcterms.title": "Labor secretary weighs in on 'gig economy'"}, "article_summary": "Customers of on-demand economy services may also be put off by politicians who target services they use, tech advocates said.\nSecretary of Labor Tom Perez has decried what he calls a \u201cfalse choice\u201d between worker protections and innovation during a conversation about the burgeoning \"on-demand economy.\"\nDemocratic presidential candidate and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has said that workers are regularly misclassified, but has not tied that concern specifically to the on-demand economy.\n\u201cSuch a solution would require legislative action from Congress.\u201dThe effect of the on-demand economy on workers, and economic inequality more broadly, has become a hotly contested topic.\nStill, any reforms to the way workers are classified to better accommodate on-demand economy services would likely have to come from lawmakers, not the DOL \u2014 something Perez acknowledged."}
