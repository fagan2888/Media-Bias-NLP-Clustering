The president of a Christian school? The chancellor of a Christian university? Who\u2019s next?\u201d\n\nHuckabee also emphasized that this is not an \u201cisolated incident.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is what many of us said was going to happen when you start having the courts decide something that violates not only the conscience of a great many people but violates common sense,\u201d he said, emphasizing that the high court\u2019s same-sex marriage ruling was an act of judicial tyranny because they were \u201cjust making it up.\u201d\n\nHe praised Davis for having \u201cmore courage than virtually anybody in Congress, more than most pastors standing at a pulpit on this Sunday day.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s remarkable, and what is essentially stunning about it is she\u2019s a relatively new believer.\u201d Huckabee said, noting that Davis has \u201conly been a follower of Christ for the last four years\u201d and by her own admission \u201cshe had many areas of her life that were not what they should have been\u2026 and when she came to Christ she really felt an extraordinary sense of grace and forgiveness.\u201d\n\n\u201cHer conviction is stunning, inspiring, and it frankly puts most of us to shame,\u201d Huckabee said, adding that that is \u201call the more reason to believe that God has raised up Kim Davis to be the representative because she is maybe one of the most unlikely people\u2013a relatively new Christian, a country official in a small rural county in Kentucky and a Democrat.\u201d\n\nHuckabee also said he was \u201cstunned that people think that the courts can make a law.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe court doesn\u2019t have the constitutional authority to make law,\u201d he said.\n\nHuckabee cited St. Augustine, who said that an \u201cunjust law is no law at all,\u201d which as Huckabee noted was repeated by Martin Luther King in his Letter From a Birmingham Jail, and noted that Thomas Jefferson warned against judicial tyranny \u201cif we allow the courts to be the final arbiter of what a piece of legislation was.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s what we have today,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have judicial tyranny with the courts just making it up.\u201d\n\nHuckabee asked if the Supreme Court had ruled 5-4 against same-sex marriage, \u201cdo you think the left would be saying it\u2019s the law of land, let\u2019s shut the Human Rights Campaign down\u2026 and we\u2019re not going to protest and we\u2019re not going to ask for it anymore because that\u2019s the final word?\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Mike Huckabee: We Must Stand with Kim Davis Against 'Criminalization of Christianity'", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Mike Huckabee: We Must Stand with Kim Davis Against 'Criminalization of Christianity'", "title": "Mike Huckabee: We Must Stand with Kim Davis Against 'Criminalization of Christianity' - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 3099, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/09/ap_kim-davis_ap-photo3.jpg", "height": 3201}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/09/07/mike-huckabee-we-must-stand-with-kim-davis-against-criminalization-of-christianity/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Mike Huckabee: We Must Stand with Kim Davis Against 'Criminalization of Christianity'", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/09/ap_kim-davis_ap-photo3.jpg", "title": "Mike Huckabee: We Must Stand with Kim Davis Against 'Criminalization of Christianity' - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": ",2016 Presidential Race, Big Government,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "2016 Presidential Race", "published_time": "2015-09-07T05:10:49-07:00", "categories": "Big Government,2016 Presidential Race"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "\u201cWe need to show the country that not only do we stand with Kim Davis but that we stand against judicial tyranny,\u201d Huckabee said.\nThe chancellor of a Christian university?\nThe president of a Christian school?\n\u201cYour pastor?\nHuckabee cited St. Augustine, who said that an \u201cunjust law is no law at all,\u201d which as Huckabee noted was repeated by Martin Luther King in his Letter From a Birmingham Jail, and noted that Thomas Jefferson warned against judicial tyranny \u201cif we allow the courts to be the final arbiter of what a piece of legislation was.\u201d\u201cAnd that\u2019s what we have today,\u201d he said."}
