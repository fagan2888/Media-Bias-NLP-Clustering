John Kasich was at the Nob Hill home of Christine Hughes and Abe Ostrovsky on Thursday for a reception with a few dozen members of the Lincoln Club of Northern California.\n\nHughes is the club\u2019s vice chairwoman as well as chairwoman of the San Francisco Republican Party, president of the CalWatchdog Foundation, and a former vice president and board member of the conservative Pacific Research Institute. Ostrovsky is chief operating officer at Artkick. The Kasich event was free to club members and their guests.\n\nHughes and Ostrovsky also are scheduled to host Dr. Ben Carson for a cocktail reception at their home on the evening Tuesday, Sept. 8; tickets cost $250 per head, or $500 for those who want to attend a VIP photo opportunity first.\n\nUPDATE @ 10:45 A.M. FRIDAY: I now hear that Kasich had a fundraiser yesterday morning at the Stanford Park Hotel in Menlo Park, with about 100 people in attendance and venture capitalists Ted Schlein and Floyd Kvamme offering remarks. Kasich reportedly spoke about his successes in Congress and as Ohio\u2019s governor \u2013 the latter including a Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act \u2013 and said Donald Trump helped all GOP candidates by drawing 24 million viewers to the first debate early this month.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Political Blotter", "description": "A San Francisco couple\u2019s home seems to be becoming a key stop on the Republican presidential primary campaign trail.
