A Thursday night fundraiser at the Cresskill home of MWW Public Relations CEO Michael Kempner raised around $500,000 for Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign.

The event—which was $2,700 a head—drew attendees like Senate Majority Leader Loretta Weinberg, former U.S. Senator Bob Torricelli, Assemblywoman Valerie Huttle, NJDSC vice chair Lizette Delgado Polanco, John Graham, former Clinton speechwriter and rumored congressional candidate Josh Gottheimer, Duane Morris lobbyist and NJDSC Treasurer Kelly Maer and Bergen County Democratic Chairman Lou Stellato, among others.

Clinton’s remarks focused on the overwhelming support she has received in New Jersey. She thanked the room for the early endorsement of 20 county chairs and the legislative leadership. Her speech also touched on platform issues like paid family leave, Obamacare fixes and LGBT discrimination.
