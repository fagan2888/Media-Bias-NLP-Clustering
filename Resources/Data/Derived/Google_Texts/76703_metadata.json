That\u2019s according to an interview he gave to The Blaze\u2019s Glenn Beck:\n\nI actually have something I would use the department of education to do. It would be to monitor our institutions of higher education for extreme political bias and deny federal funding on that basis.\n\nWhat does Carson even mean? Would universities risk losing federal funding if professors, or student groups, demonstrated some kind of leftist bias?\n\nThis statement, if I\u2019m reading it correctly, should serve as a powerful reminder that many supposedly limited-government conservatives would actually use federal power to oppress people in ways remarkably similar to those on the left.\n\nPresident Obama\u2019s Education Department is currently engaged in an effort to force campuses to police sexual assault in ways that are manifestly unfair to the accuser. One of its rogue agencies has made up rule after rule putting unconstitutional limits on students\u2019 free speech rights in the name of stopping sexual harassment. These actions are wrong, and someone in elected office should challenge the organization.\n\nBut it would be equally wrong to use the Education Department to police speech that conservatives don\u2019t like. To the extent that Carson was serious about his suggestion, he deserves criticism.\n\nHat tip: The Daily Beast", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "Not a good idea", "title": "Ben Carson\u2019s Education Department Would Police Universities for Bias", "url": "http://reason.com/blog/2015/10/21/ben-carsons-education-department-would-p", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14454621124123.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Not a good idea", "title": "Ben Carson\u2019s Education Department Would Police Universities for Bias", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14454621124123.jpg", "creator": "@robbysoave", "site": "@reason", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 17548474116}, "article": {"tag": "Civil Liberties", "published_time": "2015-10-21T21:20:00+00:00", "author": "http://reason.com/people/robby-soave"}, "msvalidate.01": "212A68A07785B3080038A845C4EE8905", "google-site-verification": "-AmMiilAN-pnjWt369CUWae-VQ-b9wmH4fSGyhbkQxw", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2"}, "article_summary": "Unlike some conservatives, Ben Carson doesn\u2019t want to shut down the Education Department\u2014no, he wants to use it to punish universities that demonstrate \u201cextreme\u201d political bias.\nBut it would be equally wrong to use the Education Department to police speech that conservatives don\u2019t like.\nThat\u2019s according to an interview he gave to The Blaze\u2019s Glenn Beck:I actually have something I would use the department of education to do.\nPresident Obama\u2019s Education Department is currently engaged in an effort to force campuses to police sexual assault in ways that are manifestly unfair to the accuser.\nIt would be to monitor our institutions of higher education for extreme political bias and deny federal funding on that basis."}
