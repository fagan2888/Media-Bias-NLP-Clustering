Then they write their checks.\n\nOrganizations can win once a year, and those not selected can be nominated again.\n\n\u0093The less moving parts, the better,\u0094 Leone said. \u0093It\u0092s very quick, it\u0092s to the point and it\u0092s very beneficial to the organization that\u0092s chosen that evening.\u0094\n\nIn January, the group had 80 members who donated. Leone and Ryan credited Sheldon for donating, along with Dan Klimas, president of Lorain National Bank. Once the group topped $10,000, another donor added $5,000, for a total of $15,300.\n\nThe 100 Guys members also noted the 100 Women group donated $10,000 to the Free Clinic this quarter, for a total of $25,300 given for charitable health care in the county in 2015.\n\nThe Free Clinic started in 1986 and began serving the community in March 1987. It is located in the basement of Christ Lutheran Church, 3323 Pearl Ave. in South Lorain, with office hours at three other locations in Lorain, Elyria and Oberlin.\n\nIn 2014, the clinic logged 2,600 primary care patient visits and more than 7,000 medical service encounters with a rotating staff of 36 physicians and nurse practitioners, along with 75 specialists available for appointments.\n\nThe free clinic has an annual budget of about $380,000 a year and supplies about $3.6 million worth of health care a year, Baumgartner said.\n\nThe reputation of the clinic is one of the reasons it was selected, Sheldon said.\n\n\u0093One, is that it\u0092s been here a long time doing its mission,\u0094 he said. \u0093We know its value. We know it works.\u0094\n\nThe Affordable Care Act does not supplant the need for a free clinic, Sheldon said. People \u0093think the need for these things is going away,\u0094 he said.\n\nBefore the Affordable Care Act, about 85 percent of the population had some form of health care coverage, Sheldon said.\n\nWith the ACA, it is projected about 95 percent of people will get coverage, Sheldon said.\n\nBut that means 5 percent of people won\u0092t have health insurance, and using the estimated percentages, Lorain County could have 15,000 or more people without health coverage among the county\u0092s population of about 300,000 people, Sheldon said.\n\n\u0093Even when the Affordable Care Act is optimally implemented, they still need care,\u0094 he said.\n\nSome people qualified for Medicaid based on broader criteria for coverage, but they may not qualify again when that coverage is up for renewal, Baumgartner said.\n\nThe 100 Guys\u0092 first recipient was Genesis House Domestic Violence Center of Lorain County.\n\n100 Guys will meet again at 7 p.m. April 9 at Quaker Steak & Lube in Sheffield Village, 4900 Transportation Drive. Leone said he hopes to grow 100 guys to 250 members.\n\nFor more information:\n\n\u0095 http://100guyslorain.net/\n\n\u0095 http://www.100womenloraincounty.org/index.html\n\n\u0095 http://www.lcfreeclinic.org/", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "News, Lorain news, OH news, US news, world news.", "title": "100 Guys Who Care donate $15,300 to Lorain County Free Clinic", "og": {"url": "http://www.morningjournal.com/article/MJ/20150215/NEWS/150219774", "image": {"width": "600px", "identifier": "http://www.morningjournal.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/MJ/20150215/NEWS/150219774/AR/0/AR-150219774.jpg?Maxh=1500&Maxw=1500", "height": "450px"}, "type": "article", "title": "100 Guys Who Care donate $15,300 to Lorain County Free Clinic"}, "twitter": {"domain": "morningjournal.com", "description": "Friday the 13th became a lucky day for the Lorain County Free Clinic when it received a donation of $15,300 to help pay for medicine and health care for its patients.", "title": "100 Guys Who Care donate $15,300 to Lorain County Free Clinic", "url": "http://www.morningjournal.com/article/MJ/20150215/NEWS/150219774", "image": {"src": "http://www.morningjournal.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/MJ/20150215/NEWS/150219774/AR/0/AR-150219774.jpg?Maxh=900&Maxw=900"}, "site": "@morningjournal", "app": {"id": {"ipad": "id563961385", "iphone": "id520205939", "googleplay": "com.spreedinc.providers.digitalfirstmedia.morningjournal"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "keywords": "News, Lorain news, OH news, US news, world news.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "description": "Friday the 13th became a lucky day for the Lorain County Free Clinic when it received a donation of $15,300 to help pay for medicine and health care for its patients."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdcfb6\"", "article_summary": "The 100 Guys formed in 2014 and is modeled after the group 100 Women Who Care About Lorain County, which started in August 2010.\nFriday the 13th became a lucky day for the Lorain County Free Clinic when it received a donation of $15,300 to help pay for medicine and health care for its patients.\nThe group 100 Guys Who Care About Lorain County donated a packet of checks their members gave as part of its quarterly donation program.\nThe 100 Guys\u0092 first recipient was Genesis House Domestic Violence Center of Lorain County.\nFor the 100 guys, members meet for about an hour to nominate good causes, then pick three of those in a random drawing."}
