On the eve of the New York primary, Hillary Clinton will go on national TV to talk about the "small issues" facing the country.

The former Secretary of State will be on the "Late Show with Stephen Colbert" on Monday night â€” and she's promising to keep it light.

"The past year I've been talking about the biggest issues facing Americans," Clinton said in a promo released Friday with Colbert.

"But right now we'd like to take a moment to talk about some of the smallest issues facing Americans," said Colbert, who joins her in the 90-second promo.

Among the topics, according to Clinton, will be the signs on the ladies room.

"Why does the woman on the women's bathroom sign have on that poofy dress? Nobody wears that," she said.

They'll also talk about health care, but the Affordable Care Act won't be mentioned.

"All Americans should have access to health care," she said. "Ideally whatever Rob Lowe is getting. That guy looks amazing."
