He paid his way through school, and went on to start a small business.\u201d\n\nAt the same moment, across town, Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) was telling his own parents\u2019 coming-to-America story. Describing how they found work in local casinos when he was a child \u2014 his father as a bartender and his mother as a maid \u2014 he said, \u201cLas Vegas for us will always be a place of new beginning and second chances.\u201d\n\nThe Nevada audiences at Cruz\u2019s and Rubio\u2019s events have been overwhelmingly white, but the few Latino attendees told ThinkProgress the candidates are resonating with them.\n\n\u201cI think [Rubio is] a big supporter of the Hispanic community because of his background,\u201d said Rocio Estrella, who has lived in Las Vegas for 24 years. \u201cOut of all the candidates running in the Republican Party, he\u2019s the one that\u2019s going to give immigrants more of a chance to make their American dream, just like his parents did for him. I know he\u2019s not going to separate families.\u201d\n\nRodrigo Sanchez, an Air Force veteran whose parents and grandparents immigrated from Costa Rica, agreed. \u201cWhen I see Marco, I see myself,\u201d he said. \u201cLike him, I\u2019ve dealt with the circumstances of struggle, and because of my parents I\u2019ve been able to get to a better place. He\u2019s been able to live his version of the American dream, becoming a senator and now running for president. And he knows the American dream is now under attack.\u201d\n\nThe Las Vegas rally was Sanchez\u2019s third Rubio event. He told ThinkProgress that not only does he back the candidate\u2019s plan to cut corporate taxes and get rid of environmental regulations, he thinks Rubio\u2019s family background makes him more open to immigration reform.\n\n\u201cYou have people who have been trying to come to this country legally and they\u2019re still waiting in line,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be hard for us to deport everyone. And the ones who are here who want to contribute and work hard, I think he has a plan to get them legal permanent residency and potentially to become a citizen.\u201d\n\nRubio does not have such a plan. In fact, the freshman senator who once co-sponsored a comprehensive immigration reform bill now calls such a plan impossible. He has promised, if elected, to never create a path to citizenship, and to deport the DREAMers currently protected by an executive order. Cruz holds similar views, and has added that he would hire Donald Trump to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border. Neither has forcefully condemned Trump characterizing Latino immigrants as bearers of crime, drugs, and disease.\n\nProgressive Latinos in Nevada say Cruz and Trump are not only alienating voters of color in the state, they\u2019re betraying them.\n\n\u201cMarco Rubio and Ted Cruz ended up being traitors to our community,\u201d said Astrid Silva, a Las Vegas DREAMer who recently joined Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign. \u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate they are Latinos. They\u2019re trying so hard to fit in with the Republican Party that they\u2019re turning their backs on all of our families.\u201d\n\nAnother Nevada DREAMer, Erika Castro, added, \u201cDonald Trump has a hateful message, but he\u2019s just a lot of talk. Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio have actually worked against our families. My brother, who is a U.S. citizen, is watching and listening. And those of us who are committed to becoming citizens, us future voters, we are listening to what they\u2019re saying.\u201d\n\nEmily Zamora, whose mother immigrated from Brazil, told ThinkProgress she feels Cruz and Rubio take the Latino vote for granted. \u201cThey think they have our vote, but they don\u2019t,\u201d she said. \u201cThey are very successful now, but they should remember that they were struggling immigrant families once.\u201d\n\nMarco Rubio stresses his own family\u2019s immigrant experience in a speech in North Las Vegas.

Hong\n\nCandidates and pundits on both ends of the political spectrum have stressed that Latinos are not single-issue voters, and will make a decision in November based on more than immigration policy alone. But Zamora and other Las Vegas Latinos told ThinkProgress that Rubio and Cruz are similarly out of line with their community on a range of issues.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re concerned about student loan debt, access to health care, making a livable wage, and passing immigration reform,\u201d she said. \u201cIf these candidates aren\u2019t going to support these issues then they are not going to be our president.\u201d\n\nPolling supports Zamora\u2019s prediction. Latino voters nationwide overwhelmingly support raising the minimum wage, which Cruz and Rubio do not support, and a strong majority support the Affordable Care Act, which Cruz and Rubio have promised to repeal. Nearly three quarters also want national standards to prevent global warming and climate change, which Cruz and Rubio have vowed to dismantle.\n\nNearly 30 percent of Nevada residents are Latino, including 17 percent of eligible voters, according to Pew. While the vast majority are Democrats \u2014 President Obama won 70 percent of the Latino vote in 2012 \u2014 conservative Latinos tell ThinkProgress they hope to have a major impact in Tuesday\u2019s caucuses.\n\n\u201cJust because I\u2019m Hispanic people assume I\u2019m going to vote Democrat. Far from it,\u201d Sanchez said. \u201cI definitely feel that stigma, but I believe there\u2019s a lot of conservatives in the Latino community who believe in family values and the kind of thought process of people like Marco Rubio.\u201d\n\nHenderson resident Rita Bonilla, who identifies as an American of Mexican ancestry, says she also feels a stigma for backing Republicans, but is so passionately opposed to immigration reform that she doesn\u2019t care.\n\n\u201cMexico is not sending doctors and lawyers here,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is dragging our country down, because we are paying to bring the children of these people up to the level of our own American children. They come over here and have four or five children, which we call anchor babies.\u201d\n\nBonilla, who has volunteered with armed vigilante Minutemen on the U.S.-Mexico border, told ThinkProgress she was supporting Trump before Cruz won her over on Sunday night. \u201cI can sense and feel that he is a man who is dedicated to this country, and he feels the way that I feel: that we are losing our country,\u201d she said.\n\nYet she lamented that she was one of just a small handful of Latinos among the hundreds of people attending the rally. \u201cWhy aren\u2019t there any minorities here? Because the minorities want everything for free. That\u2019s how the Democrats get them. Free phones, free food stamps, free medical [care]. They\u2019re scared to death that Senator Cruz will take that away.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "\"Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz ended up being traitors to our community.\"", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "\"Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz ended up being traitors to our community.\"", "title": "Nevada Latinos Explain Their Support For Marco Rubio And Ted Cruz", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/politics/2016/02/22/3731989/cruz-rubio-nevada-latinos/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/22110506/CruzFans-600x315.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "\"Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz ended up being traitors to our community.\"", "creator": "@AliceOllstein", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/22110506/CruzFans-321x214.jpg", "title": "Nevada Latinos Explain Their Support For Marco Rubio And Ted Cruz", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-politics", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/22110506/CruzFans-540x303.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/22110506/CruzFans-99x66.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2016-02-22T13:23:49+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/AliceMOllstein"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "article_summary": "Latino voters nationwide overwhelmingly support raising the minimum wage, which Cruz and Rubio do not support, and a strong majority support the Affordable Care Act, which Cruz and Rubio have promised to repeal.\n\u201cHe was 18 years old, couldn\u2019t speak English, and has $100 sewn into his underwear,\u201d Cruz told the rapt crowd.\nBut Zamora and other Las Vegas Latinos told ThinkProgress that Rubio and Cruz are similarly out of line with their community on a range of issues.\n\u201cMarco Rubio and Ted Cruz ended up being traitors to our community,\u201d said Astrid Silva, a Las Vegas DREAMer who recently joined Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign.\nAnd he knows the American dream is now under attack.\u201dThe Las Vegas rally was Sanchez\u2019s third Rubio event."}
