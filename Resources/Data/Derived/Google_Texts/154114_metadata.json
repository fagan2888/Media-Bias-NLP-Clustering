They go into effect on Dec. 1.\n\nThe rules stem from the Dodd-Frank financial reform law passed in 2010.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "The CFPB is bringing the companies in line with banks under the regulations.", "description": "The CFPB is bringing the companies in line with banks under the regulations.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Tim Devaney", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "The CFPB is bringing the companies in line with banks under the regulations.", "title": "New rules target money transfer companies", "url": "http://thehill.com/regulation/217569-new-rules-target-western-union-money-transfer-companies", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/thehill_logo_200.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-04T04:20:37-05:00", "type": "article"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-04T04:20-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/regulation/217569-new-rules-target-western-union-money-transfer-companies", "dcterms.date": "2014-09-12T13:23-04:00", "dcterms.creator": "Tim Devaney", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": ",,", "article": {"published_time": "2014-09-12T13:23:24-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-04T04:20:37-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/regulation/217569-new-rules-target-western-union-money-transfer-companies", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "The CFPB is bringing the companies in line with banks under the regulations.", "card": "summary", "title": "New rules target money transfer companies"}, "dcterms.title": "New rules target money transfer companies"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9a4b\"", "article_summary": "Western Union, MoneyGram and more than 20 other international money transfer companies are the target of new rules from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.\nBut the rules would only apply to a couple dozen larger money transfer companies that make more than 1 million international money transfers each year.\nADVERTISEMENTThe same rules already apply to banks and credit unions, but up to this point international money transfer companies have been exempt.\nThe CFPB proposed expanding the rules to money transfer companies in January.\n\u201cLast year, our new protections for consumers sending money abroad took effect,\u201d said CFPB Director Richard Cordray."}
