Two Maui police officers will be honored with the Kahuola Award, presented by the Maui Fire and Public Safety Commission and the Maui Fire Chief during an upcoming meeting.

Officers Joshua Kalb and Erik Losvar are being recognized for their actions during a structure fire at the Kāʻanapali Royale condominium on June 12, 2013, in which they entered a burning unit and pulled out the lone male occupant from within.

This is the second time Officer Losvar is being honored with pulling residents from a burning structure. In July 2011, Officer Losvar joined Officer Jun Hattori in repeatedly entering a Kelawea Street home in Lahaina to carry victims to safety. Both officers were awarded the Silver Medal of Valor for that incident.

Joshua Kalb has been with the Maui Police Department for four years, joining the department in December of 2009 as a member of the 71st Recruit Class.

The Kahuola Award, literally translated as “Guardian of Life” recognizes those who go beyond the call of duty by performing a selfless act that is intended to preserve or save a life.

Fire officials say the resident involved in the condominium fire, later identified as an 84-year-old Lahaina man, was initially listed in serious condition, but died after being transported to Straub Hospital on Oʻahu for care.

The Kahu’ola Award is one of two distinctive honors issued by the commission—the other is the Kahuʻāina Award, which recognizes nominees for providing assistance in the preservation of land or property.

Nominations are presented to the fire chief, and are forwarded to the Fire and Public Safety Commission for review.

Maui Fire Chief Jeffrey Murray said, “It is important to recognize the people that go above and beyond community service.”

The Kahuola Award Ceremony will be held on Thursday, March 6.
