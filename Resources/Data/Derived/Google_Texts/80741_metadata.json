It is a highlight and tradition for many in the South Dallas community.\n\nBorn and raised in the area, Joseph Howard, 63, said he attends the parade every year despite no longer living there.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a blessing to be able to be out here,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is home.\u201d\n\nMikele\u2019s mother, Danisia Medlock, said the parade has become a community event at which folks are likely to see old friends and relatives.\n\n\u201cYou see people you haven\u2019t seen in years. You may even see a family member,\u201d she said. \u201cIt grows every year, too. It\u2019s bigger today.\u201d\n\nAbout 50 volunteers helped with Saturday\u2019s parade, said Clara Brown-Trimble, vice chair of the MLK celebration committee.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m thankful our community is out here to celebrate with us,\u201d she said.\n\nThe march included about 130 organizations and groups, Brown-Trimble said. Fraternal organizations, dance groups, school bands, and representatives from other local events like the Chinese Lantern Festival all took part.\n\n\u201cWe had many young people in the march,\u201d said Patrick Jackson, manager of the MLK Jr. Community Center. \u201cDr. King\u2019s vision is just as important today. People believe, and they\u2019re willing to work together.\u201d\n\nDozens of elected officials and candidates were among thousands who attended. Among them was state Sen. Wendy Davis of Fort Worth, a Democratic candidate for governor.\n\nDavis said King\u2019s message embodies her campaign and her goals as a public servant.\n\n\u201cHe taught us all to dream of the opportunity that we could take advantage of,\u201d Davis said. \u201cWhere you start shouldn\u2019t define where you\u2019re headed.\u201d\n\nAfter the parade, a health fair at the community center gave residents the chance to learn about the Affordable Care Act and to sign up for health coverage.\n\nThe health fair was added this year because health care was an important issue to King, said Joyce Campbell, the fair\u2019s coordinator.\n\n\u201cThis was a strategic move by the center,\u201d Campbell said. \u201cWhen health care reform was passed in 2010, that\u2019s part of undoing injustice. We felt it was appropriate and fitting.\u201d\n\nCampbell said that next month, the community center hopes to provide on-site help for people wanting to learn more about the health care law.\n\nLongtime parade attendee Claudette Small of Cedar Hill, who was with her nieces Saturday morning, said she wants to instill in them a sense of understanding of King\u2019s historical importance.\n\n\u201cI want them to take away that his dream is still alive,\u201d she said. \u201cThey know the importance of our black history.\u201d\n\nMichelle White, who carried her 3-year-old daughter, Mackenzie, agreed.\n\n\u201cThis is my daughter\u2019s first time here,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is our history. He made a difference.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "New to this year\u2019s festivities was a health fair, which was added to provide information on the Affordable Care Act.", "og": {"description": "New to this year\u2019s festivities was a health fair, which was added to provide information on the Affordable Care Act.", "title": "Thousands attend annual MLK Jr. Parade in Dallas", "url": "http://www.dallasnews.com/news/metro/20140118-thousands-attend-annual-mlk-jr.-parade-in-dallas.ece", "image": {"width": 670, "identifier": "http://www.dallasnews.com/incoming/20140118-mlk_cover-1.jpg.ece/BINARY/original/MLK_COVER+1.jpg", "height": 516}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "type": "article"}, "LastModifiedDate": "2014-01-19T04:26:51Z", "twitter": {"site": "@dallasnews", "card": "summary", "creator": "@dallasnews"}, "PublishDate": "2014-01-19T04:02:33Z", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Thousands attend annual MLK Jr. Parade in Dallas\", \"link\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/news/metro/20140118-thousands-attend-annual-mlk-jr.-parade-in-dallas.ece\", \"image_url\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/incoming/20140118-mlk_cover-1.jpg.ece/BINARY/original/MLK_COVER+1.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"1391894\", \"pub_date\": \"2014-01-19T04:02:33Z\", \"section\": \"Metro\", \"author\": \"JULISSA TREVI\\u00D1O\", \"tags\": [\"dallas\", \"dallas fort worth\", \"dallas news\", \"dallas fort worth news\", \"dfw news\", \"dallas local news\", \"dallas fort worth local news\", \"dallas newspaper\", \"dallas morning news\", \"dallas morning news newspaper\"]}", "fb": {"admins": 1043783589, "page_id": 20946638799, "app_id": 258290334265148}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "cXenseParse": {"recs": {"image": "http://www.dallasnews.com/incoming/20140118-mlk_cover-1.jpg.ece/ALTERNATES/w660/MLK_COVER+1.jpg", "publishtime": "2014-01-19T04:02:33Z"}}, "news_keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe270e\"", "article_summary": "\u201cWe had many young people in the march,\u201d said Patrick Jackson, manager of the MLK Jr. Community Center.\nThe parade was part of a weekend celebration of King\u2019s life and achievements and was hosted by the city of Dallas and the MLK Jr. Community Center.\nIt is a highlight and tradition for many in the South Dallas community.\nThe health fair was added this year because health care was an important issue to King, said Joyce Campbell, the fair\u2019s coordinator.\n\u201cWhen health care reform was passed in 2010, that\u2019s part of undoing injustice."}
