Endless reminders on social media were coupled with everything from the setup of mall kiosks during the holiday season to phone banks to bus tours to petting zoos and prison visits.\n\nHey St. Louis @covermissouri Very creative Kickoff event!

So what\u2019s this business about another special enrollment period?\n\nKaiser Health News senior correspondent Anna Gorman is teasing the yet-to-be scheduled signup event.\n\nCalifornia considering special enrollment for folks who see their tax penalties and don't like them. But Peter Lee says deadlines matter. \u2014 Anna Gorman (@annagorman) February 17, 2015\n\nThe Daily Signal has a closer look at the plan.\n\n\u2026California, New York and Kentucky are considering their own grace periods aimed at consumers who may not have realized they will pay a fine for not having health insurance. \u201cThis is a teachable moment,\u201d Peter Lee, executive director of California\u2019s exchange, Covered California, said. \u201cThis is the first time ever in our history that health care and taxes are totally intertwined.\u201d\n\nHealth care and taxes are totally intertwined? Didn\u2019t President Obama himself insist that the health insurance mandate was a penalty, and \u201cabsolutely not a tax increase\u201d? We guess that was just another teachable moment too.\n\nBut another change to the rules just for those who \u201cdon\u2019t like\u201d their tax penalties? Is that legal? Washington and Lee University School of Law professor Timothy Jost says the law grants the Department of Health and Human Services secretary the authority to create special enrollment periods in \u201cexceptional\u201d circumstances.\n\n[Jost] told The Daily Signal because this is the first year the uninsured have incurred a fine for not having coverage, it qualifies as an exceptional circumstance. \u201cFor a lot of people who have not yet filed their taxes, and that includes most Americans, people are going to realize that this penalty is there,\u201d Jost said.\n\nSo, when\u2019s the special Obamacare repeal period for those of us who don\u2019t \u201clike\u201d our health care and taxes totally intertwined?", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "title": "Special Obamacare enrollment window considered for those who suffer tax penalty shock - twitchy.com", "og": {"site_name": "twitchy.com", "description": "Who wasn't aware by now that there's a penalty?", "title": "Special Obamacare enrollment window considered for those who suffer tax penalty shock - twitchy.com", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://twitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/obamacare-going-to-hurt.jpg", "url": "http://twitchy.com/brettt-3136/2015/02/19/special-obamacare-enrollment-window-considered-for-those-who-suffer-tax-penalty-shock/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "twitchy.com", "image": "http://twitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/obamacare-going-to-hurt.jpg", "description": "Who wasn't aware by now that there's a penalty?", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Special Obamacare enrollment window considered for those who suffer tax penalty shock - twitchy.com"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://twitchy.com/wp-content/themes/twitchy2016/images/favicon/smalltile.png", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://twitchy.com/wp-content/themes/twitchy2016/images/favicon/largetile.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://twitchy.com/wp-content/themes/twitchy2016/images/favicon/widetile.png", "article": {"section": "US Politics", "tag": "tax penalty", "published_time": "2015-02-19T21:44:27+00:00"}, "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://twitchy.com/wp-content/themes/twitchy2016/images/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1ca2\"", "article_summary": "Great enrollment #s #TBT #11MillionAndCounting pic.twitter.com/WulqIbDKpo \u2014 HHSRegion7 (@HHSRegion7) February 19, 2015Offenders nearing release taking responsibility for family & self.\nACF @HHSRegion7 was there#TBT#11MillionAndCounting pic.twitter.com/a9Hx5NFc20 \u2014 HHSRegion7 (@HHSRegion7) February 19, 2015Another round of computer glitches extended the deadline slightly further for those who attempted to sign up in time but weren\u2019t able to complete the application.\nSo, when\u2019s the special Obamacare repeal period for those of us who don\u2019t \u201clike\u201d our health care and taxes totally intertwined?\n\u201cThis is the first time ever in our history that health care and taxes are totally intertwined.\u201dHealth care and taxes are totally intertwined?\nSo what\u2019s this business about another special enrollment period?"}
