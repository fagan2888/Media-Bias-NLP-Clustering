Medicare Administrator Marilyn Tavenner updated the numbers at a hearing Thursday before the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee.\n\nAs expected, the latest figures showed slippage.

She expects total enrollment to remain basically stable until the next open enrollment season starts Nov. 15. After a chaotic launch, the numbers are still positive for the administration. Enrollment is projected to grow next year.\n\nPlay Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nGoogle Plus\n\nEmbed Chuck Todd Crunches Obamacare Numbers 1:50 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog\n\nIN-DEPTH\n\n-The Associated Press", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Obama administration says 7.3 million people have signed up for subsidized private health insurance under the health care law.", "og": {"url": "http://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-care/obamacare-enrollment-now-7-3-million-government-says-n206481", "type": "article", "image": "http://media1.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2014_36/230576/140305-obamacare_site-1526_d6c903838b96f4b0afdec2627011fc98.nbcnews-fp-1200-800.jpg", "site_name": "NBC News", "description": "The Obama administration says 7.3 million people have signed up for subsidized private health insurance under the health care law."}, "twitter": {"domain": "NBCNews.com", "description": "The Obama administration says 7.3 million people have signed up for subsidized private health insurance under the health care law.", "creator": "NBCNews", "image": {"src": "http://media1.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2014_36/230576/140305-obamacare_site-1526_d6c903838b96f4b0afdec2627011fc98.nbcnews-fp-1200-800.jpg"}, "title": "Obamacare Enrollment Now 7.3 Million, Government Says - NBC News", "site": "NBCNews", "card": "summary"}, "blitz": "mu-e1e842c9-946002e6-ea8f0454-41b29546", "DC.date.issued": "2014-09-18", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=319740707, app-argument=http://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-care/obamacare-enrollment-now-7-3-million-government-says-n206481", "fb": {"app_id": 10150138890205613}, "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/NBCNews"}, "google-site-verification": "K8bowvEbzWfPQ76x6f9SCxMVwicVXrhiClRg80ak8ZA", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Health,Health Care,Obamacare"}, "_id": "\"57477afa6914bd0286fe64cd\"", "article_summary": "Play FacebookTwitterGoogle PlusEmbed Chuck Todd Crunches Obamacare Numbers 1:50 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blogIN-DEPTH-The Associated Press\nThe Obama administration says 7.3 million people have signed up for subsidized private health insurance under the health care law \u2014 down from 8 million reported earlier this year.\nShe expects total enrollment to remain basically stable until the next open enrollment season starts Nov. 15.\nMedicare Administrator Marilyn Tavenner updated the numbers at a hearing Thursday before the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee.\nTavenner, whose agency oversees HealthCare.gov, said the new count represents paying customers as of Aug. 15."}
