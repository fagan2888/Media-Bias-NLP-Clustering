It\u2019s always a tricky injury and just trying to manage it and everything else, but the doctors and trainers did a great job of just doing the things necessary to get me back out on the field.\u201d\n\nWelker first suffered a concussion Nov. 17 during a game against Kansas City. He passed the NFL\u2019s concussion protocol tests and was cleared to play in the next game, Nov. 24 against his former team, New England.\n\nWelker also played Dec. 1 in a rematch with Kansas City. He was crossing the middle for a Peyton Manning pass against Tennessee on Dec. 8 when he was hit by Titans safety Bernard Pollard.\n\nThat concussion knocked Welker out of the game and he was held out of the Broncos\u2019 final three regular-season games. He finished with 73 catches, his lowest total in seven years. But his 10 touchdown receptions were a personal best.\n\nWelker was cleared for full football activity this week. He will play in the Broncos\u2019 playoff opener Jan. 12 at Sports Authority Field at Mile High against Indianapolis, Kansas City or San Diego.\n\nStill, with all the numbing information that has come out in recent years about the long-term effects of concussions, there is concern as to whether Welker should play at all this postseason.\n\n\u201cOf course, you\u2019re always concerned any time you get a concussion,\u201d Welker said. \u201cReally, I feel good. I think we\u2019ve taken a lot more action than what we would have in the past with this whole ordeal. I think we\u2019ve taken enough time. It will be five weeks from the day I had any contact at all. I feel good. I feel fine. I\u2019m ready to go.\u201d\n\nMike Klis: mklis@denverpost.com or twitter.com/mikeklis", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Wes Welker \u201cready to go\u201d for Broncos after recovery from concussions", "title": "Wes Welker \u201cready to go\u201d for Broncos after recovery from concussions", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/01/02/wes-welker-ready-to-go-for-broncos-after-recovery-from-concussions/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20131211__wes-welker-broncos-121113ap1.jpg", "height": 573}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20131211__wes-welker-broncos-121113ap1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-01-02T13:39:05+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-28T02:19:52+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "I think we\u2019ve taken a lot more action than what we would have in the past with this whole ordeal.\n\u201cOf course, you\u2019re always concerned any time you get a concussion,\u201d Welker said.\nThere was a time when Wes Welker was recovering from his second concussion that he felt he was ready to play.\nThat concussion knocked Welker out of the game and he was held out of the Broncos\u2019 final three regular-season games.\nWelker also played Dec. 1 in a rematch with Kansas City."}
