Without any warning, I was involved in a head-on collision with another man also texting while walking.\n\nThe thud sent both of us off balance and we almost fell. As we both regained our footing, we looked at each other with disgust and embarrassment.\n\nAccording to a 2013 research report compiled by Liberty Mutual Insurance, 70 percent of people in the United States admit to texting and walking.\n\n\u201cSo much attention has been paid, and rightly so, to distracted driving that we have ignored the fact that distracted walking and crossing can be just as risky,\u201d wrote David Melton, a driving safety expert with Liberty Mutual.\n\nYouTube is home to thousands of compilation videos of epic texting-and-walking fails. Like the people who slam into glass doors, closed elevators and parked cars. The zombies who head-butt streetlight poles and phone booths.\n\nAccording to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, distracted pedestrians are involved in thousands of accidents and even fatalities each year.\n\nDr. Dietrich Jehle, a professor of emergency medicine at the University at Buffalo in New York, estimates that of those tens of thousands of pedestrian-related emergency room visits, 10 percent are a result of texting while walking. People end up with broken legs and concussions, to name a few serious injuries.\n\nIf you\u2019re one of the people who pride yourself on being an expert at this task, there is lot of research that shows you\u2019re actually not. A 2014 study in the medical journal PLOS One found that walking and using your smartphone at the same time affects people\u2019s posture and balance, causing them to swerve and walk slower. (In other words, you look like a person who\u2019s had six too many drinks.) A few weeks after my JFK incident, I was walking through San Francisco with my colleague David Carr, and as people neared us typing on their phone, heads pointed to their navel, Carr did something I hadn\u2019t seen anyone do before. Instead of moving out of these people\u2019s way to let them pass, he would go forward and tense up like a linebacker, becoming a brick wall for people to walk right into.\n\nAs he aptly noted each time, what these people were doing was rude and inconsiderate; it wasn\u2019t his responsibility to get out of the way. And he\u2019s absolutely right.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://health.heraldtribune.com/files/2015/01/hfwell20.jpg"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca5aa\"", "article_summary": "Without any warning, I was involved in a head-on collision with another man also texting while walking.\nAccording to a 2013 research report compiled by Liberty Mutual Insurance, 70 percent of people in the United States admit to texting and walking.\nIn 2015, I\u2019m going to stop texting while walking.\nDr. Dietrich Jehle, a professor of emergency medicine at the University at Buffalo in New York, estimates that of those tens of thousands of pedestrian-related emergency room visits, 10 percent are a result of texting while walking.\n\u201cSo much attention has been paid, and rightly so, to distracted driving that we have ignored the fact that distracted walking and crossing can be just as risky,\u201d wrote David Melton, a driving safety expert with Liberty Mutual."}
