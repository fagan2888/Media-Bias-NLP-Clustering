Tim Huelskamp and his staff members during the congressman\u2019s recent tour of Kansas\u2019 first district. Hilger was also featured in a video interview released by Huelskamp\u2019s office Tuesday, in which the pharmacist cuts straight through the politics and lays it out flat: Obamacare is hurting his business, Gregwire Drug Store, which has served citizens of Russell for more than a century.\n\nFor one, he told Kansas Watchdog, his employee insurance premiums are set to skyrocket from around $2,000 a month to more than $5,000 next year. It\u2019s one of the negative ramifications of the new health care law he feels is being wholly ignored by national media outlets. Further hampering his business is the fact that Obamacare cuts into his bottom line by reducing provider reimbursements.\n\nWhile grocery stores and retailers can simply increase prices to offset the rise in health care costs, Hilger said small pharmacies like his don\u2019t have that luxury.\n\n\u201cMy reimbursement has dropped every year for years,\u201d Hilger said. \u201cI get paid less and less as the time goes on, and I have no control over that, because (the price is) being dictated to me by somebody somewhere else.\u201d\n\nHilger controls the price on roughly 10 percent of his inventory.\n\nAnother consequence of the bureaucratic and regulatory expansion is that minor errors can cause big problems for small pharmacies like Gregwire. Hilger cited a recent $200 Medicare claim that was rejected because of a typo.\n\n\u201cHere we are, about 16 months later, and I cannot get that fixed,\u201d Hilger said. \u201cThey will not accept the fact that there was a typographical error. I\u2019ve proven it to them a number of times. They just simply refuse to pay that claim. They\u2019re calling it fraudulent because I have a typo.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is the kind of thing that our government is doing to small business providers like me,\u201d he added.\n\nRelated: As Obamacare exchange date looms, Kansas is cautiously optimistic\n\nContact Travis Perry at travis@kansaswatchdog.org, or follow him on Twitter at @muckraker62.
