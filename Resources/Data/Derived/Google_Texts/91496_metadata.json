But they aren\u2019t as unified in supporting some of the right wing's tactics.\n\nHow Uber knows your phone battery is dying and more\n\nRep. Tim Huelskamp (c.) and his son, Alexander (r.), talk with Kenny Roelofsen, part owner of Abilene Machine in Abilene, Kan. Mr. Roelofsen, a young Republican, recently moderated a panel discussion on the future of the GOP.\n\nIt was the question that sparked applause at an eatery here in Leonardville, Kan., (pop. 449).\n\nCould the congressman please explain what the House Freedom Caucus is, and how it\u2019s benefited the state?\n\nThat set off a passionate response by Rep. Tim Huelskamp, the Republican who represents the vast First District of central and western Kansas. Elected in the tea party wave of 2010, he\u2019s proud to belong to the hard-line Freedom Caucus, whose nearly 40 members helped drive Speaker John Boehner into early retirement last month.\n\nRecommended: So you think you know Congress? Take our quiz.\n\nRepresentative Huelskamp described the caucus as conservatives who have been \u201cpunished,\u201d \u201cmarginalized,\u201d or \u201cverbally attacked\u201d by the Washington establishment, and who seek a greater say in how the House is run. He held himself up as Exhibit A: He says he was kicked off the Agriculture Committee in 2012 \u201cbecause I didn\u2019t vote the way the speaker wanted me to vote.\u201d He was also kicked off the Budget Committee.\n\nIt\u2019s the first time in more than a century that the Sunflower State has been without a member on the powerful \u201cag\u201d committee. But to supporters of Huelskamp, his exile looks like a badge of honor. When he delivered his big line at the Leonardville eatery \u2013 \u201cI work for you,\u201d not the speaker \u2013 the crowd clapped with robust approval.\n\nDarn straight the congressman works for them. He\u2019s doing exactly what many of his constituents want \u2013 standing up against the establishment, sticking to his guns. For instance, he\u2019s voted against the various bipartisan budget and fiscal deals that have pulled the country back from the brink of shutdown or debt default. The deals weren\u2019t stringent enough. They didn\u2019t defund Planned Parenthood.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m proud of Tim,\u201d said Chris Tawney, meeting at a table with a few of her tea party friends after the town hall meeting. \u201cHe said from the first day he was elected where he stood on issues, and he has stayed there.\u201d\n\nIn Kansas, as in the tumultuous House, the divide within the GOP is less over policy and more over tactics. Talk to Republicans in \u201cThe Big First\u201d district \u2013 about the size of Illinois and among the 20 most Republican districts in the United States \u2013 and you\u2019ll hear over and over that most of them agree with the conservative views of Huelskamp.\n\nIt\u2019s his unwillingness to compromise that divides them.\n\nGOP critics argue that the ideological rigidity of the right wing \u2013 both its politicians and its backers \u2013 has had a destructive effect on US government. Punching far above its weight, the tea party movement and those sympathetic to it have taken the country to the financial brink several times, triggering a partial government shutdown in 2013. This year, they ousted Mr. Boehner.\n\nPerhaps recognizing this, national support for the tea party movement has dropped to its lowest point ever, according to Gallup. Last month, 17 percent of adults said they favor the movement, compared with 32 percent at the peak five years ago.\n\nIndeed, two GOP candidates are challenging Huelskamp, campaigning against his obstructionist tactics. The congressman faced no such competition in 2012. Two years later, appalled that Huelskamp was again running unopposed in the primary, a political novice jumped in \u2013 and took 45 percent of the vote on a shoestring budget.\n\n\u201cA lot of people are expecting a backlash to the tea party,\u201d says David Wasserman, who tracks House races for the independent Cook Political Report. But, he says, \u201cI don\u2019t see it coming yet.\u201d\n\nThis movement is not the backing-down type. Here in the crossroads towns of rural Kansas, Huelskamp supporters are just as mad as they were five years ago \u2013 perhaps more so because, in their view, nothing has changed.\n\nWashington isn\u2019t heeding their cry for fiscal reform. The president, they say, is getting away with executive-order overreach. They rebel against federal regulation \u2013 whether it be \u201cObamacare,\u201d new rules about water oversight, or protection for the lesser prairie chicken.\n\nIf anything, \u201cHuelskamp needs to raise his voice a little louder,\u201d says Marla Landis of Abilene, Kan., who drives a school bus. Her biggest worry is that she\u2019ll leave her grandchildren to a country that\u2019s no longer America \u2013 its Judeo-Christian values unrecognizable, its balance sheet stained red.\n\nIf it takes another government shutdown to wake people up, she says, so be it: \u201cI think that\u2019s the only way anyone is going to pay any attention.\u201d\n\nFour tea party friends\n\nChuck Henderson has ambled over to the restaurant table at Nelson\u2019s Landing in Leonardville where three of his tea party friends are talking to a reporter. He\u2019s a member of the Flint Hills Tea Party, his red athletic jacket sporting the group\u2019s emblem.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that we can\u2019t do math,\u201d he jumps in, answering a question about the futility of trying to pass conservative legislation when Democrats have blocking power in the Senate.\n\nDespite the GOP takeover of the Senate in last year\u2019s midterms, Republicans still don\u2019t have the 60 votes needed to overcome a Democratic filibuster. And it takes two thirds of both chambers to override a presidential veto.\n\nMr. Henderson understands all that. What galls him and others at the table is that it looks as if Republicans aren\u2019t even trying to fight for what they believe in. Last year, they \u201cfolded like cheap tents\u201d on budget and immigration issues, he says.\n\nRepublicans in Congress have \u201ca mountain to climb. We get that. But we won\u2019t get there if we don\u2019t take the first step,\u201d says Henderson, who lives in Manhattan, Kan., home to Kansas State University.\n\nIllegal immigration is Henderson\u2019s top issue. The mechanical engineer grew up in southern California and got to Kansas \u201cjust as quick as I could.\u201d Americans lost jobs to undocumented workers in California, and that has since spread in \u201corders of magnitude\u201d across the country, he says. Add criminality on top of that, and sanctuary cities to that, he says.\n\nIt\u2019s an issue that affects schools and health care. \u201cIts tentacles are everywhere, and our politicians are just dithering,\u201d Henderson says.\n\nEach person in the small group has a concern that they lay at the feet of President Obama \u2013 abuse of the Constitution, education mandates, and a \u201chandout\u201d society and Obamacare.\n\nBut they are just as angry with establishment Republicans, among them Boehner and Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky. These Republicans campaigned on false promises, the group says. They promised to repeal Obamacare, roll back environmental regulations, and stop \u201cexecutive amnesty\u201d for immigrants if voters would only hand them the Senate in addition to the House.\n\n\u201cWhat it boils down to is they lied to us,\u201d says Sylda Nichols, a retiree from outside Leonardville. The Senate is no different under Senator McConnell than it was under Democrat Harry Reid of Nevada, she says.\n\nLarry Tawney, Chris\u2019s husband, agrees. \u201cI think we\u2019ve had our fill of their empty promises, and I think the presidential election will reflect that.\u201d\n\nThis little group has no interest in presidential candidates like Jeb Bush or Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, the latter of whom Henderson says fell for amnesty. They like the outsiders \u2013 Ben Carson, Donald Trump, and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz (yes, they consider him an outsider).\n\nThe friends talk among themselves about being up on the issues. Indeed, they\u2019re in regular e-mail contact with Huelskamp\u2019s office, which usually sends a quick reply. They\u2019re concerned about the political apathy of other Americans. \u201cPeople need to wake up,\u201d Mr. Tawney says.\n\nMs. Nichols chimes in. \u201cBut every time we try to talk to people, they say, \u2018You\u2019re those radicals!\u2019 \u201d\n\nA driving tour of Marysville\n\nHuelskamp is sitting in the passenger seat of a black Lincoln Navigator SUV. The driver is Don Landoll, founder and president of Landoll Corp., which manufactures farm and transport equipment in Marysville, Kan., a town of about 3,300 not far from the Nebraska state line.\n\nMarysville has long been a hub for the Union Pacific Railroad \u2013 and for more than 50 years it\u2019s been home to Mr. Landoll\u2019s company, which employs 850 people.\n\nLandoll wants to give the congressman a driving tour before heading to his state-of-the-art factory. As he starts out, he passes the new hospital. It couldn\u2019t have been built without federal dollars, he says. The congressman asks him about the kind of care available there.\n\nFarther along the tour, they pass the expanded municipal airport. \u201cA lot of federal help has gone into that airport over the last 10 years,\u201d Landoll comments. Huelskamp wants to know where the doctors who work at the hospital fly in from and where patients are flown to.\n\nAs they head toward his factory, Landoll mentions that an expressway over multiple railroad tracks required big government dollars and that the airport access road is thanks to a federal grant that employed 30 people. \u201cI don\u2019t know that there\u2019s that kind of money hanging around now,\u201d he says.\n\nA little later, the congressman has an opportunity to learn just how much Landoll and his company have poured back into the community. They\u2019ve contributed serious money to the hospital, airport, and more.\n\nLandoll\u2019s passenger may be famous for his rigid stand for small government and belt-tightening in Washington. But the reality is that rural Kansas depends heavily on the federal government.\n\nIf there is a backlash against Huelskamp, it is likely to come from the business community, which is often agriculture-oriented, says Burdett Loomis, a political science professor at the University of Kansas in Lawrence.\n\n\u201cThese people are pretty sophisticated,\u201d Professor Loomis says. \u201cThey have to deal with farm subsidies. They make big investments in farm equipment. If you are surviving as a business in western Kansas, you\u2019ve got to have something on the ball. The question is, how far does this [no-compromise stance in Washington] go before they say, \u2018We can\u2019t do this anymore\u2019? \u201d\n\nThe Kansas Farm Bureau did not endorse Huelskamp \u2013 a farmer \u2013 in 2014. It didn\u2019t like his opposition to several key issues, including the farm bill; renewable fuel standards for biofuels, including corn-based ethanol; and funding for transport improvements on major waterways.\n\nThe day before his tour of Marysville, Huelskamp was about 90 miles south, visiting Abilene Machine, a family-owned business just off of Interstate 70.\n\nThe company sells new and used tractor parts. As the congressman took a tour through graveyards of expired yellow, green, and red tractors and combines, he reminisced about driving a John Deere 6600 combine on his family\u2019s farm.\n\nPart owner Kenny Roelofsen explained the business and its challenges. But he didn\u2019t say what he later told a reporter: that he wished Huelskamp were more open to compromise.\n\n\u201cI believe in a lot of what he says, I really do,\u201d says Mr. Roelofsen, a young Republican who that night would moderate a panel discussion on the future of the GOP. \u201cBut I think it would be very beneficial to the Republican Party to compromise a little bit. Compromise is the art of politics.\u201d\n\nA 2016 primary race under way\n\nTwo Republicans are saying \u201cenough already\u201d to hardball tactics. The one who jumped into the primary in 2014, Alan LaPolice, is running again. Mr. LaPolice is a student-retention specialist at Cloud County Community College in Concordia. Last quarter \u2013 his first quarter of fundraising \u2013 he raised $14,500. Huelskamp, by comparison, raised $63,700, and has $700,000 in his war chest.\n\nAt a GOP event in Abilene last month, LaPolice, a combat veteran, complained that hard-liners in Congress such as Huelskamp don\u2019t represent him. \u201cAll they do is fight. They obstruct.\u201d\n\nAlso running is Roger Marshall, an OB-GYN in Great Bend who has held just about every community leadership position imaginable \u2013 from coaching the kids he delivered as babies to serving on hospital, bank, and church boards. He was also a captain in the Army Reserve.\n\nDr. Marshall outraised Huelskamp last quarter with $151,465, though he\u2019s not even close to matching the congressman in total funds. In an interview, Marshall characterizes Huelskamp as a \u201cprofessional politician\u201d who doesn\u2019t represent Kansas. \u201cHe\u2019s part of the left and right yelling at each other so much that we can\u2019t get anything done.\u201d\n\nMr. Wasserman, at the Cook Political Report, recently met Marshall. Wasserman was impressed. But that doesn\u2019t change his view that two opponents in a primary will give Huelskamp the edge.\n\nAnd so Huelskamp \u2013 for now \u2013 continues to ride a wave of anger over issues that most Republicans in his state agree on. Next year\u2019s primary will help answer the bigger question over tactics.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.content.id": "57ad1b34b327379c9703834d886de23a", "sailthru.author": "Francine Kiefer", "description": "\u2018The Big First\u2019 district in Kansas is among the 20 most Republican districts in America, and voters there agree on conservative policies.
