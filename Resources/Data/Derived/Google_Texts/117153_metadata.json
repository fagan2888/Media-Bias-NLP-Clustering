He was referring to a provision in the law that seems to say that subsidies are available only to people living where the insurance marketplaces, known as exchanges, had been \u201cestablished by the state.\u201d\n\nMr. Carvin faced a barrage of questions from the court\u2019s liberal wing focusing on the health care law as a whole.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t look at four words,\u201d Justice Elena Kagan said. \u201cWe look at the whole text, the particular context, the more general context, try to make everything harmonious with everything else.\u201d\n\nJustice Stephen G. Breyer echoed the point.\n\n\u201cIf you want to go into the context,\u201d he told Mr. Carvin, \u201cat that point it seems to me your argument really is weaker.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nJustice Sonia Sotomayor said Mr. Carvin\u2019s reading of the law would have devastating consequences. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have the death spiral that this system was enacted to avoid,\u201d she said.\n\nThose kinds of observations from those justices were unsurprising. Justice Kennedy\u2019s comments were another matter.\n\nHe repeatedly asked whether Congress had the constitutional authority to make states choose between setting up their own insurance exchanges and letting their citizens lose tax subsidies to help them buy insurance.\n\n\u201cYour argument raises a serious constitutional question,\u201d he told Mr. Carvin.\n\nJustice Kagan made a similar point, saying that a properly drafted law would have made the choice more stark. \u201cThat\u2019s not the clarity with which we require the government to speak when it\u2019s upsetting federal-state relations like this,\u201d she said.\n\nMr. Carvin\u2019s style is brash and impatient, and some of the justices tried to slow him down. \u201cTake a breath,\u201d Justice Sotomayor told him at one point.\n\nJustice Kagan tested Mr. Carvin\u2019s reading of the law with a hypothetical question involving three of her law clerks. Suppose, she said, that she asked Will to write a memorandum and asked Elizabeth to edit it. \u201cAnd then I say,\u201d she said, \u201c \u2018Amanda, listen, if Will is too busy to write the memo, I want you to write such memo.\u2019 \u201c\n\n\u201cNow, my question is: If Will is too busy to write the memo and Amanda has to write such memo, should Elizabeth edit the memo?\u201d Justice Kagan asked.\n\nHer question tracked the structure of the health care law, which requires the federal government to step in when states decline to establish their own exchanges.\n\nMr. Carvin gave a vague answer, and Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. provided a different one.\n\n\u201c \u2018This is a great memo, who wrote it?\u2019 \u201d he imagined asking the clerks. \u201cWould the answer be, \u2018It was written by Will, because Amanda stepped into Will\u2019s shoes?\u2019 \u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nJustice Kagan seemed impressed. \u201cHe\u2019s good, Justice Alito,\u201d she said.\n\nShe reminded Mr. Carvin that he had a different position on the subsidies in the 2012 case.\n\n\u201cYou said the insurance exchanges cannot operate as intended by Congress absent the subsidies,\u201d she said.\n\nChief Justice Roberts suggested a reason for Mr. Carvin\u2019s shift in position.\n\n\u201cMr. Carvin, we\u2019ve heard talk about this other case,\u201d the chief justice said. \u201cDid you win that other case?\u201d When the laughter died down, Chief Justice Roberts added, \u201cSo maybe it makes sense that you have a different story today?\u201d\n\nFour plaintiffs, all from Virginia, sued the administration, saying they did not want to be forced to buy insurance. The subsidies, they said, made them subject to the law\u2019s requirement that they buy insurance or pay a penalty. If not for the subsidies, they said, they would have been eligible for a hardship exemption from the penalty.\n\nBoth lawyers discussed whether the plaintiffs had suffered the sort of direct injury that gave them standing to sue. But the court did not seem likely to dismiss the case on standing grounds.\n\nMr. Verrilli gave a forceful argument that had none of the halting quality of parts of his 2012 appearance before the court. He said the challengers\u2019 interpretation \u201cproduces an incoherent statute that doesn\u2019t work\u201d and \u201crevokes the promise of affordable care for millions of Americans.\u201d\n\nVideo\n\n\u201cThat cannot be the statute that Congress intended,\u201d he said.\n\nBut Mr. Verrilli had to walk a fine line in response to Justice Kennedy\u2019s concerns that the law may violate the Constitution.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not prepared to say to the court today that it is unconstitutional,\u201d Mr. Verrilli said. \u201cIt would be my duty to defend the statute.\u201d\n\nBut Mr. Verrilli added that the doctrine of constitutional avoidance, which requires courts to try to interpret laws to avoid constitutional problems, supported the administration\u2019s reading of the law.\n\nBut for that doctrine, Justice Kennedy seemed inclined to reject the administration\u2019s position. \u201cThat seems to me to go in the wrong direction for your case, not the right direction,\u201d he said on hearing Mr. Verrilli\u2019s interpretation of the law.\n\nJustices Alito and Antonin Scalia were consistently critical of the administration\u2019s position. Justice Clarence Thomas asked no questions but was in dissent in the 2012 case.\n\nJustice Scalia said the law \u201cmeans what it says\u201d even if that has \u201cdisastrous consequences.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow can the federal government establish a state exchange?\u201d he asked. \u201cThat is gobbledygook.\u201d\n\nHe added that Congress could promptly address a ruling rejecting the subsidies. \u201cYou really think Congress is just going to sit there while all of these disastrous consequences ensue?\u201d he asked.\n\nMr. Verrilli sounded skeptical. \u201cTheoretically they could,\u201d he said.\n\nJustice Alito said states could act, too.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not too late for a state to establish an exchange if we were to adopt petitioners\u2019 interpretation of the statute,\u201d he said. \u201cSo going forward, there would be no harm.\u201d Justice Alito added that the Supreme Court could defer the effective date of its decision.\n\nMr. Verrilli responded that it was \u201ccompletely unrealistic\u201d for states to be able to move fast enough even with additional time.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20150304101805, "twitter": {"description": "Oral arguments in the Supreme Court case on the Affordable Care Act included surprising comments from Justice Anthony M.
