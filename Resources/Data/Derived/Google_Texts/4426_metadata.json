Bowe Bergdahl, Entertainment News\n\nAfter a critically pilloried third season, Showtime\u2019s \u201cHomeland\u201d needed a little juice heading into Emmy season. And now CNN is providing plenty in the form of its coverage of Bowe Bergdahl, the American prisoner-of-war who was recently freed in a prisoner swap with the Taliban. With a straight face, the network keeps comparing Bergdahl to fictional POW Nicholas Brody of \u201cHomeland.\u201d\n\nFor anyone who watched the video of a shaky, ashen Bergdahl being released to American forces, the visual parallels to \u201cHomeland\u201d were certainly hard to miss. But for hard-news CNN to repeatedly compare this real-world news story \u2014 one that allegedly led to the deaths of six soldiers looking for Bergdahl, and spurred an angry and vituperative political debate \u2014 to a TV show has been bizarre, to say the least. CNN\u2019s Don Lemon invited \u201cHomeland\u201d executive producer Gideon Raff, who also created the Israeli drama on which \u201cHomeland\u201d is based, to discuss the similarities between real life and TV drama. It was the latest tone-deaf misstep in what, for Lemon, has become a career full of them \u2014 and an example of just how surreal CNN\u2019s news coverage has become.\n\n\u201cWere you surprised at the parallels between [\u2018Homeland\u201ds source material, the Israeli show \u2018Prisoners of War\u2019] and Bergdahl\u2019s release?\u201d Lemon asked. Raff said that he wasn\u2019t, because of all the research he\u2019d done on prisoners throughout his television career. Mainly, Raff said, his research taught him that prisoners\u2019 \u201cphysical and mental condition\u201d is \u201cnot so good.\u201d\n\nTo say that the Bergdahl case is reminiscent of \u201cHomeland\u201d is the opposite of useful; \u201cHomeland\u201d is a fictional television series about a POW returned to the U.S. after years in captivity and widely regarded as a menace to his country, while Bergdahl is a real human being embroiled in an ongoing diplomatic mess. And the fact that Nicholas Brody, as we learn when he attempts to blow up the vice president, turned to become an anti-American terrorist while in captivity lends Bergdahl comparisons a dangerous tinge of accusation without outright accusing \u2014 as happened in a segment on MSNBC\u2019s \u201cThe Cycle\u201d in which host Krystal Ball recapped the entire first season of \u201cHomeland,\u201d casually adding that of course Bergdahl wasn\u2019t a confirmed terrorist.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The network has also insisted that MH370 is like \"Lost\" and DC politics is like \"Scandal.\" Enough!", "author": "Daniel D'Addario", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The network has also insisted that MH370 is like \"Lost\" and DC politics is like \"Scandal.\" Enough!", "title": "CNN, stop comparing Bowe Bergdahl to Nicholas Brody", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/06/07/cnn_stop_comparing_bowe_bergdahl_to_nicholas_brody/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/06/bergdahl_brody.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The network has also insisted that MH370 is like \"Lost\" and DC politics is like \"Scandal.\" Enough!", "creator": "@dpd_", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/06/bergdahl_brody.jpg", "title": "CNN, stop comparing Bowe Bergdahl to Nicholas Brody", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "CNN, stop comparing Bowe Bergdahl to Nicholas Brody", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Bowe Bergdahl, don lemon, Editor's Picks, Homeland, Lost, malaysia airlines, Sgt.
