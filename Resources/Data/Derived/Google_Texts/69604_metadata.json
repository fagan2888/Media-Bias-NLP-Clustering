Also, it suggested harsh interrogation techniques such as waterboarding produced valuable intel \u2014 which is sort of, well, not true. And it appears to have exaggerated\u2014just a little bit, mind you\u2014the importance of certain detainees. Abu Zubaida, for instance, turns out not to have been a senior al-Qaida leader, as was claimed while he was being repeatedly waterboarded. The U.S. government now concedes he was never even an al-Qaida member. Oopsies.\n\nOf course, the investigation of events that occurred during the administration of Republican president George W. Bush was conducted by Senate Democrats. This could mean either that it was a rigorously honest inquiry unhindered by partisan loyalties\u2014or that it also exaggerates and misrepresents, to paint the opposing team in the worst possible light. Nevertheless, Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein found its contents \"shocking\"\u2014a sentiment shared by good Democrats everywhere.\n\nDemocrats have exhibited much less skepticism\u2014let alone consternation\u2014about the current administration's claims regarding the number of people who have signed up for health insurance. The White House says Obamacare hit its target of 7 million people. So far as Democratic cheerleaders are concerned, that's a slam-dunk refutation of all the naysaying from conservative Republicans. As The New York Times\u2019 Paul Krugman put it, Democrats should \"feel free to ridicule right-wingers\" who predicted otherwise.\n\nYet as Shikha Dalmia pointed out Friday at Reason.com, the 7 million figure looks awfully sketchy. Roughly 20 percent of those who sign up through the ACA\u2019s exchanges drop out without paying. And \"out of the remaining 5.6 million, only about half were likely previously uninsured.\"\n\nLikewise, many of those who signed up for Medicaid represent the normal churn in that program, which has seen hefty growth for years even without the ACA. And then there are all the Americans who have lost coverage as a result of Obamacare. In Maryland, for example, 60,000 people gained coverage through the ACA\u2014while 75,000 lost it. Oopsies.\n\nThis isn't a one-off. Obama earned PolitiFact's \"Lie of the Year\" award for repeatedly promising you could keep you insurance if you liked it.\n\nFact-checkers also slapped his hand for claiming pre-kindergarten brings a 700 percent return on its investment. And again recently for claiming Obamacare opponents have spent \"billions\" opposing the law (they haven't).\n\nThe administration has inflated the number of unlawful immigrants it deports by counting some \"returns\"\u2014people turned back at the border\u2014as deportations. And then there was James Clapper's now-infamous lie to Congress. Asked if the NSA were collecting \"any type of data at all\" on millions of Americans, Obama's director of National Intelligence responded, \"No, sir.\"\n\nNot all lies are quite so baldfaced. Recently Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe \"announced\" 40 new jobs in Nottoway County, and said the state \"is partnering\" with the Trout River kiln company to build nine new lumber kilns.\n\nVirginia's end of the \"partnership\" consists of a one-time grant of $100,000, but you're left with the impression that the jobs wouldn't have been created if not for the governor's personal intercession.\n\nMcAuliffe's predecessor, Republican Bob McDonnell, also tried\u2014time after time\u2014to hog the glory from new business ventures he had little or nothing to do with. So did his predecessor, Tim Kaine. It\u2019s S.O.P. But notice how they never \"announce\" layoffs.\n\nThese days McAuliffe asserts that failing to expand Medicaid means other states will get Virginia's share of federal funding for expansion. They won\u2019t: Total appropriations depend on the number of enrollees, so if Virginia enrolls no one, Virginia's share of the money will not be allocated elsewhere\u2014it will not be allocated, period.\n\nMcAuliffe professes total ignorance of an email setting price points for access to him and the Executive Mansion\u2014just as New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie professes total ignorance of the manipulations that led to Bridgegate. Just as Bill Clinton professed not to have had sexual relations with that woman, Ms. Lewinsky.\n\nBack during the Vietnam War, the Pentagon's PR guy, Arthur Sylvester, told a group of reporters: \"Look, if you think any American official is going to tell you the truth, then you're stupid. Did you hear that? Stupid.\" Sylvester was being too harsh. Americans are pretty sharp when it comes to picking up on lies told by the other side. If they believe the lies told by their own side, it\u2019s not because they\u2019re imbeciles. It\u2019s because they want to.\n\nThis article originally appeared in the Richmond Times-Dispatch.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://reason.com/archives/2014/04/09/bush-lied-so-did-obama", "site_name": "Reason.com", "type": "article", "description": "Dishonesty is the order of the day at the White House.", "title": "Bush Lied.
