Buy-to-let investors have had a bumper year according to data published this week. Landlords are making a 12.7pc total return in a year , taking rental income and a property’s capital gain into account.

This year, landlords have seen a gross average return of £8,233 in rent and £13,066 in capital gain, according to the buy-to-let index from LSL Property Services, which owns chains Your Move and Reeds Rains.

However, this is before taking tax, mortgage repayments and maintenance costs into account. In other words, landlords could see their income falling short of mortgage costs – particularly if rates rise in the future.

But there’s a lifeline for new landlords. This week a flurry of new mortgage deals from high lenders have cut the interest rates paid by buy-to-let borrowers, thanks to market expectations that a rate rise is some way off (see tables, below).

The biggest rate cut came from Leeds Building Society which trimmed its two-year fixed from 3.49pc to 3.09pc for borrowers with a 40pc deposit. Virgin Money, Accord and Santander followed suit this week with cuts to their fixed mortgage rates by around 0.1pc. Buyers should be aware that Accord's deal is part of a sale that ends by October.

Longer-term fixes are attractive to landlords wanting security as variable rates look set to rise. Skipton Building Society is offering a seven-year fix – the longest on the market. Those with 40pc equity or deposits can borrow at 4.6pc until 2021. The fee, comparatively low for landlord loans, is £750. For those with less to put down - 25pc - the rate rises to 5pc and the fee to £1,750.

Many of Britain’s 1.4 million private landlords have feared shrinking returns, as market predictions of a Base Rate rise loomed. Those most at risk include landlords who are new borrowers, lured by record-low interest rates.

The trend to fix is a growing one, which Telegraph Money has reported on. Britain's mortgage market is looking increasingly like those in France and elsewhere, where longer-term fixed rates are widely available if not the norm.

Buy-to-let: the charges explained

Buy-to-let mortgages often come with a higher price tag, as arrangement fees and the interest rate outstrip owner-occupier mortgage costs. For example, the £1,995 arrangement fee for a fixed buy-to-let mortgage at Virgin Money does not apply to residential customers.

David Hollingworth, from mortgage broker London & Country Mortgages, said high fees often come with the payoff of lower rates. "It's more common to get bigger fees in buy-to-let but landlords will be more willing pay up in order to drive down their interest rate," he said.

For example, a buy-to-let borrower with a 40pc deposit can pay £500 extra to arrange a Santander mortgage, in exchange for a rate that is 0.34pc lower, with the bank's two-year fixed mortgage.

Also, landlords are helped by a less stringent lending rules. Because buy-to-let mortgage applications are unregulated, loans for landlords are generally easier to secure than those for dwellers. "They are not subject to the same kind of affordability checks for ordinary buyers," Mr Hollingworth said.

"Lenders are also able to look at the property's rental income, as well as the borrower's salary, when making a decision about a buy-to-let mortgage."

Mr Hollingworth said: "Landlords are still in a healthy position, as the recent rate cuts show that the market is fiercely competitive. As a result, they benefit from rate cuts."
