And the starters soon will be bolstered.\n\nChad Bettis, out since July 18 with right elbow inflammation, likely will pitch for the Rockies as soon as Tuesday. He returned to Coors Field on Saturday from a minor-league rehab assignment.\n\n\u201cOn the cusp of possibly coming back, it puts my mind at ease to know that there are no issues anymore,\u201d Bettis said. \u201cI feel strong and healthy enough to go.\u201d\n\nThe Rockies will start David Hale in Sunday\u2019s series finale against the Mets, followed by Jorge De La Rosa. Bettis\u2019 arrival may push back Jon Gray\u2019s next start. Yohan Flande is penciled in to pitch Wednesday, which would have been Gray\u2019s day on normal rest.\n\nGray has been on a tight pitch count and innings limit since his debut this month. But the Rockies are not ready to shut him down, manager Walt Weiss said.\n\nSo the Rockies may soon move to a six-man rotation.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s possible,\u201d Weiss said. \u201cCertainly for the month of September, we\u2019ve discussed that. When all the pieces get healthy, we\u2019ll have to unscramble that. But that\u2019s one of the scenarios.\u201d\n\nThe starting rotation had allowed three runs or fewer in 11 of the Rockies\u2019 past 16 games entering Saturday. And they had a 3.45 ERA over 10 games Aug. 10-20.\n\nFor a rotation that has struggled all season, the recent run shows some potential.\n\n\u201cWe have to believe that as a starting rotation,\u201d Bettis said. \u201cWe have to figure out how we all work best together moving forward, because we can\u2019t go backward, especially now.\u201d\n\nGuidance for Gray. Bettis said he talked to Gray late Friday night, after the rookie right-hander allowed seven runs in just over an inning against the Mets. It was only Gray\u2019s fourth big-league start.\n\n\u201cI said, \u2018Hey, look, you\u2019re better than this. You know it and everybody else knows it. Don\u2019t read too much into it,\u2019 \u201d Bettis said. \u201cI told him he can be as mad as he wanted to be, but once he stepped out the door, to hit the reset button.\u201d\n\nIn Bettis\u2019 fourth start in the majors, in 2013, he gave up seven hits and eight runs (two earned) in just over two innings against the Orioles.\n\nIt comes with the process of learning to pitch, Bettis said.\n\n\u201cIt was something I had to learn. It\u2019s part of the maturity of pitching,\u201d Bettis said. \u201cIf you start trying to do too much, you dig yourself a hole. The less you think about it, the better you\u2019ll be.\u201d\n\nFootnotes. Kyle Kendrick (right shoulder inflammation) will pitch a simulated game this week as part of his rehab. There is no plan to move Kendrick to the bullpen upon his return, Weiss said. \u2026 The Mets traded for speedy outfielder Eric Young Jr. on Saturday, sending cash to the Braves in return. The former Rockies player is the son of Rockies first-base coach Eric Young, and he will report to Triple-A\n\nMets\u2019 Logan Verrett (0-1, 2.82 ERA) at Rockies\u2019 David Hale (3-4, 6.17), 2:10 p.m. Sunday, ROOT; 850 AM\n\nHale returned last week from a five-week stint on the disabled list with a groin injury. He gave up six runs on eight hits in five innings of a 15-6 blowout loss to the Nationals. Hale\u2019s role still seems unsettled. After the Rockies traded for him from Atlanta, Hale was angling for a starting job out of spring training. But a strained oblique set him back, and he began the season in Triple-A. He has pitched in just 10 games, including nine starts. He could use a healthy run through September as a tryout for next season.\n\nMonday: Rockies\u2019 Jorge De La Rosa (7-5, 4.50 ERA) at Braves\u2019 Julio Teheran (8-6, 4.32), 5:10 p.m., ROOT\n\nTuesday: Rockies\u2019 Chad Bettis (5-4, 4.88) at Braves\u2019 Mike Foltynewicz (4-5, 6.06), 5:10 p.m., ROOT\n\nWednesday: Rockies\u2019 Yohan Flande (3-1, 3.94) at Braves\u2019 Shelby Miller (5-10, 2.50), 5:10 p.m., ROOT", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Chad Bettis near return; Rockies may use six-man rotation soon", "title": "Chad Bettis near return; Rockies may use six-man rotation soon", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/08/22/chad-bettis-near-return-rockies-may-use-six-man-rotation-soon/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150701__chad-bettisp1.jpg", "height": 439}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150701__chad-bettisp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-08-22T18:18:08+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-22T04:34:33+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "\u201cWe have to believe that as a starting rotation,\u201d Bettis said.\nChad Bettis, out since July 18 with right elbow inflammation, likely will pitch for the Rockies as soon as Tuesday.\nIt comes with the process of learning to pitch, Bettis said.\nBut that\u2019s one of the scenarios.\u201dThe starting rotation had allowed three runs or fewer in 11 of the Rockies\u2019 past 16 games entering Saturday.\nSo the Rockies may soon move to a six-man rotation."}
