New mathematical evidence shows one's early forties to be the unhappiest time of life.\n\nAnyone who\u2019s read The Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy knows the secret to life as \"42.\" But that number also represents the unhappiest age of life, scientists say.\n\nAs longevity rises around the globe, interest continues to build in the study of human happiness, a concept past generations might have found risible. After all, the human animal is built to run on a mostly empty stomach, chasing forever something in the distance. Continuous suffering defines the condition of his life. And the onset of midlife in one's early forties represents the opotheosis of this suffering.\n\nYet some scientists say they\u2019d like to do something about that. In analyzing a boatload of longitudinal data, Terence C. Cheng says they took a new mathematical view of the traditional view of happiness through the human lifespan. \u201cThere is a large amount of cross-sectional evidence for a midlife low in the life cycle of human happiness and well-being [illustrated as a U-shape],\u201d the researchers wrote. \u201cYet no genuinely longitudinal inquiry has uncovered evidence for a U-shaped pattern.\u201d\n\nThus, Cheng and his colleagues revisited the conundrum by posing a new test. \u201cDrawing on four data sets, and only within-person changes in well-being, we document powerful support for a U-shape in unadjusted longitudinal data without the need for regression equations,\u201d he said. \u201cThe paper\u2019s methodological contribution is to exploit the first-derivative properties of a well-being equation.\u201d\n\nAmong the four populations studied were three nationally representative groups in the United Kingdom, Germany, and Australia, in addition to a smaller sampling of medical doctors in Australia. The average age of people in the study was 40 years old, give or take a couple of years.\n\n\u201cUsing our simple first-derivative method, we have documented strong multi-country evidence for such a U shape,\u201d Cheng said. \u201cThus recent claims that the U is an artefact \u2014 one caused by influences such as omitted cohort effects \u2014 appear to be incorrect.\u201d\n\nAs it turns out, the great mid-life crisis is real, Cheng says. Most people tend to experience a profound lull in happiness in their early 40s, as they adjust to the second act of life.\n\nSource: Cheng T, Powdthavee N, Oswald A, et al.
