Measure M \u2014 more than simply a yes or no on potential development \u2013 is being portrayed as a vote on the future identity of Menlo Park.At issue is whether to retain the small-town character that some residents say is disappearing, or to follow the lead of neighboring cities such as Redwood City, which are building large-scale infrastructure to attract tech jobs and tax revenue.Measure M would limit the amount of future office space allowed downtown and along El Camino Real to no more than 100,000 square feet per project, and would require citywide elections to exceed this cap. If approved by voters, Measure M would delay or halt two large development projects under review by the city.Stanford University and Greenheart Land Company are proposing to build up to 409,500 square feet of offices \u2014 the size of seven football fields \u2014 in addition to 390 apartments and retail space. Both developers said that if Measure M passes, they would scrap their projects and begin anew or not continue at all.The group behind the initiative, Save Menlo, raised over $48,300 in small donations from dozens of residents, many of them retired. They say passing the measure would prevent an increase in peak-hour traffic and steer the city towards other types of developments desired by the community, such as hotels, cafes and open-air plazas. The city council and other opponents say Measure M would upend a multi-year planning process by the local government to end blight and revitalize the area, and it would deprive the city of millions in revenue.\n\nA group battling Measure M, Menlo Park Deserves Better, raised over $7,500. Greenheart Land Company, which says it could face a two-year delay on its project and lose millions of dollars if Measure M passes, donated $200,000 to the Committee for a Vibrant Downtown, which is fighting the measure through fliers, phone banking and signs.\n\nThe Stanford and Greenheart projects would generate an estimated $3.7 million in annual revenue for the city, county, schools and other local agencies, according to consultants hired by Greenheart. A study commissioned by the city on Measure M concluded the initiative would have a chilling effect on future developments and create a competitive disadvantage for Menlo Park as neighboring cities don\u2019t require voter approval to raise development limits.\n\nThis hasn\u2019t deterred Measure M supporters like JoAnne Goldberg, who is alarmed by the size of the proposed office buildings.\u201cThis is a very desirable place. This is not upper Siberia!\u201d said Goldberg, a long-time resident. \u201cPeople want to be here, and they want to develop here. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s unrealistic to try to balance expectations so that developers can make a profit but there\u2019s also something in it for the residents.\u201dGoldberg said everyone agrees the large vacant lots along El Camino need to be developed, but not with \u201cgargantuan office parks.\u201d\u201cRight now, the projects that we are looking at are so huge it\u2019s going to be a ton more traffic,\u201d Goldberg said. \u201cWe are just trying to keep our lives from slipping further and further. And it\u2019s getting worse every year.\u201d\n\nMarc Hayden takes an opposing view to his neighbor, Goldberg. He said Menlo Park voters shouldn\u2019t be forced to vote on complex zoning issues they don\u2019t have the time to fully understand. Hayden said he trusts the city council\u2019s negotiations with developers and would resent the delay that Measure M would impose on projects to develop the vacant lots on El Camino.\n\n\u201cNothing is going to happen if we go down this road,\u201d said Hayden, who works in real estate, and believes most residents want a city where they can live and work. \u201cWe absolutely should be able to control our destiny and I think we\u2019ve done so. I just don\u2019t buy it that big money is trying to get us. I want to live with my children in a place where we can be progressive.\u201dHayden and Goldberg participated in some of the 90 public meetings that the city held as part of its $1.7 million planning process to revitalize the area, with a final plan approved in 2012. Menlo Park\u2019s median house price is $1.5 million, but closed storefronts haunt the posh boutiques and restaurants downtown on Santa Cruz Avenue. The Stanford and Greenheart project sites are just blocks away from those struggling businesses, and city council member Peter Ohtaki believes that proximity would help bring new customers.\u201cThe proposals have a 50-50 mix of office and apartments,\u201d said Ohtaki, who is running for re-election, at a recent voter forum where Measure M dominated the conversation. \u201cThat means a daytime and evening population that could become new customers for our downtown merchants.\u201dOhtaki and two more city council members running for reelection are against Measure M, while three challenger candidates support it.\n\nCandidate Kelly Fergusson regularly pushes for the initiative at the Sunday farmer\u2019s market. She said Measure M is a \u201clast resort\u201d because the current council ignored concerns by residents.\n\n\u201cOn these development sites we are building for generations, for a hundred years,\u201d said Fergusson, a former Menlo Park mayor. \u201cWe need to get a balanced mix of uses right so that it serves the residents, not just line the pockets of wealthy investors.\u201dMayor Ray Mueller said the city council is achieving concessions from developers for the community and that Measure M is unnecessary.\u201cThe question is whether or not (residents) trust us to mitigate traffic. And we are drilling down on traffic and making improvements,\u201d Mueller said in a telephone interview. The city council recently called for Stanford University to scale down their proposal \u2014 the largest under review \u2014 after a study showed it would significantly increase traffic congestion. Stanford is waiting until after the election to determine whether it will submit a new proposal.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Peninsula Press", "description": "Measure M is being portrayed as a vote on the future identity of Menlo Park -- all happening in one of the hottest real estate markets in the country.", "title": "Election battle divides Menlo Park over how much to grow - Peninsula Press", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://peninsulapress.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Karen-Lines-and-Victor-Valdez-compete.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-01-12T10:30:23+00:00", "url": "http://peninsulapress.com/2014/10/21/measure-m-menlo-park/", "type": "article"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/PeninsuPress", "section": "Politics", "tag": "real estate", "published_time": "2014-10-21T07:20:36+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-01-12T10:30:23+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "Measure M is being portrayed as a vote on the future identity of Menlo Park -- all happening in one of the hottest real estate markets in the country.", "creator": "@PeninsuPress", "image": "http://peninsulapress.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Karen-Lines-and-Victor-Valdez-compete.jpg", "title": "Election battle divides Menlo Park over how much to grow - Peninsula Press", "site": "@PeninsuPress", "card": "summary"}, "generator": "WordPress 4.2.4", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8dda\"", "article_summary": "A group battling Measure M, Menlo Park Deserves Better, raised over $7,500.\n\u201cOn these development sites we are building for generations, for a hundred years,\u201d said Fergusson, a former Menlo Park mayor.\nHe said Menlo Park voters shouldn\u2019t be forced to vote on complex zoning issues they don\u2019t have the time to fully understand.\nA vote on whether to limit the amount of office space that can be added to Menlo Park is pitting neighbor against neighbor and shaping up to be the most divisive issue in the upcoming city council election.\nThis hasn\u2019t deterred Measure M supporters like JoAnne Goldberg, who is alarmed by the size of the proposed office buildings.\u201cThis is a very desirable place."}
