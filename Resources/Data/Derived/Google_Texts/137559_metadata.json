(AP) - No matter how the final match goes, there will be a surprise champion at the Family Circle Cup.\n\nNo. 14 seed Andrea Petkovic of Germany and Jana Cepelova of Slovakia advance to the finals Saturday, both rallying late in their matches to set up an unlikely championship Sunday.\n\nPetkovic rallied in the final two sets to defeat sixth-seeded Eugenie Bouchard 1-6, 6-3, 7-5, while Cepelova came back from 4-1 down in a third-set tiebreaker to oust 17-year-old Swiss qualifier Belinda Bencic 6-4, 5-7, 7-6 (7).\n\nPetkovic appeared overwhelmed by the 20-year-old Canadian early on, losing seven straight games and trailing 3-2 in the second set. That\u2019s when the German took control, winning four consecutive games to force a decisive set.\n\nPetkovic was trailing 4-2 in that one before digging in a final time and breaking Bouchard\u2019s serve twice down the stretch to advance to her first championship since Washington, D.C., last August where she fell to Magdalena Rybarikova in straight sets.\n\nPetkovic broke down and cried with a towel over her head after the match, happy she was again in this position after the past three years dealing with injuries to her ankle, knee and back that caused her to miss nine months on tour.\n\n\u201cI was just so relieved and I was proud that I came back from all these injuries, and I never thought that I would play finals in the big tournaments again,\u201d said Petkovic, who hadn\u2019t gotten past the quarterfinals in her six previous tournaments this season.\n\nPetkovic, ranked 40th in the world, calmly analyzed her first-set shortcomings and understood that with a few changes, she could get back in the match.\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t that upset because I felt Genie was playing incredible tennis,\u201d she said. \u201cI just lacked that 10 percent.\u201d\n\nSo Petkovic moved a step closer to the baseline so she could hit deeper forehands and put Bouchard on her heels. Things finally clicked midway through the second set as Petkovic fought off three break points to hold serve and begin her comeback.\n\n\u201cI said, \u2018Even if I miss more, I\u2019m going to have to get the length or she\u2019s going to kill me,\u2019\u201d Petkovic said.\n\nBouchard wasn\u2019t done, taking a 4-2 lead in the final set and having a chance to break serve for a bigger lead. But Petkovic hit a pair of crisp serves to win that game and followed by breaking Bouchard\u2019s serve to tie the set at four games.\n\nPetkovic broke Bouchard\u2019s serve a final time to close out the match on four consecutive points.\n\nBouchard trailed in the third set in her two previous matches before eliminating No. 11 seed Venus Williams in the third round and No. 2 seed Jelena Jankovic in the quarterfinals. Against Petkovic, Bouchard says she didn\u2019t play as aggressively down the stretch as she had hoped.\n\n\u201cI think I just hesitated on a few balls and on my chances. That\u2019s not the way I want to play,\u201d Bouchard said. \u201cI really want to go for my shots, and when I hesitate, it doesn\u2019t end up well for me.\u201d\n\nCepelova, 20, hadn\u2019t ever been past the quarterfinals since her WTA debut in 2011. But she began a week of Family Circle surprises - just one of the top 10 seeds reached the semifinals - by defeating world No. 1 Serena Williams on Tuesday night and now will play for her first tour title.\n\nNot that her semifinal was easy. Cepelova squandered one match point while up 5-4 in the final set, then two more in the tiebreaker before Bencic sailed a shot long to end things.\n\nCepelova said she carried the confidence she got from beating Williams into the rest of the week. \u201cI think now on these matches that I won, I try to keep playing like against Serena,\u201d she said.\n\nPetkovic\u2019s father, Zoran, played college tennis at South Carolina and was among the Gamecocks top players with an 18-8 singles record in 1982. She hopes to give her family more reason to celebrate their connections to the Palmetto State.\n\nAndrea Petkovic, who\u2019s won two WTA titles at Strasbourg in 2011 and Bad Gastein in 2009, understands she\u2019ll be expected to easily defeat her untested opponent.\n\n\u201cThey are super young, so they will come out and play great tennis,\u201d she said. \u201cI am 100 percent sure of that, so I will have it very tough and I will have to fight hard.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "No matter how the final match goes, there will be a surprise champion at the Family Circle Cup.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "No matter how the final match goes, there will be a surprise champion at the Family Circle Cup.", "title": "Petkovic, Cepelova advance to Family Circle finals", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/apr/5/petkovic-rallies-past-bouchard-in-3-sets/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/04/05/fdc659bb64ec830d500f6a7067006c11.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/04/05/fdc659bb64ec830d500f6a7067006c11.jpg", "description": "No matter how the final match goes, there will be a surprise champion at the Family Circle Cup.", "card": "summary", "title": "Petkovic, Cepelova advance to Family Circle finals"}, "Author": "PETE IACOBELLI", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Sports, Andrea Petkovic, Jana \u010cepelov\u00e1, Eugenie Bouchard, Belinda Bencic"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd844f\"", "article_summary": "CHARLESTON, S.C.
