File/Brad Nettles/Staff\n\nRoper St. Francis and Boeing announced a new partnership Wednesday aimed at providing better health care for the aircraft manufacturer\u2019s Lowcountry employees and their dependents.\n\nThe new \u201cclinically integrated network\u201d will offer Boeing workers same-day or next-day primary care appointments, a nurse who can be reached by phone around-the-clock and an online portal for scheduling office visits and reviewing medical records, among other perks. Prescription drugs and appointment co-payments will also cost less.\n\nBoeing\u2019s existing health care options will remain in place.\n\n\u201cThis is the first time a health care system has partnered with a large private employer in the Lowcountry to improve and maintain the health of employees and their family members,\u201d Roper St. Francis said in a written statement.\n\nThe model isn\u2019t new, though. It\u2019s based on a design made popular by the federal Affordable Care Act called an \u201cAccountable Care Organization,\u201d or ACO for short. ACOs are intended to lower costs and improve health care quality through increased communication between providers and patients.\n\nThe results, so far, are mixed. In some markets, ACOs lowered health care spending. In others, the model didn\u2019t.\n\nIn theory, Roper St. Francis will profit financially by keeping Boeing employees well, instead of simply treating them when they show up sick in a doctor\u2019s office. In the long run, Boeing should save money by insuring a healthier workforce \u2014 especially if chronic conditions, such as diabetes and hypertension, are managed more effectively.\n\nRoper St. Francis CEO David Dunlap called this new network \u201cpatient centered\u201d and \u201cexactly the type of health care that you and I want for our families and for ourselves.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe believe that delivering coordinated care to large populations is where the health care industry is headed,\u201d Dunlap said during an event Wednesday at Boeing to announce the plan.\n\nBeverly Wyse, vice president and general manager of Boeing South Carolina, said the partnership is \u201ca new and better approach to health care and how it\u2019s delivered. It is more efficient and more effective.\u201d\n\nLast year, Boeing announced similar partnerships with health care systems in Washington state to provide better coordinated care for some 27,000 employees in the Puget Sound region.\n\nThe new partnership between the company and Roper St. Francis will officially launch on Jan. 1 and will be available to more than 6,000 Boeing workers. Although the partnership covers access to health care, Boeing\u2019s workers still will get their health insurance through Blue Cross Blue Shield of South Carolina.\n\nHospital leaders say it won\u2019t compromise access afforded to other Roper St. Francis patients in the Lowcountry.\n\n\u201cOur goal is to provide convenient and timely access to all of our patients who are seeking an appointment with a primary care physician or a specialist,\u201d Dunlap said through a hospital spokesman.\n\nFor urgent needs, any Roper St. Francis patient should be able to see a primary care provider within 24 hours or a specialist within 72 hours. Non-urgent appointments should be scheduled within 10 days, he said.\n\n\u201cWe recognize that this is setting the bar high, and that we are currently not achieving this 100 percent of the time,\u201d Dunlap said. \u201cHowever, we believe that the fact we are measuring this and reporting it to our physician offices will allow all of us to work even harder to make this the recognized standard of care for every practice.\u201d\n\nRoper spokesman Andy Lyons and Jeff White, Boeing\u2019s director of health care services, would not disclose the financial terms of the new partnership.\n\nThe health care system also staffs a 2,300-square-foot clinic at the planemaker\u2019s North Charleston campus for occupational medical needs. The new plan will not affect the on-site clinic.\n\nReach Lauren Sausser at 937-5598.
