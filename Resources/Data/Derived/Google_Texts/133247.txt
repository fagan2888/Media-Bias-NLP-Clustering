John Oliver has yet again serviced journalism under the veil of comedy by devoting 16 minutes to civil forfeiture, a practice that allows law enforcement to seize property without conviction of a crime.

Then Oliver called on America’s favorite meme Jeff Goldblum to illustrate how badly we need reform.
