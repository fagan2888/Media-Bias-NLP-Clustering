He hasn\u2019t sold-out. Earlier this year, David Augustine even found himself interviewing acclaimed neurosurgeon and aspiring United States presidential hopeful Ben Carson about everything from Stacy Dash\u2019s controversial remarks about BET to blacks earning generational wealth. If anyone would be up to that task, it would be the Louisiana State University graduate and former middle school teacher.\n\nUtilizing his signature ability to spit rhymes that split between biting socio-economic commentary and earnest comedy without crassness or profanity, HipHopDX premiered the video for \u201cSallie Mae Back\u201d this week. While most rappers celebrate buying extravagant houses, foreign sports cars and expensive clothes after earning the much sought after major label deal, the rapper just wanted to celebrate paying off his student loans. It is no wonder as to why he\u2019s become a respected figure in the culture.\n\nTaking time to speak with HipHopDX, Dee-1 discusses the need for affordable higher education, healthcare and the progress of his major label debut.\n\nDee-1 On The Responsibility Hip Hop Has In The Upcoming Presidential Elections\n\n\u201cI definitely was paying attention because I did interview Dr.[Ben] Carson. I\u2019m more engaged than ever this year because by me being in Iowa, I saw what that environment was like and people were going hard for the vote of Iowans. Politicians really wanted to start off by doing well. The way I feel this year is that it feels unpredictable because the whole time for the Republicans, we were hearing that Donald Trump is so far in the lead and he lost to Ted Cruz. Meanwhile, everybody thought Hillary Clinton was going to win and she ended up in a dead tie with Bernie Sanders. I do think that we as the Hip Hop community, we\u2019re tastemakers. We\u2019re not even just artists. Pop culture is always looking to Hip Hop to see what\u2019s cool, relevant or important. When it comes to who we\u2019re feeling as far as political candidates, we have a lot of power that we need to put into use by getting out to vote and engaging in the process.\u201d\n\nHow Affordable Higher Education Influenced \u201cSallie Mae Back\u201d\n\n\u201cFor me right now, I would say that moving forward, it\u2019s about a couple of things. Because I\u2019m so tied to anything education related being a college graduate and teacher, definitely I\u2019m interested in what someone can do to make college more affordable for people. Student loan debt is crazy and out of control. I just read a figure that students are in debt $1.2 trillion in the United States. For me, making higher education more affordable for people and try to help people when it comes to getting rid of some of this debt that they\u2019ve encountered. That\u2019s important to me moving forward. Matter of fact, it\u2019s funny because of the video I released called \u201cSallie Mae Back.\u201d It\u2019s super fire. I did it because it\u2019s not a gimmick. It\u2019s something that\u2019s a real part of my life. When I signed my record deal, I took a chunk of my money and finished paying Sallie Mae because I had been making the minimum payments every month and that wasn\u2019t getting me anywhere. I kept the same car. I still drive a 1998 Honda Accord bruh and that\u2019s my baby because I\u2019ve been through so much with that car. It just felt great to live life debt free.\u201d\n\nBeing Grateful Obama Repealed No Child Left Behind\n\n\u201cI felt like it was something that was helpful because honestly, people in the education system know it\u2019s very tough when you\u2019re trying to teach for the test. When you\u2019re trying to have these standardized test hold so much weight that messes the whole classroom experience up for the students and teachers. I think that\u2019s something that was needed honestly. That\u2019s not true learning when you\u2019re just trying to teach someone just to pass a certain test.\u201d\n\nBeing A Rapper On Obamacare\n\n\u201cThe other issue that I\u2019m concerned about is health care. The difference between me being an artist and school teacher is that health care didn\u2019t cross my mind when I was in education because you get that stuff as part of your salary. Being an artist, I basically work for myself. With that being said, the different health care packages and I know there\u2019s Obamacare. There are Republicans trying to do away with Obamacare. I\u2019m real interested in that. Literally, we don\u2019t have an employer who gives us a salary. I have to ask my lawyer or something, but to my knowledge, it\u2019s not something that labels really help with. So, you literally have artists out here thuggin it and praying that they don\u2019t get sick.\u201d\n\n\u201cCurrently, I have Obamacare which I had to do on my own and sign up for that. I\u2019m interested in seeing how the issue of health care comes up in the election because a couple of years ago, I didn\u2019t have health insurance. Maybe I wasn\u2019t educated enough to know what all the options were. I was thinking if I was sick, what doctors would I be cool with to just text real quick. I\u2019ve had issues with my health growing up honestly which is a whole other conversation. I\u2019ve definitely been hospitalized and had surgery with issues in my chest, stomach and esophagus. I had all kinds of issues.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know that those bills are real. I\u2019ve been in something simple like a car accident. I remember being in a car accident in Alabama and the hospital visit was a few thousand and I was there overnight. The ambulance ride from the scene of the accident to the hospital was like six or seven hundred dollars. I\u2019m like bruh, the hospital was like five blocks away. I cut my finger and sprained my shoulder. I would have walked to the hospital if I knew it was going to be that much or at least caught an Uber.\u201d\n\nWill The \u201cSeparated At Birth\u201d Mixtape Featuring Lil Wayne Instrumentals Ever Drop?\n\n\u201cYeah, it\u2019s going to see the light of day. It\u2019s just something where I had to make a chess move and decide. I have the music still so it\u2019s totally up to me. Nobody can stop me from putting out something I want to, but I want to make a chess move. It was a better long term move for me for me to not put it out. If the situation is right for it, then I\u2019ll put it out. The answer is, I don\u2019t know if it\u2019ll ever come out being honest.\u201d\n\nStatus Of Major Label Debut\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just time for it. I never wanted to force an album out just because of a record label timeline or being next on the list to put an album out. I feel like it\u2019s time. So many of my fans have been asking me when the album was coming. What\u2019s up with the album? What\u2019s poppin' with the album homie? That\u2019s what really made me feel that I have a narrative that I want to tell. That\u2019s the thing. I just don\u2019t want to keep making random songs and throwing them out. I have a story I want to tell in one body of work. Therefore, it\u2019s that season right now. I\u2019m in that mode right now. I realized that I am a symbol of hope for people in the hood. That\u2019s what I\u2019ve come to realize because I really come from that environment, but I really took a different path then a lot of people who come from where I come from. I really made some distinct choices in my life that took me down a different route. That\u2019s all I am. I\u2019m a symbol of hope for other people who have gone through that and are still going through that. That\u2019s who I want to make music for. I\u2019m finally embracing the fact that I need to be someone who always sets the bar higher for people who come from the hood. The bar is set so low in the hood.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe major label situation brings more pressure. With David And Goliath, I was in Baton Rouge, in college just finishing exams and just trying to find your way in the world. There are no expectations as far as sales. If this sells 300 copies, that\u2019s OK because no one else is depending on this or anything. There are more expectations on a major label album because it\u2019s more business now. Back then, it was literally a hobby for me. It wasn\u2019t my career. I think that\u2019s the main thing. What the label is going to push the album? I don\u2019t know. This is my first go-around and I\u2019ve heard horror stories from artists in my position. I have other artists friends who said the label did help out and allowed the music to reach a wider audience. I just have to record the best music that I can and turn it in.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Dee-1 explains using advance from RCA deal to pay back his student loans.", "author": "HipHopDX", "og": {"site_name": "HipHopDX", "description": "EXCLUSIVE: Rapper explains using advance from RCA deal to pay back his student loans.", "title": "Dee-1\u2019s Reality: Paying \u201cSallie Mae Back\u201d & Having Obamacare", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://s3.amazonaws.com/hiphopdx-production/2016/02/Dee-1_2_14_2016-620x620.jpg", "url": "http://hiphopdx.com/interviews/id.2852/title.dee-1s-reality-paying-sallie-mae-back-having-obamacare", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "EXCLUSIVE: Rapper explains using advance from RCA deal to pay back his student loans.", "title": "Dee-1\u2019s Reality: Paying \u201cSallie Mae Back\u201d & Having Obamacare", "image": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/hiphopdx-production/2016/02/Dee-1_2_14_2016-e1455292474108-220x165.jpg", "site": "@hiphopdx", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "index,follow,noodp", "DC.date.issued": "2016-02-12", "tweetmeme-title": "Dee-1\u2019s Reality: Paying \u201cSallie Mae Back\u201d & Having Obamacare", "fb": {"app_id": 295838568104}, "DC.creator": "HipHopDX - http://hiphopdx.com", "keywords": "Dee-1, U.S. Presidential Election, Obamacare, Hip Hop, Student Loans", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/HipHopDX"}, "DC.subject": "Dee-1 explains using advance from RCA deal to pay back his student loans.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "There are more expectations on a major label album because it\u2019s more business now.\nMatter of fact, it\u2019s funny because of the video I released called \u201cSallie Mae Back.\u201d It\u2019s super fire.\nDee-1 On The Responsibility Hip Hop Has In The Upcoming Presidential Elections\u201cI definitely was paying attention because I did interview Dr.[Ben] Carson.\nMeanwhile, everybody thought Hillary Clinton was going to win and she ended up in a dead tie with Bernie Sanders.\nI still drive a 1998 Honda Accord bruh and that\u2019s my baby because I\u2019ve been through so much with that car."}
