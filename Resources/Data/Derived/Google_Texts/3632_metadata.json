The Iowa Hospital Association has filed a lawsuit, asking a judge to intervene.\n\n\u201cPut the brakes on this,\u201d says Scott McIntyre, the vice president of communications for the Iowa Hospital Association. \u201cAllow people time to talk things out, make things work and implement a plan that works for everybody.\u201d\n\nAccording to McIntyre, the Branstad Administration still hasn\u2019t provided hospitals with the \u201crate card\u201d hospitals must use in discussions with the four private companies that will manage care for Medicaid patients.\n\n\u201cHospitals really don\u2019t have that starting point from which to negotiate a contract or from which to make financial plans,\u201d McIntyre says.\n\nState officials have given hospitals and other Iowa health care providers a January 1 deadline to sign contracts with the managed care companies. On Monday, Branstad confirmed his administration will enforce a 10 percent penalty in Medicaid reimbursement to Iowa health care providers that fail to sign managed care deals by January 1st. McIntyre says lawyers tell him the state doesn\u2019t have the authority to impose that 10 percent penalty.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t even know the base rates at this point, so we are talking about 10 percent of what?\u201d McIntyre says. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of another example of putting the cart before the horse and not being clear on what the state\u2019s plans are.\u201d\n\nAfter initially opposing the idea, Branstad in 2013 did approve expanding the number of poor Iowans who qualified for Medicaid. That has led to a reduction in so-called \u201ccharity care\u201d in Iowa hospitals, but McIntyre says hospital executives fear those gains may be lost in the switch to \u201cmanaged care\u201d for Medicaid patients.\n\n\u201cOur concern, one of many, regarding this plan is that these companies will deny care. Folks will go to the emergency room anyway, which won\u2019t be covered even if they do have insurance, and once again our charity care costs will go up and those costs impact everybody,\u201d McIntyre says. \u201cThe hospitals really don\u2019t have a choice but to pass along that impact.\u201d\n\nOn Monday Branstad accused Iowa hospitals of \u201cobjecting\u201d to the Iowa Health and Wellness Plan. That\u2019s the state\u2019s version of expanding Medicaid coverage to more Iowans, a move that was authorized under the Affordable Care Act. Critics point out Branstad initially opposed expanding Medicaid coverage to more Iowans and McIntyre says hospitals actually championed the bipartisan Health and Wellness Plan.\n\n\u201cBecause of the changes, the tweaks the governor wanted included in that, we went to bat for the state with the federal government and made sure those waivers happened,\u201d McIntyre says, \u201cso certainly it was a collaborative effort.\u201d\n\nGovernor Branstad says 25 other states have shifted Medicaid patients into managed care and have saved money in the process.\n\n(This post was updated at 12:30 p.m. after the Iowa Hospital Association notified Radio Iowa it had filed the lawsuit.)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Radio Iowa", "description": "A spokesman for the state\u2019s 118 hospitals says there\u2019s too much uncertainty about the Branstad Administration\u2019s push to switch more than half a million Medicaid patients in Iowa t\u2026", "title": "Iowa hospitals to Branstad: \u2018Put the brakes\u2019 on managed care for Medicaid patients", "url": "http://www.radioiowa.com/2015/11/10/iowa-hospitals-to-branstad-put-the-brakes-on-managed-care-for-medicaid-patients/", "image": {"secure_url": "https://i0.wp.com/cdn.radioiowa.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Iowa-Hospital-Assoc.jpg", "identifier": "http://cdn.radioiowa.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Iowa-Hospital-Assoc.jpg"}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "article": {"published_time": "2015-11-10T16:17:13+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-11-10T18:30:27+00:00"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://cdn.radioiowa.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Iowa-Hospital-Assoc.jpg?w=1400", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp,noydir", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "That has led to a reduction in so-called \u201ccharity care\u201d in Iowa hospitals, but McIntyre says hospital executives fear those gains may be lost in the switch to \u201cmanaged care\u201d for Medicaid patients.\nState officials have given hospitals and other Iowa health care providers a January 1 deadline to sign contracts with the managed care companies.\nOn Monday, Branstad confirmed his administration will enforce a 10 percent penalty in Medicaid reimbursement to Iowa health care providers that fail to sign managed care deals by January 1st.\n(This post was updated at 12:30 p.m. after the Iowa Hospital Association notified Radio Iowa it had filed the lawsuit.)\n\u201cPut the brakes on this,\u201d says Scott McIntyre, the vice president of communications for the Iowa Hospital Association."}
