They did their banking at the post office and the few dozen rooms to rent were booked out every summer with people who had heard \u2013 by word of mouth \u2013 of its spectacular empty beaches, clear seas and fresh seafood the old-fashioned way.\n\nBut because the island still runs on cash, the shuttering of banks nationwide has been utterly devastating. Residents have been forced to make nine-hour round trips to the nearest big island to get cash and Greek visitors say they can\u2019t get together enough money to come.\n\n\u201cTourist numbers are down 80% this year,\u201d said mayor Maria Kakali, in an office at the heart of the village where she grew up, home to around 200 people. \u201cEven people born here and living in Athens, who have their own places on the island, aren\u2019t coming.\u201d ...\n\nTourist favourites such as Mykonos fear that losing the tax breaks will make it hard for them to compete with Turkey, but for Agios Efstratios it poses a far more existential threat.\n\n\u201cIf we have to pay a tax of 23%, I\u2019m sorry to say it, but we will all die on the island,\u201d Kakali says in her office off the quiet main square of the island\u2019s only settlement.
