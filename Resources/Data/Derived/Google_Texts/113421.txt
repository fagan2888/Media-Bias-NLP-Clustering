Representatives at UR Medicine and Jones Memorial Hospital in Allegany County said Thursday that they're in discussions to build upon their working relationship, although a decision could be months away.

Leaders from both organizations said in a statement that an affiliation could let them improve services to the Southern Tier. Currently, UR Medicine provides specialists such as cardiologists and neurologists to Jones.

In September, UR Medicine and Noyes Health, which runs Nicholas H. Noyes Memorial Hospital in Livingston County, announced similar talks.

UR Medicine operates Strong Memorial Hospital and has affiliate agreements with Highland Hospital in Rochester and Thompson Health in Ontario County. It also has a collaborative agreement with Wyoming County Community Hospital, a 62-bed facility in Warsaw.

Jones Memorial Hospital is a 70-bed facility in Wellsville. Regulatory approvals are months away, according to the statement.

The talks between UR Medicine and Jones continue a trend of health care organizations consolidating services, which has been driven in part by the Affordable Care Act.

For instance, the Rochester Regional Health System has been working to bring Clifton Springs in Ontario County and United Memorial Medical Center in Batavia into its system. Rochester Regional was formed by the merger of the Rochester General and Unity health systems.
