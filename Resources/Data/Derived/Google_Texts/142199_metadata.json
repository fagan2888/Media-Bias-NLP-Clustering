And yet we really haven\u2019t made much progress.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nThe International Monetary Fund has come up with a much higher estimate for the global total of fossil fuel subsidies \u2014 $5.3 trillion, which includes the costs of the effects of energy use on people\u2019s health, the environment and climate change. That figure constitutes 6.9 percent of the global gross domestic product.\n\nWhatever the estimates, they stand in sharp contrast to the money being spent on reducing the effects of climate change. Even the lowest subsidy estimates far exceed the pledge by advanced industrialized nations to spend $100 billion a year by 2020 to fight climate change.\n\nA recent report from the Climate Policy Initiative, a nonprofit research and policy organization funded by the financier George Soros, suggested that to keep the global temperature from rising more than two degrees Celsius would require about $1 trillion per year.\n\nBill Hare, chief executive of the nonprofit research and policy group Climate Analytics, said taking action on direct subsidies could have a profound effect. \u201cEmissions could be reduced by up to 20 percent from what would otherwise occur if you removed fossil fuel subsidies,\u201d he added.\n\nCritics of subsidies say their greatest benefits go to the middle class and the rich, who can better afford cars.\n\nBy keeping conventional fuels at low prices, subsidies also make alternative energy sources less affordable in comparison. The International Energy Agency\u2019s 2014 World Energy Outlook report warned, \u201cFossil fuel subsidies rig the game against renewables and act as a drag on the transition to a more sustainable energy system.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThat report noted that some countries spent a greater share of their gross domestic product on fossil fuel subsidies than on health or education.\n\nGoing into the Paris climate talks, China, Ethiopia, India, Mexico, Morocco, Singapore and Vietnam had committed to addressing subsidies, Mr. Kretzmann said. \u201cGovernments have a lot of incentive and opportunity to eliminate those now, with oil prices so low,\u201d he added.\n\nPhoto\n\nAnd as prices have dropped, subsidies have been reduced in many countries, including India, Indonesia, Mexico and the United Arab Emirates, said Dr. Hare of Climate Analytics.\n\nWhile attempts to cut subsidies have led to social unrest, more recent efforts, including a gradual phaseout to soften the blow, have enjoyed quiet success.\n\nBut previous efforts have often been abandoned when global fuel prices rise and consumers are pinched. \u201cIf you look at the history of fuel subsidy reform, it doesn\u2019t always stick,\u201d said Michael L. Ross, a professor of political science at the University of California, Los Angeles, who studies energy subsidies.\n\nA study from the Carbon Tracker Initiative, the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis and other groups suggested that eliminating production subsidies for the Powder River Basin coal region in Wyoming and Montana alone would raise the price of that coal enough to reduce demand for it by 30 percent in the long term, which the study estimates would equal the emissions from as many as 32 coal-burning plants.\n\nMore Reporting on Climate Change\n\nMichael A. Levi, an energy expert with the Council on Foreign Relations, said that fuel subsidies were an inefficient way to help the poor, anyway. However, he noted that better ways were not necessarily available. Giving money directly to the poor to make up for the lost fuel savings would require a banking and credit infrastructure that often cannot be found in the developing world.\n\n\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t want to solve these countries\u2019 fiscal problems on the backs of their weakest citizens,\u201d Mr. Levi said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn the United States, a longstanding coalition of environmentalists and libertarians has sought to eliminate tax breaks and policies that support the fossil fuel industry. Eli Lehrer, the co-founder of the R Street Institute, a free-market think tank in Washington, said the oil industry did not need many of the tax breaks it received.\n\n\u201cI doubt that eliminating the intangible drilling cost write-off would reduce oil production at all,\u201d he said.\n\nCarlton Carroll, a spokesman for the American Petroleum Institute, said the tax breaks for his industry \u201care similar to other manufacturing sectors.\u201d He added, \u201cAs an industry, we pay higher taxes than any other.\u201d\n\nSuch arguments do not convince Mr. Lehrer, whose group is part of the Green Scissors coalition that includes environmentally conscious budget cutters across the political spectrum. \u201cThese subsidies on fossil fuels are a very good, transideological issue,\u201d he said. \u201cTo the left, it\u2019s a terrible act of environmental destruction. To the right, it\u2019s crony capitalism. And both sides are true.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20151205073550, "twitter": {"description": "Government subsidies for conventional energy still dwarf spending on the fight against climate change.
