Mayor Nutter pried a homeless man off a member of his security detail at City Hall after the man charged at him Tuesday.

Amateur video aired on 6ABC on Tuesday night shows the man rolling on the ground with the guard. Nutter grabbed the man and shouted “Stop! Stop!” and “You need to go.”

Another man tried to join the tussle but was stopped by a guard, the network reported.

Both men were allowed to walk free, and were not arrested or charged in the incident. One told 6ABC he was upset, believing that the upcoming World Meeting of Families could prevent homeless people from sleeping on the Benjamin Franklin Parkway.
