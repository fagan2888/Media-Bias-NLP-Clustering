Horrifying video of police officers stunning a man with a Taser and then proceeding to beat him on the ground after a horse chase has sparked an internal investigation by the San Bernardino County Sheriff’s office, to determine if law enforcement officials used excessive force when they punched and kicked him for several minutes.

The man, identified as Francis Jared Pusok, was suspected of stealing the horse off which he fell while police chased him on Thursday afternoon, in a desert altercation filmed by NBC Los Angeles. The footage shows Pusok falling to the ground after police fired a Taser at him during their pursuit. Multiple officers immediately assailed the suspect, beating him for several minutes after he had been Tased.

More details from NBC Los Angeles:

In the two minutes after the man was stunned with a Taser, it appeared deputies kicked him 17 times, punched him 37 times and struck him with batons four times. Thirteen blows appeared to be to the head. The horse stood idly nearby. The man did not appear to move from his position lying on the ground for more than 45 minutes. He did not appear to receive medical attention while deputies stood around him during that time.

Pusok has since been hospitalized with unknown injuries, along with three deputies who were also injured during the chase. Two suffered dehydration; the other was kicked by a horse. According to the suspect’s mother and girlfriend, the sheriff’s office has kept them in the dark about Pusok’s condition, and has yet to offer an explanation of the assault.
