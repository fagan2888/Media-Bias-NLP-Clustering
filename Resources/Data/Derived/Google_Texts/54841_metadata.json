To be fair, he planned to retire from \u201ccinema,\u201d and later called it a simple sabbatical, but a grueling 10-episode shoot in 73 days didn\u2019t look anything like taking a break.\n\nSoderbergh, who said making movies was no longer fun for him, seems to have recaptured that early joy in TV. The Knick is as close to cinema as anything on TV today. The sprawling period show, which marks Cinemax as a major contender in original programming, is scripted, directed and edited as episodic cinema, giving audiences everything they\u2019d except from Soderbergh-style storytelling.\n\n\u201cIf that\u2019s retirement \u2026\u201d sighed Clive Owen at the Rome Film Festival, out to promote the series before its premiere on Sky Atlantic HD in Italy on Nov. 11. \u201cHe only signed on to do the first, and he said to me halfway through the first season that he\u2019s going to come back and do the second season because he was having such a good time. That was very good to hear.\u201d\n\nRead more Amazon Picks Up Full Series of 'Hand of God' and Steven Soderbergh's 'Red Oaks'\n\nOwen originally signed up for the series for the strong material, and also because he wanted to work with Soderbergh. \u201cHe\u2019s incredible because he does everything,\u201d Owen told The Hollywood Reporter. \u201cHe lights, he operates, he directs and he edits. He leads from the front, everything and everybody. He\u2019s just incredibly hard working and focused. He\u2019s carrying a camera on his shoulder all day as well as everything else. I just think his work ethic is extraordinary.\u201d\n\nOwen was drawn to the series, in which he plays a standoffish, drug-addicted surgeon at the forefront of medicine for its brutal honesty in depicting New York City in 1900, one of the most active periods of medical research when life-changing discoveries were made literally overnight. \u201cYou felt that New York was a dangerous place, and you felt that the world of medicine was a dangerous place,\u201d he said. \u201cSteven always wanted to make a period drama where no one felt nostalgic.\u201d\n\nIndeed, nothing in The Knick, through its relentless operating table deaths, and ongoing corruption, racism and sexism, make the viewer fond of the era. Soderbergh also chose an edgy electronic score rather than typical period music.\n\nThe research that went into the series was massive, as Soderbergh insisted everything be true to the era\u2019s history. Owen believes any doctor would be impressed with the show\u2019s accuracy. \u201cSome doctor did ask me, \u2018What is it this medical thing you\u2019re doing?\u2019 I said, \u2018I\u2019m playing this doctor who\u2019s a drug addict, but he\u2019s also brilliant.\u2019 And he said, \u2018What\u2019s changed?\u2019 \u201d laughed Owen. \u201cScary. Scary, but funny.\u201d\n\nWhat can audiences expect from season two? Something \u201ceven wilder, I hope,\u201d said Owen. \u201cThe great thing about doing a show like this, we take it to places that are really quite shocking. But the beauty of setting all that up, and with Steven coming back to direct all 10 episodes again, we can hit the ground running. It\u2019s just really exciting to see how far we can push it. I\u2019m very, very excited about where it\u2019s going.\u201d\n\nAnd Owen promises that there are no plans to make his character more likable: \u201cHopefully not,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll be guarding against that.\u201d\n\nTwitter: @Aristonla", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Ariston Anderson", "description": "The actor is \"very, very excited\" for season two of 'The Knick'", "og": {"site_name": "The Hollywood Reporter", "description": "The actor is \"very, very excited\" for season two of 'The Knick'", "title": "Rome Film Festival: Clive Owen on Why Steven Soderbergh Isn\u2019t Retiring Anytime Soon", "url": "http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/rome-film-festival-clive-owen-741889", "image": {"width": 1047, "identifier": "//cdn4.thr.com/sites/default/files/2014/07/the_knick_clive_owen_a_p.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "height": 1572}, "type": "website"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-10-18 12:40:43", "sailthru.title": "Rome Film Festival: Clive Owen on Why Steven Soderbergh Isn\u2019t Retiring Anytime Soon", "fb": {"admins": 3111204}, "sailthru.vertical": "Television", "sailthru.tags": "Television,Cinemax,Clive Owen,Steven Soderbergh,Rome Film Festival,International", "sailthru.description": "The actor is \"very, very excited\" for season two of 'The Knick'", "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "\u201cIf that\u2019s retirement \u2026\u201d sighed Clive Owen at the Rome Film Festival, out to promote the series before its premiere on Sky Atlantic HD in Italy on Nov. 11.\nSoderbergh, who said making movies was no longer fun for him, seems to have recaptured that early joy in TV.\nThe research that went into the series was massive, as Soderbergh insisted everything be true to the era\u2019s history.\nThe actor is \"very, very excited\" for season two of 'The Knick'Steven Soderbergh took on Cinemax\u2019s The Knick just three weeks after announcing his retirement.\nI\u2019m very, very excited about where it\u2019s going.\u201dAnd Owen promises that there are no plans to make his character more likable: \u201cHopefully not,\u201d he said."}
