Cornyn?", "article_keywords": ["rating", "voting", "liberal", "congress", "senators", "conservative", "cornyn", "cruz", "voted", "sen", "republican", "stockman"], "article_url": "http://www.factcheck.org/2013/12/how-liberal-is-sen-cornyn/", "article_text": "Republican Rep. Steve Stockman of Texas says he\u2019s running against Sen. John Cornyn in the state\u2019s 2014 primary because the incumbent is a backstabbing \u201cliberal\u201d who only votes with Republicans \u201ctemporarily\u201d when an election approaches. But Cornyn\u2019s voting record shows otherwise.\n\nActually, Cornyn is rated among the most conservative of all senators, and for years he\u2019s voted in line with fellow Republican senators more often than all but a few of his GOP colleagues.\n\nIn a \u201cDear Patriot\u201d fundraising letter posted on Stockman\u2019s campaign website Dec. 10, the congressman began: \u201cYou are in a foxhole fighting to save our constitutional Republic \u2026 \u2026 and the last thing you need is a Republican bayonet in your back.\u201d\n\n\u2018Liberal\u2019 Cornyn?\n\nThe phrase \u201cliberal John Cornyn\u201d appears 20 times in the text of the letter and in the headline as well, as though constant repetition would make it true. For example, he says, \u201cliberal John Cornyn is now doing what he always does, spending four years voting like a Democrat, then spending the two years before an election pretending to be Republican.\u201d The sentence is underlined for emphasis, in the breathless style used by partisan fundraising appeals.\n\nThe fact is, however, that Cornyn was rated the second most conservative of all incumbent U.S. senators by the nonpartisan National Journal, based on his voting record in the last Congress, which sat during 2011 and 2012. He scored 93.8 percent on the Journal\u2019s \u201ccomposite\u201d conservative scale, which melds ratings on economic, social and foreign policy votes. He even edged out South Carolina Republican Sen. Jim DeMint, a Tea Party leader who has since left the Senate to head the conservative Heritage Foundation.\n\nOther conservative groups also rate Cornyn highly. The American Conservative Union scored his votes as 90 percent conservative in 2011, and 88 percent conservative in 2012 \u2014 both well above the 78 percent conservative average for all incumbent GOP senators during the two-year period. Cornyn\u2019s \u201clifetime\u201d ACU rating \u2014 covering his entire Senate career since 2002 \u2014 is 93 percent conservative.\n\nSimilarly, the anti-tax group Club for Growth has consistently rated Cornyn among the most conservative GOP senators over the years. His ranking has varied from third most conservative in 2010 to 19th most conservative in 2008. His lifetime CFG rating stood at 87 percent. Based on that, Club for Growth announced Dec. 10 that it wouldn\u2019t be supporting Stockman\u2019s primary challenge to Cornyn.\n\nThe anti-abortion National Right to Life Committee gave Cornyn a rating of 100 percent in the last Congress, and also 100 percent in the current Congress to date.\n\nAlso in the current Congress, DeMint\u2019s Heritage Action for America rates Cornyn\u2019s voting record as the ninth most conservative among current Republican senators, giving him a rating of 86 percent.\n\nIn his fundraising letter, Stockman claims to have a \u201cperfect 100% lifetime conservative rating,\u201d though he doesn\u2019t say what group might have awarded him that score. The American Conservative Union actually gave him a \u201clifetime\u201d rating of 92 percent in 1996 \u2014 based on his single previous term in Congress. (Some news reports have put his ACU lifetime rating at 100 percent, but that doesn\u2019t square with the actual rating posted on ACU\u2019s website. Stockman did have a perfect score in 1995, but then he scored 83 in 1996 \u2014 resulting in a 92 \u201clifetime\u201d rating.)\n\nTo be sure, Stockman\u2019s Heritage rating in the current Congress is a bit more conservative than Cornyn\u2019s, although based on different sets of votes and not precisely comparable. Heritage rates Stockman\u2019s 2013 record as 90 percent conservative and Cornyn\u2019s record 86 percent. Stockman ranks tied for 14th among all House members in the Heritage ratings, compared with Cornyn\u2019s ninth-place rating among senators.\n\nBut whether or not Stockman is truly more conservative than Cornyn, calling the senator \u201cliberal\u201d is far from accurate by any standard measure.\n\nHarry Reid\u2019s Republican?\n\nThe same can be said for Stockman\u2019s preposterous claim that Cornyn votes with Democrats except during elections:\n\nStockman: You see, liberal John Cornyn is only in office because he does two things. First, he\u2019s Harry Reid\u2019s Republican until before the election, when he temporarily starts voting Republican.\n\nThat\u2019s false. In the 112th Congress (2011-2012), Cornyn voted more consistently Republican than any other senator save for GOP Leader Mitch McConnell. Both voted with the majority of fellow GOP senators 92 percent of the time, according to the U.S. Congress Votes Database maintained by the Washington Post.\n\nPreviously, Cornyn voted Republican 94 percent of the time in the 111th Congress. That was edged out by only three other incumbents, who scored 95 percent.\n\nAnd the claim that Cornyn is \u201ctemporarily\u201d voting more Republican as the 2014 primary approaches is also false. In fact, he\u2019s voting a bit less Republican this year. His party-line voting has fallen to 88 percent since January. But that\u2019s still a solid number. It\u2019s precisely the average for all 45 incumbent Republican senators, according to a running tabulation by the Sunshine Foundation.\n\nCornyn is actually voting more consistently Republican than Texas\u2019 other senator, Ted Cruz, who voted the party line 83.6 percent of the time. That\u2019s of interest because Stockman is appealing to Cruz supporters.\n\nCornyn \u2018Betrayed\u2019 Cruz?\n\nStockman claims in his letter that Cornyn \u201cbetrayed\u201d Cruz by \u201cabandoning Republicans during the Obamacare filibuster\u201d and by \u201cvoting to fund Obamacare.\u201d Both those claims are off base.\n\nIn fact, the Cruz \u201cfilibuster\u201d \u2014 actually a 21-hour speech against the Affordable Care Act that didn\u2019t actually block or delay any vote \u2014 wasn\u2019t supported by most Senate Republicans, who (like Cornyn) stayed on the sidelines. The Cruz tactic was supported on the floor by just nine fellow senators: David Vitter of Louisiana, Mike Lee of Utah, Jeff Sessions of Alabama, Pat Roberts of Kansas, Mike Enzi of Wyoming, James Inhofe of Oklahoma, Jim Risch of Idaho, Marco Rubio of Florida and Rand Paul of Kentucky. So Cornyn didn\u2019t \u201cabandon Republicans,\u201d he was with the majority of GOP Senate members.\n\nAs for \u201cvoting to fund Obamacare,\u201d Cornyn actually voted \u2014 along with Cruz and 42 other Senate Republicans \u2014 against a Democratic amendment that restored funds for the Affordable Care Act to the version previously passed by the GOP-controlled House. That was as close as the Senate came to a straight up-or-down vote on \u201cdefunding\u201d Obamacare. Cornyn also lined up with Cruz and other GOP senators in voting against the amended bill to fund the entire federal government. It passed with only Democrats voting in favor, leading to a House-Senate standoff that produced a 16-day partial shutdown of the government.\n\nAnd later, Cornyn was among only 18 senators \u2014 including Cruz \u2014 who voted against the spending bill that reopened the government.\n\nFor the record, Cornyn\u2019s critics point to his vote in favor of proceeding to consideration of the House-passed funding bill before Democrats restored funding for the health care law. Cruz was among 19 Republican senators who voted to block consideration, while Cornyn was among 25 Senate Republicans who voted in favor (two did not vote).\n\nWhat\u2019s wrong with voting to consider a measure lacking Obamacare funding? \u201cAlthough Cornyn did vote against the final bill, he and all Republicans knew that voting for cloture to end debate would allow Senator Harry Reid to fund ObamaCare by a party-line vote, and thus a vote for cloture was a de facto vote to fund ObamaCare,\u201d argues a legislative affairs assistant for FreedomWorks, in an article re-posted on Stockman\u2019s site. But that\u2019s just an argument, not a fact.\n\nStockman\u2019s Need for Funds\n\nCornyn had nearly $7 million in campaign funds on hand as of the most recent reports, while Stockman had $32,000. So Stockman needs to open a lot of conservative purses and quickly if he is to have any hope of matching Cornyn\u2019s ability to spend in the coming primary campaign. The primary is March 4.\n\nJudging by his fundraising letter, Stockman isn\u2019t letting facts stand in his way.\n\n\u2014 Brooks Jackson", "article_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9a49\"", "article_summary": "In the 112th Congress (2011-2012), Cornyn voted more consistently Republican than any other senator save for GOP Leader Mitch McConnell.\nBut whether or not Stockman is truly more conservative than Cornyn, calling the senator \u201cliberal\u201d is far from accurate by any standard measure.\nPreviously, Cornyn voted Republican 94 percent of the time in the 111th Congress.\nThe same can be said for Stockman\u2019s preposterous claim that Cornyn votes with Democrats except during elections:Stockman: You see, liberal John Cornyn is only in office because he does two things.\nRepublican Rep.
