Or you\u2019re charged an obscure fee on your student loan or checking account. Or a payday lender raids your account without your permission. It\u2019s hard enough to take a financial provider to court over such claims, even under normal circumstances. But in a growing number of cases, consumers are barred from even that possibility.\n\nMandatory arbitration clauses hidden in the fine print of credit card, banking, cell phone and payday loan contracts prevent consumers from access to the judicial system when a dispute arises, and make class action lawsuits over pervasive injustices impossible. Instead, consumers who feel wronged must submit to an extra-judicial process with an arbitrator paid by their lenders \u2014 a playing field clearly tilted toward corporations.\n\nRelated: You Can No Longer Take Your Company to Court\n\nBecause the outcomes of arbitration cases are typically not public, we didn\u2019t know a lot about the scope of this system until this week. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, acting under a mandate from the Dodd-Frank Act, released a report to Congress on mandatory arbitration, one of the first empirical analyses of the practice. While CFPB did not attempt to evaluate its findings, the reality plainly shows through: Arbitration benefits corporations at the expense of their customers.\n\nOne problem for consumers in pursuing arbitration is that they have no idea it exists. CFPB found that three out of four consumers were unaware of whether their financial products included a mandatory arbitration clause. Those clauses are everywhere, though: 53 percent of credit cards, 86 percent of private student loans, 88 percent of cell phones, 92 percent of prepaid cards and 99 percent of payday loans have them in their contracts. This revelation only comes up when people consider their options after being ripped off, or when the company takes them to arbitration over a debt.\n\nKnowing about the arbitration clause may not help much, either. Despite the tens of millions of consumers why operate under those arbitration rules, only an average of 600 arbitration cases got filed annually between CFPB\u2019s study years of 2010 to 2012, with one in five of those likely filed by corporations. Maybe consumers shy away from the option because corporations have the upper hand in arbitration: In a sample of 1,060 debt dispute cases, corporations were given seven times as much in financial awards as consumers.\n\nRelated: The Sneaky Hidden Clause in Credit Card Agreements\n\nOf course, individual court cases are not such a boon for consumers either: Of 1,200 cases filed between 2010 and 2012, only two went to trial. The real reason corporations use mandatory arbitration is to prevent class action lawsuits. Those suits can cause real pain for corporations, including billions in damages. So they use the arbitration clause to block class action certification, given leeway to do this by a Supreme Court ruling, AT&T v. Concepcion. And 90 percent of all arbitration agreements studied by the CFPB prohibit even class action arbitration.\n\nIn other words, financial services providers like their chances when going up against resource-starved individuals, but find themselves less advantaged when those individuals can band together as a group. It\u2019s the same impulse that makes corporations hostile to unions.\n\nSome lawmakers hope that CFPB\u2019s study is just a first step. Sen. Al Franken (D-MN), who has highlighted the arbitration issue in the past, reacted to the study by urging that CFPB establish rules to ban mandatory arbitration clauses. \u201cA rule like that would go a long way toward keeping the big banks in line and making sure that justice is available to consumers who get swindled,\u201d Franken said in at a briefing yesterday in Washington. The Senator plans to reintroduce the Arbitration Fairness Act to eliminate arbitration clauses in consumer contracts. Americans for Financial Reform, a labor/progressive coalition, is also mobilizing for a new CFPB rule.\n\nThe industry argues that these arbitrations are cheaper and more efficient for everyone involved, implying that they return those savings from reducing civil suit costs to their customers. But CFPB compared costs between companies with no arbitration clause and those with them, and found \u201cno statistically significant evidence\u201d of cheaper prices. Financial services providers simply pocket the savings they get from lowering their risk of exposure to legal action from their contract violations. \u201cIf tens of millions of consumer\u2019s rights are being trampled and it\u2019s not lowering costs, why do we have these agreements?\u201d Franken asked yesterday. \u201cIt\u2019s so that big businesses can shield themselves from liability when they act against the consumer\u2019s best interest and that is just wrong.\u201d\n\nRelated: The Hidden Risks in Your Credit Cards\u2019 Fine Print\n\nIn a way, there\u2019s a parallel between corporations mandating arbitration cases and the investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS) process placed into international trade agreements. Under this process, corporations can sue sovereign governments if they believe regulations violate the terms of the trade agreement. Like arbitration, ISDS stays outside national courts, and corporations can win cash awards based on expectations of future profits lost through the regulatory changes. Private lawyers, not judges, hear the cases.\n\nSo the lesson here is that corporations don\u2019t respect the judicial system as much as they want to bend it to their advantage. As 100 law professors wrote in a letter to Congress and the U.S. Trade Representative this week, ISDS \u201cgrants foreign corporations a special legal privilege,\u201d weakening the rule of law. You can say the same things about mandatory arbitration clauses. In both cases, corporations can step outside the legal system and into a process they feel they can control, whether to chill regulations or to stop individuals from suing for relief.\n\nBoth ISDS and consumer arbitration have no appeals process. They feature no public oversight of the arbitrators. They create no precedent on corporations that they must follow. So there\u2019s no accountability, no review and no fairness. The only difference is that ISDS exists as an option for corporations; consumers have no alternative but arbitration.\n\nThe good news is we have a consumer agency now that has managed to study arbitration, with a focus on how it affects ordinary people, not the financial industry. I hope they finish the job.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Let\u2019s say you\u2019re charged a higher interest rate on your credit card than the terms of", "title": "The Corporate Giveaway Hidden in Your Credit Card Contract", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2015/03/13/Corporate-Giveaway-Hidden-Your-Credit-Card-Contract", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/04082010_Credit_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2015/03/13/Corporate-Giveaway-Hidden-Your-Credit-Card-Contract", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/04082010_Credit_article.jpg", "creator": "@ddayen", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Let\u2019s say you\u2019re charged a higher interest rate on your credit card than the terms of", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe08ca\"", "article_summary": "Under this process, corporations can sue sovereign governments if they believe regulations violate the terms of the trade agreement.\nBut in a growing number of cases, consumers are barred from even that possibility.\nLet\u2019s say you\u2019re charged a higher interest rate on your credit card than the terms of your contract specifies, perhaps even higher than state limits.\nCFPB found that three out of four consumers were unaware of whether their financial products included a mandatory arbitration clause.\nThe only difference is that ISDS exists as an option for corporations; consumers have no alternative but arbitration."}
