The NASDAQ is up 275 percent, and the S&P 500 is up 210 percent. Wall Street is booming!\n\nThe Washington bubble is more like a Kevlar, economic shield. Six of the 10 richest counties in America surround our nation\u2019s capital. Federal employees have a 99 percent job security rate and are more likely to die than lose their jobs because of a government layoff or misconduct.\n\nWashington is more dysfunctional than ever; but the number of insiders, interest groups, lobbyists, and record-breaking salaries keeps swelling.\n\nAdvertisement \u2013 story continues below\n\nSome are doing great in President Barack Obama\u2019s economy, but Main Street America and South Carolina tell a different story.\n\nNinety-three million Americans don\u2019t have jobs, and many have seen their full-time jobs with benefits become two part-time jobs with no benefits. We\u2019ve had 40 years of stagnant wages for the bottom 90 percent of American workers.\n\nMeanwhile, the cost of healthcare, education, and housing keeps ballooning. One in four American families pays more than half their income on housing.\n\nAdvertisement \u2013 story continues below\n\nFor the first time in history, we have a president who celebrates government dependency and discourages hard work. The goal of Obamacare is permanent government dependency. Forty-six million Americans depend on the government for food stamps. In South Carolina, that\u2019s 17 percent of the population.\n\nAmerica\u2019s workers have been getting punched in the gut. The U.S. has lost 5 million manufacturing jobs in the last 15 years. We demonize the trades and push a one-size-fits-all, overpriced college education for everyone.\n\nWashington signs unenforced trade deals with foreign countries and does nothing as the Chinese manipulate their currency, rip off American products, and subsidize industries.\n\nWashington looks the other way and ignores the law so we can import low-wage labor, undercut American workers, and drive wages lower than the Dead Sea.\n\nAdvertisement \u2013 story continues below\n\nI\u2019m running for president because there\u2019s a huge disconnect between Washington and the Real World. There\u2019s a difference between making a speech and making government accountable to the people who pay for it.\n\nAs governor, I defeated the Clinton machine. I cut taxes nearly 100 times, balanced the budget every year for 10 years, and raised average family income by 50 percent, despite facing the most Democrat legislature in the country.\n\nAs president, I will protect Social Security and Medicare. I will never rob seniors of the benefits our government promised them and forced them to pay for. I\u2019ll also repeal Obamacare and return the $700 billion Obamacare raided from Medicare.\n\nHillary Clinton has made the minimum wage central to her presidential campaign. Instead of fighting over the minimum wage, I\u2019ll focus on solutions to help every American earn his or her maximum wage.\n\nWe can never create prosperity for working people, grow our economy, and restore America as the greatest country on earth if we punish productivity and subsidize reckless irresponsibility.\n\nThat\u2019s why as president, I\u2019ll pass the FairTax and abolish the IRS to let every American worker keep his full paycheck. My plan will untax the poor and untax seniors living on a fixed income. It will also bring trillions of dollars in offshore investment and manufacturing back to the United States.\n\nThe Washington elites will spend millions falsely attacking me because they know I am not one of them and I will not protect them at the expense of hardworking American taxpayers.\n\nBut now, more than ever, we need a president who will fight for American workers, families, and seniors \u2014 not Wall Street and Washington elites \u2014 and give every American hope in a brighter, more prosperous future.\n\nThe views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by the owners of this website.", "article_metadata": {"description": "We need a president who will fight for American workers, families, and seniors \u2014 not Wall Street and Washington elites \u2014 and give every American hope in a brighter, more prosperous future.", "author": "Mike Huckabee", "og": {"site_name": "Western Journalism", "description": "Some are doing great in President Barack Obama\u2019s economy, but...", "title": "Here's Proof That Obama Has Been A Gut Punch To America's Economy, And How To Fix It", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 1500, "identifier": "http://www.westernjournalism.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/obamacrats.jpg", "height": 1000}, "updated_time": "2015-05-13T16:17:28-07:00", "url": "http://www.westernjournalism.com/fight-for-families-not-the-elites/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "We need a president who will fight for American workers, families, and seniors \u2014 not Wall Street and Washington elites \u2014 and give every American hope in a brighter, more prosperous future.", "creator": "@WestJournalism", "image": "http://www.westernjournalism.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/obamacrats.jpg", "title": "Here's Proof That Obama Has Been A Gut Punch To America's Economy, And How To Fix It", "site": "@WestJournalism", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "DC.date.issued": "2015-05-13T11:24:25-07:00", "fb": {"app_id": 275784739127435, "pages": 123624513983}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.westernjournalism.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/android-chrome-192x192.png", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/WesternJournalism", "section": "Opinion", "tag": "United States Of America", "published_time": "2015-05-13T11:24:25-07:00", "modified_time": "2015-05-13T16:17:28-07:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "unemployment, united states of america, politics, nation, religion"}, "article_summary": "We\u2019ve had 40 years of stagnant wages for the bottom 90 percent of American workers.\nWall Street is booming!\nWashington looks the other way and ignores the law so we can import low-wage labor, undercut American workers, and drive wages lower than the Dead Sea.\nAdvertisement \u2013 story continues belowSome are doing great in President Barack Obama\u2019s economy, but Main Street America and South Carolina tell a different story.\nWe need a president who will fight for American workers, families, and seniors \u2014 not Wall Street and Washington elites \u2014 and give every American hope in a brighter, more prosperous future."}
