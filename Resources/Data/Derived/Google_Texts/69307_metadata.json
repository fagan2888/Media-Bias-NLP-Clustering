(Photo: Doug Hood)Buy Photo\n\nHow many push-ups does it take to change the world? Jim Raffone is trying to find out.\n\nThe Manalapan dad\u2019s quest to save his 6-year-old son from the grip of Duchenne muscular dystrophy, a rare and fatal disease, has inspired thousands of people to drop to the ground. By collecting $10 for 10 push-ups, the family\u2019s JAR of Hope Foundation has raised $70,000 for Duchenne research.\n\nNow Raffone is taking the campaign to another level.\n\nOn Aug. 23, the foundation is coordinating an attempt to break the world record for most people doing push-ups at once. The gathering, called \u201cStrength in Numbers,\u201d takes place at the Manalapan Recreation Center.\n\nRaffone is expecting a huge turnout, including former New York Giants cornerback Mark Collins, former Rutgers football running back Joe Martinek and an adjudicator from Guinness World Records.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m getting the chills just thinking about it,\u201d he said. \u201cI believe we can raise close to $50,000 on one day. It\u2019s been absolutely amazing, the support and understanding we\u2019ve received.\u201d\n\nAll hands on deck\n\nDuchenne muscular dystrophy is a genetic condition that results in a progressive loss of strength. Eventually the weakness leads to paralysis and fatal heart and lung problems. Life expectancy is in the 20s.\n\nJamesy Raffone was four when he was diagnosed with a mutation of Duchenne that affects just 120 boys in the United States. Because there are so few cases, there was no movement to find a cure. Jim created one, going from gym to gym throughout the region, enlisting roomfuls of fitness fanatics to do 10 push-ups for $10.\n\nAlong the way Jim met Joe Lisi, a fellow Manalapan resident and college football analyst who hosts a show on Yahoo Sports Radio Network. Lisi connected him with the football community. Collins -- a key player on the Giants\u2019 1986 and 1990 championship teams -- got on board right away. Others too.\n\n\u201cI fell for the story and I feel for Jim\u2019s son because I have kids too,\u201d said Lisi, a lymphoma survivor. \u201cSome people just give money (to a cause) but don\u2019t utilize the resources they have.\u201d\n\nLike networking. As word spread about Jamesy Raffone, JAR of Hope started holding larger-scale events. On July 18, more than 1,100 people showed up at iPlay America in Freehold to break the world record for simultaneous push-ups. The current record of 615 was set earlier this year in India.\n\nJamesy Raffone with parents Jim and Karen. (Photo: Tom Costello)\n\nThe event netted $21,000, but not the record. Guinness has rigorous certification standards. Without a Guinness rep on site, Raffone had to supply aerial photos of the event. He enlisted the use of a drone, but rain prevented its launch.\n\nThe record chase could have ended there. It didn\u2019t.\n\nA second chance\n\nRaffone\u2019s very first JAR of Hope fundraiser was running the New York City Marathon. He did it with no prior training. So organizing a second attempt at the Guinness record, bigger and better than the first, was a no-brainer. Pazzo Restaurant and Frogbridge gave him a boost by signing on as sponsors.\n\n\u201cDuchenne has never had such a spotlight shined on it,\u201d he said. \u201cTo get the word out there to so many people, this will solidify everything I\u2019ve been trying to do for my son.\u201d\n\nTo ensure the record\u2019s certification, sponsors kicked in $7,000 to bring a Guinness adjudicator to Manalapan Aug. 23. Participants must do push-ups at their own pace for one minute.\n\nAll told, Raffone expects crowd of 2,000, including ex-NFL linebacker Morlon Greenwood and motivational speaker Lee Rubin, a former Penn State football captain. Like \u201cJersey Joe\u201d Martinek, who spent 2012 on the New York Giants\u2019 practice squad and now works as an IT recruiter in Matawan, people with no prior connection to the Raffones are drawn in by their story.\n\nBuy Photo Joe Martinek says he sees the Raffones as \u201crole models.\u201d (Photo: File photo)\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t wait to meet Jim and his family,\u201d Martinek said. \u201cThey\u2019re role models with what they\u2019re doing. You always want to be around people like that.\u201d\n\nOne group has not responded to Raffone\u2019s movement, at least not yet. He invited 10 families dealing with Duchenne to last month\u2019s event. None came.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve invited 20, 30 families now for this Guinness attempt,\u201d he said. \u201cAs parents, we should let these kids see that people are coming out to benefit them and really make an impact, screaming to the world that this disease has to stop.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a tall order, but Raffone sees progress. Jamesy gets treated by a groundbreaking mix of therapies, including three-hour stints in a hyperbaric chamber several days a week.\n\n\u201cHe handles it like a champ,\u201d his dad said. \u201cHe knows this is what he needs to do to save his muscle tissue. I believe we\u2019re changing the trajectory of this disease by simply seeing his stamina get better. He\u2019s able to run and play with his friends longer than he used to.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m hoping we can keep this going until a cure\u2019s found.\u201d\n\nTo preregister for \u201cStrength in Numbers\u201d by making a donation to JAR of Hope, visit www.crowdrise.com/23august.
