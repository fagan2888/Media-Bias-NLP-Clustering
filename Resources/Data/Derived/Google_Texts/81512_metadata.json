They instead suspended her only for the offense of disclosing confidential case information in emails and transferred her from Breckinridge County to Hardin County.\n\nAnd on Bond\u2019s first day on the job in Hardin, April 1, her new troubles began.\n\nBond, who resigned her job June 1, is facing criminal charges along with Joseph W. Applegate Jr. \u2014 the name of the man she was accused of having an intimate relationship with in Breckinridge County, a relationship she denied and the cabinet dropped as part of its effort to fire her.\n\nBond and Applegate, identified in court records as her fiance, are charged with six counts of complicity to make false complaints of child abuse and domestic violence against Corey Chaney and April Rodgers, a young couple who lived with their infant daughter over the apartment Bond and Applegate shared in Elizabethtown.\n\nThe calls began April 1 and continued until late May, when Elizabethtown police charged Bond and Applegate with calling in false, anonymous complaints about their neighbors to the state\u2019s child abuse hotline run by the same agency that employed Bond as a social worker.\n\nCriminal complaints say Bond and Applegate admitted to police they made false reports over about two months.\n\nBoth have pleaded not guilty. Neither Bond nor her lawyer, Adam Cart, responded to a request for comment; Applegate\u2019s lawyer, Evan Spalding, declined to comment.\n\nCabinet officials said that while they are appalled by Bond\u2019s alleged actions and worked aggressively to fire her, they lacked enough witnesses and evidence to substantiate all of the allegations from Breckinridge. Furthermore, some of the witnesses to alleged events were children and could not be called to testify at personnel proceedings, the cabinet said in a statement by spokeswoman Jill Midkiff.\n\nMidkiff said the cabinet must follow state personnel regulations in such cases.\n\n\u201cFortunately, Bond resigned amidst the criminal charges she now faces and is no longer employed by the cabinet,\u201d Midkiff said.\n\nStill, Barry Sullivan, a lawyer who represents Chaney and Rodgers, said he is disappointed that Bond was merely suspended and allowed to move to a new county where within two months she was charged with the offenses against his clients.\n\n\u201cThat is shocking and sad and disgusting,\u201d Sullivan said.\n\nChaney and Rodgers told The Courier-Journal that the false reports of domestic violence and child abuse sent police and social workers to the couple\u2019s home repeatedly to investigate, disrupting their lives and leaving them frightened and concerned.\n\nChaney said he is angered by the cabinet\u2019s decision not to fire Bond and for not better supervising her. He also faults the state\u2019s system of accepting anonymous child abuse calls as making it too easy to call in false allegations.\n\n\u201cSomething has to be done about this,\u201d he said. \u201cSomeone who hides behind the system and preys on children and their families is as low as it gets.\u201d\n\nThe case in Breckinridge\n\nThe cabinet began investigating allegations against Bond involving a Breckinridge family last year.\n\nShe was assigned to work with the family in June. The household included a married couple, three children and an adult male friend of the husband\u2019s, identified as \u201cClient 5,\u201d state records said.\n\nOn Nov. 7, Bond was removed from handling any social service cases and placed on desk duty while the cabinet investigated.\n\nOn Feb. 25, the cabinet sent Bond an 18-page letter detailing its conclusions and notifying her it intended to fire her. In addition to citing her for repeatedly emailing confidential information about cases to herself, her relatives and others, it listed multiple problems with her work with the Breckinridge family.\n\nAmong the allegations:\n\nBond frequently socialized with the family, shopping with them, visiting on weekends, eating with family members at restaurants and developing a relationship as a friend rather than maintaining a professional one as a social worker.\n\nShe helped the family clean the home, took \u201cstaged\u201d photos for the social service file, making it appear the home was clean, and bought groceries for them.\n\nBond failed to report a previous relationship with the man identified as \u201cClient 5\u201d and continued it while he was staying at the home. Others in the home told cabinet officials that the two dated, kissed and Bond once climbed on his lap in front of others at the family\u2019s home and gave him a \u201clap dance.\u201d\n\nBond in a Nov. 19 memo in her personnel file denied most of the allegations and called them \u201chearsay without proof.\u201d Some of the family members who gave statements to the cabinet about her behavior were \u201cdishonest, manipulative and at one time, hated me,\u201d she said.\n\nShe also blamed a state juvenile justice worker involved with one of the family\u2019s children for some of the allegations, saying \u201cshe has intentionally tried to work against me with this case to cause me undue and unnecessary grief.\u201d\n\nShe said she tried to appear friendly in order to gain the family\u2019s trust and cooperation but denied excessive socializing with them.\n\nAs for not reporting the rape allegation, Bond said she attempted to call police but \u201cmy cellphone died.\u201d While she was waiting for it to charge, Bond said, she fell asleep and when she awoke, had several voice mail messages from the woman begging her not to report it.\n\nShe also described the woman as unreliable because of mental health and alcohol problems.\n\nAs for her relationship with the man staying in the home, Bond acknowledged dating him \u201ca few times\u201d when she worked in Daviess County. When she realized he was staying at the family\u2019s home in Breckinridge County, \u201cI did not realize it was a conflict of interest because I didn\u2019t work with him directly,\u201d Bond said in her memo.\n\nRelationship with Client 5\n\nIn an initial letter seeking to fire Bond, cabinet officials said she failed to report her relationship with Client 5, \u201cwhich created a conflict in providing services to a family,\u201d resulting in \u201cinappropriate and unprofessional conduct.\u201d\n\nBond insisted she had no involvement with Client 5 while she worked with the family, though she acknowledged knowing him prior to taking on the family\u2019s case, having met him online and dating him.\n\nBut Bond did not tell her supervisors of any past relationship with the man until after Nov. 7, when Bond was removed from handling cases while under investigation and placed on desk duty, the records said. On Nov. 10, Bond called a supervisor and informed her she had \u201cgone out on a date\u201d with Client 5 and should have told her supervisors because of the potential conflict.\n\nClient 5, while staying with the Breckinridge County family, \u201cdid ask me if I would go out with him \u2026 but I advised him while he was living in that home I could not date him,\u201d Bond wrote in her memo.\n\nShe also denied allegations from members of the family that she kissed Client 5, gave him a \u201clap dance,\u201d had sent him a cellphone photo of her in her bra and panties and that he had purchased a ring for her.\n\n\u201cTo my knowledge, he did not buy me a ring,\u201d Bond said in her memo.\n\nOn Jan. 7, more than two months before the cabinet took final personnel action against Bond, a co-worker in the Breckinridge County cabinet office provided a written statement that on Dec. 15, 2014, Bond showed off a ring and said she was engaged to be married to J.W. Applegate, according to personnel records.\n\nAnother worker said Bond told her in early January that she was engaged to J.W. Applegate and \u201cwasn\u2019t that crazy that she was engaged to a guy with the same name as the guy she was in trouble for at work.\u201d\n\nAnd a Breckinridge County woman, Shawna Beauchamp, who described herself as a longtime, former friend of Bond, told The Courier-Journal that Bond had been involved with Applegate for about a year, including the period when he was staying with the family in Breckinridge County.\n\nOn Dec. 12, Beauchamp said Bond sent her a text message with a photo of an engagement ring from Applegate with the caption \u201cI said YES.\u201d\n\nBeauchamp said she knew the couple well, visited with them often and that Applegate showed her the engagement ring last year before he presented it to Bond.\n\n\u201cTotally excited\u201d\n\nBond was allowed to present her defense to cabinet officials at a hearing March 10.\n\nOn March 17, cabinet officials notified Bond they were dropping plans to fire her and instead were suspending her.\n\nHer reaction surprised the supervisor who delivered the news.\n\n\u201cCan\u2019t say I\u2019ve ever had someone clap and be totally excited about a 10-day suspension before today,\u201d the supervisor noted wryly in an email to other cabinet officials.\n\nOn June 1, five days after she was charged with filing false abuse complaints in Elizabethtown, Bond resigned her job with the cabinet.\n\nContact Deborah Yetter at 502-582-4228 or at dyetter@courier-journal.com.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://cjky.it/1F88Mya", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Slapped with a 10-day suspension for misconduct, state social worker Beth Bond clapped her hands in delight and thanked her supervisor, telling her she was \u201camazing,\u201d according to state personnel records.", "og": {"site_name": "The Courier-Journal", "description": "Slapped with a 10-day suspension for misconduct, state social worker Beth Bond clapped her hands in delight and thanked her supervisor, telling her she was \u201camazing,\u201d according to state personnel records.", "title": "Social worker had troubled career before arrest", "url": "http://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/local/2015/08/29/state-social-worker-troubled-career/32275565/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/courier-journal.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Slapped with a 10-day suspension for misconduct, state social worker Beth Bond clapped her hands in delight and thanked her supervisor, telling her she was \u201camazing,\u201d according to state personnel records.", "title": "Social worker had troubled career before arrest", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/ff0ae5789c33ed6fad1bd51f2989b420f77b5e1b/c=0-96-576-672&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/08/28/Louisville/B9318574400Z.1_20150828161131_000_GU0BOO0AF.1-0.jpg", "creator": "@courierjournal", "site": "@courierjournal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600030236", "fb": {"app_id": 128534137209813}, "viewport": "width=1070", "article": {"author": "Deborah Yetter"}, "Content-Type": "text/html;
