It is probable, however, that none will top this cover of a 1966 Astros souvenier program:\n\nFor the non-baseball fans among you, the guy in the rocking chair represents a rather leery-looking member of the Houston Astros, who is helping a little bear cub (the mascot of the Chicago Cubs) drink from a milk bottle labeled \"LSD.\" Because 1966, right?\n\nMaybe not. Over at SB Nation's Bleed Cubbie Blue, writer Al Yellon notes that there's an asterisk after \"LSD\"; and that in small print below under the Astro's baseball it says \"* Leo S. Durocher,\" who was then the manager of the Cubs. The program was for the June 10-12 Cubs-Astros series. In his previous visit to the new Astrodome, Durocher (one of Nick Gillespie's favorite baseball miscreants) had slammed the space-age facility after his team got swept, calling it a \"$45 million stadium with a 10-cent infield,\" deriding its revolutionary Astro-turf as \"nylon,\" and referring to the Astros as a \"bush organization\" (he wasn't talking about the political dynasty in Houston, so far as we know). So it stands to reason that the cover was a deliberate tweak to Durocher's ample schnozz.\n\nIt's a convincing explanation, and Yellin marshals plenty of other historical evidence. BUT:\n\nNow, Durocher's middle initial wasn't \"S\" -- his middle name was \"Ernest.\" It does appear that it could have been a drug reference, which seems very odd in that buttoned-down era. Some have speculated it was for \"Lake Shore Drive\" in Chicago -- but no one in Chicago referred to Lake Shore Drive as \"LSD\" in 1966. That didn't happen until the 1970s.\n\nYou can never trust artists, is what I would add. That, and sports mascots are just like acid, minus the fun (and trails).\n\nLink via Baseball Think Factory.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "The best souvenier program illustration ever, explained", "title": "Baseball Was So Much Better When You Could Dose Team Mascots with LSD", "url": "http://reason.com/blog/2015/02/19/baseball-was-so-much-better-when-you-cou", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14243795996960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The best souvenier program illustration ever, explained", "title": "Baseball Was So Much Better When You Could Dose Team Mascots with LSD", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14243795996960.jpg", "creator": "@mattwelch", "site": "@reason", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 17548474116}, "article": {"tag": "Culture", "published_time": "2015-02-19T21:08:00+00:00", "author": "http://reason.com/people/matt-welch"}, "msvalidate.01": "212A68A07785B3080038A845C4EE8905", "google-site-verification": "-AmMiilAN-pnjWt369CUWae-VQ-b9wmH4fSGyhbkQxw", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3928\"", "article_summary": "Some have speculated it was for \"Lake Shore Drive\" in Chicago -- but no one in Chicago referred to Lake Shore Drive as \"LSD\" in 1966.\nBUT:Now, Durocher's middle initial wasn't \"S\" -- his middle name was \"Ernest.\"\nOver at SB Nation's Bleed Cubbie Blue, writer Al Yellon notes that there's an asterisk after \"LSD\"; and that in small print below under the Astro's baseball it says \"* Leo S.
