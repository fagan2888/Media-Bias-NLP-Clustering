Full of themselves, they enacted both laws with next to no buy-in from Republicans on Capitol Hill.\n\n\u201cDemocrats blew the opportunity the American people gave them,\u201d Schumer said, reflecting on the past five years. \u201cWe took their mandate and put all our focus on the wrong problem \u2013 health care reform.\u201d\n\nSchumer is partly right. Democrats did, indeed, blow it.\n\nBut not by choosing the wrong legislative priorities \u2013 the economic stimulus plan and Obamacare \u2013 but by enacting legislation of such tremendous impact \u2013 for better or worse \u2013 on a strictly partisan basis.\n\nIndeed, the price tag for the stimulus was $831 billion, which was greater than the cost of military operations during the Vietnam War. Obamacare was an extreme makeover of the health care system, representing one-sixth of the nation\u2019s economy.\n\nWhen legislation of such magnitude becomes the law of the land, it should be with the support of not just a single party \u2013 even if it temporarily enjoys political hegemony.\n\nThat brings us to Mr. Obama\u2019s misuse of his executive authority to effectively bestow amnesty (at least until he\u2019s out of office) upon as many as 5 million illegal immigrants before Republican majorities take control of both chambers of Congress in January.\n\nThe president thinks he has done a service to those \u201cliving in the shadows,\u201d 60 percent of whom are Mexican nationals and another 15 percent of whom hail from Central American countries.\n\nSo vainglorious is Mr. Obama, he probably reckons that history will favorably remember him for legalizing the undocumented the way Abraham Lincoln is remembered for freeing the slaves.\n\nBut the far more likely scenario is that Mr. Obama will be remembered for blowing the historic opportunity to sign a transformative immigration reform law supported by Democrats and Republicans alike.\n\nIndeed, Republican leaders on the Hill were prepared to negotiate on comprehensive immigration reform with the Obama White House and congressional Democrats.\n\nBut Mr. Obama decided to take unilateral action on immigration, shaking his fist at the incoming Republican Congress and all but destroying the prospect of an immigration law over the next two years.\n\nThat\u2019s bad news for the nation\u2019s estimated 11 million illegal immigrants because there was, until recently, a national consensus on immigration policy, with rank-and-file Democrats and Republicans alike supportive of comprehensive reform.\n\nRather than grow that consensus, Mr. Obama eroded it. That was borne out in September by an ABC News-Washington Post poll in which 60 percent of Americans said they disapproved of the way the president was handling immigration issues.\n\nMr. Obama has made the same regrettable mistake with immigration reform that he made with health care reform. Rather than bend his energy to finding common ground with Republicans on legislation of great national import, he decided he\u2019d do things entirely his own way.\n\nThat\u2019s why Obamacare does not to this day enjoy the support of the American people.\n\nAnd it\u2019s why many of us who heretofore supported comprehensive immigration reform, as an act of grace toward the nation\u2019s undocumented, now think that such reform should be left to Mr. Obama\u2019s successor.", "article_metadata": {"geo.placename": "Santa Ana", "geo.region": "US-CA", "content_section": "commentary", "description": "Opinion: Joseph Perkins: Obama did it his way; Democrats shown highway | obama, democrats, immigration, reform, american, republicans, care, way, republican, nation", "geo.position": "33.745573;-117.867834", "author": "JOSEPH PERKINS", "og": {"site_name": "The Orange County Register", "description": "Chuck Schumer committed truth this week.", "title": "Joseph Perkins: Obama did it his way; Democrats will pay", "url": "http://www.ocregister.com/articles/obama-643546-democrats-immigration.html", "image": "http://images.onset.freedom.com/ocregister/gallery/nfo6i2-b88270998z.120141126152545000g096irn6.10.jpg", "locale": "en-US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://images.onset.freedom.com/ocregister/gallery/nfo6i2-b88270998z.120141126152545000g096irn6.10.jpg"}, "description": "Chuck Schumer committed truth this week.", "site": "@ocregister", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Joseph Perkins: Obama did it his way; Democrats will pay"}, "content_author": "JOSEPH PERKINS", "fb": {"app_id": 107698536003308}, "content_thumbnail": "http://images.onset.freedom.com/ocregister/thumb/nfo6i2-b88270998z.120141126152545000g096irn6.10.jpg", "content_type": "article", "ICBM": "33.745573, -117.867834", "Keywords": "obama, democrats, immigration, reform, american, republicans, care, way, republican, nation", "publication_date": "2014-11-26", "access-type": "free", "section": "commentary", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "content_title": "Joseph Perkins: Obama did it his way; Democrats will pay"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcdb40\"", "article_summary": "Mr. Obama has made the same regrettable mistake with immigration reform that he made with health care reform.\nSo vainglorious is Mr. Obama, he probably reckons that history will favorably remember him for legalizing the undocumented the way Abraham Lincoln is remembered for freeing the slaves.\nIndeed, Republican leaders on the Hill were prepared to negotiate on comprehensive immigration reform with the Obama White House and congressional Democrats.\nRather than grow that consensus, Mr. Obama eroded it.\nBut the far more likely scenario is that Mr. Obama will be remembered for blowing the historic opportunity to sign a transformative immigration reform law supported by Democrats and Republicans alike."}
