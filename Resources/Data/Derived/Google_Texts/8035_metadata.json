HealthSouth estimates that it will realize a tax benefit with a net present value of $125 million to $150 million.\n\nHealthSouth shares popped 8.6% to 47 on the stock market today, retaking their 50-day moving average. HealthSouth stock hit a record 47.96 on April 28.\n\nThe inpatient-outpatient health care provider has an IBD Composite Rating of 84 out of 99, meaning its shares outperform 84% of all stocks in the market as measured by fundamental and technical factors.\n\n\u201cThe acquisition of the operations of Reliant Hospital Partners furthers HealthSouth\u2019s position as a leading provider of post-acute services,\u201d said Jay Grinney, HealthSouth president and CEO, in a statement Thursday.\n\n\u201cReliant\u2019s portfolio of high-quality inpatient rehabilitation hospitals complements our networks in the highly competitive Houston, Dallas-Fort Worth and Austin, Texas, markets while providing entry into new markets in Abilene, Texas; Dayton, Ohio; and the greater Boston metropolitan area.\n\nHealthSouth will get Reliant\u2019s 11 inpatient rehabilitation hospitals in Texas, Massachusetts and Ohio, and an additional three inpatient satellite locations in Massachusetts for a total of 902 beds. HealthSouth already has operations in 33 states and Puerto Rico, and says the buyout brings its portfolio of free-standing inpatient rehabilitation facilities to 120.\n\nMany hospitals are looking to expand their services to help cut costs and bring in higher-paying patients because of the impact of ObamaCare, slowing growth in Medicare and lower reimbursements.\n\nIn late March, Tenet Healthcare (THC) formed a joint venture with United Surgical Partners International to attain a broader lineup of services.\n\nThe $2.6 billion Tenet-USPI venture will have ownership interests in 244 ambulatory surgery centers, 16 short-stay surgical hospitals and 20 imaging centers in 29 states.\n\nHealthSouth recently formed a joint venture too, but on a much smaller scale. It teamed up with West Tennessee Healthcare in late May to own and operate a 48-bed inpatient rehabilitation hospital in Jackson, Tennessee.\n\nFollow Alissa Williams on Twitter: @IBD_AWilliams.", "article_metadata": {"description": "As the health care industry shifts in reaction to ObamaCare and slowing growth in Medicare, HealthSouth announced Thursday that it has agreed to buy the", "og": {"site_name": "Investor's Business Daily", "description": "As the health care industry shifts in reaction to ObamaCare and slowing growth in Medicare, HealthSouth announced Thursday that it has agreed to buy the operations of Reliant Hospital Partners for \u2026", "title": "HealthSouth Hospital Buyout To Boost Earnings", "url": "http://www.investors.com/news/healthsouth-buys-reliant-hospital-partners-operations/", "image": {"width": 512, "identifier": "http://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-ibd-favicon-v7.png", "height": 512}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary", "creator": "@IBDInvestors"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-ibd-favicon-v7-270x270.png", "date": "2015-06-11 10:08:00:-08:00", "article": {"published_time": "2015-06-11T10:08:00+00:00", "modified_time": "-001-11-30T00:00:00+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "It teamed up with West Tennessee Healthcare in late May to own and operate a 48-bed inpatient rehabilitation hospital in Jackson, Tennessee.\nHealthSouth already has operations in 33 states and Puerto Rico, and says the buyout brings its portfolio of free-standing inpatient rehabilitation facilities to 120.\nHealthSouth will get Reliant\u2019s 11 inpatient rehabilitation hospitals in Texas, Massachusetts and Ohio, and an additional three inpatient satellite locations in Massachusetts for a total of 902 beds.\n\u201cThe acquisition of the operations of Reliant Hospital Partners furthers HealthSouth\u2019s position as a leading provider of post-acute services,\u201d said Jay Grinney, HealthSouth president and CEO, in a statement Thursday.\nIn late March, Tenet Healthcare (THC) formed a joint venture with United Surgical Partners International to attain a broader lineup of services."}
