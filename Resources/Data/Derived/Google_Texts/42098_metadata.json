Here\u2019s how Pew defines the Faith And Family Left:\n\nThe Faith and Family Left combine strong support for activist government with conservative attitudes on many social issues. They are highly diverse \u2013 this is the only typology group that is \u201cmajority-minority.\u201d The Faith and Family Left favor increased government aid for the poor even if it adds to the deficit and believe that government should do more to solve national problems. They oppose same-sex marriage and legalizing marijuana. Religion and family are at the center of their lives.\n\nThey have more blacks, Hispanics, and immigrants than any of Pew\u2019s groups. And they\u2019re pretty solidly Democratic in their voting, despite their social and religious conservatism. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m nearly as far to the left as your average F&F leftist, certainly not in my voting, but in general, I\u2019m closer to them than to any other group.\n\nIn the wake of Hobby Lobby, a group of Faith & Family Left leaders are appealing to the president for religious exemptions in his forthcoming executive order banning discrimination against gays and lesbians in federal contracting. From The Atlantic\u2018s report:\n\nThe Hobby Lobby decision has been welcomed by religious-right groups who accuse Obama of waging a war on religion. But Tuesday\u2019s letter is different: It comes from a group of faith leaders who are generally friendly to the administration, many of whom have closely advised the White House on issues like immigration reform. The letter was organized by Michael Wear, who worked in the Obama White House and directed faith outreach for the president\u2019s 2012 campaign. Signers include two members of Catholics for Obama and three former members of the President\u2019s Advisory Council on Faith-Based and Neighborhood Partnerships. \u201cThis is not an antagonistic letter by any means,\u201d Wear told me. But in the wake of Hobby Lobby, he said, \u201cthe administration does have a decision to make whether they want to recalibrate their approach to some of these issues.\u201d\n\nMore:\n\n\u201cIt would be nice if we had just a little bit more leverage,\u201d said Schneck, a onetime cochair of Catholics for Obama. \u201cI am a very strong supporter of LGBT rights, and I am really excited about the prospect of extending provisions against discrimination in federal contracts. But I am also aware that this is an issue that provokes real differences among some of the most important religious organization on the front lines of providing care for the poorest and most vulnerable.\u201d Those groups, he said, need to be allowed to work with the government while following the dictates of their faith.\n\nThe letter to Obama, which you can read in the Atlantic article, makes a case based on tolerance and religious diversity. The question here is if the administration cares so much about gay rights that it\u2019s willing to push to the side religious organizations that serve the poor. As the authors of the letter say:\n\nOur concern about an executive order without a religious exemption is about more than the direct financial impact on religious organizations. While the nation has undergone incredible social and legal change over the last decade, we still live in a nation with different beliefs about sexuality. We must find a way to respect diversity of opinion on this issue in a way that respects the dignity of all parties to the best of our ability. There is no perfect solution that will make all parties completely happy.\n\nWe will see very soon whether the president has any regard for religious Democrats, or whether he\u2019s in the pocket of his gay-rights supporters.\n\nI wonder how Jonathan Rauch, who has been one of the wiser and more generous people on the gay rights side, would advise Obama to respond. Six days ago, he wrote about the hard battle lines between secularists and religionists. Excerpt:\n\nFinally, a new generation brought changed attitudes. Ed Whelan, the president of the culturally conservative Ethics and Public Policy Center in Washington, D.C., and a Catholic, told me, \u201cThose of us growing up in the 1960s and 1970s grew up with an assimilationist ethic: there was assumed to be little or no tension in being a Catholic in the broader American culture. Today, those of us who are parents see conflict all over the place. And we strive to be Catholics throughout our lives. As the culture has become less hospitable to religious beliefs, there is a greater need to be more vigilant. We\u2019ve got to figure out where to draw the lines.\u201d So a lot of line-drawing is going on. Even dog-walkers are drawing lines. I must sadly acknowledge that there is an absolutist streak among some secular civil-rights advocates. They think, justifiably, that discrimination is wrong and should not be tolerated, but they are too quick to overlook the unique role religion plays in American life and the unique protections it enjoys under the First Amendment. As a matter of both political wisdom and constitutional doctrine, the faithful have every right to seek reasonable accommodations for religious conscience. The problem is that what the social secessionists are asking for does not seem all that reasonable, especially to young Americans. When Christian businesses boycott gay weddings and pride celebrations, and when they lobby and sue for the right to do so, they may think they are sending the message \u201cJust leave us alone.\u201d But the message that mainstream Americans, especially young Americans, receive is very different. They hear: \u201cWhat we, the faithful, really want is to discriminate. Against gays. Maybe against you or people you hold dear. Heck, against your dog.\u201d I wonder whether religious advocates of these opt-outs have thought through the implications. Associating Christianity with a desire\u2014no, a determination\u2014to discriminate puts the faithful in open conflict with the value that young Americans hold most sacred. They might as well write off the next two or three or 10 generations, among whom nondiscrimination is the 11th commandment.\n\nIf that\u2019s how it has to be, that\u2019s how it has to be. Fidelity to what one believes to be religious and moral truth is more important than popularity. We live in a post-Christian society. It\u2019s going to get much worse for non-conforming Christians before it gets better. How Obama responds to this letter will be a critical bellwether.\n\nUPDATE: E.J. Dionne, a liberal Catholic, writes about this kind of thing in his latest column.
