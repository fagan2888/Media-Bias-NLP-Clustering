Toy Brick Art, on display through September.\n\n\u201cAlthough I\u2019ve built kachina dolls with LEGOs before, they received mixed feedback in Hopi villages,\u201d Shaddix says. \u201cBut this show was the first time I had a chance to convert a living artist\u2019s work, taking his vision and medium and transforming it into something completely new, a 70-by 80-inch toy brick mosaic. I redrew original weaving, pixel by pixel, on my computer, creating over 50 ten-inch sections, which were ultimately assembled by 60 awesome volunteers who turned the concept into a creation. Something this size would typically take me a month to build alone, but the volunteers built it in three hours. I had a blast watching the textile artist react, and interact, with the LEGO-ized version.\u201d\n\nRELATED: A Navajo Tapestry Made of Angry Birds and 57,000 Lego Bricks", "article_metadata": {"description": "Our Big Picture this week features a Navajo tapestry of Angry Birds made entirely of LEGOs, yes the plastic ones you played with as a kid.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/gallery/photo/photo-navajo-tapestry-featuring-angry-birds-and-57000-lego-bricks-155898", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "type": "article", "title": "Photo: A Navajo Tapestry Featuring Angry Birds and 57,000 LEGO Bricks"}, "abstract": "Our Big Picture this week features a Navajo tapestry of Angry Birds made entirely of LEGOs, yes the plastic ones you played with as a kid.", "dc": {"title": "Photo: A Navajo Tapestry Featuring Angry Birds and 57,000 LEGO Bricks"}, "robots": "follow, index", "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/gallery/photo/photo-navajo-tapestry-featuring-angry-birds-and-57000-lego-bricks-155898", "dcterms.creator": "leeanne", "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Angry Birds, LEGO, Marlowe Katoney, Heard Museum, Navajo, Native artists", "validation_code": "d9d37d7b776cc351c4025ded3df21cad", "dcterms.date": "2014-07-18T15:00-04:00", "sioc": {"num_replies": 0}, "dcterms.title": "Photo: A Navajo Tapestry Featuring Angry Birds and 57,000 LEGO Bricks"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1eb3\"", "article_summary": "I had a blast watching the textile artist react, and interact, with the LEGO-ized version.\u201dRELATED: A Navajo Tapestry Made of Angry Birds and 57,000 Lego Bricks\nBy: ICTMN StaffThis week\u2019s Big Picture features a tapestry that combines American Indian and LEGO brick art.\nSomething this size would typically take me a month to build alone, but the volunteers built it in three hours.\nToy Brick Art, on display through September.\n\u201cBut this show was the first time I had a chance to convert a living artist\u2019s work, taking his vision and medium and transforming it into something completely new, a 70-by 80-inch toy brick mosaic."}
