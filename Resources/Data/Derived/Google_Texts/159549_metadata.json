However, total organic revenue, which excludes the impact of currency movements, acquisitions and divestitures, rose 2 percent.\n\nThe net income attributable to shareholders fell 4.5 percent to $1.48 billion, or 34 cents per share.\n\nExcluding items, Coke earned 45 cents per share, beating the average analyst estimate by a cent, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\n\nCoke maintained its 2016 forecast of 4-5 percent growth in organic revenue and 4-6 percent growth in earnings per share on a constant-currency basis.\n\n(This story corrects paragraph 7 to say volumes in Asia Pacific increased as the company sold more lower-margin products, and not after the company sharply cut prices)\n\n(Reporting by Yashaswini Swamynathan in Bengaluru; Editing by Kirti Pandey)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "(Reuters) - Coca-Cola Co's sales fell for the fourth straight quarter as demand weaken", "title": "Weak Europe demand, strong dollar take fizz out of Coke's sales", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/04/20/Coca-Cola-quarterly-sales-fall-4-percent", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/britain-budget-sugar_2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/04/20/Coca-Cola-quarterly-sales-fall-4-percent", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/britain-budget-sugar_2.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "(Reuters) - Coca-Cola Co's sales fell for the fourth straight quarter as demand weaken", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "All cans and bottles of its Coca-Cola branded sodas will have a similar appearance, prominently featuring the red color associated with regular Coke, but sporting a band of the color that distinguishes Diet Coke, Coke Zero and Coke Life.\nSales in Asia Pacific, including China, dropped 4 percent, but volumes increased as the company sold more lower-margin products.\nCoke's sales in Europe, its third biggest market, declined 1 percent in the quarter ended April 1, while Latin America sales plunged 12.2 percent.\nThe rise in the dollar has also hit the companies, which have a sizeable presence in markets outside the United States, including China and Brazil.\n(Reuters) - Coca-Cola Co's sales fell for the fourth straight quarter as demand weakened for its fizzy drinks in Europe and a strong dollar ate into revenue from other markets outside the United States, including Latin America."}
