But if you\u2019re an expat living abroad and haven\u2019t filed, there\u2019s no need to panic \u2014 yet. U.S. taxpayers living abroad get an automatic extension filing their taxes until June 15.\n\nJust be sure the return indicates that you live outside the United States, said James Brohl, a U.S. accountant who has been living and practicing in Costa Rica for 11 years.\n\nPaying taxes can be confusing and frustrating for people living stateside. But it\u2019s even more arcane for those who live abroad. The Tico Times spoke with Brohl about some of the most frequent questions U.S. expats have about filing their tax returns for Uncle Sam.\n\nDo I need to file taxes if I live and work outside the United States?\n\nYes. The United States is one of the only countries in the world that taxes its citizens and residents (green card holders) on their worldwide income. This has led some in recent years to renounce their U.S. citizenship to avoid the tax burden.\n\nU.S. residents and citizens must file taxes but filing does not necessarily mean someone has to pay taxes.\n\nOK, so how much money do I have to make abroad before I start paying taxes?\n\nAnyone who made more than the standard deduction plus exemptions on their return \u2014 $10,150 for a single person in 2014 \u2014 needs to file taxes.\n\nForeign earnings up to $99,200 in 2014 are excluded from U.S. income tax.\n\nBrohl noted that these rules apply regardless of whether foreign earnings are deposited in the United States or elsewhere.\n\nWhat about Obamacare? Do I need to pay a fine if I don\u2019t have insurance in the US?\n\nNo. As long as you have moved your tax home outside the United States, you do not have to pay the \u201cindividual shared responsibility\u201d fee required by the Affordable Care Act for those U.S. residents/citizens without qualifying health care coverage. Expats do need to file a form with their taxes to claim this exemption.\n\nIf you\u2019re covered under a U.S. government plan like Medicare, you do not need to file the exemption even if you live abroad.\n\nWhat is an FBAR?\n\nThe FBAR, Report of Foreign Bank and Financial Accounts, is not related to U.S. taxes. Instead, this is a form that needs to be filed if you have more than $10,000 in foreign financial accounts.\n\nThis must be filed if you, at any time during the last year, had a highest daily balance of more than $10,000 cumulative in your foreign accounts. This includes accounts where the taxpayer has only signatory authorization, as well as brokerage accounts, mutual funds, trusts, or other type of foreign financial accounts.\n\nAdd the highest daily balances for each of these foreign accounts. If the accumulated amount is greater than $10,000, an FBAR must be filed online for that year by June 30.\n\nCheck out this previously published Tico Times piece from U.S. accountant Ross Lustman about the FBAR for additional details.\n\nThis is, of course, far from an exhaustive list of potential questions about expat taxes. Brohl recommends consulting an accountant familiar with the U.S. tax code for further questions.\n\n\u201cThere are no simple situations when foreign financial assets are involved,\u201d Brohl said in an email to The Tico Times. \u201cIt is best to do the research to make sure you are filing properly.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The FBAR, Report of Foreign Bank and Financial Accounts, has to be filed if you have more than $10,000 in foreign financial accounts.", "og": {"site_name": "The Tico Times", "description": "The FBAR, Report of Foreign Bank and Financial Accounts, has to be filed if you have more than $10,000 in foreign financial accounts.", "title": "US taxes are due April 15, are you ready?", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://www.ticotimes.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/150412IRSTaxes-1000x665.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-04-14T12:36:39-06:00", "url": "http://www.ticotimes.net/2015/04/13/us-taxes-are-due-april-15-are-you-ready", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "ticotimes.net", "description": "The FBAR, Report of Foreign Bank and Financial Accounts, has to be filed if you have more than $10,000 in foreign financial accounts.", "creator": "@zkdyer", "url": "http://www.ticotimes.net/2015/04/13/us-taxes-are-due-april-15-are-you-ready", "image": {"src": "http://www.ticotimes.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/150412IRSTaxes-1000x665.jpg", "identifier": "http://www.ticotimes.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/150412IRSTaxes.jpg"}, "title": "US taxes are due April 15, are you ready?", "site": "@theticotimes", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"admins": "pupstar"}, "article": {"section": "Business", "tag": "Taxes", "published_time": "2015-04-13T12:47:59-06:00", "modified_time": "2015-04-14T12:36:39-06:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fceb2f\"", "article_summary": "U.S. residents and citizens must file taxes but filing does not necessarily mean someone has to pay taxes.\nAnyone who made more than the standard deduction plus exemptions on their return \u2014 $10,150 for a single person in 2014 \u2014 needs to file taxes.\nDo I need to file taxes if I live and work outside the United States?\nThe United States is one of the only countries in the world that taxes its citizens and residents (green card holders) on their worldwide income.\n\u201cThere are no simple situations when foreign financial assets are involved,\u201d Brohl said in an email to The Tico Times."}
