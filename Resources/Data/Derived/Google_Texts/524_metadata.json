Republicans can\u2019t start their war without votes from Democrats\u2026 Experts agree that without this agreement, we could face a new war in the Middle East. We have 60 days to defend diplomacy and stop a war. Find a town hall event with your member of Congress, and let them know you want diplomacy, not war.\n\nSome of the members of Congress targeted by the 60 Days effort, such as Rep. Doug LaMalfa (R-CA), are likely opponents of the Iran deal. The goal of the campaign is to create media attention, not to switch votes.\n\nA list of the events, in chronological order, follows.
