It\u2019s a run that included them knocking off second-seeded Virginia last weekend and third-seeded Oklahoma in the regional semifinal on Friday.\n\nMichigan State advances to face the winner of the South Regional final between Duke and Gonzaga.\n\nWayne Blackshear had 28 points for the Cardinals (27-9) in a game that featured 11 lead changes.\n\nIt\u2019s the ninth Final Four appearance for the Spartans, and first since 2010, when they lost 52-50 to Butler in the national semifinals. Izzo has led them to seven Final Fours including the 2000 national championship.\n\nThe Spartans did it with perseverance and with a roster that was regarded as having less talent than the team that lost in the regional final to Connecticut a year ago. Michigan State lost three of its top four scorers.\n\nTrice was so elated and drained following the victory that he fell to his knees at center court and began sobbing. He was joined by his teammates and members of his family.\n\nThe Spartans rallied from a 40-32 halftime deficit to eventually build a 61-59 lead with 3:57 left, when Trice hit two free throws.\n\nThe Cardinals rallied and had a chance to pull out the victory in regulation. Down 65-64, Mangok Mathiang hit one of two free throws with 4.9 seconds left.\n\nMichigan State took control in overtime, starting with Bryn Forbes hitting a 3-pointer 26 seconds in.\n\nThe Spartans then sealed it in the final 31 seconds. Branden Dawson did what Izzo\u2019s teams have done well over the years: He put back a 3-point miss by Forbes to put Michigan State up 74-70.\n\nSpartans forward Denzel Valentine then batted away a pass on the Cardinals\u2019 next possession, and Trice sealed the win by hitting two free throws with 10.1 seconds left.\n\nMichigan State\u2019s defense \u2014 Izzo\u2019s other trademark \u2014 played havoc with the Cardinals. After hitting 17 of 32 attempts in the first half, Louisville managed to make six of its final 32.\n\nIt is the third straight year one conference has had two teams in the Final Four. The Southeastern Conference did last year with Kentucky and Florida and the Big East had Louisville and Syracuse in 2013.\n\nThe last time the Big Ten did it was 2005 with Michigan State and Illinois.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Michigan State headed to Final Four after OT win over Louisville", "title": "Michigan State headed to Final Four after OT win over Louisville", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/03/29/michigan-state-headed-to-final-four-after-ot-win-over-louisville/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150329__michigan-statep1.jpg", "height": 436}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150329__michigan-statep1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2015-03-29T15:10:56+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-25T20:08:38+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf394\"", "article_summary": "SYRACUSE, N.Y. \u2014 Coach Tom Izzo and the Michigan State Spartans capped an improbable run to the Final Four with an overtime win.\nMichigan State advances to face the winner of the South Regional final between Duke and Gonzaga.\nThe last time the Big Ten did it was 2005 with Michigan State and Illinois.\nBranden Dawson did what Izzo\u2019s teams have done well over the years: He put back a 3-point miss by Forbes to put Michigan State up 74-70.\nMichigan State lost three of its top four scorers."}
