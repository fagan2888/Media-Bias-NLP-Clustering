Traffic is back to normal on I-26 in the area of the I-95 interchange following an accident that had eastbound traffic at a crawl Monday afternoon.



Authorities say the accident happened in the area of mile marker 170 in Dorchester County at 4:10 p.m.

Officials with the South Carolina Highway Patrol say it all started when a Jeep Liberty pulling a camper ran off the side of the road. Highway patrol says the camper then began to sway causing it to jack knife and unhitch from the Jeep.

At that point, authorities say the driver lost control of the Jeep which flipped on its roof and landed on the highway.

Highway patrol officials say the driver and passenger of the Jeep were wearing seatbelts and were not transported to the hospital.



The South Carolina Highway Patrol and the Harleyville Fire Department responded to the scene.
