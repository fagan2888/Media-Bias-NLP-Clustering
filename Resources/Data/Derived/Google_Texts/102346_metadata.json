But he should really set the example by speaking English while in the United States.\u201d\n\nBush often speaks Spanish when interacting with Latino voters \u2013 his wife is originally from Mexico, and Bush is a fluent speaker. Trump may have been referring to an offhand comment Bush made to reporters on Tuesday, in which, he said of Trump, \u201cel hombre no es conservador.\u201d That translates roughly as \u201cthe man is not conservative.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s comments continued a battle of words between the real estate billionaire who has upended the Republican presidential primary campaign, and Bush, who more than anyone carries the mantle of the establishment Republicans in the race.\n\nOn Monday, Trump released a video on Instagram in which he ridiculed Bush\u2019s much-quoted statement that sometimes illegal immigration to the U.S. is an \u201cact of love\u201d done to make a better life for family members.\n\n\u201cForget Love, it\u2019s time to get tough,\u201d the Trump video proclaimed, as it interspersed pictures of illegal immigrants charged with murder with clips of Bush defending the motives of illegal immigrants.\n\nRelated: Iowa Caucuses Could Be a Bloodbath for GOP\n\nOn Tuesday, the Bush campaign released a video ad called \u201cThe Real Donald Trump\u201d that blasted the current frontrunner in the polls for his history of taking positions other than those he advocates now \u2013 positions often associated more with Democrats than with Republicans.\n\nTrump hit right back, with another video showing Bush praising Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton for her public service, and Bush\u2019s older brother, President George W. Bush saying that she is like \u201ca sister-in-law\u201d to the Bush family.\n\nThen, the Bush campaign went up with a Buzzfeed-like \u201cWhich Candidate Are You?\u201d quiz meant to highlight the differences between Bush and Trump. It even went after Trump for being a \u201cgermophobe\u201d who doesn\u2019t like to shake hands.\n\nThe food-fight quality of the exchanges between the two candidates is setting up a potentially tense scene when the top tier of Republican candidates gather in California two weeks from now for the second GOP presidential primary debate.\n\nIf the conventions for arranging the stage remain the same, Trump will again be in the center, and Bush will have to occupy a podium right next to him. At the rate they\u2019re going, both candidates might show up for the contest armed with rotten fruit ready for throwing.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Donald Trump\u2019s attacks on immigrants haven\u2019t gone so far as to propose making it illegal to speak Spanish in the U.S., but in an attack on Jeb Bush during an interview with a right-wing website, he made it plain that he doesn\u2019t believe U.S. Presidential candidates ought to be speaking any language other than English.", "title": "Trump Rips Bush for Speaking Spanish, Bush Calls Trump a \u2018Germophobe\u2019", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/09/02/Trump-Rips-Bush-Speaking-Spanish-Bush-Calls-Trump-Germophobe", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/donald_trump_jeb_bush_split.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/09/02/Trump-Rips-Bush-Speaking-Spanish-Bush-Calls-Trump-Germophobe", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/donald_trump_jeb_bush_split.jpg", "creator": "@rrgarver", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Donald Trump\u2019s attacks on immigrants haven\u2019t gone so far as to propose making it illegal to speak Spanish in the U.S., but in an attack on Jeb Bush during an interview with a right-wing website, he made it plain that he doesn\u2019t believe U.S. Presidential candidates ought to be speaking any language other than English.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0493\"", "article_summary": "Then, the Bush campaign went up with a Buzzfeed-like \u201cWhich Candidate Are You?\u201d quiz meant to highlight the differences between Bush and Trump.\nIt even went after Trump for being a \u201cgermophobe\u201d who doesn\u2019t like to shake hands.\nBut in an attack on Jeb Bush during an interview with a right-wing website, Trump made it clear that he doesn\u2019t believe U.S. Presidential candidates ought to be speaking any language other than English.\nDonald Trump\u2019s attacks on immigrants haven\u2019t gone so far as to propose making it illegal to speak Spanish in the U.S.\n\u201cForget Love, it\u2019s time to get tough,\u201d the Trump video proclaimed, as it interspersed pictures of illegal immigrants charged with murder with clips of Bush defending the motives of illegal immigrants."}
