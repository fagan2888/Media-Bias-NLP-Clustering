So many people work terribly hard, and nobody sees them do it.\u201d\n\nAs a child, Ms. Arcone would stand behind her mother, a skilled baker, in the kitchen. \u201cI was waiting to lick the spoon,\u201d she said.\n\nIt was just the two of them. Her mother, a school secretary, raised her on the Lower East Side of Manhattan. Her father, with whom she had little contact, died when she was 13.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOne Sunday morning, Ms. Arcone, then a senior at Stuyvesant, went into her mother\u2019s room before leaving to do volunteer work. Her mother had died in the night after a heart attack.\n\n\u201cI called the police,\u201d Ms. Arcone said. \u201cI was terrified.\u201d She was 17.\n\n\u201cMy mother had named good family friends as my guardians,\u201d she continued. \u201cI moved in with them. But it just was not a good fit.\u201d\n\nShe went to Cornell but couldn\u2019t find her footing. She did, however, discover that she loved to bake. \u201cI wanted to make the things my mother had made \u2014 her brownies and oatmeal cookies,\u201d she said.\n\nLeaving college after three years, she enrolled at the New York Restaurant School in Manhattan and later found work catering. But over the years, she had a couple of setbacks. In 1991, she fell and broke her wrist. She was without health insurance, and the hospital and surgery bills \u201cwiped out what savings I had,\u201d she said.\n\nFive years later, while cooking at the Cub Room in SoHo, her feet gave out. \u201cOne day I finished work,\u201d Ms. Arcone said, \u201cwent out to have breakfast, and when I got up, I couldn\u2019t walk.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nShe didn\u2019t have money to see a doctor. (Months later, she was given a diagnosis of metatarsalgia, an inflammation in the ball of the foot.) Unable to work, she couldn\u2019t pay the rent. And she felt ashamed to ask for help. \u201cYour vision narrows,\u201d she said. \u201cI kept thinking, \u2018If I can just make it through the day.\u2019\u201d\n\nFearing she would be evicted from her Brooklyn sublet, she gave away her beloved orange cat.\n\nThen, one night that November, she came back from the store. \u201cThey\u2019d drilled out the lock,\u201d she said, referring to the landlord.\n\nThrough the fall, she slept on the A train. She showered at the Russian & Turkish Baths in the East Village. By the end of December Ms. Arcone was \u201c completely desperate,\u201d she said, and called a high school friend who was a lawyer. \u201cHe said, \u2018I\u2019m not even going to send you to the city shelters,\u2019\u201d Ms. Arcone recounted. \u201c\u2018You wouldn\u2019t survive.\u2019\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cHe sent me to Sister Nancy,\u201d she explained. \u201cThere was this relief: I was inside. I was warm. And I had a place to sleep.\u201d\n\nShe became a customer at the Cupcake Cafe in 2008, and in 2011, Ms. Warren, an owner, asked if she would like to do some baking for the shop.\n\nThe cafe first opened in 1988, on the corner of 39th Street and Ninth Avenue, and reflected the freewheeling character of Hell\u2019s Kitchen in those days.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not business people,\u201d said Michael Warren, 66, who owned the cafe with Ms. Warren, a painter. The couple divorced in 2010, but both remained with the cafe.\n\nThe cafe featured doughnuts, as well as cakes and cupcakes decorated with Monet-like flowers by Ms. Warren and her staff, and became a neighborhood hub. \u201cMike\u2019s rule was: If anybody\u2019s hungry, they can get a doughnut and a coffee,\u201d said Adelaide Morro, 61, a longtime employee, referring to Mr. Warren\u2019s generosity.\n\nA glowing review in The New York Times brought in those farther afield. The musician David Byrne and the actress Sarah Jessica Parker were among its customers. But after the 1990s, there were financial struggles. Opening in 2004, the cafe on West 40th Street had a smaller following. Two years later, the original location closed. In 2005, the couple opened a cafe in Books of Wonder, a children\u2019s bookstore on West 18th Street; that cafe closed six years later.\n\nYet the cafe on West 40th remained a haven for its regulars. The room was strung with paper lanterns. A few regulars stored their groceries there in an antique icebox.\n\nMs. Arcone is alert to every change on Ninth Avenue: The Turkish restaurant on 39th Street \u201cgot shut down by the health department,\u201d she said, heading out from the Cupcake Cafe on a frigid night in February. She needed ingredients for tomato soup. \u201cThe owners just walked away. Then the pipes froze and burst.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cIf it was us,\u201d she added, \u201cwe would have cleaned till everything was right.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s with the pajamas?\u201d she said, as she passed a young man wearing pajamas with a Nordic design.\n\nAt Terra, a market on Ninth Avenue, she navigated the narrow aisles. There were bundles of bruised oranges and carrots for a dollar. And also fresh asparagus for $1.99.\n\nPhoto\n\nShe paused by the Persian cucumbers: \u201cHave you had these?\u201d I love them!\u201d Then she grabbed two bunches of dill, scallions and a pint of cream for her soup. She would cook it at 3 a.m. at the Dwelling Place.\n\nAt midnight, Ms. Arcone, who is not quite five feet tall, settled into her spot: a table in the residence\u2019s dining room. Behind her was a painting of a young woman lighting Sabbath candles. Ms. Arcone, who is Jewish, likes the painting. \u201cIt\u2019s been here as long as I have,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI like being here alone,\u201d she added. \u201cI know what I have to do at night. It doesn\u2019t matter in what order, or when I do it.\u201d\n\nUpstairs, 15 women were asleep. Lights must be turned off at 10:30 p.m. \u201cI can think of eight I know that I\u2019ve talked to,\u201d she said.\n\nLike some of the women who have stayed there, Ms. Arcone has struggled with depression. It hit after her mother died. \u201cWe didn\u2019t know the word then,\u201d she said. \u201cNow doctors would have prescribed an antidepressant.\u201d\n\nHer 30s and 40s were tough.\n\n\u201cSo much of it I spent feeling I was not any good,\u201d she said. \u201cAt having a successful career, at getting married.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cBut oh, my God,\u201d she continued, smiling. \u201cSomewhere between 50 and 60, things change. I\u2019ve accepted I\u2019m never going to be president, or White House pastry chef, or whatever.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut I\u2019m doing what I like,\u201d she added. \u201cI\u2019m taking care of myself. And I\u2019ve got things under control.\u201d\n\nTwo weeks before Easter, Ms. Arcone and Ms. Warren met at Cull & Pistol Oyster Bar in Chelsea Market for the dollar-an-oyster special. It was a late birthday celebration for Ms. Arcone.\n\nIt was a rare break. The two friends were giddy.\n\n\u201cI have a fantasy,\u201d Ms. Warren said, looking out at the popular food marketplace, \u201cof having the Cupcake Cafe here.\u201d Part of the fantasy is that she could \u201cdrift into Cull & Pistol.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no money to do it,\u201d she added. \u201cBut I can dream.\u201d\n\nA waiter steered a platter of oysters toward them. Ms. Arcone closed her eyes as she ate her first.\n\nHer thoughts turned to her 60th birthday, two years away. \u201cI really want to see the Northern Lights,\u201d she said. \u201cThe cheap way is to go to Iceland. The expensive way would be the Norway Coastal Voyage.\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe we could apply for a kitchen job on a cruise ship,\u201d Ms. Warren said. \u201cWe\u2019d see nothing!\u201d\n\nNew York Today Sign up to receive the latest on New York events, arts, sports, dining, style and more, delivered to your inbox every morning.\n\nA week later, Ms. Arcone opened the door to her room at Geffner House for a reporter.\n\nThe walls were bare. But evidence of her passion was everywhere: There were hundreds of cookbooks in bookcases, stacked neatly on the radiator and filling bags.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nA window looked north toward the Hearst Tower. \u201cOn the left you can see a bit of water,\u201d Ms. Arcone said. \u201cSometimes you can see ships pull out and you can hear the horns.\u201d\n\nTaped to the door was The Daily News\u2019s front page with the headline \u201cI\u2019m With Stupid!\u201d featuring the Republican presidential candidate Donald J. Trump with Sarah Palin; a fan letter left by a customer; and a picture of a black cat.\n\nMs. Arcone loves cats: Her one complaint about Geffner House is that no pets are allowed. \u201cEverybody knows having a cat is a healthy thing,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s good for blood pressure, for loneliness.\u201d\n\nShe is matter-of-fact about other aspects of the residence. \u201cIt\u2019s noisy,\u201d she said, noting that there was jackhammering during the day from a renovation. \u201cThere\u2019s loan-sharking going on, drug dealing,\u201d she added. \u201cYou\u2019re riding the elevator with people so stoned they don\u2019t know what floor they\u2019re going to.\u201d\n\nYet she said, \u201cI don\u2019t feel unsafe.\u201d\n\nSo why does she stay? Ms. Arcone pays only $698 rent. She might be able to find a room in an apartment somewhere, but she said, \u201cI don\u2019t want to share.\u201d Besides, she added: \u201cMy longest commute to my two jobs is three blocks. You can\u2019t beat that.\u201d\n\nMs. Warren told her staff five days before Easter that she had filed for bankruptcy and had to close the cafe.\n\nTalking about it later, she sounded relieved. \u201cIt\u2019s the neighborhood living room,\u201d she said about her business, \u201cbut the neighborhood living room is not a business.\u201d\n\nShe said she felt terrible for her staff, and especially for Ms. Arcone. \u201cRuth has been such a peach,\u201d she said. Ms. Warren had been talking with her and other staff members about possible projects, maybe a pop-up. Maybe she would even reopen. But for now, everything was in limbo.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe cafe\u2019s last day was Easter Sunday. Baby\u2019s breath filled a vase on the big table. Wheat doughnuts were set out. Regulars milled around the piano as Murray Weinstock, 67, played jazz.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re having a wake,\u201d Ms. Arcone said, sitting in her chair. She looked exhausted. \u201cIt\u2019s huge,\u201d she said of the closing. \u201cIt\u2019s not only losing the work, the money. But if you live in a room, you want to get out, find someplace where you can just sit.\u201d\n\nShe stood suddenly. \u201cMy cake plate!\u201d she said, and disappeared into the kitchen. Ms. Arcone came back, holding it. \u201cThis is mine,\u201d she said, and stashed it in her tote.\n\nThe young staff members stood at the back, stunned.\n\n\u201cI guess I\u2019m in denial,\u201d said Rebecca Chambers, 31, a cake decorator who had been hired there when she was 19. \u201cCupcake takes these tumultuous turns. It always lands on its feet.\u201d\n\nAt 4 p.m. Ms. Arcone said, \u201cI\u2019ll be right back!\u201d She had made an Easter cake for the women at the Dwelling Place and needed to take it over. They eat at 6 p.m. sharp. \u201cIt has a passion fruit curd filling,\u201d she said. \u201cRebecca iced it with coconut cream cheese.\u201d\n\nHurrying, she carried the unwrapped cake down West 40th Street toward 10th Avenue. Then, emerging from the shelter, she walked back to the cafe in the fading spring light.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "feature", "ptime": 20160507134041, "twitter": {"description": "A Stuyvesant and Cornell alumna who was once homeless found that she loved baking, but the Cupcake Cafe in Midtown, her employer and her haven, abruptly closed.", "title": "Striving for Her Piece of the Pie", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/08/nyregion/striving-for-her-piece-of-the-pie.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000004376500"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/05/08/nyregion/08RUTH1/08RUTH1-thumbLarge.jpg", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/08/nyregion/striving-for-her-piece-of-the-pie.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000004376500", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/08/nyregion/striving-for-her-piece-of-the-pie.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "thumbnail_width": 75, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "nyregion", "hdl_p": "The Pie Maker\u2019s Tale", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/nyregion/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "May 7, 2016", "edt": "NewYork", "article": {"section_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/section/nyregion", "section": "N.Y. / Region", "modified": "2016-05-12", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/nyregion/index.jsonp", "tag": "Small Business", "published": "2016-05-07", "section-taxonomy-id": "C4DC8C0C-E148-4201-BF10-82F1C903DBFB"}, "keywords": "Arcone  Ruth (1958- ),Homeless Persons,Cupcake Cafe,New York City,Public and Subsidized Housing,Small Business", "description": "A Stuyvesant and Cornell alumna who was once homeless found that she loved baking, but the Cupcake Cafe in Midtown, her employer and her haven, abruptly closed.", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "Susan Hartman", "thumbnail_150": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/05/08/nyregion/08RUTH1/08RUTH1-thumbLarge.jpg", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "per": "Arcone, Ruth (1958- )", "slug": "08ruth", "byl": "By SUSAN HARTMAN", "thumbnail_150_height": 150, "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "A Stuyvesant and Cornell alumna who was once homeless found that she loved baking, but the Cupcake Cafe in Midtown, her employer and her haven, abruptly closed.", "tom": "News", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "utime": 20160512020008, "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/05/08/nyregion/08RUTH1/08RUTH1-thumbStandard.jpg", "CN": "metropolitan-20160508", "CG": "nyregion", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "May 7, 2016", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "News", "org": "Cupcake Cafe", "thumbnail_height": 75, "geo": "New York City", "thumbnail_150_width": 150, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "CT": "issue", "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/08/nyregion/striving-for-her-piece-of-the-pie.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/05/08/nyregion/08RUTH1/08RUTH1-facebookJumbo.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "A Stuyvesant and Cornell alumna who was once homeless found that she loved baking, but the Cupcake Cafe in Midtown, her employer and her haven, abruptly closed.", "title": "Striving for Her Piece of the Pie"}, "pdate": 20160507, "des": "Small Business", "nyt-collection": {"tone": "feature", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/issue/nyregion/2016/05/08/metropolitan", "uri": "/issue/nyregion/2016/05/08/metropolitan", "display-name": "Metropolitan", "identifier": "metropolitan-20160508", "type": "issue"}, "articleid": 100000004376500, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "Striving for Her Piece of the Pie", "PST": "News"}, "article_summary": "The cafe, Ms. Arcone said, gave her a sense of community.\nAnd I\u2019ve got things under control.\u201dTwo weeks before Easter, Ms. Arcone and Ms. Warren met at Cull & Pistol Oyster Bar in Chelsea Market for the dollar-an-oyster special.\nBy the end of December Ms. Arcone was \u201c completely desperate,\u201d she said, and called a high school friend who was a lawyer.\n\u201cOne day I finished work,\u201d Ms. Arcone said, \u201cwent out to have breakfast, and when I got up, I couldn\u2019t walk.\u201dPhotoShe didn\u2019t have money to see a doctor.\n\u201cHe said, \u2018I\u2019m not even going to send you to the city shelters,\u2019\u201d Ms. Arcone recounted."}
