CHARLOTTE -- Uninsured people affected by federal penalties will have a second chance to sign up for 2015 coverage through the healthcare.gov website.

The Affordable Care Act requires everyone to have health insurance through an employer, a government program, or by buying individual policies.

A monetary fine is collected from those who do not sign up. 2015 is the first year fines are being collected.

H&R Block said the penalty hovers around $170 among its affected customers.

People have until April 30 to sign up for coverage in order to avoid larger fines in 2016.
