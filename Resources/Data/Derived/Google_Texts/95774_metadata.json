It found people on both sides of the political debate are wrong about some significant facts.\n\nVox concluded the biggest myth surrounds the expected cost of extending health insurance to tens of millions of Americans, with 42 percent of Americans believing Obamacare is costing more than expected.\n\nAs the Vox article by longtime health care writer Sarah Kliff details, the actual estimate by creditable sources including the Congressional Budget Office has dropped five times since 2010.\n\nYet the Vox survey found only five percent of Americans know the expected cost is less than originally estimated -- 20 percent less, according to the latest CBO estimate.\n\nAnother myth highlighted by Vox is that undocumented immigrants can get financial help toward coverage. The survey found 39 percent of Republicans and 14 percent of Democrats believe that is the case. In realty, undocumented immigrants can't get such help, and they aren't even allowed to buy coverage on the exchange with their own money.\n\nYet another persistent myth involves a goverment \"death panel\" making decisions about patients' end-of-life care. Vox found 26 percent of Republicans and 12 percent of Democrats believe in the existence of a death panel.\n\nKliff noted that PolitiFact, which conducts fact checks of political claims, called death panels the \"lie of the year\" in 2009.\n\nThis story's headline was updated.", "article_metadata": {"article_author": "David Wenner | dwenner@pennlive.com", "medium": "news", "news_keywords": "affordable care act,health care,obamacare", "title": "Many people believe Obamacare myths over facts, survey shows", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Many people believe Obamacare myths over facts, survey shows\", \"link\": \"http://www.pennlive.com/midstate/index.ssf/2015/03/obamacare_cost.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://imgick.pennlive.com/home/penn-media/width620/img/midstate_impact/photo/obamacare-artjpg-8202fbe163618bd6jpg-ee6d0c5947a1d927.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"15559561\", \"pub_date\": \"2015-03-25T15:18:16Z\", \"author\": \"David Wenner | dwenner@pennlive.com\", \"tags\": [\"@topmobile\",\"@topstories\",\"affordable care act\",\"health care\",\"obamacare\"] }", "twitter": {"site": "@pennlive", "image": "http://media.pennlive.com/midstate_impact/photo/13770616-thumb_square_large.jpg", "description": "It found people on both sides of the political debate are wrong about some significant facts.", "card": "summary", "creator": "@DavidRWenner"}, "article_date_updated": "Wednesday, March 25, 2015, 12:55 PM", "parsely-metadata": "{\"image_url\": \"http://media.pennlive.com/midstate_impact/photo/obamacare-artjpg-8202fbe163618bd6jpg-ee6d0c5947a1d927.jpg\", \"author_name\": \"dwenner\", \"author_nickname\": \"David Wenner | dwenner@pennlive.com\", \"author_id\": \"569\", \"source_blog_name\": \"Breaking News on PennLive\", \"source_blog_url\": \"http://www.pennlive.com/midstate/index.ssf/\", \"sponsored_content\": \"0\" }", "og": {"site_name": "PennLive.com", "description": "It found people on both sides of the political debate are wrong about some significant facts.", "title": "Many people believe Obamacare myths over facts, survey shows", "url": "http://www.pennlive.com/midstate/index.ssf/2015/03/obamacare_cost.html", "image": "http://media.pennlive.com/design/alpha/img/logo_penn.gif", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "PennLive.com", "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Wednesday, March 25, 2015, 11:18 AM", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "Description": "It found people on both sides of the political debate are wrong about some significant facts."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdfa4d\"", "article_summary": "A survey conducted for the online publication Vox focused on the biggest \"myths\" surrounding the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare.\nYet the Vox survey found only five percent of Americans know the expected cost is less than originally estimated -- 20 percent less, according to the latest CBO estimate.\nThe survey found 39 percent of Republicans and 14 percent of Democrats believe that is the case.\nVox found 26 percent of Republicans and 12 percent of Democrats believe in the existence of a death panel.\nIt found people on both sides of the political debate are wrong about some significant facts."}
