STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - One adult and four students were injured after being attacked by a masked man with a sword at a school in western Sweden, the police said in a statement on Thursday.

The suspect was later shot, police said. His condition was unclear. The incident occurred at the Kronan school in Trollhattan, an industrial town of around 50,000 inhabitants north of Gothenburg.

Police responded to an emergency call saying a masked man equipped with a sword was on the premises and that a person had been attacked at or near the school cafeteria, police said.

"Shortly after this we received information that the assailant had been shot by police and that his condition was not known," the police said on its website.

The police dispatch was also informed a further four students had been injured by the assailant.

"We have received one person ... very seriously injured." said Niklas Claesson, head of communication at NAL hospital in Trollhattan.
