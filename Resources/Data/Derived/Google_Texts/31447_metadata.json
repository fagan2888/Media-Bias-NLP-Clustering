Mr. Shannon has never headed a major campaign before.\n\nThat\u2019s one of several shakeups within the beleaguered campaign expected to continue through the end of the week.\n\nVeteran Democratic campaign consultants Aaron Pickrell and Louis Capobianco have also left the campaign.\n\nCampaign spokeswoman Lauren Hitt said it would be inaccurate to present the changes as a sign that key campaign workers are abandoning ship.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s clear that the reasons the campaign is making these changes are because, in order to win, we have to address challenges in fund-raising and negative press,\u201d she said. \u201cIf everything was going according to the plan, we wouldn\u2019t be changing things.\u201d\n\nThe campaign plans to announce the results of its staffing shakeup on Friday. Ms. Hitt would not say whether she would be among the changes announced or whether communications director Daniel McElhatton is also out.\n\nMs. Hitt said it\u2019s not true that the changes are being made because the campaign can\u2019t afford the staffing it has.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no question we can afford them,\u201d she said. \u201cThe question is what\u2019s the best use of our resources.\u201d\n\nThe campaign has struggled to gain momentum after early stumbles, including having to replace Mr. FitzGerald\u2019s first lieutenant governor pick because of questions over unpaid business and personal taxes.\n\nRepublican Gov. John Kasich has nearly a 5-to-1 cash-on-hand advantage, $11.4 million to $2.4 million, over Mr. FitzGerald as of July and is getting major help on top of that from the Republican Governors Association. No deep-pocketed counterpart has come to fund similar ads on Mr. FitzGerald\u2019s behalf.\n\nThe RGA began airing its latest TV ad this week in support of Mr. Kasich, consisting entirely of media reports on the fact that Mr. FitzGerald drove for years without a permanent drivers\u2019 license. The emphasis is on the \u201cshady\u201d in the ad.\n\nThe revelation about Mr. FitzGerald\u2019s lack of a permanent driver\u2019s license for nearly a decade followed the release of a Westlake police report that Mr. FitzGerald was found in a car alone with a woman who was not his wife while parked in an industrial complex parking lot in the early hours of an October 2012 morning.\n\nThe police officer reported they were \u201cjust talking.\u201d Mr. FitzGerald has said nothing improper occurred, and the woman with him, Joanne Grehan, a member of an Irish delegation visiting the county, issued a statement that the situation was \u201cinnocuous.\u201d\n\nAll of this piled on a campaign that was already having difficulty raising the kind of money needed to mount the a TV presence to defeat a well-financed incumbent and effectively make its case that Mr. Kasich\u2019s policies benefit the wealthy at the expense of middle-class and lower-income Ohioans.\n\nLarry Sabato, director of the University of Virginia\u2019s Center for Politics, has had the governor\u2019s race at \u201clikely R\u201d in the center\u2019s Crystal Ball predictions for gubernatorial races across the nation for some time.\n\n\u201cFor all practical purposes, we\u2019ve put Ohio\u2019s governor\u2019s race to bed,\u201d he said. \u201cIf something big happens, we\u2019ll obviously go back to it. \u2026The lines have been drawn, and a kindergartner could color in the likely results at this point.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the failure of the FitzGerald campaign as much as it the success of Kasich,\u201d Mr. Sabato said. \u201c(Mr. Kasich) still has rough edges. But Ohio is highly competitive and tends to reflect the national mood of any given year. Right now the mood is leans-Republican. I don\u2019t see a Republican wave. ..That may develop in late September or October, but it\u2019s not there yet. If things continue on the current track, this could be a safe Republican race.\u201d\n\nAnd that was before the internal shake-up within the FitzGerald campaign.\n\nAmong other things, Mr. Shannon was previously deputy director for President Obama\u2019s 2012 re-election campaign in Ohio and worked on the We Are Ohio campaign that led to the 2011 voter rejection of the Senate Bill 5 restrictions on collective bargaining signed by Mr. Kasich.\n\nMr. Shannon is from Mt. Sterling, Ohio. Ms. Hitt said she doesn\u2019t \u201cbuy into\u201d the assessment of some that the campaign had filled its ranks with out-of-state staffers, including herself.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.thumb": "http://www.toledoblade.com/image/2014/08/19/75x_b1_a4-4_cC_z_ca1508,190,3928,3615_cT/CTY-fitzgerald10p-Ed-FitzGerald.jpg", "sailthru.author": "By JIM PROVANCE<br>BLADE COLUMBUS BUREAU CHIEF", "description": "COLUMBUS \u2014 One campaign manager is out and another is in at an Ed FitzGerald gubernatorial campaign that is underfunded and under fire.
