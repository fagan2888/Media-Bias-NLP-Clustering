But as an organizing principle for the Internet, the concept is dangerously misguided. That is especially true of the particular form of net neutrality regulation proposed in February by Federal Communications Commission (FCC) Chairman Tom Wheeler.\n\nNet neutrality backers traffic in fear. Pushing a suite of suggested interventions, they warn of rapacious cable operators who seek to control online media and other content by \"picking winners and losers\" on the Internet. They proclaim that regulation is the only way to stave off \"fast lanes\" that would render your favorite website \"invisible\" unless it's one of the corporate-favored. They declare that it will shelter startups, guarantee free expression, and preserve the great, egalitarian \"openness\" of the Internet.\n\nIn truth, this latest campaign to regulate the Internet is an apt illustration of F.A. Hayek's famous observation that \"the curious task of economics is to demonstrate to men how little they really know about what they imagine they can design,\" write Geoffrey A. Manne and R.
