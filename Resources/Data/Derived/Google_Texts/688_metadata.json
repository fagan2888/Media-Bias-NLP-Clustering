But as of today, the car industry has taken a side, and it\u2019s not Tesla\u2019s.\n\nFrom the WSJ\u2019s Mike Ramsey:\n\nThe trade group that represents most of the big auto makers in the U.S. is for the first time weighing in on the running dispute between Tesla Motors and franchised auto dealers, urging Pennsylvania lawmakers not to give the Silicon Valley car maker a way to avoid state franchise laws that control retailing operations. The Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers is opposing legislation, which was introduced Monday, that would allow Tesla to operate its direct-sales model, but disallow other manufacturers from bypassing franchised dealers. The bill was proposed by Republican state Sen. John Rafferty Jr. , the chairman of the Transportation Committee. The senator couldn\u2019t immediately be reached for comment because he was in a legislative session.\n\nCar makers don\u2019t have the same problem as the dealers, who worry that if Tesla succeeds in cutting out the middle man, its much larger competitors might be tempted to try the same. Instead, the auto companies are opposing Tesla receiving special treatment that they say would exempt it from state franchise laws.\n\nSee the full story here\u2026", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "After staying on the sidelines, the car industry has now taken a side in one of Tesla's many battles with car dealer groups, and it's not Tesla's.", "title": "Big Auto Turns on Tesla", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/corporate-intelligence/2014/06/09/big-auto-turns-on-tesla/", "image": {"src": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/MK-CE075_TESLA_G_20130617170749.jpg"}, "site": "WSJ", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Business", "article.headline": "Big Auto Turns on Tesla", "description": "After staying on the sidelines, the car industry has now taken a side in one of Tesla's many battles with car dealer groups, and it's not Tesla's.", "article_section": "Business", "author": "Tom Gara", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "testkeys": "C", "article.page": "Corporate Intelligence Blog", "page.subsection": "Corporate Intelligence", "article.summary": "After staying on the sidelines, the car industry has now taken a side in one of Tesla's many battles with car dealer groups, and it's not Tesla's.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "page.content.format": "responsive", "article.published": "2014-06-09T22:29:11-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-157", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/corporate-intelligence/2014/06/09/big-auto-turns-on-tesla/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-234B-4809", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Business", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "After staying on the sidelines, the car industry has now taken a side in one of Tesla's many battles with car dealer groups, and it's not Tesla's.", "title": "Big Auto Turns on Tesla", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/corporate-intelligence/2014/06/09/big-auto-turns-on-tesla/", "image": {"width": 553, "identifier": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/MK-CE075_TESLA_G_20130617170749.jpg", "height": 369}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Corporate Intelligence", "article.id": "BL-234B-4809", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2014-06-09T22:30:04-04:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc526\"", "article_summary": "Instead, the auto companies are opposing Tesla receiving special treatment that they say would exempt it from state franchise laws.\nIn many states, the dealer groups have appealed to legislators claiming the company is breaching franchise laws that require cars to be sold through dealers, a claim Tesla rejects.\nThe Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers is opposing legislation, which was introduced Monday, that would allow Tesla to operate its direct-sales model, but disallow other manufacturers from bypassing franchised dealers.\nThat battle has led both to victories and defeats, but until now, one major player was neutral and on the sidelines: the big car companies themselves.\nCar makers don\u2019t have the same problem as the dealers, who worry that if Tesla succeeds in cutting out the middle man, its much larger competitors might be tempted to try the same."}
