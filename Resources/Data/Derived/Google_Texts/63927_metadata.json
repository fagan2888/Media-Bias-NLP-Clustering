In 2016, UHC participated in the public exchanges of 34 states and offered one of the two cheapest plans available in 21 percent of U.S. counties, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation.\n\nSo far, the insurer has confirmed it will pull out of public exchanges in Arkansas and Michigan and withdraw partially from the exchange in Georgia.\n\nIt is unclear whether UHC will pull out of Wisconsin\u2019s federally-facilitated Affordable Care Act exchange.\n\nA study released by the KFF on Monday found United\u2019s withdraw from marketplaces in 2017 \u201ccould have a significant impact on insurer competition and premiums in some markets, though it would have a minimal effect on the average benchmark premium nationwide.\u201d\n\nThe study estimated monthly benchmark premiums for a 40-year-old enrolled in low-cost silver plan through an ACA exchange would have been $25 to $100 higher in 304 of 3,142 U.S. counties, and more than $100 higher in 13 counties if UHC had withdrawn from all markets this year.\n\n\u201cA UnitedHealth exit would likely affect premiums most in Alabama, Arizona, Iowa, Nebraska and North Carolina,\u201d Kaiser foundation representatives wrote in a statement released Monday. \u201cSince UnitedHealth often is not one of the lower cost plans, the effect nationally on premiums of an exit by the insurer would be modest.\u201d\n\nThe KFF warned, however, that the insurer\u2019s withdrawal from the market could limit competition in some areas. According to the study, 1.8 million ACA enrollees would have a choice between only two insurers and an additional 1.1 million would only be able to buy a plan from one insurance company. Decreased competition could increase rates.\n\nBut even if UHC leaves all ACA markets, most U.S. counties and around 8.9 million ACA enrollees would still have a choice of three or more insurers, the analysis concludes.\n\nIn Wisconsin, UHC\u2019s exit from the public exchange would have a small impact on competition \u2014 only one county in the state wouldn\u2019t have a choice in an insurer.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Fearing financial losses, UnitedHealthCare CEO Stephen Hemsley said the insurance company will pull out of most public health care exchanges by 2017 during an", "og": {"site_name": "BizTimes Media", "description": "Insurer\u2019s future in Wisconsin exchange unclear.", "title": "UnitedHealthCare to exit most Obamacare exchanges by 2017", "url": "http://www.biztimes.com/2016/04/20/unitedhealthcare-to-exit-most-obamacare-exchanges-by-2017/", "image": {"width": 770, "identifier": "http://biztimes.7xwujm2pynf1lh.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/hospital-156022646-shutterstock-e1444757518705.jpg", "height": 560}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://biztimes.7xwujm2pynf1lh.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/hospital-156022646-shutterstock-e1444757518705.jpg?w=640", "site": "@BizTimesMedia", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@BizTimesMedia"}, "article": {"published_time": "2016-04-20T18:31:13+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-20T18:31:13+00:00"}, "keywords": "aca,unitedhealthcare,kaiser family foundation", "google-site-verification": "q525hWL29Np_TIsJ0g7DBGQn-HsUQezBxm172DFDNQw", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Fearing financial losses, UnitedHealthCare CEO Stephen Hemsley said the insurance company will pull out of most public health care exchanges by 2017 during an earnings call on Tuesday.\nSo far, the insurer has confirmed it will pull out of public exchanges in Arkansas and Michigan and withdraw partially from the exchange in Georgia.\nIn 2016, UHC participated in the public exchanges of 34 states and offered one of the two cheapest plans available in 21 percent of U.S. counties, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation.\nIn Wisconsin, UHC\u2019s exit from the public exchange would have a small impact on competition \u2014 only one county in the state wouldn\u2019t have a choice in an insurer.\n\u201cA UnitedHealth exit would likely affect premiums most in Alabama, Arizona, Iowa, Nebraska and North Carolina,\u201d Kaiser foundation representatives wrote in a statement released Monday."}
