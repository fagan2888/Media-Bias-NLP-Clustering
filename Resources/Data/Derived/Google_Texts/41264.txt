Tucson Police have identified the two people who allegedly stabbed a man to death near East Golf Links and South Craycroft roads on Friday. One of them has been arrested.

According to a press release, police found Trinity Corin Fowble, 18, during a traffic stop on Saturday, along with a man who also was suspected of being present when 27-year-old Nathan Olney was stabbed to death in an alley. Fowble was booked into the Pima County Jail on one count of Second Degree Murder. Charges against the man are pending.

Police say Olney was approached by Fowble and the unnamed male suspect, both of whom knew him. They got into an argument about property, and a physical altercation took place, during which police allege Fowble stabbed Olney several times and fled with the man.
