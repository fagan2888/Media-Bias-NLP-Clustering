Conventions dedicated to the 1960s TV series that spawned a pop culture movement have been held around the world for decades, but what makes this event unique is that it\u2019s being held within a complete reproduction of the original series\u2019 set.\n\n\u2018Star Trek: The Original Series\u2019 only ran 79 episodes in the late 1960s before it was cancelled. Numerous popular spinoffs and movies are still being made today. But, for many, the original did it best with Captain Kirk, Spock, and McCoy.\n\nDedicated Trekkies have produced their own episodes for years, but one webseries is filmed on a full-scale replica of the original set in Ticonderoga.\n\n\u201cThis is one of the control panels that goes into the engineering display in the back.\u201d\n\nJust inside the doorway of his studio, James Cawley is walking through the set of his webseries, \u2018Star Trek New Voyages.\u2019 Come Labor Day weekend, this will be the location of Trekonderoga, the city\u2019s first Star Trek convention. And there\u2019s a lot of work to be done in the next week.\n\nBut it will get done. Cawley has more than 200 volunteers that help out.\n\n\u201cWhen you say Star Trek, people come out of the woodwork,\u201d he says.\n\nToday, it\u2019s just the two of us. Cawley agreed to take me on a tour.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re entering the corridors. This is the Transporter Room of the Enterprise. This wall is pulled out because the camera crews come in this way and shoot in this direction. Obviously these things have to be put back in before we open for the convention. We just wrapped up a film shoot so it\u2019s a little chaotic.\u201d\n\nAlthough it looks like the control panel is in for repairs, sure enough, there\u2019s the Transporter where Scotty beams up Kirk and his crew.\n\nCawley started building Star Trek sets in 1997. The webseries began filming in 2003 and last year, operations were moved into this studio.\n\nWalking through the corridor, we visit Kirk\u2019s quarters, complete with a replica of his orange bed and knick-knacks on his shelf.\n\nIn an incomplete version of McCoy\u2019s sickbay, Cawley shows me the blueprints for the Enterprise set.\n\n\u201cThis is what we work from, as far as dimensions, you know, we know the actual scale with a scale ruler. You know, we do all this kind of stuff.\u201d\n\nThese are the same plans used in the original series. Cawley got them from the original Star Trek costume designer, whom he befriended while working on Star Trek: The Next Generation.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t bring the originals down here, I just took it to Kinko\u2019s and had it copied.\u201d\n\nThe plans are great for dimensions, but for all the other little details, Cawley and his team rely on photos and high-definition screen shots taken from the series on Blu-ray. Everything has to be perfect, from the paneling on the walls, to the twinkling buttons on the bridge.\n\n\u201cThere was these ice cube trays that made these little tiny square ice cubes for RV trailers and things like that. They called them midget cubes and they filled them full of colored resin and turned them upside down and they became all the square buttons on the bridge.\u201d\n\nSitting at the controls Cawley tells me a little about himself.\n\n\u201cMy full-time job is to play Elvis in a live touring show which I\u2019ve done now more years than I care to talk about,\u201d says Cawley.\n\n\u201cAnd that explains\u2026\u201d I ask.\n\n\u201cThat explains the hair.\u201d\n\nCawley says he\u2019s a nostalgic person. He\u2019s got a black Elvis do and sideburns. He\u2019s wearing a t-shirt with Batman and Robin on it \u2013 from the old comic books, of course.\n\n\u201cI really don\u2019t like modern television, hate it. There\u2019s just nothing there for me. I like character driven stories and I like to feel good when the show is over.\u201d\n\nThe new \u2018Star Trek\u2019 films by J.J. Abrams? Cawley calls them \u2018Star Trek\u2019 for the \u201cPlaystation Generation.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat it is about the original series that all the other lacks is, first of all, it was the group of characters and the actors that brought them to life. And the stories were so good. You could forgive the bad special effects of the period and the lack of dollars and production design because the stories and the characters were so good. The show is going to be here a hundred years from now.\u201d\n\n\u201cHey!\u201d\n\n\u201cSir, how are you?\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s Cawley\u2019s landlord, Jim Major. I asked him about what he thought about there being a spaceship in his building.\n\n\u201cWhen I rented to them I crossed my fingers and did some praying because I wasn\u2019t sure that it was gonna fly, but they\u2019ve been super successful.\u201d\n\nMajor says he\u2019s not much of a \u2018Star Trek\u2019 fan, but he believes in the upcoming convention.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m absolutely behind him and my wife is volunteering for him, so family\u2019s in there.\u201d\n\nAfter my tour, Cawley loads up an episode of his webseries on his phone, which, by the way, is completely fan-funded. While he doesn\u2019t act in it much anymore, he\u2019s still overseeing its production and hopes to continue making it as long as there\u2019s people willing to support it.\n\n\u201cIt just kind of shows you what a dedicated people can do without a Hollywood budget.\u201d\n\nFor more information visit: http://www.trekonderoga.com/\n\n", "article_metadata": {"category": "Arts/Culture", "description": "Listen \n        Listening...", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://wnpr.org/post/star-trek-convention-coming-ticonderoga", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/shared/npr/styles/medium/nprshared/201508/435232009.JPG", "type": "article", "description": "Listen \n        Listening...", "title": "Star Trek Convention Coming To Ticonderoga"}, "story_id": 435225739, "twitter": {"site": "@wnpr", "card": "summary", "creator": "@wnpr"}, "author": "Lucas Willard", "org_id": 298, "dc": {"title": "Star Trek Convention Coming To Ticonderoga"}, "nid": 45899, "datePublished": "2015-08-28", "keywords": "New York, entertainment, television", "wordCount": 1032, "has_audio": 1, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc195\"", "article_summary": "Cawley got them from the original Star Trek costume designer, whom he befriended while working on Star Trek: The Next Generation.\nThis Labor Day weekend, the small city of Ticonderoga, New York, will host its first \u2018Star Trek\u2019 convention.\n\u2018Star Trek: The Original Series\u2019 only ran 79 episodes in the late 1960s before it was cancelled.\nI like character driven stories and I like to feel good when the show is over.\u201dThe new \u2018Star Trek\u2019 films by J.J.
