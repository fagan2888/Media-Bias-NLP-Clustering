But to people who have watched the last 20 years of the Republican politics of trade, it\u2019s one of those developments that seemed inevitable, but whose timing was impossible to predict. Who would have thought that a New York real estate developer would have busted the party open on trade?\n\nDonald Trump, now the presumptive Republican nominee, is bound to make an issue of it. Sure, Hillary Clinton opposes the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the 12-nation trade agreement that President Barack Obama negotiated. But as secretary of state, Clinton promoted it. And the other Clinton \u2014 Bill \u2014 has fingerprints all over a raft of trade deals. Does anyone seriously think it won\u2019t be a Donald Trump talking point in a general election?\n\nGlib interpretations of the politics of trade for the last 20 years have pinned the controversy on the rise of \u201cprotectionism\u201d \u2014 which has become a vague political epithet rather than a useful label \u2014 in a Democratic Party where labor unions wield considerable influence. And there is no question that they changed the Democratic dynamics on trade.\n\nTheir issue has been simple: trade agreements cost jobs. It\u2019s a debatable point, since offshoring has been a fact of American economic life since the 1960s. Severe recessions in countries with which the United States trades squeezes cyclical employment in export industries far more than trade agreements. Nevertheless, labor adamantly opposes new trade deals, and none more vociferously than the one with China in 2000.\n\nThe simmering reality of Republican politics on trade: since the mid-1990s, they\u2019ve been a bottle with the cork in too tight over trade.\n\nThe Republican leadership in Washington, from Newt Gingrich and Denny Hastert to John Boehner and Paul Ryan never wavered in their support for deals like the North American Free Trade Agreement, the Uruguay Round that created the World Trade Organization and, above all, a landmark pact with China that Bill Clinton pushed through in 2000.\n\nBeneath the surface, core Republican constituencies seethed at its leadership.\n\nThey had a few champions in Congress. Rep. Chris Smith of New Jersey never stopped talking about human rights in China, with a particular focus on persecuted Christians. Former Sen. Fred Thompson of Tennessee hammered away at security issues like China\u2019s proliferation of weapons technology. The late Rep. Charlie Norwood of Georgia, in a final speech raging against the China deal, called on lawmakers to demonstrate that \u201cliberty shines brighter than gold.\u201d\n\nAnd, contrary to every shred of conventional wisdom about where you might find a union lobbyist, some Republicans, like Rep. Duncan Hunter of California, maintained cordial relationships with labor.\n\nBut those champions never organized themselves around the issue the way they might abortion or Obamacare or any of the other issues that really animate Republican voters. Republican opponents of free trade never had the kind of people who coordinated lobbying, took names, and built bridges with undecided lawmakers. In short, though they had a lot of voters with them, they didn\u2019t have a Washington organization.\n\nBy contrast, establishment Republicans had the business lobby on their side \u2014 led by multinationals like Caterpillar, IBM, and General Electric \u2014 and rightly conveyed the impression of having a well-oiled machine that could roll out and crush congressional opposition to new trade deals. Wavering Republican members of Congress \u2014 or ones who simply wanted the issue to go away \u2014 found themselves under pressure from local businesses, and enjoyed fundraising largesse in Washington.\n\nFlash forward to 2016, and the craziness that is the Republican presidential primary. Front-runner Donald Trump has embraced a neo-isolationist foreign policy that rejects free-trade agreements and calls for a wall of tariffs against Mexican and Chinese imports. These would have been entirely common Republican ideas 100 years ago but then it would have been at the behest of business looking to keep competitors out, not laborers worried about low-wage competition.\n\nTony Fratto, a former official of the George W. Bush administration who now runs a public relations firm that counts key corporate lobby groups as clients, told The Wall Street Journal that, \u201cIn some ways, the Republican Party is becoming like the traditional Democratic Party\u201d in its opposition to free trade.\n\nBut Fratto\u2019s point is only half correct. The Republican Party was always much more like the Democrats than its leadership cared to admit, but the tendencies were masked by partisan rancor and a lack of an effective spokesman or organized apparatus in Washington.\n\nIn short, Trump provided in spades what Republican opponents of free trade were lacking for so long: leadership. And even if he loses the Republican nomination or the general election, Trump has pried the cork out of the bottle with relatively little effort. Putting it back in, if that\u2019s even possible, won\u2019t come easily.\n\nDonald Trump by Carter Dougherty", "article_metadata": {"description": "Donald Trump - Hillary Clinton opposes the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the 12-nation trade agreement that President Barack Obama negotiated", "generator": "WPZOOM Framework 1.6.0", "og": {"site_name": "ValueWalk", "description": "Donald Trump - Hillary Clinton opposes the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the 12-nation trade agreement that President Barack Obama negotiated", "title": "Donald Trump Has Turned GOP Trade Policy on Itself", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 480, "identifier": "http://www.valuewalk.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Donald-Trump-Riots.jpg", "height": 360}, "url": "http://www.valuewalk.com/2016/05/donald-trump-trade-policy/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "How Donald Trump Has Turned GOP Trade Policy on Its Head Trade policy is teed up to be a major issue in the presidential campaign, though not in the ways anyone could have anticipated a few years [...]", "creator": "@valuewalk", "url": "http://www.valuewalk.com/2016/05/donald-trump-trade-policy/", "image": "http://www.valuewalk.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Donald-Trump-Riots.jpg", "title": "How Donald Trump Has Turned GOP Trade Policy on Its Head", "site": "@valuewalk", "card": "photo"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 294013504001864, "pages": 144640855575863}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.valuewalk.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/cropped-ValueWalk-site-icon-270x270.png", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/valuewalk", "section": "Politics", "tag": "trade", "published_time": "2016-05-05T08:19:41+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "How Donald Trump Has Turned GOP Trade Policy on Its HeadTrade policy is teed up to be a major issue in the presidential campaign, though not in the ways anyone could have anticipated a few years ago.\nIn short, Trump provided in spades what Republican opponents of free trade were lacking for so long: leadership.\nRepublican opponents of free trade never had the kind of people who coordinated lobbying, took names, and built bridges with undecided lawmakers.\nNevertheless, labor adamantly opposes new trade deals, and none more vociferously than the one with China in 2000.\nAnd the other Clinton \u2014 Bill \u2014 has fingerprints all over a raft of trade deals."}
