Meanwhile, full fathom five below the dead calm waters the leviathan Trump waits in his comfortable darkness, circling forward, circling back, solitary, malevolent, content in his bulking grievances, patiently awaiting his moment to rise and smash his rival.\n\nThings go eerily quiet and still before the California primaries. At this stage, the two major parties have discredited themselves so thoroughly that a necrotic stink wafts around the election of \u201916. Who put that road-kill possum in Hillary\u2019s podium? Why does Donald look every week more and more like a lurching Golem? The parties are rudderless. Their leaders range the decks like wailing revenants.\n\nIt\u2019s as if the mortal remains of Millard Fillmore and James Buchanan have come from the grave to eat the brains of Debbie Wasserman Schultz and Reince Priebus. The rectified essence of every zombie fantasy churned out of Hollywood seeps through the capillaries of the dying political establishment, as it stews and ferments and waits to be loaded on the garbage barge of history.\n\nHillary threw a \u201chail Mary\u201d after the Oregon debacle, proposing that husband Bill would become some kind of economic czar in her inevitable \u201cturn\u201d at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. That\u2019s when you knew her crusade was doomed. It raised such a snickering in the media that the sick tropes of HBO\u2019s Veep show looked like press releases from Proctor & Gamble\u2019s PR office in comparison. Bill did such a great job at repealing the Glass-Steagall Act, maybe this dynamic duo of lawyers (\u201ctwo for the price of one!\u201d) can work on eliminating the anti-trust laws, the First Amendment, and the writ of habeas corpus \u2014 and then America can become a fullblown banana republic.\n\nTrump has evidently been working on that smile of his: the slitty eyes, the weird horizontal lip stretch under that baleen of head-gear, the perfect expression of his white whale-hood. The crew from the ghostly GOP Pequod still doesn\u2019t know what the heck to do about him. They rock above the depths in their flimsy dinghies, harpoons drooping, waiting for the sea to boil below them and their boats to splinter.\n\nThat will precede a more general splintering to come of the republic, first by demographics, then by territory. The most exceptional thing about the US has been the rapidity of its rise and now fall in the roll-call of empires. We barely had time to put together a coherent culture that historians of the future (enjoying ratatouille with fresh rat by firelight) could identify, and now it\u2019s all percolating into a dreadful maelstrom in which one catches glimpses of the Kardashians, PT Barnum, Betsy Ross, Davey Crockett, and Eleanor Roosevelt amid the detritus of broken Tupperware and flapping pages of the Affordable Care Act. What a goddamned mess we\u2019ve left to posterity.\n\nSomething is in the air that tells me Hillary will be dumped by the convention in Philadelphia in favor of Uncle Joe Biden, bidin\u2019 his time practically next door in Wilmington. Speaking of turns, isn\u2019t it Delaware\u2019s turn for a president? He\u2019ll be a respectable place-holder, and he might even get elected, though the party will dissolve before he\u2019s done, just in time for Texas to secede from the Union and set the tone for California, Oregon, and Washington State. Before you know it, the political map will look like 1861 again.\n\nDonald Trump will be forgotten before Thanksgiving. He will leave a bizarre mental imprint on the life of the nation-that-was, something like a bad acid trip. And then the people of North America may actually have to start grappling with the problems induced by a failed banking system, population overshoot, climate instability, and the lost boundaries of social behavior.\n\n(Support Kunstler\u2019s writing by visiting his Patreon Page: https://www.patreon.com/JamesHowardKunstler?ty=h)\n\nShare this:\n\n\n\nTweet\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Anderson Valley Advertiser", "description": "I hope you\u2019re enjoying these horse latitudes of the political year, when the seas suddenly turn glassy and the Berning sun begins to roast all the diverse and inclusive hands on Hillary\u2019s deck, who\u2026", "title": "Lower Away", "url": "http://theava.com/archives/56607", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "article": {"published_time": "2016-05-25T14:24:28+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-05-25T18:30:06+00:00"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary"}, "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2ef2\"", "article_summary": "At this stage, the two major parties have discredited themselves so thoroughly that a necrotic stink wafts around the election of \u201916.\nHe will leave a bizarre mental imprint on the life of the nation-that-was, something like a bad acid trip.\nThe most exceptional thing about the US has been the rapidity of its rise and now fall in the roll-call of empires.\nBefore you know it, the political map will look like 1861 again.\nThat will precede a more general splintering to come of the republic, first by demographics, then by territory."}
