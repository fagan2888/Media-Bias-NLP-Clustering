They get together at least twice a week.\n\nOn this day, they\u2019re talking about sex. More specifically, about protection.\n\n\u201cIn the heat of the moment sometimes, a guy doesn't necessarily reach for a condom,\u201d Williams tells Dwayne Jackson, 14, and Traivon Harris, 15.\n\nThe boys get bashful and chuckle at William\u2019s blunt delivery.\n\nBut Williams said he has to talk this way about safe sex with his young men. Many young, heterosexual black men don\u2019t consider themselves at risk for HIV/AIDS.\n\n\u201cThe thing is people feel invincible and I think it\u2019s extremely naive and ignorant for people to think they\u2019re invincible,\u201d he said.\n\nForty-one percent of new infections in Florida are in the black community, according to the Florida Department of Health\u2019s data on new HIV diagnoses in 2013. And many of those getting infected are straight black men, a group observers and HIV specialists say are not being included in HIV prevention efforts.\n\nWilliams is co-director of Generational Cure, a Miami nonprofit that provides mentors for young black teens. When he talks about sex with the teens, there are no PowerPoint presentations, no pamphlets.\n\nWilliams said it\u2019s \u201creal talk\u201d with teens who have their own ideas about safe sex. Jackson, the 14-year old, is a virgin.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s okay to have unprotected sex with a girl you have been with for a long time because that girl you might know,\u201d Jackson said.\n\nWilliams corrects him. \u201cIt\u2019s not okay at all to have unprotected sex.\u201d\n\nHarris, the 15-year-old, provides his take. He recently lost his virginity.\n\n\u201cI thought about it before I did it. I made sure I had protection. I made sure the condom was lubricated,\u201d Harris said. \u201cI made sure it wasn\u2019t expired.\u201d\n\nStraight, Black Men Need Information\n\nDr. Cheryl Holder, an internist and HIV specialist, said it\u2019s important that community groups and other institutions in the black community talk openly and honestly about black straight men who are HIV-positive.\n\nHolder, who works in a clinic in Miami\u2019s Liberty City neighborhood and teaches at Florida International University\u2019s medical school, said national ad campaigns around HIV typically target gender and sexual orientation.\n\n\u201cI just saw an ad, it was an ad with two males and you would probably think they\u2019re two young gay males,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve seen ads on bus benches of women, but you don\u2019t see a message, \u2018Where did these women get HIV?\u2019\u201d\n\nHolder said the limited messaging puts the onus on black women to protect themselves. And it doesn\u2019t force black men to consider their part, she said.\n\n\u201cDefinitely if the man would put the condom on and not force the woman to have to negotiate that relationship, we would see a whole lot less transmission to the women,\u201d she said.\n\nHolder said she feels the lack of outreach is at least partly responsible for some of the problems she sees. Many of her straight black male patients look for excuses not to take an HIV test. They think they can tell their partner\u2019s status based on how she looks . Or they think HIV and AIDS are gay diseases, she said.\n\nHolder tries to debunk these misconceptions. But by the time many of her straight male clients who are infected with HIV do come in for treatment, she said she finds their T-cell counts are very low and the men already are showing signs of serious infection.\n\nThe consequences are significant, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Every year, between 1988 and 2010, HIV was the leading cause of death in Florida for black people between the ages of 25 and 44.\n\nThe numbers have started to drop. HIV was the fifth leading cause of death for the black population in Florida in 2013.\n\n\u201cA lot of the heterosexual transmission occurred among people who had multiple partners and substance abuse,\u201d Holder said. \u201cIt\u2019s [sexual] activity.\u201d\n\nHIV\u2019s Not a Gay Disease\n\nJeffrey Edwards, a Miami Gardens resident, contracted HIV in 1988. He said he was infected by having unprotected sex with a woman.\n\n\u201cA lot of people thought it was just that, that people with AIDS was gay,\u201d he said. \u201cIt ain\u2019t like that.\u201d\n\nBack then; Edwards said he didn\u2019t know much about the virus. Now, he uses his personal story as a cautionary tale when talking to the young men in his neighborhood.\n\nHe said he\u2019s surprised young men want to have unprotected sex, despite all the information that\u2019s out there today. On the other hand, he said, they haven\u2019t seen AIDs kill people the way it used to.\n\n\u201cI hear young guys say\u2026they\u2019re not going to use no rubber,\u201d Edwards said. \u201cI say, \u2018You making a big mistake.\u2019\u201d\n\nWilliams, the mentor at Generational Cure, said straight black men can\u2019t be invisible when talking about HIV. Young men need \u201creal talk\u201d about safe sex, said the man the teens call Mr. Charles.\n\n\u201cWe want them to know that these things can actually happen,\u201d he said.\n\nHIV and AIDs don't get as much attention they used to, Williams said, but it is serious.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t see on the news where someone dies of HIV/AIDS,\u201d Williams said.\n\nDwayne, the 14-year old Williams mentors, said he is listening.\n\n\u201cThe reason why I thought unprotected sex was cool is that if you\u2019re with a girl for a long time it\u2019s OK,\u201d he said. \u201cI learned it\u2019s not OK -- as Mr. Charles said.\u201d\n\nWilliams\u2019 hopes that message stays with Dwayne and the other young men he mentors. He\u2019s counting on that real talk to convey the real consequences of HIV.\n\nNadege Green is a reporter with WLRN in Miami.
