Some 12 years after the first “Pirates of the Carribbean” movie came out, Captain Jack Sparrow is back, and he’s doing his part in bringing cheer to sick kids.

In his latest endeavor, 52-year-old actor Johnny Depp visited Lady Cilento Children’s Hospital in Australia, clad entirely in his pirate costume and makeup and accompanied by his sidekick Scrum. Amazingly, he didn’t break character once, stopping to talk and joke with each child individually.

“He was taking his time to make sure he spoke to each and every one of them,” Rachel Bennett, the mother of a 7-year-old boy with transverse myelitis, told Australia’s ABC News. “It was really beautiful. Everyone kept on trying to move him on, but he kept on coming back.”

Even though Depp had originally asked people to keep the visit on the down low, photos soon emerged on social media as many of the children asked to take “selfies” with the pirate. Rachel Bennett’s son, Max, had seen all the “Pirates of the Carribbean” movies and took several photos with Depp.

“He was funny,” Max told ABC News. “He tied a knot in his hair to make a beard, that was my favorite part.”

The video was filmed by Juice TV, a special initiative for a TV show made by kids in hospitals, for kids in hospitals. Every week, Juiced TV films a 30-minute TV show at Lady Cilento Children’s Hospital. Watch the video and it will be hard not to smile.
