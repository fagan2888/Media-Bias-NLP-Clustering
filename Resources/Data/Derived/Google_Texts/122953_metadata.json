The law provides an exemption for religious employers, as well as an \u201caccommodation\u201d that applies more broadly to religious nonprofit organizations. This allows employers who object on religious grounds to providing contraception to opt out of paying for coverage, while allowing individual employees to seek coverage from a third party.\n\nThe plaintiffs contended that even though they qualified for the federal accommodation, the law remained an unfair burden on the exercise of their religious beliefs. By simply participating in the process, they argued, they were forced to compromise their belief system.\n\n\u201cPlaintiffs argue that opting out of the coverage requirement substantially burdens their religious exercise because they believe that by doing so, they facilitate access to products and services they find objectionable,\u201d the appellate decision said.\n\nA federal court in Brooklyn had agreed with the plaintiffs, but the Second Circuit reversed its ruling Friday, finding that the exemption imposed only a \u201cde minimis burden.\u201d\n\n\u201cThus, under the challenged regulatory scheme, the only obligation actually imposed on Plaintiffs is identifying themselves as religious objectors. Through a modicum of paperwork, an eligible organization throws the entire administrative and financial burden of providing contraceptive coverage on its insurer or third-party administrator, generally organizations with no objection to providing contraceptive coverage,\u201d the court said in its opinion.\n\nThe Second Circuit noted that similar claims are being denied throughout the country.\n\n\u201cIn the time since the district court issued its opinion, six circuits have rejected these claims, either on the merits or by denial of a preliminary injunction,\u201d the appellate court said.\n\nAlong with these cases, the U.S. Supreme Court has touched on the issue in last year\u2019s Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, and other cases continue to move through the system, the Second Circuit ruling noted, with new cases potentially finding their way to the nation\u2019s highest court.\n\nThe decision notes that the Hobby Lobby case appears to resolve the issue by specifically pointing to the accommodation that allows nonprofit groups to opt out of a direct concern over conflict between the contraception mandates and their religious beliefs.\n\n\u201cPlaintiffs contend that the opposite is true. Plaintiffs believe that by submitting the opt-out notification to the government or their third-party administrators, they are indirectly facilitating the provision to their employees of products and services that have contraceptive and \u2018abortion-inducing\u2019 effects, an act which violates their religious beliefs,\u201d the appellate court\u2019s decision said.\n\nWhile the Catholic groups argue that they believe that their religious beliefs are being unduly burdened by the accommodation, the court noted that the Religious Freedom Restoration Act\u2019s threshold is a substantive one\u2014whether or not a burden can be proven, not just believed.\n\nThe appellate court\u2019s decision went into detail over the plaintiff\u2019s claims that not complying would also prove a burden, with the court calling the argument a \u201cnon sequitur\u201d because of how unburdensome the process of complying actually is. Likewise, the court found the plaintiff\u2019s argument that by simply participating in the accommodation results in a \u201ctrigger\u201d that provides contraception, noting that the opt is a means of identifying and exempting employers, forcing the government to step in.\n\n\u201cPlaintiffs\u2019 decision to opt out is not the cause of the ultimate contraceptive coverage; rather this coverage happens in spite of them,\u201d the court\u2019s decision read.\n\nRead the court's decision here: http://politi.co/1EdJApF", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.capitalnewyork.com/article/city-hall/2015/08/8573692/appeals-court-reverses-ruling-obamacare-religious-rights", "image": "http://www.capitalnewyork.com/sites/default/files/a%20-%20appeals%20court_0.png", "type": "article", "title": "Appeals court reverses ruling on Obamacare religious rights"}, "robots": "all", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "description": "Court says contraception exemption does not impose burdens on objectors"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3eba\"", "article_summary": "The law provides an exemption for religious employers, as well as an \u201caccommodation\u201d that applies more broadly to religious nonprofit organizations.\nThe Affordable Care Act\u2019s birth control exemption for religious groups goes far enough to relieve the burden on their religious freedom, a federal appeals court in New York ruled Friday, overturning a lower court\u2019s decision.\n\u201cPlaintiffs\u2019 decision to opt out is not the cause of the ultimate contraceptive coverage; rather this coverage happens in spite of them,\u201d the court\u2019s decision read.\nRead the court's decision here: http://politi.co/1EdJApF\nThe plaintiffs contended that even though they qualified for the federal accommodation, the law remained an unfair burden on the exercise of their religious beliefs."}
