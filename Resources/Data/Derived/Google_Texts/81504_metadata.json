So there\u2019s no chance he homeschooled his own five children through their growing-up years, including his son Rand, the Tea-party backed conservative senator from Kentucky.\n\nBut the 78-year-old physician would like all parents today to homeschool their kids as an alternative to \u201cgovernment controlled education.\u201d\n\nRon Paul has just launched his own curriculum \u2013 aptly entitled the Ron Paul Curriculum. It consists of \u201crigorous study\u201d in economics, history, math, and the sciences. It's big on writing. It emphasizes self direction, but he says it \u201cdoes not place promoting an ideological agenda ahead of ensuring that students receive a quality education.\u201d\n\nHomeschooling \u201cgives people an option,\u201d Paul said in an interview. \u201cI like options and I like competition. I\u2019d like to see a higher quality of education in this country.\u201d\n\nRELATED: WHY OUR TEACHERS CAN\u2019T TEACH\n\nThe former Texas congressman says we have thrown too much money at public school systems that fail to educate children for a 21st century global economy. \u201cThe bigger our government has gotten, the more involved they\u2019ve gotten \u2013 and the more expensive education has gotten. The quality of our education has gone down as a result.\u201d\n\nThe number of homeschooled students in the U.S. rose 36 percent in a five-year period \u2013 from 1.1 million in 2003 to 1.5 million in 2007, according to the National Center for Education Statistics, using the latest data available.\n\nHomeschooling is now a movement. It\u2019s the \"one authentically radical social movement of any real significance in the United States,\u201d according to an article last year by Kevin D. Williamson in the National Review.\n\nBut not everyone is ready to embrace this movement. Many serious-minded parents who might want to be homeschoolers can\u2019t. They try it and drop out. Most have to work; others are not capable of teaching a fish how to swim let alone instruct a teen on advanced calculus. Still others have children with special needs and can\u2019t go it alone.\n\nAt the core, parents want their kids to be in groups \u2013 they want them socialized, ready for human challenges as well as academic ones.\n\nHomeschooling is nothing if not isolating, which is exactly why some are committed to it. They don\u2019t trust the schools (or the kids in them) and they\u2019d rather ladle on their particular world view (including religious beliefs) than have their kids exposed to the evils around them.\n\nBUT WHAT DOES IT COST?\n\nPaul talks about homeschooling as a \u201cgood investment.\u201d Students and their families will save hundreds if not thousands of dollars on textbooks, travel, and other education costs.\n\nHis curriculum, however, requires a credit card or a debit card to sign up.\n\nThe curriculum for grades K-5 is \u201ccompletely free,\u201d his website says. But that only gains you access to the curriculum. You\u2019re cut off from information-rich \u201cmember boards and forums,\u201d unless you become a paying member. (The exact payment is not immediately clear unless you enroll; there is a money back guarantee, though.)\n\nThe expenses are different for kids in grades 6\u201312. For access to the \u201ctutorial forums\u201d and the courses, that\u2019s $250 per family a year. The courses each cost $50 per student. \u201cBut parents are encouraged to study alongside any of their children, as in any homeschool curriculum. Parents are free. Siblings are not.\u201d\n\nSo Paul \u2013 who spent most of his life as a politician \u2013 has now turned to education as a Plan B. He\u2019s not in the White House but he\u2019s in the schoolhouse, of sorts.\n\nPaul acknowledges the challenges of homeschooling, something his new book, The School Revolution, also makes clear: \u201cNot everyone can do this. There has to be an extra effort made. Sometimes, if it\u2019s a single parent, it\u2019s going to be tougher. If there are two parents, they might have to adjust one person\u2019s schedule to be able to spend half a day teaching the kids.\u201d\n\nThis libertarian hates laws, though: \u201cI\u2019d hate to see a law that says everybody has to be homeschooled. There will be adaptations. The one thing about homeschooling is there\u2019s going to be variety.\"\n\nHe adds, \u201cThe bureaucrats in the Dept. of Education as well as the teacher unions are very determined to try to stop this. Quite frankly, they\u2019re pretty embarrassed because there\u2019s been so much success [in the homeschooling movement]. We have a much different approach to education.\u201d\n\nAfter all: \u201cBig government dictating everything we do in our personal lives, our economic lives, dictating to everybody overseas as well \u2013 I generally resent all that.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s a portion of a Q and A about his curriculum that Paul includes on his site:\n\nYou mean there are no textbooks?\n\nNone that you must buy. You will download any old textbooks when you buy the course.\n\nHow can you teach without recent textbooks?\n\nWith free original source documents, original materials, and free public domain documents.\n\nHow will I know if my child is learning?\n\nFor high school, the best way is to have the student take a CLEP exam. For any grade of 50 or higher, some colleges will give full college credit for this. It is possible for a student to quiz out of his first two years of college this way. That can save you a small fortune, and it saves the student two years.\n\nDo you have plans to set up a Ron Paul Academy?\n\nNo.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Ron Paul spent decades as an OB-GYN, served in Congress for twelve terms and ran for p", "title": "Ron Paul Hawks Homeschooling As a Plan B", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2013/09/19/Ron-Paul-Hawks-Homeschooling-Plan-B", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/09202013_Homeschool.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2013/09/19/Ron-Paul-Hawks-Homeschooling-Plan-B", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/09202013_Homeschool.jpg", "title": "The Fiscal Times", "card": "summary", "creator": "@maurmack"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "Ron Paul spent decades as an OB-GYN, served in Congress for twelve terms and ran for p", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fced4e\"", "article_summary": "Quite frankly, they\u2019re pretty embarrassed because there\u2019s been so much success [in the homeschooling movement].\nBut the 78-year-old physician would like all parents today to homeschool their kids as an alternative to \u201cgovernment controlled education.\u201dRon Paul has just launched his own curriculum \u2013 aptly entitled the Ron Paul Curriculum.\nPaul acknowledges the challenges of homeschooling, something his new book, The School Revolution, also makes clear: \u201cNot everyone can do this.\nRon Paul spent decades as an OB-GYN, served in Congress for twelve terms and ran for president three times (you know how that went).\nPaul talks about homeschooling as a \u201cgood investment.\u201d Students and their families will save hundreds if not thousands of dollars on textbooks, travel, and other education costs."}
