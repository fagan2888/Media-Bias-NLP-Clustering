But Democrats are in the majority where it matters, and Republicans caucusing in the high school auditorium Tuesday evening told each other they were fed up with the way liberal leaders are running their country, state and county into the ground.\n\n\u201cWho\u2019s ready to send Mark Udall at the Senate home? \u201d said county GOP Chairman Rick Fernandez. The roughly 200, mostly middle-aged voters smiled and cheered.\n\nFernandez soon zeroed in on the main target in Broomfield this election year \u2013 state Rep. Dianne Primavera, who has served six years, on and off, representing Broomfield\u2019s House District 33 on the exurban plains north of Denver.\n\nPrimavera\u2019s Democratic supporters were caucusing in the library just one long, blue-locker-lined hallway away.\n\n\u201cI want you to make a lot of noise on this one so they can hear you on the other side of the school,\u201d Fernandez told caucus-goers. \u201cWho\u2019s ready to send Dianne Primavera home? I want you to remember how you felt last year when Dianne Primavera was voting away our Second Amendment rights\u2026 Are you ready to send her home?\u201d\n\nFernandez was referring to Primavera\u2019s votes last spring for two controversial gun-control laws \u2014 one that closed loopholes on background checks for gun purchases and another that banned sales of ammunition magazines that hold more than 15 rounds. The new laws spurred a recall movement last summer that ousted two Democratic senators and prompted another to step down.\n\nFernandez\u2019s fiery speech and the conversations among voters milling in the school hallways echoed recall-movement rhetoric and Tea Party sentiment expressed most volubly in 2010, when anti-Obamacare town halls made headlines around the state and gave Republicans a one-seat majority in the House at the state legislature. Broomfield Republicans that year sent their candidate, businessman Don Beezley, to Denver. He beat Primavera by 314 votes.\n\nThe talk was still about Obamacare, loss of liberty and \u201ctaking back the country,\u201d but the tone Tuesday night was less angry than it was last summer and in 2010. It was more hopeful.\n\nBroomfield\u2019s caucus-goers were openly upbeat about recent surprise late-entries in races for two top seats in the state. Young, telegenic Congressman Cory Gardner has joined the race to unseat U.S. Sen. Udall. And former Congressman Bob Beauprez announced Monday that he had entered the field now running to replace Gov. John Hickenlooper.\n\nRepublican voters, including Tea Party and libertarian Coloradans, haven\u2019t hesitated to level insults at the party establishment in past years when grassroots efforts to choose candidates seem to have been undermined by insider annointments made in Denver and Washington \u2014 deals that can make old-school, retail political events like a caucus seem nothing more than show.\n\nBut there was none of that kind of grumbling Tuesday in the wake of the wheeling and dealing that led to last week\u2019s so-called \u201cCentennial State Swap,\u201d in which candidates shuffled races and dropped out to make way for Gardner.\n\n\u201cLook, I think we\u2019re all feeling a lot of good energy coming off these late entries,\u201d said David Pigott, a lawyer who is one of two Republicans vying for the chance to run against Rep. Primavera. \u201cThe Senate and Governor race shakeups are a good thing. It\u2019s a good sign. Six months ago, these guys weren\u2019t interested. They didn\u2019t think they could win those races. Now they clearly think they can.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re all feeling a tremendous amount of momentum from the recall elections.\u201d\n\nPigott said Broomfield, at least, is benefitting from local party leadership that has avoided the kind of divisions that have plagued the right in other parts of the state and nation in the Tea Party era.\n\n\u201cThe leaders here have worked really hard to make sure liberty-minded voters feel involved\u2026 There is no acrimony here.\u201d\n\nBut in 2012, the vote on the right was split between Piggot and Libertarian candidate W. Earl Allen. And this year Piggot is facing a strong primary opponent in Marijo Tinlin, a management consultant who, like Beauprez and Gardner, is a late-entry candidate. She said she just announced this week.\n\n\u201cI think all the news, it just adds to the chatter. It gets voters excited and, in a midterm election, you need energy. Beauprez and Gardner, they\u2019re good candidates,\u201d she said.\n\nIf the past is any measure, Tinlin said the race against Primavera will be expensive. Primavera raised and spent $140,000 in 2012. Outside groups that support her spent another $100,000.\n\nTinlin, who has worked as a salesperson and professional fundraiser, told the caucus goers that she is the best choice to keep pace with Primavera in the money race. Tinlin\u2019s also a mom. In the bedroom communities that make up the district \u2014 and in a race against Primavera, who lists her role as a mother high on her resume \u2014 that credential is an important one.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019ll talk about being a mom, and so will I. Voters here are talking about education, about Common Core testing. I have kids in school,\u201d Tinlin said.\n\nVoter Sandra Scott Smith, 66, was attending her first-ever caucus Tuesday.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s my first shebang,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve been all talk and no action, so here I am!\u201d\n\nNate Randall, 33, was one of the youngest of Broomfield\u2019s Republican caucus-goers. He said the party is experiencing some \u201cchaos\u201d lately, but he didn\u2019t think that\u2019s a bad thing. \u201cI like less control. It makes things interesting,\u201d he said.\n\nIn the night\u2019s non-binding straw poll, Secretary of State Scott Gessler came out way on top in the governor\u2019s race with 46.3 percent of the vote in Broomfield. Fernandez said the Secretary established a strong reputation in the county as election administrators worked through a close and contested off-year election and recount last November. \u201cHe has made the rounds.\u201d\n\nGessler was followed in Broomfield\u2019s straw poll by Beauprez, who notched 29 percent. Then came state Senator Greg Brophy with 6.2 percent, former state Senator Mike Kopp with 3.7 percent and Adams County Republican Party Chairman Steve House with 1.9 percent.\n\nGardner ran away with the U.S. Senate race straw polling, landing 87.3 percent of caucus-goers\u2019 support. Then came State Senator Owen Hill with 7 percent, and state Senator Randy Baumgardner with 5.1 percent of the vote.\n\nWith reporting by Shelby Kinney-Lang.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Colorado Independent", "description": "\"Who's ready to send Dianne Primavera home?
