Listening to a screeching musical score and a battery of sound effects (moaning, coughing, growls, screams of anguish, mad cackling and such) pulled from any well-designed haunted house helps to further make the skin crawl.\n\nForgive me if I am making \u201cBloodborne\u201d sound impossible to conquer. It\u2019s not, really, but surviving does require a certain tenacity born of patience and respect for an unrelenting enemy. It helps to have a long-term strategy to enhance your hunter\u2019s powers and that will mean constantly dying early on.\n\nBy the way, a player will have time to think through that strategy as every death ends in some excruciating load times with the game before returning to fight again.\n\nNow, a respite from the death cycle occurs as a warrior returns to the Hunter\u2019s Dream using one of the save lanterns (look for the dancing, emaciated souls of the damned popping out of the ground) that are stingily unlocked in locations.\n\nWithin this safe hub, he can spend his accumulated blood echoes (the dripping currency of the game) to replenish health, buy supplies, clothing and weapons. He can talk to an uber-creepy doll to power up attributes and visit the library to store resources and fortify weapons.\n\nHowever, on the down side and take note, the moment a hunter returns to a previously cleansed location from the Dream, those darn creatures repopulate back to kill him.\n\nIt\u2019s worth continuing to note that the learning curve very much favors your avatar dying. I spent more time being hunted than hunting, with enemies jumping out from behind walls, stalking me or waiting to strike as they hid in the distant shadows.\n\nTake my sorry case of getting brutally mauled by a rabid werewolf about a dozen times before understanding how to arm myself with recently acquired weapons. It was a liberating feeling to actually take down an enemy using a massive ax.\n\nWhile on the topic of weapons, they have some slick merit. Let\u2019s ignore the fairly useless guns and focus on the transforming melee weapons. For example, a player can turn his Kirkhammer from a long sword into a more massive mallet sheathed upon a tombstone with the click of the shoulder button.\n\nPlaying the game online opens up some new possibilities and some extras as well.\n\nBesides calling fellow hunters in to help slay particularly difficult monsters (the Darkbeast Paarl comes to mind), players can use coveted chalices to unlock a series of dungeons and, as a trio, work through a new set of diabolical horrors.\n\nPlayers can also take notes in a journal and leave them scattered on the grounds to help fellow hunters that will appear in the environments.\n\nA player can read the notes and rate each positively (if they help) to give the writer a bit of a health boost. This option was a real help to me during the action as in the case of being tipped off that a monster died quicker with fire than being struck.\n\nMore morbidly, recently deceased hunters\u2019 ghosts appear in a red translucent glow when activated near gravestones to reveal more warnings of impending doom.\n\nDespite constantly questioning my sanity while asking myself \u201cam I really this big of a masochist,\u201d \u201cBloodborne\u201d has become a nightmarish addiction. And, be forewarned brave souls, once consumed by its depths, the game can become a life\u2019s work.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Horror meets insane survival in director Hidetaka Miyazaki's latest role-playing video game.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Horror meets insane survival in director Hidetaka Miyazaki\u2019s latest role-playing video game.", "title": "Zadzooks: Bloodborne review", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/apr/4/zadzooks-bloodborne-review/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/04/04/Bloodborne_Tombstone.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/04/04/Bloodborne_Tombstone.jpg", "description": "Horror meets insane survival in director Hidetaka Miyazaki's latest role-playing video game.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Zadzooks: Bloodborne review"}, "Author": "Joseph Szadkowski", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Rom"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda564\"", "article_summary": "Horror meets insane survival within the macabre gaming masterpiece Bloodborne (Sony Computer Entertainment and From Software, Rated Mature, $59.99).\nDespite constantly questioning my sanity while asking myself \u201cam I really this big of a masochist,\u201d \u201cBloodborne\u201d has become a nightmarish addiction.\nMore morbidly, recently deceased hunters\u2019 ghosts appear in a red translucent glow when activated near gravestones to reveal more warnings of impending doom.\nForgive me if I am making \u201cBloodborne\u201d sound impossible to conquer.\nIt was a liberating feeling to actually take down an enemy using a massive ax."}
