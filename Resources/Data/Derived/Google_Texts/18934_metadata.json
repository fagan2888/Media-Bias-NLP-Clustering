Their life expectancy is, on average, 12 years less than those who live elsewhere, the authors found.\n\n\u201cThe results of this study suggest a broadening of the consequences of prejudice to include premature death,\u201d Mark Hatzenbuehler, the lead author of the study and assistant professor of Sociomedical Sciences, said in a press release.\n\nThe researchers began gathering data in 1988, using the General Social Survey, which is one of the major sources of social indicator data in the social sciences. They tried to measure how prejudiced an area was compared to others. They also linked information on sexual orientation and community-level prejudice to mortality data using the National Death Index.\n\nWhen the study was completed, 92 percent of LGB participants who lived in low-prejudice areas were alive, while only 78 percent of those living in high-prejudice areas were alive. \u201cOur findings indicate that sexual minorities living in communities with higher levels of prejudice die sooner than sexual minorities living in low-prejudice communities, and that these effects are independent of established risk factors for mortality, including household income, education, gender, ethnicity, and age, as well as the average income and education level of residents in the communities where the respondents lived,\u201d Hatzenbuehler said in the press release. \u201cIn fact, our results for prejudice were comparable to life expectancy differences that have been observed between individuals with and without a high school education.\u201d\n\nBut what was causing their premature deaths? The authors found that suicide, homicide or violence, as well as cardiovascular disease \u2014 all of which could be associated with stress or mental illness \u2014 were higher among sexual minorities in high-prejudice communities.\n\nThe authors suggest that where homicide and violence-related deaths are elevated, oftentimes the environment is more hostile or prejudiced. Likewise, cardiovascular disease is often associated with stress. Twenty-five percent of deaths among LGB in high-prejudice communities had to do with cardiovascular disease, compared to 18.6 percent elsewhere. \u201cPsychosocial stressors are strongly linked to cardiovascular risk, and this kind of stress may represent an indirect pathway through which prejudice contributes to mortality,\u201d Hatzenbuehler noted in the press release. \u201cDiscrimination, prejudice, and social marginalization create several unique demands on stigmatized individuals that are stress-inducing.\u201d\n\nHatzenbuehler\u2019s previous research has also focused on social stigma and how it affects health, as well as how social environments lead to suicide attempts in LGB youth.\n\nSource: Bellatorre A, Lee Y, Hatzenbuehler M, et al.
