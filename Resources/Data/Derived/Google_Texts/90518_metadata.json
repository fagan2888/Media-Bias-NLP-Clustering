Russia, for example, has \u201crepeatedly demonstrated that it does not respect the sovereignty of its neighbors, and it is willing to use force to achieve its goals\u201d \u2013 a direct reference to President Vladimir Putin\u2019s military support of ethnic Russian rebel forces in eastern Ukraine.\n\n\"Russia's military actions are undermining regional security directly and through proxy forces,\u201d Dempsey wrote in the 2015 National Military Strategy report.\n\nDempsey, 63, an Army four-star general and the 18th chair of the Joint Chiefs, will step down this fall and leave behind a legacy of caution about U.S. military engagement and reliance on local partners in the Middle East and elsewhere. He will be succeeded by Marine Corps commander Gen. Joseph Dunford Jr., who reportedly shares many of Dempsey\u2019s views.\n\nRelated: Most Americans Want Obama to Send Ground Troops to Battle ISIS\n\nAs Defense One noted, the military has been shrinking since 2012 when the Obama administration first announced plans to pivot forces to the Asia-Pacific region as troops withdrew from Afghanistan and Iraq. Since then, however, the president has slowed the Afghanistan withdrawal as fighting there continues and thousands of American military forces have returned to the Middle East and North Africa.\n\nFor now, at least, U.S. forces are not assigned in Iraq to combat roles. But Dempsey and other U.S. commanders have repeatedly warned that it could take decades to defeat ISIS, and many Republicans believe the U.S. ultimately will have no choice but to send in more ground troops to fight ISIS.\n\nHere are five important takeaways from Dempsey\u2019s parting military strategy report:\n\nViolent extremist groups led by al Qaida and the self-proclaimed Islamic State are working to undermine trans-regional security, especially in the Middle East and North Africa. \u201cSuch groups are dedicated to radicalizing populations, spreading violence and leveraging terror to impose their visions of societal organization.\u201d The U.S. military does not have the luxury of focusing on one challenge to the exclusion of others.\n\nRelated: U.S. Shoots Itself in the Foot by Accidentally Arming ISIS\n\nThe military will continue its pivot to the Pacific, but its presence in Europe, the Middle East, Latin America and Africa will evolve. The military must remain \u201cglobally engaged to shape the security environment.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe Russian campaign in Ukraine has military strategists questioning if traditional U.S. military force as it is deployed globally is still enough of deterrence to hybrid and non-state threats. Russia\u2019s military actions are undermining regional security directly and through proxy forces. \u201cIf deterrence fails, at any given time, our military will be capable of defeating a regional adversary in a large-scale, multi-phased campaign while denying the objectives of \u2013 or imposing unacceptable costs on \u2013 another aggressor in a different region.\u201d\n\nIran -- which currently is negotiating a nuclear non-proliferation agreement with the U.S. and others \u2013 also poses strategic challenges to the international community. \u201cIt is pursuing nuclear and missile delivery technologies despite repeated United Nations Security Council resolutions demanding that it cease such efforts.\u201d Moreover, Iran is a state-sponsor of terrorism that has undermined stability in many nations, including Israel, Lebanon, Syria and Yemen.\n\nBeijing is pursuing \u201caggressive land reclamation efforts\u201d in the South China Sea where it is building military bases in on disputed islands. In the same region, on North Korea, \u201cIn time, they will threaten the U.S. homeland,\u201d Dempsey wrote, mentioning Pyongyang\u2019s alleged hack of Sony\u2019s computer network.\n\nTop Reads From The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "In his farewell", "title": "Five Scary Takeaways from Dempsey\u2019s Final Defense Assessment", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/07/03/Five-Scary-Takeaways-Dempsey-s-Final-Defense-Assessment", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/02092013_Dempsey_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/07/03/Five-Scary-Takeaways-Dempsey-s-Final-Defense-Assessment", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/02092013_Dempsey_article.jpg", "creator": "@ericpianin", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "In his farewell", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "\u201cWe must be able to rapidly adapt to new threats while maintaining comparative advantage over traditional ones,\u201d Dempsey wrote.\n\"Russia's military actions are undermining regional security directly and through proxy forces,\u201d Dempsey wrote in the 2015 National Military Strategy report.\nIn the same region, on North Korea, \u201cIn time, they will threaten the U.S. homeland,\u201d Dempsey wrote, mentioning Pyongyang\u2019s alleged hack of Sony\u2019s computer network.\n\u201cToday\u2019s global security environment is the most unpredictable I have seen in 40 years of service,\u201d he wrote in a report released on Wednesday.\nSince then, however, the president has slowed the Afghanistan withdrawal as fighting there continues and thousands of American military forces have returned to the Middle East and North Africa."}
