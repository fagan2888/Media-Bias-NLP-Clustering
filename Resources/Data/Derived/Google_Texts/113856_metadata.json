John Kasich for president this morning.\n\nUnsurprisingly, GOP State Central & Exec Committee votes 44-9 to endorse John Kasich for president. More later @gongwer \u2014 Mikel Livingston (@mikellivingston) January 8, 2016\n\nUnless you\u2019re blissfully unaware of all presidential campaign proceedings, you\u2019ll recall Ohio is hosting this year\u2019s Republican National Convention. Nice of the host state\u2019s GOP to slam its thumb on the scale before the first caucuses and primaries, no?\n\nThe Ohio GOP state central committee voted by paper ballot to endorse the home team governor and then decided to call the 44-9 vote unanimous, because why not.\n\nObviously, this move is meant to boost a flagging \u201cKasich 2016: Because Ohio\u201d campaign in New Hampshire and elsewhere. But in light of Kasich\u2019s poll numbers and the past several years of party maneuvering, the endorsement has the feel of a story arc reaching its zenith.\n\nFoundation for Government Accountability polling has shown Republican primary voters aren\u2019t keen on nominating an Obamacare supporter. This is true even in New Hampshire, where Kasich is struggling to compete with fellow Medicaid-expander Chris Christie.\n\nThe latest RealClearPolitics average for New Hampshire has Kasich behind Trump, Sen. Rubio, Sen. Cruz, and Gov. Christie.\n\nIt seems doubtful that adding an exclamation mark to Kasich\u2019s \u201cBecause Ohio!\u201d tagline will sway many New Hampshire voters. If Kasich doesn\u2019t finish second in New Hampshire, his campaign will be added to the John Weaver campaign dustbin of history.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not as if there was any question which candidate Ohio GOP leadership favored before today, especially after chairman Matt Borges bashed Ohio Treasurer Josh Mandel as a \u201cbit player\u201d when Mandel had the audacity to endorse Rubio last spring.\n\nBefore Kasich officially entered the race, the GOP-controlled Ohio General Assembly passed a bill moving the state\u2019s primary so its delegates would be winner-take-all; many of the state\u2019s elected Republicans have lined up behind Kasich out of loyalty and/or a knowledge that Kasich\u2019s people run the Ohio GOP.\n\nTeam Kasich has held a tight grip on the party\u2019s reins since 2012, when former chairman Kevin DeWine \u2014 cousin of Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine \u2014 and allies were ousted from the central committee.\n\nMany Ohioans (including yours truly) initially viewed this as a positive development, likely to smooth GOP operations during the 2012 cycle while letting Kasich focus on trimming government. Wrong on both counts.\n\nThen again, my criticism of Kasich\u2019s Obamacare expansion long ago unmasked me as an \u201cenemy blogger\u201d who \u201cis known to be anti-Kasich on virtually every issue,\u201d so I\u2019m the wrong guy to be commenting on this.\n\nWhat does everyone think about the Ohio GOP endorsing its own guy a month before Iowa and New Hampshire, and six months before the convention in Cleveland?\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "Thrilling news for the Kung Fu Kasich kampaign", "title": "Ohio Republican Party endorses John Kasich for president", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2016/01/08/ohio-republican-party-endorses-john-kasich-for-president/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary", "creator": "@EdMorrissey"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "article": {"published_time": "2016-01-08T17:41:17+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-01-08T16:51:28+00:00"}, "keywords": "2016, 2016 convention, John Kasich, ohio gop, ohio republican party,", "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2f07\"", "article_summary": "Ohio Republican Party endorses John Kasich for presidentposted at 12:41 pm on January 8, 2016 by Jason HartBreaking from tradition, the Ohio Republican Party voted to formally endorse Gov.\nUnsurprisingly, GOP State Central & Exec Committee votes 44-9 to endorse John Kasich for president.\nJohn Kasich for president this morning.\nNice of the host state\u2019s GOP to slam its thumb on the scale before the first caucuses and primaries, no?\nObviously, this move is meant to boost a flagging \u201cKasich 2016: Because Ohio\u201d campaign in New Hampshire and elsewhere."}
