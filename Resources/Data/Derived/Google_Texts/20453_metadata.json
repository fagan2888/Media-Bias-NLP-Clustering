Luckily, he took down a guard and took a working key card from the unconscious/dead body, surviving the close call. With Raven and Wick's help, he succeeded. But not so fast \u2014 Mount Weather caught on to his plan and found a way to turn in back on.\n\n\n\nHowever, due to the explosion, Mount Weather no longer had the ability to use the fog.
