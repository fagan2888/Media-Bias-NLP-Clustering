Whether or not the field next to Saegert Elementary School becomes a haven for Texas bluebonnets, the students seem to have a stompin’ good time planting seeds.

For the fourth year, the school took part in a bluebonnet stomp Friday, with each class taking a bag of seeds provided by the PTA and placing the tiny bits on the ground before stomping them into the dry earth.

Now, said Saegert PTA secretary Danielle Wade, it’s time to hope for some rain.

The bluebonnet stomp began a scheduled early-release day for the school and all of Killeen ISD and Saegert also held its ninth annual fall festival with a hot dog meal, amusements and even some horses for families to enjoy.

Kindergarten teacher Graciela Young gathered her young children together and handed out the seedlings.

She explained that you stomp the miniature orbs into the ground so the birds wouldn’t come make a snack out of them.

Following the teacher’s lead, children turned the stomp into a dance, jumping and pounding the ground.

“We’re planting bluebonnet seeds,” said Anthony Rodriguez, one of the stomping kindergartners. “You stomp on it.”

He said he hoped “that they grow into bluebonnets.”

Eli Lopez, the school’s new principal this year, said the PTA tradition was meant to beautify the neighborhood and also sparked educational discussion.

“There are a lot of conversations about germination,” she said.

“The goal is to have a field of bluebonnets,” Lopez said. “Students will know they did the work and the neighborhood can use the field for pictures.”

The seed planting also ties in with Texas heritage since the bluebonnet is the state flower of Texas.

The stomp set the stage for the after-school fall festival with hay rides, a dunking booth, bounce houses and horses for children to touch.

“It’s something that‘s fun and free for the families,” Wade said. “The kids get very excited.”
