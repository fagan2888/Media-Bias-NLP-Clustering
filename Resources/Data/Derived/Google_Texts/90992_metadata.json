The Cascades at Southern Hills also has a bus stop and access gates.", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "Tulsa World", "description": "Northstar Properties is one of the larger apartment owners in Oklahoma City\u0097the Norman-based company owns 13 properties with 2,400 units in that metro area.", "title": "Northstar Properties buys two Tulsa apartment complexes", "url": "http://www.tulsaworld.com/business/realestate/northstar-properties-buys-two-tulsa-apartment-complexes/article_e94bd25d-2066-5454-9ff2-053008dcb5bd.html", "image": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/tulsaworld.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/e/8b/e8b87b56-7ac8-11e3-8ca1-001a4bcf6878/52d14ee3c7596.preview-500.jpg?resize=500%2C354", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@tulsaworld", "card": "summary"}, "description": "Northstar Properties is one of the larger apartment owners in Oklahoma City\u0097the Norman-based company owns 13 properties with 2,400 units in that metro area.", "fb": {"app_id": 288003941350366}, "keywords": "properties,hills,northstar,tulsa,apartment,carlson,owners,cascades,company,evatt,realestate,business", "news_keywords": "properties,hills,northstar,tulsa,apartment,carlson,owners,cascades,company,evatt,realestate,business"}, "article_summary": "Northstar Properties is one of the larger apartment owners in Oklahoma City \u0097 the Norman-based company owns 13 properties with 2,400 units in that metro area.\nThe Cascades at Southern Hills also has a bus stop and access gates.\nNorthstar specializes in acquiring older apartment properties, most constructed in the mid-1980s, and keeping them as long-term investments.\nRecently, the company expanded eastward in a big way with the purchase of two Tulsa properties for a combined $22.4 million.\nCascades at Southern Hills was built in 1985, and Coventry Park was built in 1977."}
