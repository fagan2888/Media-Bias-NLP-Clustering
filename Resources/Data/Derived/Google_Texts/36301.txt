Select your county for details on Insure Tennessee

Buy Photo Advocates for Insure Tennessee recently failed to persuade a Senate committee to support the controversial health care plan. Now they’re calling for legislative leaders to bring the measure to the full floor for a vote, a move that’s “impossible,” said House Clerk Joe McCord.

Insure Tennessee would have brought tens of thousands of Tennesseans into the fold of health insurance and made a dent in the amount of charity care provided around the state.

Insure Tennessee is Gov. Bill Haslam's proposed insurance expansion plan using Medicaid funding that was twice defeated in state Senate committees.

A new report from the White House Council of Economic Advisers estimated that Tennessee would have received $1.77 billion in federal money — from a payroll tax people in the state already pay — and saved 220 lives a year if the state had expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act.

Insure Tennessee, which the Haslam administration does not consider traditional Medicaid expansion, is a hot-button issue for supporters and critics alike.

State Democrats recently pushed for a new special session, and health care professionals lament the effects of neglected care. The initiative, which has not gone to a full vote in the General Assembly, faces an uphill battle from a core group of lawmakers who remain opposed.

The Tennessee Hospital Association this year estimated the number of people in each county who would have been eligible for Insure Tennessee.
