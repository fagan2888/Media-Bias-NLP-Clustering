He could have had five goals today,\u201d Trotz said of Ovechkin. \u201cHe was shooting BBs.\u201d\n\nJames Reimer stopped 28 shots for Toronto, which has lost 16 consecutive road games, six by shutout. The Maple Leafs went 0-for-4 on the power play.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve got to be more willing to get on the inside. More willing to get in front of the net, stay there, and get second opportunities,\u201d Toronto coach Peter Horachek said. \u201cIt\u2019s not a secret that when you\u2019re trying to score goals you\u2019ve got to get on the inside.\u201d\n\nWashington took a 1-0 lead when Ovechkin took a pass just inside the blue line, skated into the left circle, and fired a wrist shot past Reimer for Washington\u2019s fastest goal to start a game this season.\n\nThe Capitals had given up the first goal in each of their three loses. By contrast, they improved to 29-1-4 when scoring first.\n\n\u201cI think it was a good response by us, to have a good start,\u201d Ovechkin said. \u201cWe scored a goal and it kind of takes the pressure off.\u201d\n\nThe Capitals made it 2-0 at 5:30 of the second when Reimer stopped Brooks Orpik\u2019s blast from the point, but Ovechkin got the rebound and back-handed it in.\n\nHoltby, meanwhile, thwarted several odd-man rushes, including against Zach Sill on a breakaway late in the second period.\n\nEarly in the third, Toronto\u2019s Richard Panik hit the post on an open-net backhander and slammed his stick into the glass in disgust.\n\n\u201cI thought tonight we were good, just a couple tough bounces against us and a couple of unlucky ones,\u201d Reimer said. \u201cI thought we played another good road game.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Ovechkin scored his 40th and 41st goals of the season and added an assist, Braden Holtby made 32 saves, and the Capitals defeated the Maple Leafs, 4-0, on Sunday night.", "Author": "Harvey Valentine", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Ovechkin scored his 40th and 41st goals of the season and added an assist, Braden Holtby made 32 saves, and the Capitals defeated the Maple Leafs, 4-0, on Sunday night.", "title": "Alex Ovechkin\u2019s two goals help Capitals snap three-game losing streak", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/mar/1/alex-ovechkins-two-goals-help-capitals-snap-three-/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/03/01/180a453ad15290096f0f6a706700c21c.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/03/01/180a453ad15290096f0f6a706700c21c.jpg", "title": "Alex Ovechkin\u2019s two goals help Capitals snap three-game losing s", "description": "Ovechkin scored his 40th and 41st goals of the season and added an assist, Braden Holtby made 32 saves, and the Capitals defeated the Maple Leafs, 4-0, on Sunday night.", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "news_keywords": "Sports, Alexander Ovechkin, Braden Holtby, Toronto Maple Leafs, A James Reimer"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd7c7\"", "article_summary": "Alex Ovechkin\u2019s offensive performance against the Toronto Maple Leafs on Sunday night was impressive.\nOvechkin scored his 40th and 41st goals of the season and added an assist, Braden Holtby made 32 saves, and the Capitals defeated the Toronto Maple Leafs, 4-0, snapping a three-game losing streak.\nMore willing to get in front of the net, stay there, and get second opportunities,\u201d Toronto coach Peter Horachek said.\n\u201cI think it was a good response by us, to have a good start,\u201d Ovechkin said.\n\u201cShot me in the foot.\u201dOvechkin scored in the second period, and Marcus Johansson and Joel Ward, who had an empty-netter, added third-period goals for Washington."}
