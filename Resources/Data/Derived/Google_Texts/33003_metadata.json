The start of greater access to health insurance through the Affordable Care Act may alleviate some of these effects, he said.\n\nVogenberg also expects 2014 will be an active year for mergers and acquisitions.\n\n\u201cBig device companies in the U.S. are finding opportunities for partnerships with startups and established players both in the U.S. and worldwide,\u201d said Vogenberg.\n\nThe global market is showing promise in particular. For example, in October, Minneapolis-based Medtronic, the world\u2019s largest maker of heart rhythm devices, announced a collaboration with India\u2019s Apollo Hospitals. They will collaborate on products to treat kidney damage, with Medtronic investing 1.5 billion rupees ($24 million) in research, development and manufacturing in India.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/news/2014-medical-device-market-lukewarm", "image": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/modules/open_graph/hfn-stacked.jpeg", "site_name": "Healthcare Finance News", "description": "The market will continue to grow, but slowly, while international demand looks promising.", "title": "Medical device market lukewarm in 2014"}, "twitter": {"site": "@HC_Finance", "image": {"src": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/modules/open_graph/hfn-stacked.jpeg"}, "description": "The market will continue to grow, but slowly, while international demand looks promising.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Medical device market lukewarm in 2014"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "2014 is not looking like a banner year for the medical device market \u2013 but it won\u2019t be a loser, either.&#13; \u201cWe believe the outlook for 2014 is not much improved over 2013 \u2013 we expect low, single-digit growth overall,\u201d said Cheryl Richer, director, corporate healthcare for Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s. \u201cHowever, market performance will vary across product segments.\u201d", "viewport": "width=device-width; initial-scale=1.0; maximum-scale=1.0; user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcbc61\"", "article_summary": "According to RnR Market Research, China\u2019s medical device market was valued at $20 billion in 2012 and will grow to $53.5 billion by 2020.\n2014 is not looking like a banner year for the medical device market \u2013 but it won\u2019t be a loser, either.\n\u201cHowever, market performance will vary across product segments.\u201d[See also: Medical device tax goes into effect despite industry objections]For example, Richer said certain segments such as spine or drug eluting stents remain weak while segments such as endovascular, atrial fibrillation and neuromodulation are exhibiting stronger growth.\n\u201cBig device companies in the U.S. are finding opportunities for partnerships with startups and established players both in the U.S. and worldwide,\u201d said Vogenberg.\n\u201cGlobal companies have balanced out weak demand in developed markets for mature products with double-digit growth in emerging markets, and new product introductions that address new patient populations,\u201d said Richer."}
