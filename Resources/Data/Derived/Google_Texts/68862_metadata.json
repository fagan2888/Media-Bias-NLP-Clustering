It didn\u2019t raise or spend a single dollar in all of 2012. When the year ended, it had just $904 in its bank account.\n\nBut its fortunes changed fast in 2013, when six- and seven-figure checks started flowing in to the group, whose listed address is a Louisville post office box. By the end of the year, it had raised nearly $6 million. That money, and at least $8 million more, helped to squash a Democratic challenge to Republican Sen. Mitch McConnell, who was easily reelected this month and is poised to become Senate majority leader.\n\nThe information on the coalition\u2019s finances was contained in a new tax document filed with the Internal Revenue Service and provided to the Los Angeles Times. It shows how the nonprofit organization, all but moribund before last year, quickly grew into one of the biggest \"dark-money\" groups in the 2014 election.\n\nOne donor wrote a $2-million check to the group in 2013, the filing shows. There were two other checks of $500,000 each, and one of $400,000. All told, the organization raised more than $5.9 million in 2013 and spent about $1.2 million, according to the return.\n\nNone of the donors are identified. Like other such politically active nonprofit groups, the coalition has to report the names of big donors to the IRS, but not to the public.\n\nFormed in 2008, the organization\u2019s chairwoman is Kristen Webb, a lawyer and former McConnell intern. She did not return a phone call seeking comment. The group spent money in 2009 fighting a prevailing wage bill for school projects, but went quiet afterward.\n\nIn its initial filing to the IRS in 2008, obtained by the Center for Public Integrity, the group said it did not plan to engage in politics.\n\n------------\n\nFor the Record\n\n9:07 a.m., Nov. 19: An earlier version of this post incorrectly stated that the Center for Investigative Reporting had obtained the Kentucky Opportunity Coalition's 2008 IRS filing. The filing was obtained by the Center for Public Integrity.\n\n------------\n\n\u201cThese sorts of organizations reserve the right to change their mind,\u201d Scott Jennings, the coalition\u2019s advisor, said in an interview. \u201cAnd the initial filing was pre-Citizens United, which obviously changed a lot of things about the world we\u2019re discussing.\u201d\n\nJennings was referring to the Supreme Court decision in the Citizens United case in 2010. That and other decisions cleared the way for unlimited political spending by corporations, and spending by these groups have skyrocketed in their wake.\n\nThe coalition is perhaps the most striking example of a campaign finance trend that blossomed during the 2014 election: outside spending groups, not subject to contribution limits, set up to help one candidate. Critics say such groups allow big-money donors to buy access to politicians in secret.\n\nThere were at least 92 such groups active in 2014, according to the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics. Unlike the coalition, most were political action committees that disclosed their donors.\n\nThe coalition spent more than $14 million on television advertising, starting in 2013, nearly all of it either praising McConnell or attacking his Democratic opponent, Alison Lundergan Grimes. Many of the ads lauded McConnell for helping the state\u2019s coal industry, which it portrayed as under siege by federal environmental regulations. Others attacked the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe week before the Nov. 4. election, the coalition put down $320,000 for television commercials that said Grimes \u201cshould be ashamed of herself\u201d for trying to downplay her ties to President Obama.\n\n\u201cObama needs Grimes. And she\u2019ll say anything to hide it,\u201d the commercial said.\n\nDemocratic outside groups spent money on Grimes\u2019 behalf, but she ended up outspent by McConnell, who won by a wide margin. Grimes, Kentucky\u2019s secretary of state, did not return a request for comment.\n\nOutside groups like the coalition can\u2019t legally coordinate with campaigns. But the coalition and a related \"super PAC,\" Kentuckians for Strong Leadership, have strong ties both to McConnell and to the American Crossroads super PAC run by Karl Rove, advisor to former President George W. Bush. Jennings, who formerly served as McConnell\u2019s political director, is advisor to both groups; Steven Law, Crossroads president and a former McConnell chief of staff, is on the board of Kentuckians for Strong Leadership.\n\nCaleb Crosby, who was paid $13,500 in 2013 as the coalition\u2019s treasurer, also serves as treasurer for American Crossroads.\n\nIn a follow-up email, Jennings said the coalition sprang to life again because \"President Obama's war on coal has galvanized people in our state.\" Asked about the Crossroads connections, Jennings said in an email that the coalition consults with \"a number of other issue advocacy organizations.\"\n\n\"It will continue to be active on issues of concern to Kentuckians,\" he wrote.\n\njoseph.tanfani@latimes.com\n\nTwitter: @jtanfani", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Kentucky 'dark-money' group grew rapidly in 2014 election cycle", "googlebot": "index", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times", "author": "Los Angeles Times", "og": {"site_name": "latimes.com", "description": "The Kentucky Opportunity Coalition, a conservative political nonprofit group, wasn\u2019t very busy before last year.
