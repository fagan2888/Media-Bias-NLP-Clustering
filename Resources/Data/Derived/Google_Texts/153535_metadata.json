The company earned $63 million, or 51 cents per share, a year earlier.\n\nOn an adjusted basis, Centene earned 74 cents per share.\n\nAnalysts on average were expecting a profit of 73 cents per share on revenue of $7.28 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\n\n(Reporting by Amrutha Penumudi in Bengaluru; Editing by Savio D'Souza and Don Sebastian)", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Reuters Editorial", "Author": "Reuters Editorial", "DCSext.PageNumber": 1, "twitter": {"description": "U.S. health insurer Centene Corp (CNC.N) reported a better-than-expected quarterly profit, helped by lower medical costs in certain patient populations and the acquisition of rival Health Net.", "title": "Health insurer Centene's profit beats as medical costs fall", "image": {"src": "http://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png"}, "creator": "@Reuters", "site": "@Reuters", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "DCSext.rChannel": "News", "DCSext.ContentID_gc07": "USKCN0XN14E", "sailthru.tags": "US, CENTENE, RESULTS", "sailthru.title": "Health insurer Centene's profit beats as medical costs fall", "keywords": "US,CENTENE,RESULTS,Managed Healthcare (TRBC),United States,Performance / Results / Earnings,Company News,Healthcare (TRBC),Life and Health Insurance (TRBC),Content produced in Bangalore,English,Corporate Events,Health / Medicine,Results Forecasts / Warnings,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Research (TRBC),Insurance (TRBC)", "DCSext.ContentType": "Article", "news_keywords": "US;CENTENE;RESULTS;Managed Healthcare (TRBC);United States;Performance / Results / Earnings;Company News;Healthcare (TRBC);Life and Health Insurance (TRBC);Content produced in Bangalore;English;Corporate Events;Health / Medicine;Results Forecasts / Warnings;Pharmaceuticals and Medical Research (TRBC);Insurance (TRBC)", "WT.cg_n": "News - Housing", "sailthru.description": "U.S. health insurer Centene Corp (CNC.N) reported a better-than-expected quarterly profit, helped by lower medical costs in certain patient populations and the acquisition of rival Health Net.", "DCSext.ContentChannel": "gc07", "sailthru.date": "2016-04-26T12:10:44+0000", "DCSext.ChannelList": "gc07;everything;Deals;AllianzInvestments;CathayPacific_US;MOC_US_2015-16", "DCSext.ContentHeadline": "Health+insurer+Centene%27s+profit+beats+as+medical+costs+fall", "DCSext.ContentID": "USKCN0XN14E", "WT.cg_s": "gc07", "description": "U.S. health insurer Centene Corp (CNC.N) reported a better-than-expected quarterly profit, helped by lower medical costs in certain patient populations and the acquisition of rival Health Net.", "sailthru.contenttype": "Article", "robots": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "WT.z_inlinetype": "false", "DCSext.rAuthor": "Reuters Editorial", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters"}, "DCSext.rCountry": "BETAUS", "DCSext.DartZone": "us.reuters/world/article", "viewport": "width=1100", "DCSext.PageTotal": 1, "WT.z_navid": "nav-Text-gc07", "site edition": "Reuters", "og": {"site_name": "Reuters", "description": "U.S. health insurer Centene Corp (CNC.N) reported a better-than-expected quarterly profit, helped by lower medical costs in certain patient populations and the acquisition of rival Health Net.", "title": "Health insurer Centene's profit beats as medical costs fall", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "url": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-centene-results-idUSKCN0XN14E", "article": {"section": "News - Housing", "tag": "US,CENTENE,RESULTS,Managed Healthcare (TRBC),United States,Performance / Results / Earnings,Company News,Healthcare (TRBC),Life and Health Insurance (TRBC),Content produced in Bangalore,English,Corporate Events,Health / Medicine,Results Forecasts / Warnings,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Research (TRBC),Insurance (TRBC)", "published_time": "2016-04-26T12:10:44+0000", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T12:10:44+0000", "author": "Reuters Editorial"}, "type": "article"}, "REVISION_DATE": "Tue Apr 26 12:10:44 UTC 2016", "DCSext.contentversion": "original"}, "article_summary": "U.S. health insurer Centene Corp (CNC.N) reported a better-than-expected quarterly profit, helped by lower medical costs in certain patient populations and the acquisition of rival Health Net.\nThe forecast was updated to account for a later close of the Health Net acquisition.\nThe company\u2019s membership increased by 7.1 million to 11.5 million, primarily due to the Health Net acquisition.\nCentene, which closed the Health Net acquisition last month, cut its full-year adjusted earnings forecast to $4.00-$4.35 per share from $4.05-$4.40.\nAnalysts on average were expecting a profit of 73 cents per share on revenue of $7.28 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S."}
