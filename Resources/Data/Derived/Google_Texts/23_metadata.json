Dental hygiene is a significant issue in lower-income communities like South L.A.\n\nWhich is why it was wonderful to see the grand opening of St. John\u2019s Well Child and Family Center\u2019s new Health and Wellness Campus yesterday. The new site, located across the street from their existing clinic on 58th and Hoover, will not only be meeting the medical needs of as many as 30,000 new patients, but will also offer dental care for young children.\n\nWhite House Senior Advisor Valerie Jarrett and Supervisor Mark Ridley-Thomas were both on hand to celebrate the grand opening of the new center, encourage people to enroll in Covered California, and underscore the notion that health care is a right, not a privilege.\n\nWhat I believe makes St. John\u2019s an important community center, however, is not that they can serve so many patients. It is how they do it.\n\nThey have built important partnerships with community organizations active in the area.\n\nYesterday, for example, you could get help signing up for health insurance with Community Coalition, an organization that has actively worked to educate hard-to-reach populations about the Affordable Health Care Act.\n\nIf you wanted to learn about bike safety, staff from the Los Angeles County Bicycle Coalition (LACBC) were there. Colin Bogart, LACBC Education Director, had also recently dropped off a donation of several bikes to the center, as they are looking to launch a bike club for their patients. (If you\u2019re interested in volunteering to help out with monthly maintenance of the bikes, please contact Colin at colin(at)la-bike.org)\n\nCommunity Services Unlimited was also there, offering healthy produce for sale. They normally have a stand there Monday mornings from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m., providing patients with a reliable source of organic produce and offering them the potential of attending gardening and cooking workshops.\n\nBeyond the partnerships, the way St. John\u2019s works to treat the whole patient is key in a community where understanding residents\u2019 daily struggles is important to addressing the root causes of their health problems.\n\nA weekly diabetes class I had the privilege of sitting in on a few times, for example, is comprised of lower-income patients who often scramble to find healthy food in their communities or have few safe spaces to exercise. Some can\u2019t keep food on the table at all when money runs out, and sometimes must make do with carbohydrate- and salt-heavy food bank offerings, despite knowing the damage those foods will do to their systems.\n\nUnderstanding this, the clinic has set up a three-hour class where patients come in early in the morning to get their blood sugar tested, eat a healthy meal together, take part in a group health class led by one or more of their doctors, and exercise together for almost an hour.\n\nIt\u2019s created a friendly environment that feels almost family-like. Older women giggle as they dance zumba together with a wonderful teacher they adore. They practically revel in their ability to move and the progress they are making with their weight loss.\n\nOne woman described how she had not been able to kick her legs when she began the class \u2014 she used to have to lean against the wall to do basic steps. Another pulled out the waistband of her pants to show how much weight she had dropped since she began the class.\n\nWhen they aren\u2019t dancing zumba, they are out walking 58th St., picking up garbage and caring for the tomato and other plants in the parkway garden boxes St. John\u2019s had set up along the length of the street last August. The food grown \u2014 ranging from herbs, to corn, to tomatoes \u2014 was available to the patients or anyone else living in the area who wanted fresh produce.\n\nAlthough many of the boxes have now been filled with flowers to hold the space over til new crops are planted, the example they set has expanded north of the clinic. Boxes distributed to patients living along 57th St. (below) last November are brimming with healthy greens.\n\nEvery time I speak to Lisa Hubbard, Director of Community Health Initiatives at St. John\u2019s, she always seems to have news of some new partnership she is trying to build or program she is trying to expand. She has refused to take credit for programs like the garden boxes, saying they are just drawing inspiration from efforts they are seeing in other communities.\n\nBut, the fact that they are continually trying to find new ways to broaden understandings of health beyond what happens in an exam room with a doctor is a huge boon to South L.A. With the opening of the new health campus, they now have an even greater platform from which to do it.\n\nTo see the new facility, head to 58th and Hoover.
