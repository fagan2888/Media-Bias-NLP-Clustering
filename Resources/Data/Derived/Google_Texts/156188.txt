Donald Trump has finally spoken about his stand on the US health care system. He said he wants to replace the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, with his very own all-inclusive health care plan.

Trump added that he has "something much better" in mind. He indicated on another Twitter post that he would introduce private plans, health savings accounts and encourage freedom of choice for consumers.



During a recent interview CNN's Anderson Cooper via Red State, the 69-year old business magnate said his health care plan will be cheaper than Obamacare. It would mainly target people who don't have the financial means to take care of themselves.



Speaking about his Medicare-based program, Trump explained, "You'll get your doctor, you get everything you want to get, it'll be unbelievable. But you've got to get rid of the lines. You've got to have competition."



The real estate mogul's concepts are heavily borrowed from the Republican blueprint for health care, Slate reported. In Trump's model, Obamacare will be cancelled while health savings accounts will be expanded so that people will have more funds for their medical bills and yearly consultations.



Eligible citizens will be able to purchase insurances across state lines. This provides them the opportunity to shop for the cheapest insurances in each American state.



Politcal analysts believe Trump's stand on US health care doesn't necessarily mean he has become totally entrenched with Republican point of views. This could just be a stratagem by the Trump camp to sway conservative voters to his side.



As of the moment, the latest stat sheet from Real Clear Politics shows Trump leading the GOP nomination race with a rating of 34.2 percent. Texas senator Ted Cruz is currently in second place with a rating of 20.6 percent.
