Ultimately, if they want to pass it, they\u2019re going to ram it down everyone\u2019s throat, and it\u2019s unfortunate. This is over a trillion dollars in spending. It was put together at the last second, as it always happens. They know this has to be done. They wait until December to do it. there\u2019s one provision in the whole thing that\u2019s really important, which is it once takes away the bailout fund for Obamacare, something I was able to achieve in the one last year, and then a bunch of really bad stuff, and you just mentioned one [the bill\u2019s provisions for refugees]. This is why people are so frustrated with Washington. we know that this is a problem, we know that ISIS is trying to use the refugee program to infiltrate killers into the united states and nothing\u2019s going to happen about it. They\u2019re going to approve basically the same program we have today. And people scratch their head and say, how can it be? How can Washington be so out of touch and so disconnected?\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cWe can most certainly slow this process down and force them to go back and make changes to it. There\u2019s no doubt that we can and we should and we will. And I think there\u2019s an effort underway now, among many conservatives in the Senate, and in the House to make that happen. \u2026 Look, this is a massive piece of legislation, over a trillion dollars of spending, It was just announced, and this \u2014 and everyone now has to, in 48 hours, make a decision about what to do about it. I know enough to say we\u2019re going to oppose it, and I know enough to say that we should use every procedural aspect that we have to slow it down and perhaps force some changes on these things that we\u2019ve been discussing.\u201d\n\nRubio concluded, \u201cif we can add some days to it, the way Senator Sessions is talking about, and maybe some others, that process of slowing it down allows more Americans to wake up to the reality of what\u2019s in the bill, and perhaps as a result demand that their elected representatives do something to make those changes on things like the Syrian refugees, which we\u2019re talking about now.\u201d\n\nFollow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett", "article_metadata": {"description": "Rubio: I'll Oppose Omnibus Bill, 'We Should Use Every Procedural Aspect' To Slow It Down and Force Changes", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Rubio: I'll Oppose Omnibus Bill, 'We Should Use Every Procedural Aspect' To Slow It Down and Force Changes", "title": "Rubio: I'll Oppose Omnibus Bill, 'We Should Use Every Procedural Aspect' To Slow It Down and Force Changes - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/12/Rubio-1217-Thumbnail.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/video/2015/12/17/rubio-ill-oppose-omnibus-bill-we-should-use-every-procedural-aspect-to-slow-it-down-and-force-changes/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Rubio: I'll Oppose Omnibus Bill, 'We Should Use Every Procedural Aspect' To Slow It Down and Force Changes", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/12/Rubio-1217-Thumbnail.jpg", "title": "Rubio: I'll Oppose Omnibus Bill, 'We Should Use Every Procedural Aspect' To Slow It Down and Force Changes - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Marco Rubio, omnibus, omnibus bill, Syrian refugees,2016 Presidential Race, Breitbart TV,Rubio", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "2016 Presidential Race", "tag": "Syrian refugees", "published_time": "2015-12-17T12:23:19-07:00", "categories": "Breitbart TV,2016 Presidential Race"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "Ultimately, if they want to pass it, they\u2019re going to ram it down everyone\u2019s throat, and it\u2019s unfortunate.\nHow can Washington be so out of touch and so disconnected?\u201dHe added, \u201cWe can most certainly slow this process down and force them to go back and make changes to it.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERRubio said, \u201cyou can slow it down.\nAnd I think there\u2019s an effort underway now, among many conservatives in the Senate, and in the House to make that happen.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERRepublican presidential candidate Florida Senator Marco Rubio said of the omnibus bill \u201cI know enough to say we\u2019re going to oppose it, and I know enough to say that we should use every procedural aspect that we have to slow it down and perhaps force some changes\u201d on Thursday\u2019s \u201cHappening Now\u201d on the Fox News Channel."}
