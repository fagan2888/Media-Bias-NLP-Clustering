Such plans could have monthly premiums half as much as plans with hospitalization, according to an article in The Washington Post.\n\nThe Post reports minimum value plans without hospitalization have passed muster under an online insurance calculator provided by the US Department of Health and Human Services. Questions arose over whether there was a flaw in the calculator, and now the government appears poised to disallow such plans.\n\nEd Lenz, senior counsel of the American Staffing Association, also says it is likely the Department of Health and Human Services administration will revise its stance and no longer allow health plans without hospitalization to qualify as \u201cminimum value\u201d coverage to avoid the so-called \u201cB\u201d penalties based on full-time employees who receive government subsidies.\n\n\u201cAnything is possible, but all the signs point to a change in the status of those plans,\u201d Lenz said. \u201cI would certainly caution, and we are cautioning our members, not to count on those plans qualifying as minimum value in 2015.\u201d\n\nNo official announcement has come, and it might not come until after the November election \u2014 leaving precious little time for staffing firms to make changes. However, it\u2019s hoped the administration would allow transition relief given the late date; Lenz said it would be unconscionable for the administration not to do so.\n\nThe question is a concern because large employers must offer coverage beginning Jan. 1 or potentially be exposed to penalties. Large employers are defined as companies with 50 or more full-time employees and/or full-time equivalents. (However, employers with 50 to 99 full-time employees and equivalents won\u2019t face the employer mandate in 2015 if they meet certain conditions.)\n\nThe nearness of the law\u2019s employer mandate and its complexity also made it a popular topic at the American Staffing Association\u2019s Staffing World conference held last week in the Washington area. Staffing firm executives peppered experts with questions and talks on the ACA drew large audiences.\n\nExperts at the conference broke the penalties down to \u201cA\u201d and \u201cB\u201d penalties.\n\nThe \u201cA\u201d penalty is $2,000 per year multiplied by all of a company\u2019s full-time workers (not full-time equivalents). This penalty will be faced by companies that don\u2019t offer any health insurance at all to 95 percent of their full-time employees (70 percent in 2015 under transition relief). Staffing firms can avoid the \u201cA\u201d penalty by offering a \u201cminimum essential coverage\u201d (MEC) plan \u2014 which are not in question. These \u201cskinny\u201d plans typically offer only preventive care, a specified number of doctor visits per year and, in some cases, generic prescription drugs. They don\u2019t cover hospital stays, surgical procedures or prenatal care. MEC plans are projected to cost $40 to $100 per month, according to Staffing Industry Analysts.\n\nThe \u201cB\u201d penalty is $3,000 times each full-time employee who receives a subsidy to buy health insurance through an exchange. An employer faces this penalty if the coverage it offers is neither affordable nor meets minimum value. A plan must not exceed 9.5 percent of an employee\u2019s household income in order to be considered affordable, but employers can make that determination based on a worker\u2019s W-2 wages.\n\nEven if transition relief is not granted, Lenz said, there would be disruption, but no immediate penalty impact. Penalties next year will be determined assessed on a month-by-month basis and won\u2019t be assessed by the IRS come payable until 2016 \u2014 giving insurers time to come up with replacements for the no-hospitalization plans early in 2015.\n\nGeorge Reardon, an attorney who specializes in the staffing industry, said in a prepared comment that the controversy over MVPs represents a struggle over ACA compliance philosophy:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s unclear whether the opportunity for omitting hospitalization from a minimum value plan arose because of a policy misstep, a programming bug or an actuarial methods issue. However it arose, Treasury officials are na\u00efve for not expecting employers to seek the lowest cost compliance strategies, of which the MVP plan is the latest. Treasury is again acting \u2018shocked, shocked,\u2019 the way it did two years ago when the amazingly undemanding definition of \u2018minimum essential coverage\u2019 was discovered and \u2018skinny\u2019 plans became the rage.\n\n\u201cIn 2013, ASA committed the entire staffing industry to comply with the intent and spirit of ACA in addition to the letter of ACA. Yet most staffing firms have enthusiastically embraced MEC plans, MVP plans, and hours and tenure limits under a no-plan strategy \u2014 all of which are designed to legally minimize ACA coverage and penalty costs. ASA\u2019s benefits counsel recently blogged that \u2018No employer is required to do anything more than the law requires; and any employer that does risks putting itself at a competitive disadvantage relative to those that do not.\u2019 I agree with him and said virtually the same thing in 2013.\n\n\u201cThe government never changed the MEC definition, but it sounds determined to amend the MV rules and calculator. We may also see it go back to readdress the MEC definition. Ironically, the cost of stricter ACA coverage requirements may force staffing firms to drop or downgrade their anticipated coverage offers.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "ACA, Affordable Care Act, temporary staffing", "MSSmartTagsPreventParsing": "TRUE", "description": "The federal government may disallow a type of healthcare plan that cuts costs and allows staffing firms to avoid penalties under the Affordable Care Act when employer mandates take effect next year.", "generator": "eZ Publish"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1869\"", "article_summary": "Home \u00bbEditorial \u00bbDaily News \u00bbFeds will likely cut \u2018minimum value\u2019 health plans without hospitalization under ACADaily News View All NewsFeds will likely cut \u2018minimum value\u2019 health plans without hospitalization under ACAOctober 21 2014The federal government may disallow a type of healthcare plan that cuts costs and allows staffing firms to avoid penalties under the Affordable Care Act when employer mandates take effect next year.\nIn question are \u201cminimum value plans\u201d (MVP) that don\u2019t cover in-patient hospital costs.\nThe Post reports minimum value plans without hospitalization have passed muster under an online insurance calculator provided by the US Department of Health and Human Services.\nSuch plans could have monthly premiums half as much as plans with hospitalization, according to an article in The Washington Post.\nAn employer faces this penalty if the coverage it offers is neither affordable nor meets minimum value."}
