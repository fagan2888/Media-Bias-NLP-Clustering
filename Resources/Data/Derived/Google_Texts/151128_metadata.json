Together they will lead the party\u2019s grassroots organizing efforts.\n\nThe two positions have similar functions and work collaboratively, said Meredith Tucker, the party\u2019s communications director. The field director focuses on participation at the grassroots level, developing strategies to bolster participation and voter turnout. The political director works with county parties, outside organizations that support the ODP and other activists in a similar fashion.\n\nSisneros previously oversaw nine states as deputy national regional director for Organizing for Action, the successor to the Obama re-election campaign. It is a non-profit social action organization formed in 2013 following Obama\u2019s re-election.\n\nHe previously was a deputy field director for the Obama re-election campaign in Nevada.\n\nDevezin, a native of Shaker Heights, was a regional field director for Obama\u2019s re-election campaign. Previously he worked on the Cleveland Public Library\u2019s levy renewal campaign and also has experience working with Planned Parenthood\u2019s Affordable Care Act program in Cleveland.\n\nHe worked for the Ohio Democratic Party in 2010 as a field organizer.", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "elections-2014,meredith-tucker,ohio-democratic-party,voter-turnout", "title": "Ohio Democratic Party adds staff to bolster grassroots support, turnout efforts", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Ohio Democratic Party adds staff to bolster grassroots support, turnout efforts\", \"link\": \"http://www.cleveland.com/open/index.ssf/2014/04/democratic_party_adds_staff_to.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://imgick.cleveland.com/home/cleve-media/width620/img/open_impact/photo/14411642-standard.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"12579530\", \"pub_date\": \"2014-04-03T19:34:44Z\", \"author\": \"Robert Higgs, Northeast Ohio Media Group Columbus bureau chief\", \"tags\": [\"@mobile\",\"elections-2014\",\"meredith-tucker\",\"ohio-democratic-party\",\"voter-turnout\"] }", "twitter": {"image": "http://media.cleveland.com/open_impact/photo/14411642-thumb_square_large.jpg", "creator": "@RHiggsPD", "site": "@clevelanddotcom", "card": "summary", "description": "The new staffers both had experience with President Barack Obama's re-election campaign."}, "article_date_updated": "Thursday, April 03, 2014,  4:03 PM", "parsely-metadata": "{\"image_url\": \"http://media.cleveland.com/open_impact/photo/fitzgerald-signsjpg-4a55c9ddb41dd0a8.jpg\", \"author_name\": \"RHiggs\", \"author_nickname\": \"Robert Higgs, Northeast Ohio Media Group Columbus bureau chief\", \"author_id\": \"2184\", \"source_blog_name\": \"OPEN: Ohio Politics\", \"source_blog_url\": \"http://www.cleveland.com/open/index.ssf/\", \"sponsored_content\": \"0\" }", "og": {"site_name": "cleveland.com", "description": "The new staffers both had experience with President Barack Obama's re-election campaign.", "title": "Ohio Democratic Party adds staff to bolster grassroots support, turnout efforts", "url": "http://www.cleveland.com/open/index.ssf/2014/04/democratic_party_adds_staff_to.html", "image": "http://media.cleveland.com/design/alpha/img/logo_cleve.gif", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "cleveland.com", "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Thursday, April 03, 2014,  3:45 PM", "article_author": "Robert Higgs, Northeast Ohio Media Group Columbus bureau chief", "Description": "The new staffers both had experience with President Barack Obama's re-election campaign."}, "article_summary": "The field director focuses on participation at the grassroots level, developing strategies to bolster participation and voter turnout.\nCOLUMBUS, Ohio -- The Ohio Democratic Party has added two people who had roles in President Barack Obama\u2019s re-election campaign to focus on energizing the base and getting out the vote.\nThe party announced Steve Sisneros as its new field director and Nelson Devezin as its new political director.\nDevezin, a native of Shaker Heights, was a regional field director for Obama\u2019s re-election campaign.\nIt is a non-profit social action organization formed in 2013 following Obama\u2019s re-election."}
