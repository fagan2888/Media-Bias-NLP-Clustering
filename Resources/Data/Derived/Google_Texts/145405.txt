Every PayNearMe Receipt Generated at U.S. 7-Eleven Locations Encourages Sign Up for Health Insurance Coverage

WASHINGTON, DC--(Marketwired - December 11, 2014) - To reach more Americans this open enrollment season, Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell announced a first-of-its-kind partnership between the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the electronic cash transactions company PayNearMe to reach financially underserved and other cash-preferring consumers.

"Leveraging developments from technology companies like PayNearMe helps us to reach our consumers where they are, with the information they need to sign up and re-enroll in quality, affordable care through the Health Insurance Marketplace," said HHS Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell. "With this partnership, we are using digital platforms to place Open Enrollment information in the hands of consumers who need it."

During this year's Open Enrollment period, all PayNearMe receipts printed at 7,800 7-Eleven stores nationwide will include a special announcement that informs consumers about upcoming Affordable Care Act deadlines and encourages them to explore beneficial options such as tax credits and newly available plans at HealthCare.gov.

Putting these reminders at the bottom of PayNearMe receipts will help get health coverage information into the hands of traditionally hard-to-reach consumers. Because PayNearMe receipts serve as a consumer's proof of payment for important items such as rent, loans and utilities, they are more likely to be inspected and retained than a traditional receipt.

In addition to rent, loans and utilities, PayNearMe also allows cash-preferring consumers to pay with cash for online purchases and more at participating 7-Eleven stores and other retail stores across the U.S. Once a payment is accepted, the business being paid is notified immediately and the consumer receives a receipt as proof of payment.

Secretary Burwell joined PayNearMe and 7-Eleven, Inc. leadership today in announcing the partnership at a 7-Eleven store in Washington D.C., where PayNearMe demonstrated how consumers would receive receipts printed with information on Open Enrollment.

"Banked or unbanked, cash or plastic -- no matter what your preference, everyone can benefit from affordable health care," said Danny Shader, PayNearMe's founder and chief executive officer. "By partnering with the Department of Health and Human Services, we can help generate awareness of this open enrollment process among consumers."
