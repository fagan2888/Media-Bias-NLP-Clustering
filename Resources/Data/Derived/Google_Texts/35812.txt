Gardening expert Bill Finch is in the Smithsonian! (The magazine, that is…)

This month’s edition of the Smithsonian is featuring Bill’s article on Kudzu; it explodes some of the many myths about “The Green Monster.”

Bill says kudzu was never as big of a deal that it was made out to be, and it’s getting harder and harder to find! It’s most common along southern roadsides, but once you go deeper into the woods, it disappears entirely.

Myth number one is that kudzu is impossible to get rid of. Bill says anyone who has cows or horses or goats has no kudzu problem. Turn those animals loose on a field of kudzu and it’s gone in a year. Kudzu only thrives where grazers can’t go.

But there’s a new type of grazer in town that Bill talks about in his article. It’s called—appropriately enough—the kudzu bug. Bill says it smells like a combination of grape Kool-aid and stinkbug, and it LOVES kudzu.

The kudzu bug isn’t eating ALL the kudzu, but Bill says it eats enough that other weeds start out-competing the kudzu in the places where it once thrived.
