In effect, the legislation would eventually double the government\u2019s annual spending for those services.\n\nFor now, Congress is treating the alternative private care provision as short term, designed to be phased out by 2016 when the planned expansion of VA medical staff is completed. However, Congress will likely come under pressure from veterans groups and others to make the private care alternative permanent \u2013 with serious budgetary implications.\n\nThe Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a government-spending watchdog, says that if the program were permanently extended, fully phased in and adjusted for inflation, the overall cost would exceed $500 billion in the next decade.\n\nRelated: Shinseki Falls on Sword in VA Scandal\n\n\u201cThe provision could create an entitlement bigger than Medicare Part D when it was enacted,\u201d the group said in a new analysis. \u201cFor the cost of making this new entitlement permanent, policy makers could fully repeal the defense sequester.\u201d\n\nSenate Veterans Affairs Committee Chairman Bernie Sanders (I-VT) and Sen. John McCain (R-AZ), the chief authors of the legislation, said last week that the government has a moral obligation to do all it can for those who have served the country.\n\n\u201cIf anyone disagrees with taking care of veterans, they shouldn\u2019t send them off to war in the first place,\u201d Sanders told The Washington Post.\n\nSen. Jeff Sessions of Alabama \u2013 one of only three Senate Republicans who opposed the measure on the final vote \u2013 said he was concerned Congress was breaching existing budget constraints and adding to the deficit by declaring \u201cemergency\u201d conditions, MSNBC reported.\n\nRelated: Lots of Ideas, No Quick Fix for VA Health Care\n\n\u201cThere are some good things in the bill,\u201d said Sessions, the ranking Republican on the Senate Budget Committee, according to the report. \u201cBut \u2026 I cannot suggest to my colleagues that the budget violations now before us should be waived. They should not.\u201d\n\nCongress has declared \u201cemergencies\u201d over the years to fund hurricane disaster relief, drought, massive flooding and other calamities by adding to the deficit instead of seeking offsetting cuts elsewhere. The Senate had to vote to waive so-called pay-go rules to approve the bill without offset cuts \u2013 something 19 Republicans voted against.\n\nUsually, bills granting an agency new authority are left to the Appropriations Committee to determine how much to spend. In this case, the VA legislation grants an unlimited mandatory appropriation designated as \u201csuch sums as are necessary.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat spending would proceed automatically without any further action by Congress or oversight from the Appropriations Committee,\u201d according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget analysis.\n\n\u201cThe \u2018emergency\u2019 designation is for sudden, unforeseen, and temporary needs \u2013 none of which define this situation \u2013 not a tool for politicians who are unwilling to pay the bills,\u201d said CRFB president Maya MacGuineas in a statement. \u201cWashington is once again looking for the easy way out.\u201d\n\nBecause Congress has moved so quickly to pass legislation and get it to President Obama, CBO had little time to evaluate the bill\u2019s long-term cost.\n\nCBO said in its preliminary report that \u201cthe magnitude of the budgetary effects of the bill is highly uncertain\u201d and that \u201ca significant number of veterans could receive new and expanded health care benefits\u201d under the proposed law.\n\n\u201cThe VA currently has about 8.4 million veterans enrolled in its health care program,\u201d said CBO. \u201cOf the remaining 13 million veterans, CBO estimates that about eight million qualify to enroll in VA\u2019s health care program but have not\u201d done so.\n\nRelated: VA Scandal Exposes Single-Payer Health Care Flaws\n\n\u201cCBO expects that some of those people will choose to enroll because of the improvement in access to health care through VA,\u201d the report continued. \u201cMost of the costs incurred to provide that care would be for care financed by other payers, including Medicare.\u201d\n\nThe VA wait list scandal has prompted swift bipartisan action by Congress like few other issues in recent memory. The controversy led to the resignation of VA Secretary Eric Shinseki and the firing of other senior officials. The scandal first erupted after reports by CNN that at least 40 U.S. veterans might have died while waiting for medical appointments through a VA facility in Phoenix.\n\nIt was later discovered that more than 100,000 veterans nationwide were kept off waiting lists for medical appointments. Acting VA Secretary Sloan Gibson disclosed that at least 18 Arizona veterans died while awaiting doctor appointments, though it was unclear if those deaths were directly related to the long waits, USA Today reported.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Congress and the White House are rushing to enact legislation to end the long waiting lists at VA medical centers and to make amends for a patient scheduling scandal that may have contributed to at least 40 deaths in Phoenix.
