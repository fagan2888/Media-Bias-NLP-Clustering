When he looked at a fact sheet on the fund, however, the company listed its total expense ratio at 6.16%. Even the fund\u2019s net expense ratio was 3.95%.\n\n\u201cI think somebody has to be wrong here,\u201d Steve wrote. \u201cEither [MarketWatch] has it wrong or the fund does. \u2026 Expenses should be easy enough to calculate and get right.\u201d\n\nBut they\u2019re not \u2014 and both numbers can indeed be correct \u2014 because when it comes to alt funds, calculating the expense ratio is quirky. With alternatives being the hot asset class, knowing why the numbers are different and what they mean will, at the very least, make you a better consumer investor.\n\nTraditionally, a fund\u2019s expense ratio includes the management fee and the costs associated with running the money, but it excludes transaction costs like brokerage and transaction fees. If a fund has high turnover and trades all the time, those costs are paid by the fund, but they are not a part of the expense ratio.\n\nLove locks removed from bridge in Paris (1:09) The weight of love is taking its toll on the Pont des Arts fences in Paris. On Monday, city officials began to remove the famed love locks because of safety concerns.\n\nIdeally, the expense ratio covers fees with a direct connection to investment returns; cutting costs should increase shareholder returns by the same amount.\n\nInvestment-related expenses like brokerage costs can be avoided or cut, but doing so won\u2019t automatically increase returns. If a high-turnover fund stops trading so much \u2014 cutting trading costs \u2014 the fund\u2019s results are completely different.\n\nAlternative funds \u2014 especially those using an investment strategy called short-selling \u2014 have a lot of those investment-related expenses.\n\nIn a short sale, the investor (in this case a fund manager) is betting against a stock, borrowing shares to sell at the current market price. If the stock price drops, the investor buys back the shares and returns them, pocketing the difference in price.\n\nThere\u2019s a cost for borrowing the shares, like any other loan. Further, when a company pays a dividend, the short-seller \u2014 who doesn\u2019t actually own the shares \u2014 actually must pay the dividend out to whoever loaned the shares.\n\nThat payment gets reported as an \u201cexpense,\u201d and therefore becomes a part of the expense ratio, in the eyes of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and, therefore, on the fund\u2019s documents.\n\nRatings agencies like Lipper Inc. \u2014 which MarketWatch uses to report fund data \u2014 and Morningstar Inc. pull the investment-related costs out and come up with their own expense number.\n\nThat\u2019s how TFS Market Neutral TFSMX, -0.73% \u2014 which faces heavy borrowing costs because the small-company stocks it trades in are less liquid than the big names \u2014 show an expense ratio on their website of more than 8%, about four times higher than what Lipper and Morningstar say investors are paying.\n\nConsider that the TFS site reports an expense ratio higher than that of the Cognios fund, but that adjusted ratio reported by the research firms is lower. The way these numbers play out isn\u2019t always intuitive, which makes it hard on investors.\n\nJeff Tjornehoj, head of Americas Research for Lipper, said that the firm excludes investment-related expenses \u201cbecause those were only incurred based on how the fund invested.\u201d In that way, they\u2019re like transaction costs and brokerage commissions, which don\u2019t belong in the expense ratio.\n\nSaid Tjornehoj: \u201cIt would not be fair to say \u2018I would have received X% more if the fund hadn\u2019t incurred those expenses\u2019 because those returns were only possible by creating those expenses. It\u2019s not like an expensive management fee that could, in theory, be reduced to zero and returns would be improved by that amount. In this case, returns were solely made possible by incurring investment-related expenses like short interest.\u201d\n\nIn other words, to avoid short interest and dividend repayments, a fund would have to stop short-selling, which would pretty much put an end to the idea that it\u2019s an \u201calternative fund.\u201d\n\nAlt funds do have to overcome those costs, the same way a high-turnover fund must cover the burden of additional transaction costs, but that\u2019s part of the strategy. It\u2019s something managers plan for; a short-seller would never make a trade if they didn\u2019t think the stock would decline enough to make their profit \u2014 after all costs \u2014 worthwhile.\n\nThe Cognios fund, for example, is up more than 10% in the last year, near the top of its peer group, while the TFS fund has gained more than 7% per year, on average, since it opened in 2004. Those are pretty good numbers, achieved regardless of the expense ratio.\n\nBut if you are going to use alternative funds, at least look at the gross expense ratio listed in the fund documents and compare it to the raters\u2019 numbers, just to see how big a burden the fund managers are willing to take on, because that\u2019s your money they are playing with.\n\nMore from MarketWatch", "article_metadata": {"lifp_basePath": "https://id.marketwatch.com/access", "twitter": {"domain": "marketwatch.com", "description": "One of the dirty secrets about \u201calternative-strategy mutual funds\u201d is that there are alternative ways to calculate a fund\u2019s expense ratio, writes Chuck Jaffe.", "creator": "@MKTWJaffe", "image": {"width": 1320, "identifier": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-DM582_confus_ZG_20150522163248.jpg", "height": 742}, "site": {"id": 624413}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "parsely-author": "Chuck Jaffe", "article.content_group": "marketwatch", "article.section": "Personal Finance", "parsely-type": "post", "description": "One of the dirty secrets about \u201calternative-strategy mutual funds\u201d is that there are alternative ways to calculate a fund\u2019s expense ratio, writes Chuck Jaffe.", "parsely-link": "http://www.marketwatch.com/story/alternative-way-to-figure-fund-costs-confuses-investors-2015-06-02", "author": "Chuck Jaffe", "parsely-title": "\u2018Alternative\u2019 way to figure fund costs confuses investors", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=336693422", "parsely-pub-date": "2015-06-02T06:09:00-04:00", "page.site": "marketwatch", "robots": "noarchive,noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 283204329838}, "parsely-section": "MW_Personal Finance", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/marketwatch"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "og": {"site_name": "MarketWatch", "description": "One of the dirty secrets about \u201calternative-strategy mutual funds\u201d is that there are alternative ways to calculate a fund\u2019s expense ratio, writes Chuck Jaffe.", "title": "\u2018Alternative\u2019 way to figure fund costs confuses investors", "url": "http://www.marketwatch.com/story/alternative-way-to-figure-fund-costs-confuses-investors-2015-06-02", "image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-DM582_confus_ZG_20150522163248.jpg", "type": "article"}, "ob": {"image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-DM582_confus_ZG_20150522163248.jpg"}, "article.id": "B111178C-089B-11E5-9637-169434F085E8", "position": 1}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc626\"", "article_summary": "One of the dirty secrets about \u201calternative-strategy mutual funds\u201d is that there are alternative ways to calculate a fund\u2019s expense ratio.\nTraditionally, a fund\u2019s expense ratio includes the management fee and the costs associated with running the money, but it excludes transaction costs like brokerage and transaction fees.\nWhen he reviewed Cognios Market Neutral Large Cap COGMX, -0.40% at MarketWatch.com, he saw a \u201ctotal expense ratio\u201d of 2.25%.\nWhen he looked at a fact sheet on the fund, however, the company listed its total expense ratio at 6.16%.\nIf a fund has high turnover and trades all the time, those costs are paid by the fund, but they are not a part of the expense ratio."}
