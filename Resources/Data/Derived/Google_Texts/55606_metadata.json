Paul Wszolek said.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ll be back again around 8:30 or 9 a.m. Sunday to search again,\u201d he said.\n\nSheridan Police were called to the river around 4:30 p.m. Witnesses said they saw the man surface and go under several times as he was swept north of where the river passes under West Union Avenue in Sheridan.\n\nHe was last seen floating in the river about a quarter mile north of Union.\n\n\u201cPeople were trying to get to him, but the water was too fast,\u201d Sheridan Police Chief Mark Campbell said.\n\nThe man was one of four people trying to float the river. The three other tubers got out of the river.\n\nRescue crews combed the banks of the river and were using a line strung between two firetrucks flanking the river in a stretch between Union Chutes and Hollywood Hole to aid their search.\n\nRescuers from the Sheridan Police, Denver Fire, Englewood Police, Arapahoe County Sheriff, Denver Police and Arapahoe Rescue Patrol departments were looking for the man. Denver\u2019s Air 1 police helicopter also was used.\n\nThe rescuers were focused on an area that is popular with kayakers and tubers during ordinary river conditions. However, when the water is high, the area is treacherous.\n\nAt 6 p.m. Saturday, the South Platte was flowing at 3,660 cubic feet per second at Englewood, according to the U.S. Geological Service water data site. Most experienced kayakers consider anything above 600 cfs in the area to be challenging.\n\nEarlier this weekend, USGS hydrologic technician Sue Hartley said the recent rainfall has created some of the highest water levels seen in Colorado since 1995.\n\nRainfall caused water levels to rise \u2014 Clear Creek was running at 2,000 cfs Friday, enough to fill an Olympic-size swimming pool in 45 seconds \u2014 but experts are now focusing on snowmelt, which Hartley says could bump up rivers and creeks this weekend.\n\nHartley said many people lack experience with fast water. The combination of inexperience, rushing flow and debris creates dangerous conditions.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Search for tuber swept away by raging S.
