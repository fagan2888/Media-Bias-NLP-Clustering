Eat this! Don\u2019t eat that! We obsess about the properties of various ingredients: the protein, the omega oils, the vitamins. But this is getting ahead of ourselves. Nutrients only count when a person picks up food and eats it. How we eat\u2014how we approach food\u2014is what really matters. If we are going to change our diets, we first have to relearn the art of eating, which is a question of psychology as much as nutrition. We have to find a way to want to eat what\u2019s good for us.\n\nOur tastes follow us around like a comforting shadow. They seem to tell us who we are. Maybe this is why we act as if our core attitudes to eating are set in stone. We make frequent attempts\u2014more or less half-hearted\u2014to change what we eat, but almost no effort to change how we feel about food: how well we deal with hunger, how strongly attached we are to sugar, our emotions on being served a small portion. We try to eat more vegetables, but we do not try to make ourselves enjoy vegetables more, maybe because there\u2019s a near-universal conviction that it is not possible to learn new tastes and shed old ones. Yet nothing could be further from the truth.\n\nAll the foods that you regularly eat are ones that you learned to eat. Everyone starts life drinking milk. After that, it\u2019s all up for grabs.\n\nBone marrow from wild game is considered the best first baby food among the hunting tribes of Tanzania. If you were born in the Far Eastern republic of Laos, it could be gelatinous rice, pre-chewed by your mother and transferred from her mouth to yours (this is sometimes called kiss-feeding). For Western babies, that first bite of solid food may be powdered cereal from a packet or puree from a jar; it could be organic pumpkin, steamed and strained and served with a hypoallergenic spoon; or a random nibble from a parent\u2019s plate. Aside from milk, there is simply no such thing as a universal food. Not even for babies.\n\nFrom our first year of life, human tastes are astonishingly diverse. As omnivores, we have no inbuilt knowledge of which foods are good and safe. Each of us has to use our senses to figure out for ourselves what is edible, depending on what\u2019s available. In many ways, this is a delightful opportunity. It\u2019s the reason there are such fabulously varied ways of cooking in the world.\n\nBut we haven\u2019t paid anything like enough attention to another consequence of being omnivores, which is that eating is not something we are born instinctively knowing how to do, like breathing. It is something we learn. A parent feeding a baby is training him or her how food should taste. At the most basic level, we have to learn what is food and what is poison. We have to learn how to satisfy our hunger and also when to stop eating. Unlike the anteater, which eats only small termites, we have few natural instincts to fall back on. Out of all the choices available to us as omnivores, we have to figure out which foods are likable, which are lovable, and which are disgusting. From these preferences, we create our own pattern of eating, as distinctive as a signature.\n\nOr that\u2019s how it used to be. In today\u2019s food culture, many people seem to have acquired uncannily homogeneous tastes, markedly more so than in the past. In 2010, two consumer scientists argued that the taste preferences of childhood provided a new way of thinking about the causes of obesity. They noted a \u201cself-perpetuating cycle\u201d: food companies push foods high in sugar, fat, and salt, which means that children learn to like them, and so the companies invent ever more of these foods \u201cthat contribute to unhealthy eating habits.\u201d The main influence on a child\u2019s palate may no longer be a parent but a series of food manufacturers whose products\u2014despite their illusion of infinite choice\u2014 deliver a monotonous flavor hit quite unlike the more varied flavors of traditional cuisine.\n\nI went to the cinema with one of my children recently. We stood at the ice cream concession and I realized, with a jolt, that almost all of the options\u2014other than plain vanilla\u2014contained chocolate in one form or another. Would we pick mint chocolate chunk or cherry chocolate chunk or chocolate ice cream with chocolate brownie pieces or caramel ice cream with pieces of caramel chocolate? The danger of growing up surrounded by these endless sweet and salty industrial concoctions is not that we are innately incapable of resisting them, but that the more frequently we eat them, especially in childhood, the more they train us to expect all food to taste this way.\n\nOnce you recognize the simple fact that food preferences are learned, many of the ways we currently approach eating start to look a little weird. To take a small example, consider the parents who go to great lengths to \u201chide\u201d vegetables in children\u2019s meals. Is broccoli really so terrible that it must be concealed from innocent minds? Whole cookbooks have been devoted to this arcane pursuit. It starts with the notion that children have an innate resistance to vegetables, and will only swallow them unawares, blitzed into pasta sauce or baked into sweet treats; they could never learn to love zucchini for its own sake. In our harried, sleep-deprived state, as parents we find it hard to play the long game. We think we are being clever when we smuggle some beets into a cake. Ha! Tricked you into eating root vegetables! But since our children are not conscious that they are consuming beets, the main upshot is to entrench their liking for cake. A far cleverer thing would be to help children learn to become adults who choose vegetables consciously, of their own accord.", "article_metadata": {"description": "We sneak veggies into kids' meals.
