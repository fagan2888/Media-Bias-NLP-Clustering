Steve Farley, D-Tucson, who joined McNabb and state Sen. Anna Tovar, D-Tolleson, on the conference call, accused Republicans of attacking the health care law \u201csimply because they don\u2019t like the president.\u201d\n\nTovar said she had to \u201cstruggle and fight\u201d for coverage after she was treated for cancer 11 years ago, but said the new law offers \u201cpeace of mind\u201d for people with pre-existing conditions.\n\n\u201cThankfully, today with the affordable healthcare act, many patients will not have to go through\u201d what she went through, Tovar said.\n\nMcNabb was one of those people. Limited to costly insurance because she had been prescribed blood pressure medications, McNabb said she was able to find coverage under the new law that she likes better. It will cost her $500 in monthly premiums, compared to the $357 a month she pays now, but she will have better coverage and a deductible of $1,500 \u2013 down from $7,500 now.\n\n\u201cMy total out-of-pocket expenses are limited to $4,000 as opposed to $10,500 with my current policy,\u201d she said. \u201cIf I compare my new policy to my old policy, I\u2019m actually saving potentially about 30 percent \u2026 so I am just beaming.\u201d\n\nMcNabb admitted the online marketplace was still \u201ckludgy\u201d when she signed on, but that she just sat watching television and waiting patiently for each page to load.\n\nHow many Arizonans have been able to register or enroll through the online marketplace is unclear. Some insurers said they are seeing enrollments online in \u201cpainfully small numbers,\u201d and others say it\u2019s too early to release enrollment numbers.\n\nOne of those offering coverage on the federal exchange, Meritus Health Partners, has had 12 people enroll, said CEO Kathleen Oestreich. Many others are interested, she said, but because they are eligible for federal subsidies they cannot enroll until the website begins working properly.\n\n\u201cThe good news is we\u2019re getting files with accurate data,\u201d Oestreich said. \u201cIt tells us the system works from end to end, it\u2019s just slow.\u201d\n\nOestreich said she worries that if the site takes too long to be fixed, people will lose patience and won\u2019t sign up. Interest has already fallen off a little since early October, she said.\n\nBut Oestreich also said she did not expect an \u201cavalanche\u201d of enrollments in October because customers would still be mulling their options.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a tremendous amount of competition, so for the consumer it\u2019s even a lot more work because they have a lot more choices and a lot more comparing to do,\u201d Oestreich said.\n\nBut Sifert said the health care law actually limits choice.\n\n\u201cThe options have been taken away by the Obama administration,\u201d he said. \u201cAll those people that liked their plan and now they can\u2019t have it, that\u2019s been taken away from them.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "index.html", "image": "http://cronkitenews.asu.edu/assets/images/13/11/04-health-tovar-lead.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "WASHINGTON \u2013 Despite the troubled rollout of the Affordable Care Act, Arizona Democrats touted the law\u2019s \u201cmany, many positive aspects\u201d and showcased one woman Monday who successfully got health insurance through healthcare.gov.
