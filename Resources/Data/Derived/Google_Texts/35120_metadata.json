Over the course of a year that\u2019s $36,500 per employee up to $500,000 in total. The penalty on businesses for failing to comply with the employer mandate is only $2,000 per year.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to believe Congress or the President intended to punish employers more severely for actually helping their workers,\u201d said Kuhlman. \u201cNevertheless, that\u2019s the consequence and most small businesses don\u2019t know it.\u201d\n\nIn fact,\n\nAccording to the NFIB, 14 percent of small businesses that don\u2019t offer group insurance reimburse their workers instead.\n\n\u201cReimbursing employees for the cost of insurance or medical services is a way for small businesses to help their workers without the administrative headache of setting up a costly group plan,\u201d said Kuhlman. \u201cMost small employers don\u2019t have HR departments or benefits specialists, so this is a simpler, easier way to help their employees.\u201d\n\nCongress could remedy the situation by repealing the IRS rule. There is legislation in both houses awaiting action (S. 1697/H.R. 2911).", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=417961115?at=1000lkC&ct=sb-pjstar", "og": {"site_name": "Minding Business", "description": "An obscure IRS rule takes effect on Wednesday (July 1) under which small businesses that get caught helping their workers buy insurance or pay medical bills can be fined 18 times more than larger e\u2026", "title": "Will the IRS penalize small biz for helping workers buy health insurance?", "url": "http://blogs.pjstar.com/mindingbiz/2015/06/29/will-the-irs-penalize-small-biz-for-helping-workers-buy-health-insurance/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"account_id": 17800696, "card": "summary", "site": "@pjstar"}, "google-play-app": "app-id=com.spreedinc.providers.gatehousemedia.peoriajournalstar", "msvalidate.01": "7E15F9269E2CE66F2A488ABB04B5015E", "article": {"published_time": "2015-06-29T21:15:54+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-06-29T21:15:54+00:00"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.9", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcbf7d\"", "article_summary": "\u201cNevertheless, that\u2019s the consequence and most small businesses don\u2019t know it.\u201dIn fact,According to the NFIB, 14 percent of small businesses that don\u2019t offer group insurance reimburse their workers instead.\n\u201cMost small employers don\u2019t have HR departments or benefits specialists, so this is a simpler, easier way to help their employees.\u201dCongress could remedy the situation by repealing the IRS rule.\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to believe Congress or the President intended to punish employers more severely for actually helping their workers,\u201d said Kuhlman.\n\u201cReimbursing employees for the cost of insurance or medical services is a way for small businesses to help their workers without the administrative headache of setting up a costly group plan,\u201d said Kuhlman.\nThe penalty on businesses for failing to comply with the employer mandate is only $2,000 per year."}
