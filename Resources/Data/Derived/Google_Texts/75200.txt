The infamous NJ Transit restrooms at New York Penn Station, where duct tape held together a mirror and held up a toilet paper dispenser, will be closed for renovations for two weeks beginning Thursday.

While the rehabilitation work is being done on the bathrooms in the 7th Avenue Elevator Concourse at the station, customers can use the restrooms on the upper level west end of the station (by the 33rd Street/8th Avenue side adjacent to the Amtrak customer service office) and on the lower level east end in the Long Island Rail Road waiting area (7th Avenue side of the station), officials said.

The work will “provide customers with an improved facility at one of our busiest stations,” NJ Transit Executive Director Jim Weinstein said during a recent board meeting.

Over the summer, NJ Transit officials expressed embarrassment after Al Papp Jr., then president of the New Jersey Association of Railroad Passengers, twice brought up the wretched restrooms.

Photos taken by Papp and his family showed a toilet paper dispenser in the women’s bathroom that was held up by duct tape, which also was used to cover a crack in the men’s restroom. A soap dispenser was missing from the men’s room, and faucets failed to work.

After the second notification by Papp, temporary repairs were made to the bathrooms.
