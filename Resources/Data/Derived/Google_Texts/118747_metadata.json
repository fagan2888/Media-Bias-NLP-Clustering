Orange and Osceola had 90 heroin-related deaths in 2014 \u2014 twice as many as Miami-Dade County, which has a larger population. While the latest heroin epidemic is blamed on the shuttering of pill mills, prescription drugs continue to remain a public health issue here and in the U.S.\n\nWooden said that the health center hopes to start offering naltrexone in the next month or so.\n\nThe grant is part of a $94 million in Affordable Care Act funding that was distributed to 271 centers in 45 states, District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. Florida received more than $3 million.\n\nnmiller@tribune.com or 407-420-5158", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Grant to fight heroin, pain killer addiction helps Orlando center", "googlebot": "index", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Orlando Sentinel", "author": "Orlando Sentinel", "og": {"site_name": "OrlandoSentinel.com", "description": "Health Care Center for the Homeless is among nine health centers in Florida to receive funding from the federal government on Friday to fight the heroin and prescription drug abuse epidemic.", "title": "Grant to fight heroin, pain killer addiction helps Orlando center", "url": "http://www.orlandosentinel.com/health/os-substance-abuse-grant-center-for-homeless-20160311-story.html", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-56e34f15/turbine/os-substance-abuse-grant-center-for-homeless-20160311", "type": "article"}, "x-servername": "lalvp12.17", "twitter": {"site": "@orlandosentinel", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "AAC9C18F70AC386BC4DCF4DDF9BF1786", "robots": "index,follow", "keywords": "health care, heroin, abuse, fqhc, painkiller", "fb": {"admins": 100004353067097, "page_id": 5779052556, "app_id": 890804050949750}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=402223551, app-argument=http://www.orlandosentinel.com/deeplinkid/86190834", "googlebot-news": "index", "date": "2016-03-11", "Description": "Health Care Center for the Homeless is among nine health centers in Florida to receive funding from the federal government on Friday to fight the heroin and prescription drug abuse epidemic.", "y_key": "fb73650ad672fe45", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "health care, heroin, abuse, fqhc, painkiller"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3771\"", "article_summary": "Orange County officials created the heroin task force last August in response to the rising number of deaths from heroin.\n\"Unfortunately, we're seeing an increase in use of heroin and opioid addiction,\" said Bakari Burns, president and CEO of the health center.\n\"This is very timely and is a great boost to Florida's efforts to combat the heroin epidemic in our state,\" said Dr. Kevin Sherin, a member of Orange County Heroin Task Force and director of Orange County health department.\nHealth Care Center for the Homeless is among nine health centers in Florida to receive funding from the federal government on Friday to fight the heroin and prescription drug abuse epidemic.\nWooden said that the health center hopes to start offering naltrexone in the next month or so."}
