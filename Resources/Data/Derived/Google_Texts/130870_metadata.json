It will be brought to you by a creepy horde of left-wing activists embedded in the bureaucracy who will monitor everything you eat and drink to make sure that you don't have a Coke.\n\nThe federal government helped finance the creation of a so-called \u201cdiet choker\u201d that monitors the eating habits of the wearer. WearSens, created by engineers at the University of California Los Angeles (UCLA), is a necklace that can automatically detect when a person is eating or smoking, and can send alerts to a smart phone telling the user to stop. The invention received a $148,379 grant from the National Science Foundation (NSF) in 2013 to create a sensory necklace to \u201cfill the need of automatically detecting swallows and eating patterns.\u201d Researchers at UCLA, led by Majid Sarrafzadeh, the director of the Embedded and Reconfigurable Computing Lab of the university\u2019s computer science department, released the findings of a pilot study on the necklace this month. \u201cThese sensors track the vibration that occurs in the neck when a person chews food and swallows their drink,\u201d the report said. \u201cThis \u2018diet choker,\u2019 designed by engineers at University of California Los Angeles, can even sense what type of food you\u2019re eating since something crunchy is likely to make the neck vibrate more than food that\u2019s soft. The sensors can also determine if a person is downing a hot or cold drink.\u201d\n\nWhile this has obvious applications in North Korea and during Ramadan, it's also a great treat to stuff into ObamaCare enabling policies that fine users for not wearing diet chokers.\n\nWe are dealing with some very creepy people who are obsessed with outlawing food. That's not an exaggeration.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) is creating a $2 million research center to study how the government can \u201cnudge\u201d Americans toward making healthier eating habits. The agency is currently accepting grant applications to establish a \u201cCenter for Behavioral Economics and Healthy Food Choice Research,\u201d which will facilitate studies such as how breaking up combo meals at fast food restaurants would influence customers.\n\nThey've already rammed up food prices.\n\nBacon was at $3.60 a lb under Bush. It\u2019s now up to $5.60 a lb under Obama. The price of a whole frozen Thanksgiving turkey was at $1.32 a lb under Bush. It\u2019s up to $1.81 under Obama giving Americans that much less to be thankful for this Thanksgiving. The price of a tub of margarine went up from $1.50 to $2.10. But that won\u2019t be a problem for long because thanks to Obama it may soon become hard to get margarine at any price. Obama\u2019s FDA is considering a ban on trans fat in foods. Like incandescent bulbs and cheap free market health insurance, margarine may become one of those things that you can no longer buy anymore.\n\nSo now we can go full Brave New World. Maybe the Diet Choker can even be set to mete out electric shocks.", "article_metadata": {"rating": "general", "description": "The Revolution will not be brought to you by Coke.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"site_name": "Frontpage Mag", "description": "The Revolution will not be brought to you by Coke.", "title": "Obama Inc.
