Did the president know?\u201d Pirro said in her tongue-lashing monologue, according to her video posted on Youtube. \u201cAnd if he didn\u2019t know because he wasn\u2019t told or because he was hoodwinked \u2014 or worse, lied to \u2014 why aren\u2019t heads rolling? Why haven\u2019t people been fired? Why? Because that\u2019s not Obama\u2019s MO.\u201d\n\nAmericans are sick of government bureaucrats not taking accountability, or feeling any consequences for their failures, Pirro said. Some Democrats, amazingly enough, are even patting U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius on the back.\n\n\u201cI literally thought I was in the Land of Oz. Democrats were actually congratulating her for a job well done, thanking her for the millions of Americans who owe her more than anyone else a debt of gratitude for their health care,\u201d Pirro said. \u201cI didn\u2019t see any red heals clicking under the table that would magically turn on the website so that millions could actually get the health care that they were congratulating Sebelius about. But apparently, their yellow-brick road only holds six people.\u201d\n\nPirro\u2019s best sound bite came in pointing out perhaps Sebelius\u2019 most outlandish statement to date, when she blamed a wireless provider for the HealthCare.gov disaster. Pirro played a clip that showed Sebelius claiming: \u201cIt is the Verizon server that failed, not Healthcare.gov. And it affected not only HHS but other customers.\u201d\n\nWho would buy that garbage? Feeling for the many who are being dropped from their health plans of choice, Pirro said:\n\n\u201cWhy the lies? Mr. President, with all due respect, you lied to us. You sold us a bill of goods that puts many of us in a danger zone. Mr. President, you have promoted Obamacare for years. If it\u2019s so great, why aren\u2019t you on it? Why isn\u2019t Congress on it? Why aren\u2019t federal employees on it? Even simple Sebelius refused to go on the very program that you all think is so great for the rest of us. The website is not up and running. We can\u2019t keep our health plans, and we cannot keep our doctors. The truth is, you have lost all credibility. No one believes you anymore.\u201d\n\nPost navigation\n\n[poll id=\u201d135\u2033]", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.4.3", "og": {"site_name": "BizPac Review", "description": "Fox News favorite Judge Jeanine Pirro devoured President Obama in her weekly address Nov. 2, dining first on the ugly \u201cwho knew what and when\u201d debate on Obamacare.\u00a0 Pirro, like many others from both political parties, is fired up about the fact that no one has been fired over the fiasco. \u201cDid the president lie? \u2026", "title": "Judge Pirro: 'What happens in this administration, stays in this administration'", "locale": {"alternate": "en_US", "identifier": "en_US"}, "image": "http://www.bizpacreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/judge-11-2.png", "updated_time": "2013-11-04T10:01:03+00:00", "url": "http://www.bizpacreview.com/2013/11/03/judge-pirro-what-happens-in-this-administration-stays-in-this-administration-86490", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"widgets": {"csp": "on"}}, "alexaVerifyID": "qC73ojZoktel85cbl12SAFJar9k", "fb": {"admins": "10152426200106417,10152720237657852,10200650572686956,3854753687919,100215693385946,549853448412696", "pages": 169204449790211, "app_id": 1502886339979348}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/ConservativeNewsToday", "section": "News", "published_time": "2013-11-03T11:04:07+00:00", "modified_time": "2013-11-04T10:01:03+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc93d1\"", "article_summary": "Feeling for the many who are being dropped from their health plans of choice, Pirro said:\u201cWhy the lies?\nWe can\u2019t keep our health plans, and we cannot keep our doctors.\nDid the president know?\u201d Pirro said in her tongue-lashing monologue, according to her video posted on Youtube.\nMr. President, with all due respect, you lied to us.\nMr. President, you have promoted Obamacare for years."}
