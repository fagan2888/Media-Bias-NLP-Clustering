And shows from \u201cRoseanne\u201d to \u201cThe Cosby Show\u201d have focused on long-term, loving couples for whom the adventures of dating are significantly behind them.\n\nThat\u2019s because dating isn\u2019t, in and of itself, interesting, except to the people in the couple. The sort of complications that make the process of getting to know a potential romantic partner worth watching fit perfectly into the length of a movie comedy, but strike false notes when drawn out over the course of the series. If \u201cFriends\u201d had been just about Ross and Rachel breaking up and reuniting, it would be unwatchable. Three new romantic comedies starting this fall attempt to do the impossible \u2014 get us invested in a romance that\u2019s, inevitably, going to face an astonishing number of hurdles. Only one succeeds, and it\u2019s the one that doesn\u2019t indulge a twee high concept to try to gin up interest in its characters.\n\nABC\u2019s \u201cManhattan Love Story\u201d is the worst of the bunch, indulging a weird streak of nihilism easily mistaken for edge. The show, debuting Sept. 30, begins with its two lead characters\u2019 internal monologues, a concept that runs through the episode as we hear what each is thinking. (It\u2019s never too deep.) Peter (Jake McDorman) is ranking women\u2019s bodies, while Dana (Analeigh Tipton) is ranking their purses. Women love shopping! The couple end up meeting on a blind date in which he mocks her \u201cbucket list\u201d (yes) for her time in New York, specifically taking umbrage at her desire to go to the High Line, which makes no sense, because the High Line is great.\n\nDana is likable, though far too much of a naif to be believable as a woman hired from out-of-state to take on a job as an editor at a publishing house. In a scene emblematic of the show\u2019s understanding of technology, she frantically runs through different \u201crelationship statuses\u201d on Facebook \u2014 including \u201cwidowed\u201d \u2014 after a date. Meanwhile, Peter is utterly monstrous. (His vocalization of a completely tired rant about how kids today get too many trophies edges out Dana\u2019s internal wondering if crying makes a man gay.) The episode runs through so many reversals in its 22-minute length that one boggles at the thought of a full season \u2014 just how many times are we going to see a misunderstanding and then an apology? And given that both characters are paper-thin stereotypes \u2014 the naive innocent vs. the mean guy who doesn\u2019t care about love \u2014 what do their internal monologues add? The episode\u2019s conclusion asks us to keep tuning in to see whether Peter can move past his cynicism.
