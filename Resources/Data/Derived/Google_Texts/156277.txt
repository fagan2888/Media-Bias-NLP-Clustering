Seventy years ago in August, World War II ended, bringing to a close the worst period of brutality and inhumanity in world history. The war left more than 60 million dead worldwide. More than 400,000 Americans died in the conflict.

Sixteen million Americans — men and women — served in the struggle to wipe the stain of Nazism and Japanese aggression from the Earth.

They served at home and abroad, in Europe and the Pacific. They worked on land, on sea, in the air. They fought in Normandy, Anzio, at Midway, The Philippines.

They braved death on the Murmansk Run, under the sea and in a thousand other places.

Today, according to the Veterans Administration, barely 850,000 veterans of the struggle remain, most are well into their 90s. A further 492 die each day.

When they are gone, only posterity will be left to tell of their bravery in the face of heavy odds.

Until then, those who survive remain the most eloquent spokesmen for the generation that faced death on a daily basis to ensure a future of freedom and opportunity.
