She is being treated for lead poisoning after ingesting leadshot from a deceased animal. The beautiful bird was on display during the Bald Eagle Watch at the Jester Park Lodge. Attendees could also use spotting scopes set up around Saylorville Lake to observe bald eagles in the natural setting and learn about our national symbol, view a Red-Tailed Hawk up close, and watch two rehabilitated Barred Owls released back into the wild.

They leave home with shotguns and boxes of shells and hope to return with a deer, pheasant or dove. But those who use lead shot are contributing to the sickening and killing of other wildlife, including eagles.\n\nLead is poisonous. When the small toxic pellets contained in a shotgun shell scatter across fields and forests, they look like the weeds and seeds birds eat and the gravel and grit they consume to aid digestion. One or two pellets can kill a small bird. Bald eagles and other large raptors may die when they feed on animals that ingested or were shot with lead ammunition.\n\nIn the first three months of 2016, 14 bald eagles were brought to Saving Our Avian Resources, a raptor rehabilitation center in Manning. Ten of the eagles suffered from high levels of lead in their blood and the center is awaiting test results on two more. As of last week only one of the 14 was still alive. Over the past decade, half the eagles tested at the center had elevated levels of the toxic substance and several had lead shot or shrapnel in their digestive tracts.\n\nPeople who found the sick eagles describe the birds of prey as uncoordinated, unable to fly, acting blind and unaware of their surroundings \u2014 consistent with the impaired nervous system, breathing problems and vision problems caused by lead.\n\nBut preventing lead poisoning of wildlife is simple. Hunters should use nontoxic shot, including steel and copper, which is widely available. Many hunters already do.\n\nKay Neumann, the avian center\u2019s executive director, has hunted her entire life and has not used lead shot in more than a decade. \u201cIt is not respectful to wildlife. You respect the animals you\u2019re hunting and the animals in the wild,\u201d she said. Scores of studies conclude lead is an environmental hazard.\n\nBut in Iowa, it\u2019s up to hunters to do right by choosing nontoxic ammunition. State lawmakers and Gov. Terry Branstad have refused to require it. In fact, they\u2019ve gone out of their way to ensure hunters can spread poison on land.\n\nIn 2011, the state\u2019s Natural Resource Commission, a bipartisan board of individuals appointed by the governor, voted unanimously to ban lead shot for hunters who insist on killing small songbirds for a forkful of meat. The chairman of the commission at the time, Greg Drees, told a Register editorial writer at the time that he paid four cents more per shell for non-toxic steel shot and had not used lead ammunition to hunt anything in years.\n\n\u201cWe got rid of [lead] from gasoline. We got rid of it from our paint,\u201d he said. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service banned lead shot in hunting waterfowl 20 years ago. \u201cThe lead toxicity in the water environment is well-documented. How can people think the toxicity isn\u2019t present in the uplands as well? There is solid science,\u201d Drees said.\n\nBut lawmakers blocked the commission\u2019s proposal after listening to complaints from hunters, including Marcus Branstad, the governor\u2019s son. The next year, Branstad signed an executive order rescinding the commission\u2019s ban on lead shot. The year after that, he appointed his son to the commission.\n\nIowa leaders have repeatedly shown they have no respect for Mother Nature. From lawmakers who refuse to fund a conservation trust created by voters to a governor who takes executive action to ensure mourning dove hunters can use lead shot, state officials should be ashamed.\n\nIt is up to hunters to do the right thing. If they continue to use lead ammunition, eagles and other wildlife will continue to pay the price.\n\nState of Iowa silent on poisoning wildlife\n\nThe United States banned lead shot for hunting waterfowl in 1991 due to lead poisoning of birds. At least 26 states have restrictions beyond the federal mandate, according to Minnesota\u2019s Department of Natural Resources. Iowa is not among them. The only advice the Iowa Department of Natural Resources offers relates to humans minimizing exposure to toxic shot when they eat venison.\n\nOther states are more enlightened about the impact lead is having on wildlife:\n\nWisconsin cautions hunters about the dangers of lead ammunition. Its website includes a report concluding that 25 percent of trumpeter swan fatalities and 15 percent of bald eagle fatalities are attributed to lead toxicity. About 30 percent of dead loons tested were poisoned with lead. \u201cLead poisoning continues to be a significant mortality factor for several species of birds in Wisconsin,\u201d according to the report.\n\nMinnesota's Department of Natural Resources is considering requiring hunters to use non-toxic shot for small game on some wildlife management areas. Why? \u201cBecause of its toxicity\u2026. State wildlife areas contain abundant wetlands and lead shot continues to be deposited in those wetlands as a result of upland game bird hunting,\u201d according to a state report.\n\nIn Washington, it is against the law to possess anything other than nontoxic shot when hunting upland game birds, including pheasant and mourning doves. Violators can be fined $1,000 and lose small-game hunting privileges for two years.\n\nCalifornia restricted the use of lead ammunition in 2008 because eagles, condors, swans and loons were being poisoned. California will become the first state to prohibit the use of all lead ammunition in all hunting when a ban is fully implemented July 2019.\n\nGiving up lead is not difficult\n\nSome hunters continue to use lead shot due to concerns nontoxic alternatives are more expensive, less accurate or damage shotgun barrels. The Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife addresses these concerns:\n\nCost: Though some nontoxic alternatives are more expensive than lead shot, steel shot prices have declined and are approaching the cost of lead. As more consumers demand nontoxic ammunition, prices are expected to further decline.\n\nPerformance: In numerous shooting tests, \u201cwounding loss\u201d from steel shot has been no different than from lead shot. Several of the new alternatives have ballistics properties similar to lead, helping to reduce concerns about effectiveness.\n\nBarrel damage: Fears about damage from nontoxic shot have not been substantiated for the vast majority of shotguns.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://dmreg.co/1MKFSNO", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Though this state allows spreading poisonous pellets on land, hunters should choose nontoxic shot", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600025120", "og": {"site_name": "Des Moines Register", "description": "Though this state allows spreading poisonous pellets on land, hunters should choose nontoxic shot", "title": "Editorial: Hunting with lead shot kills Iowa eagles", "url": "http://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/opinion/editorials/2016/04/02/editorial-hunting-lead-shot-kills-iowa-eagles/82399762/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/desmoinesregister.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Though this state allows spreading poisonous pellets on land, hunters should choose nontoxic shot", "creator": "@DMRegister", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/38269bed551e91df2fef2e83ad3b5f7e0dad8e6a/c=355-0-2045-1690&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/IowaCity/IowaCity/2014/03/16//1395014795060-D5-20130127-NEWS01-301250802-61.jpg", "title": "Editorial: Hunting with lead shot kills Iowa eagles", "site": "@DMRegister", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "p": {"domain_verify": "372c291dc2b106308d26264f4fba3b10"}, "fb": {"app_id": 169766623060429}, "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Geography/Washington", "gci-asset-type": "story", "gci-categories": "Geography/Washington", "title": "Editorial: Hunting with lead shot kills Iowa eagles", "author": "The Register's editorial", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "opinion/editorials", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/cd742cc2454518c78e37f555112af3c9fee8f811/c=710-0-1978-1690/local/-/media/IowaCity/IowaCity/2014/03/16//1395014795060-D5-20130127-NEWS01-301250802-61.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/22eb2a73dde9c54be4cad4516db8c26ae811864e/c=355-0-2045-1690/local/-/media/IowaCity/IowaCity/2014/03/16//1395014795060-D5-20130127-NEWS01-301250802-61.jpg", "contenttype": "story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/c79053e1b30b03337d3a970ee4655e9a58b1844c/c=77-0-2323-1690/local/-/media/IowaCity/IowaCity/2014/03/16//1395014795060-D5-20130127-NEWS01-301250802-61.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/49fda961bfcbd4af795fdf0a8110f0a9803aaabb/c=0-0-2400-1354&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/IowaCity/IowaCity/2014/03/16//1395014795060-D5-20130127-NEWS01-301250802-61.jpg", "publishtime": "2016-04-02T20:57:00.467000-05:00", "shorthed": "Editorial: Lead shot kills eagles", "articleid": 82399762, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/881364fc6cab5e12e46037cc837b3034a6fedc10/c=0-0-2400-1354/local/-/media/IowaCity/IowaCity/2014/03/16//1395014795060-D5-20130127-NEWS01-301250802-61.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/63c8ee0e40ac6374393dec91b7f962b3626c5f7a/c=960-0-1906-1690/local/-/media/IowaCity/IowaCity/2014/03/16//1395014795060-D5-20130127-NEWS01-301250802-61.jpg"}}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070"}, "article_summary": "Performance: In numerous shooting tests, \u201cwounding loss\u201d from steel shot has been no different than from lead shot.\nState of Iowa silent on poisoning wildlifeThe United States banned lead shot for hunting waterfowl in 1991 due to lead poisoning of birds.\nBald eagles and other large raptors may die when they feed on animals that ingested or were shot with lead ammunition.\nBut those who use lead shot are contributing to the sickening and killing of other wildlife, including eagles.\nKay Neumann, the avian center\u2019s executive director, has hunted her entire life and has not used lead shot in more than a decade."}
