UPDATE: After much discussion and a 6-5 vote, the Kansas State fair Board approved Kansas State Fair implementing some type of smoking restrictions at the fair grounds starting in 2016.

General Manager Denny Stoecklein says the board had a very long discussion about the pros and cons of such restrictions. Eventually it was narrowly approved that in two years there will be smoking in designated areas only.

Where and how that plan will be put in place will come before the board in the future.

The board also approved the development of a master plan for renovations to the fair grounds. Several of the fair buildings are in need of either replacing or repair.

No timeline was given for when the Master plans would be in place.

The Kansas State Fair is being asked to consider banning smoking throughout the fair grounds.

A Reno County youth group called Communities That Care has twice discussed its research and ideas on a smoking ban with the state fair board, which will consider the request Tuesday.

The Hutchinson News reports smoking is currently not allowed in the fair buildings or in the grandstand seating area. The youth group wants the fair board to expand that ban to the entire grounds, saying it would create a healthier environment for fairgoers.

Fair manager Denny Stoecklein says the board has to consider that about 20 percent - or 78,000 fairgoers each year - are smokers. He says other issues are accommodating vendors who smoke and how to enforce the ban.
