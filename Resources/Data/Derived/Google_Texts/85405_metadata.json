It would implement those changes unless Congress overruled it through legislation that achieved similar aims, or if 60 senators voted to override its cost-cutting provisions.\n\nCritics have lambasted the IPAB as \u201c15 unelected bureaucrats\u201d who ostensibly could rein in seniors\u2019 care, although no one\u2019s been appointed to the board yet.\n\n\u201cThis unelected panel exists only to take control away from patients and rations care \u2014 and it\u2019s seniors who will suffer the consequences,\u201d said Ways and Means Committee Chairman Paul Ryan, Wisconsin Republican.\n\nSome Democrats agreed but didn\u2019t like how the Republicans paid for repeal \u2014 $7 billion from Obamacare\u2019s prevention and public health fund \u2014 while others said the bill was just another part of the GOP\u2019s overall scheme to take down the health care law, and that they should give IPAB a chance.\n\nThe board was designed to serve as a cost-cutting back-stop, \u201conly to come into effect if other efforts weren\u2019t successful,\u201d Rep. Sander Levin, Michigan Democrat, said in floor debate.\n\nLooking ahead, GOP leaders would have to gather 60 votes on the Senate side overcome a possible Democratic filibuster, and two-thirds majorities in both chambers to override Mr. Obama\u2019s veto.\n\nThe White House said the House was jumping the gun and erasing a key cost-cutting tool that is prohibited from recommending changes that would ration care or drive up premiums.\n\n\u201cThe bill would eliminate an important safeguard that, under current law, will help reduce the rate of Medicare cost growth responsibly while protecting Medicare beneficiaries and the traditional program,\u201d the administration said. \u201cWhile this safeguard is not projected to be needed now or for a number of years given recent exceptionally slow growth in health care costs, it could serve a valuable role should rapid growth in health costs return.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The House voted Tuesday to repeal another piece of Obamacare, this time a Medicare cost-cutting board that opponents have decried as a \"death panel\" that could ration care.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "The House voted Tuesday to repeal another piece of Obamacare, this time a Medicare cost-cutting board that opponents have decried as a \u201cdeath panel\u201d that could ration care.", "title": "\u2018Death panel\u2019 repealed in House Obamacare vote", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jun/23/death-panel-repealed-house-obamacare-vote/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/06/11/e2d253f6ecc00119790f6a7067002d98.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/06/11/e2d253f6ecc00119790f6a7067002d98.jpg", "description": "The House voted Tuesday to repeal another piece of Obamacare, this time a Medicare cost-cutting board that opponents have decried as a \"death panel\" that could ration care.", "card": "summary", "title": "\u2018Death panel\u2019 repealed in House Obamacare vote"}, "Author": "Tom Howell Jr.", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Politics, Health Medical Pharma, Medicare, Independent Payment Advisory Board"}, "article_summary": "The House voted Tuesday to repeal another piece of Obamacare, this time a Medicare cost-cutting board that opponents have decried as a \u201cdeath panel\u201d that could ration care.\nMajority Republicans led the charge to repeal the Independent Payment Advisory Board (IPAB), 244 votes to 154, and were joined by 11 Democrats who ignored President Obama\u2019s veto threat.\nThe Affordable Care Act of 2010 created the board to recommend savings within Medicare if the program exceeded a target growth rate.\nThe White House said the House was jumping the gun and erasing a key cost-cutting tool that is prohibited from recommending changes that would ration care or drive up premiums.\n\u201cWhile this safeguard is not projected to be needed now or for a number of years given recent exceptionally slow growth in health care costs, it could serve a valuable role should rapid growth in health costs return.\u201d"}
