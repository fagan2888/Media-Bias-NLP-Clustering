The Department of Social Services reports that last year 10,807 families received benefits through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, which amounts to 32,749 individuals.\n\nExperts say between better access to the benefits and a high unemployment rate, many factors have contributed to these numbers. Ten years ago, there were only 1,900 families receiving governmental food assistance. Between 2013 and 2014 alone, there was a 4,000 family jump.\n\nCare and Share Food Bank has noticed the increase as well. President and CEO Lynne Telford decided six months ago to lead the effort to eliminate the need for food assistance in Pueblo. \"There is enough food in America,\" she says. \"We live in America, where there's enough food for everybody who needs it, so we started breaking that problem down.\"\n\nTelford says most alarming is that one in four children in Pueblo does not have enough food to eat. \"If kids don't have good nutrition while they're learning,\" she says, \"their ability to absorb that and be socially responsible is all impaired if they can only think about where their next meal is coming from.\"\n\nShe and Social Services administrators agree that the root problem is unemployment. Telford says, \"We're not seeing that the economic recovery that we hear about on the news all the time is getting to the people who need food yet. We hope it will. We hope that we'll start to see a change in it, but we haven't yet.\"\n\nWhile Social Services has not tracked statistics on the flock of people coming to the area looking for work in the marijuana industry, other agencies like the United Way and Posada have pointed to that as another factor in the high unemployment rate.\n\nFood stamps are now also easier to access, with online services and agencies that help with applications. Additionally, the Affordable Care Act has allowed more people to be identified as eligible through Medicaid. Family Services Center administrator Karen Garcia explains that social service workers can now offer more programs like SNAP to those who did not know they were eligible.\n\nCare and Share's five-year plan is to raise $2.6 million on top of the food bank's normal funds to eliminate hunger in Pueblo. The first year goal was $350,000, and Telford says six months in, they are almost there. \"We have 300 partner agencies across Southern Colorado giving food out to people,\" she says, \"and we're working with them and we can really do this. We can make sure that everyone who is food insecure has access to good, nutritious food.\"\n\nSocial Services is also working to lower the unemployment rate through state program Employment First.
