Neil Magny is a well-traveled man.

Since 2014, the Denver-based UFC fighter has fought 10 times with his 11th coming up this weekend. He has logged more than 40,000 miles across the globe to get to his fights during that span — 80,000-plus if you include the journey back. He’s done battle everywhere from the Philippines to Mexico to Brazil. And he’s the only UFC fighter to have fought five times in back-to-back calendar years.

It’s a unique experience, said Magny (17-4), part of a journey that has allowed him to see places he probably would not have seen.

On Saturday, the jetsetting welterweight will take on No. 13 Hector Lombard (35-4-1) of Cuba at UFC Fight Night roughly 8,000 miles away from Denver in Brisbane, Australia. A win would continue the 28-year-old’s momentum as he’s won nine of his previous 10 fights. Magny, ranked No. 9 among UFC’s welterweights, has won his last two via split decision over Kelvin Gastelum (No. 12) and Erick Silva. Read more…
