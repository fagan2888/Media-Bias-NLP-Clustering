Lytle is surprised by how many northern Indiana residents have never heard of \u201cthe great circus train wreck of 1918\u201d in northwest Indiana.\n\nLytle, a former resident of Niles and Plymouth who now lives in Hammond, where the headline-making rail tragedy happened nearly a century ago, decided true details of the account deserved a book treatment. \u201cThe Great Circus Train Wreck of 1918: Tragedy on the Indiana Lakeshore\u201d (2013 History Press $19.99), is his 109-page archive-photo filled paperback to chronicle the freak accident of the local railways.\n\n\u201cMine is not the first book to be written on this subject,\u201d Lytle said.\n\n\u201cA previous book titled \u2018No Performance Today\u2019 was published in 1972 by Warren A. Reeder Jr., past president of the Hammond Historical Society and trustee for the Hammond Public Library. It was Warren who had begged his father to take him to the circus on that fateful day of June 22, 1918.\u201d\n\nLytle is the local history librarian at Hammond Public Library and an officer of the Hammond Historical Society. When he began his position at the library nearly a decade ago, he was fascinated with the library archive\u2019s collection of unpublished train wreck photos. The idea to publish a new book on the subject was born. The first edition was published in 2010.\n\n\u201cWhile working at the library, I found that because there are still so many railroad families who live in Hammond, for patrons of a certain age, they know about the circus train wreck,\u201d Lytle said.\n\n\u201cBut for so many more people from a younger generation or those who live outside of Hammond, this has been a long forgotten news headline.\u201d\n\nLytle was born in Peru, Ind., the famed area of the Hoosier state noted as \u201cthe old circus winter quarters\u201d and now home to The International Circus Hall of Fame. His fascination with circus life started early and continued after he moved with his parents to Niles, where he graduated from Brandywine High School in 1965. After time in the military, he earned his library science degree from Indiana University in Bloomington and then lived in Plymouth.\n\nWhen new interested minds hear about Lytle\u2019s book and the true incident, many of the questions are common repeats.\n\n\u201cFirst of all, there were no animals, exotic or otherwise, involved in the wreck,\u201d he reminds.\n\n\u201cThis traveling circus has two train segments and the train pulling the cars with the animals was dispatched prior to the secondary train which carried all of the performers and workers. The reason for this was the weight of pulling all of the cars with both animals and performers would have been too much for one train engine. Also, the animals were better off sent ahead on the first train so they could be unloaded and fed in a timely manner.\u201d\n\nAs so neatly explained by Lytle, in the cool, predawn hours on that June night in 1918, a train engineer closed his cab window as he chugged toward Hammond. He drifted to sleep, and his train bore down on the idle Hagenbeck-Wallace Circus Train. Soon after, the sleeping engineer\u2019s locomotive plowed into the circus train.\n\nIn the subsequent wreckage and blaze, more than 200 circus performers were injured and 86 were killed, most of whom were interred in a mass grave in the Showmen\u2019s Rest Section of Chicago\u2019s Woodlawn Cemetery.\n\n\u201cWhile doing my research for this new circus wreck book, I had access to new records from area hospitals, which had not been previously available detailing those who were injured,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cOne new detail I discovered was that some of the victims in the tragedy were originally thought to be some of the black men who were porters on the train. However, as it turned out, these were white men whose bodies were burned so badly, at that time, doctors were not able to even distinguish the true skin tone.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "South Bend Tribune", "description": "Indiana circus train wreck of 1918 recalled in new book", "title": "A story about chills without thrills", "url": "http://www.southbendtribune.com/news/local/a-story-about-chills-without-thrills/article_65313867-9ecc-58dc-a9b1-f3b68cc00398.html", "image": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/southbendtribune.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/8/42/84275fd0-c830-5678-a3d6-89b7b629f37a/54a8e2ae9067b.image.jpg?resize=657%2C600", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/southbendtribune.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/8/42/84275fd0-c830-5678-a3d6-89b7b629f37a/54a8e2ae9067b.image.jpg?resize=657%2C600", "description": "Indiana circus train wreck of 1918 recalled in new book", "site": "@sbtribune", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "A story about chills without thrills"}, "description": "Indiana circus train wreck of 1918 recalled in new book", "Published Date": "2015-01-04T06:00:00", "fb": {"app_id": 368553839952510}, "keywords": "#loc,hammond,hagenbeck-wallace circus,train wrecks,local", "google-site-verification": "3g1dW83HuQbWT4MB-AtH0czzqvwh0eF8rwGwC6sjOhM", "news_keywords": "#loc,hammond,hagenbeck-wallace circus,train wrecks,local"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1757\"", "article_summary": "He drifted to sleep, and his train bore down on the idle Hagenbeck-Wallace Circus Train.\nAuthor Richard M.
