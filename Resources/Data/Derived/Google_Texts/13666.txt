ADM Closes $191M Specialty Food Deal

The target, Special Commodities, sells natural and organic nuts, fruits and seeds

Archer Daniels Midland Co. has purchased Specialty Commodities Inc. for $191 million.

Special Commodities, headquartered in Fargo, North Dakota, originates, processes and distributes specialty ingredients, including natural and organic nuts, fruits, seeds, legumes and grains.

Decatur, Illinois-based ADM processes and provides food ingredients for customers in more than 140 countries.

The company will be added to ADM's Wild Flavors and specialty ingredients business unit. In July, the company agreed to buy Wild Flavors, a maker of natural food ingredients, for about $3 billion.

The deal marks an exit for Goldner Hawn Johnson & Morrison Inc., which is a Minneapolis private equity firm founded in 1989. The group invested in Specialty Commodities in October 2008.

Deloitte Corporate Finance LLC was Specialty Commodities' financial adviser for the deal.

Companies have been looking to buy businesses that tie in to consumer interest in better-for-you food. Recent acquisitions include Advent International's deal for Noosa Yoghurt LLC, and Snow Phipps Group LLC's purchase of Teasdale Foods Inc.
