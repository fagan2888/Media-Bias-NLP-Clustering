REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst (UNITED STATES - Tags: POLITICS TPX IMAGES OF THE DAY) - RTR3CGC3\n\n4228085\n\nYoung adults still think health insurance is too expensive \u2014 especially after Obamacare hiked health care costs for most, according to a survey from top private health exchange eHealth.\n\nThe private, online health exchange has won more young adults over to its business than the federally- and state-run Obamacare exchanges.\n\nBut while eHealth has gotten a large chunk of those between the ages of 18 and 25 to sign up for coverage, young adults still overwhelming believe they can\u2019t afford health coverage, and Obamacare is making things worse. Sixty-three percent of respondents said the health care law upped their premiums; 48 percent said it increased their annual deductible.\n\nAmong those who purchased eHealth plans, 62 percent believe their monthly insurance premiums are more expensive than they can comfortably afford. That\u2019s with Obamacare subsidies, however \u2014 eHealth was one of few private carriers to win an exception from the Obama administration to offer the federal taxpayer premium credits on its coverage. Only a small subset of the company\u2019s customers are eligible for the subsidies \u2014 but with those on and off the exchange calling health care costs too high, support for the health care law among young adults could slip.\n\nYoung adults are even less enthusiastic about the cost of deductibles on their health coverage. Seventy-three percent told eHealth that their annual deductibles are too costly for them to comfortably afford. While premium costs have been the primary hurdle for Obamacare enrollment efforts, many customers are facing skyrocketing out of pocket costs that could prevent them from actually using their new insurance.\n\nSixty-nine percent said they\u2019d only be comfortable with a monthly premium of $100 or less, while 56 percent would be comfortable with an annual deductible of $1,000 or less \u2014 significantly less than bronze-rated plans, which usually offer a deductible around $6,000. Almost two thirds, 64 percent, said they do not have enough money saved to pay their current deductible if they had to, such as in the event of a sudden, costly illness or injury. The discrepancy could force young adults in particular to go without health care even though they\u2019re counted as insured.\n\nThe company\u2019s customers that signed up during Obamacare\u2019s open enrollment period are paying an average premium of $146 per month with an annual deductible of $4,955, eHealth reported.\n\nObamacare appears to have disproportionately affected young adults. Sixty-three percent said they were forced to change insurance plans due to the health care law, and another 30 percent had to change their doctors, according to eHealth.\n\nIt\u2019s not that young adults dislike their health insurance plans \u2014 59 percent said they were happy with their coverage, while 41 percent weren\u2019t. But the prices are prohibitive for some.\n\nYoung adults are a key demographic to keep health insurance rates low on and off Obamacare exchanges, as insurers are looking for young and healthy customers that don\u2019t cost much to insure. But it\u2019s possible that customers will begin to drop out if its not financially viable to continue paying health insurance premiums month after month \u2014 especially if drastically high out-of-pocket costs prevent young adults from being able to actually seek health care.\n\nFollow Sarah on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Sarah Hurtubise", "description": "Young adults still think health insurance is too expensive -- especially after Obamacare hiked health care costs for most, according to a survey from top", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "Young adults still think health insurance is too expensive -- especially after Obamacare hiked health care costs for most, according to a survey from top private health exchange eHealth.
