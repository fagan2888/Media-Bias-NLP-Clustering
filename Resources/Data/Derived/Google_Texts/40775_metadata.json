(Photo: The Register)Buy Photo\n\nIowa has joined with Hilton Worldwide to offer millions of Hilton points to U.S. military members for free stays at the chain's hotels while job hunting.\n\nHilton is offering the rewards through its HHonors Points program. Military members who receive the points can use them for stays at hotels within the continental United States, Alaska and Hawaii.\n\nThe points are intended for military members and their families to use while looking for jobs, attending interviews, receiving skills training or hunting for houses for newly employed Iowans.\n\nIowa Workforce Development announced the partnership in a statement today.\n\nService members are each eligible for up to 100,000 points per 12-month period. That equals about three free nights.\n\nSince rates and point values vary by Hilton hotel, however, the number of free nights will as well.\n\nTo receive the points military members and their families need to sign up for an HHonors account, then contact Iowa Workforce Development. Once verified, the state agency will tell Hilton to apply the points to the correct account.\n\nPoints can be acquired by contacting Iowa Workforce Development at the agency's 19 IowaWORKS Centers or by calling 855-9HB-IOWA (855-942-4692).\n\nIn a statement, Iowa Workforce Development Director Teresa Wahlert said the program fits with the state's Home Base Iowa initiative, which Gov. Terry Branstad announced in November. The Home Base initiative is intended to match military members and veterans with jobs in Iowa and bring them to the state.\n\nIowa is the first state to join the program, according to the statement. Three others -- Texas, Arizona and Minnesota -- are still going through the process.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://dmreg.co/1izDGJO", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Iowa has joined with hotel chain Hilton Worldwide to offer million of Hilton points to U.S. military members for free stays at Hilton hotels while", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600025120", "og": {"site_name": "Des Moines Register", "description": "Iowa has joined with hotel chain Hilton Worldwide to offer million of Hilton points to U.S. military members for free stays at Hilton hotels while", "title": "Iowa military members can get free Hilton hotel nights", "url": "http://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/money/business/2014/06/23/iowa-workforce-development-hilton-hhonors-military/11259887/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/desmoinesregister.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Iowa has joined with hotel chain Hilton Worldwide to offer million of Hilton points to U.S. military members for free stays at Hilton hotels while", "creator": "@DMRegister", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/af99776abd39f38eacdd8b62a01fe0f52204b6af/c=245-0-1083-838&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/DesMoines/GenericImages/2013/12/12//1386867248000-ia-money.jpg", "title": "Iowa military members can get free Hilton hotel nights", "site": "@DMRegister", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "p": {"domain_verify": "372c291dc2b106308d26264f4fba3b10"}, "fb": {"app_id": 169766623060429}, "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Organizations/U.S. Armed Forces", "gci-asset-type": "story", "gci-categories": "Organizations/U.S. Armed Forces", "title": "Iowa military members can get free Hilton hotel nights", "author": "Matthew Patane", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "money/business", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/8318199850a83af187a37fdaf9c1fc74654917ed/c=135-0-763-838/local/-/media/DesMoines/GenericImages/2013/12/12//1386867248000-ia-money.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/0a7b17c1bc362f76a5f3a45b71429c921bbb1c4b/c=245-0-1083-838/local/-/media/DesMoines/GenericImages/2013/12/12//1386867248000-ia-money.jpg", "contenttype": "story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/5db8b00681e6acc08ddc4f32b3d2ea0a93c0a981/c=192-0-1305-837/local/-/media/DesMoines/GenericImages/2013/12/12//1386867248000-ia-money.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/c34801576a8c7735aec7615ae8f725e41f59b943/c=0-12-1440-824&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/DesMoines/GenericImages/2013/12/12//1386867248000-ia-money.jpg", "publishtime": "2014-06-23T16:29:00.660000-05:00", "shorthed": "Iowa joins Hilton's military veterans initiative", "articleid": 11259887, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/f0bb44716986ca7b59c2614e466d459e09eae117/c=0-12-1440-824/local/-/media/DesMoines/GenericImages/2013/12/12//1386867248000-ia-money.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/46521edc588ea97aa01eb73f322065cc2f8fc68c/c=153-0-619-835/local/-/media/DesMoines/GenericImages/2013/12/12//1386867248000-ia-money.jpg"}}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf001\"", "article_summary": "(Photo: The Register)Buy PhotoIowa has joined with Hilton Worldwide to offer millions of Hilton points to U.S. military members for free stays at the chain's hotels while job hunting.\nTo receive the points military members and their families need to sign up for an HHonors account, then contact Iowa Workforce Development.\nIn a statement, Iowa Workforce Development Director Teresa Wahlert said the program fits with the state's Home Base Iowa initiative, which Gov.\nThe Home Base initiative is intended to match military members and veterans with jobs in Iowa and bring them to the state.\nMilitary members who receive the points can use them for stays at hotels within the continental United States, Alaska and Hawaii."}
