People who reported a lack of meaning in their lives faced a 23 percent greater risk for all causes of death and a 19 percent greater risk for those related to conditions of the heart.\n\nIt isn\u2019t necessarily the case that finding meaning in life inherently makes you less likely to die \u2014 people who see the big picture still fall victim to disease and bad luck like the rest of us. But researchers believe there\u2019s great value in the social support and optimism that comes with a richer set of guiding principles. With more resources at our disposal, both tangibly and spiritually, we arm ourselves to fight death with greater force.\n\nDr. Randy Cohen, lead author of the new study and preventive cardiologist at Mount Sinai St. Luke's and Mount Sinai Roosevelt, says building a fulfilling life in pursuit of something greater brings with it a host of practical benefits. \u201cAs part of our overall health,\u201d he said in a press release, \u201ceach of us needs to ask ourselves the critical question of \u2018do I have a sense of purpose in my life?\u2019 If not, you need to work toward the important goal of obtaining one for your overall well-being.\u201d\n\nCohen and a team of researchers analyzed data on more than 137,000 people from 10 relevant studies. They tracked people\u2019s rate of death according to their sense of purpose in life, ultimately finding it was the people who felt fulfilled that suffered fewer strokes and heart attacks and needed fewer coronary artery bypass surgeries and procedures to install cardiac stents. Alan Rozanski, study co-author and Director of Wellness and Prevention Programs for Mount Sinai Heart, says the findings build on prior work into the boosting effects social support can have on depression and anxiety.\n\nA sense of direction doesn\u2019t just help us in the short term, even though that is critical to deciding what to eat for breakfast and which shirt to wear. It also sets us on a course for years, sometimes an entire lifetime. When we dedicate ourselves to something, we engage in the practice with all aspects of our attention and energy. Life feels less frightening when we know where we\u2019re headed, hopefully to the extent we can enjoy the experiences as they come. By the time we\u2019ve hit old age, the meaning becomes clear: Multiple studies have found senior citizens are less likely to face Alzheimer\u2019s and late-age ill health when they maintain a sense of purpose.\n\nUpcoming research should examine ways to help people without this sense of direction stay healthy, the researchers conclude. Their data will be presented at the upcoming American Heart Association EPI/Lifestyle 2015 Scientific Sessions in Baltimore.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "preserve, heart, health, having, purpose, life", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Finding direction comes with a wealth of support systems, which ultimately work to keep you alive longer.", "title": "Having A Purpose In Life May Save Your Heart", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/preserve-heart-health-having-purpose-life-324758", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/03/06/directions.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Finding direction comes with a wealth of support systems, which ultimately work to keep you alive longer.", "title": "Having A Purpose In Life May Save Your Heart", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/preserve-heart-health-having-purpose-life-324758", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/03/06/directions.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/03/06/directions.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Vitality", "published_time": "2015-03-06T16:01:11-05:00", "modified_time": "2015-03-06T16:01:10-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Finding direction comes with a wealth of support systems, which ultimately work to keep you alive longer."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcdcd4\"", "article_summary": "Wandering through life without direction or goals could be detrimental to your health, a new large-scale study finds.\nAlan Rozanski, study co-author and Director of Wellness and Prevention Programs for Mount Sinai Heart, says the findings build on prior work into the boosting effects social support can have on depression and anxiety.\nTheir data will be presented at the upcoming American Heart Association EPI/Lifestyle 2015 Scientific Sessions in Baltimore.\nLife feels less frightening when we know where we\u2019re headed, hopefully to the extent we can enjoy the experiences as they come.\nUpcoming research should examine ways to help people without this sense of direction stay healthy, the researchers conclude."}
