The Intermountain Rural Electric Association warns about a scam targeted toward their customers, officials said on Saturday.

Automated calls claiming to be from IREA are being made to customers saying if the customer does not pay their bill, their power will be disconnected shortly, according to an IREA news release.

The call refers customers to call a number with an (888) prefix, the release said.

IREA warns customers not to make any payment arrangements with this number.

The association said that they will never ask customers to use a pre-paid card for payment.

“IREA customers are encouraged to always call IREA directly at 303-688-3100 to make any electric bill payments.

The Intermountain Rural Electric Association serves more than 140,000 customers with 5,000 square miles in central Colorado, according to the company’s website.
