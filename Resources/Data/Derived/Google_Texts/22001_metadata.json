But a high school science teacher at Colo-Nesco school in Iowa, Joe Cisna, chose to make an amateur documentary this year that discovered surprising results when he ate McDonald\u2019s every day for 90 days: He lost 37 lbs.\n\nIt was all about choice, Cisna told KCCI News. \u201cI can eat any food at McDonald\u2019s that I want, as long as I\u2019m smart with the rest of the day of what I balance it out with,\u201d Cisna said in a video interview. He gave himself strict guidelines \u2014 he could only eat 2,000 calories per day, which is the reference number used on nutrition facts panels and which the FDA uses to figure out daily nutritional values.\n\nCisna tried to make sure he ate his required nutrients, such as protein, and he also walked 45 minutes per day as a major lifestyle change. A typical McDonald\u2019s breakfast for Cisna consisted of egg white delights and oatmeal with one percent milk; for lunch he ate a salad, and dinner was a traditional value meal, which typically consisted of a burger or sandwich with fries.\n\nBut that didn\u2019t mean he refrained from splurging on the less healthy aspects of the McDonald\u2019s menu. \u201cI had the Big Macs, the quarter pounders with cheese,\u201d Cisna told KCCI News. \u201cI had sundaes, I had ice cream cones.\u201d But it was the portion sizes, the time that he ate them, and the amount of calories that made all the difference.\n\nScience teacher John Cisna ate only McDonald's for 90 days \u2014 and lost 37 pounds. KCCI News/YouTube\n\nHis 45-minute walks assisted in the weight loss, as he had never exercised or dieted before. Along with losing almost 40 lbs., Cisna's cholesterol levels even dropped from 249 to 170. \u201cI tell people not only can I see my shoes now, but I can also tie them,\u201d he told KCCI News. \u201cIt\u2019s our choices that make us fat, not McDonald\u2019s.\u201d\n\nOf course, in recent times McDonald\u2019s has become more aware of its menu\u2019s offerings, featuring salads, fruit, and egg white meals that previously were unavailable. If Cisna had completed this experiment a decade ago, he may have had different results. Back in 2004, Spurlock ate everything on the menu once and \"super sized\" his order if he was asked \u2014 ultimately eating up to 5,000 calories a day. His point was that McDonald\u2019s actually was inspiring poor eating choices by offering high-calorie meals and lacking healthier sides than fries. Cisna turned the blame on humans instead, saying it was our own choices, rather than the choices of fast food companies, that has the largest effect on our health. Monitoring your caloric intake isn\u2019t complicated at McDonald\u2019s, as the company provides nutrition facts for all of its items, from Big Macs to side salads.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "mcdonald's, joe cisna, calorie intake, fast food diet", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Joe Cisna, a science teacher from Iowa, lost weight after eating McDonald\u2019s for 90 days.", "title": "Science Teacher Eats McDonald\u2019s For 90 Days, Loses 37 Pounds", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/science-teacher-eats-mcdonalds-90-days-loses-37-pounds-its-our-choices-make-us-fat-not-mcdonalds", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/01/06/big-mac.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Joe Cisna, a science teacher from Iowa, lost weight after eating McDonald\u2019s for 90 days.", "title": "Science Teacher Eats McDonald\u2019s For 90 Days, Loses 37 Pounds", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/science-teacher-eats-mcdonalds-90-days-loses-37-pounds-its-our-choices-make-us-fat-not-mcdonalds", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/01/06/big-mac.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/01/06/big-mac.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Healthy Living", "published_time": "2014-01-06T13:36:17-05:00", "modified_time": "2014-01-07T11:09:39-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Joe Cisna, a science teacher from Iowa, lost weight after eating McDonald\u2019s for 90 days."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcaba0\"", "article_summary": "Science teacher John Cisna ate only McDonald's for 90 days \u2014 and lost 37 pounds.\nIt was all about choice, Cisna told KCCI News.\n\u201cI had the Big Macs, the quarter pounders with cheese,\u201d Cisna told KCCI News.\n\u201cI tell people not only can I see my shoes now, but I can also tie them,\u201d he told KCCI News.\nBut a high school science teacher at Colo-Nesco school in Iowa, Joe Cisna, chose to make an amateur documentary this year that discovered surprising results when he ate McDonald\u2019s every day for 90 days: He lost 37 lbs."}
