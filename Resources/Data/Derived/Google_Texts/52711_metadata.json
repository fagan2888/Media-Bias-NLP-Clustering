Career-oriented adults\u2014your typical \u201cworkaholic\u201d\u2014value the social status and prestige that comes with professional achievement, and derive much of their identity from their jobs. Calling-oriented people do work that they are passionate about because they want to have a positive impact on the world.\n\nIn the first empirical study into how these orientations originate, researchers found that how adolescents perceive their parents\u2019 work ethic is central to the development of their own work attitudes.\n\nIt\u2019s not a straightforward transfer of values. People who perceive their father to have a strong career-orientation are more likely to be career-oriented themselves\u2014but career-determined mothers have no effect on their kids\u2019 work orientation. The researchers attributed this to generational gender norms. When the study\u2019s participants were teenagers, mostly in the 1980s, men were more commonly employed outside of the home and were more likely than women to hold \u201ccareer\u201d jobs with opportunity for advancement.\n\nMothers do have a notable effect on whether children have a job-orientation mentality. Adolescents who are close to their mothers are less likely to view work as just a job when they grow up, probably because they\u2019ve been raised to value social, rather than instrumental, life experiences.\n\nHaving both parents display the same work ethic has an amplified influence, but only in the case of calling-oriented offspring. As our capitalist society favors money and professional achievement, a child with two calling-oriented parents is more likely to have the confidence to ignore these societal pressures and pursue her dreams.\n\nChildren can affect their parents\u2019 work ethic, too. Allowing people to bring their children into the office has been shown to boost efficiency and productivity\u2014and could help raise that next generation of career-oriented workers.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A new study from the University of Michigan finds that how we feel about work depends on how our parents feel about work.", "author": "Lauren Davidson", "og": {"site_name": "The Atlantic", "description": "A new study from the University of Michigan finds that how we feel about work depends on how our parents feel about work.", "title": "Are You a Workaholic?
