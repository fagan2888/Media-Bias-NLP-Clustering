The No. 1 song in the country, Lorde\u2019s \u201cRoyals,\u201d has dominated the rock chart for 12 weeks, spending another six weeks at the top of Alternative Songs. Aside from Paramore, Arctic Monkeys and the Neighborhood, most of the tracks on the Rock Songs list can only be called rock if you\u2019re being charitable. Capital Cities\u2019 \u201cSafe and Sound\u201d is more in the EDM tradition and Imagine Dragons\u2019 debut record was marked for its genre-hopping, the way the band blended a wide variety of musical styles to appeal to the broadest possible audience. It\u2019s less rock \u2018n\u2019 roll than musical goulash, and Lana Del Rey isn\u2019t rock at all. She\u2019s a trip-hop Nancy Sinatra.\n\nPeople who have long been predicting the death of rock music will have no difficulty finding evidence to support that thesis. Aside from niche rock stations, emerging rock artists don\u2019t get the kind of airplay or attention that they used to a decade ago, when critics credited the White Stripes for saving rock \u2018n\u2019 roll. The Stripes\u2019 \u201cWhite Blood Cells\u201d debuted in 2001, a year when momentum seemed to be shifting toward other genres. 2001 was dominated by pop-tinged R&B \u2014 between Alicia Keys\u2019 ubiquitous breakthrough hit, \u201cFallin,\u201d the Janet Jackson comeback and the rise of Jennifer Lopez. The rock songs that were popular catered to an adult contemporary crowd \u2014 with acts like Dido, Train and Uncle Kracker selling the \u201990s coffeehouse to suburban soccer moms.\n\nAlthough \u201cWhite Blood Cells\u201d flopped initially, the album quickly turned into a cultural phenomenon. It\u2019s hard to underestimate the impact of the Stripes. Hip-hop would continue to enjoy its stay in cultural prominence throughout the decade, but in 2003, albums like Outkast\u2019s genre-bending \u201cSpeakerboxx/The Love Below\u201d were joined by a staggering number of notable rock releases. 2003 saw the Strokes\u2019 \u201cRoom on Fire,\u201d the Postal Service\u2019s \u201cGive Up,\u201d Radiohead\u2019s \u201cHail to the Thief,\u201d Yeah Yeah Yeahs\u2019 \u201cFever to Tell,\u201d the Shins\u2019 \u201cChutes Too Narrow,\u201d Death Cab for Cutie\u2019s \u201cTransatlanticism\u201d and killer work from My Morning Jacket, Fountains of Wayne, Drive-By Truckers, the Rapture, Cat Power and the New Pornographers. And the Stripes themselves released \u201cElephant,\u201d a chic pick for album of the decade.\n\nAt first glance, these past few years feel a lot like 2000. In 2012 and 2013, the albums getting the lion\u2019s share of attention included releases from Kanye West, Frank Ocean, Daft Punk, Kendrick Lamar and Disclosure. Jack White moved on to more of a bluegrass sound, branching out from the genre he helped redefine, and even the bands who were big in 2003 lend a prevailing sense that rock is on life support. Outkast broke up, and Big Boi has been staying away from his rock influences ever since. The latest records from Yeah Yeah Yeahs, the Rapture and Death Cab for Cutie have all been their worst, and like TV on the Radio, My Morning Jacket were never the same after they embraced prog rock and got weird.\n\nAs is the case with Jack White\u2019s solo work, many of these bands have been eager to experiment with a new sound as the musical landscape changes, embracing trends like electronica, but rock itself has yet to discover a new paradigm.\n\nNearly every year there are critics proclaiming the genre dead, but rock more likely is undergoing an identity crisis in an industry where it\u2019s no longer king. Bands like U2 used to control the music universe, winning wide critical acclaim and selling crates of records, but in 2013, that brand of band is all but extinct. The closest we have today is Coldplay, whose last record was surprisingly heavy on pop and R&B. While Arcade Fire is bigger than ever, their newest album, produced by LCD Soundsystem\u2019s James Murphy, feels closer to \u201cSound of Silver\u201d than \u201cThe Suburbs.\u201d Just as these acts have the ability to ascend the throne, it feels as if they are abdicating rock royalty. When you look at what happened to Nirvana or Fleetwood Mac, you can understand why they didn\u2019t want it.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Maybe we haven't seen many rock blockbusters this year.
