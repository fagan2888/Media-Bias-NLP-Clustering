Dan Patrick and Leticia Van de Putte, the Republican and Democratic nominees for lieutenant governor, were front and center Saturday as they participated in back-to-back interviews at the Texas Tribune Festival.\n\nThe two candidates discussed several key issues in this election cycle, including public education funding, immigration reform and improving health care in Texas.\n\nPatrick, who took the stage first with Tribune CEO and Editor-in-Chief Evan Smith, said the state should transition from depending solely on property taxes for funding public schools and instead rely more on a sales tax.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not increasing, it\u2019s a swap,\u201d Patrick said, when asked whether this would affect his standing within the business community.\n\nWhile the Texas Legislature in 2013 restored some of the billions of dollars in public education spending it cut in 2011, Patrick said he would be apprehensive about allocating additional dollars to failed schools, adding that the state should rework the way it funds its schools.\n\nVan de Putte said that if she were lieutenant governor, she would prioritize school funding during the budget battle that develops during the legislative session by tapping the surplus in the state\u2019s coffers as it heads into the next session.\n\n\u201cI know that Texans value investment,\u201d Van de Putte said.\n\nAs he has done on the campaign trail, Patrick largely focused on immigration Saturday, insisting that Republicans are not anti-immigrant or anti-Hispanic and that instead they are working to secure the border from \u201creal threats\u201d from terrorist groups and drug cartels.\n\nHe said that while his position had drawn fire early in the campaign, more people are talking about the issue now. He also added that he supports immigration reform and a guest worker program, which he has previously said should only be enacted once the border is secure.\n\nVan de Putte did not specifically discuss border security during her interview, but she clarified that she opposes amnesty for the undocumented immigrants living in the country, countering her opponent\u2019s claims that she supports it. She also added that she believes in immigration reform that includes a pathway to citizenship for the \u201chard-working immigrants\u201d living in the state without a criminal background.\n\nShe criticized Patrick for some of the rhetoric he has used on the campaign trail, referencing Patrick\u2019s use of the term \u201cillegal invasion\u201d to describe the influx of undocumented immigrants crossing the state\u2019s southern border from Mexico.\n\nRepublicans are \"so disrespectful of people on the border that they will say anything to get a vote,\u201d Van de Putte said.\n\nOn improving health care in the state, Patrick said the system needed to be reformed through federal block grants so that Texans would have control over changes within the health care system, instead of dealing with the strings tied to federal initiatives like expanding the state\u2019s Medicaid program under the federal Affordable Care Act.\n\nVan de Putte said expanding Medicaid eligibility to cover poor, uninsured adults \u201cwould be great for Texas.\u201d\n\nShe also focused on Republican efforts to push abortion providers like Planned Parenthood out of the state by reducing funding for women\u2019s health and prohibiting affiliates of abortion providers from receiving state dollars for women\u2019s health.\n\n\u201cIn the past few years we\u2019ve seen that attack on the types of providers that women absolutely need,\u201d Van de Putte said. \u201cThey didn\u2019t care who was in the crosshairs.\u201d\n\nPatrick hit back against claims that he\u2019s been steering clear of public events since winning his primary runoff election against Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst in May.\n\n\u201cIts ridiculous,\u201d Patrick said, adding that\u2019s he\u2019s been on the road talking to leaders across the state since the runoff.\n\nDuring her interview, Van de Putte said that Texas voters should be able to question both candidates in the race ahead of the election.\n\n\u201cIf voters can\u2019t depend on their leaders to be accessible before they\u2019re elected, what kind of behavior will that instill once they\u2019re elected?\u201d she said.\n\nThe two candidates are scheduled to take part in a Sept. 29 debate in Austin.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The stark differences between state Sens.
