Diane Black was chosen last week to sit at the conference table alongside three senior lawmakers, a surprise pick that will catapult the Tennessee Republican into her highest-profile role yet.\n\nIn an interview with CQ Roll Call, Black said Speaker John A. Boehner called her early in the day on Oct. 16 to ask if she'd be interested in the position, but she didn't know it was a done deal until later that night.\n\nBlack couldn't say why exactly the Ohio Republican chose her to serve on the prestigious panel tasked with producing a budget by Dec. 13. She speculated that it had something to do with her proven track record in the Tennessee state House and Senate, her training as a nurse and her experience in the business community.\n\n\u201cMy past performances should indicate that I am someone who is willing to sit in a meeting and listen to the other side, and that I have been in positions before where I dealt with some very serious issues of setting budgets,\u201d she said.\n\nRep. Renee Ellmers, chairwoman of the Republican Women's Policy Committee, said Black's appointment was in part because of the fallout over the image of the original men's club of House GOP negotiators.\n\n\"It unfortunately played into the message that's out there from the left that Republicans do not look at women's issues as vital for America to move forward,\" Ellmers told CQ Roll Call.\n\nThe North Carolina Republican said that the episode became a \"teachable moment\" for her party's leaders. At a recent all-members meeting, Ellmers confronted them about the decision to put eight men but none of the 19 House Republican women in the media spotlight.\n\n\"[Boehner] literally got up and said, 'You know what, Renee, that was a mistake,'\" Ellmers recalled. \"And I believe that it was just a very innocent mistake, and I don't think they realized how that looked.\n\n\"I believe it is not a mistake that will be made again.\"\n\nAside from the woman factor, Ellmers called Black \"an incredible voice for policy\" whose grasp of fiscal matters and eye for detail will make her a strong player at the table.\n\nAnd Black's appointment might have been strategic on other fronts as well.\n\nBoehner's three other choices for budget conferees were obvious ones: Rep. Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin is chairman of the Budget Committee, Rep. Tom Price of Georgia is the vice chairman of the Budget Committee with strong ties to the party's conservative wing, and Rep. Tom Cole of Oklahoma is an appropriator and a key Boehner ally.\n\nBlack hails from the iconoclastic class of 2010, whose members would have clamored for \u201cone of their own\u201d to serve on the budget conference. She's also a team player who, like other mainstream House Republicans, wants to rewrite entitlement programs and exclude tax increases as part of any budget deal. Leadership can probably trust her not to stray too far from the party line.\n\nBoehner spokesman Michael Steel said Black is the perfect marriage of all the right criteria: \u201cAs a member of both the Ways and Means and Budget committees \u2014 and part of the House GOP\u2019s historic class of 2010 \u2014 Rep. Black brings a hard-nosed, common-sense perspective to this group.\"\n\nRyan, in an emailed statement, called her a \u201ckey member\u201d of the Budget Committee and a \u201cleader for entitlement reform.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know every member of the budget conference will benefit from her knowledge and dedication,\u201d Ryan said.\n\nBlack has had a charmed professional life since arriving in Washington, D.C., in 2010. Her freshman colleagues picked her to serve as their representative on the Republican Policy Committee, the National Republican Congressional Committee put her in charge of communication outreach, and leaders gave her plum committee slots.\n\nHer appeal at the outset was due in large part to her status as a polished politician coming into office in a pool of political newcomers.\n\nA 12-year veteran of the Tennessee state legislature, she ultimately climbed the ranks to be GOP caucus chairwoman of the state Senate. She uses her background as a nurse in her arguments against Obamacare and abortion. The founder of Aegis Sciences Corp. with her husband, she can talk the talk on jobs and the economy. She is No. 14 on Roll Call's 50 Richest Members of Congress list, with a minimum net worth of nearly $25 million.\n\nDuring the 2010 campaign, she doled out contributions to more than a dozen Republican candidates.\n\nSpeaking with CQ Roll Call, Black acknowledged that she has been given \u201cincredible opportunities to be in places to be in important conversations.\u201d\n\nShe also stressed that just because people outside the insular world of Capitol Hill hadn't noticed her before, it doesn't mean she wasn't always there, clocking long hours and focusing on the tasks at hand.\n\n\u201cI do know there will be more recognition, and what I can say about that is I just plan on working as hard as I can,\u201d Black said. \u201cI just want to let folks know, it\u2019s not my first time at the table.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "When House Republicans set up a photo-op amid the shutdown of their people ready to sit down and negotiate with the Senate, eight men with rolled-up shirtsleeves sat at a long table before the cameras.", "og": {"site_name": "Roll Call", "description": "When House Republicans set up a photo-op amid the shutdown of their people ready to sit down and negotiate with the Senate, eight men with rolled-up shirtsleeves sat at a long table before the cameras.", "title": "Boehner Finds the Woman for the Job", "url": "http://www.rollcall.com/news/policy/diane-black-continues-rise-with-budget-conference", "image": {"identifier": "http://cdn.videos.rollcall.com/blogs/sites/2/2013/10/immigration009_061213-330x219.jpg", "type": "image/png"}, "updated_time": "2013-10-22T20:07:52Z", "type": "website"}, "abstract": "When House Republicans set up a photo-op amid the shutdown of their people ready to sit down and negotiate with the Senate, eight men with rolled-up shirtsleeves sat at a long table before the cameras.", "fb": {"app_id": 1383531991672364}, "keywords": "Blog ID,Author,author,category,category,category,CQToday Topic,federal-budget,john-boehner,national-debt,budg", "article": {"section": "policy", "published_time": "2013-10-22T20:07:52Z", "modified_time": "2013-10-22T20:07:52Z"}, "twitter": {"description": "When House Republicans set up a photo-op amid the shutdown of their people ready to sit down and negotiate with the Senate, eight men with rolled-up shirtsleeves sat at a long table before the camera", "title": "Boehner Finds the Woman for the Job", "url": "http://www.rollcall.com/news/policy/diane-black-continues-rise-with-budget-conference", "image": {"src": "http://cdn.videos.rollcall.com/blogs/sites/2/2013/10/immigration009_061213-330x219.jpg"}, "site": "@rollcall", "card": "summary |player (See: https://dev.twitter.com/cards/types/player We will have to submit a test and get approval before using this type)"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe28eb\"", "article_summary": "\"[Boehner] literally got up and said, 'You know what, Renee, that was a mistake,'\" Ellmers recalled.\nAt a recent all-members meeting, Ellmers confronted them about the decision to put eight men but none of the 19 House Republican women in the media spotlight.\nBoehner's three other choices for budget conferees were obvious ones: Rep.
