Baltimore Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake announced today that she was lifting a 10 p.m. to 5 a.m. curfew in the city imposed nearly a week ago amid civil unrest over the death of Freddie Gray from injuries sustained in police custody.

"I want to thank the people of Baltimore for their patience," she said.

The emergency curfew was put in place after riots that took place in West Baltimore on Monday.

The decision to end the restriction comes after Friday's announcement of criminal charges against six officers involved in Gray's arrest by Baltimore State's Attorney Marilyn Mosby.

The Baltimore Sun says that a spokesman from Gov. Larry Hogan's office said the Maryland National Guard, which was deployed to the city in the wake of the violence, would be gradually drawn down in the coming days.

Baltimore Police spokesman J. Eric Kowalczyk says since the unrest began that police have made a total of 486 arrests. Saturday night, he said, 46 people were arrested — 42 adults and four minors.

"Over the weekend we've seen peace. Our focus is on asking people to remain peaceful," Kowalczyk said.

At an afternoon news conference, Hogan — who has appeared at times to be at odds with Rawlings-Blake over the handling of the situation in Baltimore — said, "The mayor and I both talked and we think that it's time to get the community going again."

He said that 1,000 extra police and 3,000 Maryland National Guard personnel had been deployed to Baltimore at the height of the problems and that "it's going to take awhile to get things back together," but added that "I think it's a good idea" to lift the curfew.
