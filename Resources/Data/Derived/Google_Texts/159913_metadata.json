It seems the convenient store has turned over a new, healthy leaf with the help of P90X creator, Tony Horton. The convenient store chain and Horton have co-developed \u201ca line of nutritionally balanced foods and cold-pressed juices for its on-the-go customers\u201d based in Los Angeles.\n\n\u201cTony Horton is one of the biggest names in the world of health and fitness,\u201d Raja Doddala, 7\u2011Eleven\u2019s senior director of Innovation, said in a press release. \u201cHis passion for reaching people and improving their quality of life inspired us at 7\u2011Eleven to offer our guests fresh, upscale selections. Tony has been super to work with as we developed healthy, great-tasting, on-the-go choices.\u201d\n\nThis Horton-inspired menu has been a year in the making, and the end result will include sandwiches, wraps, salads, and cold-pressed juices. Not going to lie, a lot of it sounds like what we would reach for: a spicy quinoa salad with chimichurri dressing; spicy black bean hummus and vegetables wrap; and green juice on juice on juice. And as far as nutrition, each option costs an average of 360 calories.\n\nAccording to the press release, meals are made with \u201call-natural ingredients from Fresh Grill of Santa Ana, the FDA- and USDA-certified commissary that prepares other fresh foods for Southern California 7\u2011Eleven stores.\u201d The menu varies between $4.75 and $6.50, while each 16-ounce bottle of juice is $4.99.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m absolutely thrilled that Tony Horton Kitchen and the 7\u2011Eleven Innovation Team came together to create wholesome, delicious, affordable choices,\u201d Horton said. \u201cThese salads, sandwiches, wraps and juices are for customers who are looking for healthier options on the go. I truly believe that this joint venture between THK and 7\u2011Eleven can be a tipping point to improve America\u2019s health.\u201d\n\nPrior to this launch, the healthier foods were only available through home delivery. Now that the convenient chain is testing them out in their Los Angeles stores, we\u2019re curious how long it will be before they\u2019re available in additional chains across the nation. That\u2019s assuming their customers even go for it. What if it\u2019s another case of Satisfries? You know, the healthier French fry Burger King created for health-conscious customers\u2026 and stopped selling in two-thirds of their chain stores within a year due to low sales?\n\nBut, we will say this: science is on 7-Eleven\u2019s side. Having a choice among health and non-healthy foods (Doritos loaded, for example), rather than a limited selection of healthy foods, encourages customers to stick with their healthy eating plan.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "7, eleven, partners, tony, horton, get, quinoa, cold, pressed, juice, craze", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "A new, healthy menu has debuted at select 7-Eleven Stores in Los Angeles.", "title": "7-Eleven Hopes To Lure Healthy Eaters With Quinoa And Juice", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/7-eleven-partners-tony-horton-get-quinoa-cold-pressed-juice-craze-306115", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/10/02/tony-horton.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A new, healthy menu has debuted at select 7-Eleven Stores in Los Angeles.", "title": "7-Eleven Hopes To Lure Healthy Eaters With Quinoa And Juice", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/7-eleven-partners-tony-horton-get-quinoa-cold-pressed-juice-craze-306115", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/10/02/tony-horton.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/10/02/tony-horton.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Consumer News", "published_time": "2014-10-02T14:47:16-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-10-02T14:47:15-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "A new, healthy menu has debuted at select 7-Eleven Stores in Los Angeles."}, "article_summary": "\u201cI\u2019m absolutely thrilled that Tony Horton Kitchen and the 7\u2011Eleven Innovation Team came together to create wholesome, delicious, affordable choices,\u201d Horton said.\nIt seems the convenient store has turned over a new, healthy leaf with the help of P90X creator, Tony Horton.\n\u201cTony Horton is one of the biggest names in the world of health and fitness,\u201d Raja Doddala, 7\u2011Eleven\u2019s senior director of Innovation, said in a press release.\nNot going to lie, a lot of it sounds like what we would reach for: a spicy quinoa salad with chimichurri dressing; spicy black bean hummus and vegetables wrap; and green juice on juice on juice.\nThe convenient store chain and Horton have co-developed \u201ca line of nutritionally balanced foods and cold-pressed juices for its on-the-go customers\u201d based in Los Angeles."}
