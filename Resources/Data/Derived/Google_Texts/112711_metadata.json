A Republican judge assigned the special prosecutor, Michael McCrum, to the case. And McCrum is no Democratic loyalist. He was a federal prosecutor in the George H.W. Bush administration and had the support of Senator John Cornyn and former Senator Kay Bailey Hutchinson, both Republicans, to become the U.S. Attorney for the Western District of Texas. (He eventually withdrew his nomination.)\n\nSo, why is he bringing this case, if it is so obviously flawed? We don\u2019t know yet, because we haven\u2019t seen the evidence. But one answer could be that it isn\u2019t actually flawed. Perry is already walking a fine line here. Few would argue that it\u2019s inappropriate for him to use his executive power as leverage to extract concessions from Democrats, particularly given Lehmberg\u2019s arrest. But if he used it to install a Republican that would block corruption investigations of his political allies, that \u201cwould be a lot more serious,\u201d as Axelrod noted Tuesday. And that may not be farfetched: As The New Republic\u2019s Alec MacGillis wrote Sunday, that fits with Perry\u2019s modus operandi. There are also reports that Perry\u2019s aides offered to restore the Public Integrity Unit\u2019s funding if Lehmberg resigned\u2014and then find her another high-paying job in the District Attorney\u2019s office. If that proves true, it could be damming.\n\nFor his part, Jeffrey Toobin, a legal analyst for the New Yorker, thinks Perry is in trouble. \u201cWhat Perry did was obvious,\u201d he wrote yesterday. \u201cThe Governor was using his leverage to jam a political adversary\u2014not exactly novel behavior in Texas, or most other states.\u201d Perry\u2019s problem, Toobin writes, is that his actions, while widely used, may be technically illegal under Texas law. Once prosecutors bring the case, he argued, \u201ccourts respond to the argument that \u201ceveryone does it\u201d more or less the same way that your mother did. It\u2019s no excuse.\u201d\n\nGiven all of this, it seems clear that the national press has written off these charges prematurely. We\u2019ll have to await the actual evidence to know for sure. If it\u2019s weak, Perry could receive a nice national bounce as the primary season nears. But if not, Perry\u2019s mug shot could be the last time he\u2019s smiling for quite a while.\n\n\u2014Danny Vinik\n\nOther news from Tuesday:\n\nFERGUSON: At least 47 people were arrested Tuesday night as protests continued in Ferguson. However, the police did not use tear gas and no one threw any Molotov cocktails, according to Captain Ron Johnson. More protests are planned for Wednesday morning. (Alan Blinder and Campbell Robertson, New York Times)\n\nHEALTH CARE: Newly released data suggests that health care prices are still rising at historically low rates. As Adrianna McIntyre explains, that's good news for Obamacare\u2014and for every American who has to pay medical bills. (Vox)\n\nOBAMACARE: Want proof the issue is losing its political bite? Republicans aren't making it a focus of their attack ads anymore. (Heidi Przbyla, Bloomberg)\n\nBORDER CRISIS: A Honduras morgue director told the Los Angeles Times that between five and ten migrant children deported from the U.S. have been killed since February. In that time, the morgue has seen 42 dead children. (Esther Yu-Hsi Lee, ThinkProgress)\n\nDROUGHT: Los Angeles is adding additional inspectors to issue citations to water-wasters as California\u2019s drought worsens. They may need more than just manpower: Out of 1,400 reports of water violations, not a single person has yet been fined. (Los Angeles Times)\n\nArticles worth reading:\n\nPoliticize Ferguson? Absolutely. Paul Waldman wants liberals to seize on the controversy, in order to focus public attention on issues like inequality and the militarization of the police. (The Plum Line)\n\nWe need more people to examine dead bodies. Seriously, there's a shortage of qualified pathologists and medical examiners. Read Tara Culp-Ressler for details. (ThinkProgress)\n\nLocal isn\u2019t always better: Paul Ryan argued that events in Ferguson should be decided by local law enforcement who have the most \u201cexpertise.\u201d Yes, the same local law enforcement that have made one mistake after another the past week.
