UnitedHealth (UNH) had 795,000 exchange customers at the end of Q1, but has said it will exit all but a \u201chandful\u201d of states in 2017.\n\nTotal exchange sign-ups rose 8.5% to 12.7 million, from 11.7 million a year ago, but it\u2019s not yet clear how many people actually paid. Last year, 1.5 million had dropped out by the end of March.\n\nReports from six states show that ObamaCare enrollment has shrunk about 14% from the number reported in February, but it\u2019s unclear if that trend will hold.\n\nAetna management expressed optimism that its exchange business will break even in 2016, though it\u2019s still getting a feel for the medical costs of this year\u2019s members, given the relatively large amount of customer churn from year to year.\n\nOverall, Aetna\u2019s ObamaCare-compliant enrollment, including off-exchange customers, fell to 1.2 million from 1.275 million a year ago.\n\nAetna CEO Mark Bertolini said he sees the exchange business as a good investment for the company, despite modest losses so far, provided that Congress and the next president are able to set politics aside and modify the program, as they do for Medicare and Medicaid on a pretty regular basis.\n\nAetna shares rose modestly on the stock market today on stronger-than-expected Q1 results.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Aetna reported 911,000 ObamaCare exchange members as of March 31, down more than 4% from over 950,000 at the same time a year ago.", "og": {"site_name": "Investor's Business Daily", "description": "Aetna reported 911,000 ObamaCare exchange members as of March 31, down more than 4% from over\u00a0950,000 at the same time a year ago.
