The Republican National Committee has been trying to make a national issue out of Uber, the pseudo-taxi service smartphone app that has experienced explosive growth and many local regulatory fights.\n\nIt hasn\u2019t always been about Uber, specifically, but rather the larger issue of disruptive upstart companies undermining the legitimacy of the existing regulatory state. A growing number of Republicans believe this battle can be used to make serious inroads with a younger demographic, which currently skews heavily Democratic.\n\nTHE PEER-TO-PEER ECONOMY\n\nThe phrase that pays with venture capitalists and Silicon Valley investors nowadays is \u201cthe peer-to-peer economy.\u201d Much has been written about this emerging business model but it can be boiled down to this: Entrepreneurs are using the Internet to connect people directly to each other to exchange goods and services. Think about how eBay lets users sell directly to each other, or how StubHub connects live event fans to re-sell tickets.\n\nWhat the peer-to-peer economy does, among other things, is circumvent the government. Re-sold products don\u2019t have to pass safety inspections. Craigslist transactions often pass under the nose of the IRS. But it\u2019s not clear that any of these services are more unsafe than, say, pawnshops or garage sales. Peer-to-peer apps just make these things easier and more available on a wider scale. The Internet makes a yard sale available to the entire country.\n\nNearly every industry has a \u201csharing\u201d aspect to it now. EatWith is an app for non-professional chefs to welcome guests into their home. 1000 Tools allows those with home projects to borrow tools from each other rather than renting or buying from a big-box store. TaskRabbit can help you find amateur contractors and other home services. Airbnb lets hosts rent out rooms or their entire homes on a short-term basis to visitors. But the granddaddy of them all\u2014the biggest company and the biggest lightning rod in the industry\u2014is Uber.\n\nUber is a private car service that competes with traditional taxicabs but with the convenience of a smartphone. You sign up for an account, enter credit card information, and the service will use your phone\u2019s location to find a nearby car. Often, in less than 10 minutes, a car will be at your door.\n\nThere are a few different levels of service with Uber. The Black Car service is similar to a private limo service\u2014high-end vehicles, privacy, trained drivers. But Uber\u2019s political opponents object most to its UberX service\u2014something closer to ridesharing in which anyone could use their own car to become an Uber driver.\n\nEmphasis on could though. Uber has repeatedly stressed that they take Social Security numbers and do extensive background checks on all applicants for the ridesharing service. Its critics contend that the safety checks Uber does aren\u2019t enough.\n\nIn Boston, for example, the Boston Taxi Drivers\u2019 Association implored the mayor of Boston to institute orders to \u201cregulate and license\u201d Uber drivers and vehicles, saying that it was necessary for the \u201cpublic well-being, convenience, and safety.\u201d Uber also faces a lawsuit from Boston Cab Dispatch, among others, for violating multiple federal and state laws.\n\nThe ridesharing company has been intermittently prohibited from operation in Los Angeles, Washington, D.C., Virginia, and other places. It\u2019s banned throughout the country of Germany, and in London, England.\n\nAnd it faces lawsuits in San Francisco, Chicago, and in Boston, mostly from the entrenched union interests that are threatened.\n\nAdversity from local politicians and regulators is something all these peer-to-peer startups are facing. Airbnb was outlawed in San Francisco until earlier this year when the city council passed an \u201cAirbnb law\u201d intended to regulate and tax the entire enterprise of short-term rentals. Businessweek reported on New York City\u2019s regulation of EatWith, as a Health Department spokesperson firmly stated, \u201cThe city does not allow meals to be served to members of the public in someone\u2019s home.\u201d\n\nWHO'S IN ON IT\n\nA 2014 survey from Vision Critical and Crowd Companies found that the percentage of Americans participating in the peer-to-peer economy is still quite small: less than 1 in 4 Americans have used a peer-to-peer service and that includes purchasing from some relatively established websites like eBay. Low participation rates persist for married people and people with children.\n\nBut that is also what makes current peer-to-peer users so politically appealing to Republicans: They are young. Nearly half of all 18-34 year-olds are participants in the peer-to-peer economy.\n\nSo unlike highway funding or investment taxes, the impacts of regulations on the peer-to-peer economy are immensely visible to these voters. When regulators impose taxes on Uber, or when they outlaw Airbnb, there are consequences on young peoples\u2019 day-to-day lives. Young people, if it needs mentioning, are a demographic that the Democratic Party has had a stranglehold on for a long time, and are a key component of the Obama coalition.\n\nThis is why some conservatives have decided to make Uber, the symbolic upstart at the center of political controversy, an example for why and how Republicans should nurture innovative, disruptive companies. The Republican National Committee has run a petition drive throughout summer and fall 2014 \u201cin support of innovative companies like Uber\u201d in order to try to make inroads with a demographic that conservatives have struggled with in the past.\n\nThe RNC has been incredibly pleased with the response. There has been an outpouring of support, and press coverage has been positive and intrigued by the RNC\u2019s pro-technology push.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t overstress the importance of finding a real-life example for us to contrast what we believe in with what the other party believes in,\u201d RNC spokeswoman Kirsten Kukowski tells Townhall. \u201cThis is something that\u2019s 100 percent applicable to a lot of people\u2019s lives, especially as Uber continues to expand. It\u2019s not just Uber \u2026 it\u2019s Lyft, it\u2019s food trucks, it\u2019s Airbnb.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of these innovative companies that, if government got out of the way, we would have a real shot at a free market.\u201d\n\nGOVERNMENT DOESN'T GET OUT OF THE WAY\n\nIt\u2019s that \u201cgovernment getting out of the way\u201d part that these disruptive peer-to-peer companies struggle so mightily with, especially because Democrats control some of the big urban centers where the companies are trying to get off the ground.\n\nOn July 1st of this year, a judge shut down Uber\u2019s operations in Pittsburgh, ruling that the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission\u2019s concerns over \u201cpublic safety\u201d were enough to halt the ridesharing operations (An Uber competitor, Lyft, was also shut down in the ruling). Across the state in Philadelphia, a different ridesharing service called Sidecar has been prohibited from operations since 2013, after the Philadelphia Parking Authority deemed it to be an illegal taxi service.\n\nSidecar remained shut down, but Uber and Lyft both received temporary 60-day permits to continue service in the Keystone State. And after a contentious summer, Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Corbett, a Republican, publicly voiced his support for the ridesharing companies.\n\nThis doesn\u2019t always break down cleanly along partisan lines. The Democratic mayor of Pittsburgh has long pushed for the legalized operation of some of these ridesharing companies. What it is, however, is an easy-to-grasp example of regulation harming upstart businesses to protect unionized incumbents.\n\n\u201cEveryone\u2019s in favor of small business,\u201d an aide on the House Small Business Committee tells Townhall. \u201cIt\u2019s something you see broadly as a split between the two parties. \u2026 Republicans do, especially in our committee, take the position that we don\u2019t want to over regulate and stifle innovation before we know what they\u2019re doing.\n\n\u201cI think that Republicans don\u2019t want to crush innovation before it starts.\n\n\u201cAppreciation for small business is not a partisan issue; both Democrats and Republicans agree on the importance of these firms and great innovation that comes from these firms,\u201d the aide continues. \u201cInnovative new startups are vital to economic growth and job creation, therefore we must be cautious that we do not create inappropriate barriers to entry or regulatory hurdles.\n\n\u201cFrom a Republican perspective, one thing that remains quite clear is that government needs to allow them to prosper rather than stifle their innovation with overregulation from the start.\u201d\n\nSCALING UP\n\nAll of this sounds fine; but how do national-level Republicans take advantage of what has been, so far, policy that is the purview of local and state regulation? Can a presidential contender really make hay out of local taxi regulations?\n\n\u201cCurrently, much of the debate surrounding which laws and regulations to subject these new businesses and their services and products to is occurring at the state and local level,\u201d the House aide says. \u201cAnd although in the future as these firms grow and become involved in interstate commerce the federal government may have a role to play; we should carefully watch how it plays out at the state and local level to see what is beneficial or what is burdensome rather than prematurely erecting more barriers to entry at a federal level.\u201d\n\nRep. Sam Graves (R-MO), as the chair of the House Small Business Committee, has been making sure members of Congress are aware of this emerging segment of the economy. In January, the committee held a hearing on peer-to-peer businesses, with representatives from Sidecar and 1000 Tools. In that hearing, they provided members of Congress with a broad base of information on how these sharing companies are transforming the economy, and the necessity for a light hand when it comes to regulation.\n\nWhile conservatives hash out their peer-to-peer policy prescriptions, many progressives have begun uniting in an anti-peer-to-peer movement. Progressive economist Dean Baker wrote \u201cDon\u2019t Buy The Hype: Airbnb and Uber Are Bad For the Economy.\u201d The Huffington Post published \u201c5 Very Good Reasons Why I\u2019m Not On Board With Uber.\u201d And the always reliable liberal Salon had a screed titled \u201cWhy Uber Must Be Stopped,\u201d which described the peer-to-peer economy as a form of \u201cunrestrained hypercapitalism.\u201d\n\nThe price of doing business, these progressives believe, is for these new peer-to-peer companies to play by the same regulations and pay the same taxes that their incumbent competitions does. They simply don\u2019t believe that people can safely engage in free economic transactions. They cannot conceive of a world in which people voluntarily coordinate and look out for each other without government coercion. Also, of course, they parrot union talking points about how the incumbent, monopolistic, over-regulated unions are the \u201csafe\u201d option.\n\nIt\u2019s these barriers to entry that conservatives can seize upon. Government is in the business of creating barriers to entry. Conservatives should be about preserving an environment in which startups can flourish.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a borderline lifestyle thing,\u201d says Grover Norquist, president of Americans for Tax Reform and a grassroots activist. \u201cYou are a different person because you like Uber. And the other team wants to shut it down. \u2026 All the Democrats can think about is how to tax it. How we can sue it. We don\u2019t like it because the people who do it can\u2019t be unionized.\u201d\n\nDISRUPTION AND INCUMBENCY\n\nWhat\u2019s also playing out is a bitter fight among these new companies. Uber is the big boy on the ridesharing block, but Lyft, Sidecar, and other services are trying to compete on that turf. These companies aren\u2019t just fighting the incumbent taxi cartels; they\u2019re beginning to fight against each other.\n\nLyft, underdog in the fight, has alleged anticompetitive practices on the part of Uber. They claim Uber has \u201crecruiters\u201d who book short trips with their drivers, then attempt to recruit those drivers during those trips. This may be aggressive, but not necessarily malicious. Headhunting happens in the professional world all the time.\n\nBut Lyft also alleges that Uber recruiters have booked thousands of Lyft trips, only to cancel on those drivers before pick-up. This tactic is designed to tie up Lyft drivers, making waits longer for real customers, while keeping Uber\u2019s lines of communication open and giving Uber the advantage among consumers.\n\nUber denies the charges of malice, but it\u2019s important for pro-innovation conservatives not to be pro-incumbent. In the niche-specific ridesharing market, Uber is the big company. It may be the case that Lyft is making false allegations to curry public opinion against a big company, but the size of the company doesn\u2019t merit defense on its own.\n\nAnother concern is that Uber could agree to regulatory rules, which would allow its operation in many markets that would nonetheless erect smaller barriers to entry that competitors can\u2019t meet. Cities are eager to be seen as \u201cpro-Uber,\u201d but compromises that allow the operation and regulation of some upstarts may serve to keep others out. Uber, as the largest company, has the investment capital that would allow it to clear some regulatory hurdles and operate as a pseudo-monopoly in a few different markets. Sidecar, for example, has still been shut out of more markets than either Lyft or Uber\u2014erecting more barriers to entry might mean a death knell.\n\nWHERE PEER-TO-PEER IS GOING\n\n\u201cThe petition was our trial balloon,\u201d says Kukowski. \u201cThe success that we\u2019ve had shows us where the public and where the voters are on this subject. \u2026 We\u2019re going to continue to look for opportunities to talk to voters about things like this.\n\n\u201cSometimes, as a party, we struggle to find real-life examples that people are in tune with to show the contrast between the two parties.\u201d\n\nA pro-innovation stance on peer-to-peer companies doesn\u2019t necessarily have to be a vote-moving issue to make a difference. But it is definitely something a party that has struggled to connect with younger voters can use to start a longer conversation about the downsides to the existing and ever-expanding regulatory state.\n\n\u201cWhen I get to talk to young people on Uber versus the taxi cabs, free markets versus government regulation, everybody nods. Everybody gets it,\u201d Norquist says. \u201cCareers will be ended. City council members who voted against Uber at any point, when they run for Congress, this will be a death knell. \u2026 I think this will destroy a number of careers, for people who started as anti-Uber guys not knowing it was going to be a problem.\u201d\n\nWill Republicans truly be able to use the peer-to-peer economy to make electoral inroads with the young and urban demographics that they\u2019ve traditionally underperformed with? That\u2019s tough to say. Changing voters\u2019 perceptions of the parties and which issues are important takes time. In the short term, though, it\u2019s important to get the policy right.\n\nThese disruptive services are incredibly popular in the places that they operate, and even usually pro-regulation politicians have had to make concessions. No matter which party benefits, that\u2019s a win for economic freedom.", "article_metadata": {"description": "How the Republican Party is using the peer-to-peer economy to reach out to traditionally Democratic voters..05/25/2016 20:28:03PM EST.", "author": "Kevin Glass", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "How the Republican Party is using the peer-to-peer economy to reach out to traditionally Democratic voters.", "title": "Kevin Glass - Uber Republicans", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/kevinglass/2014/11/04/uber-republicans-n1913656", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/uploads/2014/11/3/5.png", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "How the Republican Party is using the peer-to-peer economy to reach out to traditionally Democratic voters.", "title": "Kevin Glass - Uber Republicans", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/kevinglass/2014/11/04/uber-republicans-n1913656", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/uploads/2014/11/3/5.png", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Uber Republicans, Kevin Glass, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0ad5\"", "article_summary": "Uber has repeatedly stressed that they take Social Security numbers and do extensive background checks on all applicants for the ridesharing service.\nThis is why some conservatives have decided to make Uber, the symbolic upstart at the center of political controversy, an example for why and how Republicans should nurture innovative, disruptive companies.\nSidecar remained shut down, but Uber and Lyft both received temporary 60-day permits to continue service in the Keystone State.\nUber is a private car service that competes with traditional taxicabs but with the convenience of a smartphone.\nBut Lyft also alleges that Uber recruiters have booked thousands of Lyft trips, only to cancel on those drivers before pick-up."}
