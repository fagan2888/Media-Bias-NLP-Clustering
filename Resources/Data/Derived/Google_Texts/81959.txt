Whether you need a particular form for your business or help in managing your risks, you can quickly and easily find what you need with the new Forms & Resources and the Manage Your Risks interactive online downloads from the American Rental Association (ARA).

“These downloads, which are free to ARA members, cover a variety of topics, from policies and procedures, employees and equipment to your facilities and customers — pertinent areas that impact your business on a daily basis,” says Carla Brozick, CAE, ARA senior director of education and training. “All are designed for immediate and easy access. Many can be customized to your operation, which is an added benefit.”

“These downloads are very handy,” says Donna Berryman, CERP, vice president of Berryman d/b/a Superior Equipment & Events in Houghton, Mich. “We’re a small business, so we don’t have a special HR department. I am it. Having these resources at your fingertips is very helpful as we are so busy running our day-to-day activities that we forget about the things that make our business excellent — following some specific policies and procedures. These remind us of the important things we need to implement in

our business.”

Berryman wishes she would have accessed these downloads when she was going through a recent hiring process at her business.

“There are certain laws pertaining to what you can and cannot ask a potential employee — things you need to know. Even the application form would have been beneficial. We are not done with our hiring, so I will look at these more closely,” she says, noting that some of the forms might also be of benefit as she trains her new employees.

These downloads are located in two sections of the ARA website:
