Nostalgia and retro culture burn as brightly today as they did in the era of \u201cHappy Days\u201d and \u201cAmerican Graffiti,\u201d while distrust and suspicion of government hover at near-Watergate levels. Disaster dreams are everywhere, just as they were in the days of \u201cThe Towering Inferno\u201d and Three Mile Island. The culture wars, the 1970s\u2019 No. 1 gift to American politics, still drag on and on, while the New Right, the decade\u2019s other great political invention, effortlessly rejuvenates itself. Jerry Brown is governor of California again. The Kansas City Royals are a good team.\n\nNo reminiscence of that decade of malaise would be complete without mentioning Jimmy Carter, the president who\u2014fairly or not\u2014will be forever associated with national drift and decline and all the other horrors that were eventually swept away by the Reagan magisterium. Indeed, comparing the hapless Carter to whoever currently leads the Democratic Party remains a powerful shibboleth for American conservatives, and in 2011 and 2012 Republicans indulged in this favorite simile without hesitation.\n\nI pretty much ignored the Carter-Obama comparison in those days because it was so manifestly empty\u2014a partisan insult based on nothing but the lousy economy faced by both Carter and Obama as well as the recurring problem of beleaguered American embassies in the Muslim world. (Get it? Benghazi=Tehran!) More important for Republican purposes was the memory that Jimmy Carter lost his re-election campaign, which they creatively merged with their hopes that Obama would lose, too. Other than that, the comparison had little connection to actual facts; it was a waste of trees and precious pixels.\n\nWhat has changed my mind about the usefulness of the comparison is my friend Rick Perlstein\u2019s vast and engrossing new history of the \u201970s, \u201cThe Invisible Bridge.\u201d The book\u2019s main subject is the rise of Ronald Reagan, but Perlstein\u2019s detailed description of Carter\u2019s run for the presidency in 1976 evokes more recent events so startlingly that the comparison with Obama is impossible to avoid. After talking over the subject with Perlstein (watch this space for the full interview), I am more startled by the similarities than ever.\n\nIn 1976, when Carter shocked the political world by beating a field of better-known politicians for the Democratic presidential nomination, the essence of his appeal was pure idealism\u2014idealism without ideology, even. He presented himself, Perlstein writes, as an \u201cantipolitician,\u201d a figure of reconciliation who could restore our best qualities after the disasters of Vietnam and Watergate.\n\nJimmy Carter\u2019s actual politics were ambiguous, however, in a way that should be very familiar. His speechwriter James Fallows wrote in 1979 that he initially signed up with the candidate out of a hope that he \u201cmight look past the tired formulas of left and right and offer something new.\u201d As with Barack Obama, who promised to bring a post-partisan end to Washington squabbling, Jimmy Carter\u2019s idealism was not a matter of policies or political ideas but rather of the candidate as a person, a transcendent figure of humility and uprightness.\n\nIdealists of all kinds saw what they wanted to see in Jimmy Carter in 1976. Just as Barack Obama is, famously, a \u201cblank screen on which people of vastly different political stripes project their own views,\u201d so presidential candidate Jimmy Carter tried to be \u201call things to all people,\u201d Perlstein writes. Carter denounced elites in a memorable way in his speech to the Democratic convention that year, but when asked where he stood on the political spectrum, according to an article Perlstein quotes from The New York Times, Carter would say things like, \u201cI don\u2019t like to categorize, I don\u2019t see myself as liberal or conservative or the like\u201d\u2014then proceed to suggest that he was a little of both.\n\nNevertheless, liberals in 1976 steadfastly maintained that Carter was one of them\u2014to the utter exasperation of the journalists who had studied Carter\u2019s statements and positions over the years. The man from Plains, Georgia, was no progressive, the journalists argued. But in those days, nothing was capable of shaking the faith of his disciples.\n\nThat faith was something to behold. \u201cThey yearned to believe,\u201d Perlstein writes of Carter\u2019s fans. Among the smitten were hardened journalists like James Wolcott and Hunter S. Thompson (!) as well as the leaders of some of the big labor unions, in those days the bulwark of American liberalism.\n\nOnce the election was over, the pundits of the day amused themselves\u2014just as they do today\u2014by speculating that the GOP was permanently done for. Today, it\u2019s demographic change that is supposed to be slowly crushing the right; back then there were similar theories. In 1977, a columnist for the Boston Globe added up all the constituencies that the GOP had alienated over the course of the decade and wrote that the \u201cGrand Old Party has begun to face the unpleasant fact that it risks becoming a permanent opposition dwarfed by a much larger ruling party.\u201d Another notion, which Perlstein describes, was the widespread belief that the rise of the Now Generation would drag the whole spectrum of opinion leftward\u2014just like millennials are expected to do today.\n\nAs president, of course, Carter wasn\u2019t much of a liberal at all. Although economic conditions were not good when he took over, the stimulus he proposed was far too small because, like another Democrat who comes to mind, Carter was always drawn to fiscal responsibility and \u201chard choices.\u201d \u201cHe has emphasized balancing the budget as if it were more important than reducing unemployment,\u201d wrote the columnist Joseph Kraft in 1977.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Liberals yearn to believe in post-ideological blank slates -- and get disappointed every time.
