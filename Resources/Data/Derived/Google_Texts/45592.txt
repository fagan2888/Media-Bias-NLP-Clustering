IBADAN, Nigeria–Nigeria will seek to renegotiate the fiscal terms of existing production-sharing contracts with some international oil and gas companies to seek more favorable terms, the new head of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corp. said.

“In the weeks and months ahead, the corporation will be renegotiating the contracts to extract as much benefits as possible for Nigeria,” said NNPC chief Ibe Kachikwu, according to a statement.

Speaking in Paris ahead of the state visit of Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari, Kachikwu said: “The NNPC is allowed to make use of the window which creates space for renegotiation.”

The major African oil exporter is facing hefty budget pressures after international oil prices plunged and as the Buhari administration looks for funds to execute an ambitious reform program. The new government had been expected to seek to renegotiate some contracts.

Since assuming office in May, Buhari has sought to overhaul the NNPC by removing its board of directors and appointing Kachiwu to lead the corporation. He vowed to stop rampant oil theft that has cost Nigeria billions of dollars.

Kachiwu’s statement didn’t say which contracts would be renegotiated. Shell, Agip and Chevron are some of the oil majors operating in Nigeria. Shell spokesman Precious Okolobo in Nigeria declined an offer to comment.

Kachikwu said some of the contracts were negotiated over 20 years ago and “they have since been overtaken by new realities in the industry.” He also said that the NNPC would ensure that the review didn’t create an “anti-investment atmosphere that may be counterproductive to the industry.”

President Buhari began a three-day official visit to France on Monday at the invitation of French President Francois Hollande.
