Income in the 2015 quarter included a charge of $40 million, or 14 cents a share, for transaction costs related to Cigna's proposed merger with Anthem.\n\nExcluding certain items, earnings from operations rose to an adjusted $2.32 a share from $1.96 a share.\n\nRevenue rose 4.4% to $9.88 billion.\n\nAnalysts polled by Thomson Reuters had projected earnings of $2.15 a share on $10 billion in revenue.\n\nCigna said its medical-loss ratio, or the share of premiums paid out for members' health expenses, was 86.2% for its government-based business, which the company attributed to strong performance in the Medicare Advantage business and improved medical costs in the Medicare Part D business. The medical-loss ratio for commercial members was 75.8%, reflecting continued strong performance of the commercial employer business.\n\nShares of Cigna, inactive premarket, have added 1.4% over the past three months, easing the year's decline to 7.8%.\n\nIn July, Anthem agreed to buy Cigna for $48 billion, capping months of merger frenzy among top U.S. health insurers. The deal combines the second- and fifth-largest health insurers by revenue and would create a company with a huge footprint in commercial insurance, the type of coverage provided to employers and consumers.\n\nThe biggest companies are seeking more cost efficiency and scale as the health-care landscape changes because of the Affordable Care Act and other factors.\n\nLast week, Aetna reported its enrollment in Affordable Care Act plans grew more than the company expected in the first quarter, but the insurer said it is still on track to roughly break even on the business this year, adding to the mixed signals from the industry about the direction of the health-law exchanges.\n\nWrite to Anne Steele at Anne.Steele@wsj.com\n\nMore from MarketWatch", "article_metadata": {"parsely-type": "post", "page.site": "marketwatch", "author": "Anne Steele", "og": {"url": "http://www.marketwatch.com/story/cigna-beats-profit-view-raises-outlook-2016-05-06", "site_name": "MarketWatch", "image": "http://mw3.wsj.net/mw5/content/logos/mw_logo_social.png", "type": "article", "title": "Cigna beats profit view, raises outlook"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=336693422", "twitter": {"domain": "marketwatch.com", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://mw3.wsj.net/mw5/content/logos/mw_mark.svg", "height": 630}, "site": {"id": 624413}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "parsely-title": "Cigna beats profit view, raises outlook", "ob": {"image": "http://mw3.wsj.net/mw5/content/logos/mw_logo_social.png"}, "robots": "noarchive,noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 283204329838}, "article.id": "0FB3EB3B-8200-4592-97B4-B566C3D93CFF", "article.content_group": "marketwatch", "parsely-author": "Anne Steele", "position": 1, "lifp_basePath": "https://id.marketwatch.com/access", "parsely-section": "MW_Industries", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/marketwatch"}, "article.section": "Industries", "parsely-link": "http://www.marketwatch.com/story/cigna-beats-profit-view-raises-outlook-2016-05-06", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "parsely-pub-date": "2016-05-06T06:46:00-04:00"}, "article_summary": "Over all for the March quarter, Cigna reported earnings of $519 million, or $2 a share, down from $533 million, or $2.04 a share, a year earlier.\nIn July, Anthem agreed to buy Cigna for $48 billion, capping months of merger frenzy among top U.S. health insurers.\nThe medical-loss ratio for commercial members was 75.8%, reflecting continued strong performance of the commercial employer business.\nShares of Cigna, inactive premarket, have added 1.4% over the past three months, easing the year's decline to 7.8%.\nFor full-year 2016, the company now expects earnings of $8.95 to $9.35, up from its previous forecast for earnings of $8.85 to $9.25 a share."}
