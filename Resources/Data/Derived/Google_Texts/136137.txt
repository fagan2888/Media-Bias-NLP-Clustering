Holds dinner, program for recipients

Elks Lodge 1336 of Sterling Exalted Ruler Mike Bartsch and officers on Wednesday welcomed the recipients of the Elks Scholarship Program for 2015 and their families with a dinner and presentation at the local Lodge. The program provides scholarships for those students who are sponsored by a grandparent who is an Elk or the father of an Elks member. The scholarships are renewable and the program has assisted many students with their education in the last 25 plus years.

This year 33 students, consisting of 2015 high school graduates and those currently attending college who renewed their past scholarships, received $400 each for college expenses. Two of the students were also recipients from the Colorado Elks Association through the Elks National Foundation.
