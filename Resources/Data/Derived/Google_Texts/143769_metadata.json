Sam Brownback said in 2013.\n\nBrownback was talking about the massive supply-side tax cuts at the center of his policy agenda, which he had promised would provide \u201ca shot of adrenaline into the heart of the Kansas economy.\u201d Instead, it led to a deep hole in the state budget, a downgrade in the state\u2019s credit rating and weak economic growth compared with neighboring states. As top income earners and business owners pocketed their tax cuts, Kansas\u2019s poverty rate went up.\n\nThe failure of Brownback\u2019s plan has made headlines not only because of its consequences in Kansas but also because of its potential impact on national politics. Brownback explicitly intended his plan to inform the policy debate in 2016 and beyond, but his gambit didn\u2019t work as planned. As The Post\u2019s editorial board wrote last year, \u201cMr. Brownback\u2019s Kansas trial is rapidly becoming a cautionary tale for conservative governors elsewhere who have blithely peddled the theology of tax cuts as a painless panacea for sluggish growth.\u201d\n\nHowever, Kansas\u2019s budget woes have overshadowed another important element of Brownback\u2019s red-state experiment: his refusal to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. In the latest issue of The Nation, features editor Kai Wright reports on the devastating consequences of that decision.\n\nAs Wright explains, Kansas has some of the most restrictive Medicaid eligibility requirements in the country. The program is available only to non-disabled adults earning less than 32 percent of the federal poverty level, and most childless adults don\u2019t qualify, regardless of income. The Affordable Care Act was supposed to raise that threshold to 138 percent, but Brownback declined to implement the Medicaid expansion. As a result, thousands of poor Kansans who would qualify for Medicaid in other states remain uninsured.\n\nBrownback has often characterized his opposition to expanding Medicaid and other poverty programs, in Wright\u2019s words, as a \u201cmoral rejection of dependency.\u201d Last June, for example, Brownback told the Heritage Foundation\u2019s Daily Signal Web site that Kansas had not expanded Medicaid because \u201cWe\u2019re trying to push people that are able-bodied right now to get a job.\u201d Similarly, Brownback pledged in his State of the State address this year to continue \u201chelping people move from dependence on the government to independence.\u201d\n\nBut, in practice, Brownback\u2019s resistance to Medicaid expansion is causing some people to move from independence to desperation. Wright spoke with several Kansans who are suffering because of Kansas\u2019s severe eligibility requirements. Far from the right-wing caricature of lazy moochers, they are hard workers who aren\u2019t looking for a handout. One woman, RaDonna, is too sick to hold down food, let alone a full-time job. Yet, as a childless adult, she doesn\u2019t qualify for Medicaid \u2014 and the state rejected her application for disability benefits. While RaDonna now lives with her sister, Cathy, she insists on helping with the laundry and dishes to earn her keep. \u201cShe can\u2019t do the whole sink full of dishes without stopping and sitting down for a while,\u201d Cathy says.\n\nThe stories from Kansas are heartbreaking, but unfortunately they are not unique. According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, \u201cNationally, nearly four million poor uninsured adults fall into the \u2018coverage gap\u2019 that results from state decisions not to expand Medicaid.\u201d Republicans have full control of the legislature in all 21 states that have not expanded the program.\n\nAs with his tax cuts, Brownback\u2019s stance toward Medicaid expansion is a reflection of the Republican Party\u2019s national agenda. In fact, the roster of likely Republican presidential candidates includes three governors \u2014 Scott Walker, Rick Perry and Bobby Jindal \u2014 who also opted out of the Medicaid expansion. Likewise, former Florida governor Jeb Bush expressed opposition to expanding Medicaid in Florida. And another prospective candidate, Ohio Gov. John Kasich, has come under attack from his fellow Republicans for embracing the expansion in his home state.\n\nFor most Republican leaders, opposing Medicaid expansion is simply a matter of ideological faith. \u201cWhy is more people on Medicaid a good thing?\u201d Walker asked last year. Echoing Brownback, he added, \u201cI\u2019d rather find a way, particularly for able-bodied adults without children, I\u2019d like to find a way to get them into the workforce. I think ideologically that\u2019s a better approach, not just as a conservative but as an American. Have more people live the American dream if they\u2019re not dependent on the American government.\u201d More recently, Walker framed his position in religious terms. \u201cMy reading of the Bible finds plenty of reminders that it\u2019s better to teach someone to fish if they\u2019re able,\u201d he said.\n\nThis \u201creal live experiment,\u201d as Brownback once put it, has resulted in the pain and suffering of many Kansans. And yet, instead of acknowledging those consequences as a warning sign, the Republican presidential candidates have embraced them as a blueprint. It\u2019s all part of the same GOP pattern \u2014 a continued retreat away from reason and toward a blind ideology \u2014 one that always comes with a body count.\n\nRead more from Katrina vanden Heuvel\u2019s archive or follow her on Twitter.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Refusing to expand Medicaid is bad medicine.
