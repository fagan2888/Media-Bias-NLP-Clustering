State and local governments pitched in another $62 million, the agency reported.\n\nIt\u2019s not a lucky happenstance, according to representatives of state and local flood agencies.\n\nColorado has benefited from the lessons learned from other states to help steer victims away from charlatans.\n\n\u201cSome of the things we did here at DORA was a result of contacting those other states,\u201d said Cory Everett, spokeswoman for Colorado Department of Regulatory Agencies.\n\nIn the wake of the floods, DORA heavily promoted it s online database of licensed contractors\n\n. The agency\u2019s inspectors provided 267 free damage assessments and recommended appropriate repairs to help victims avoid being duped by unscrupulous contractors.\n\nOther agencies and organizations did the same.\n\nThrough the end of February, the Colorado Bar Association offered the help of 284 lawyers who volunteered their services in 619 flood-related cases.\n\nThe Federal Emergency Management Agency also spent nearly $2.7 million on case managers who worked one-on-one with victims.\n\nOne of the most common scams after natural disasters is phony charities, according to the Colorado Attorney General\u2019s Office.\n\nImmediately after last fall\u2019s flood, just as he did after the state\u2019s most recent wildfires, Gov. John Hickenlooper promoted the HelpColoradoNow.org website, which steered donors to dozens of credible charities. At the same time, Secretary of State Scott Gessler publicized his office\u2019s online registry of charities.\n\nThe lag time of days or weeks after the floods before people could begin work on their homes in the hardest-hit areas gave prosecutors, government agencies and nonprofits, such as the Better Business Bureau, time to reach potential victims with information on avoiding scams, said Carolyn Tyler, a spokeswoman for the state Attorney General\u2019s Office.\n\nTyler said the office\u2019s consumer protection division received only two complaints, both about expensive hotel prices for people dislodged by the floods. Colorado, however, does not have price-gouging laws that might make that illegal.\n\n\u201cWe would like to believe we either did a good job of getting the word out to the crooks that we take fraud very seriously,\u201d she said, \u201cor we did a good job of connecting with the public on how not to be taken advantage of.\u201d\n\nReport fraud\n\nAnyone who suspects others are committing fraud of FEMA money can submit a report online at http://www.oig.dhs.gov/ or call 800-621-3362.\n\nThose who think they\u2019ve been cheated by deceptive practices can call the Colorado Attorney General\u2019s Consumer Complaint Line at 800-222-4444 or file an online complaint at coloradoattorneygeneral.gov.\n\nThe Colorado Department of Regulatory Agencies is also available to assist regarding licensed professions and occupations at 303-894-7490 or 800-930-3745 or online at askdora.colorado.gov.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "So far, Colorado has dodged wave of fraud that follows disasters", "title": "So far, Colorado has dodged wave of fraud that follows disasters", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/03/20/so-far-colorado-has-dodged-wave-of-fraud-that-follows-disasters/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140314__20140315_A6_CD15HUDFLOODp1-2.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140314__20140315_A6_CD15HUDFLOODp1-2.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-03-20T19:46:28+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-28T02:20:26+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Last September\u2019s devastating floods left Colorado with a mountain of problems, but so far fraud isn\u2019t one of them.\nThe Colorado Department of Regulatory Agencies is also available to assist regarding licensed professions and occupations at 303-894-7490 or 800-930-3745 or online at askdora.colorado.gov.\n\u201cSome of the things we did here at DORA was a result of contacting those other states,\u201d said Cory Everett, spokeswoman for Colorado Department of Regulatory Agencies.\nOne of the most common scams after natural disasters is phony charities, according to the Colorado Attorney General\u2019s Office.\nColorado has benefited from the lessons learned from other states to help steer victims away from charlatans."}
