The attendants tried to pull her to safety, but Xiang fell into the mechanism and was killed.\n\nThe state-run People's Daily's online edition and other media outlets said her body was recovered four hours later, after crews disassembled the escalator.\n\nAlthough escalator deaths are extremely rare, China's breakneck economic development and sometimes cavalier attitude toward safety, quality control and maintenance have led to frequent industrial accidents such as fires, building and bridge collapses, and ship sinkings or collisions.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Chinese woman dies after trapped in escalator, but saves son - AP News: BEIJING (AP) \u2014 A Chinese woman died after being trapped .05/26/2016 4:38:28AM EST.", "author": "AP News", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "BEIJING (AP) \u2014 A Chinese woman died after being trapped in a shopping mall escalator,", "title": "AP News - Chinese woman dies after trapped in escalator, but saves son", "url": "http://townhall.com/news/world/2015/07/27/chinese-woman-dies-after-trapped-in-escalator-but-saves-son-n2030716", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/_townhall/resources/images/thog.png", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "BEIJING (AP) \u2014 A Chinese woman died after being trapped in a shopping mall escalator,", "title": "AP News - Chinese woman dies after trapped in escalator, but saves son", "url": "http://townhall.com/news/world/2015/07/27/chinese-woman-dies-after-trapped-in-escalator-but-saves-son-n2030716", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/_townhall/resources/images/thog.png", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Chinese woman dies after trapped in escalator, but saves son, AP News, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdcaee\"", "article_summary": "BEIJING (AP) \u2014 A Chinese woman died after being trapped in a shopping mall escalator, but not before pushing her 2-year-old son to safety.\nThe footage shows that Xiang managed to push her son into the arms of shop attendants near the top of the escalator.\nThe attendants tried to pull her to safety, but Xiang fell into the mechanism and was killed.\nThe state-run People's Daily's online edition and other media outlets said her body was recovered four hours later, after crews disassembled the escalator.\nSunday's horrific accident in the central city of Jingzhou was caught on surveillance camera footage that circulated heavily on the Internet in China."}
