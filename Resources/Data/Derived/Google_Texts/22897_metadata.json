At least, that\u2019s the narrative circulating in Washington when it comes to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP)\u2014formerly known as Food Stamps. A new report from the President\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers at the White House incorrectly argues as much, and suggests that benefits should be increased. But before acting on this recommendation, Congress might want to take a closer look at the data that show that SNAP eliminates hunger for the overwhelming majority of American children, and leaves most recipient households with adequate food. Congress should reform SNAP, but a costly benefit increase is not the right answer.\n\nAccording to a US Department of Agriculture survey on food security, only 1.1 percent of American households with children had a child who experienced hunger in 2014. Yet, the CEA report mistakenly claims that \u201cthe current level of [SNAP] benefits often cannot sustain families through the end of the month\u2014causing children to go hungry and endangering their health, educational performance, and life chances.\u201d Little evidence suggests that low SNAP benefits contribute to child hunger. In fact, SNAP is a major reason child hunger is not a larger problem.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe CEA\u2019s claim that SNAP cannot sustain families through the end of the month also overstates the evidence. It is true that food purchases for SNAP households have been found to decline over the course of the month. But researchers Justine Hastings and Ebonya Washington suggest in their 2010 American Economic Journal article that this is due to \u201cshort-term impatience.\u201d In other words, households respond to a large influx of cash-equivalent at the beginning of the month by spending it up-front. The authors recommend solving this problem by giving out SNAP benefits more frequently.\n\nA study by Jessica Todd published in 2014 in Applied Economic Perspectives and Policy found that a temporary increase in SNAP benefits resulting from the 2009 stimulus package increased SNAP spending later in the month. It\u2019s been suggested that this means that SNAP benefit levels were too low prior to the increase. It\u2019s possible. But it is also possible that households responded to an increase in benefits by spending more, which still doesn\u2019t tell us much about the adequacy of SNAP benefits.\n\nThe CEA report\u2019s statement that \u201ca majority of SNAP households still reported experiencing low or very low food security in 2014\u201d also misrepresents SNAP. Low food security (meaning an adequate, nutritious diet is not provided) could have easily occurred before the household started receiving SNAP benefits. Examining food security data while households were participating in the program, reveals that 66.5 percent were in fact food secure.\n\nAnother way to assess SNAP adequacy is to compare benefit levels to the cost of food in the thrifty food plan (USDA\u2019s assessment of an adequate diet that is used to set SNAP benefit levels). A recent study found \u201cthat for roughly 30 percent of households, the average cost of the [thrifty food plan] exceeds the maximum SNAP benefit.\u201d This means that 70 percent of SNAP households receive sufficient benefits to provide a diet determined adequate by USDA, which provides further evidence that SNAP is sufficient for most households.\n\nAll of this is to suggest that costly across-the-board increases in SNAP benefit levels are not needed. According to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), the SNAP increase in the 2009 stimulus cost approximately $8.4 billion per year (accounting for about one-fifth of the growth in SNAP expenditures from 2009 to 2011). A 3 percent benefit increase, per the CBO, would cost an additional $2.3 billion per year.\n\nA less costly option may be to provide different benefit levels based on local food costs, as has been suggested in a 2013 Institute of Medicine report. Allowing for larger housing cost deductions when calculating SNAP amounts should also be considered. This would increase SNAP amounts for those living in high housing costs areas, such as New York City, Boston, and Washington, D.C. Both would better target those most at risk of being \u2018food insecure,\u2019 without raising benefit levels for many of those who do not need it.\n\nPilot programs to test these theories are also worth considering, as was recommended in a new report from the National Commission on Hunger. And more research is definitely needed on the relationship between SNAP and hunger, especially among children. Adding a question to the USDA\u2019s food security survey to better assess whether households were receiving SNAP at the time of the reported incidence of hunger would be a good first step.\n\nSNAP has been described as \u201cone of the most effective antipoverty programs in the safety net.\u201d If this is to remain true, we need an open and transparent dialogue about what the data really show. Large-scale policy changes based on false impressions are not the answer.\n\nRachidi is a research fellow in poverty studies at the American Enterprise Institute.
