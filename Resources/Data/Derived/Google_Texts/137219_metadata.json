This perk is expected to total $143 billion in 2014, making it the largest federal tax exclusion. Employees also often get a break.\n\nGruber, an MIT economist, has long been against it, and many economists agree.\n\nThe tax break benefits the wealthy more because they are in a higher tax bracket. And it encourages companies to offer and employees to buy more generous health plans.\n\n\"It bids up the cost of health care,\" said Roberton Williams, senior fellow at the Tax Policy Center.\n\nRelated: Americans don't like Obamacare, even if enrollees do\n\nWhile tax reformers have tried to eliminate this break for years, they've met with stiff opposition from companies and labor unions.\n\nEnter Obamacare's Cadillac tax. Companies will have to pay a 40% tax on the value of policies above a certain cap, which in 2018, is $10,200 for an individual and $27,500 for a family.\n\nAt first, that will mostly curb benefits for wealthy executives and union workers that negotiated generous plans. Soon it will capture more people, since the caps will rise each year with inflation.\n\nAnd though companies have to pay the tax, it could have an impact on workers' wages, some fear.\n\nIt's Gruber's comments on how the Obama administration got the Cadillac tax through Congress that's stirred up so much controversy.\n\n\"The only way we could get rid of it [the tax break] was first by mislabeling it [the Cadillac tax], calling it a tax on insurance plans rather than a tax on people when we all know it's a tax on people who hold those insurance plans,\" Gruber said at a public policy research forum in 2011.\n\nGruber estimates than the Cadillac tax will effectively get rid of company health insurance in 20 years, though other experts aren't that sure. But it will certainly force many changes to company plans, some of which are already under way. Employers will shift more of the costs onto employees -- in the form of higher deductibles and co-pays -- in order to keep premiums below the cap.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "obamacare, gruber, tax, cadillac tax, jonathan gruber, aca, affordable care act, esi, employer-sponsored insurance, employer-sponsored health insurance, obama, jonathan gruber, economist, economy, cnnmoney", "title": "The Obamacare tax at center of Gruber firestorm", "og": {"url": "http://money.cnn.com/2014/11/19/news/economy/obamacare-gruber-tax/index.html", "site_name": "CNNMoney", "type": "article", "description": "The controversy sparked by economist Jonathan Gruber centers on the Cadillac tax on employer-sponsored health insurance, instituted by Obamacare.", "title": "The Obamacare tax at center of Gruber firestorm"}, "section": "news", "author": "Tami Luhby", "vr": {"category": "economy", "type": "Article"}, "DC.date.issued": "2014-11-19T09:18:48", "keywords": "obamacare, gruber, tax, cadillac tax, jonathan gruber, aca, affordable care act, esi, employer-sponsored insurance, employer-sponsored health insurance, obama, jonathan gruber, economist, economy, cnnmoney", "fb": {"app_id": 521848191196480}, "subsection": "economy", "date": "2014-11-19 09:18:48", "twitter": {"url": "http://money.cnn.com/2014/11/19/news/economy/obamacare-gruber-tax/index.html", "description": "The controversy sparked by economist Jonathan Gruber centers on the Cadillac tax on employer-sponsored health insurance, instituted by Obamacare.", "site": "@CNNMoney", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "The Obamacare tax at center of Gruber firestorm"}, "viewport": "width=1140", "description": "The controversy sparked by economist Jonathan Gruber centers on the Cadillac tax on employer-sponsored health insurance, instituted by Obamacare."}, "_id": "\"57477afa6914bd0286fe63d9\"", "article_summary": "Whether or not American voters are \"stupid,\" it's a good bet most are not familiar with the Obamacare tax that's whipped up a firestorm in recent days.\nThe tax break benefits the wealthy more because they are in a higher tax bracket.\nGruber estimates than the Cadillac tax will effectively get rid of company health insurance in 20 years, though other experts aren't that sure.\nIt's Gruber's comments on how the Obama administration got the Cadillac tax through Congress that's stirred up so much controversy.\n\"The only way we could get rid of it [the tax break] was first by mislabeling it [the Cadillac tax], calling it a tax on insurance plans rather than a tax on people when we all know it's a tax on people who hold those insurance plans,\" Gruber said at a public policy research forum in 2011."}
