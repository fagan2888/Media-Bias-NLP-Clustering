While that number makes the case that the program is achieving one of its top stated goals, 41 million Americans remain without insurance. As the Obama administration nears the second round of open enrollment for the much-touted exchange market, strikingly few people are expected to sign up for insurance starting Saturday.\n\nDespite promising numbers from the first and second quarter of 2014, the administration has projected only 9.1 million Americans will have signed up for the ACA\u2019s exchanges by the end of 2015. That\u2019s a paltry change from the 7.1 million already taking part and well below the 13 million projected by the Congressional Budget Office. Many have called the figure a \u201clowball\u201d from the White House, while others have pounced on the number as proof that President Barack Obama\u2019s health care law is simply not working. \u201cDespite the administration\u2019s habit of moving the goalposts, the fact is Obamacare is simply not delivering the results Americans were originally promised,\u201d said Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif.\n\nThis year\u2019s open-enrollment period begins at a later and less optimum time than last year\u2019s did \u2013 it falls in the middle of the Thanksgiving and Christmas holidays \u2013 and runs for only three months, compared with six in 2013. But given the number of people who say they want health insurance and the subsidies, penalty exemptions and discounted policies now available, why aren\u2019t more people signing up for Obamacare?\n\nPhoto: Reuters/Jonathan Ernst\n\nThe disconnect may be because many uninsured Americans simply don't feel compelled to take action. Joseph Antos, a health policy expert at the American Enterprise Institute, said that when the ACA\u2019s website debuted, many people fought through pervasive malfunctions and various system inefficiencies because they were excited to get insurance. But now, most of those people are insured and those who are left are harder to convince.\n\n\u201cWhen it was shiny and new, people paid attention,\u201d Antos told International Business Times. \u201cAt this point there has been so much publicity about this and I\u2019m sure that people\u2019s minds start to shut off, [thinking] \u2018Why are you telling me this again?\u2019 It\u2019s not that they\u2019ve signed up, but they\u2019re tired of hearing about it. You know, when your mother tells you the 50th time to clean your room, you stop listening.\u201d\n\nContinue Reading Below\n\nThose who still have not applied for Obamacare also haven\u2019t seen the ramifications of not signing up for insurance, Antos said. \u201cThe other part of this that isn\u2019t going to work out is the mandate that if you\u2019re not signed up you\u2019re penalized \u2026 but most people don\u2019t know anyone that\u2019s been penalized, because no one\u2019s been penalized yet,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is the kind of thing that takes so long to put in that it\u2019s not going to make it to the conversations in the neighborhood. If the penalty is actually imposed on people then the idea that there\u2019s a negative if you don\u2019t sign up \u2026 is real. But right now it\u2019s just a theory.\u201d\n\nThe Obama administration waived the penalty for the first year because of problems with the HealthCare.Gov website, and Antos said he expects the administration to waive it again. The penalty would be $95 or 1 percent of an individual\u2019s income above the tax filing threshold, whichever is higher, for 2014. It increases to $325 per person or 2 percent of income above tax filing threshold next year.\n\nAdditionally, there\u2019s the possible backlash to increased premiums, which are generally expected, and the bad memories of trying to sign up through the HealthCare.Gov website that could cause people who were insured to change their minds. New enrollment estimates from the Department of Health and Human Services assume that about 6 million people, or 83 percent of the people who got 2014 coverage, will renew their plan for 2015.\n\nBut the biggest problem may simply be that most people don\u2019t know what\u2019s happening. A recent poll from the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation discovered that nine out of 10 uninsured Americans are unaware that open enrollment starts on Saturday.\n\n\u201cI think that is an unfortunate continuation of a trend that\u2019s been going on for quite a while now. Our data shows that people really aren\u2019t familiar with what\u2019s in the ACA,\u201d Karen Pollitz, senior fellow at the Kaiser Family Foundation, told IBTimes.\n\nAdditionally, two-thirds of uninsured Americans said that they knew either nothing or just a little about the marketplaces, and 53 percent do not know that the health reform law provides financial assistance to low- and moderate-income Americans. \u201cThis is still new,\u201d said Pollitz. \u201cEven if they heard about open enrollment last year, they may not realize that it comes around every year.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://s2.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/themes/us_ibtimes/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "obamacare enrollment, low obamacare enrollment, why is nobody signing up for obamacare, obamcare enrollment 2015, aca enrollment 2015, aca open enrollment 2015, aca open enrolment 2015, aca open enrollment 2014, aca open enrolment 2014, obamacare numbers", "og": {"site_name": "International Business Times", "description": "A recent poll discovered that 9 out of 10 uninsured Americans are not aware that open enrollment starts on Saturday.", "title": "Why Are So Few People Signing Up For Obamacare?
