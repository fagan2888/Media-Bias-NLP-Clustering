It spread into neighboring Syria to join the Sunni movement to oust President Bashar Assad, whose Alawite sect is an offshoot of Shiism. In recent months, it has ramped up its march of terror across western and northern Iraq, defeating government forces and overtaking several cities in Sunni-dominated regions.", "article_metadata": {"description": "US, Sunni states meet on Mideast insurgent crisis", "title": "US, Sunni states meet on Mideast insurgent crisis", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "US, Sunni states meet on Mideast insurgent crisis", "title": "US, Sunni states meet on Mideast insurgent crisis", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/06/26/us_sunni_states_meet_on_mideast_insurgent_crisis/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/06/france-mideast-kerry.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "US, Sunni states meet on Mideast insurgent crisis", "title": "US, Sunni states meet on Mideast insurgent crisis", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/06/france-mideast-kerry.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Lara Jakes", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Topics: From the Wires, NewsPARIS (AP) \u2014 The United States met Thursday with its top Sunni state allies in the Mideast to consider how to confront the region\u2019s growing turmoil that has been spawned by a Sunni Muslim insurgency group.\nKerry also met earlier Thursday with the Sunni former prime minister of Lebanon.\nSaudi Foreign Minister Saud al-Faisal called the discussions \u201cof immense importance for our countries.\u201d\u201cI think with the cooperation between these countries we can affect, hopefully, the situation in a better way,\u201d al-Faisal said.\nIt spread into neighboring Syria to join the Sunni movement to oust President Bashar Assad, whose Alawite sect is an offshoot of Shiism.\nU.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said the threat posed by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant reaches beyond the two countries \u2014 Iraq and Syria \u2014 where it is currently based."}
