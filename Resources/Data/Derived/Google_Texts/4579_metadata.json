Days away from her dream being fulfilled, it all fell apart.\n\nImagine living 28 years\u2014your whole life\u2014trapped inside the wrong body. Forced, through chemical happenstance, to go through your days within a fleshy conveyance that doesn\u2019t match the spirit driving it. Now imagine that one day hope appeared, an unexpected opportunity to free yourself, to finally be yourself. Right there, within your grasp, leading you by the nose for a full year of preparation\u2014only to be yanked away at the very last possible second because someone, somewhere, pushed the wrong button.\n\nThis is exactly what Thea Shaheen claims happened to her.\n\nBorn, and equipped, as Theodore Shaheen, she says she knew her whole life that she wasn\u2019t who she anatomically presented to be. Thus it was no surprise when she says her doctors officially diagnosed her with gender dysphoria, the medical terminology for identifying as one sex while possessing the body of another, which can lead to psychological and even physical duress. It\u2019s a diagnosis that has been making headlines of late, as New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo advised insurance providers in his state that they would have to begin covering gender-reassignment surgery judged medically necessary by a patient with dysphoria. That makes New York the ninth state to require such coverage.\n\nUnfortunately, Shaheen\u2014a network support engineer in Providence, Rhode Island\u2014doesn\u2019t live in one of them.\n\nIt was just a year ago, in 2013, that she says she discovered the insurance her job provided had a clause that could help her make the changes she needed to become wholly herself.\n\n\u201cI saw in our employee literature one of our health benefits is transgender services, of which one is gender-reassignment surgery,\u201d she explained from a hotel in San Francisco. \u201cSo I contacted the insurance company. It took me a little bit of time to find out what information I needed and who I needed to talk to, but I finally got ahold of somebody who was aware of our policy and who said, \u2018Yes, that\u2019s covered. That\u2019s part of your policy.\u2019\u201d\n\nExcited, Shaheen wasted no time and began interviewing surgeons, deciding upon Dr. Curtis Crane in Greenbrae, California.\n\n\u201cI had a consultation in January of last year,\u201d she explains. \u201cAnd when I decided that I liked that surgeon, they began working with my insurance company. They, too, received information that it was covered, and they received a pre-authorization.\u201d\n\nShaheen says she then provided Crane with the necessary documentation from her primary care physician at Boston\u2019s LGBT-centric Fenway Institute, including statements from her therapist and a psychologist. Everything was moving ahead smoothly, and continued to for the rest of the year.\n\n\u201cAs far as we were aware, and as far as the surgeon was aware, the surgery was a go,\u201d Shaheen sighs.\n\nBut then, just three days before boarding the flight on Dec. 13 of this year that would take her to the rest of her life, things started to get weird.\n\nOn Wednesday, Dec. 10, Shaheen was driving to Boston when she says an administrator from Crane\u2019s office called to alert her to an issue with the insurance company, which was suddenly reversing course and declining coverage for the operation.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t really have any coherent thoughts at that time, it was pretty shocking,\u201d she admits, her voice wavering slightly. \u201cI thought, \u2018This has to be, they said it.\u2019 And even the surgeon was like, \u2018Yes, this has been said, we have all the evidence that this should happen.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe next morning, Shaheen says she began frantically working with the insurance company, Blue Cross Blue Shield of Rhode Island, and her employer, hoping against hope that this was just some mixup. Ultimately, Shaheen noted wryly, it was. Just not in her favor.\n\n\u201cLiterally all we got, as far as I\u2019m aware, is that they simply made a mistake when they said I had [coverage], and I didn\u2019t. We worked with one of their supervisors, who talked to their management directly to get a final decision. Which came on Friday. And they said \u2018You know, this isn\u2019t fair, but what should we do?\u2019\u201d\n\nHer ticket to California couldn\u2019t be refunded. Neither could her three-week, multi-thousand dollar stay, which was supposed to be a recovery period. So she boarded the plane, unsure as to what to do next.\n\nIn order to pay for the surgery out-of-pocket, Shaheen says it would cost her $30,000\u2014and much, much more if there were any complications. But for her, the peace of mind that comes with actually inhabiting the correct body isn\u2019t something you can put a price tag on.\n\nJames Joiner\n\n\u201cThe thing that\u2019s been most troublesome about it to me is not that it\u2019s not happening right now,\u201d she vented. \u201cBut I\u2019ve spent the past year anticipating this, I knew it was coming. I was thinking, \u2018Oh this is the last year I\u2019ll have to deal with this,\u2019 or \u2018This is the last time this is gonna happen and next year will be better.\u2019 And now that\u2019s not true. Now I have to possibly wait more than another year, and it\u2019s not fair.\u201d\n\nGet The Beast In Your Inbox!

While we do not comment on individual member cases, we make every effort to provide accurate and timely information to all of our members.\u201d\n\nCrane\u2019s office did not respond to multiple attempts to contact them.\n\nShaheen, for her part, doesn\u2019t want to be made a martyr in this story, but instead hopes that it shines a broader light on the issues faced by transgender Americans.\n\n\u201cI came so close, and if this was a procedure that wasn\u2019t what it is, would the same outcome have happened?\u201d she asks, frustration palpable in her voice. But she also knows that, ultimately, it\u2019s just her against a seemingly heartless health-care machine. \u201cSo even though they made a mistake, there was nothing that they did illegally. They were in the legal right to do what they did. They were correct in the end, and I can\u2019t do anything about that.\u201d\n\nThere may be hope again on the horizon.\n\nOutside of the now nine states that mandate insurance coverage, this past fall the Affordable Care Act also started to cover gender-reassignment surgery, and last spring Medicare lifted its ban as well.\n\nAnd Thea? Well, she\u2019s not giving up.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to put myself back together, recompose myself. Return back to Rhode Island for work, and make a plan for how I\u2019m going to get the coverage I need, and see what options I have.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"twitter": {"site": "@thedailybeast", "card": "summary", "creator": "jjamesjoiner"}, "keywords": "health insurance, Tech &amp; Health, Transgender", "publicationDate": 201412291055, "wrap": "/content/dailybeast/tech-and-health", "news_keywords": "health insurance, Tech Health, Transgender", "pageNum": 1, "title": "The Insurance Company Promised a Gender Reassignment.
