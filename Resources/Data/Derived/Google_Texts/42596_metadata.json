A nurse with 30 years\u2019 experience, she remembers working for a managed care company in the \u201990s doing precertifications and checking hospital stays.\n\n\u201cI worked with algorithms that said things like, \u2018Patient A is going to have this surgery and get four days in the hospital,\u2019\u201d she recalls. \u201cAnd if the person didn\u2019t go home in four days, I had to figure out why. It was very, very stressful.\u201d Today Siegel has a job she likes much better. And there\u2019s every chance she\u2019s saving more health care dollars now than she did back in the bad old days.\n\n\u201cTwo years ago, when I started, having a care coordinator in the office was a very new concept,\u201d says Sandra Siegel, RN, of Hunterdon Healthcare Partners. \u201cWell, have things changed in two years!\u201d\n\nSiegel is a population care coordinator employed by Hunterdon Healthcare Partners (HHP), a for-profit arm of Hunterdon Medical Center in Flemington, N.J., that manages its integrated delivery system and forms an accountable care organization (ACO) under the Affordable Care Act (ACA).\n\nThough HHP cuts her paycheck, Siegel is closely linked to two other entities: She spends her days \u201cembedded\u201d in a Hillsborough, N.J.-based primary care practice called Your Doctors Care, and she\u2019s part of an initiative sponsored by Horizon Blue Cross Blue Shield of New Jersey, the Garden State\u2019s largest health insurer with 3.7 million members.\n\nHorizon BCBS runs the state\u2019s largest patient-centered medical home (PCMH) program, of which roughly 200 population care coordinators statewide are a part. At Your Doctors Care, she works with a patient panel mainly of Horizon members. But physicians and patients alike know one thing about Siegel: She\u2019s not the enemy.\n\n\u201cMy impact now is much greater than it was in my old job because I get to talk to patients,\u201d she says. \u201cI get to find out what barriers they face \u2014 barriers to being compliant with medications, for example \u2014 and determine what we can do to help them take better care of themselves. Because if you don\u2019t drill down and find out what\u2019s really going on, you\u2019re not going to make a difference.\u201d\n\nSiegel and her fellow coordinators in the Horizon program play a vital role in the effort the insurer is making, in common with many of its fellows across the country, to deliver timelier, more effective, less wasteful care by turning the primary care practice into a PCMH \u2014 \u201cone point of contact for all your health care needs,\u201d as a Horizon BCBS brochure tells its members.\n\nReinventing primary care\n\nHorizon BCBS\u2019s goal in launching its PCMH program, says Carl Rathjen, manager of network strategy and program development, was to promote a culture of change in the primary care practice. Change has certainly been in the air nationally, with the ACA and every expert calling for a new emphasis on prevention. And if that weren\u2019t enough, the need for a change in primary care was also suggested by the field\u2019s scary demographics, with dwindling numbers of medical school grads choosing primary care specialties and pros in the field burning out faster than their specialist colleagues.\n\n\u201cHorizon wants to promote a culture of change in primary care practices, says Carl Rathjen, the health plan\u2019s manager of network strategy and program development. That was one of the insurer\u2019s goals in launching its patient-centered medical home program.\n\nIn the PCMH model, as a 2012 Health Affairs article by Rathjen and two Horizon colleagues put it, \u201cPrimary care becomes the focal point for the delivery system because of its ability to provide patient-centered, comprehensive coordinated health care to patient populations \u2014 care that goes beyond the mere provision of basic services.\u201d To bring costs down and quality up, the theory goes, doctors\u2019 offices on a vast scale must stop simply waiting for patients to come in the door and start proactively managing their health.\n\nThat\u2019s what Siegel tries to do, working with other staffers at Your Doctors Care. \u201cI never do the same thing two days in a row,\u201d she reports with satisfaction. But the thrust of what she does each day is to reach out to high-risk patients before they have an expensive medical crisis so they can get the care they need to head that crisis off. \u201cA lot of it involves keeping people out of the hospital,\u201d says Siegel. \u201cThat is, keeping people healthy so they don\u2019t need to go to the hospital.\u201d\n\nPatients are stratified according to risk based on claim reports provided to practices monthly by Horizon, and people rated at the highest risk levels become the subject of outreach. Explains Siegel: \u201cWe can run a report on our hypertensive patients, our diabetic patients, or our patients with congestive heart failure and ask, \u2018Are they coming in for their scheduled appointments? Are they getting the care they need?\u2019 For example, we might say, \u2018How about Mary Smith? She\u2019s multimorbid, Level 5, yet she hasn\u2019t been in for six months. Why not?\u2019 We don\u2019t just wait until she gets sick. Mary gets a call.\u201d\n\nRathjen says that \u201cThe core concept of this model is to strengthen the relationship between our members and their physicians through payer-provider collaboration.\u201d Indeed, one mark of this collaborative approach is that risk scores aren\u2019t just handed down to practices like edicts from on high; the doctor, who knows his or her patients, makes the final decisions.\n\nMary Aikins, RN, of Horizon, says, \u201cWe hear frequently about the difference population care coordinators make.\u201d Both patients and doctors value the PCMH effort, she adds.\n\nExplains Mary Aikins, RN, Horizon\u2019s manager of care management operations: \u201cThe doctor takes the risk scores we provide for patients based on claims data and asks, \u2018Do I as the physician agree that they\u2019re high-risk?\u2019 So claims information isn\u2019t the be-all and end-all. The doctor may say, \u2018I know Joe Jones had a lot of claims last year, but that was because of a back injury that has been resolved; he\u2019s now healthy. But 55-year-old Al Clark, who doesn\u2019t exercise and has a tough family heart-disease history \u2014 I call him high-risk even though he doesn\u2019t yet show up in your claims data.\u2019 So it may be Clark who gets contacted.\u201d\n\nPCMH designation\n\nSpecifically, it\u2019s a division within Horizon called Horizon Healthcare Innovations (HHI) that runs the insurer\u2019s four-year-old PCMH initiative. To be part of the program, Horizon encourages practices to work toward designation as a PCMH from an accrediting body such as the National Committee for Quality Assurance, URAC, or the Joint Commission.\n\nThat means, of course, that they agree to use electronic medical records and provide the data necessary to evaluate care. They also must have evening and weekend hours \u2014 and round-the-clock access to physician advice \u2014 to minimize emergency room visits.\n\nWhen a practice meets these responsibilities and is allowed to participate, Horizon provides initial and ongoing training for the coordinators. Siegel remembers taking a rigorous 12-week graduate course in population care coordination given at Duke University School of Nursing in Durham, N.C., in collaboration with Rutgers University School of Nursing in Newark.\n\nHorizon has since designed its own two-day, in-state learning collaborative to offer the program more frequently to incoming population care coordinators. These sessions include training on Horizon-developed tools to support population management.\n\nHorizon also pays practices a monthly care coordination fee to subsidize the coordinators\u2019 paychecks. That fee is reduced after the first two years, but by then the successful practice is earning more by meeting tough benchmarks for quality, utilization, and patient experience.\n\nNew role for nurses\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s one of the distinctive features of our program that we require these population care coordinators to be registered nurses,\u201d says Aikins, who has 17 years\u2019 experience running a case management company and was involved in planning the coordinator role for Horizon from the beginning.\n\nIndeed, agrees Steven Peskin, MD, HHI\u2019s senior medical director, this unusual use of nurses is a potential model for other health plans. \u201cNurses have been working in similar roles for hospitals and large integrated health systems for years,\u201d he says. \u201cBut we think it\u2019s novel that a payer has implemented this RN function that operates within primary care practices.\u201d (Full disclosure: Peskin is a former executive vice president and chief medical officer at MediMedia USA., which publishes Managed Care.)\n\n\u201cWe think it\u2019s novel that a payer has implemented this RN function that operates within primary care practices,\u201d says Steven Peskin, MD, the senior medical director at Horizon Healthcare Innovations.\n\n\u201cThis is a very distinct role from what nurses traditionally have done within the managed care industry,\u201d agrees Rathjen. \u201cAs care coordinators, these nurses actively engage the patients to keep them healthy, not just speak to them when they are sick.\u201d\n\nNurses have both the clinical authority and the people skills to build the necessary trust with patients, he says. \u201cWe wanted people with significant clinical expertise who could communicate with patients so that patients would act on what they recommend.\u201d\n\nSays Aikins: \u201cIn many situations, patients prefer to be engaged with, as opposed to being \u2018managed\u2019 or \u2018directed\u2019 in the traditional insurance-company case-management or utilization management functions \u2014 although we have those too.\u201d\n\nIt started with eight\n\nHorizon\u2019s PCMH program began in 2009 with an initial focus only on patients with diabetes. Some 33 practices qualified to participate. Costs were reduced, but as the Health Affairs article explained, \u201cthe reduction was not enough to cover all of the up-front costs incurred by Horizon.\u201d In discussions with the New Jersey Academy of Family Physicians and participating doctors, the insurer decided to put more chips on the table. It designated just eight practices as participating PCMHs and assigned each a population care coordinator to work not only on diabetic patients, but on all patients. At that point, the coordinators were direct Horizon employees.\n\n\u201cI started with eight nurses,\u201d Aikins recalls. \u201cBack then we didn\u2019t have a lot of the reports we have today, and we had to develop a training program. We\u2019ve moved away from Horizon being the employer; now we provide a subsidy and the population care coordinators are employed by the practices.\u201d In cases like Siegel\u2019s, they are employed by an integrated delivery system.\n\nWith initial results promising, the program was \u201cscaled up\u201d to where it now involves about 200 practices around the state. And as Peskin points out, Horizon \u201ccontinues to support the participating practices with training and mentoring.\u201d\n\nThe culture change didn\u2019t happen overnight, and it wasn\u2019t all the population care coordinators\u2019 doing. Every member of the PCMH practices learned to do his or her part to facilitate proactive care. And everyone faced a learning curve \u2014 including doctors. \u201cTwo years ago, when I started, having a care coordinator in the office was a very new concept,\u201d says Siegel. \u201cDoctors and office staff weren\u2019t sure what to do with us. Well, have things changed in two years!\u201d\n\nToday, she says, \u201cour front-office staff has been educated. They do a fabulous job of helping to identify high-risk patients when they call or come in and helping us triage and figure out what\u2019s going on.\u201d\n\nThe idea, as Aikins explains it, is to have every member of the practice staff working to the top of his or her license.\n\n\u201cWe work as a team,\u201d says Siegel. \u201cThe coordinators don\u2019t direct care or come up with treatment plans, but the doctor may say, \u2018Why don\u2019t you sit down and do some diabetes education with this patient?\u2019 Or it may be hypertension or weight-loss counseling.\u201d\n\nData from 2013, released in July, suggest that the Horizon PCMH program is making a difference. (See \u201cBut Does It Work? The Horizon PCMH Record\u201d below.) And Siegel offers anecdotal evidence that her workdays now are not only more satisfying, but also more effective than were her struggles to limit hospital stays back in the \u201990s. She recalls with satisfaction that when one patient was having a crisis that was beyond what her primary care practice could deal with, she got on the phone and invoked her relationship with Hunterdon Medical Center. Such is Siegel\u2019s concern for the patient privacy requirements of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) that she declines to identify even the specialist\u2019s clinical area, but she got the person in to see the appropriate specialist within three hours.\n\nBut does it work? The Horizon PCMH record To date, there is no clear evidence that the [patient-centered] medical home improves the quality of care or reduces the total cost of care,\u201d wrote Horizon Blue Cross Blue Shield staffers Carl Rathjen, Urvashi B. Patel, and Elizabeth Rubin in Health Affairs in 2012. But today \u2014 with a hefty assist from \u201cpopulation care coordinators\u201d based in primary care practices who combine RN credentials with special population-care training \u2014 they and their colleagues are working hard to change that. And the favorable evidence is starting to come in. As the company reported in July, a study of 2013 claims data for more than 200,000 members compared PCMH patients with a similar set of patients in traditional practices. The PCMH patients showed a 14% higher rate of improved diabetes control, a 12% higher rate of effective cholesterol management, an 8% higher rate of breast cancer screening, and a 6% higher rate of colorectal cancer screenings. The contrast was less sharp when it came to reducing costs, but here too the PCMH practices did better. The rate of hospital admissions for the latter group was 2% lower, while the number of emergency room visits, the cost of care for diabetic patients, and the total cost of care were all 4% lower for the PCMH group. Said Horizon: \u201cMembers under the care of a patient-centered practice were also able to avoid more than 1,200 emergency room visits and 260 hospital admissions, which represent a savings of approximately $4.5 million.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, Aikins says another population care coordinator was making a routine phone call to follow up on a patient who hadn\u2019t had her mammogram or other recommended screenings. \u201cThe coordinator introduced herself, said she was calling from Dr. So-and-so\u2019s office and explained her role,\u201d she says, \u201cand the patient mentioned that her brother had recently passed away, and that she hadn\u2019t been feeling well and had been meaning to make an appointment with the doctor. It turned out she had multiple blocked arteries, and two days later she had three stents put in. The coordinator\u2019s routine call very likely saved her life.\u201d\n\nThis new professional\u2019s role may not by itself be a panacea, but Horizon\u2019s position is that it is part of the answer to transforming primary care, which in turn can be the key to making health care leaner, more proactive, and more effective.\n\n\u201cWe hear frequently about the difference population care coordinators make,\u201d says Aikins. \u201cWe hear it from practices and we hear it from patients.\u201d\n\n8 qualities a coordinator needs Sandra Siegel, RN, a population care coordinator in the patient-centered medical home program of New Jersey\u2019s Horizon Blue Cross Blue Shield, is clearly a people person, but she also has an affinity for quantitative thinking. \u201cI like data,\u201d she declares. Because coordinators like her may have a role to play in improving health care nationally while containing costs, Managed Care asked Siegel what qualities are required for success in a job like the one she\u2019s now held for two years. She says a population care coordinator must: Have a strong, well-rounded nursing background and general health care knowledge.\n\nBe a kind, caring person.\n\nBe a good listener, attuned to what patients are telling her or him (even sometimes \u201cin between\u201d the words they\u2019re explicitly saying).\n\nUnderstand data and how to interpret it.\n\nBe familiar with electronic medical records.\n\nBe comfortable speaking in medical terms with providers and in lay language with patients, and switching rapidly between the two.\n\nKnow the community, its transportation system, its services for the disabled, its nursing homes, its clinics, its hospitals, and their departments such as emergency rooms, radiology facilities, etc.\n\nBe intuitive, creative, and able to \u201cthink out of the box.\u201d\n\nThe author was editor of Managed Care from 1995 through 1997.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Trying to save money in health care isn\u2019t new to Sandra Siegel, RN.

But does it work? The Horizon PCMH record To date, there is no clear evidence that the [patient-centered] medical home improves the quality of care or reduces the total cost of care,\u201d wrote Horizon Blue Cross Blue Shield staffers Carl Rathjen, Urvashi B. Patel, and Elizabeth Rubin in Health Affairs in 2012. But today \u2014 with a hefty assist from \u201cpopulation care coordinators\u201d based in primary care practices who combine RN credentials with special population-care training \u2014 they and their colleagues are working hard to change that. And the favorable evidence is starting to come in. As the company reported in July, a study of 2013 claims data for more than 200,000 members compared PCMH patients with a similar set of patients in traditional practices. The PCMH patients showed a 14% higher rate of improved diabetes control, a 12% higher rate of effective cholesterol management, an 8% higher rate of breast cancer screening, and a 6% higher rate of colorectal cancer screenings. The contrast was less sharp when it came to reducing costs, but here too the PCMH practices did better. The rate of hospital admissions for the latter group was 2% lower, while the number of emergency room visits, the cost of care for diabetic patients, and the total cost of care were all 4% lower for the PCMH group. Said Horizon: \u201cMembers under the care of a patient-centered practice were also able to avoid more than 1,200 emergency room visits and 260 hospital admissions, which represent a savings of approximately $4.5 million.\u201d     Similarly, Aikins says another population care coordinator was making a routine phone call to follow up on a patient who hadn\u2019t had her mammogram or other recommended screenings. \u201cThe coordinator introduced herself, said she was calling from Dr. So-and-so\u2019s office and explained her role,\u201d she says, \u201cand the patient mentioned that her brother had recently passed away, and that she hadn\u2019t been feeling well and had been meaning to make an appointment with the doctor. It turned out she had multiple blocked arteries, and two days later she had three stents put in. The coordinator\u2019s routine call very likely saved her life.\u201d This new professional\u2019s role may not by itself be a panacea, but Horizon\u2019s position is that it is part of the answer to transforming primary care, which in turn can be the key to making health care leaner, more proactive, and more effective. \u201cWe hear frequently about the difference population care coordinators make,\u201d says Aikins. \u201cWe hear it from practices and we hear it from patients.\u201d  8 qualities a coordinator needs Sandra Siegel, RN, a population care coordinator in the patient-centered medical home program of New Jersey\u2019s Horizon Blue Cross Blue Shield, is clearly a people person, but she also has an affinity for quantitative thinking. \u201cI like data,\u201d she declares. Because coordinators like her may have a role to play in improving health care nationally while containing costs, Managed Care asked Siegel what qualities are required for success in a job like the one she\u2019s now held for two years. She says a population care coordinator must:   Have a strong, well-rounded nursing background and general health care knowledge.  Be a kind, caring person.  Be a good listener, attuned to what patients are telling her or him (even sometimes \u201cin between\u201d the words they\u2019re explicitly saying).  Understand data and how to interpret it.  Be familiar with electronic medical records.  Be comfortable speaking in medical terms with providers and in lay language with patients, and switching rapidly between the two.  Know the community, its transportation system, its services for the disabled, its nursing homes, its clinics, its hospitals, and their departments such as emergency rooms, radiology facilities, etc.  Be intuitive, creative, and able to \u201cthink out of the box.\u201d   The author was editor of Managed Care from 1995 through 1997.", "description": "Horizon Blue Cross Blue Shield of New Jersey wants to give its patient-centered medical home model extra oomph.

A nurse with 30 years\u2019 experience, she remembers working for a managed care company in the \u201990s doing precertifications and checking hospital stays. \u201cI worked with algorithms that said things like, \u2018Patient A is going to have this surgery and get four days in the hospital,\u2019\u201d she recalls. \u201cAnd if the person didn\u2019t go home in four days, I had to figure out why. It was very, very stressful.\u201d Today Siegel has a job she likes much better. And there\u2019s every chance she\u2019s saving more health care dollars now than she did back in the bad old days.   \u201cTwo years ago, when I started, having a care coordinator in the office was a very new concept,\u201d says Sandra Siegel, RN, of Hunterdon Healthcare Partners. \u201cWell, have things changed in two years!\u201d   Siegel is a population care coordinator employed by Hunterdon Healthcare Partners (HHP), a for-profit arm of Hunterdon Medical Center in Flemington, N.J., that manages its integrated delivery system and forms an accountable care organization (ACO) under the Affordable Care Act (ACA). Though HHP cuts her paycheck, Siegel is closely linked to two other entities: She spends her days \u201cembedded\u201d in a Hillsborough, N.J.-based primary care practice called Your Doctors Care, and she\u2019s part of an initiative sponsored by Horizon Blue Cross Blue Shield of New Jersey, the Garden State\u2019s largest health insurer with 3.7 million members. Horizon BCBS runs the state\u2019s largest patient-centered medical home (PCMH) program, of which roughly 200 population care coordinators statewide are a part. At Your Doctors Care, she works with a patient panel mainly of Horizon members. But physicians and patients alike know one thing about Siegel: She\u2019s not the enemy. \u201cMy impact now is much greater than it was in my old job because I get to talk to patients,\u201d she says. \u201cI get to find out what barriers they face \u2014 barriers to being compliant with medications, for example \u2014 and determine what we can do to help them take better care of themselves. Because if you don\u2019t drill down and find out what\u2019s really going on, you\u2019re not going to make a difference.\u201d Siegel and her fellow coordinators in the Horizon program play a vital role in the effort the insurer is making, in common with many of its fellows across the country, to deliver timelier, more effective, less wasteful care by turning the primary care practice into a PCMH \u2014 \u201cone point of contact for all your health care needs,\u201d as a Horizon BCBS brochure tells its members. Reinventing primary care Horizon BCBS\u2019s goal in launching its PCMH program, says Carl Rathjen, manager of network strategy and program development, was to promote a culture of change in the primary care practice. Change has certainly been in the air nationally, with the ACA and every expert calling for a new emphasis on prevention. And if that weren\u2019t enough, the need for a change in primary care was also suggested by the field\u2019s scary demographics, with dwindling numbers of medical school grads choosing primary care specialties and pros in the field burning out faster than their specialist colleagues.  \u201cHorizon wants to promote a culture of change in primary care practices, says Carl Rathjen, the health plan\u2019s manager of network strategy and program development. That was one of the insurer\u2019s goals in launching its patient-centered medical home program.  In the PCMH model, as a 2012 Health Affairs article by Rathjen and two Horizon colleagues put it, \u201cPrimary care becomes the focal point for the delivery system because of its ability to provide patient-centered, comprehensive coordinated health care to patient populations \u2014 care that goes beyond the mere provision of basic services.\u201d To bring costs down and quality up, the theory goes, doctors\u2019 offices on a vast scale must stop simply waiting for patients to come in the door and start proactively managing their health. That\u2019s what Siegel tries to do, working with other staffers at Your Doctors Care. \u201cI never do the same thing two days in a row,\u201d she reports with satisfaction. But the thrust of what she does each day is to reach out to high-risk patients before they have an expensive medical crisis so they can get the care they need to head that crisis off. \u201cA lot of it involves keeping people out of the hospital,\u201d says Siegel. \u201cThat is, keeping people healthy so they don\u2019t need to go to the hospital.\u201d Patients are stratified according to risk based on claim reports provided to practices monthly by Horizon, and people rated at the highest risk levels become the subject of outreach. Explains Siegel: \u201cWe can run a report on our hypertensive patients, our diabetic patients, or our patients with congestive heart failure and ask, \u2018Are they coming in for their scheduled appointments? Are they getting the care they need?\u2019 For example, we might say, \u2018How about Mary Smith? She\u2019s multimorbid, Level 5, yet she hasn\u2019t been in for six months. Why not?\u2019 We don\u2019t just wait until she gets sick. Mary gets a call.\u201d Rathjen says that \u201cThe core concept of this model is to strengthen the relationship between our members and their physicians through payer-provider collaboration.\u201d Indeed, one mark of this collaborative approach is that risk scores aren\u2019t just handed down to practices like edicts from on high; the doctor, who knows his or her patients, makes the final decisions.   Mary Aikins, RN, of Horizon, says, \u201cWe hear frequently about the difference population care coordinators make.\u201d Both patients and doctors value the PCMH effort, she adds.   Explains Mary Aikins, RN, Horizon\u2019s manager of care management operations: \u201cThe doctor takes the risk scores we provide for patients based on claims data and asks, \u2018Do I as the physician agree that they\u2019re high-risk?\u2019 So claims information isn\u2019t the be-all and end-all. The doctor may say, \u2018I know Joe Jones had a lot of claims last year, but that was because of a back injury that has been resolved; he\u2019s now healthy. But 55-year-old Al Clark, who doesn\u2019t exercise and has a tough family heart-disease history \u2014 I call him high-risk even though he doesn\u2019t yet show up in your claims data.\u2019 So it may be Clark who gets contacted.\u201d PCMH designation Specifically, it\u2019s a division within Horizon called Horizon Healthcare Innovations (HHI) that runs the insurer\u2019s four-year-old PCMH initiative. To be part of the program, Horizon encourages practices to work toward designation as a PCMH from an accrediting body such as the National Committee for Quality Assurance, URAC, or the Joint Commission.   That means, of course, that they agree to use electronic medical records and provide the data necessary to evaluate care. They also must have evening and weekend hours \u2014 and round-the-clock access to physician advice \u2014 to minimize emergency room visits. When a practice meets these responsibilities and is allowed to participate, Horizon provides initial and ongoing training for the coordinators. Siegel remembers taking a rigorous 12-week graduate course in population care coordination given at Duke University School of Nursing in Durham, N.C., in collaboration with Rutgers University School of Nursing in Newark. Horizon has since designed its own two-day, in-state learning collaborative to offer the program more frequently to incoming population care coordinators. These sessions include training on Horizon-developed tools to support population management. Horizon also pays practices a monthly care coordination fee to subsidize the coordinators\u2019 paychecks. That fee is reduced after the first two years, but by then the successful practice is earning more by meeting tough benchmarks for quality, utilization, and patient experience. New role for nurses \u201cIt\u2019s one of the distinctive features of our program that we require these population care coordinators to be registered nurses,\u201d says Aikins, who has 17 years\u2019 experience running a case management company and was involved in planning the coordinator role for Horizon from the beginning. Indeed, agrees Steven Peskin, MD, HHI\u2019s senior medical director, this unusual use of nurses is a potential model for other health plans. \u201cNurses have been working in similar roles for hospitals and large integrated health systems for years,\u201d he says. \u201cBut we think it\u2019s novel that a payer has implemented this RN function that operates within primary care practices.\u201d (Full disclosure: Peskin is a former executive vice president and chief medical officer at MediMedia USA., which publishes Managed Care.)   \u201cWe think it\u2019s novel that a payer has implemented this RN function that operates within primary care practices,\u201d says Steven Peskin, MD, the senior medical director at Horizon Healthcare Innovations.  \u201cThis is a very distinct role from what nurses traditionally have done within the managed care industry,\u201d agrees Rathjen. \u201cAs care coordinators, these nurses actively engage the patients to keep them healthy, not just speak to them when they are sick.\u201d Nurses have both the clinical authority and the people skills to build the necessary trust with patients, he says. \u201cWe wanted people with significant clinical expertise who could communicate with patients so that patients would act on what they recommend.\u201d Says Aikins: \u201cIn many situations, patients prefer to be engaged with, as opposed to being \u2018managed\u2019 or \u2018directed\u2019 in the traditional insurance-company case-management or utilization management functions \u2014 although we have those too.\u201d It started with eight Horizon\u2019s PCMH program began in 2009 with an initial focus only on patients with diabetes. Some 33 practices qualified to participate. Costs were reduced, but as the Health Affairs article explained, \u201cthe reduction was not enough to cover all of the up-front costs incurred by Horizon.\u201d In discussions with the New Jersey Academy of Family Physicians and participating doctors, the insurer decided to put more chips on the table. It designated just eight practices as participating PCMHs and assigned each a population care coordinator to work not only on diabetic patients, but on all patients. At that point, the coordinators were direct Horizon employees. \u201cI started with eight nurses,\u201d Aikins recalls. \u201cBack then we didn\u2019t have a lot of the reports we have today, and we had to develop a training program. We\u2019ve moved away from Horizon being the employer; now we provide a subsidy and the population care coordinators are employed by the practices.\u201d In cases like Siegel\u2019s, they are employed by an integrated delivery system. With initial results promising, the program was \u201cscaled up\u201d to where it now involves about 200 practices around the state. And as Peskin points out, Horizon \u201ccontinues to support the participating practices with training and mentoring.\u201d The culture change didn\u2019t happen overnight, and it wasn\u2019t all the population care coordinators\u2019 doing. Every member of the PCMH practices learned to do his or her part to facilitate proactive care. And everyone faced a learning curve \u2014 including doctors. \u201cTwo years ago, when I started, having a care coordinator in the office was a very new concept,\u201d says Siegel. \u201cDoctors and office staff weren\u2019t sure what to do with us. Well, have things changed in two years!\u201d Today, she says, \u201cour front-office staff has been educated. They do a fabulous job of helping to identify high-risk patients when they call or come in and helping us triage and figure out what\u2019s going on.\u201d The idea, as Aikins explains it, is to have every member of the practice staff working to the top of his or her license. \u201cWe work as a team,\u201d says Siegel. \u201cThe coordinators don\u2019t direct care or come up with treatment plans, but the doctor may say, \u2018Why don\u2019t you sit down and do some diabetes education with this patient?\u2019 Or it may be hypertension or weight-loss counseling.\u201d Data from 2013, released in July, suggest that the Horizon PCMH program is making a difference. (See \u201cBut Does It Work? The Horizon PCMH Record\u201d below.) And Siegel offers anecdotal evidence that her workdays now are not only more satisfying, but also more effective than were her struggles to limit hospital stays back in the \u201990s. She recalls with satisfaction that when one patient was having a crisis that was beyond what her primary care practice could deal with, she got on the phone and invoked her relationship with Hunterdon Medical Center. Such is Siegel\u2019s concern for the patient privacy requirements of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) that she declines to identify even the specialist\u2019s clinical area, but she got the person in to see the appropriate specialist within three hours.
