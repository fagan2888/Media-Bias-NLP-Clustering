Lululemon got some unwanted attention last year after it recalled its “see through” athletic pants, but now the clothing company is ready to get in on the joke.

Jimmy Kimmel spoofed Lululemon on his late night show last Thursday, running a fake ad for spray-on yoga pants called “Lululemon Pledge.”

“When they spray on, they stay on,” a voice-over says.

Lululemon took it in stride and added the phony product to its website. For only $1,200 — that’s 1,200 pairs of pants per can — Lululemon Pledge “fits like a second skin.” The rise, leg opening, and inseam are all “adjustable,” says the ad.

As Business Insider spotted, Lululemon added the product to its website ahead of April Fools’ Day and tweeted the big news.
