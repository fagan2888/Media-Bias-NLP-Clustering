Passed in 2011 by the Republican-dominated Legislature, the law accepts as proof of identity a concealed-weapon permit but not a student ID card.\n\nLaws like these used to be blocked by Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act, which required that the federal government preapprove any voting rules enacted by states and localities with a history of discriminatory voting practices. But in a destructive ruling last year, the Supreme Court rendered Section 5 useless when it struck down Section 4, which set the formula for covered jurisdictions, as unconstitutional.\n\nOnly hours after that ruling, Texas resurrected its voter-ID law, which had been stopped by Section 5.\n\nDefenders of voting rights are now using a different part of the Voting Rights Act to challenge such laws, but it is a time-consuming and costly process.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn the Texas suit, testimony has shown that about 1.2 million eligible voters \u2014 including disproportionate numbers of lower-income, black and Latino voters, who tend to vote Democratic \u2014 lack a photo ID that would allow them to cast a ballot. Some never had the necessary underlying documents, such as a birth certificate; others cannot afford the time or money it takes to track them down.\n\nThe lawmakers who insist that this law is needed never bothered to come up with evidence of any voter fraud. One former election official testified that in-person fraud is \u201calmost impossible to do.\u201d\n\nTexas says it has made it easier to get a photo ID by providing for a free \u201cElection Identification Certificate.\u201d Apparently, Texans haven\u2019t gotten the memo: as of Friday, fewer than 300 people statewide had managed to obtain a certificate.\n\nOf course, voter-ID laws have never been about making voting easier. They are virtually always Republican-led efforts to keep groups of eligible voters who are more likely to vote Democratic from the polls.\n\nThe laws\u2019 backers rely on a 2008 Supreme Court ruling upholding an Indiana voter-ID law, but at least two of the judges in that case have since admitted they were wrong. Richard Posner, a federal appeals court judge who approved the law, said last fall that voter-ID laws were \u201cnow widely regarded as a means of voter suppression rather than of fraud prevention.\u201d And former Justice John Paul Stevens, who voted with the majority, said that in retrospect the dissent was \u201cdead right.\u201d\n\nRather than find a way to appeal to a wider swath of voters, Republican lawmakers rig the game with pointless obstacles to voting. The courts are finally catching on, but in the meantime, many of the nation\u2019s most vulnerable citizens are shut out of the democratic process.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "opinion", "ptime": 20140907201625, "twitter": {"description": "An absurdly strict law that accepts as proof of identity a concealed-weapon permit but not a student identification card is being challenged in court.", "title": "Voter ID on Trial in Texas", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/08/opinion/voter-id-on-trial-in-texas.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003098311"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_150_black.png", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/08/opinion/voter-id-on-trial-in-texas.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003098311", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/08/opinion/voter-id-on-trial-in-texas.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "opinion", "channels": "NytNow", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "Sept. 7, 2014", "edt": "NewYork", "article": {"author": "http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/opinion/editorialboard.html", "section_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/pages/opinion/index.html", "section": "Opinion", "modified": "2014-09-11", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "tag": "Voting and Voters", "published": "2014-09-07", "section-taxonomy-id": "AD8090D7-4137-4D71-84C8-70DA3BD89778"}, "keywords": "Voter Registration and Requirements,Texas,Supreme Court (US),Editorials,Voting Rights Act (1965),Identification Devices,Justice Department,Voting and Voters", "news_keywords": "Texas,Editorial", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "The Editorial Board", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "byl": "By THE EDITORIAL BOARD", "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "An absurdly strict law that accepts as proof of identity a concealed-weapon permit but not a student identification card is being challenged in court.", "tom": "Editorial", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "description": "An absurdly strict law that accepts as proof of identity a concealed-weapon permit but not a student identification card is being challenged in court.", "CG": "opinion", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "Sept. 7, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "Editorial", "org": "Justice Department", "geo": "Texas", "slug": "08mon1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20140911022603, "hdl_p": "Voter ID on Trial in Texas", "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/08/opinion/voter-id-on-trial-in-texas.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_291_black.png", "type": "article", "description": "An absurdly strict law that accepts as proof of identity a concealed-weapon permit but not a student identification card is being challenged in court.", "title": "Voter ID on Trial in Texas"}, "pdate": 20140907, "des": "Voting and Voters", "articleid": 100000003098311, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "Voter ID on Trial in Texas", "col": "Editorial", "PST": "Editorial"}, "article_summary": "The lawmakers who insist that this law is needed never bothered to come up with evidence of any voter fraud.\nOnly hours after that ruling, Texas resurrected its voter-ID law, which had been stopped by Section 5.\nLast week, the spotlight turned to the federal court in Corpus Christi, where the Justice Department and several advocacy groups are fighting Texas\u2019 absurdly strict voter-ID law.\nPassed in 2011 by the Republican-dominated Legislature, the law accepts as proof of identity a concealed-weapon permit but not a student ID card.\nOf course, voter-ID laws have never been about making voting easier."}
