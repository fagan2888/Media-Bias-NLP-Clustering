(AP) - On a recent cross-country ski trip in the Bridger Mountains, I noticed my dog was walking a little funny. It was a frigid day and close to a foot of snow had fallen the night before. Kato, who burst out of his kennel with his usual exuberance at the car park, was looking chilly on the trail.\n\nAt first, Kato - a 9-year-old mixed breed cattle dog - was pausing to chew the snowballs out from between his pads. I\u2019d seen him do this plenty of times in the past and thought little of it, but then he began to sit down, and finally he started to seek out spots beneath the trees that weren\u2019t snow covered.\n\nWhile Kato has always been a trooper, I grew concerned.\n\n\u201cIf it is below zero, you might want to really think about being outside with your dog,\u201d said Dr. Spencer Anderson of Baxter Creek Veterinary Clinic in Bozeman. \u201cIt is very dog dependent, and a lot of it has to do with acclimation, but you need to know your dog.\u201d\n\nAnderson said he rarely sees cases of hypothermia in dogs. Many breeds, such as Labrador Retrievers, Siberian Huskies, Chesapeake Bay Retrievers and Alaskan Malamutes, are built for the cold. Even in shorthaired dogs like Hungarian Vizslas and German Shorthaired Pointers, which generally have low body fat in addition to a fine coat, hypothermia is uncommon.\n\nIf you see your dog shivering and they can\u2019t stop, it is a clear sign that their core body temperature has dropped. Dogs that are too cold may curl up into a ball or repeatedly look for areas to bed down. Anderson said if you think your dog is too cold, give them food and keep them moving.\n\n\u201cThey will be warmer and better able to generate heat when they are moving,\u201d Anderson said. \u201cIf they can\u2019t move, get them out of the wind or to a place you can build a fire and get them warm and dry. It\u2019s just like treating a person with hypothermia.\u201d\n\nAnderson said more common winter maladies for our canine companions come in the form of frozen extremities, lacerations and orthopedic injuries.\n\nExposed or poorly insulated tissue around the eyes, ears, nose and tail can become frozen when exposed to extreme cold. The pads of the feet are also susceptible. Anderson said keep an eye in the snow for spots of blood, which could indicate frostbite.\n\nJosh Allen, owner of Dee-O-Gee in Bozeman, said booties made for dogs offer a degree of protection during cold weather outings. Booties can be as simple as latex balloons that fit over your pup\u2019s paws, or highly specialized footwear with Vibram soles, aggressive tread and fabric gaiters.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t know looking at a dog walking in here if they would tolerate a bootie,\u201d Allen said, \u201cbut if it is introduced correctly and sized properly, dogs will generally wear them.\u201d\n\nTo prevent the ice chunks from forming between the pads of your dog\u2019s feet, Allen recommends a product called Musher\u2019s Secret. Developed by sled dog racers, the salve coats the hair between the pads and prevents snow and ice from building up.\n\nDog vests are another popular product for pets that like to recreate in the cold. Made from neoprene, wool or other fabrics, the vests function just a like a coat, insulating the torso.\n\nOne of the most common ailments Anderson treats is lacerations. Whether the result of a cut from a shard of ice or being run over by a ski, cuts are a common winter injury for dogs. Anderson said to bandage the wound in the field if possible before transporting your pet back to town.\n\nOrthopedic issues can also plague dogs during the winter months. As dogs age they may develop arthritis, which can be exasperated by cold temperatures. Dogs suffering from arthritic pain may appear stiff or uncomfortable while walking.\n\nAnderson said ACL and back injures often strike dogs during the winter. Post holing through the snow or slipping on ice frequently result in injury.\n\n\u201cYou get those dogs porpoising like crazy through deep snow and they may develop a sore back,\u201d Anderson said. \u201cIf you can run them on packed snow, that is a good idea.\u201d\n\nFor people who leave their pets outside during the day, Anderson said the American Veterinary Medical Association (www.avma.org) and the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (www.aspca.org) publish guidelines on safe shelter for dogs during the winter months.\n\n\u201cA lot of it is common sense,\u201d Anderson said. \u201cIf you have a dog that just flat won\u2019t quit, you have to be careful. You have to know your dog.\u201d\n\n____\n\nThe original story can be found on the Bozeman Daily Chronicle\u2019s website: http://bit.ly/1GQKYB4", "article_metadata": {"description": "On a recent cross-country ski trip in the Bridger Mountains, I noticed my dog was walking a little funny.
