Others offer brochures listing calories, sugar and cholesterol for those who ask. Soon, many restaurants across the country will be expected to tell their customers what\u2019s in their food because of the new federal health-care law.\n\nBut in Prince George\u2019s County, where many of the nearly 1 million residents suffer disproportionately from diabetes, heart disease, high blood pressure and obesity, County Council member Eric Olson (D-College Park) wants restaurants to do more.\n\nOlson is proposing a bill that would require prominent display not only of calories, which the federal law would require, but also of sodium. If approved, the measure would affect restaurants with at least five sites in Prince George\u2019s, or about 300 of the county\u2019s 3,025 restaurants. Olson hopes other restaurants not covered by his plan would volunteer the information.\n\nSodium, which is used liberally in prepared food and at restaurants to help retain flavor, can be a health hazard. It is easy to quickly ingest too much, and excess sodium consumption can lead to high blood pressure and heart disease. Because of the prevalence of those illnesses in Prince George\u2019s, Olson believes that the county is a good place to require sodium disclosure on menus. The council is scheduled to discuss the bill Oct. 10.\n\n\u201cIt is a health issue,\u201d Olson said. \u201cThis is a consumer-friendly bill: It gives customers information. It should not be something you have to go search for.\u201d\n\nThat might not be enough to turn his proposal into law. By insisting on posting sodium information so prominently, Olson\u2019s bill goes beyond the requirements of the federal Affordable Care Act, which compels restaurants with 20 or more sites across the country to post calorie information on menus and menu boards.\n\nThe law allows restaurants to provide other data, such as sodium content, in a separate brochure. Smaller chains and individually owned restaurants are generally exempt.\n\nIn 2010, Montgomery County began requiring restaurants with 20 or more sites across the country to list calories on menus. About 820 of that county\u2019s nearly 3700 restaurants are required to list calories, a county spokeswoman said.\n\nDan Roehl of the National Restaurant Association and Mel Thompson of the Restaurant Association of Maryland said they support menu labeling but are leery of Olson\u2019s bill for Prince George\u2019s, which they said would increase costs because chain restaurants would have to produce different menus for the county.\n\nNational standards, Roehl said, are preferable because they allow mass printing of menus, which saves money. They also give consumers an opportunity \u201cto have everything in the same format so they can compare,\u201d he said.\n\nA July study by the University of Maryland that polled 129 diners in Montgomery said it is far from clear that disclosing calories has changed habits.\n\n\u201cWomen really appreciate it. Men, not so much,\u201d said County Council member George L. Leventhal (D-At Large).\n\nAnd young adults, the study found, ignore the data.\n\n\u201cWhen you are dealing with personal habits and the government\u2019s ability to influence it, that is obviously limited,\u201d Leventhal said.\n\nOnly a handful of other places, including California, Vermont and Philadelphia, have laws for menu labeling. Philadelphia is alone in requiring sodium content on menus and menu boards, Olson said.\n\nSome restaurants across the country voluntarily provide calorie and other data because they say their customers want it and believe it is good for business, said Margo Wootan, head of nutrition policy for the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a longtime advocate of menu labeling.\n\nBelinda Queen, who takes care of foster children in her Capitol Heights home, said consumers need as much information as possible to help them make better choices about what they eat.\n\n\u201cAnything that will help people get more healthy,\u201d she said. \u201cI believe it is something the government needs to do.\u201d\n\nBut diners also need to act on the information, she said. \u201cIf it is truly going to help, people have to read the information and be willing to make a change in their eating,\u201d Queen said.\n\nHer community is part of an area in Prince George\u2019s that in November was declared a food desert by the U.S. Department of Agriculture because residents has limited access to healthful food.\n\n\u201cThey buy Oodles of Noodles because they are trying to save a buck,\u201d Queen said.\n\nDespite the potential obstacles, Olson says he will push for sodium labeling and will urge County Executive Rushern L. Baker III (D) to seek a waiver from the federal rules. Philadelphia has asked for the exemption, a city health spokesman said.\n\n\u201cThat would be worth fighting for,\u201d Olson said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Affordable care act requires calories on menus and menu boards, but Prince George\u2019s official wants more", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/miranda.spivack", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Affordable care act requires calories on menus and menu boards, but Prince George\u2019s official wants more", "title": "Pr.
