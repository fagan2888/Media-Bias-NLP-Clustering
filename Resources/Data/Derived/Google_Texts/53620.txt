Southwest Airlines announced Tuesday that the carrier has reached a tentative agreement with the union representing its AirTran Airways flight attendants.

While Southwest’s acquisition of its a wholly-owned subsidiary AirTran is scheduled to be complete by the end of 2014, this agreement — if ratified — would cover 1,700 AirTran attendants for the duration of the merger process until those employees fully transition to Southwest.

The agreement with the Association of Flight Attendants-CWA (AFA) still must be ratified by its members.

“I applaud the efforts of both parties in reaching an agreement that incorporates rewards and incentives for increased productivity and perfect attendance, while remaining mindful of AirTran’s low cost structure,” said Mike Hafner, Southwest Airlines Vice President of Cabin Services, in a statement. “This contract includes progressive concepts that are beneficial for AirTran Flight Attendants, while supporting Company objectives.”

What exactly these “progressive concepts” involve remains unclear as details of the agreement have not been released. The agreement became amendable in May and the two side began talks in February.

Southwest Airlines is the second largest carrier at Denver International Airport, claiming 26 percent of the market share in June. The carrier officially acquired AirTran in May 2011 and have since been going through the process of merging the carriers.
