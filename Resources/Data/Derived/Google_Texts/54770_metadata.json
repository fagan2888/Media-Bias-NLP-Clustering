As GOP lawmakers saw it, they\u2019d refuse to fund the cabinet agency unless Democrats agreed to destroy President Obama\u2019s immigration policy \u2013 but it was painfully obvious all along that Dems would never accept such terms.\n\nThe resolution was always going to be the same: Congress would have to pass a \u201cclean\u201d DHS bill, funding the department, and go after the White House\u2019s immigration policy through the courts. It was only a matter of time before Republicans realized they had no other credible option\n\nHouse Speaker John Boehner told congressional Republicans Tuesday morning that he will bring up a vote to pass a \u201cclean\u201d bill to fund the Department of Homeland Security with no strings attached, according to NBC News. With his back up against a wall and funding for the critical government agency set to run dry by Friday at midnight, Boehner alerted the House GOP conference during a closed door session Tuesday that the lower chamber will be voting on the clean bill as early as that afternoon. Boehner\u2019s announcement was met with dead silence from the room, NBC News reported.\n\nRep. Steve King (R-Iowa), one of Congress\u2019 fiercest anti-immigrant voices, told the AP after the meeting that this resolution is \u201cthe signal of capitulation,\u201d a complaint that happens to be true. But again, the question has always been when, not whether, congressional Republicans would fund Homeland Security. They could play games, fight with one another, point fingers, and make all kinds of threats, but sooner or later, a clean bill would clear Capitol Hill and become law.\n\nBoehner could have saved himself quite a bit of hassle and humiliation if he\u2019d guided his conference in this direction weeks ago \u2013 the Speaker knew as well as anyone that this day was inevitable \u2013 but he just isn\u2019t in a strong enough position to lead effectively.\n\nOn the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue, meanwhile, there\u2019s President Obama, who\u2019s won another round.\n\nNotice the familiarity of the pattern . In the fall of 2013, Boehner & Co.. said they were prepared to shut down the government unless Obama agreed to start dismantling the Affordable Care Act. The president made clear he wouldn\u2019t play any games \u2013 when Congress sent a clean spending bill to the White House, Obama would sign it, and the political world could move on. Until then, he\u2019d ignore the noise.\n\nReality didn\u2019t set in until after a pointless, costly shutdown, but eventually the president got his way.\n\nA few months later, GOP lawmakers raised the specter of a debt-ceiling crisis, prompting the president to make clear there just wasn\u2019t any point \u2013 he wouldn\u2019t give Congress a far-right reward for doing what they have to do anyway. Republicans soon after backed down.\n\nLate last year, the GOP was once again threatening a shutdown, and once again, Obama got his way while standing firm.\n\nFor many Beltway pundits, the president just doesn\u2019t \u201clead\u201d enough for their liking \u2013 he\u2019s all brain and no backbone, they say. But the truth is, Obama\u2019s effective leadership in the face of repeated GOP hostage strategies is evident for anyone who looks. The president keeps drawing lines, telling Congress how it has to be, and waiting for lawmakers to agree \u2013 which they inevitably do.\n\nTo be sure, Obama hasn\u2019t always understood this as well as he does now \u2013 he thought he could negotiate with Boehner during the 2011 debt-ceiling crisis, which proved to be impossible \u2013 but the president has learned from experience.\n\nHas the House Speaker?\n\nA s we discussed yesterday, this isn\u2019t the last fight of the 114th Congress; it\u2019s the first. If recent history is any guide, new crises are on the way, with standoffs related to the debt ceiling, the Highway Trust Fund, and in the fall, the federal budget.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "description": "House Republicans keep trying to test President Obama.
