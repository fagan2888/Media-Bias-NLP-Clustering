Hilton pleaded guilty 30 days later.\n\nHowever, these cases represent high-profile exceptions to the rule, where even with plea deals, cases take at least six months.\n\nOne of the most recent murder pleas involved Ronnie Rucker, who stood accused of stabbing his grandmother Lula Bell Howard repeatedly May 2. Rucker pleaded guilty Dec. 9.\n\nLast week, Superior Court Judge Andrew Fuller took up the case of Mark Alan Fyfe, who was charged with the Christmas Day 2013 murder of his brother Alan Scott Fyfe. Fyfe agreed to a negotiated plea on a voluntary manslaughter charge ahead of his April trial date.\n\nParticularly with violent crimes like that of the Sun Suites murder, the district attorney\u2019s office early on is working alongside police.\n\n\u201cWhen investigating these types of serious cases, we typically work with the district attorney\u2019s office,\u201d Gainesville Police Cpl. Kevin Holbrook said.\n\nLaw enforcement\u2019s involvement, however, ends at the point that evidence is turned over to the district attorney\u2019s office.\n\n\u201cOf course it helps to expedite the process when the investigators have completed their report and have submitted all of their evidence,\u201d Hall County Sheriff\u2019s Office spokeswoman Deputy Nicole Bailes wrote in an email. \u201cThis allows the defense attorney to observe all of the evidence against their client when the negotiations start.\u201d\n\nDarragh declined to speak about any case specifically, saying certain cases can end quickly when the district attorney\u2019s office hopes to accommodate the less expensive plea deal ahead of a trial.\n\n\u201cIn some cases, a defendant is willing to both recognize or take responsibility for his guilt very early on,\u201d Darragh said. \u201cIt is important to my office that we proceed on homicide cases as quickly as we can, because as time moves on, it can become more expensive and unduly time consuming.\u201d\n\nDelays in the adjudication of murder cases can depend on the available evidence, Darragh said, and if it is enough to proceed to a true bill indictment.\n\nOther times, defendants and their attorneys will file \u201cvoluminous motions\u201d that take time to work through in the courts and wait in line behind the other cases, Darragh said.\n\n\u201cSometimes a defendant, even in the face of overwhelming evidence, has reluctance to enter a plea of guilty, and it takes time to get it to an actual jury trial where that\u2019s appropriate,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.gainesvilletimes.com/archives/108767/", "image": "http://media.morristechnology.com/webmedia/facebook_share_images/gainesville/020216thetimesogimgoptimzed.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "For fans of the TV crime procedural, each episode\u2019s case is wrapped up with a neat bow in 60 minutes.", "title": "A rarity: Murder case ends quickly in hotel slaying"}, "twitter": {"site": "@gtimes", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noarchive", "title": "A rarity: Murder case ends quickly in hotel slaying"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9e09\"", "article_summary": "The two-month process from Lavender\u2019s death to disposition moved quicker than most Hall County murder cases in the past few years.\nParticularly with violent crimes like that of the Sun Suites murder, the district attorney\u2019s office early on is working alongside police.\nTV drama is typically far from reality, yet one rare Hall County case recently came close.\nDarragh pointed to one other, the Dawson County case concerning Gary Hilton, when Meredith Emerson went missing while hiking on Jan. 1, 2008.\nLaw enforcement\u2019s involvement, however, ends at the point that evidence is turned over to the district attorney\u2019s office."}
