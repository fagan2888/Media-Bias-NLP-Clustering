Add up the state, city and public transit portions, and the total sales tax rate in Chicago once again will hit 10.25 percent \u2014 one of the highest rates in the nation.\n\nThat means after Jan. 1, when the sales tax hike goes into effect, buying a $1,000 item, such as a new washer and dryer, would cost an extra $10. The total sales tax on such a purchase would be $102.50.\n\nThe most controversial vote of Preckwinkle's five-year tenure, which came after 4 1/2 hours of testimony, debate and parliamentary maneuvering, was replete with irony. Preckwinkle first rose to power in 2010 on a campaign pledge of repealing what remained of an identical sales tax increase under predecessor Todd Stroger. She even ran a TV ad featuring a Ben Franklin impersonator in which she reminded voters that \"a penny saved is a penny earned.\"\n\nPreckwinkle kept that pledge in part by cutting payroll, streamlining operations, reducing the number of jail inmates and taking advantage of increased federal funding under the Affordable Care Act for the county's vast public health system. After winning re-election without opposition, however, she pushed the sales tax hike as a way to restore financial health to the county's underfunded pension system, cover payments for debt incurred before she took office and spend more on roads and bridges.\n\n\"I'm probably the last person in Cook County to want to increase the sales tax,\" Preckwinkle told commissioners during a rare appearance at a Finance Committee meeting where a test vote was taken. \"However, I know it's the right \u2014 the only \u2014 course of action, to ensure the long-term sustainability of our county government. I stand by that.\"\n\nLater, the Democratic leader from Hyde Park told reporters the county faces a \"pension tsunami.\" The retirement fund is $6.5 billion in the hole, an amount she said is growing by $360 million a year. Continuing that trend would have pushed even greater debt on future generations, she maintained. The sales tax hike will generate an estimated $474 million a year.\n\nIt was unclear until Wednesday morning whether Preckwinkle had gathered enough votes to win approval. The last commissioner to show his hand was Luis Arroyo Jr., D-Chicago. When the Chicago Tribune first reported Preckwinkle was pursuing the sales tax increase last month, Arroyo said residents in his West Side district opposed it. On Wednesday, he voted for it.\n\nAfter the vote, Commissioner John Daley, a close Preckwinkle ally and brother of the former mayor, moved across the Board Room floor to shake Arroyo's hand.\n\nCook County sales tax increase Cook County sales tax will increase Jan. 1, 2016, to 10.25 percent.

Smart politics says you get something in return for such a big vote, but publicly admitting that can make a politician look ethically compromised.\n\nWhen the tax was increased by a penny on the dollar under Stroger in 2008, Commissioner Larry Suffredin was the ninth vote in favor. In exchange, Stroger agreed to set up an independent board to oversee the county's health system.\n\nThis time around, Suffredin was opposed. \"Good intentions and good purposes don't improve bad tax policy, and the sales tax is bad tax policy,\" said Suffredin, who added that businesses bordering other counties will be harmed by a higher tax. \"We are hurting Cook County by this vote.\"\n\nAlso voting against the tax increase were three Republicans and three other Democrats who've been mentioned as potential candidates for higher office. One of them was freshman Commissioner Richard Boykin, D-Oak Park, who railed against the tax increase for several minutes in the longest speech of the day.\n\n\"This tax increase will earn Cook County the distinction of having the most regressive tax structure in the nation,\" said Boykin, who added, \"We haven't done our job in terms of cost-cutting.\"\n\nBoykin then singled out Preckwinkle, saying she was wrong to propose the tax increase before presenting her budget later this year. \"It seems clear that whatever final product turns out to look like, President Preckwinkle has already decided who she wants to pay,\" Boykin said. \"She wants the poorest residents of Cook County to pay the most.\"\n\nThat triggered criticism from Commissioners Jerry \"Iceman\" Butler, D-Chicago, and Jeffrey Tobolski, D-McCook, both of whom voted for the increase. Butler derided an hour of debate \"about nothing\" on a Boykin amendment that was soundly defeated and said, \"Clever has no color. To wrap this question into this amendment is good politics, but bad in terms of how we're going to work ourselves through this budget.\"\n\nTobolski added: \"I think you need to be on the board a little more than seven months before you have a clear understanding of what's happening here. My dad told me this many years ago, and I quote this quite often: 'Keep my mouth shut, my eyes and my ears open, and you might learn a few things.' \"\n\nThe other unsure vote going into the meeting was that of Commissioner Elizabeth Gorman, R-Orland Park, whose impending retirement to take a job as a government affairs director for an unnamed Fortune 100 company became known shortly before the meeting.
