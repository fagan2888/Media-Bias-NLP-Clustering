It didn’t take long for comedian Seth Rogen and actor James Franco to make fun of Kimye again, this time, for their April Vogue cover.

Over the weekend, the Twitter community was thoroughly unimpressed with Vogue’s wedding-inspired Kim Kardashian and Kanye West cover. Naturally, being the jokesters that they are, Rogen and Franco decided to give the people what they want: their recreation of the cover photo.

It had to be done: pic.twitter.com/EXH2NJI3m9 — Seth Rogen (@Sethrogen) March 22, 2014

Twitter definitely loves the Rogen-Franco duo. And they seemed to love the duo’s parody much more than they loved the original cover shot.

Rogen and Franco have parodied Kimye before, with raging success. Just last year, the two made a parody to West’s racy music video for “Bound 2.” The music video featured West riding a motorcycle while Kardashian — topless — draped herself all over him. In their shot-for-shot recreation, Rogen — also topless — played Kardashian and Franco played West, with hilarious results.

Thank you, Seth Rogen and James Franco. http://t.co/obZwSMsKjT — Kevin Kennie (@headstartrock) March 23, 2014
