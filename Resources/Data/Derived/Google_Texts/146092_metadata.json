Or shape future generations?\n\n\n\n\u0093I signed on mainly,\u0094 he says, \u0093because my wife and I needed the health insurance.\u0094\n\n\n\nLittle did he know what else he would reap.\n\n\n\nKeizer has written nonfiction ever since he left his native New Jersey 35 years ago and, taking a job at Lake Region Union High School in Orleans, chronicled his work in the 1988 memoir \u0093No Place But Here: A Teacher\u0092s Vocation in a Rural Community.\u0094\n\n\n\nRetiring from the profession in 1996, he has published seven more books. In the summer of 2010, he promoted one on \u0093The Colbert Report.\u0094 Then that fall, lacking medical coverage before the rollout of Obamacare, he relinquished his writing career and returned to the classroom.\n\n\n\nEnd of story? Keizer thought so, figuring 80 students handing in one assignment a day would, if he spent just 10 minutes correcting each, swallow nearly 14 hours of whatever time he had left away from his chalkboard. Yet somehow he stole a few occasional minutes to scribble in his journal, which led to a 2011 Harper\u0092s essay and, this fall, a new book, \u0093Getting Schooled: The Reeducation of an American Teacher.\u0094\n\n\n\nSeeking solutions to problems plaguing today\u0092s youth?\n\n\n\n\u0093Anybody who looks to this book for a 10-point plan will be disappointed,\u0094 Keizer says.\n\n\n\nInstead, the author poses more questions than answers as he prods readers to inquire if the root cause of what\u0092s ailing public education is society itself.\n\n\n\n\u0093If I\u0092m in a supermarket and somebody says, \u0091Kids today \u0092, I\u0092m hell on wheels. One of my hopes is that people will read the book and think maybe it would behoove them to take some time before holding forth on schools to walk into one.\u0094\n\n\n\nKeizer was surprised to see what has changed since he left teaching nearly two decades ago to settle in the tucked-away town of Sutton, population 1,000, and write about life lessons and current-day conundrums.\n\n\n\nBecoming an Episcopal clergyman, the husband and father penned 1991\u0092s \u0093A Dresser of Sycamore Trees: The Finding of a Ministry,\u0094 then left that service to explore personal questions in \u0093The Enigma of Anger: Essays on a Sometimes Deadly Sin\u0094 (2002), \u0093Help: The Original Human Dilemma\u0094 (2004), \u0093The Unwanted Sound of Everything We Want: A Book About Noise\u0094 (2010) and \u0093Privacy\u0094 (2012).\n\n\n\nIn between the latter two books, Keizer unwittingly came up with his latest by taking the one-year substitute job at his old 355-student, grade 9-12 school.\n\n\n\n\u0093How did it feel to sit at a table,\u0094 he writes of his application interview, \u0093across from a principal, a director of guidance services, and two out of four school board members who are all not only younger than I but also former students of mine?\u0094\n\n\n\nNo less surprising than entering his classroom and finding a television, a desktop computer (\u0093that I\u0092m instructed never to turn off\u0094) and students asking to use the restroom to answer a different call.\n\n\n\n\u0093Texting in the boys\u0092 room,\u0094 he writes, \u0093is the new version of smoking in the boys\u0092 room.\u0094\n\n\n\nKeizer chronicles his resulting thoughts and feelings in a 320-page hardcover published by Henry Holt and Co. Technology ensnares him everywhere, from electronic attendance at the beginning of the school day to computerized grading at the end of the semester.\n\n\n\n\u0093I am increasingly devoting more time to the generation and recording of data and less time to the educational substance of what the data is supposed to measure,\u0094 he writes. \u0093Think of it as a man who develops ever more elaborate schemes for counting his money, even as he forfeits more and more of his time for earning the money he counts.\u0094\n\n\n\nStudents, for their part, talked, texted and tweeted on cellphones when not searching the Internet for synopses of his book assignments.\n\n\n\nKeizer attempted to circumvent the circuitry.\n\n\n\n\u0093Printed below is the text of a summary of chapters 6 and 7 for \u0091The Secret Life of Bees\u0092 as found on a sleazy Internet rip-off site,\u0094 he began one quiz. \u0093Read over the summary and then, based on your own reading of the chapters, list seven details, events, exchanges, or other information that the summary misses or waters down.\u0094\n\n\n\nBut also resigned himself to a hardwired reality.\n\n\n\n\u0093We inculcate in our children the sensibilities of raccoons, a fascination with shiny objects and an appetite for garbage, and then carp about \u0091the texting generation\u0092 as if 13- and 14-year-olds who couldn\u0092t boil an egg are capable of creating a culture,\u0094 he writes. \u0093They grow on what we feed them.\u0094\n\n\n\nKeizer believes what many blame as the fault of schools is more a failing of society.\n\n\n\n\u0093We make kids illiterate by shrinking and/or wiring their libraries, then we build wired support centers to teach the illiterates how to read,\u0094 he says in another example. \u0093If you want kids who can read and write, you need a culture that prizes books.\u0094\n\n\n\nKeizer\u0092s latest spills with similar insights. He notes of students: \u0093Often the most neglected kids in a school system are not the so-called troubled children; they\u0092re the struggling but mostly cooperative children whom no one troubles to give a second thought.\u0094 And of standardized tests: \u0093Yet another example of taking time away from teaching in order to test what you lack the time to teach.\u0094\n\n\n\nThe author isn\u0092t immune from scrutiny. He recounts incident after incident where he wondered if his dealings with one student in need of direction were too soft while the next too hard.\n\n\n\n\u0093It comes back to me now in a sickening wave \u0097 what I hated most about teaching, not the loss of free time and the weariness of the work, the absurd pettiness of a thousand minutiae, the hurry-up-and-wait inertia of the school routine, the interruptions tugging and blaring at you every other minute but the constant second-guessing of oneself. Anything you do is bound to be, on some level and for some kid, wrong.\u0094\n\n\n\nNot that Keizer is a pushover. When Vermont Public Radio host Jane Lindholm introduced him recently as a man known for \u0093wrangling\u0094 students, he lassoed the microphone and launched into a correction.\n\n\n\n\u0093I object to the word \u0091wrangle\u0092 as misrepresenting my teaching, but, more important, as giving an incorrect characterization to the students that I taught,\u0094 he said in a live interview. \u0093I\u0092m no cowpoke and the kids in the Northeast Kingdom are no doggies.\u0094\n\n\n\nKeizer also isn\u0092t afraid to question the New York Times. Sure it praised \u0093his beautiful book\u0094 and \u0093astounding\u0094 work ethic, opining \u0093it wouldn\u0092t hurt if we had another million Garret Keizers.\u0094 Then again, he wonders, why did that observation come at the end of a review devoted mainly to someone else\u0092s new release?\n\n\n\nThe newspaper got one thing right: Keizer is \u0093an irascible idealist.\u0094 In a recent Los Angeles Times opinion piece tied to his book, he expressed worry that Lake Region Union High School, ranked as the state\u0092s poorest based on students eligible for free or reduced-price lunches, was outperforming many others on standardized tests.\n\n\n\n\u0093As long as the test scores are at par, you see, we need not be overly concerned if the pantries are bare, the parents jobless or jailed, and the gap between rich and poor more appalling than it\u0092s been since 1928,\u0094 he wrote. \u0093If food-insecure 16-year-olds can master a prescribed curriculum, then what is the excuse of the richest nation in the world for failing to master the common core of a livable wage, a color-blind legal system and a society in which the word \u0091class\u0092 refers to a course you take and not to chances you never had?\u0094\n\n\n\nFor in the end, Keizer wasn\u0092t working for the health insurance. He just wants a better world.\n\n\n\nkevin.oconnor\n\n\n\n@rutlandherald.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGarret Keizer will read from his new book, \u0093Getting Schooled: The Reeducation of an American Teacher,\u0094 on Oct. 28 at 7 p.m. at Bear Pond Books in Montpelier.
