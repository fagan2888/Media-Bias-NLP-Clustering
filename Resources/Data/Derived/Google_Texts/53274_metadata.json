Yet every year, millions of kids as young as 4 slide into their shoulder pads and plastic-padded helmets. New research out of the Boston University School of Medicine has found definitive links between retired NFL players\u2019 brains and the brain injuries they\u2019ve incurred throughout their careers. The study, which tested 42 former professional footballers between the ages of 41 and 65, was published in the journal of Neurology this week.\n\n\u201cBeing hit in the head repeatedly through tackle football during a critical time in brain development may be associated with later-life cognitive difficulties,\u201d the study\u2019s senior author Dr. Robert Stern, a professor at the Boston University School of Medicine, told The New York Times. \u201cThe take-home message is, the earlier you start, the more issues you may have.\u201d\n\nResearchers found that the adult football players who began playing football before the age of 12 \u201cdemonstrated significantly greater impairment\u201d than those who started after. Not only did the earlier starters have a lower verbal IQ, but they also had difficulty with reasoning, planning, and memory recall. The brain development that takes place between the ages of 10 and 12 is considered one of the most crucial stages for a child. Suffering repeated brain injuries during these critically fragile periods of development could forever alter the brain's development and lead to cognitive impairment later in life.\n\n\u201cIt makes logical sense that kids, during a time of rapid brain development, should not be exposed to hit after hit after hit to their head,\u201d Stern said. \u201cTo me, it is logical. The brain is our most important organ. The idea of dropping kids off at a field during a very important period of maturation and fostering hit after hit after hit, it doesn\u2019t make sense to me personally.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s been a steadily mounting pile of research revealing the risks football puts today\u2019s youth in, and the lackluster future the professional players must live with for the rest of their lives. Looking ahead toward more unconventional treatment approaches, there have been proven benefits in marijuana\u2019s ability to decrease the brain\u2019s swelling from on-field impact.\n\nBrain injuries have become such a profoundly life-threatening part of a football player\u2019s life that the NFL and NFL Players Association announced in the fall it would revisit the substance abuse and performance-enhancing drugs policies. New testing will be performed, and it's expected there will be a revision of how violations will be handled, especially with regard to marijuana\u2019s medicinal use. Still, that\u2019s only a treatment option; what about preventive care for players before they\u2019re forced to search for solace in a bong rip?\n\nSource: Stern RA, Stamm JM, Bourlas AP, Baugh CM, Fritts NG, and Daneshvar DH.
