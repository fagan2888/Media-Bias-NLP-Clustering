A Denmark terrorist attack survivor was corrected on air during an interview when she said she was against Sharia law or those who would kill over spiritual differences of opinion.

During an interview with the U.K.’s Channel 4 News on Feb. 15, Polish artist Agnieszka Kolek said “I stand on the side of people that believe in the rule of law, the rule of law in a democratic country. I don’t stand on the side of Shariah law and people that use blasphemy law in Europe where anyone indiscriminately can go out and shoot at people,” the Blaze reported Wednesday.

Ms. Kolek’s comment prompted the news anchor to say “Sorry to interrupt you. We don’t know — we don’t know the details about the gunman as yet.”

The terror victim then went on to say that she heard the attacker screaming “Allahu Akbar!” as a bartender tried to use his body to shield a woman from gunfire.

Omar Abdel Hamid El-Hussein died during a shootout with Danish policemen Feb. 15. The 22-year-old gunman killed a filmmaker at the Krudttoenden cafe during an event featuring artist Lars Vilks. He then went to a synagogue and killed a security guard. Five police officers were wounded during their attempt to make an arrest.
