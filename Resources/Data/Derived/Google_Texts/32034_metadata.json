Brandet later confirmed to Reuters that the suicide belt was fake.\n\nFrance has been on high alert ever since the shootings last January at the Charlie Hebdo office and at a Jewish supermarket in which 17 people died over three days.\n\nSecurity concerns were further heightened in November, when 130 people were killed in the capital in coordinated shootings and suicide bombings that targeted a music hall, bars and restaurants and a soccer stadium.\n\nIslamic State, the militant group that controls swathes of Iraq and Syria, claimed responsibility for the Nov. 13 attacks. Several of the militants involved in those attacks were, like last January's killers, French-born.\n\nIn Thursday's incident, the man tried to force his way into the police station in the 18th district in northern Paris, an area that Islamic State said it had been planning to hit as part of the November attacks.\n\nWIRES PROTRUDING\n\n\"According to our colleagues, he wanted to blow himself up,\" an official at the Alternative Police union said. \"He shouted Allahu Akbar and had wires protruding from his clothes. That's why the police officer opened fire.\"\n\nOfficials said bomb disposal experts were on site.\n\nJournalist Anna Polonyi, who could see the outside of the police station from the window of her flat, posted photos on social media that showed what appeared to be a bomb-disposal robot beside the body.\n\nShe told Reuters that her sister, in the flat with her, had seen the incident happen. She said the police shouted at the man and that he then started running towards them before they shot him.\n\nLast year's attacks have boosted the popularity of the far-right National Front party ahead of a presidential election due in 2017.\n\nIn his speech, Hollande promised to better equip police to prevent further militant attacks.\n\nThe president also defended draconian security measures implemented since November that his Socialist government had once shunned.\n\n\"Terrorism has not stopped posing a threat to our country,\" Hollande said, repeating a promise to boost police recruitment and resources.\n\nSince the November attacks, Paris has increased its efforts at striking jihadist groups in Syria and Iraq, becoming the second largest contributor to the U.S.-led coalition against Islamic State.\n\nSecurity measures at home have included a three-month state of emergency during which the police have launched hundreds of raids on homes, mosques, restaurants and hotels.\n\n(Additional reporting by James Regan, Sophie Louet and Johnny Cotton; Editing by Andrew Callus and Gareth Jones)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "PARIS (Reuters) - Paris police shot dead on Thursday a man wielding a knife after he t", "title": "Paris police shoot dead knife-wielding man on Charlie Hebdo anniversary", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/01/07/Paris-police-shoot-dead-knife-wielding-man-Charlie-Hebdo-anniversary", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/france-shooting_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/01/07/Paris-police-shoot-dead-knife-wielding-man-Charlie-Hebdo-anniversary", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/france-shooting_1.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "PARIS (Reuters) - Paris police shot dead on Thursday a man wielding a knife after he t", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "\"The man may have been wearing something that could be a suicide belt,\" Interior Ministry spokesman Pierre-Henry Brandet told BFM TV.\nSince the November attacks, Paris has increased its efforts at striking jihadist groups in Syria and Iraq, becoming the second largest contributor to the U.S.-led coalition against Islamic State.\nIn his speech, Hollande promised to better equip police to prevent further militant attacks.\nIslamic State, the militant group that controls swathes of Iraq and Syria, claimed responsibility for the Nov. 13 attacks.\nShe said the police shouted at the man and that he then started running towards them before they shot him."}
