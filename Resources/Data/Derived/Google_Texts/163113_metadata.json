Tonight, he\u2019s expected to propose a plan to tax the rich and banks more, and distribute the proceeds to those on the lower rungs of the income ladder through tax credits. But he still won\u2019t do much to address a glaring tax loophole that exists only to help the rich get richer.\n\nObama\u2019s faith in progressive taxation\u2014hyped to a large degree by critics over the years\u2014has of course always been apparent. Obamacare included extra Medicare taxes on the wealthy, the proceeds of which are being used to subsidize health care for the poor and middle-class.\n\nAdditionally, the denouement of the fiscal cliff at the end of 2012 wound up partially reversing the Bush-era tax cuts, taking the top rate on income from 35 percent to 39.2 percent, and the top rate on long-term capital gains from 15 to 20 percent. (Since Obamacare adds an additional 3.4 percent tax on capital gains for highest earners, the top rate for long-term capital gains is now 23.4 percent.)\n\nBut considering the rampant income inequality and the vast distortions in the tax code enacted in favor of the wealthy in the aughts\u2014and the fact that mere inaction would have eliminated all of them\u2014those fixes were remarkably mild.\n\n\n\nThe same might be said about the proposal released over the weekend, which Obama will likely formally introduce in his State of the Union tonight. A year after the American publication of Thomas Piketty\u2019s Capital, the runaway bestseller about the ways in which the world\u2019s wealthy have become ever more wealthy over the decades, the leader of the party of FDR and Lyndon Johnson has finally picked up a pitchfork. But its tines still aren\u2019t very sharp.\n\nOne component of the proposal is specifically aimed at one of the ways Mitt Romney made his fortune. President Obama is proposing to cap at $3.4 million the amount of wealth that can be shielded on a tax-advantaged basis in Individual Retirement Accounts. By dint of some excellent tax advice and the willingness to drive a truck through a loophole, Romney was able to stash more than $100 million in his.\n\nBut capping IRA amounts does little to address the way Romney really made his money\u2014and that represents one of the most egregious, income-inequality-inducing wrinkles in our tax code. It\u2019s the factor that has really allowed hedge-fund titans and private-equity barons to routinely mint Rockefeller-size fortunes.\n\nIt\u2019s called the carried interest rule, and Obama doesn\u2019t look like he\u2019s ready to do away with it yet.\n\nPeople in the private-equity and hedge-fund world get paid to manage the money of other people and institutions\u2014typically a flat fee (about 2 percent) on the amount of money they manage and place at risk, plus a chunk of the profits those investments return (typically about 20 percent.)\n\nTake $100 million from investors, invest it in stocks, apply some leverage, and rack up a 30 percent return in a good year, or $30 million in total profits. Return $24 million to investors, and keep $6 million for yourself as payment for managing the money.\n\nBut here\u2019s the wrinkle. The IRS doesn\u2019t regard those payments as wage income\u2014as, say, a mutual-fund manager might charge for managing money, or as a lawyer or accountant might charge for providing advice. Rather, it regards it as capital gains\u2014even though the hedge-fund and private-equity managers aren\u2019t investing their own money.\n\nThat makes all the difference in the world. Under the current system, ordinary income can be taxed at rate as high as 39.6 percent. By contrast, long-term capital gains are taxed at 23.4 percent. That\u2019s a 40 percent difference. Thanks to the carried interest rule, a private-equity manager pays taxes of only $2.34 million on a $10 million performance fee; were it taxed as ordinary income, he\u2019d pay $3.96 million in taxes on that same sum.\n\nThere\u2019s no serious defense of this special treatment. Capital gains tend to be taxed more lightly than ordinary income because the government wants to provide incentives for people to put investment capital at risk. They could, after all, lose everything.\n\nBut private-equity and hedge-fund managers aren\u2019t putting their own money at risk; they\u2019re largely putting other people\u2019s money at risk. Because a sharp gap opened in the Bush years between the tax rates on capital gains and on ordinary income, this difference became hugely lucrative.\n\nIn classifying carried interest as capital gains, the tax code, which already privileges income earned by capital over income earned by labor, privileges the type of labor conducted by a very small fraction of the wealthiest over the labor of the rest of us.\n\nGet The Beast In Your Inbox!

But doing so without touching the carried interest rule still leaves a gaping hole between the top capital gains rate and the top income tax rate.\n\nThis isn\u2019t entirely surprising. Over the years, Obama has made occasional gestures toward eliminating the preference. But there isn\u2019t that much of an appetite among congressional Democrats for such a move. Even in 2009, when the Democratic Party, flush from victory and sitting on solid majorities in both houses of Congress, didn\u2019t attempt to eliminate the loophole.\n\nThe likely reason? Democrats\u2014especially the core group of senators from coastal states like New Jersey, Connecticut, New York, California, and Massachusetts\u2014tend to represent remarkably wealthy constituencies. Also, hedge fund, private equity, and venture capital honchos have been among the most prolific donors to the party apparatus, and to independent expenditure campaigns (see under: Soros, George; and Steyer, Tom).", "article_metadata": {"twitter": {"site": "@thedailybeast", "card": "summary"}, "keywords": "u.s. poli", "publicationDate": 201501201045, "wrap": "/content/dailybeast/politics", "description": "The president finally takes a big stand against wealth inequality tonight, but he still won\u2019t touch the tax loophole that benefits some of his biggest donors.", "pageNum": 1, "title": "Obamas Half-Assed Tax Hike Populism", "tags": "topic:politics", "environment": "dev", "platform": "desktop", "template": "article", "type": "house", "parsely-page": "{\"title\":\"Obama\u2019s Half-Assed Tax Hike Populism\",\"link\":\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/01/20/obama-s-half-assed-tax-hike-populism.html\",\"image_url\":\"http://cdn.thedailybeast.com/content/dailybeast/articles/2015/01/20/obama-s-half-assed-tax-hike-populism/jcr:content/image.crop.410.273.jpg/47393603.cached.jpg\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":\"/content/dailybeast/articles/2015/01/20/obama-s-half-assed-tax-hike-populism\",\"pub_date\":\"2015-01-20T10:45:00+00:00\",\"section\":\"Politics\",\"author\":\"Daniel Gross\",\"tags\":[\"politics\"]}", "news_keywords": "US Politics", "sectionTaxanomies": "politics", "fb": {"admins": "1703087,30000737,1117577220,1276800108,931159,514915512", "app_id": 189930913679}, "authors": "Daniel Gross", "article": {"section": "politics", "published_time": "2015-01-20T10:45:00.000Z", "author": "http://www.thedailybeast.com/contributors/daniel-grosshtml"}, "resourceType": "dailybeast2/components/pages/article", "contentpath": "/content/dailybeast/articles/2015/01/20/obama-s-half-assed-tax-hike-populism", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Beast", "description": "The president finally takes a big stand against wealth inequality tonight, but he still won\u2019t touch the tax loophole that benefits some of his biggest donors.", "title": "Obama\u2019s Half-Assed Tax Hike Populism", "url": "http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/01/20/obama-s-half-assed-tax-hike-populism.html", "image": "http://cdn.thedailybeast.com/content/dailybeast/articles/2015/01/20/obama-s-half-assed-tax-hike-populism/jcr:content/image.img.2000.jpg/1421808108936.cached.jpg", "type": "article"}, "authorIds": "/etc/authors/d/daniel-gross", "content-type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8"}, "article_summary": "(Since Obamacare adds an additional 3.4 percent tax on capital gains for highest earners, the top rate for long-term capital gains is now 23.4 percent.)\nBut doing so without touching the carried interest rule still leaves a gaping hole between the top capital gains rate and the top income tax rate.\nBecause a sharp gap opened in the Bush years between the tax rates on capital gains and on ordinary income, this difference became hugely lucrative.\nBy contrast, long-term capital gains are taxed at 23.4 percent.\nWe will not share your email with anyone for any reasonNow, Obama\u2019s proposal would help narrow that divide\u2014a little bit: He\u2019s proposing to raise the top tax on capital gains from 23.4 percent to 28 percent."}
