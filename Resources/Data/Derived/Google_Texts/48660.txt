Re:“Bans on e-cigs are premature,” July 28 editorial.

We respectfully disagree with the Denver Post position that community e-cigarette bans are premature. With so little known about the health effects of unregulated e-cigarettes, we commend communities that want to exercise caution in protecting the health of their citizens.

Recent research disputes the tobacco industry’s claim that the volatile compounds coming from e-cigarettes are harmless and instead confirms that cancer-causing chemicals are found in e-cigarette aerosol. We know that these products contain nicotine, a highly addictive substance that has been found in the environment around those smoking e-cigarettes, according to a recent study.

Another new, peer-reviewed research study shows that among young adult smokers, seeing someone use an e-cigarette triggers a desire to smoke. We are concerned that decades of effort in fighting tobacco addiction could be undermined by a new product that encourages young people to get addicted to nicotine, leads them to try other tobacco industry products, and increases the public places where smoking is accepted.

Since the passage of the Colorado Clean Indoor Air Act eight years ago, Coloradans have come to expect clean air in their public gathering places. We have seen a significant drop in the use of tobacco products and saved thousands of lives. Our citizens support Gov. John Hickenlooper’s vision of making Colorado the healthiest state in the nation.

Several communities have decided that e-cigarettes are a risk they don’t want to take. We support their decisions.
