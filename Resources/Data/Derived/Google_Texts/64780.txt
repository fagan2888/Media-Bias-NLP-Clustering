The fundraising site, www.gofundme.com/av7myk showed over $6,000 had been raised as of Friday. The goal was to raise $10,000 and the site was set up by Michele Franzoso, according to information on gofundme.com

Geoghegan, a part-time Island Heights police officer, was struck broadside after another vehicle ran a stop sign at Oak Hill and Larch Drive in Toms River. His jeep overturned from the impact.

Geoghegan, who has no medical insurance, was taken to Jersey Shore University Medical Center in Neptune. Fundraiser organizers said he suffered multiple life-threatening injuries that will keep him in a wheelchair for three to six months.

The fundraiser is needed to defray Geoghegan's medical bills.

Geoghegan is a volunteer firefighter with the Silverton Fire Company and a volunteer Emergency Medical Technician (EMT) on Silverton Emergency Medical Services.

He has served for Seaside Heights Police Department, but currently works part time for Island Heights Police Department and as an Emergency Medical Technician for Tri-Boro First Aid Squad in Seaside Park.

A fundraiser is being planned for 6 p.m. Sept. 19 at the Silverton Fire Department.
