Look at the geographic locations of no-shows. More often than not, distance from the clinic or practice has a bearing on whether a patient will show up for an appointment, Graf said during a session on telehealth trends at the American Telemedicine Association annual conference in Minneapolis.\n\nTelemedicine can solve two problems there, Graf said. Obviously, it can be a viable option to cut down on travel for patients in outlying areas, thus reducing the chance of no-shows. Plus, when there are no-shows, physicians can use the downtime to be on call for remote, virtual visits.\n\nIn other words, telemedicine, if done right, increases capacity rather than overwhelming physicians who might already be stretched to their limits of workload tolerance.\n\nDuring the same panel discussion, Dan McCafferty, vice president of global sales and corporate development at AMD Global Telemedicine in Chelmsford, Massachusetts, said that he has heard similar since passage of the Affordable Care Act in 2010. \u201cIt\u2019s great that people will have health insurance, but we don\u2019t have the capacity to take care of them,\u201d McCafferty said, repeating a common reason why healthcare organizations come to AMD for service.\n\nThose people clearly get it.\n\nPhoto: Flickr user V\u00e9ronique Debord-Lazaro", "article_metadata": {"description": "Telemedicine can actually solve the problems that some reluctant clinicians cite as excuses, according to speakers at ATA 2016.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "MedCity News", "description": "Telemedicine can actually solve the problems that some reluctant clinicians cite as excuses, according to speakers at ATA 2016.", "title": "How to tell when someone doesn\u2019t \u2018get\u2019 telemedicine", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://medcitynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/4932655275_9af8d4e8b6_z.jpg", "url": "http://medcitynews.com/2016/05/doesnt-get-telemedicine/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://medcitynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/4932655275_9af8d4e8b6_z.jpg", "creator": "@nversel", "description": "Telemedicine can actually solve the problems that some reluctant clinicians cite as excuses, according to speakers at ATA 2016.", "card": "summary", "title": "How to tell when someone doesn't 'get' telemedicine"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 148725768475669}, "google-site-verification": "xudQg7nxVR9ifmMTY4Tf-0wVtX9b6rWLQd0utCweGOc", "keywords": "weight loss, obesity, overweight,diabetes,massachusetts,medical devices,obesity,startups,healthcare innovation, medcity news,medcity news,san francisco, startups, life sciences,accelerator,rock health,startup advice,startup funding,patient monitoring system, motion sensors ,dc,healthcare it,washington,foodborne pathogens, diagnostics company, diagnostic platforms,minimally invasive surgery, laser surgery,cambridge,dealflow,hospitals,wellpoint, healthways, health and wellness, employee wellness programs,investing,wellness,medtronic, shanghai innovation center, china, r&d,china,mdt,minneapolis,minnesota,publics,twin cities,ulcerative colitis, abbott labs, humira,abbott labs,doctors,pharmaceuticals,skin disorders, pharmaceuticals, md anderson cancer center,cancer,texas,renal denervation, st. jude medical,st. jude medical,stj,emr, ehr, electronic health records, electronic medical records, certified emr,certified emr,ehr,electronic health records,electronic medical records,advanced cellular technology,amyotrophic lateral sclerosis,embryonic stem cells,geron corporation,lou gehrig\\'s disease,macular degeneration,regenerative medicine,spinal cord damage,value-based healthcare system, obamacare, fee-for-service model,california,cleveland,health insurance,insurance,ohio,pennsylvania,politics,cancer treatment options library, aetna, aet, healthcare it,aet,aetna,health it,phi,philadelphia,American Telemedicine Association, ata conference, events, Minneapolis, Minnesota, Telemedicine, , MedCity News", "article": {"section": "Daily", "tag": "Telemedicine", "published_time": "2016-05-17T16:52:48-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,width=device-width,user-scalable=no,minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Plus, when there are no-shows, physicians can use the downtime to be on call for remote, virtual visits.\nHow do you know when someone doesn\u2019t fully understand what telemedicine is all about?\nIn other words, telemedicine, if done right, increases capacity rather than overwhelming physicians who might already be stretched to their limits of workload tolerance.\nObviously, it can be a viable option to cut down on travel for patients in outlying areas, thus reducing the chance of no-shows.\nTelemedicine can solve two problems there, Graf said."}
