On Tuesday night, Democrats and Obama watched their Senate slip away from their hands and go to the Republicans, who now control both the Senate and the House of Representatives.

Ted Cruz took to the podium to praise and rejoice over the new power change, citing that the “era of Obama lawlessness is over.”

Cruz hit on several conservative hot topics, calling for the repeal of Obamacare, stopping the amnesty of millions of illegals, and enacting tax reform and regulatory reform.

He continued by saying that now is the time to protect the Second Amendment and our rights to bear arms, as well as protect the Tenth Amendment and repeal Common Core.

Cruz concluded by saying that, “now is the time for Republicans to come together in unity and stand as one, stand for principle and to say, we will honor the trust you have placed in us.”

After Obama made his speech after the midterm elections, he said that he is willing to start to work together with Congress to “get stuff done.”
