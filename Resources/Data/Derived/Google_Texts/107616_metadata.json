Well, if they\u2019re fathers, they want a drink and a hammock on their special day. Anything else is for these magazines to examine.\n\nOnly Esquire seems to care about Father\u2019s Day in our review of this month\u2019s men\u2019s magazines. But care it does. \u201cFATHERHOOD\u201d jumps off the cover , just below a photo of Mark Wahlberg with one of four kids on his shoulder. This sets up a script-perfect cover story about being a Hollywood dad. Marky Mark, all grown up, tossing a ball with his sons, taking his first-born back to Boston to meet his since-deceased dad \u2026 It\u2019s all there. But so is Wahlberg\u2019s not-so-pretty formula for work-life balance: to bed after dinner at 6:45 p.m., up to exercise at 1:30 a.m., then, after we mere mortals awake, out of the house to take the kids to school. The mag gets more serious about the subject in \u201cManifesto of the New Fatherhood,\u201d a well-researched piece by Stephen Marche that asserts \u201cfatherlessness is a national disaster.\u201d The issue even serves up insights from Robert DeNiro, including this bit we want our kids to read: \u201cI wish I had done so many things with my father. DeNiro admits, however, he did not wish that as a kid. And now, he says, his own brood brushes him off the same way.\n\nOkay, so Men\u2019s Journal doesn\u2019t officially address Father\u2019s Day. But it features three father-like figures \u2014 most notably Peter Matthiessen. In an interview subtitled \u201cA Final Visit with one of America\u2019s Greatest Writers,\u201d author Mark Adams sorts out Matthiessen\u2019s many lives: literary icon, nature writer, CIA operative, Zen Buddhist, East End fixture and WASP aristocrat-turned-juvenile delinquent. John Lucas, the \u201cgo-to guru\u201d for pro athletes with pot problems or worse, also makes an appearance. Once an All-American in tennis and basketball, Lucas knows about what he now treats. The former NBA star, Men\u2019s Journal reports, \u201clost the prime of his career to six years of cocaine and alcohol abuse.\u201d The magazine literally gives \u201cThe Last Word\u201d to Stan Lee in a transparent play to Daddy-deprived fanboys. \u201cHow should a man handle growing older?\u201d it asks the august animator, who earlier in the piece says that, with The Fantastic Four, he re-invented comics.\n\nIf the audience for Details gives a hoot about Father\u2019s Day, you\u2019d never know it looking at the current issue. The theme, if any, is life after 15 minutes of fame. America houseguest Kato Kaelin re-appears in a Q&A in which, as a proud homeowner, he parades his previously closeted humorous side. \u201cTwo bedrooms, three baths,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd did I tell you I live behind it?\u201d Another Q&A is devoted to Natasha (Don\u2019t Call it a Comeback) Lyonne, who characterizes comments about her previous life in the tabs and her character on \u201cOrange is the New Black\u201d as \u201ca little bit redundant.\u201d A look at the Heene family provides a story of interest in which we thought we had no interest. This is the family whose youngest sibling, Falcon, captured our attention as \u201cBalloon Boy\u201d \u2014 the 6-year-old mistakenly (but purposely) presumed to be aboard a helium-filled flying saucer that \u201cunexpectedly\u201d took flight in Colorado. Now 11, Falcon fronts \u201cthe world\u2019s youngest metal band\u201d \u2014 another family enterprise masterminded by his dad, Richard.\n\nMaxim devotes half of this month\u2019s issue to its \u201cHot 100,\u201d leaving precious little space for other trivial pursuits. It also leaves us wondering what its staff does, given it doesn\u2019t even own up to who makes the \u201cHot 100.\u201d It says, \u201cYou voted, we counted,\u201d thereby distancing itself from the objectifying, quantifying exercise. The issue does devote a page to the new mile-high club, which introduces an airborne cottage industry (plane rentals) committed to increasing what only 4 percent have achieved yet 33 percent \u201cfantasize about.\u201d Yet another way, we suppose, of producing fathers.\n\nA New York profile of health-care startup Oscar is full of cute color about the company\u2019s ads, the Soho loft where it\u2019s headquartered and its \u201cartisanal\u201d tech-driven strategy. What is glaringly absent is any discussion about the fact that Oscar and its backers, who include Facebook seeder Peter Thiel, are specifically targeting young people \u2014 exactly the demographic that Obamacare needs to attract if it\u2019s going to afford covering Baby Boomers. Elsewhere, features on sleeplessness and a new opioid drug are equally mediocre. But we did enjoy the piece by Dan Kois, who chronicles the month he went without sitting down. \u201cMy calves weren\u2019t happy,\u201d Kois reports, in one of his few summations that aren\u2019t laced with expletives.\n\nMaking a case that Hillary Clinton could lose a 2016 presidential bid, Time\u2019s Joe Klein argues that her biggest vulnerability is that she\u2019s too \u201cpolitical\u201d \u2014 that, for example, being the word she used to describe her support for the Iraq invasion. \u201cShe\u2019s going to have to drop the veil,\u201d Klein contends. We wish there were a ring of truth to this, just like we wish former Montana governor Brian Schweitzer might have a chance running against her in the Democratic primary. The gun-toting populist isn\u2019t afraid to say that Obamacare sold out to the drug and insurance lobbies, and notes that Clinton has been courting Goldman Sachs. \u201cYou can\u2019t be a candidate that shakes down more money on Wall Street than anybody \u2026 and be a populist,\u201d Schweitzer says.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "New York Post", "twitter": {"description": "What do men really want?
