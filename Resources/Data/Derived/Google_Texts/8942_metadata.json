The latest is none other than Vice President Joseph R. Biden, who usually boasts about the lack of daylight between the president and himself.\n\nThe vice president let it be known last week that he was \u201cticked off\u201d about the way the president forced out Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel, a longtime Senate colleague of Mr. Biden\u2018s. Mr. Hagel was pushed out in less than two years by a White House that is accused of micromanaging national security policy.\n\nPHOTOS: See Obama's biggest White House fails\n\nEarlier this year, former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton criticized Mr. Obama\u2019s stated principle of foreign policy: \u201cDon\u2019t do stupid stuff.\u201d\n\n\u201cGreat nations need organizing principles, and \u2018Don\u2019t do stupid stuff\u2019 is not an organizing principle,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said in an interview.\n\nAn anonymous Clinton ally criticized Mr. Obama\u2019s handling of the Islamic State and other Middle Eastern crises this fall as too \u201cpassive,\u201d saying, Mrs. Clinton \u201cwould have taken a more aggressive approach.\u201d\n\nPHOTOS: Must see! The Expendables: Written, directed and produced by President Obama\n\nPresidents occasionally receive harsh reviews from former Cabinet members, but former Defense Secretaries Robert M. Gates and Leon E. Panetta both have issued broadsides against Mr. Obama in tell-all books.\n\nThe comments by Mr. Biden, a potential presidential candidate in 2016, and Mrs. Clinton, a likely candidate, illustrate the uncomfortable process of separating legacies from the unpopular president after Democrats took a thrashing in midterm elections.\n\n\u201cPresident Obama is at an all-time low in approval ratings,\u201d Republican strategist Ron Bonjean said. \u201cAmericans haven\u2019t seen the changes that he promised would happen, with our economy and national security. And so Democrats like Hillary Clinton and Joe Biden are going to run away from the president as fast as they can. They cannot run on President Obama\u2019s record because there isn\u2019t much success to go with it.\u201d\n\nNowhere was Mr. Obama\u2019s baggage spelled out so vividly as in a postelection survey by Democracy Corps, the Democratic polling firm run by Stan Greenberg and James Carville, former advisers to President Clinton.\n\nTheir Nov. 14 report said a majority of the public is dissatisfied with the economy and 47 percent of those surveyed don\u2019t believe it is improving.\n\n\u201cThe lack of progress on everyday economic experience leads many to question whether an economic recovery is actually even occurring,\u201d their memo said. \u201cWith the public aggrieved about the new economy and demanding big changes in direction, Democrats and progressives will only get heard when they join the economic debate with a very different voice.\u201d\n\nIn another report this month, Democracy Corps said Mr. Obama\u2019s campaign message on the economy was too timid.\n\n\u201cThe voters want to vote for change, and this poll shows that the Democrats and their supportive coalition would rally to a message that understands people are struggling with the new economy; but that was not president\u2019s economic narrative for this election and it showed,\u201d the pollsters said.\n\nTheir election night survey found that Mrs. Clinton would defeat Republican Mitt Romney in a hypothetical matchup by 6 percentage points. It noted that this margin doesn\u2019t reflect the projected growth of Democrat-leaning groups such as millennials and Hispanics in the 2016 electorate.\n\nWeeks after that report was released, Mrs. Clinton made a rare public statement of support for Mr. Obama\u2019s executive action to grant legal status and work permits to nearly 5 million illegal immigrants, a move long sought by Hispanic groups.\n\nOthers say it is dangerous for Mrs. Clinton to side with Mr. Obama\u2019s immigration policy. Douglas Schoen, a former pollster for Mr. Clinton, and Patrick Caddell, a former pollster for President Carter, said Mr. Obama\u2019s executive action was \u201cjust the latest thorn in the side\u201d of Mrs. Clinton.\n\n\u201cMrs. Clinton would likely inherit a damaged party \u2014 and as a former member of his administration, she would struggle with the consequences of Mr. Obama\u2019s go-it-alone governance,\u201d they wrote in The Wall Street Journal. They said only 43 percent of those polled in the midterms think Mrs. Clinton would make a good president, and she lost against a hypothetical generic Republican candidate by 40 percent to 34 percent.\n\nThey concluded that doubling down on Mr. Obama\u2019s policies would further hurt Mrs. Clinton.\n\nMr. Biden, whose political future seems more open to doubt, said in a speech just after the elections that the economy during the Obama administration has grown at a more rapid pace than nearly all of the 1990s \u2014 when the Clintons occupied the White House.\n\nMr. Obama said last week that he probably won\u2019t campaign much for the eventual Democratic presidential nominee because voters want \u201cthat new car smell.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey want to drive something off the lot that doesn\u2019t have as much mileage as me,\u201d Mr. Obama said, adding that probably would remain on the sidelines as the primary season heats up.\n\nJudging from the reactions of Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Biden, that won\u2019t be a problem.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Whether out of frustration or political necessity, some of President Obama's closest lieutenants from his first term are distancing themselves from Mr. Obama as 2016 approaches.", "Author": "Dave Boyer", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Whether out of frustration or political necessity, some of President Obama\u2019s closest lieutenants from his first term are distancing themselves from Mr. Obama as 2016 approaches.", "title": "Joe Biden, Hillary Clinton split from Obama as presidential campaign nears", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/nov/27/joe-biden-hillary-clinton-split-from-obama-as-pres/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/06/23/biden-1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/06/23/biden-1.jpg", "title": "Joe Biden, Hillary Clinton split from Obama as presidential campaign n", "description": "Whether out of frustration or political necessity, some of President Obama's closest lieutenants from his first term are distancing themselves from Mr. Obama as 2016 approaches.", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "news_keywords": "Politics, Hillary Rodham Clinton, Joseph R Biden, White House, Joe Biden"}, "article_summary": "Judging from the reactions of Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Biden, that won\u2019t be a problem.\nTheir election night survey found that Mrs. Clinton would defeat Republican Mitt Romney in a hypothetical matchup by 6 percentage points.\n\u201cPresident Obama is at an all-time low in approval ratings,\u201d Republican strategist Ron Bonjean said.\nOthers say it is dangerous for Mrs. Clinton to side with Mr. Obama\u2019s immigration policy.\nThey concluded that doubling down on Mr. Obama\u2019s policies would further hurt Mrs. Clinton."}
