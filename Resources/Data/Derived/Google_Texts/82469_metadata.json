More like frenemies.\n\nAnd on Thursday, their conflicting and schizophrenic relationship got more complicated.\n\nAfter three days of deliberations, a jury demanded that Samsung pay Apple $290 million for 13 patent infringements, bringing the total amount owed to the California-based company to $920 million.\n\nSamsung has taken the bigger beating in the dispute, despite overtaking Apple as the world\u2019s largest smart phone maker. For one, the electronics giant has received a measly 10 percent discount from the original $1.05 billion in damages owed to Apple.\n\nSamsung might have no choice but to suck up the ruling. \u201cThe fine represents an expense that Samsung understands may be necessary to continue to sell in the US market,\u201d said Jasper Kim, a law professor at Ewha Womens\u2019 University in Seoul. If Samsung appeals, it could also have a hard time arguing its case. Two separate juries have now ruled that patent infringements did substantial damage to Apple.\n\nSamsung won\u2019t have to struggle to find the money. The company has a $39 billion cash hoard. In the third quarter of 2013 it raked in an astounding $9.56 billion profit.\n\nYet the ruling wounds corporate pride. For years, Samsung has been trying to shed its image as a \u201cfast follower.\u201d It has yet to create a game-changer like the Apple iPhone or Sony Walkman; Its recent smart watch appears to be a colossal flop. The notion that its fortunes depend on pilfered Apple technology no doubt bristles.\n\nApple, of course, was happy with the ruling, regardless of whether it\u2019ll receive a slightly smaller payoff from Samsung. \u201cFor Apple, this case has always been about more than patents and money. It has been about innovation and the hard work that goes into inventing products that people love,\u201d the company said in a statement. \u201cWhile it's impossible to put a price tag on those values, we are grateful to the jury for showing Samsung that copying has a cost.\"\n\nSo Apple has declared victory. Now for the hard part: dealing with the awkward reality that Samsung is a major supplier of chipsets and parts for the iPhone and iPad.\n\nThe Samsung Group \u2014 the name for the more than 80 Samsung affiliates in shipbuilding, semiconductors and even life insurance \u2014 has one major piece of leverage over the global supply chain: its octopus-like reach into just about every pivotal tech industry you can imagine.\n\nBecause of this, these two adversaries have a history of fighting and kissing. Apple, in fact, depends on the Korean company\u2019s high-tech manufacturing prowess for billions of dollars worth of components in the iPhone and other gadgets.\n\n\u201cI don't see the ruling as changing the Apple-Samsung complex dynamic,\u201d Kim said. \u201cIt certainly won't help to warm relations between these two fierce rivals.\u201d\n\nRivals, maybe. But the two companies have had a more complex relationship since the advent of the personal computer.\n\nIt all began in 1983, when Steve Jobs first visited the Samsung Electronics campus in Suwon, South Korea.\n\nThe 28-year-old whiz kid presented the Apple computer to Samsung founder Lee Byung-chul.\n\nThe early Apple-Samsung meeting didn\u2019t produce immediate results. In the 1980s, the Korean company was known for making cheap, third-rate microwaves and dishwashers, rather than the sleek Galaxy products of today. But Lee was making his first forays into the high-tech future, investing in semiconductor manufacturing.\n\nIt took time for Samsung\u2019s tech investments to bear fruit, but by the 2000s, the company had significant stakes in the holy trifecta of growth: flash memory, mobile phone batteries, and LCD displays. In 2005, the quality of flash memory products \u2014 along with Samsung\u2019s financial stability \u2014 caught the attention of Jobs, who was looking for a flash memory supplier for his gadgets.\n\nThat year, Samsung heir apparent Jay Y. Lee, the grandson of deceased founder Lee Byung-chul, even visited Jobs at his home in Cupertino, Calif. The duo forged an amiable business relationship that lasted until Jobs\u2019 death, one former Samsung executive told GlobalPost on a condition of anonymity. Lee was the only Asian industry executive to attend Jobs\u2019 memorial service in 2011.\n\nBefore the iPhone-Galaxy rivalry, Apple placed a great deal of trust in Samsung. The Korean company began supplying NAND flash memory to Apple, a coveted and strategic position in the electronics industry.\n\nBut that\u2019s where things got complicated. Analysts say Samsung\u2019s massive position as an industry supplier may have given it a road map for what Apple \u2014 along with other competitors \u2014 thought about the future of the mobile arena. Samsung denies this; The official company line is that its semiconductor and consumer electronics businesses remain separate.\n\nAfter Apple filed its patent infringement lawsuit over the Galaxy line in early 2011, many wondered whether Apple would seek to diminish its dependence on Samsung.\n\nSo far it hasn\u2019t, possibly because of difficulties finding suppliers who could match Samsung\u2019s quality, stability and delivery speed. Samsung continues to be the world\u2019s largest NAND maker, dominating just under 40 percent of the NAND flash memory market.\n\nStill, it\u2019s possible that Apple is coming close to finding a way out. In October, a report suggested that Apple was turning to New York-based chipmaker GlobalFoundries. Analysts also wonder if Toshiba \u2014 the Japanese company that first thought up NAND technology \u2014 could take Samsung\u2019s place, given its plans to build a large flash memory factory.\n\nSamsung, on the other hand, may have a sound counter-strategy. The company could be using acquisitions to strengthen its hold on the supply chain. In October, the company became the largest shareholder in American glassmaker Corning, which makes the glass for the iPhone cover and just about every other big competitor.\n\nThe California legal battle may be over for now.\n\nBut with Samsung\u2019s tentacle-like reach, a long and difficult game of chess is being waged \u2014 one that could easily complicate the relationship even more in the future.", "article_metadata": {"layout": "Content Default", "description": "Since 2011, two titans of the electronics industry \u2014 Samsung Electronics and Apple \u2014 have been locked in legal warfare over their smart phones and...", "title": "Apple vs. Samsung: Tech's Best Frenemies | Courts have granted Apple more than $900 million over technology pilfered by Samsung.
