Scott Applewhite Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-NY)\n\nSen. Chuck Schumer (D-NY) made waves during his speech at the National Press Club in Washington DC this week, when he expressed that passing health care reform had been the wrong move for Democrats because it did not help middle-class Americans. The remarks come as a surprise not only because Schumer was one of the Affordable Care Act\u2019s biggest proponents during the legislative effort to pass the bill, but also because they seem to contradict the situation on the ground in Schumer\u2019s own state.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, Democrats blew the opportunity the American people gave them,\u201d Schumer said in his speech \u201cWe took their mandate and put all of our focus on the wrong problem \u2013 health care reform.\u201d The senator went on to say that only about a third of the previously uninsured population are registered to vote, and that focusing on benefiting such a small percentage of the electorate was a political miscalculation. \u201cWhen Democrats focused on health care, the average middle-class person thought, \u2018The Democrats aren\u2019t paying enough attention to me,\u2019\u201d he continued.\n\nSchumer\u2019s notion that Obamacare only benefits those in the lower end of the economic spectrum is a flawed one. It is also in direct conflict with the Chuck Schumer of 2010, who campaigned incessantly for health care reform, and insisted that the policy \u201creally did deliver for the middle-class.\u201d\n\nIt is true that most of the people who were uninsured were poor, and therefore the new law\u2019s main beneficiaries tended to be lower income. But to make the argument, as Schumer did, that middle-class Americans saw no benefits from Obamacare ignores some key aspects of the law\n\nMiddle-income Americans benefitted from tax credits and health care subsidies. The also benefited from parts of the law that secured insurance for people with pre-existing conditions, and allowed young people to stay on their parents insurance until the age of 26.\n\nPerhaps the most significant way in which Obamacare has helped middle-class Americans is the effect that it has had on the cost of health insurance. In New York \u2014 Schumer\u2019s home state \u2014 the previously unchecked rise in premiums has been slowing overall ever since the law was enacted, with many people actually enjoying a significant drop in price. New Yorkers enrolled in the state\u2019s health care exchange pay as much as 50 percent less than they had for policies in the individual health care market.\n\n\u201c[Health Care] costs do go up and you would expect premiums to go up to offset those costs,\u201d Blair Horner of the New York Public Interest Research Group told the New York Daily News. \u201cI think the Affordable Care Act experiment continues, but the initial diagnosis is a good one.\u201d\n\nRegardless of Schumer\u2019s belief that health care reform was a political miscalculation, it has benefited his middle-class constituents, as well as his lower-income ones.\n\nJoaquim Moreira Salles is an intern at ThinkProgress.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "Sen.
