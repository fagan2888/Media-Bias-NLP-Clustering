That shrank from 17.1 percent at the end of last year to 15.6 percent for the first three months of 2014.\n\nThe decline of 1.5 percentage points would translate roughly to more than 3.5 million people gaining coverage. The trend accelerated as the March 31 enrollment deadline loomed.\n\n\u201cThe Affordable Care Act, commonly referred to as \u2018Obamacare,\u2019 appears to be accomplishing its goal of increasing the percentage of Americans with health insurance,\u201d said Gallup\u2019s analysis of the findings.\n\nThe survey is important because it combines the quick turnaround of media polls with extensive outreach usually seen in government research. Gallup interviewed more than 43,500 adults, or more than 40 times the number in a typical national media poll.\n\nComing a week after the close of the health care law\u2019s first enrollment season, Gallup\u2019s numbers suggest a more modest impact on coverage than statistics cited by the Obama administration.\n\nThe administration says 7.1 million have signed up for subsidized private plans through new insurance markets, while 3 million previously uninsured people gained coverage through the law\u2019s Medicaid expansion. Millions more remain potentially eligible for marketplace coverage under various extensions the administration has issued.\n\nHowever, those numbers are not comparable with Gallup\u2019s.\n\nThe White House figure of 7.1 million insurance exchange sign-ups includes insured people who switched their previous coverage, as well as people who have not paid their first month\u2019s premium, and who would therefore still be uninsured.\n\nAlso, Gallup is counting just adults, while the administration figures include children as well.\n\nIt may take much of the rest of the year to get a true bottom line of the health care law\u2019s impact on coverage.\n\nBut Gallup\u2019s numbers do show an improving trend. The share of Americans without coverage is at its lowest since late 2008, before Obama took office, the survey found.\n\nThat\u2019s independent validation for the White House, and it also helps calm concerns about the fallout from last fall\u2019s wave of insurance cancellations.\n\nSome feared the cancellations of more than 4.7 million policies that didn\u2019t measure up to the law\u2019s standards would actually swell the ranks of uninsured people. That created huge political problems for Obama, who had promised Americans they could keep their insurance if they liked it.\n\nAbout half the states authorized extensions belatedly granted by the White House.\n\nGallup found the biggest insurance gains were among lower-income people and among African-Americans.\n\nAmong people with household incomes of less than $36,000 a year, the share of uninsured shrank by 3.2 percentage points from levels at the end of 2013.\n\nAfrican-Americans saw their uninsured rate drop by 3.3 percentage points.\n\nAlthough the proportion of Hispanics without coverage fell by 1.7 percentage points, Latinos remained more likely than any racial or ethnic group to lack access, with 37 percent uninsured.\n\nGallup found gains in coverage among all age groups, but not much evidence of a late surge of younger people that the administration had hoped for to help keep premiums in check.\n\nResults were based on telephone interviews conducted Jan. 2 -March 31 with a random sample of 43,562 adults 18 and older living in all 50 states and Washington, D.C. For results based on the total sample of national adults, the margin of sampling error is plus or minus 1 percentage point at the 95 percent confidence level.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.thumb": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.1748213.1396880579!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/usa-healthcare-technology.jpg", "description": "A major new survey finds that a growing percentage of Americans gained health insurance as the initial sign-up season for President Barack Obama\u2019s health care law drew to a close last month.
