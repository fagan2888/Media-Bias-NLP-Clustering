Lawrence has Hepatitis C and has struggled to afford the medication he needs to treat it. ( April Dembosky/KQED )\n\nSometimes Mikkel Lawrence gets up in the morning, eats breakfast, and then heads straight back to bed for a nap.\n\n\u201cI get really bad tired spells. It\u2019s like you have to go to sleep,\u201d he says.\n\nThis is one of the symptoms of Hepatitis C, a virus that damages the liver. Most people who have it don\u2019t have any symptoms, sometimes for decades. But for some people like Lawrence, waves of intense fatigue hit several times a day.\n\n\u201cIt takes away probably three or four hours of my waking day,\u201d he says.\n\nThere\u2019s also an increased risk of liver cancer or liver failure. So when Lawrence heard last year that there was a new drug regimen that could cure his disease, he went straight to his insurance company.\n\n\u201cThe first thing they did, of course, was deny it,\u201d he says.\n\nBut the real problem, once he did get approval, was the price tag. Each pill costs $1,000.\n\n\u201cThe first quote I got was $140,000, and I would be responsible for $14,000 of it,\u201d he remembers.\n\nLawrence is a retired middle school teacher. He lives on Social Security. There was just no way he could come up with $14,000 on his own.\n\n\u201cI went to everybody I knew of,\u201d he says, \u201cand fussed and fumed and all that stuff.\u201d\n\nEventually, Lawrence got financial aid from a nonprofit to help him cover his out-of-pocket costs. Every morning at 10 a.m., he stood over his bathroom sink and swallowed two capsules.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d go to take my pills and I\u2019d go, there\u2019s one thousand,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd there\u2019s another thousand.\u201d\n\nHealth advocates hear scenarios like this all the time from patients with a range of chronic conditions, including Hepatitis C, HIV, multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve heard stories of people who\u2019ve emptied their retirement savings to cover their drug needs,\u201d said Betsy Imholz, special projects director at Consumers Union, an advocacy group. \u201cIt\u2019s a really frightening, Wild West situation for people who need these specialty drugs.\u201d\n\nShe and other advocates took their concerns to Covered California, the agency that implements the Affordable Care Act in the state. Advocates argued there should be a limit on how much consumers have to pay for these drugs.\n\nThe agency agreed, and today the board will vote on a proposal that would cap the monthly out-of-pocket costs for specialty drugs. Under most plans, people would have to pay only $250 per prescription, per month. Some silver plans would have $150-caps, while bronze plans would have caps of $500.\n\nUPDATE: Covered California\u2019s board approved these caps at Thursday\u2019s meeting. Health plans must now incorporate them into their benefits for 2016.\n\n\u201cWe are putting California consumers first,\u201d said Peter Lee, Covered California\u2019s executive director. \u201cThese new policies strike a balance between ensuring Covered California consumers can afford the medication they need to treat chronic and life-threatening conditions while keeping premiums affordable for all.\u201d\n\nThis policy will apply only to the 2.2 million people who buy coverage on the individual market. A bill currently being considered in the state\u2019s Legislature would extend that protection to many people with employer-based plans as well.\n\nSeveral other states are also considering similar caps, some as low as $100.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re better than most,\u201d Imholz says, \u201cbut not the absolute top of the heap as we usually are.\u201d\n\nHealth insurance companies involved in Covered California meetings tried to negotiate for higher caps, closer to $500 for all plans, Imholz says. Still, she added, insurers did support the overall idea of caps.\n\nNicole Kasabian Evans of the California Association of Health Plans says insurers see a correlation between the cost of a drug and adherence \u2013 patients who can\u2019t afford what they\u2019re prescribed will sometimes split pills, or not take them at all.\n\n\u201cIf you ultimately have to go back and take a second round, because you didn\u2019t take it right the first time, or you never took it and you develop a more serious health condition, it\u2019s not good for the consumer, and it costs the health care system more money,\u201d she says.\n\nKasabian Evans says the real root of the problem lies with the pharmaceutical companies that set the drug prices. Last year, more than half a million patients in the U.S. had medication costs that exceeded $50,000, according to a recent report from Express Scripts, a company that manages prescription benefits\n\n\u201cThis is unsustainable,\u201d she says, \u201cand it\u2019s going to have a major impact on the price of health care.\u201d\n\nEven if insurers lower the co-pays for patients who take specialty drugs, the price the insurers pay stays the same. Eventually, they say the only way to balance the books will be to raise monthly premiums for everyone else.\n\n\u201cSo if we really want to make sure consumers can afford prescription drug coverage, then we need to deal with the root price of the drug,\u201d Kasabian Evans says.\n\nDrug companies routinely defend their drug prices, citing the lengthy and expensive process of developing new drugs, and the many failed attempts that often precede successes.\n\nThe debates aren\u2019t helping Mikkel Lawrence right now. His battle over Hepatitis C drugs continues. Turns out that $140,000 regimen he took last year didn\u2019t work. He fell into the 5 percent of patients who don\u2019t respond. But now he\u2019s caught wind of a new drug that\u2019s coming down the pipeline. And he\u2019s already drafting a series of emails and letters to get it approved and to find the money to pay for it.\n\n\u201cAs soon as they\u2019re out, I\u2019m taking them,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Agency to act as some patients' out-of-pocket costs for a regimen of drugs runs into thousands of dollars.", "contextly-page": "{\"title\":\"Covered California Considers Capping Patients' Drug Costs\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/2015\\/05\\/21\\/covered-california-considers-capping-patients-drug-costs\\/\",\"pub_date\":\"2015-05-21 00:07:19\",\"mod_date\":\"2015-05-21 18:46:15\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":28683,\"author_id\":\"3205\",\"author_name\":\"April Dembosky\",\"author_display_name\":\"April Dembosky\",\"tags\":[\"Covered California\"],\"categories\":[\"Obamacare\",\"Policy\"],\"image\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/sites\\/27\\/2015\\/05\\/5GFaW-e1432161034307.jpg\"}", "og": {"site_name": "State of Health", "description": "Agency to act as some patients' out-of-pocket costs for a regimen of drugs runs into thousands of dollars.", "title": "Covered California Considers Capping Patients\u2019 Drug Costs", "url": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/2015/05/21/covered-california-considers-capping-patients-drug-costs/", "image": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/wp-content/uploads/sites/27/2015/05/5GFaW-1440x958.jpg", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@kqedhealth", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@"}, "fb": {"app_id": 160023622793}, "keywords": "covered california", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0ab2\"", "article_summary": "\u201cWe are putting California consumers first,\u201d said Peter Lee, Covered California\u2019s executive director.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a really frightening, Wild West situation for people who need these specialty drugs.\u201dShe and other advocates took their concerns to Covered California, the agency that implements the Affordable Care Act in the state.\nHealth plans must now incorporate them into their benefits for 2016.\n\u201cThese new policies strike a balance between ensuring Covered California consumers can afford the medication they need to treat chronic and life-threatening conditions while keeping premiums affordable for all.\u201dThis policy will apply only to the 2.2 million people who buy coverage on the individual market.\nDrug companies routinely defend their drug prices, citing the lengthy and expensive process of developing new drugs, and the many failed attempts that often precede successes."}
