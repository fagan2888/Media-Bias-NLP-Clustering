Bush, Politics, Politics News\n\nWhen George W. Bush became president in 2001, it marked the first time in 70 years that conservative Republicans controlled all three branches of government. By the time Bush left office, we were all reminded why. The financial crisis and resulting global economic meltdown Bush left us with were eerily reminiscent of the Great Depression, but there was also 9/11, the Iraq War and Katrina\u2014a multifaceted record of spectacular failure so stunning that it should have disqualified conservative Republicans from holding power for at least another seven decades. Yet, the Democrats\u2019 political response to the many messes Bush left behind has been so spectacularly inept that they\u2019ve not only lost both houses of Congress, they\u2019ve also lost more state legislative seats than any time since before the Great Recession.\n\nThere are many ways one might explain this state of affairs\u2014and certainly the rise of Wall Street Democrats and the decline of labor played crucial roles. But beyond any particular issue area, there\u2019s also the matter of differences in how liberals and conservatives think\u2014and how they act and organize as a result.\n\nAs I\u2019ve written before, a growing body of literature reveals that liberals and conservatives think differently from one another in ways that can even be traced back, in part, to the level of instinctual response, reflecting conservatives\u2019 heightened sensitivity to threat bias. This work is congruent with an integrated multi-factor account offered by John Jost and three co-authors in the 2003 meta-analysis \u201cPolitical Conservatism as Motivated Social Cognition.\u201d In their abstract, they explained, \u201cAnalyzing political conservatism as motivated social cognition integrates theories of personality (authoritarianism, dogmatism\u2013intolerance of ambiguity), epistemic and existential needs (for closure, regulatory focus, terror management), and ideological rationalization (social dominance, system justification).\u201d Their meta-analysis integrated findings from 88 sample studies in 12 countries, with 22,818 individual subjects\u2014meaning it drew on a substantial body of work by others.\n\nYet, once publicized, it drew such a hostile response there was even talk of Congress defunding the entire field of research into political attitudes. In response, Jost and one co-author wrote a Washington Post Op-Ed, which defused the crisis. In it, they wrote:\n\nTrue, we find some support for the traditional \u201crigidity-of-the-right\u201d hypothesis, but it is also true that liberals could be characterized on the basis of our overall profile as relatively disorganized, indecisive and perhaps overly drawn to ambiguity \u2014 all of which may be liabilities in mass politics and other public and professional domains.\n\nThis statement underscores the point that liberal cognitive tendencies can be as problematic in their way as conservative ones are.\n\nThe multi-factor distinction Jost and his colleagues analyzed is roughly congruent with a broader distinction, discussed by Chris Mooney in\u201dThe Republican Brain\u201d (which I wrote about here), related to two of the \u201cBig Five\u201d personality traits\u2014conservatives score higher on conscientiousness, while liberals score higher on openness to new experience.\n\nAs these few examples suggest, there are multiple ways to characterize the differences in how liberals and conservatives think. For instance, Mooney argued that liberals, still fundamentally inspired by the Enlightenment promise of ever-growing knowledge about the world, are fundamentally mistaken about the nature of human reason, which they see as knowledge- and truth-seeking. But modern cognitive science teaches us that our brains are much more fundamentally shaped by the need to make persuasive arguments, which only require the appearance of rational argument.\n\nIn \u201cThe Battle for God,\u201d Karen Armstrong illuminates a slightly different, though related, difference, contrasting the modalities of mythos and logos. As Armstrong explains, logos is concerned with the practical understanding of how things work in the world, while mythos is concerned with ultimate meaning. Either modality can be used by liberals and conservatives alike in their everyday lives. But macro-historically, there\u2019s been a distinct bias\u2014and weird twist on top of it\u2014at least since the dawn of the modern era. That\u2019s when logos began becoming so all-pervasive that it seemed destined to dislodge mythos, and some defenders of mythos (now commonly known as fundamentalists) fought back paradoxically by assuming the framework of logos, and arguing that their mythos was literally true\u2014a move that true traditionalists would have found to be deeply in error, because it devalued the essential purpose of mythos.\n\nThe congruence with Mooney\u2019s argument is obvious: There\u2019s a clear kinship between logos and the Enlightenment model of reason on the one hand, and mythos and persuasion on the other. If conservatives under George W. Bush once again proved themselves incompetent in the logos of governing, liberals under Obama proved themselves incompetent in its mythos.\n\nOr so I hypothesized. But I wanted to check things out with perhaps the world\u2019s leading expert on incompetence, psychologist David Dunning, the senior researcher in the team that discovered the Dunning-Kruger effect, which Wikpedepia defines as \u201ca cognitive bias whereby unskilled individuals suffer from illusory superiority, mistakenly rating their ability much higher than is accurate.\u201d Wikipedia added that \u201cThis bias is attributed to a metacognitive inability of the unskilled to recognize their ineptitude.\u201d Or, as Dunning explained to Errol Morris, writing an essay series, \u201cThe Anosognosic\u2019s Dilemma: Something\u2019s Wrong but You\u2019ll Never Know What It Is,\u201d for the New York Times, \u201cIf you\u2019re incompetent, you can\u2019t know you\u2019re incompetent \u2026 [T]he skills you need to produce a right answer are exactly the skills you need to recognize what a right answer is.\u201d A recent article by Dunning, \u201cWe Are All Confident Idiots,\u201d provides both humorous and serious examples showing just how pervasive the problem is.\n\nLike many, I first learned of the Dunning-Kruger effect from that NYT series\u2014and made some observations based on it at the time. There are obvious conclusions one can draw from the Dunning-Kruger effect: perhaps most important, that none of those obvious conclusions will apply to your own shortcomings, even though those are the ones that ought to concern you most. But this is specifically an individual effect, and my observation was about groups\u2014and rather large ones, at that. So in reaching out to talk with Dunning, behind any specifics, I had two questions in mind: Could it apply to groups as well as individuals? And was it possible to do something about it?\n\nIn both cases, he answered yes, but some of the specifics surprised me. Which is just what I should have expected\u2014to discover some limits of my own understanding. (Dunning himself has referenced Donald Rumsfeld\u2019s phrase \u201cunknown unknowns\u201d to describe what we\u2019re up against, just by the very nature of being human. But don\u2019t have a cow, man. He\u2019s also referenced Socrates, as well.)\n\nTo begin with, I wanted to make sure we were on the same page. An example that came readily to mind was the GOP\u2019s claims to have 46 jobs bills that had passed the House, and were languishing in the Senate. If only Obama and Harry Reid would act on them! The reality, of course, is that these bills would not actually do very much in the way of job creation, as critics have pointed out repeatedly over the past several years. In late October, the New York Times even interviewed some top GOP economists who admitted as much, along with independent analysts who said it would be hard to measure much impact.\n\nIn short, the GOP \u201cjobs bills\u201d aren\u2019t seriously intended to create jobs. They\u2019re intended to create talking points about creating jobs \u2014 and to counter Democratic talking points (while also doing favors for GOP donors, of course). They reflect both the persuasive nature of human cognition highlighted by Chris Mooney, and the meaning-making function of mythos described by Karen Armstrong. They might not create many jobs, I noted early in my conversation with Dunning\u2014it\u2019s aggregate demand that\u2019s the primary driver in doing that\u2014but they do resonate with the \u201cjob creator\u201d mythos, which has been so prominent in conservative circles these past several years, and which makes perfect sense in the world of small businessmen I\u2019ve known.\n\nDunning thought it was an apt example. He noted that people are often perplexed over where a never-ending, chicken-and-egg cycle begins. \u201cYou have business people, they don\u2019t just decide there is going to be a market, they respond to the market, they respond to a demand,\u201d Dunning said. \u201cBut they start the process where they enter the picture \u2026 People tend to think of themselves sort of as creators who come in and are imposing their will and their desires on the environment, and sort of filter out the conditions that they are really reacting to. They can recognize it pretty accurately for everybody else, they just miss that for themselves. Which I think is interesting.\u201d\n\nUnderstanding an example of how conservatives\u2019 thinking leads them astray is the easy part, however. It helped to get our thinking in sync. But the real challenge would be making sense of how liberals and Democrats make comparable kinds of errors\u2014errors they cannot see. And here is where things had to get a bit tricky, since I had some ideas of what the errors might be, but given the Dunning-Kruger effect, I had to expect some ideas I\u2019d never thought of, too.\n\nThe next thing out of Dunning\u2019s mouth wasn\u2019t quite that\u2014but it did have some of that flavor. Above I mentioned a paper by John Jost that represents the integration of work done by hundreds, if not thousands of researchers over a period of several decades. That integration very much represents the broad consensus view of how liberal and conservative thought relate to one another\u2014a consensus that has since been significantly strengthened with the addition of a related finding in the physiological dimension. But there are at least two notable voices who stand out with somewhat contrasting views\u2014Jonathan Haidt and Dan Kahan\u2014and Dunning quickly mentioned both of their work as being harmonious with what I was saying.\n\nI could have gotten down into the details of their theories, but in a big picture sense, Dunning was perfectly right: They\u2019re all saying something similar\u2014that liberals and conservatives do think differently from one another, which means that they can both fall prey to the Dunning-Kruger effect in ways that may be different\u2014in terms of cognitive processes\u2014as well as similar\u2014produced by similar sorts of situations, for example. What\u2019s more, if one is concerned with trying to identify ways in which people are blind to their own shortcomings, then it\u2019s helpful to have as many different accounts as possible.\n\nKahan\u2019s work is particularly challenging, because he prefers to use a two-factor model of orientation\u2014hierarchical/egalitarian and individualist/communitarian\u2014rather than the single-factor measures used by most investigators, which can then be correlated with liberalism/conservatism. But he still does encounter and deal with real-world political questions where things tend to divide into two. One striking example is the \u201cwhite male effect,\u201d so-called because white males have been observed to be significantly less fearful about certain sorts of risks\u2014most notably ones associated with guns and the environment. In a 2007 paper, for example, Kahan and his colleagues wrote, \u201cThe insensitivity to risk reflected in the white male effect can thus be seen as a defensive response to a form of cultural identity threat that afflicts hierarchical and individualistic white males.\u201d Even though two factors were involved, the result was an effect most notable for setting one sub-population apart from the rest of the public\u2014a cognitive bifurcation of sorts.\n\n\u201cEssentially you have each side interpreting what\u2019s going on through different lenses,\u201d Dunning said of Kahan\u2019s work, and what connects this to his work is \u201cthe idea that people either have no idea that the other side has a different lens\u2014they literally don\u2019t know it, so that if you are looking at things the logos way, you really don\u2019t know that there\u2019s an alternative way of viewing the world is the mythos way. Or, if you are exposed to it, you think it\u2019s not real.\u201d Expanding on the later alternative, Dunning said, \u201cI can guess if you described the logos world to a person who was into mythos, and vice a versa, their response would be, well, that\u2019s a very interesting way of viewing the world, I wonder what took them off the right track.\u201d\n\nAlthough this made sense, my working thesis was not that most people don\u2019t have both mythos and logos in their experience\u2014that may or may not be true\u2014but that the political worlds of liberalism and conservatism are organized differently, so that only certain aspects of the personal resonate strongly with the political.\n\n\u201cWell, that makes sense,\u201d Dunning told me, then quickly added, \u201cI\u2019m from the other world, though, where I find it very easy to focus on the individual level.\u201d Which led directly to the next question on my mind: Is there specific evidence for the Dunning-Kruger effect overlapping from the individual level to larger social groups?\n\n\u201cThe answer is, yes it can,\u201d Dunning told me. He\u2019s still working on writing up experimental results, but he was happy to share some broader observations. \u201cIt\u2019s likely to happen in two different ways,\u201d he said. \u201cThe first is often you have organizations that are well set\u2013you can say they\u2019re very competent\u2013in their ways. They can have a problem when conditions on the ground shift, and you could say that in the last 10 or 20 years, the conditions on the grounds shifted demographically, in terms of the people, for example who vote in the midterm.\u201d Twenty years ago, these older voters had come of age during the Great Depression, and leaned Democratic as a result. But older voters now are much more Republican, which tends to skew the midterms in the opposite direction from the past. (The age-based difference in participation rates has also grown over time, as well.) As a result, Dunning said, \u201cYou have Republicans in midterms, and the occasional voters now are the young, and they\u2019re rather Democratic so there is oscillation between elections and that\u2019s a changed situation,\u201d which is precisely the first sort of thing that tends to trip up organizations.\n\n\u201cThe other thing is that the most recent work we\u2019ve done suggests that the real cost of the Dunning-Kruger framework at the organizational level is that when a very smart idea or very smart person comes along, the organizations are not necessarily very skilled at recognizing that person\u2019s genius,\u201d Dunning said. \u201cWe have lots of data showing that very top performers, their top performances are very much missed. The genius of their ideas are just missed by the group.\u201d\n\nThree examples on the Democratic side came readily to mind when Dunning said this. First was civil rights lawyer and Harvard law professor Lani Guinier, whose work on voting rights and representational fairness was easily demonized by the right when she was nominated to head the DOJ\u2019s Civil Rights Division, in part because Joe Biden (then chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee) couldn\u2019t understand it, and Bill Clinton didn\u2019t even take the time to try. Yet, in retrospect, if they had stood behind her, most of the GOP\u2019s voting rights mischief in the past 20 years\u2014including the theft of the 2000 election\u2014could have been avoided, or defeated, and there would be a much stronger foundation for multi-racial coalition politics at all levels of government.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Bush tanked the country.
