Yet he said he believed that congressional Republicans must set a policy agenda that offers a clear contrast to the angry insurgent refrain blasting into the winter primaries.\n\n\u201cIf we try to play our own version of identity politics and try to fuel ourselves based on darker emotions, that\u2019s not productive,\u201d Ryan said in a wide-ranging interview Friday. \u201cI don\u2019t think it will be successful, and I don\u2019t think it is the right thing to do. I believe in an agenda that\u2019s inspirational, that\u2019s inclusive, that\u2019s optimistic.\u201d\n\nRyan, the Republican nominee for vice president in 2012, added his powerful voice to a growing line of leaders of his party\u2019s establishment sounding an alarm about the tenor of the race just weeks before the first votes are cast in the nominating contests.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t about Trump,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cThis is about do we run on substance or do we run on personality? If we run on personality, we lose those elections.\u201d\n\nRyan, drafted by his party for his job and popular across a wide spectrum of his fractured party, clearly intends to have a voice in the nominating process, which he said could drag into the summer.\n\n\u201cI will use this bully pulpit as effectively as I can,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cFor now, it\u2019s the bully pulpit we have.\u201d\n\nRyan said the divisions between an exclusionary strain of hard-right conservatism and one focused on broad-based economic growth are neither new nor insurmountable, recalling his work as a young aide to his mentor, Rep. Jack Kemp of New York.\n\n\u201cI remember working for Jack fighting the Buchanan wing of the party on similar issues,\u201d Ryan said. He was referring to Kemp\u2019s efforts to combat Patrick Buchanan\u2019s campaign for president in 1992, which was rooted in a fight over America\u2019s \u201cculture wars\u201d and anti-immigration sensibilities.\n\n\u201cThese are not new discussions,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cThese are not new frictions.\u201d\n\nThe move to insert himself \u2014 and his Republican colleagues \u2014 into the presidential campaign is an abrupt detour from the road taken by his immediate predecessor, John Boehner, who stayed largely out of the 2012 campaign and had limited contact with the Republican nominee, Mitt Romney.\n\nIt also sets him apart from Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, who tends to focus on internal congressional business.\n\nRyan, who as speaker will also serve as chairman of the Republican National Convention in Cleveland next July, said he would strongly support any Republican nominee. Still, he said, \u201cI am going to speak my mind.\u201d\n\nHe wants to begin now, he said, because \u201cwhat I realized was that in 2012, by the time we got to that conversation it was already too late.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe narratives of these campaigns start earlier, and the trajectory of these campaigns get fixed into place,\u201d he added.\n\nRyan, 45, has built credibility since he became speaker in October with bipartisan legislation on education, highway funding and a budget agreement.\n\nBut he acknowledged that a presidential campaign year was unlikely to yield major legislation, and said he would, instead, use it to frame the choice between the parties.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going to solve these big problems with this president in the next year,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t see the parties close together on these issues. I see the need to offer a bold alternative\u201d to eight years of the Obama administration\u2019s agenda.\n\n\u201cTo me it isn\u2019t \u2018Let\u2019s split the difference on these issues,\u2019 because our differences are so far apart,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cIt\u2019s \u2018Let\u2019s give an alternative agenda and bring it to the country and let the country decide.\u2019 \u201d\n\nTrump condemns chief justice\u2019s votes\n\nAIKEN, S.C. \u2014 Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts is \u201cdisgraceful\u201d and a \u201cdisappointment\u201d to conservatives, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump said Saturday, while praising Associate Justice Clarence Thomas as his favorite member of the high court.\n\n\u201cJustice Roberts really let us down. What he did with Obamacare was disgraceful, and I think he did that because he wanted to be popular inside the Beltway,\u201d Trump told about 4,000 supporters.\n\nThe celebrity billionaire was referring to the chief justice twice voting to uphold key provisions of President Obama\u2019s 2010 health-care law and to the expressway around the District of Columbia, an area regarded as the center of U.S. government and politics.\n\nThomas, arguably one of the court\u2019s most conservative members, is \u201cvery strong and consistent,\u201d Trump said.\n\nThe GOP front-runner offered his assessment during an hourlong question-and-answer session with state Attorney General Alan Wilson.\n\nThe South Carolina Republican is hosting a series of forums in this early voting state to query GOP hopefuls about their theories on constitutional law and the role of the federal government.\n\nTrump pledged to gut executive actions taken by Obama, but the only policy area he mentioned was immigration. \u201cHe signed an executive order where people can just pour in,\u201d Trump said, a reference to executive orders intended to forestall deportation for certain immigrants already in the country illegally.\n\nPrompted by Wilson, Trump also blasted government regulations. He focused his ire on water regulations that he says flood the market with bad faucets, toilets and shower heads.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no water pressure,\u201d he complained. \u201cThe problem is you stand under the shower five times as long wasting more water than if you used the other one. So people are flushing seven, eight, 10 times. The end result is that it\u2019s no good and you end up wasting more water.\n\n\u201cI could name hundreds like that,\u201d Trump concluded about the regulations.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Urging a GOP presidential campaign based on substance rather than personality, House Speaker Paul Ryan says Congress must confront Donald Trump\u2019s polarizing populism if it wants to win the White House.", "og": {"site_name": "The Seattle Times", "description": "Urging a GOP presidential campaign based on substance rather than personality, House Speaker Paul Ryan says Congress must confront Donald Trump\u2019s polarizing populism if it wants to win the White House.", "title": "Ryan: \u2018Inclusive\u2019 agenda beats polarizing campaign", "url": "http://www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/nation-politics/ryan-inclusive-agenda-beats-polarizing-campaign/", "image": {"width": 1560, "identifier": "http://static.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/f455852a-a12d-11e5-93f8-f794e7de41d1-1560x1040.jpg", "height": 1040}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@seattletimes", "description": "Urging a GOP presidential campaign based on substance rather than personality, House Speaker Paul Ryan says Congress must confront Donald Trump\u2019s polarizing populism if it wants to win the White House.", "card": "http://static.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/f455852a-a12d-11e5-93f8-f794e7de41d1-780x520.jpg", "title": "Ryan: \u2018Inclusive\u2019 agenda beats polarizing campaign"}, "robots": "noarchive", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=329502124", "fb": {"admins": 2737159, "app_id": 1522735777957334, "pages": 38472826214}, "msvalidate.01": "29FBBD36D14799A9FDE7843BF1E1CDD7", "article": {"section": "Nation & World Politics", "published_time": "2015-12-12 17:31:22", "modified_time": "2015-12-12 17:31:22"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Nation & World, Nation & World Politics"}, "article_summary": "\u201cThis isn\u2019t about Trump,\u201d Ryan said.\nUrging a GOP presidential campaign based on substance rather than personality, House Speaker Paul Ryan says Congress must confront Donald Trump\u2019s polarizing populism if it wants to win the White House.\nBut he acknowledged that a presidential campaign year was unlikely to yield major legislation, and said he would, instead, use it to frame the choice between the parties.\nThat Republican, House Speaker Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, said he felt professionally obligated to support whoever wins the party\u2019s presidential nomination next year.\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Concerned about the harshly negative presidential campaign dominated by Donald Trump, the nation\u2019s highest-ranking Republican says Congress must confront Trump\u2019s polarizing populism by promoting an \u201cinclusive,\u201d policy-focused agenda to counter any personality-driven run sure to cost his party the White House."}
