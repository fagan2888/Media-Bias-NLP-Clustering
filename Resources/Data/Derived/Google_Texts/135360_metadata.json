My instinct is to leave immediately and find a quieter place to caffeinate, but I\u2019m not here for the coffee. I\u2019m here for information \u2014 information on what I\u2019m hearing is one of the hottest new trends in brain science.\n\nWinding my way through tables of frazzled co-eds, I search every face for that \u201cAre you who I\u2019m looking for?\u201d stare, but no one acknowledges me. So I step back out onto the sidewalk and wait. I\u2019m early anyway.\n\nAbout five minutes later, a young man who would have otherwise been indistinguishable from the crowd of students locks eyes with me from about 20 feet away. \u201cThat\u2019s my guy,\u201d I think to myself.\n\nMinutes later, coffees in hand, we\u2019re seated at a small back table, and I put my digital recorder down on it. \u201cIs it okay if I record this?\u201d I ask. He says that\u2019s fine.\n\nAt this point, what I really want to do is grab him by the shoulders and yell, \u201cWhat are you people doing? Let me into your world!\u201d For weeks, I\u2019ve been looking into this new field of research called computational psychiatry, but for the life of me, I can\u2019t figure out what it is. More frustratingly, I can\u2019t figure out why I can\u2019t figure it out, despite a strong science background and hours of reading what little I could find about the topic on the Internet.\n\nBut I hold back, press the little red circle on my digital recorder and let the man speak.\n\nIn computational psychiatry, \u201cWhat you try to do is come up with a toy world\u2026,\u201d he begins.\n\nThis all started a few weeks earlier when I was perusing the latest edition of Current Opinion in Neurobiology. Don\u2019t ask me why I was perusing Current Opinion in Neurobiology \u2014 I don\u2019t know. To avoid doing something else, probably.\n\nOne article caught my eye. It was titled \u201cComputational approaches to psychiatry.\u201d A longtime subscriber to the drugs-and-therapy stereotype of psychiatry, I found the idea of new \u201ccomputational approaches\u201d intriguing, so I read on.\n\nA Promising New Approach\n\n\u201cA major reason for the disappointing progress of psychiatric diagnostics\u2026\u201d began the authors, neuroscientists Klaas Enno Stephan and Christoph Mathys, \u201cis largely because doctors are still diagnosing mental diseases purely based on clinical symptoms.\u201d\n\nYes, I thought to myself, I\u2019ve heard that before. In fact, I heard it a lot last year when the fifth edition of the \u201cDiagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders\u201d came out.\n\n\u201cA promising new approach is the use of computational modeling for inferring mechanisms which generate observed behavior and brain activity in psychiatric patients,\u201d Stephan and Mathys wrote.\n\nComputational modeling. That meant using computer simulations. I knew scientists had done that for years to understand all kinds of things \u2014 weather patterns, protein folding, airplane flight. Come to think of it, neuroscientists had already been using computers to model individual brain cells and circuits, and some have even tried to model entire brains.\n\nComputational psychiatry departments were popping up around the world \u2014 London, Zurich, here in the U.S. at Virginia Tech.\n\nBut this paper was about something new. It was about the work going on in \u201ccomputational psychiatry\u201d departments popping up around the world. It was what everyone was talking about at what some are calling the world\u2019s first \u201ccomputational psychiatry\u201d conference, held last year in Miami.\n\nI trudged through the paper to find out what all the excitement was about, but got lost in technical jargon along the way. Afterward, when I tried to explain computational psychiatry to a few friends, it became brutally obvious that I had no idea what I was talking about.\n\n\u201cThese people want to model brains\u2026er\u2026.maybe just parts of brains,\u201d I would say, \u201c\u2026and then\u2026uh\u2026mental disorders\u2026they want to understand diseases like depression and schizophrenia.\u201d It was no better than me trying to explain reading by saying that it\u2019s when people look at books, and then they know things.\n\nI called up Read Montague, head of the computational psychiatry department at Virginia Tech, for help. He told me that he considered scientists\u2019 current understanding of psychiatric diseases \u201cpathetic\u201d and thought that computational models could help remedy that. He also told me that computational psychiatry was a growing field and \u201ca young person\u2019s game.\u201d\n\nMontague sounded excited, and that evoked in me the same intrigue I felt when I read the beginning of the Stephan and Mathys paper. But he didn\u2019t have much time to talk, so we never got into the gritty details of what he and his colleagues were doing and how it would change the field of psychiatry.\n\nWe only touched on the big picture, which I already understood. I knew that the goal of computational psychiatry was to find better ways to diagnose and treat mental disorders, and I knew that computational modeling meant using computer simulations. What I didn\u2019t get was why this was a new field. Both the goal and the method of getting there had been around for years.\n\nThere was some part of this story that I just wasn\u2019t seeing.\n\nConference Brings Computational Psychiatry Into Clearer Focus\n\nI tucked computational psychiatry away in the back of my mind for a couple of weeks until I got wind of a one-day computational neuroscience conference happening near my home in Cambridge, Mass. The conference description made no mention of computational psychiatry, but the whole event would focus on using computational methods to understand mental disorders, so it sounded like computational psychiatry to me.\n\nThe day started with the usual spiel \u2014 We don\u2019t really understand mental disorders, and computational models could help fix that \u2014 then launched into a series of talks from doctors, computer scientists and entrepreneurs.\n\nThey didn\u2019t deconstruct one of these models, which was what I was hoping for, but during one of the breaks, I grabbed a conference organizer and asked him to do just that. He quickly looked around and grabbed someone else to explain it to me.\n\nThe man he pulled over was Dave King, the CEO of a local data visualization company called Exaptive. In partnership with the Accelerated Cure Project (ACP), a non-profit devoted to curing multiple sclerosis, King and others at Exaptive had been working on a computer program that combined data from dozens of disparate multiple sclerosis studies. The ACP has a repository of more than 3,000 blood samples from MS patients, their relatives and unrelated control participants. Anyone can do studies with the samples \u2014 big corporations, small non-profits and anything in between \u2014 as long as they share their results with the ACP. Exaptive\u2019s program would take these returned results and find which studies used the same samples.\n\nRight now, King told me, MS patients have to try a series of medications on blind faith that one will work for them. It\u2019s time consuming and not always effective, he said. By looking at multiple studies that used the same samples, he said, Exaptive\u2019s program could hopefully give doctors more insight into the disease and lead to more individualized treatment.\n\nThe program looked very cool on King\u2019s laptop, but it wasn\u2019t the kind of modeling I had read and heard about in the context of computational psychiatry. It did, however, bring up something that became central to the day\u2019s talks and to my understanding of computational psychiatry \u2014 big data.\n\nIn retrospect, the fact that big data would play a role in this story shouldn\u2019t have been a big surprise. After all, the computer simulations would have to run on something.\n\nAfter that conference, the light bulb I imagined hovering over my head was still dark.\n\nAfter that conference, the light bulb I imagined hovering over my head was still dark. I had yet to find out why computational modeling, which had been around for years, was suddenly the basis of a new field.\n\nGoogle wasn\u2019t much help. I could only find either technical papers that went over my head or superficial summaries that had a lot of buzzwords and hand waving. Likewise, the short conversations I had with Montague and King weren\u2019t enough to get me past the elevator pitch.\n\nThoroughly frustrated at that point, I was ready to throw my hands up and just cheer on computational psychiatry because its name and aspirations impressed me.\n\nThat\u2019s when I came across the blog of a young computational neuroscientist who worked nearby at Boston University. His name was Yohan John, and one of his recent posts was titled \u201cHow is depression (and other mental disorders) addressed with computational neuroscience?\u201d\n\nJackpot.\n\nIn the post, he offered a simple outline of the kind of model he was talking about: start with a simulated circuit of neurons, dictate how these neurons should behave using real data gathered through experimental techniques like brain imaging or EEG, and then change various pieces of the model to see how that behavior changes.\n\nAs soon as I finished reading the blog post, I looked up John\u2019s e-mail address and sent him a message asking if we could meet. He quickly replied that he would be happy to chat.\n\nBig Data Over Small Coffees\n\nSitting in the coffee shop at a two-person table in a crowded row, John tells me that there are two broad categories of computational neuroscientists: those who do data analysis and those who do theoretical work.\n\nSomething clicks in my head when John says \u201ctheoretical.\u201d\n\nIn a way, \u201ctheoretical neuroscience\u201d and \u201ccomputational neuroscience\u201d are synonymous. Modeling even simple neural circuits is so complex, John tells me, that theorists can\u2019t do much of anything with just pencil and paper and instead have to use computers. It\u2019s as simple as that.\n\nI feel silly admitting this, but just renaming computational neuroscientists as theorists in my mind changes everything. I immediately think of physics, my undergraduate major and perhaps the gold standard for a healthy and longstanding interplay between theory and experiment. I already feel like I have a better understanding of what computational neuroscientists, and by extension computational psychiatrists, are trying to do.\n\nI ask John, who in fact did his undergraduate degree in physics as well, if the comparison is valid, and he says that it is but that one big difference between physics and neuroscience is that theoretical physics is so well-established that theorists tend to be more famous than experimentalists. The opposite is true in neuroscience.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re sort of still having to prove ourselves,\u201d he says, but theory and experiment will both be important if we ever want to understand this largely mysterious organ.\n\n\u201cSome experimentalist could just chance upon something that really, really works and not know why exactly, but a theoretical framework might give them a clue,\u201d John says. \u201cThe experimentalists don\u2019t have that much time to think about theory, and there\u2019s enough complexity there that it\u2019s worth having someone more or less devoted to how the system\u2019s working.\u201d\n\nIn this \u2018toy world\u2019 built on a computer, computational neuroscientists can break something in the circuit and see if it results in behavior consistent with, say, depression.\n\nWhen we finally get to talking about models, I admit to John that I\u2019m having a hard time grasping what exactly they are and what they can do for psychiatry. He tells me to think of a computer model as a set of cogs and wheels that scientists build in a virtual universe and then strategically break to see how certain malfunctions affect the model\u2019s overall behavior.\n\nFor mental disorders, the cogs and wheels are neural circuits in parts of the brain that experiments have shown play a role in certain illnesses. In this \u201ctoy world\u201d built on a computer, John says, computational neuroscientists can break something in the circuit and see if it results in behavior consistent with, say, depression. Using that model, scientists can then come up with new theories of how depression works and partner with experimentalists to test those theories.\n\nIt\u2019s like, in physics, how Peter Higgs theorized the existence of the Higgs boson in the 1960s, and then physicists used the Large Hadron Collider to get experimental confirmation that it existed.\n\nNot long after talking with John, that light bulb above my head finally turns on. I realize that nothing John told me about these models surprised me. I understood how computer models worked. I\u2019ve actually worked with them myself.\n\nI\u2019ve been so frustrated trying to figure out the cutting-edge part of computational psychiatry, when what was actually tripping me up was what wasn\u2019t cutting-edge about it. Computational modeling has been around for a long time and so has the desire to understand mental disorders.\n\nIn an instant, my question changes from \u201cWhat am I missing?\u201d to \u201cWhy now?\u201d\n\nSearching For A Deeper Understanding Of The Brain\n\n\u201cThe biological revolution in psychiatry occurred around the time that people were getting tired of Freud,\u201d Jonathan Cohen, a researcher at Princeton University who\u2019s been doing what\u2019s now called computational psychiatry for years, said.\n\nCohen has a lot to say about the sociology of brain research \u2014 the early divide between psychology and neuroscience, between the mind and the brain. The biological revolution that he\u2019s telling me about is the hard science approach to psychiatry that evolved with new experimental techniques and led to the realization that drugs could improve mental illness.\n\n\u201cAnd so they threw the baby out with the bathwater in the sense that they said, \u2018Listen, any attempt to try and understand the mechanisms of thought, which smacks too much of Freudianism, is just not interesting to us anymore. We want the real mechanisms \u2014 the biology \u2014 and for that we\u2019re going to go do the biology now that we can do it. By the way, that\u2019s what Freud wanted too. He just didn\u2019t have the tools,\u201d Cohen tells me.\n\nAs a result, he says, scientists know, for example, that reducing levels of the neurotransmitter dopamine gets rid of hallucinations in people with schizophrenia, but what they don\u2019t know is why. It\u2019s like saying that a brake works by stopping a car, Cohen says, but not saying how it stops the car.\n\n\u201cAll of the [psychiatric] drugs that worked,\u201d Cohen says, \u201cwere more or less discovered by serendipity. They were not discovered by an understanding of how the brain works and somebody saying, \u2018Oh, well, geez, since this is how the brain works, and this is what\u2019s going wrong in that disease, why don\u2019t we design a drug to go do that to fix it?\u2019 Never. Never has that happened as far as I know. It\u2019s all been, \u2018Wow, we tried it for blood pressure and those people seem less depressed. Maybe we could use it as an anti-depressant.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u2018You\u2019d be hard pressed to find a neuroscience department in this country that has a pure theorist.\u2019\n\nWhat psychiatry needs, Cohen says, is a deeper understanding of how the brain as a system manifests mental illnesses. Treatment can\u2019t simply rely on matching symptoms to diagnoses; symptoms should inform doctors how the brain is malfunctioning so they can figure out how to fix it.\n\n\u201cYou would not want to go to a car mechanic who doesn\u2019t know something about combustion, right? I mean, that would be absurd. You wouldn\u2019t want them saying, \u2018Wow, your car doesn\u2019t seem to be working. Let me take some oil and poor it over here and see if that helps.\u2019\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s where computational psychiatry comes in.\n\nCohen had always been interested in both the mind and the brain, so for a long time he felt frustrated by the division between neuroscience and psychology, he tells me. It wasn\u2019t until he was doing his medical school residency in psychiatry at Stanford University that he came across a way to do both \u2014 computational modeling.\n\n\u201cThat was exactly what I had been hungering for,\u201d he said.\n\nAt Stanford, Cohen met psychologist Jay McClelland, who at the time was working on computer models that could do things like conjugate verbs, perceive stimuli and make decisions, Cohen says.\n\nAfter medical school, Cohen went back to get a PhD in cognitive psychology at Carnegie Mellon University with the intent of using the computational methods developed by McClelland and other early pioneers to understand mental disorders.\n\nCohen has been particularly interested in schizophrenia. Early in his career, he built a model to explain why people with schizophrenia can list homonyms \u2014 words that are spelled the same but have different definitions \u2014 but when given one of these words in context, they always pick the most common definition. Asked why a farmer bought a pen for his chickens, Cohen explains, a schizophrenic person might say that the farmer needed to write a check because chickens are expensive.\n\nCohen\u2019s model predicted that this common symptom in schizophrenia resulted from faulty representation of contextual information in the brain.\n\nSo again, if people like Cohen have been doing this for decades, why now?\n\nA lot has happened since the 1980s, Cohen tells me. Computers have gotten more powerful, new experimental techniques have led to deeper insight into how the brain works, which has led to more robust models. Perhaps most importantly, functional MRI brain imaging came along. This real-time imaging technique is a great way to test model predictions, Cohen says.\n\nSo at long last, computational psychiatry is here, and the small cohort of researchers like Cohen who have been doing this for a long time might finally have some company. Indeed, Cohen says, company would be nice. The Obama Brain Initiative might be pushing for new tools, Cohen tells me, but as far as computational psychiatry is concerned, there\u2019s plenty to do with existing tools. What this new field needs is warm bodies.\n\nBut just as Yohan John told me in the coffee shop, Cohen says that theorists in neuroscience are few and far between compared to experimentalists.\n\n\u201cIf you ask a kid in grade school, \u2018What is science about?\u2019 What do they tell you? They say, \u2018Oh, you have a hypothesis or theory and then you go and do an experiment to test it,\u201d Cohen said. \u201cYou\u2019d be hard pressed to find a neuroscience department in this country that has a pure theorist. That\u2019s just a remarkable fact, and I think it says a lot about what needs to be done to make real progress.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "A personal quest for understanding: What the heck is computational psychiatry and why does it seem to be such a hot field of neuroscience right now?", "og": {"site_name": "commonhealth", "description": "A personal quest for understanding: What the heck is computational psychiatry and why does it seem to be such a hot field of neuroscience right now?", "title": "In Search Of \u2018Computational Psychiatry:\u2019 Why Is It A Hot New Field?", "url": "http://commonhealth.wbur.org/2014/07/computational-psychiatry", "image": "http://s3.amazonaws.com/media.wbur.org/wordpress/15/files/2014/07/8384110298_b0bc7d6435_o-620x465.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://commonhealth.wbur.org/2014/07/computational-psychiatry", "image": "//s3.amazonaws.com/media.wbur.org/wordpress/15/files/2014/07/8384110298_b0bc7d6435_o-620x465.jpg", "site": "@commonhealth", "card": "summary", "title": "In Search Of 'Computational Psychiatry:' Why Is It A Hot New Field?"}, "DC.date.issued": "2014-07-04", "msvalidate.01": "D02D46BAEDB3F81FC1B1DE2A8CB69551", "fb": {"admins": 1549080028, "app_id": 134067973330252}, "date": "Fri, 04 Jul 2014 08:54:40 -0400"}, "article_summary": "Conference Brings Computational Psychiatry Into Clearer FocusI tucked computational psychiatry away in the back of my mind for a couple of weeks until I got wind of a one-day computational neuroscience conference happening near my home in Cambridge, Mass.\nThe conference description made no mention of computational psychiatry, but the whole event would focus on using computational methods to understand mental disorders, so it sounded like computational psychiatry to me.\nIn Search Of \u2018Computational Psychiatry:\u2019 Why Is It A Hot New Field?\nIn computational psychiatry, \u201cWhat you try to do is come up with a toy world\u2026,\u201d he begins.\nComputational psychiatry departments were popping up around the world \u2014 London, Zurich, here in the U.S. at Virginia Tech."}
