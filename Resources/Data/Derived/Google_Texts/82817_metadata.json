Polls suggest young Americans might be open to the message.\n\n\"Creepy Uncle Sam\" is doubling down! He\u2019s got new ads out, and he\u2019s using the image-sharing site Snapchat in his campaign to scare young Americans away from Obamacare.\n\nWill he and his creator, the conservative political nonprofit Generation Opportunity, successfully convince Millennials they shouldn\u2019t sign up for insurance via President Obama\u2019s signature Affordable Care Act? The final answer to that won\u2019t be clear until March 31 of next year, the deadline for 2014 enrollment, if then.\n\nBut Creepy Uncle Sam\u2019s weird vibe does appear to have irritated Mr. Obama himself. At a White House Youth Summit devoted to the ACA last week, the president said \u201cbelieve it or not, there are actually organizations that are out there working to convince young people not to get insurance.\u201d\n\nRecommended: How much do you know about health-care reform? Take our quiz!\n\n\u201cNow think about that. That\u2019s a really bizarre way to spend your money,\u201d said Obama, presumably referring to the wealthy donors who fund those organizations.\n\nIn case you\u2019ve never heard of him, Creepy Uncle Sam is a large-head costumed actor similar in appearance to a college sports mascot. But the frozen expression on his enormous face is ... creepy. There\u2019s no other word for it. As we\u2019ve previously said, he looks like a freaky, patriotic garden gnome.\n\nAnd Generation Opportunity has employed him in ads creepy enough to be controversial on their own. In one, a young woman is set to have a gynecological exam, when Creepy arises from between her legs snapping a speculum. \u201cDon\u2019t leg government play doctor,\u201d reads the video\u2019s tagline. \u201cOpt out of Obamacare.\u201d\n\nIn October, Creepy starred in his own mini-Halloween movie, which ended with him making some kind of triumphant guttural roar over a stash of candy extorted from frightened Millennials.\n\nOn Dec. 5, Generation Opportunity dropped a new Creepy ad, titled \u201cNot a Game.\u201d It features a panning shot of a hospital while a female voiceover talks about why Millennials are opting out of Obamacare, interrupted by periodic buzzing.\n\nAt a crucial point the voice says her generation is not doing the ACA because, \u201cWe have not lost our [expletive] minds.\u201d Her swearing is bleeped out by the buzzing sound, which turns out to be caused by Creepy Uncle Sam playing \u2013 and losing at \u2013 the old board game \u201cOperation.\u201d\n\nAnother ad released last week noted that Creepy will be on Snapchat, where users can share pictures and videos that self-delete after 10 seconds. But it\u2019s not clear how extensive an audience he\u2019ll reach on the site, which is popular with a young demographic, given that users have to request images from particular sources. Millennials that will sign up at creepyuncle.sam may already lean towards Generation Opportunity\u2019s position.\n\nRight now Millennials don\u2019t appear convinced they can gain from Obamacare coverage, given its botched rollout. A much-covered poll released by Harvard\u2019s Institute of Politics last week found that solid majorities of the Millennial generation disapprove of the president\u2019s health reform package, whether it\u2019s described as the \u201cAffordable Care Act\u201d or \u201cObamacare.\u201d Fewer than 3 of every 10 Millennial poll respondents said they will definitely or probably sign up for coverage through an ACA exchange marketplace.\n\n\u201cThose are not numbers that suggest a population that\u2019s poised to fall in line, do its civic duty, and fell warm and fuzzy in the process,\u201d writes right-leaning New York Times columnist Ross Douthat.\n\nThe question will be whether that attitude persists. As a new Gallup survey has found, when it comes to Obamacare, younger Americans know the least. Thirty-seven percent say they are \u201cnot familiar at all\u201d with the law\u2019s specifics.\n\nAnd it\u2019s possible that Millennials just won\u2019t really know what they\u2019re going to do on health care until confronted by the hard deadline of next March, after which they\u2019ll have to pay the IRS a fine if they don\u2019t have health coverage.\n\nMany may remain on their parents\u2019 plans, notes political scientist Jonathan Bernstein on his \u201cA plain blog about politics.\u201d Others don\u2019t realize that state-based exchanges and HealthCare.gov are related to the ACA at all.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think the poll tells us anything about what young people are going to do when they get to that point of seeking insurance,\u201d writes Mr. Bernstein.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.content.id": "b3296fc6d010e4ffc0ac33015ff506ed", "sailthru.author": "Peter Grier", "description": "The Creepy Uncle Sam ad campaign has taken conservatives' anti-Obamacare message to Millennials.
