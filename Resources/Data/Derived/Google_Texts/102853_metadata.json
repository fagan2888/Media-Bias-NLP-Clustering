It was a one-night stand, an evening uprising. Nevertheless, the young John Adams judged it so intrepid and consequential as to mark \u201can epocha in history.\u201d\n\nThe British government agreed. Lord North warned the Commons that a turning point had been reached. \u201cWe are now to establish our authority,\u201d he said, \u201cor give it up entirely.\u201d We all know how that turned out.\n\nBoth the old and the new Tea Party stand for resistance to unconstitutional power. In 1773 the Tea Partiers opposed the Tea Act, which violated their rights as Englishmen and as men. Their counterparts today fight against Obamacare, a much worse law. And they have enough orneriness left over to confront many other usurpations by the Obama Administration as well as several inherited from Bush II.\n\nModern liberalism can neither fathom nor tolerate the Tea Party. Liberals don\u2019t believe in a right of revolution against liberalism. They consider progress as they define it to be irreversible. For example, here is Barack Obama at his most peremptory, calling in 2009 for nationalized health care. \u201cI am not the first president to take up this cause,\u201d he told Congress, \u201cbut I am determined to be the last.\u201d\n\nAs liberals see it, conservatism\u2019s job is to conserve liberalism. When it threatens to overturn a program like Obamacare, then the Right ceases to be conservative and becomes radical, indeed revolutionary insofar as it threatens not just a cabinet department or two but the whole religion of one-way leftward progress and the whole worshipful establishment built around that faith.\n\nEven a smart liberal like Sam Tanenhaus considers the Tea Party to be the last gasp of a dying conservatism that has ceased to be Burkean and become, in his word, \u201cJacobin,\u201d that is, revolutionary in the bad, French sense. Of course, the Tea Party\u2019s very name refers to a revolution\u2014but to the American Revolution, not the irrational French one. Tanenhaus doesn\u2019t see much of a difference because he seems to dismiss as extremist any form of politics that doesn\u2019t go with the evolutionary flow, and that appeals to universal and timeless principles of justice. One is tempted to say that he rejects natural rights as firmly as John C. Calhoun did and for a similar reason: they endanger the ancien regime, which in our time is liberalism.\n\nIf the Tea Party is revolutionary, it is so only in the traditional American sense: it wants to revolve back, to return to the Constitution and the principles of the Declaration of Independence as the basis of government. This is the deepest reason why the Obama Administration has reacted to this Tea Party as Lord North did to the original. If Obamacare is overturned, then liberals will have lost control of the future and hence of their legitimacy; and if they lose the future, they will lose the present, too. So the Tea Party must be stopped at all costs.\n\nLiberals like to denounce the tea party as inherently \u201cdysfunctional,\u201d which in translation means: it stands athwart History yelling Stop! The whole conservative movement since William F. Buckley, Jr., is dysfunctional for the same reason. The Constitution itself is dysfunctional\u2014full of institutions like checks and balances, bicameralism, the separation of powers, and federalism designed to temper hope and to slow political change, to force time for deliberation and due process, to conserve the people\u2019s loyalty to the Constitution and laws.\n\nWhat the battle over Obamacare has helped to reveal is that it isn\u2019t just two clashing interpretations of the same Constitution that divide liberals and conservatives today. It is increasingly two different constitutions that are locked in conflict. Liberals support the \u201cliving constitution,\u201d which regards the bulk of the 1787 document as dysfunctional under modern conditions, hence obsolete if not, indeed, dead. They recognize only a few phrases in a few amendments as truly vital.\n\nConservatives cling to the old Constitution (as amended) not merely because it is old but because its principles of justice, based in human nature, are correct, and because its institutions and customs wisely anticipate both human greatness and human baseness. From this point of view, it is the passage of Obamacare\u2014with its hasty party-line votes, corrupt side-deals, and brazen lawlessness\u2014and not its attempted repeal, that amounted to a constitutional dysfunction.\n\nBoth the Tea Party and the Obama Administration understand the stakes. But it will take a lot more than an evening\u2019s Tea Party to win this struggle.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The original tea party was neither a political organization nor a populist movement.
