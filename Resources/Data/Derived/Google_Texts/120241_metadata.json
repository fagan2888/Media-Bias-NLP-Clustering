There have been cases where it has worked and where it hasn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nSome of the doctor shortage has been addressed by doctors coming to the U.S. from other countries.\n\n\u201cIndia has been the biggest provider of physicians to help us address our national gap,\u201d Loveridge reported. \u201cOver the last two years, 2,800 providers have come to the U.S. The Philippines, Pakistan and Mexico are much smaller, but still important providers.\u201d\n\nOther Issues\n\nAnother set of issues involves mental health and substance abuse.\n\n\u201cThis plays out a little differently in rural areas because we often work in a solitary fashion,\u201d Loveridge said. \u201cWe\u2019re doing outdoor work, so we\u2019re not interacting with people on a regular basis.\u201d\n\nIn addition, invisible homeless may lurk in rural areas.\n\n\u201cIn downtown Chicago, we see people with signs,\u201d Loveridge said. \u201cBut in rural America, they might be living in the woods, an abandoned house or couch surfing by living with relatives.\u201d\n\nSince homeless people in rural areas are not quite as visible it is harder to count them and bring them into systems that can help.\n\nAnother issue is rural areas tend to be conservative in regard to mental health. People are encouraged to be tough and deal with it, Loveridge said.\n\nAnd, when rural residents do seek help, he added, their social networks tend to be destroyed.\n\nTelemedicine may have some advantages for rural areas.\n\n\u201cIt can potentially lower costs and residents can more easily tie into specialized providers,\u201d Loveridge explained. \u201cBut broadband is a limiting factor in rural areas.\u201d\n\nAlthough telemedicine may provide access to a wider range of services to rural areas, there could be negative consequences to a community.\n\n\u201cYou are replacing someone with a high wage with someone who has less training and a lower wage,\u201d Loveridge said.\n\n\u201cMy advice is to think holistically,\u201d he said. \u201cPut strategies in place that make sense for the community.\u201d\n\nMartha Blum can be reached at 815-223-2558, ext. 117, or marthablum@agrinews-pubs.com.
