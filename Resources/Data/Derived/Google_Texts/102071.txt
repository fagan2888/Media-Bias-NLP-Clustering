The Indianapolis Star, once considered a conservative newspaper, has buckled to critics flinging the charge of “racism,” and pulled a cartoon it published mocking President Obama’s amnesty declaration. Jeff Taylor, executive editor, published this apology:

On Friday, we posted a Gary Varvel cartoon atindystar.com that offended a wide group of readers.

Many of them labeled it as racist. Gary did not intend to be racially insensitive in his attempt to express his strong views about President Barack Obama's decision to temporarily prevent the deportation of millions of immigrants living and working illegally in the United States.

But we erred in publishing it.

The cartoon depicted an immigrant family climbing through a window of a white family's home as Thanksgiving dinner was served. I was uncomfortable with the depiction when I saw it after it was posted. We initially decided to leave the cartoon posted to allow readers to comment and because material can never truly be eliminated once it is circulating on the web. But we are removing the cartoon from the opinion section of our website, as well as an earlier version posted on Facebook that showed one character with a mustache.

As someone who sported a mustache many years of my adult life, I tsake exception to the idea it is an ethnic stereotype.
