(Handout photo)\n\nBy Henry Bailey\n\nThe musical lineup will educate on regional culture as well as energize with \u201cmonster\u201d dancing dynamics at the Jan. 18 Crystal Ball fundraiser for the Community Foundation of Northwest Mississippi at the Arena at Southaven.\n\nThe deadline to purchase tickets is Friday.\n\nGala-goers will feast on dinner music by the Delta Music Institute All Stars, which banded in 2013 to represent Delta State University during Grammy week in Los Angeles.\n\n\u201cOh, it\u2019s going to be fabulous,\u201d said Stacye Rawlings, foundation spokeswoman. \u201cIt\u2019ll be native Mississippi music. And the week after the Crystal Ball, they\u2019ll be playing at the Grammys again.\u201d\n\nThe DMI All Stars are entertainment industry majors at the institute in Cleveland, Miss., and they only do songs written or performed by Magnolia State winners of Grammys, presented by the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences.\n\nWhich means the All Stars have an extensive playlist, said foundation president Tom Pittman,\n\n\u201cMississippi has more Grammy winners per capita than any other state,\u201d Pittman said of the birthplace of the Delta blues and Elvis Presley.\n\nLeading off the musical program at the Crystal Ball will be Mark Anderson, resident deejay for the Peabody Rooftop Party series in Memphis, with his \u201cVideo Super Show,\u201d said Pittman.\n\nAfter dinner, the gala rocks into party mode with a regional favorite, Dr. Zarr\u2019s Amazing Funk Monster band: They range from disco infernos to \u201980s glam rock, and \u201cthey\u2019re guaranteed to get everyone out their seats and dancing,\u201d said Pittman.\n\nThe ball\u2019s musical range fits nicely under this year\u2019s \u201cStudio 14\u201d dance club theme, he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll have dozens of volunteers transforming the arena.\u201d\n\nThe black-tie preferred gala is chaired by Jimmy and Courtney Tharp; the night\u2019s Star honoree is Pittman\u2019s brother, MTV founder Bob Pittman, and four local Community Stars also will also be recognized. The evening will include live and silent auctions with items ranging from a weeklong stay in Chicago to a bear hunt in Arkansas.\n\nThe Crystal Ball benefits some 400 nonprofit groups and causes through the Community Foundation, founded in 2002 and serving DeSoto and nine other counties \u2014 Bolivar, Coahoma, Marshall, Panola, Quitman, Sunflower, Tallahatchie, Tate and Tunica. Tickets are $150 per person and are available at 662-449-5002 or online at cfnm.org.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019ll be exciting, educational and fun, all in one package,\u201d said Tom Pittman.", "article_metadata": {"title": "From blues to funk, music lineup sparkes for Crystal Ball fundraiser in Southaven", "og": {"url": "http://www.commercialappeal.com/news/from-blues-to-funk-music-lineup-sparkes-for-crystal-ball-fundraiser-in-southaven-ep-307096098-326082421.html", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.jrn.com/images/48649_3532209_ver1.0_640_480.jpg", "height": 428}, "type": "article", "description": "The musical lineup will educate on regional culture as well as energize with \u00e2\u0080\u009cmonster\u00e2\u0080\u009d dancing dynamics at the Jan. 18 Crystal Ball fundraiser for the Community Foundation of Northwest Mississippi at the Arena at Southaven.", "title": "From blues to funk, music lineup sparkes for Crystal Ball fundraiser in Southaven"}, "twitter": {"site": "https://twitter.com/memphisnews", "image": "http://media.jrn.com/images/48649_3532209_ver1.0_640_480.jpg", "description": "The musical lineup will educate on regional culture as well as energize with \u00e2\u0080\u009cmonster\u00e2\u0080\u009d dancing dynamics at the Jan. 18 Crystal Ball fundraiser for the Community Foundation of Northwest Mississippi at the Arena at Southaven.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "From blues to funk, music lineup sparkes for Crystal Ball fundraiser in Southaven"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://media.jrn.com/designimages/logo-ca-icon-144.png", "__sync_contentCategory": "premium", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3564\"", "article_summary": "The Delta Music Institute All Stars will perform Jan. 18 at Crystal Ball fundraiser at the Arena at Southaven for the Community Foundation of Northwest Mississippi.\nGala-goers will feast on dinner music by the Delta Music Institute All Stars, which banded in 2013 to represent Delta State University during Grammy week in Los Angeles.\n(Handout photo)By Henry BaileyThe musical lineup will educate on regional culture as well as energize with \u201cmonster\u201d dancing dynamics at the Jan. 18 Crystal Ball fundraiser for the Community Foundation of Northwest Mississippi at the Arena at Southaven.\nThe Crystal Ball benefits some 400 nonprofit groups and causes through the Community Foundation, founded in 2002 and serving DeSoto and nine other counties \u2014 Bolivar, Coahoma, Marshall, Panola, Quitman, Sunflower, Tallahatchie, Tate and Tunica.\nLeading off the musical program at the Crystal Ball will be Mark Anderson, resident deejay for the Peabody Rooftop Party series in Memphis, with his \u201cVideo Super Show,\u201d said Pittman."}
