The theme of this year's parade is \"Forever Young.\"\n\nThe port is the title sponsor of the parade, which is often referred to as \"America's Largest Balloon Parade\" because of the number of giant inflatables. There are 28 this year.\n\nThere will also be nine bands, including the USC Trojan and University of Nebraska Cornhusker marching bands. Seven floats and several specialty units will complete the lineup.\n\nThe parade is one of the many activities leading up to the 2014 National University Holiday Bowl game between the USC Trojans and the University of Nebraska Cornhuskers at Qualcomm Stadium at 5 p.m. Saturday.\n\nThe parade will run south along Harbor Drive from the County Administration Building to the corner of Harbor Drive and Pacific Highway, near Seaport Village. Segments of Harbor Drive and Pacific Highway will be closed for the parade starting at 12:45 p.m., and the parade itself starts at 3 p.m.\n\nParade organizers said Waterfront Park at the County Administration Center will be one of the best places from where to watch the procession of balloons. Event organizers are urging visitors to take public transportation as downtown parking will be at a premium.\n\nThe Little Italy trolley stop is located one block east of the Waterfront Park.\n\nNo alcohol or smoking (including e-cigarettes) will be allowed in park areas or along the parade route. Glass and barbecues will not be permitted, but persons may bring picnics, lawn chairs, sunscreen, blankets and canopies.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The parade is often referred to as \"America's Largest Balloon Parade\" because of the number of giant inflatables.
