A Fairview man was killed in a head-on crash in Major County early Saturday morning.

The crash happened on State Highway 60 just before 6 a.m.

According to a report by the Oklahoma Highway Patrol, 22-year-old Dillon Baldwin was driving southbound on US 60 in a 2007 Chevy Monte Carlo when he crossed into the oncoming lane for an unknown reason.

At the same time, George Keck, 60, was headed northbound in a 1996 International 940 dump truck. Keck tried to take evasive action, but was not able to avoid the Monte Carlo and the two collided head-on.

Keck's vehicle departed the roadway to the left and came to rest on the west side of the highway. Baldwin's vehicle stayed on the highway.

Baldwin was pinned inside his vehicle for approximately two hours before being freed by the Fairview Fire Department using the Jaws of Life. He was pronounced dead at the scene. Keck was not injured.

Troopers say Keck was wearing his seatbelt and Baldwin was not. The cause of the crash is still under investigation.
