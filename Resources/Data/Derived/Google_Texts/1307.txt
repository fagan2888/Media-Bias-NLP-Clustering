Starting in January, a new Category I Current Procedural Terminology code will be used with the Ex-Press glaucoma filtration device, according to a press release from Alcon.

The American Medical Association assigned CPT code 66183 to the device with the description, “insertion of anterior segment aqueous drainage device, without extraocular reservoir; external approach.”

This code is to be used for dates of service on or after Jan. 1, 2014, and will replace the Category III CPT code 0192T, the release said.
