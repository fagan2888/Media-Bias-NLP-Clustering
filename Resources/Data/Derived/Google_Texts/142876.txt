Fireworks resellers are finished selling for this season but their remaining inventory will get stored away for next year or shipped to other states.

"It's been another successful season for us. Seems like last night everything went pretty smooth," said Jacob Marietta Wholesale Fireworks Manager

Today, staff and volunteers packed up the remaining fireworks that were not sold this season.

"All this stuff that's opened up, we'll box up, and ship down to our year round stores in other areas. If the case never got opened, it'll go back into our controlled storage for next year," said Marietta.

He advises people to store away unused fireworks in boxes that are labeled and keep them off the ground.

"Put them on a shelf in the garage. Think of it kind of like paint. They're not a dangerous explosive but they are still a flammable item," he said.

Marietta already has plans to go to China to buy fireworks for next year.
