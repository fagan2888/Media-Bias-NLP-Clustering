If so we will not know for quite sometime as we will need to send a sub the ocean's floor to find out.Axial Seamount is located about 300 miles from the coast of Oregon. Scientists predicted this volcano to start erupting sometime this year and it looks like it may have already happened.\"It was an astonishing experience to see the changes taking place 300 miles away with no one anywhere nearby,\" said John Delaney, a University of Washington oceanography professor. \"The data flowed back to land at the speed of light through the fiber-optic cable connected to Pacific City - and from there, to here on campus by the Internet, in milliseconds.\"He was referencing custom built pressure sensors located at the bottom of the Pacific in this region.\n\nThe area has been experiencing small earthquakes for quite sometime, which is a sign that magma may have made its way toward the surface. Also the sea floor has dropped nearly eight feet, another indication that magma has been moving places.\n\n\n\nScientists expect to visit this volcano this summer to see if an eruption had occurred. There is no threat to land from this eruption.\n\n\n\nCopyright 2015 Tucson News Now.
