In addition to meeting all Minimum Essential Coverage requirements stipulated in the Affordable Care Act, it addresses the majority of health care needs that people will encounter, such as treatment of coughs and colds, diabetes, asthma, pain and injury, and other common ailments.\n\nRWC Group, an International commercial truck dealership focused on sales, parts and service, employs more than 600 people in Arizona, Washington, California and Alaska. It needed a health care solution that was easy for employees to navigate and helped lower claims and overall costs. The company opted for Redirect Health\u2019s CareLogistics\u2122 plan to complement a United Healthcare premium plan. When RWC employees need care, they can contact the CareLogistics team 24/7/365 to speak with a CareLogistics specialist who quickly evaluates healthcare needs, collects necessary patient information and identifies the most efficient and cost-effective route for treatment. The plan helps employees stay healthy while assuring superior performance and employee satisfaction.\n\n\"I've been concerned about my employees\u2019 health care plans and their increasing costs,\" said RWC Group Founder and CEO Bob Cunningham. \u201cRedirect Health not only has provided the care my employees need, but the CareLogistics\u2122 process helps them better navigate the system and reduces the amount of time they\u2019ll be away from work when health care issues arise. Plus, the health care savings are even serving as a recruiting tool. We can actually use Redirect Health to expand our business.\u201d\n\nWith the new plan, Redirect Health predicts RWC Group will save between 5 and 15 percent of total health care claims costs.\n\nRedirect Health recently provided RWC Group with a free, on-site health screening clinic at its Arizona headquarters. Employees received glucose, cholesterol and blood pressure checks, as well as flu shots, from the convenience of their workplace.\n\n\u201cWe make healthcare work for businesses, providing an outrageous advantage to entrepreneurial organizations that think they can\u2019t afford the quality care their employees need,\u201d said Redirect Health Co-founder Dr. Janice Johnston, who provided medical services at the recent clinic. \"Our CareLogistics team essentially provides employees with a doctor in their pocket, reducing some 60 percent of in-person visits.\u201d\n\nRedirect Health\u2019s CareLogistics plan costs $35 a month per employee, while the company\u2019s EverydayCare plans start at less than $100 a month per employee \u2013 a cost that can be covered by the business or employee. Redirect Health is able to keep costs low without sacrificing the quality of care because it \u2018redirects\u2019 a patient\u2019s health care to find the most efficient and cost-effective services available. When patients need basic care, they contact a Redirect Health CareLogistics specialist who can quickly evaluate their needs and identify the most effective and efficient route for treatment. For instance, a procedure that costs significantly more at a hospital can be redirected to a nearby clinic for a fraction of the cost, resulting in significant savings.\n\nThis video explains how Redirect Health enables employers to provide compliant, high-quality health care for as little as $0 a month.\n\nCompanies interested in exploring EverydayCareTM can call (888) 995-4945 or email nextsteps@redirecthealth.com.
