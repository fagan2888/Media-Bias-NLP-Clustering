Critics of the law say it is meant to legalize discrimination against LGBT individuals, overruling laws that ban discrimination against them in business decisions.\n\nRepublican supporters of RFRA defended themselves against these accusations by pointing out that the law does not mention any specific groups or religions. And it\u2019s precisely this loophole that Bill Levin, a resident of Indianapolis, hopes to exploit with his new enterprise: the First Church of Cannabis.\n\n\n\nofficial MintPress sponsor official MintPress sponsor\n\nBy claiming that smoking marijuana is a sacrament, Levin, the church\u2019s founder, hopes to circumvent state and federal laws banning its use by allowing members to smoke pot during services. Under RFRA, the state can only take actions which \u201csubstantially burden\u201d a person\u2019s religious expression \u201cif it can demonstrate that it is the least restrictive means of furthering a compelling governmental interest.\u201d\n\nLevin and his flock are renting space in an abandoned church, using funds raised through an Internet crowdfunding site, and plan to hold their first services next month.\n\n\u201cSome neighbors said they aren\u2019t too sure about the new church and think it is just a place to smoke dope,\u201d wrote Jade Hindmon and Derrik Thomas for The Indy Channel.\n\nFor his part, Levin insists the church is based on genuine religious faith.\n\n\u201cThis is what I live by, and I have more faith in this religion than any other,\u201d Levin told the Indianapolis Star. \u201cThis is my lifestyle. This is millions of people\u2019s lifestyle.\u201d\n\nAccording to Levin, the church does not worship cannabis, but uses it as a way to spread love. The church has outlined 12 commandments for worship, including a directive to never be a troll on the Internet. Worshippers are also told: \u201cDon\u2019t be an asshole. Treat everyone with love, as an equal.\u201d\n\nThe IRS seems to agree that the Church of Cannabis is legitimate, at least enough to qualify for nonprofit status. \u201cOur NOT FOR PROFIT 501 C3 status came in today\u2026 WE ARE 100 % a LEGAL CHURCH\u2026 All say HALLELUJAH and SMILE REAL BIG!\u2026 We are OFFICIAL!\u201d announced Levin on the church\u2019s Facebook page on May 26.\n\nEarlier this month, Levin told Yahoo! News that while members will not be allowed to \u201cbuy, sell or trade\u201d the plant, the church will be a \u201csafe zone\u201d for its use. He also described his plans for opening day:\n\n\u201cLevin, who has crafted titles for himself like Grand Pooh-bah and Minister of Love, described the upcoming service as a beautiful and moving \u2018celebration of life\u2019s great adventure.\u2019\n\n\u2018We\u2019re going to do all the good things that churches do. Celebrate life, love, compassion and good health,\u2019 Levin said. \u2018Everyone is going to leave in a happy, spiritual, healthy way.\u2019\u201d\n\nWatch the local RTV6 news report on the First Church Of Cannabis\u2019 opening:\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "In addition to treating cannabis as a sacrament, the church\u2019s commandments include respecting one\u2019s body, other people, and nature, and opposing trolls and bullying on the Internet.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "AUTHOR": "Kit O'Connell", "og": {"site_name": "MintPress News", "description": "In addition to treating cannabis as a sacrament, the church\u2019s commandments include respecting one\u2019s body, other people, and nature, and opposing trolls and bullying on the Internet.", "title": "First Church Of Cannabis To Open, Challenging Drug War And Religious Freedom Law", "url": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/first-church-of-cannabis-to-open-challenging-drug-war-and-religious-freedom-law/206512/", "image": "https://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/IndianaAntiGayLaw-FirstChurchofCannabis.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-06-16T08:12:21-05:00", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "In addition to treating cannabis as a sacrament, the church\u2019s commandments include respecting one\u2019s body, other people, and nature, and opposing trolls and bullying on the Internet.", "creator": "@KitOConnell", "image": "https://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/IndianaAntiGayLaw-FirstChurchofCannabis.jpg", "title": "First Church Of Cannabis To Open, Challenging Drug War And Religious Freedom Law", "site": "@MintPressNews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"admins": 100003161352196}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/MintpressNewsMPN", "published_time": "2015-06-12T08:29:10-05:00", "author": "http://facebook.com/kitoconnell", "section": "Front Page: National", "modified_time": "2015-06-16T08:12:21-05:00", "tag": "RFRA"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb7c8\"", "article_summary": "First Church Of Cannabis To Open, Challenging Drug War And Religious Freedom LawIn addition to treating cannabis as a sacrament, the church\u2019s commandments include respecting one\u2019s body, other people, and nature, and opposing trolls and bullying on the Internet.\nRFRA is a state law that prevents residents, churches and businesses from being prosecuted for actions relating to a sincerely held religious belief.\n\u201cThis is what I live by, and I have more faith in this religion than any other,\u201d Levin told the Indianapolis Star.\nINDIANAPOLIS \u2014 On July 1, the same day Indiana\u2019s controversial Religious Freedom Restoration Act, or RFRA, goes into effect, the First Church Of Cannabis will open its doors in the state.\n\u2018Everyone is going to leave in a happy, spiritual, healthy way.\u2019\u201dWatch the local RTV6 news report on the First Church Of Cannabis\u2019 opening:"}
