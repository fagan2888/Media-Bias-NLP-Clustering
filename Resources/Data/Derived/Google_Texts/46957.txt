Pope Francis will arrive in D.C. on Sept. 22 for a two-day visit with President Obama. His itinerary will also include a catholic mass, a joint address to Congress and a stop-by at religious sites around the District.

Increased security, crowds of tourists and traffic jams are expected for the duration of his trip, and that is the reason why the federal government suggested its employees work from home during the pontiff’s stay in D.C.

According to WTOP:

In a memo from the Office of Personnel Management, Acting Director Beth Cobert asked agencies to let their employees telecommute as a way of avoiding the crowds. If employees must come in, Cobert recommends that they add extra travel time to get to and from the office. “Employees are encouraged to monitor local news media for announcements on street closures for vehicular and pedestrian traffic, closures or disruptions to public transportation, building closures, or any possible changes to the Washington, D.C. area Federal Government operating status,” the memo says.

Aka, “the Pope made me late” excuse isn’t going to work.

The Washington Post reported:

The pope’s visit is expected to attract tens of thousands of people to the Capitol area during his speech, and many more on the Mall. The government is bracing for big logistics challenges. Businesses and nonprofits often follow the government’s lead’s on weather-related closings. The telework arrangements won’t be exactly the same as snow days, though. Often the government closes in bad weather, giving federal workers a day off they would otherwise not have to take.
