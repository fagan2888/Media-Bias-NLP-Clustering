So much so, his family says he practices DIY health care.\n\nIn a McFadden television ad called \u201cStitches\u201d airing widely in Minnesota, McFadden\u2019s son says his father removed his stitches because he thought it cost too much.\n\n\u201cWhen I was 10, and had to get stitches out after a hockey injury, the nurse said it would cost $100,\u201d Conor McFadden said. \u201cDad was so horrified, he grabbed the scissors and took them out himself!\u201d\n\n\u201cYou lived!\u201d responds Mike McFadden, with a smile.\n\nMedical experts say it\u2019s not a good idea for parents to practice their own suture removal, and McFadden\u2019s not recommending it, either.\n\n\u201cNo McFadden children were harmed in the making of the ad,\u201d Tom Erickson, McFadden\u2019s campaign spokesman, said.\n\n\u201cWe are in no way encouraging other parents to do the same. That decision is best left to parents in consultation with medical professionals. We\u2019re simply highlighting how simple procedures can have big price tags,\u201d he said.\n\nMcFadden is right about the cost of a suture procedure \u2014 sort of.\n\nThere\u2019s a wide range of price tags for getting stitches and getting stitches removed.\n\nMost of it covered by insurance\n\nNational health care surveys reveal the cost of emergency room stitches can be thousands of dollars, but getting them removed is not.\n\nIn Minnesota the costs are as follows:\n\n$99 at a Minute Clinic\n\n$135 at United Family Health Care in St. Paul\n\n$150 at Park Nicollet Hospital in Minneapolis\n\nMcFadden says his ad is a metaphor for the high cost of health care.\n\nHe proposes to repeal and replace \u201cObamacare\u201d.\n\nHe doesn\u2019t say how, but he\u2019d like to keep the popular programs.\n\n\u201cThe replacement would ensure that pre-existing conditions are covered, that children can stay on their parents plans until the age of 26, includes a ban on lifetime limits and give states more power to tackle healthcare reform in the ways that\u2019s best for their residents,\u201d Erickson said.\n\nIn addition to keeping the most popular programs in the new health care law, McFadden says he would not repeal the controversial Medicaid expansion, which covers the poorest Americans.\n\n\u201cEliminating the Medicaid expansion would create a huge budget problem for the states that chose to expand it for their citizens,\u201d said Erickson. \u201cMike has no plan to leave them high and dry.\u201d\n\nNo word on a new McFadden \u201cstitches\u201d program, which is covered by federal health care laws, sometimes with a small co-pay.\n\nThat\u2019s Reality Check.\n\n\u2014\n\nHere are some the sources we used for this Reality Check:\n\nMike McFadden for US Senate\n\nhttp://www.mikemcfadden.com/smarter-solution-health-care/\n\nMcFadden TV ad \u201cStitches\u201d\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7ivJegFF3E\n\nCost of Medical Procedures by Region\n\nhttp://health.costhelper.com/emergency-room.html\n\nMinute Clinic Price List\n\nhttp://www.cvs.com/minuteclinic/insurance-and-billing/price-lists\n\n$500 a Stitch: New York Times\n\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/03/health/as-hospital-costs-soar-single-stitch-tops-500.html?pagewanted=all", "article_metadata": {"description": "Minnesota's GOP U.S. Senate candidate Mike McFadden is a hands-on guy.
