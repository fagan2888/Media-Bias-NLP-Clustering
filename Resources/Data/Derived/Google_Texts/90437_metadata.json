Steve Cohen, a Tennessee Democrat, took to the House floor to pay homage to Minnie Minoso, the major leagues\u2019 first black player from Latin America, who died Sunday.\n\nAs the Supreme Court mulled whether to yank Obamacare coverage from six million Americans Wednesday, a brief but poignant tale spun out nearby about a little boy with polio and his baseball hero.\n\nRep. Steve Cohen, a Tennessee Democrat who represents Memphis, took to the House floor to pay homage to Minnie Minoso, the major leagues\u2019 first black player from Latin America, who died Sunday.\n\nMinoso was an almost iconic figure in Chicago after starting his American career with the all-black New York Cubans, who played in Paterson, N.J. He was from Cuba and known as \u201cthe Cuban Comet.\u201d\n\nMinoso wound up playing parts of five decades and made seven All-Star teams. Nobody's quite sure of his age but he was probably in his 90s. But, for certain, he played an exhibition came in Memphis in 1955 while with the White Sox.\n\nCohen was a young Sox fan who was on crutches and recovering from polio. As he recalled Wednesday, he was wearing a Sox cap and t-shirt and getting autographs before the game when a white player came up and gave him a baseball.\n\nHe told his dad who was elsewhere in the stands. The dad told him to go back and thank the player. When he did, the Sox pitcher said to thank \u201cthat player over there,\u201d pointing to Minoso, the lone black among the White Sox and St. Louis Cardinals.\n\n\u201cIn segregated Memphis a black player didn\u2019t feel comfortable\u201d giving a ball to a white kid, Cohen recalled, and thus had asked his teammate to bring it to the boy on crutches.\n\n\u201cIt taught me about the horrors of discrimination, prejudice and racism,\u201d said Cohen.\n\nMinoso became his friend and they\u2019d visit when the team came to Memphis and Minoso had to stay at an all-black hotel.\n\nYears later, after Cohen had moved to Los Angeles, Minoso saw Cohen\u2019s dad at a Dodgers game and asked, \u201cDoc, how\u2019s the kid\u2019s leg?\u201d\n\nHolding back a tear, the congressman, now 65, concluded, \u201cI\u2019ll miss Minnie Minoso. He\u2019s a lesson why sports are more important than runs, hits and errors. Thank you, Minnie.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.thumb": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.2137068.1425486550!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/split-potomac-0304.jpg", "description": "Rep.
