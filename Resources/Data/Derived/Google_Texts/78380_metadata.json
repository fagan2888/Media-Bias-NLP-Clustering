There were fights between protesters and an unforgiving hotel security team, accompanied by cries of \u201cSieg Heil\u201d directed at Black Lives Matter protesters. There was, of course, Trump himself, who repeatedly called reporters \u201cdishonest\u201d and said they were \u201cthe worst.\u201d He egged on his supporters to direct hostile jeers at those of us in the media pen.\n\nMake no mistake, a Trump rally circa 2015 is the closest one will come to recreating the ugliness of a George Wallace rally from 1968 \u2014 the heated emotions, the embittered supporters battling it out with protesters, and the angry candidate fueling the crowd. The hatred, alienation, and polarization are palpable; and so too is the feeling that you\u2019re on the knife\u2019s edge of a political explosion.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut there is another side to Trump that merits greater attention \u2014 fear.\n\nThis is not the fear of \u201cothers\u201d \u2014 immigrants, Muslims, etc. There is plenty of that, but in talking to Trump\u2019s supporters, a different kind of fear emerges \u2014 a sense that the country is falling apart, that the nation\u2019s safety and security are at risk, and that America needs someone who is strong, decisive, and unafraid to say what he thinks must be done to fix things.\n\nGranted, plenty of that fear is manufactured too, but it\u2019s a fear that must be fully reckoned with if one wants to understand why Trump has become such a political force.\n\nOne must be careful in drawing too many conclusions from interviews with those who show up at a political rally. But among the two dozen voters I spoke to, several recurrent themes emerged.\n\nMany, surprisingly, seemed either troubled by Trump\u2019s attacks on Muslims and Hispanics or worried that he\u2019d perhaps gone too far. One man spoke about growing up in Southern California alongside Mexican-Americans and being concerned by some of Trump\u2019s attacks. Another woman said she felt terrible for the \u201cinnocent Muslims\u201d in America who are being targeted. But for all of them, these concerns take a back seat to safety \u2014 and a belief that the country can do a better job of weeding out the bad seeds from the overwhelming number of good ones.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAny reservations about Trump\u2019s tactlessness and outrageousness are more than outweighed by the reassurance that comes from Trump\u2019s willingness to do and say things that aren\u2019t politically correct.\n\nTo this point, if I didn\u2019t know better, I would have thought that the campaign handed out talking points to supporters; when asked what they liked about Trump, they all had the same answer. \u201cHe speaks his mind,\u201d \u201che says what he thinks,\u201d and he says what many of them are thinking. As one man said, \u201cHe says all the things that I\u2019ve been yelling at the TV for the past seven years.\u201d Even though Trump has been caught in lie after lie, his backers said they liked his \u201chonesty.\u201d One woman even called his candor \u201crefreshing.\u201d\n\nThe brashness, the indifference to facts that breeds such media scrutiny of Trump \u2013 and such fear from many \u2014 are precisely what his backers love about him.\n\nIn fact, the more Trump is excoriated, the more it plays to this particular strength. If there is one article of faith for Trump supporters it is that the political system is hopelessly corrupt. Trump, because he\u2019s so rich, \u201ccan\u2019t be bought,\u201d and because he is incorruptible he can say \u2014 and potentially do \u2014 the things the need to get it done, no matter who it might offend. He might have an \u201cagenda,\u201d one woman said, but it\u2019s \u201chis agenda, not the special interests\u2019.\u201d\n\nTrump played on this theme in his remarks as he decried the Republican politicians who say they are going to end Obamacare, but \u201ctotally change their tune\u201d when they get to Washington.\n\n\u201cI promise you this,\u201d said Trump, \u201cPresident Trump will never change his tune\u201d \u2014 a line that was met with raucous applause.\n\nBut, in the end, it is Trump\u2019s pledge to \u201cmake America great again\u201d and to make the American Dream \u201cbigger and better and stronger\u201d that is the core of his appeal. In a time of uncertainty and anxiety, when his overwhelmingly white supporters feel alienated from not just the political system, but also from the political party they call home, Trump speaks to them. It is the language of nostalgia, it\u2019s an ideology of preservatism, and a harking back to a time when politicians weren\u2019t \u201cstupid people,\u201d the Chinese, the Mexicans, and the Japanese weren\u2019t \u201crobbing us blind,\u201d and America was \u201cnot so lost as a country.\u201d\n\nWayne Allyn Root, a local radio personality who opened up for Trump, declared in a fiery speech that the GOP front-runner would \u201csave the greatest nation in world history.\u201d It was a fitting reminder that intense patriotism goes a long way to explaining Trump\u2019s rise.\n\nAll of this is an explanation of Trump\u2019s appeal, but it certainly doesn\u2019t excuse it. Racism and xenophobia (both explicit and implicit) are helping drive his poll numbers ever higher. This is without question. But that doesn\u2019t tell the whole story.\n\nUnderneath the ugliness is, amazingly, an aspirational message and a notion that Trump, uncorrupted and unafraid to say what needs to be said, is the only politician who can, yes, make America great again.\n\nMichael A.
