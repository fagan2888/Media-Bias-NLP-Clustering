Since then, he's developed a reputation for not being the hardest worker, especially on Friday afternoons. He says he works until his cases are completed, and \"I'm just as likely to leave at 4 o'clock on a Monday or Tuesday as I am on a Friday. I can only work on the work that's on my desk. Judges aren't elected to punch the clock. They're elected to work their caseload.\"\n\nFeren, 63, has been practicing law for more than 28 years. He came to the bench after a long career as a politician, dating back to 1992 when he was elected to the Florida House of Representatives and four years later, as city commissioner in Sunrise.\n\nJurists are supposed to be exemplary in judgment and temperament. Voters should expect nothing less, given the power a circuit court judge holds. Suffice it to say that neither of these candidates exemplifies the highest ideals expected of a judge.\n\nBut since voters must pick, the Sun Sentinel Editorial Board recommends Feren as the underwhelming favorite. He, at least, has a track record that is consistent, which is more than we can say about Contini, a former prosecutor and criminal defense lawyer.\n\nIn the Group 27 race, there are no stellar choices. Voters are stuck with an undistinguished incumbent in Judge Steven Feren and his quixotic challenger, attorney John Contini. As one courthouse observer put it: \"The public isn't doing well here.\"\n\nBroward County is the 17th Judicial Circuit. Circuit Court judges are a rung above County Court judges and handle serious criminal cases including homicide, burglary and child abuse. They hear civil cases involving more than $15,000. The judges typically serve for long periods in specialized divisions \u2014 such as civil, criminal, family law and probate. All registered voters in the county can vote in these races.\n\nContini, 57, would beg to differ. \"He's the veritable worst in his attendance record. Many of Judge Feren's colleagues will share with you the absenteeism, and the 37 hours he showed up in the month of April. The people of Broward deserve someone who will show up every day. I won't be in some other state in a national poker championship and at the Hard Rock every week.\"\n\nA criminal defense attorney and former state and federal prosecutor, Contini insists his legal background and life experiences \u2014 including as a born-again Christian \u2014 would make him the better judge. He has practiced law for more than 30 years. He worked in the Broward State Attorney's office before joining the U.S. Department of Justice's anti-obscenity task force. He has since worked as a criminal defense attorney. In 2001, he wrote a memoir chronicling his problems with addiction. He told us he stopped drinking this year.\n\nIn the back and forth of this grudge match, Feren accuses Contini of having become a religious bigot, stretching the truth and making injudicious statements on social media \u2014 in support of drug-testing welfare recipients, against Obamacare's \"forced health care for everyone,\" in favor of the Stand Your Ground law, and that \"the answer is in Jesus Christ our Lord.\"\n\nFeren says the only reason he drew a challenger is because another attorney put Contini up to it after receiving an unfavorable ruling.\n\nIn their interview with the editorial board, the two sounded more like reality show combatants than judicial candidates. Amid the accusations, bickering and interruptions, the only thing missing from the conversation was the audience chant, \"Jerry! Jerry! Jerry!\"\n\nIt's hard to get excited about the candidates in Group 27, but given their records and demeanor, it's Feren by a nose, even if you must hold it while voting.\n\nGroup 8: Elect Frantz McLawrence, for his temperament\n\nIt's not very often a judicial race hinges on an \"incident,\" but such is the case with Broward Circuit Judge Lynn Rosenthal, who was appointed to the bench by Gov. Rick Scott in 2012 after Judge Susan Greenhawt resigned.\n\nRosenthal, 57, a former assistant U.S. attorney, showed promise, but a surprising number of attorneys tell us she lacks the measured demeanor expected of a judge. Still, she was the odds-on favorite to win this race, until her arrest in May.\n\nAccording to the police report, Rosenthal struck a concrete median on Interstate 595 on her way to the courthouse. Once there, she hit an unoccupied patrol car while entering the parking lot, and repeatedly drove into the closed gate.\n\nAfter her arrest, a breath test revealed she had no alcohol in her system, but she refused to provide a blood or urine sample for toxicology testing, which was her right. She also requested that her booking photo be shielded from public viewing, another right as a former prosecutor. But as a judge and candidate for re-election, this second request suggested Rosenthal thinks the rules should be different for her.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "oped, editorials, opinion", "og": {"url": "http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/2014-08-14/news/fl-endorsements-broward-circuit-court-20140814_1_judge-feren-john-contini-mayor-feren", "site_name": "tribunedigital-sunsentinel", "type": "article", "description": "Broward County is the 17th Judicial Circuit.
