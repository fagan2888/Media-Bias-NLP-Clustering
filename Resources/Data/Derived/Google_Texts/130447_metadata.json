Sometimes, it\u2019s because a physician has multiple offices, and not all are in network, as in Durocher\u2019s case. Sometimes, it\u2019s because a participating hospital relies on out-of-network doctors, including emergency room physicians, anesthesiologists and radiologists.\n\nConsumer advocates say the sheer scope of such problems undermine promises made by proponents of the Affordable Care Act that the law would protect against medical bankruptcy.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not fair and probably not legal that consumers be left holding the bag when an out-of-network doctor treats them,\u201d said Timothy Jost, a law professor at Washington and Lee University. Jost said it\u2019s a different matter if a consumer knowingly chooses an out-of-network doctor.\n\nDurocher learned only after getting her surgeon\u2019s bill that just one of his two offices participated in her plan and she had chosen the wrong one. She said the doctor\u2019s staff later insisted that they had raised the issue during her initial consultation, but she doesn\u2019t recall that, possibly because she was distracted by her cancer diagnosis.\n\nAdding insult to injury, insurers are not required to count out-of-network charges toward the federal health law\u2019s annual limit on how much of their medical costs patients can be asked to pay out of their own pockets.\n\n[Also: These states had the most Obamacare grants]\n\nEfforts by doctors, hospitals and other health providers to charge patients for bills not covered by their insurers are called \u201cbalance billing.\u201d The problem pre-dates the federal health law and has long been among the top complaints filed with state insurance regulators.\n\nBecause the issue is complex and pits powerful rivals against one another\u2014 among them, hospitals, doctors and insurers\u2014 relatively few states have addressed it. What laws do exist are generally limited to specific situations, such as emergency room care, or certain types of insurance plans, such as HMOs.\n\nThe federal health law largely sidesteps the issue as well. It says insurers must include coverage for emergency care and not charge policyholders higher copayments for ER services at non-network hospitals, because patients can\u2019t always choose where they go. While the insurer will pay a portion of the bill, in such cases, doctors or hospitals may still bill patients for the difference between that payment and their own charges.\n\nThat means that in spite of having insurance, a consumer involved in a car wreck and taken to a non-network hospital might receive additional bills, not just from the hospital, but from the radiologist who read his X-rays, the surgeon who repaired his broken leg and the laboratory that processed his blood tests.\n\nNetworks Get Narrower\n\nAdvocates believe a growing number of consumers are vulnerable to balance billing as insurance networks grow smaller in the bid to hold down costs.\n\nFor example, there were no in-network emergency room physicians or anesthesiologists in some of the hospitals participating in plans offered by three large insurers in Texas in 2013 and 2014, according to a survey of state data by the Center for Public Policy Priorities, a Texas advocacy group.\n\nSmaller networks are also becoming more common in employer-based insurance: About 23 percent of job-based plans had so-called \u201cnarrow networks\u201d in 2012, up from 15 percent in 2007, according to a May report from the Urban Institute and Georgetown University Center on Health Insurance Reforms.\n\n[Also: What CFOs think about revenue cycle]\n\nTo protect consumers, advocacy groups, including Consumers Union and the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network, want regulators to strictly limit balance billing when an insured person gets care in a medical facility that is part of an insurer\u2019s network.\n\n\u201cWithout protection from balance billing, the cost of out-of-network care can be overwhelming,\u201d wrote Consumers Union in a recent letter to the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC), which is updating a model law that states could adopt to regulate insurance networks.\n\nNAIC\u2019S current draft does not directly address the issue of balance billing and consumer efforts have drawn sharp opposition from insurers, hospitals and doctors.\n\nKaiser Health News is a national health policy news service.
