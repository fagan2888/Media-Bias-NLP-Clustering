That\u2019s a problem because increasing legal immigration is one of the major planks of the \u201cimmigration reform\u201d plan of both parties.\n\nEveryone used to agree that immigration was a good thing. But that was before they saw photos of gang members slumped in their gyms and buses full of illegal aliens in Homeland Security convoys coming to hike up their taxes while lowering their property values.\n\nAnd then immigration suddenly stopped being a Neil Diamond song and became a national crisis.\n\nAmerica is developing an anti-immigration consensus. That wasn\u2019t supposed to happen in the nation of immigrants. Media outlets are shaking their heads over the poll numbers and correctly tying them to the border crisis. What they aren\u2019t saying though is that the border crisis was calculatedly set off by Obama\u2019s illegal alien DREAM amnesty. And as with ObamaCare, the radical agenda backfired.\n\nThe border crisis was supposed to start the amnesty machine. It was the sort of confrontational activism popular with Chicago community organizers who know that if you can\u2019t get what you want, you dump a bunch of people on the doorstep of whatever agency you want to blackmail which creates an instant social services mess so that the politicians will have no choice but to \u201csolve the problem\u201d on your terms.\n\nThe harassment of politicians by illegal alien activists took Chicago community organizing to the national level. The border crisis was the next phase of the assault aimed at hitting Americans right where they lived by turning every state into a border state. But the rest of the United States isn\u2019t Chicago. Or at least not the parts of Chicago that community organizers like.\n\nCrowds waving American flags blocked buses. Stories leaked out about diseases being spread around. Even Democrats did their best to keep the illegal alien drops out of their states.\n\nThe border crisis was meant to move Americans toward an even more liberal position on illegal immigration. Instead it had the opposite effect and tainted the idea of immigration as a whole.\n\nThe backlash was completely predictable to anyone who had been paying attention to Europe.\n\nThe United States didn\u2019t have an anti-immigration consensus until Obama duplicated the European situation by manufacturing a refugee crisis. Europe developed an anti-immigration consensus when a poor economy collided with large numbers of refugees and a central authority that remained blindly intent on pushing more immigrants and migrants through the system regardless of popular discontent.\n\nDemocrats and Republicans plotted amnesty while dismissing the idea of an anti-immigration consensus. They acted as if the rise of anti-immigration parties like UKIP was a purely European phenomenon and that the American political brass ring would go to the biggest amnesty shill.\n\nNow the polls are telling them that they were wrong.\n\nRepublicans and Democrats had always been selectively reading the polls in favor of amnesty while ignoring the negative polls involving immigrants and the economy. Americans appeared to support legalization because they didn\u2019t care much about illegal aliens. Even Latino voters ranked immigration low on their set of priorities. The passion had always been on the side of immigration opponents.\n\nJust like ObamaCare, an issue that no one had particularly cared about before and for which passionate support was virtually non-existent, Obamnesty became the banner policy of the establishment and that made it possible for the opposition to define the issue through the politics of confrontation.\n\nThe border crisis made immigration seem urgent for the first time by visualizing a massive human tide swarming inside. Now immigration is polling as a priority and not the kind of priority that Obama had in mind. Instead the border crisis has caused immigration to be seen as an economic threat.\n\nObama\u2019s campaigns in 2008 and 2012 had played off isolationism among ordinary Americans while promising multilateral soft power to the elites. Pledges of opposition to the Iraq War in 2008 and the dishonest promises of \u201cNation Building at Home\u201d in 2012 allowed Obama to outmaneuver a moribund Republican political machine that was desperately short of ideas.\n\nBut Obama forgot that isolationism tends to go together with immigration skepticism. Once people decide that the outside world isn\u2019t worth bothering with, their suspicion of international interventions easily transfers over to immigration.\n\nAmerica today has more than a little in common with the period of the great immigration backlash of the 1920s. Economic uncertainty and a period of isolationism after an exhausting foreign war combined with the arrival of huge numbers of immigrants led to an immigration backlash back then. It would not be unprecedented for it to lead to an immigration backlash all over again.\n\nEconomic malaise and political isolationism are just as present in the United States as in Europe. The amnesty push polarized the issue and created a major crisis. Obama took on the role of America\u2019s EU, an internationalist force dedicated to unlimited immigration with no concern for the citizenry.\n\nThe anti-immigration consensus stunned Tories and Labour alike in the UK. Both parties are still reeling from how easily UKIP exploited popular anger over immigration. And both parties have been forced to learn how to talk to working class voters again. If the same political tsunami hits America, Republicans and Democrats will be even more unprepared to deal with a phenomenon that will make the Tea Party disruptions over ObamaCare seem like a fond memory for the political establishment.\n\nThe two big parties are unready to deal with real isolationism. Barack Obama and Rand Paul may flirt with anti-war sloganeering, but they are also committed to amnesty, free trade and open borders.\n\nBoth Democrats and Republicans have made the mistake of trying to trade the white working class voters that they have for the future demographics of a transformed nation. But like their European counterparts they may find that they have prematurely buried the white working class voter.\n\nIsolationism is less of a rejection of the outside world than it is a rejection of the terms on which a domestic political leadership has dealt with the rest of the world. Skepticism toward foreign intervention and immigration are really votes of no confidence in our own government. And that\u2019s what the poll numbers for Obama and Congress have been communicating even before the border crisis.\n\nIn a miserable economy with living standards on the decline and little hope for the future, there is a great deal of free-floating anger in the political atmosphere. The sleeping giant of the coal mines and bars, the rust belt and the drought-plagued farmland may wake to his anger much more slowly than the mobs of migrants who have been community organized into parading back and forth all day in front of government offices waving their fists in the air, but when he wakes up, the political establishment that has gotten used to ignoring him will collapse and fall apart.\n\nThe amnesty radicals pushed too hard and too fast. They could have gotten everything they wanted through a consensus of both parties, but now they may end up with nothing at all.\n\nFreedom Center pamphlets now available on Kindle: Click here.\n\nSubscribe to Frontpage's TV show, The Glazov Gang, and LIKE it on Facebook.", "article_metadata": {"rating": "general", "description": "America's new anti-immigration consensus.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"site_name": "Frontpage Mag", "description": "America's new anti-immigration consensus.", "title": "The Amnesty Radicals' Big Mistake", "url": "http://www.frontpagemag.com/fpm/238312/amnesty-radicals-big-mistake-daniel-greenfield", "updated_time": "2015-06-22T23:44:20-04:00", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.frontpagemag.com/fpm/238312/amnesty-radicals-big-mistake-daniel-greenfield", "description": "America's new anti-immigration consensus.", "card": "summary", "title": "The Amnesty Radicals' Big Mistake"}, "article": {"published_time": "2014-08-11T20:52:41-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-06-22T23:44:20-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd81ab\"", "article_summary": "What they aren\u2019t saying though is that the border crisis was calculatedly set off by Obama\u2019s illegal alien DREAM amnesty.\nMedia outlets are shaking their heads over the poll numbers and correctly tying them to the border crisis.\nThe border crisis was supposed to start the amnesty machine.\nThe border crisis was meant to move Americans toward an even more liberal position on illegal immigration.\nDemocrats and Republicans plotted amnesty while dismissing the idea of an anti-immigration consensus."}
