The Governor and Mayor will read proclamations declaring December 21 as National Homeless Persons\u2019 Memorial Day in the State of Iowa and in the City of Des Moines.\n\nThis event reflects on the lives of those who died homeless and celebrates the community\u2019s continuing commitment toward creating a society without homelessness. It is \u201ca 30 minute experience out in the cold, with the homeless, to remember those who died homeless,\u201d says Joppa founder Joe Stevens.\n\nJoppa organizes the homeless memorial each year to honor, remember and prevent. \u201cIt is important for us to remember those who have died homeless, and honor them as human beings. Many times they lose touch with family members and their relatives don\u2019t even know they\u2019re gone,\u201d said Mr. Stevens. He continued, \u201cWe can also help prevent homeless deaths this winter with contributions for those living in tents, under bridges and in vehicles.\u201d\n\nTo help ease the pain of homelessness, attendees are encouraged to bring coats, hats, gloves, long johns, blankets and financial contributions toward propane heat and winter boots for those living outdoors this winter.\n\nJoppa Outreach is a 501(c)3 non-profit organization reaching unsheltered homeless people in unique ways. Wherever unsheltered people are living, volunteers visit weekly to spend time with them, care for their immediate needs, and ultimately help them get off the streets.\n\nFor more information or to make a donation, please visit JoppaOutreach.org, or call (515) 288-5699 or toll free at (866) 288-5699.", "article_metadata": {"shareaholic": {"site_name": "Caffeinated Thoughts", "language": "en-US", "url": "https://caffeinatedthoughts.com/2014/12/iowa-homeless-memorial-candlelight-vigil-capitol/", "article_author_name": "Shane Vander Hart", "image": "https://caffeinatedthoughts.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/homeless-camp-1024x576.jpg", "site_id": "965f58835b5900850067f65116487024", "article_published_time": "2014-12-18T16:30:25+00:00", "shareable_page": "true", "article_modified_time": "2016-05-25T11:32:47+00:00", "keywords": "events, frank cownie, homelessness, joe stevens, joppa outreach, terry branstad, iowa news & politics", "wp_version": "7.7.1.0"}, "description": "December 21 a candlelight vigil, remembering those who have died homeless in Iowa, will be held at 5:30p on the West Capitol Terrace at the State Capitol.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Caffeinated Thoughts", "description": "December 21 a candlelight vigil, remembering those who have died homeless in Iowa, will be held at 5:30p on the West Capitol Terrace at the State Capitol.", "title": "Iowa Homeless Memorial - A Candlelight Vigil at the Capitol | Caffeinated Thoughts", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://caffeinatedthoughts.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/homeless-camp-1024x576.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-12-18T10:30:26-05:00", "url": "https://caffeinatedthoughts.com/2014/12/iowa-homeless-memorial-candlelight-vigil-capitol/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "December 21 a candlelight vigil, remembering those who have died homeless in Iowa, will be held at 5:30p on the West Capitol Terrace at the State Capitol.", "title": "Iowa Homeless Memorial - A Candlelight Vigil at the Capitol | Caffeinated Thoughts", "image": "https://caffeinatedthoughts.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/homeless-camp.jpg", "creator": "@shanevanderhart", "site": "@CaffThoughts", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 259594777484510}, "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/CaffThoughts", "published_time": "2014-12-18T10:30:25-05:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/shanevanderhart", "section": "Iowa News & Politics", "modified_time": "2014-12-18T10:30:26-05:00", "tag": "Terry Branstad"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdea2e\"", "article_summary": "This sixth annual homeless memorial will be a time of reflection that includes music, poetry and prayer.\nIt is \u201ca 30 minute experience out in the cold, with the homeless, to remember those who died homeless,\u201d says Joppa founder Joe Stevens.\nOn Sunday, December 21, people experiencing homelessness will gather with Iowa Governor Branstad, Des Moines Mayor Frank Cownie, homeless service providers, faith-based organizations and the general public to hold a candlelight vigil, remembering those who have died homeless in Iowa, from 5:30 to 6:00 PM, on the West Capitol Terrace at the State Capitol.\nJoppa organizes the homeless memorial each year to honor, remember and prevent.\n\u201cIt is important for us to remember those who have died homeless, and honor them as human beings."}
