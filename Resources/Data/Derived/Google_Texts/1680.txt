Boosie Badazz Half a Kidney Gone in Cancer Surgery

EXCLUSIVE

The surgery Boosie Badazz had to attack his cancer was more severe than anyone knew and way more expensive.

Boosie went under the knife on Tuesday and tells TMZ, the doctors removed half of one of his kidneys. It's called a nephrectomy, and Boosie says it worked like a charm ... docs believe they got all of the cancer.

Boosie says he's still feeling weak 3 days after the surgery, and his wallet's definitely feeling it too. He doesn't have health insurance, so he had to pay $90,000 out-of-pocket!

He feels blessed to have been successful enough that he could foot the life-saving procedure. He's going to be in a cancer rehab facility for at least 3 weeks, but overall ... Boosie calls this a minor setback for a major comeback.
