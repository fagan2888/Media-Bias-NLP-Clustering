On December 11, 1985, Blackfeet Community College received some great news: Accreditation by the Northwest Association of Schools and Colleges. Now the college is celebrating 30 years of accreditation. A celebration was held on December 10 at the Beaver Painted Lodge Student Commons.

Some of the current staff were around in 1985, and remember the laborious task of compiling data for the accreditation application.

“Nearly framed like a historical piece of art, the thick binder remains in the business office today, reminding the college of a job well done,” reads a press release about the anniversary.

BCC is one of 34 nationally accredited tribal colleges and universities. It is located on the Blackfeet Reservation in northwestern Montana.

“Like any college, BCC had its share of growing pains, working hard to increase student enrollment, meet campus facility needs, stabilize funding gaps, and promote vitality through higher education,” says the release. “At this point, BCC can look back and see the growth. The college has grown from scattered classrooms across the reservation to a permanent campus.”

That campus features the first LEED Platinum certified building in Montana, which boasts a state-of-the-art research lab. The college also recently established its first 2+2 baccalaureate program with hybrid/online courses that allow students to take the majority of upper-division classwork at BCC.

“This exciting step sets the stage for campus-wide academic growth, with plans for several baccalaureate degree programs at BCC in the near future,” says the release.
