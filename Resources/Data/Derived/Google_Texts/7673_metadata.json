Taking positions on these controversial topics has made Francis both a hero and a villain (depending on whom you ask), but few of his past positions inspired the sort of ire Francis is sure to receive should he decide to engage in the hotly contested global warming debate.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t appear as though the pope is worried about making friends.\n\nAccording to the Guardian, in 2015 Francis will deliver a message condemning man-made climate change to the world\u2019s 1.2 billion Catholics and will address the General Assembly of the United Nations, where he is expected to call upon world leaders to reduce carbon dioxide production to halt the deadly and immediate effects of global warming.\n\nBishop Marcelo Sorondo, chancellor of the Pontifical Academy of Sciences, says Francis hopes his efforts to combat climate change will directly contribute to action by governments at the global climate meeting to be held in Paris in December 2015.\n\nThe pope should be commended for actively working to make the world a better place and for promoting the long-term sustainability of Earth, but his big climate-change push fails to recognize the overwhelming evidence suggesting immediate catastrophic global warming is not occurring.\n\nFor more than 18 consecutive years, global temperature data show no warming. Roughly 95 percent of all climate models predicting the course of global warming have been proven wrong.\n\nThere has been no long-term trend of rising global sea levels.\n\nThe Palmer Drought Severity Index, which attempts to measure the duration and intensity of long-term drought-inducing circulation patterns, shows no trend since 1895.\n\nAccording to Heartland Institute policy analyst Taylor Smith, the so-called extreme weather of the past two decades is nonexistent. For instance, the number of wildfires has been in decline since at least the 1960s, when wildfires occurred twice as often as they did in 2013. Similarly, the 2013 Atlantic hurricane season witnessed the fewest hurricanes since 1982, and no major hurricanes \u2014 Category 3 or higher \u2014 have made landfall in the continental United States in nine years.\n\nEven claims that sea ice is vanishing are overblown. The Southern Hemisphere\u2019s polar ice cap \u201csurpassed its greatest April extent in recorded history\u201d in 2014.\n\nThe reality is that man-made climate change is simply not the immediate threat Francis seems to believe it is. Before choosing to hitch himself to this horseless wagon, he should consider the detrimental effects climate policies have on poor and developing nations \u2014 those whom the pope has consistently tried to help and defend.\n\nPope Francis is right to be concerned about protecting the environment, and there is solid evidence to suggest that man-made global climate change could present some challenges in the distant future. But the sort of policies the United Nations and like-minded alarmist nations and organizations have proposed will cause far more harm than good, and they almost always ignore evidence that clearly shows imminent catastrophic man-made climate change is not happening.\n\n[Originally published at the Washington Examiner]", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://blog.heartland.org/2015/01/on-climate-change-the-pope-could-use-a-lesson-in-science/", "site_name": "Somewhat Reasonable", "image": "http://blog.heartland.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Picture-1.png", "type": "activity", "title": "On Climate Change, the Pope Could Use a Lesson in Science"}, "robots": "noodp,noydir", "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "The reality is that man-made climate change is simply not the immediate threat Francis seems to believe it is.\nPope Francis is right to be concerned about protecting the environment, and there is solid evidence to suggest that man-made global climate change could present some challenges in the distant future.\nRoughly 95 percent of all climate models predicting the course of global warming have been proven wrong.\nBishop Marcelo Sorondo, chancellor of the Pontifical Academy of Sciences, says Francis hopes his efforts to combat climate change will directly contribute to action by governments at the global climate meeting to be held in Paris in December 2015.\nPope Francis recently made headlines engaging in non-theological matters such as the thawing of relations between the United States and Cuba and income inequality."}
