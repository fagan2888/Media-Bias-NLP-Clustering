It announced the federal deficit has declined to $483 billion, the lowest level since 2007. The deficit had exceeded a trillion dollars each year during the president\u2019s first term.\n\nBut as that news was breaking, the markets embarked on another roller-coaster day, and new polls showed many Americans are skeptical that any economic recovery has trickled down to them.\n\nThat was the setting as I sat down this morning with Treasury Secretary Jack Lew and Budget Director Shaun Donovan.\n\nSecretary Lew and Director Donovan, thank you both for joining us.\n\nYou have some good news for a change today, the deficit down and continuing to go down to, what, 2.8 percent?\n\nJACK LEW, U.S. Treasury Secretary: Correct.\n\nGWEN IFILL: To what do you attribute that?\n\nJACK LEW: Look, I think that if you look at where we were six years ago, we had an economy that was collapsing, we had unemployment, 700,000 jobs lost a month, and we had markets in chaos.\n\nThe president came into office and took tough action. He stabilized the economy. He put in place an economic program to create growth. He put in a program to reform our financial markets and over a period of years worked with Congress on a bipartisan basis to put in place a balanced set of measures to reduce our deficit, starting with the Affordable Care Act, which reduced the deficit, as well as providing a guarantee of health care coverage, and then doing spending reductions and revenue increases that came by making our tax system more fair.\n\nIt\u2019s an enormous amount of progress to have seen the deficit drop by, you know, roughly two-thirds, and to reach a point where it\u2019s \u2014 we\u2019re now in a 10-year period, looking ahead, of sustainable fiscal policy, which is good for the economy. It means that the economy can not worry about crisis to crisis, and the economy can continue to grow. That\u2019s a very good thing.\n\nGWEN IFILL: Director Donovan, you said today that this represents a return to fiscal normalcy. A lot of people don\u2019t feel like their lives are very normal yet again.\n\nSHAUN DONOVAN, Director, Office of Management and Budget: Well, it\u2019s one of the things that I think it\u2019s important for people to recognize.\n\nAs Jack said, we made a lot of progress. We\u2019re now not only below 3 percent of GDP, which is a standard many use as a critical milestone, but we\u2019re actually below the 40-year average for our deficit.\n\nSo when I say we have returned to fiscal normalcy, we have reached a point where we have really stabilized our deficit in an important way. And I think it shouldn\u2019t be lost on the American people that this happened in a year where we moved away from reckless austerity, manufactured crises that had happened on Capitol Hill, to a place where we have been able to have more predictable investments in the economy.\n\nJob growth is growing faster, over 10 million new jobs over the last 55 months. So we have made real progress through the president\u2019s strategy of investing in key things, but we also recognize we have to do more and we have to continue to invest, continue to do that. And that\u2019s what I\u2019m going to be focused on as we go into our budget next year.\n\nGWEN IFILL: But the Congressional Budget Office is \u2014 which is nonpartisan, which is the gold standard in many respects, at least in this world of partisan accusation, they say \u2014 they projected the deficit may start to head back up again in 2016.\n\nJACK LEW: Well, I think if you look at projections over the remainder of this decade, it \u2014 we\u2019re in a pretty stable place in terms of the foundation that we have built.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t mean there\u2019s not more work to do in terms of both growing our economy and investing in the things that we need to do in this country, whether it\u2019s education or infrastructure, to have a strong economic future. And the difference is, we are in a stable place right now, and that is good for the economy.\n\nAnd what we need to concentrate on now is making sure that we maintain the momentum in our economy, so that we don\u2019t return to policies that shortchange the present and the future.\n\nSHAUN DONOVAN: We shouldn\u2019t ignore the fact that the president has been focused on key strategies for the long-term deficit.\n\nJack mentioned the Affordable Care Act. Health care costs are growing at the slowest rate in more than 50 years. You used CBO\u2019s numbers. CBO now projects that in the year 2020, Medicare and Medicaid spending is going to be almost $200 billion lower than they were projecting just a few years ago because of the progress we have made on health care.\n\nGWEN IFILL: If the news is so good, then why is it that everywhere I travel this election year, every poll that I read tells me that people don\u2019t feel it, they don\u2019t trust it, they are still so deeply worried?\n\nYou\u2019re telling them in Washington, things are better, and they\u2019re saying, not in my life.\n\nSHAUN DONOVAN: Well, you know, Gwen, every night, the president reads letters that come from Americans around the country, and he is getting letters from people who have gone back to work because the economy is getting better.\n\nThose more than 10 million new jobs that we have created have made a real difference in people\u2019s lives. I think what you\u2019re hearing as well and the president hears is that, while we have made a lot of progress in our economy, wages aren\u2019t rising, particularly for the middle class, in the way that we would want them to see.\n\nGWEN IFILL: Exactly.\n\nSHAUN DONOVAN: And that\u2019s why we need to make further investments.\n\nThe president has been focused like a laser on the minimum wage and what we can do to increase the minimum wage, to make\u2026\n\nGWEN IFILL: But many of the people who are affected by these wage problems aren\u2019t earning minimum wage. They wouldn\u2019t be affected by that.\n\nSHAUN DONOVAN: But they\u2019re certainly affected, whether they\u2019re construction workers who could increase their wages with new infrastructure projects, whether they could go back and get trained with the investments the president\u2019s proposed, so that they could get a higher-paying job, whether it\u2019s starting with pre-K for kids to make sure that they have the skills to get those higher-paying jobs a generation from now.\n\nHe\u2019s thinking both in the short term and the long term about all the key things we can do to create a stronger economy for the middle class.\n\nGWEN IFILL: Another sign of instability, volatility, whatever you call it, is what we have seen happening in the stock market in the last couple of weeks. And just this morning, the market opened 300 points down almost immediately. By the end of the day, we will see whether it rebounded.\n\nBut does that also makes your job a little bit tougher?\n\nJACK LEW: You know, I think that we focus constantly on, what\u2019s the core economic conditions of the United States.\n\nAnd I think it\u2019s a mistake to look at hour-by-hour movements in markets to get a picture of where the core is. You know, we have seen over the last half-year almost every economic indicator indicating the kind of progress we\u2019re talking about, whether it\u2019s job growth or the growth of the economy and confidence.\n\nI think that we\u2019re on a trajectory that is very strong in terms of maintaining U.S. core economic growth. Obviously, there are challenges in any day of any year that are outside of your control. You know, the president\u2019s policy in 2009, \u201910, \u201911 is a large part of the reason why the United States is now looked at by the world as the economic engine of the world.\n\nAnd, you know, one thing I will say in terms of the question you asked about the kind of public sentiment, the conditions in 2009 were really bad, and it leaves some bruising that takes some time to get over. I think right now, we have been in an extended period where Washington hasn\u2019t been getting to the brink of a crisis, where they\u2019re seeing the economy begin to grow.\n\nAnd our job is to continue that, which is why it\u2019s so important that Washington do its job in an orderly way and that we continue one step after another to make the right decisions.\n\nGWEN IFILL: Secretary of the Treasury Jack Lew and Director of the Office of Management Budget Shaun Donovan, thank you both very much.\n\nJACK LEW: Thank you.\n\nSHAUN DONOVAN: Thank you.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Worries about Ebola, Europe and the U.S. economy drove another dive on Wall Street.
