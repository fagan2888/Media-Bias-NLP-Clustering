It\u2019s a question before a federal judge trying to weigh a Colorado-chartered bank\u2019s attempt to force the U.S. Federal Reserve to let those pot shops access the nation\u2019s banking system.\n\nThe case involves Fourth Corner Credit Union, which Colorado set up last year to serve the marijuana industry.\n\nFederal banking regulators have issued guidelines for how banks can accept money from pot sales, but banks frequently say those guidelines are unwieldy. That leaves many pot shops stuck trying to pay bills and taxes in cash.\n\nNo major marijuana-related cash heists have been reported in Colorado, but the cash-intense nature of the pot industry leaves many in the business feeling nervous about operating in cash. Many Colorado marijuana businesses use armed security.\n\n\u201cThe public is at risk in having hundreds of millions of dollars of cash flowing about the streets of Colorado,\u201d the credit union argued in a court filing last summer.\n\nFourth Corner aimed to solve the dilemma by catering to marijuana-related businesses, filing all the reports federal regulators say should be required of the pot industry. Because marijuana remains illegal under federal law, those who handle proceeds from pot sales could be implicated in a federal racketeering case if they don\u2019t follow the guidelines.\n\nBut the U.S Federal Reserve, a private entity that nonetheless acts as the government\u2019s fiscal agent, is standing in Fourth Corner\u2019s way. The Federal Reserve says that despite guidance about pot banking from the Department of Treasury, pot money simply can\u2019t be allowed into the nation\u2019s central banking system as long as the drug remains illegal under federal law.\n\nThe credit union \u201cwas formed with the intent to serve a federally illegal purpose,\u201d the regional Federal Reserve argued in one of its court filings.\n\nThe Federal Reserve also argued that Congress, and not a federal judge, must decide whether pot money can join the nation\u2019s banking system.\n\n\u201cFederal legislators have introduced multiple relevant bills that would address the issues,\u201d the Federal Reserve argues. \u201cThe Court should abstain from doing so.\u201d\n\nU.S. District Judge R. Brooke Jackson hears arguments in the case Monday morning. He has no deadline for making a decision.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nKristen Wyatt can be reached at http://www.twitter.com/APkristenwyatt", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Colorado pot banking case tests federal drug rules", "title": "Colorado pot banking case tests federal drug rules", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/12/27/colorado-pot-banking-case-tests-federal-drug-rules/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151227__USMarijuanaBanking2.jpg", "height": 436}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151227__USMarijuanaBanking2.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2015-12-27T12:32:23+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-19T19:44:36+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Marijuana Business, Marijuana Colorado"}, "article_summary": "The Federal Reserve also argued that Congress, and not a federal judge, must decide whether pot money can join the nation\u2019s banking system.\nDENVER (AP) \u2014 A marijuana banking case set for arguments Monday is testing the federal government\u2019s stated goal of addressing the cash-only nature of the quasi-legal pot industry.\n\u201cFederal legislators have introduced multiple relevant bills that would address the issues,\u201d the Federal Reserve argues.\nBut should pot sellers be able to use the nation\u2019s banking system as long as marijuana is an illegal drug?\nFederal banking regulators have issued guidelines for how banks can accept money from pot sales, but banks frequently say those guidelines are unwieldy."}
