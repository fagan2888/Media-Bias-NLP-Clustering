According to Florida Highway Patrol, 38-year-old Richard Elder was speeding while heading west on SR 30.

Elder swerved into the eastbound lane where he struck six cars.

Debris from that major collision struck an additional car, and then the impact of one of those collisions also caused one of the vehicles to hit the eighth car.

Elder was critically injured and taken to the hospital.

At this time Florida Highway Patrol is investigating the accident and says charges are pending.
