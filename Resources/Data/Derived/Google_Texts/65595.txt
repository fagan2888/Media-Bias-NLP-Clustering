The Center for Consumer Information and Insurance Oversight (CCIIO) has published a new manual that explains how health insurers and benefit plan administrators should calculate and pay federal reinsurance program bills.

The 55-page guide, "2015 ACA Transitional Reinsurance Program: Annual Enrollment and Contributions Submission Form Manual," Version 1.0, explains how insurers, and independent administrators of self-insured employer plans, can make Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) reinsurance program payments for 2015.
