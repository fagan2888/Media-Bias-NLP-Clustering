Over the years, that grew into a homeless shelter providing meals and health care, offering summer school programs for children and ministering to area residents.\n\n\u201cI see people changing their lives right here,\u201d Beckstein said at his 92nd birthday party last year. \u201cThis is not church, but we lift Jesus up all the time.\u201d\n\nLilly, who described Beckstein as \u201cthe face and main drive\u201d of Good News, said he believes \u201cGod has placed (the Oropezas) at (Good News) at this time for something very special that only they could get done for God.\u201d\n\nThe couple arrived in Gainesville 16 years ago to start a Hispanic ministry at an area church.\n\n\u201cMy kids and I started coming (to Good News) one day a month to volunteer serving food,\u201d Beth Oropeza said. \u201cI always felt I was supposed to be doing something more over here, but I didn\u2019t have the opportunity yet.\u201d\n\nShe said that, having a master\u2019s degree in social work, \u201cin a lot of ways, this job fits me well. This is the kind of thing I\u2019ve always wanted to do.\u201d\n\nAs for the task ahead, \u201cwe\u2019re excited but a little overwhelmed,\u201d Beth said. \u201cIt\u2019s such an amazing place.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to fill (Beckstein\u2019s) shoes,\u201d Alejandro said.\n\n\u201cBut there is so much community support for Good News, and that\u2019s exciting also,\u201d Beth said.\n\nVolunteers: Those interested in volunteering at or donating to Good News at Noon can call 770-503-1366 or visit goodnewsatnoon.org", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.gainesvilletimes.com/archives/112577/", "image": "http://media.morristechnology.com/webmedia/upload/gainesville/article/2015/10/04/1005good2.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Alejandro and Beth Oropeza aren\u2019t replacing just any ministry\u2019s founder.", "title": "Gainesville couple heading up Good News ministry efforts"}, "twitter": {"site": "@gtimes", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noarchive", "title": "Gainesville couple heading up Good News ministry efforts"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcaad8\"", "article_summary": "In an interview Sunday afternoon at the ministry, the couple talked about their plans for Good News and how they arrived at the ministry.\n\u201cOur hope is to take Mr. B\u2019s vision ... and make Good News an even better place,\u201d Beth Oropeza said.\n\u201cMy kids and I started coming (to Good News) one day a month to volunteer serving food,\u201d Beth Oropeza said.\nThe Oropezas, hired to replace the retired Beckstein, began their work as Good News\u2019 new directors last week.\nBeth Oropeza said the couple hopes to spend the next three months learning about operations from Thomas Ramirez, who is in charge of the shelter\u2019s daily functions."}
