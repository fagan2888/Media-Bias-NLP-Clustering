This year, the two winners of the Student Stowe Prize crafted essays on two issues that are very important in 2014.\n\nMadeline Sachs, a high school student from Chicago, spoke on the inequity of juvenile sentencing standards, an issue that\u2019s important as Connecticut lawmakers grapple with -- and still fail to implement -- a new law to come into compliance with a Supreme Court ruling on the issue. We hear some of her presentation and talk with a civil rights lawyer.\n\nDonya Nasser grew up seeing politics and women\u2019s role in politics through the lens of her mother, who grew up in Iran\u2019s very restrictive political system. She\u2019s making the case for more young American women to get involved, and we talk to a political scientist about the issue.\n\nWe also hear the music of Yovianna Garc\u00eda. She\u2019s a young Puerto Rican guitarist who concentrates on the contemporary and traditional sounds of her home country.\n\nVisit Yovianna Garc\u00eda's website for more information and dates of upcoming performances.\n\nVisit WNPR's SoundCloud page to hear Student Stowe Prize recipient Donya Nasser share an inspiring story about her mom.\n\nGUESTS:\n\nSandra Staub - Legal Director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Connecticut\n\n- Legal Director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Connecticut Adrienne Fulco - Associate Professor of Legal and Policy Studies at Trinity College\n\n- Associate Professor of Legal and Policy Studies at Trinity College Yovianna Garc\u00eda - Classical guitarist", "article_metadata": {"category": "Politics", "description": "Each year, the Harriet Beecher Stowe Center honors people whose writing advances social justice and inspires action.
