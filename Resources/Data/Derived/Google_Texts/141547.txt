Omaha, N.E.

Nebraska and South Dakota officials will be discussing what actions to take following the discovery of an invasive zebra mussel on a boat dock on the South Dakota side of Lewis and Clark Lake.



The Missouri River impoundment straddles the state line in northeast Nebraska and southeast South Dakota.



A single adult zebra mussel was discovered on Nov. 14. A subsequent search found no other zebra mussels. Nebraska Game and Parks and South Dakota Game, Fish and Parks staffers have sampled the lake yearly for zebra mussel larvae, and all samples have been negative.



Zebra mussels can attach themselves to pipes or other structures, damaging boat motors and reducing the ability to draw water into facilities such as water treatment and power plants.
