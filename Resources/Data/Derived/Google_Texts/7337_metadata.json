The Treasury Department had said in January that as many as 6 million taxpayers would pay the fine.\n\nThe average penalty was $190, the Internal Revenue Service said Wednesday in a report. About 300,000 taxpayers overpaid the penalty by a total of $35 million. Most should have been exempt for their low income, according to the agency.\n\nThe average overpayment was a little more than $110. The IRS hasn\u2019t decided yet whether to issue a refund for the overpayments.\n\n\u201cSince the majority of taxpayers use paid tax-return preparers, most would probably spend more than the roughly $110 average overpayment amount in preparer fees if amended returns are required,\u201d the agency said.\n\nAbout 10.7 million taxpayers filed for an exemption from the penalty.\n\nFor those who did gain health-care coverage under new marketplaces created by Obamacare, 2.6 million filed for premium tax credits to help them afford insurance, adding up to $7.7 billion in subsidies. The average tax credit was $3,000, the IRS said.\n\nAbout 8 million people purchased health coverage through the government-run marketplaces in 2014.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "obamacare, fines, 6million, paid", "pubdate": "2015-07-15T12:45:40", "og": {"site_name": "Newsmax", "description": "About 6.6 million U.S. taxpayers paid a penalty imposed for the first time this year for not having health insurance, about 10 percent more than the Obama administration had estimated -- though a portion didn't need to.The penalty of as much as 1 percent of income was...", "title": "Obamacare Fines Paid by $6.6 Million Taxpayers", "url": "http://www.newsmax.com/Newsfront/obamacare-fines-6million-paid/2015/07/15/id/657230/", "type": "article", "image": "http://www.newsmax.com/CMSPages/GetFile.aspx?guid=c785849b-8d2d-4302-bb1d-a53a5f7c3ebf&SiteName=Newsmax", "page_id": 85452072376}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.newsmax.com/Newsfront/obamacare-fines-6million-paid/2015/07/15/id/657230/", "title": "Obamacare Fines Paid by $6.6 Million Taxpayers", "description": "About 6.6 million U.S. taxpayers paid a penalty imposed for the first time this year for not having health insurance, about 10 percent more than the Obama administration had estimated -- though a portion didn't need to.The penalty of as much as 1 percent of income was...", "site": "Newsmax"}, "fb": {"admins": 100002083767056, "app_id": 323020797885219}, "msvalidate.01": "FAF1322EC761685A5DD9344A1C19E82A", "epoch": 1436964340, "google-site-verification": "Jt2HUKgzJJw9VwIQJv31ETytuvNNm5ypTWN6j0nYvHM", "keywords": "obamacare, fines, 6million, paid", "article": {"section": "Newsfront", "published_time": "2015-07-15T12:45:40"}, "original-source": "http://www.newsmax.com/Newsfront/obamacare-fines-6million-paid/2015/07/15/id/657230/", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "description": "Obamacare Fines Paid by 6.6 Million Taxpayers, More Than Planned"}, "article_summary": "The Treasury Department had said in January that as many as 6 million taxpayers would pay the fine.\nAbout 6.6 million U.S. taxpayers paid a penalty imposed for the first time this year for not having health insurance, about 10 percent more than the Obama administration had estimated -- though a portion didn\u2019t need to.\nAbout 10.7 million taxpayers filed for an exemption from the penalty.\nThe average penalty was $190, the Internal Revenue Service said Wednesday in a report.\nThe average tax credit was $3,000, the IRS said."}
