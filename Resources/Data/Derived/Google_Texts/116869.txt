Marco Rubio’s hilariously repetitive performance at the GOP primary debate on Saturday even had his fellow candidates — Chris Christie most notable among them — mocking him, but those candidates would do better to look in the mirror, because as Paul Krugman argued in his column Monday, their entire party is engaged in the same tactic on a grander level.

For example, on Groundhog Day, House Republicans voted for the 63rd time to defund ObamaCare, a purely symbolic gesture which the GOP cannot, for obvious reasons, stop repeating. The reason? The oft-repeated myth that ObamaCare kills jobs — it doesn’t — which goes hand-in-hand without another Republican canard, the notion that taxing the wealthy has a deleterious effect on economic growth.
