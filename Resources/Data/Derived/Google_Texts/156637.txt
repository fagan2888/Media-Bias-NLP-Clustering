Geraldine Matthews, the wife of state Sen. John Matthews, passed away Christmas Day.

Senator John Matthews represents the 39th District of South Carolina, including the upper part of Dorchester County.

Geraldine was a prominent contributor to public education in South Carolina, having served as a school librarian.

She was a positive influence in the life of many of the students who knew her. In July, after being promoted to Commander of the state’s Army National Guard, Lt. Col. Renita L. Berry specifically thanked Geraldine for guiding her in her education, a key tool in Berry becoming the first African-American female to hold brigade command in SC Army National Guard.

Geraldine was also on the Board of Directors of the Orangeburg County School District 5 Education Foundation.

“Her loss affects us both individually and as a group – and not just politically or socially, but as human beings, too. Mrs. Matthews was a marvelous woman. A dedicated woman. A person who knew what was right – who stood up for what was right – who worked to make sure that right was achieved. And in those efforts, she helped many achieve impressive goals.” said Ethel D. Campbell, Chair of the Dorchester County Democratic Party.
