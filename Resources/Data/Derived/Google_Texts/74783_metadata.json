Thousands of public comments had been received and scores of newspaper stories had been written.\n\nYet, in boisterous meetings before the final decision, the consensus was the overall highway plan was developed in private without public input.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have a great explanation,\u201d said Will Toor, transportation director for the Southwest Energy Efficiency Project. \u201cI literally have been involved in the public process on this for 15 years.\u201d\n\nA few years ago, Denver Public Schools held regular meetings in the Montbello neighborhood about a plan to reconfigure the schools in the area. Robocalls notified people about the meetings, letters went home with students, and newspaper articles announced the details. The public meetings were catered. Each evening featured small-group discussions about what should be done. Yet, when the school board voted to approve the project, opponents argued that DPS failed to adequately engage the public.\n\nMore recently, Denver\u2019s Parks and Recreation Department began collecting ideas on replacing an aging playground in City Park. For 18 months, the city held meetings, took input and even had citizens vote on their favorite playground designs. A backlash over the design and a claim that the city failed to involve the community forced officials to pull back on the project.\n\nIt is true that despite the city\u2019s efforts to get people to the meetings about City Park, very few people attended. \u201cIt is clear that our outreach requires more work,\u201d the city now says on its website.\n\nWhat is going on here? If no one is paying attention until the very end, why have the meetings in the first place? If a meeting occurs and no one remembers, did it really happen?\n\nAmy Ford, spokeswoman for the Colorado Department of Transportation, said her team is trying to learn from the U.S. 36 experience. The state is facing major decisions about rebuilding Interstate 70 through Denver. Ford says her team is going door-to-door and having regular coffee meetings for neighbors with the project manager. \u201cInevitably,\u201d she said, \u201cyou will probably have people saying there wasn\u2019t enough public engagement.\u201d\n\nFord and Toor said they were surprised how quickly misinformation about the U.S. 36 project spread \u2014 from conspiracy theories about government corruption to allegations that the entire highway would be tolled.\n\nFord believes the anger surrounding U.S. 36 was more about the philosophical disagreement over the public-private partnership that will manage the toll roads, not about the lack of input or meetings. It is a new concept for state highway construction, allowing CDOT to build roads without raising taxes. And there is legitimacy to frustrations over the contract being developed in private.\n\n\u201cYou continue to do your best,\u201d Ford said, \u201creach out the best you can, recognize you won\u2019t be able to hit everyone and hope the tools are there to allow you to do better.\u201d\n\nE-mail Jeremy Meyer at jpmeyer@denverpost.com.
