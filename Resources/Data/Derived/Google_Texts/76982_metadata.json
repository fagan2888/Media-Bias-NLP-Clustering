In 2013, the company also received authorization from the U.S. Department of Labor to fund accidental death and dismemberment benefits for U.S. employees through the captive.\n\nThere are other advantages to captive benefits funding, Ms. Apter said. For example, funding benefit risks diversifies a captive's book of business while also ensuring greater predictability of costs compared with buying benefit coverages in the commercial market, where rates can fluctuate wildly from one year to the next.\n\n\u201cWe are not going to price coverages at a deficit to keep the business,\u201d Ms. Apter said.\n\nStill, there are challenges to funding benefit risks through captives, Ms. Apter said, noting that a \u201chands-on approach\u201d is required.\n\n\u201cIt is not an autopilot program,\u201d she said.\n\nIn addition, it took \u201clots of travel and meetings\u201d to get local Coca-Cola units abroad to participate, she said.\n\nAt the same time, \u201cYou have to explain to local managers how\u201d captive benefit funding works, said Pascal Prevost, an executive with Nestle S.A.'s group risk services in Vevey, Switzerland, who also spoke at the WCF session.\n\nWorldwide, roughly 70 to 80 employers use their captives to fund benefit risks, said Mark Cook, a principal with Towers Watson & Co. in London, another speaker at the session.\n\n\u201cThere is a lot of interest in this area,\u201d he said.\n\nIndeed, just last month, two U.S. big employers \u2014 Hormel Foods Corp. in Austin, Minnesota, and Sealed Air Corp. in Charlotte, North Carolina\u2014filed applications with the Labor Department seeking DOL approval through a rapid regulatory review procedure to fund certain benefit risks through their Vermont captives.\n\nThe department is expected to hand down its rulings sometime in March, which, if favorable, could spur additional employers to expand their captives to fund benefit risks, experts say.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Business Insurance", "description": "BOCA RATON, Fla. \u2014 For The Coca-Cola Co., the advantage of funding employee benefit risks through its South Carolina-based captive insurer is very straightforward.\u201cIt is a more efficient way of providing benefits,\u201d said Stacy Apter, Coca-Cola's director of global benefits...", "title": "Coca-Cola finds captive insurer most efficient way to fund benefits - Business Insurance", "url": "http://www.businessinsurance.com/article/20150204/NEWS03/150209935", "image": "http://www.businessinsurance.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/CB/20150204/NEWS03/150209935/AR/0/coca-cola-co.jpg", "type": "article"}, "image_src": "http://www.businessinsurance.com/assets/rwd/bi-logo-footer.png", "description": "BOCA RATON, Fla. \u2014 For The Coca-Cola Co., the advantage of funding employee benefit risks through its South Carolina-based captive insurer is very straightforward.\u201cIt is a more efficient way of providing benefits,\u201d said Stacy Apter, Coca-Cola's director of global benefits...", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no, minimal-ui", "title": "Coca-Cola finds captive insurer most efficient way to fund benefits - Business Insurance"}, "article_summary": "There are other advantages to captive benefits funding, Ms. Apter said.\nBOCA RATON, Fla. \u2014 For The Coca-Cola Co., the advantage of funding employee benefit risks through its South Carolina-based captive insurer is very straightforward.\nStill, there are challenges to funding benefit risks through captives, Ms. Apter said, noting that a \u201chands-on approach\u201d is required.\n\u201cIt is a more efficient way of providing benefits,\u201d said Stacy Apter, Coca-Cola's director of global benefits financing and asset management in Atlanta.\nAmong other things, Coca-Cola uses its captive, Red Re Inc., to fund international life, disability and medical insurance benefits."}
