(Kaiser Health News is not affiliated with Kaiser Permanente.)\n\n[Also: Kaiser mental health workers strike, claim hiring freeze]\n\nIn addition, the department, which regulates California\u2019s managed health care companies, found that Kaiser\u2019s informational materials \u2014 as well as some providers themselves \u2014 improperly indicated to customers that long-term individual therapy was not available to enrollees, even though coverage of treatment for severe mental illness is required under state and federal mental health parity laws.\n\nTuesday\u2019s report is a follow-up to an inspection released in March 2013, which identified four major deficiencies in the health plan\u2019s delivery of mental health services. Kaiser agreed to pay a $4 million fine \u2014 one of the largest ever by an insurer in the state. At the time, the managed health care department said it would follow up on the plan\u2019s progress a few months later. The results were not released until now.\n\nIn this follow-up report, the department found that Kaiser had solved two of the four problems by improving the way it collects and analyzes data about access to appropriate mental health care.\n\n\u201cKaiser has made progress in being able to identify when and where the problems around access are occurring, but they are still not able to address the problems when they arrive,\u201d said department director Shelley Rouillard. \u201cThey still have a lot of work to do.\u201d\n\nKaiser officials say they have made significant strides in bolstering their provider network, including increasing their therapist staff. In addition, Kaiser is working with a separate company called ValueOptions to provide additional mental health care when necessary.\n\n\u201cWe are proud of the progress we have made to improve access to mental health care,\u201d Kaiser Permanente officials said in a statement. \u201cWe are committed to continuing to improve. We acknowledge there are still some areas where we need to continue making progress and do better for our patients,\u201d including improving access to appointments at some locations.\n\nIn Kaiser\u2019s Northern Region, the managed health care department found 22 percent of patients did not have timely access to either an initial or follow-up appointment. In one case, a sexual assault victim diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder and major depression was prescribed an antidepressant in an initial visit, but no follow-up appointment was scheduled.\n\nThe patient tried to schedule both individual and group therapy visits, but her psychiatrist responded by \u201coffering psychotherapy in the community at the patient\u2019s expense and suggested that the patient investigate appropriate group therapy in the community because weekly individual therapy was not available in the Plan, and Plan group therapy did not address sexual assault,\u201d according to the report.\n\nThe patient was eventually able to schedule an appointment with a Kaiser therapist \u2014 five months after her initial visit, the report said.\n\nAccording to another case cited by the department, a psychiatrist wrote an email to a patient saying that, \u201cNo one ever sees a therapist once a week in the Kaiser Health Plan. Not a covered benefit for the past 20-something years and will not be a benefit in the future.\u201d\n\nFollow Healthcare Finance on Twitter and LinkedIn.\n\nBased on Tuesday\u2019s report, the managed health care department\u2019s Office of Enforcement will consider whether Kaiser Permanente should face further disciplinary action, which could include another fine.\n\nKaiser Permanente is one of the largest not-for-profit health plans in the country, with an operating revenue of $56.4 billion and almost 7.5 million members in California.\n\nThe company has been in a protracted labor dispute with the National Union of Healthcare Workers, which represents the plan\u2019s therapists. Union leaders have accused the health plan of a \u201cchronic failure to provide \u2026 quality mental health care.\u201d In its written statement, Kaiser blamed the union for continued problems in providing timely access to mental health care.\n\n\u201cWe need union leadership to work constructively together with us to remove obstacles and solve problems more quickly \u2026\u201d the statement said.\n\nKaiser Health News is a national health policy news service.
