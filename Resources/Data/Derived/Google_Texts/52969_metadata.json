Bush. The bill would have taken away power the federal government has over education. A different version pushed by Democrats in the Senate did not come to a floor vote. President Obama had threatened to veto the House measure, which would have not reauthorized funding for Race to the Top.\n\nRep. John Kline (R-Minn.), chairman of the House Education and Workforce Committee, slammed the administration's report as a \"PR stunt.\"\n\n\"The administration\u2019s latest PR stunt doesn\u2019t prove Race to the Top is working, it proves the administration is clumsily trying to take credit for the extraordinary education reform movement happening in our nation\u2019s schools,\" he said in a statement.\n\nKline suggested Obama should endorse the bill the House passed last year to amend \"No Child Left Behind,\" which would allow state and local governments to have greater control over their education systems.\n\n\"The House has approved legislation that will accomplish these goals, helping prepare more students for a successful future,\" he said. \"It\u2019s time for the president and his Senate colleagues to join our efforts.\"\n\n\u2014This report was updated at 3:14 p.m.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Education Secretary Arne Duncan said \"reforms are having an impact.\"", "description": "Education Secretary Arne Duncan said \"reforms are having an impact.\"", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "rdfs": {"label skos": {"prefLabel": "Blog Briefing Room"}}, "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "Education Secretary Arne Duncan said \"reforms are having an impact.\"", "title": "After 4 years, 'Race to the Top' a success?", "url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/201657-4-years-later-race-to-the-top-initiative-a-success", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/thehill_logo_200.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-02T12:18:14-05:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-02T12:18-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/201657-4-years-later-race-to-the-top-initiative-a-success", "dcterms.date": "2014-03-25T12:50-04:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Rebecca Shabad", "author": "Rebecca Shabad", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Education, Race to the Top, Arne Duncan, Barack Obama,Arne Duncan,Race to the Top", "article": {"published_time": "2014-03-25T12:50:18-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-02T12:18:14-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/201657-4-years-later-race-to-the-top-initiative-a-success", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "Education Secretary Arne Duncan said \"reforms are having an impact.\"", "card": "summary", "title": "After 4 years, 'Race to the Top' a success?"}, "dcterms.title": "After 4 years, 'Race to the Top' a success?"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc33f\"", "article_summary": "Twenty-two million students and 1.5 million teachers in 40,000 schools receive Race to the Top grants from the federal government, the report said.\nPresident Obama had threatened to veto the House measure, which would have not reauthorized funding for Race to the Top.\nNearly four years after the \"Race to the Top\" education initiative was introduced, an Obama administration report released Tuesday suggests the program has effectively spurred reform in states.\nRep.
