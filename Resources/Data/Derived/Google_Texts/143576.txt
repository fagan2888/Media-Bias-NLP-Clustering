"The task we are setting for ourselves is to have a budget deficit at 3 percent of GDP under (an oil price of) $40 (per barrel)," he told an economic conference. "If the oil price is as it's shaping up now - $32-33 - accordingly, it (budget deficit) will be up to 4 percent of GDP," Siluanov said.

He added that the finance ministry would have to increase its borrowing volumes in the nearest future.
