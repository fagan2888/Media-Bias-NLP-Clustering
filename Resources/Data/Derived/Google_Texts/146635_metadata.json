The 23-year-old took out her phone Tuesday night and tweeted, creating a now viral hashtag: #IStandWithAhmed.\n\n\u201cI felt like I needed to, I had to,\u201d Jafari said. \u201cIt\u2019s something that came out.\u201d\n\nIf his name was John he would be labeled as a genius. Since its Ahmed he\u2019s labeled as a \u201csuspect\u201d. #doublestandards #IStandWithAhmed \u2014 Amneh Jafari (@AmnehJafari) September 16, 2015\n\nBy Thursday night, it had been tweeted more than 1 million times. Since then, Ahmed\u2019s story has shot into another orbit. On Twitter, President Obama invited Ahmed to the White House. Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg invited him to headquarters. Even Twitter offered him an internship. It shows the power of social media to give a voice to the voiceless, Jafari said. \u201cTo see that there\u2019s so many good people in the world \u2013 sorry,\u201d she said, wiping tears from her eyes. \u201cIt means so much to see so many people stand for what\u2019s right.\u201d Ahmed Mohamed said the support from celebrities, politicians and ordinary citizens alike boosted his confidence. \u201cIt made me feel like I had the power to fight for others who couldn\u2019t fight back for themselves,\u201d Mohamed said.\n\nAhmed talking to and thanking @AmnehJafari who started hashtag #IStandWithAhmed pic.twitter.com/gQ58KGmFDE \u2014 Alia Salem (@aliarsalem) September 17, 2015\n\nThe hashtag isn\u2019t just about Ahmed, Jafari adds. And perhaps that\u2019s why it resonates with so many people.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about all the other kids that have been discriminated against in this country \u2013 no matter what religion, race,\u201d she said. \u201cI feel like it also represents them, as well.\u201d\n\nREAD: Obama: No religion responsible for terrorism\n\nJafari thinks Ahmed was the victim of Islamophobia, and she says she has been, too. But she believes a simple hashtag has become a huge milestone toward creating awareness.\n\nIrving Police Department and Irving Independent School District have said that Ahmed\u2019s name and religion had nothing to do with the way they handled this case.\n\nShe hasn\u2019t had the chance to meet the teen behind the hashtag yet, but Ahmed called her Wednesday. Jafari smiles just thinking about it.\n\n\u201cHe was thanking me for everything that has happened and everything that I have done for his cause,\u201d Jafari said. \u201cHe\u2019s an amazing kid, and I never would have thought we would have crossed paths this way.\u201d\n\n(Hernandez reports for WFAA-TV, Dallas-Fort Worth)\n\nLM END HERNANDEZ", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Beliefs, Culture, Ahmed Mohamed, islam, Islamic terrorism, Islamophobia, President Barack Obama, White House", "generator": "Easy Digital Downloads v2.5.16", "og": {"site_name": "Religion News Service", "description": "DALLAS -- The viral Twitter hashtag supporting the clock-making Texas teen arrested as a terror suspect was launched by a college student, Amneh Jafari.", "title": "The student behind viral #IStandWithAhmed: \u2018I had to\u2019", "url": "http://religionnews.com/2015/09/18/the-student-behind-viral-istandwithahmed-i-had-to/", "image": "http://religionnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Amneh-Jafari.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@RNS", "card": "summary"}, "syndication-source": "http://religionnews.com/2015/09/18/the-student-behind-viral-istandwithahmed-i-had-to/", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://religionnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-RNS_logo_RGB-336x336.gif", "original-source": "http://religionnews.com/2015/09/18/the-student-behind-viral-istandwithahmed-i-had-to/", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "description": "DALLAS -- The viral Twitter hashtag supporting the clock-making Texas teen arrested as a terror suspect was launched by a college student, Amneh Jafari."}, "article_summary": "The 23-year-old took out her phone Tuesday night and tweeted, creating a now viral hashtag: #IStandWithAhmed.\nAhmed talking to and thanking @AmnehJafari who started hashtag #IStandWithAhmed pic.twitter.com/gQ58KGmFDE \u2014 Alia Salem (@aliarsalem) September 17, 2015The hashtag isn\u2019t just about Ahmed, Jafari adds.\n#doublestandards #IStandWithAhmed \u2014 Amneh Jafari (@AmnehJafari) September 16, 2015By Thursday night, it had been tweeted more than 1 million times.\n\u201cIt means so much to see so many people stand for what\u2019s right.\u201d Ahmed Mohamed said the support from celebrities, politicians and ordinary citizens alike boosted his confidence.\n\u201cHe was thanking me for everything that has happened and everything that I have done for his cause,\u201d Jafari said."}
