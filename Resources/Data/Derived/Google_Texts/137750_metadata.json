She\u2019s never been given championship hardware at a professional tournament before.\n\nStephens earned a WTA title for the first time Sunday, overwhelming Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova of Russia 6-1, 6-2 in the final of the hard-court Citi Open.\n\n\u201cNothing was rushed. Nothing was given to me. I had to work for everything. It was just nice that all of the hard work and everything I\u2019ve put into it - now I can say that I have a tournament title,\u201d Stephens said. \u201cEverything happens when it\u2019s supposed to happen.\u201d\n\nIt was her first final as a pro.\n\nEntering this tuneup for the U.S. Open, she owned a .685 career winning percentage at Grand Slam tournaments, including getting to the second week in seven appearances, with a semifinal showing at the Australian Open and quarterfinal run at Wimbledon, both in 2013. But at lesser events, her winning percentage was only .524.\n\nAt Washington, for example, she was just 3-4 before this year, with three first-round exits. But Stephens did not lose a set during her four victories this week, highlighted by a semifinal win over 2011 U.S. Open champion Sam Stosur on Saturday.\n\nNeither of Sunday\u2019s finalists was seeded; Stephens is ranked 35th, and Pavlyuchenkova is 40th.\n\nStephens raced to a 3-0 lead within 10 minutes by taking 15 of the first 21 points and never looked back. She broke Pavlyuchenkova five times while saving 5 of 6 break points she faced and compiled an impressive ratio of 20 winners to nine unforced errors.\n\nAt her news conference, a reporter mentioned that Stephens has been considered the best women\u2019s tennis player without a title for quite some time.\n\n\u201cNow you\u2019ll have somebody else to talk about,\u201d Stephens replied. \u201cI\u2019m sure there\u2019s someone else, so I will pass that torch on to whoever\u2019s behind me.\u201d\n\n___\n\nFollow Howard Fendrich on Twitter at http://twitter.com/HowardFendrich", "article_metadata": {"description": "Sloane Stephens sat at a table for her postmatch news conference, eyed the big glass trophy sitting at arm's length, and asked, \"What happens to this?\"", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Sloane Stephens sat at a table for her postmatch news conference, eyed the big glass trophy sitting at arm\u2019s length, and asked, \u201cWhat happens to this?\u201d", "title": "Stephens tops Pavlyuchenkova at Citi Open for 1st WTA title", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/aug/9/stephens-tops-pavlyuchenkova-at-citi-open-for-1st-/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/08/09/b81c4807960ca7237e0f6a7067008a7b.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/08/09/b81c4807960ca7237e0f6a7067008a7b.jpg", "description": "Sloane Stephens sat at a table for her postmatch news conference, eyed the big glass trophy sitting at arm's length, and asked, \"What happens to this?\"", "card": "summary", "title": "Stephens tops Pavlyuchenkova at Citi Open for 1st WTA title"}, "Author": "HOWARD FENDRICH", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "article_summary": "Stephens earned a WTA title for the first time Sunday, overwhelming Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova of Russia 6-1, 6-2 in the final of the hard-court Citi Open.\nIt was just nice that all of the hard work and everything I\u2019ve put into it - now I can say that I have a tournament title,\u201d Stephens said.\nAt her news conference, a reporter mentioned that Stephens has been considered the best women\u2019s tennis player without a title for quite some time.\nNeither of Sunday\u2019s finalists was seeded; Stephens is ranked 35th, and Pavlyuchenkova is 40th.\nBut Stephens did not lose a set during her four victories this week, highlighted by a semifinal win over 2011 U.S. Open champion Sam Stosur on Saturday."}
