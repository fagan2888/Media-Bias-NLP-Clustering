Similarly, I am not writing this article in my capacities as a political columnist, graduate student or local Pennsylvania politician, but as a concerned citizen \u2014 not only of the United States, but of the world. Like President Obama, who made news this week by pointing out that the climate change crisis threatens every aspect of America\u2019s future, I want to make sure my children will grow up in a strong country, one that is safe and secure on a healthy planet. And America needs Al Gore to make a bid for the White House because of his unique credibility on anthropogenic global warming.\n\nAs the EPA explains on their website, a failure to reduce greenhouse gases in our atmosphere will have a devastating effect on \u201cour food supply, water resources, infrastructure, ecosystems, and even our own health.\u201d In addition, as former Navy Rear Admiral David Titley explained in a recent Op-Ed to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, the confluence of violently unpredictable changes in our weather patterns and drastic reduction in vital resources will destabilize the international political scene, as the countries that stand to gain or lose the most from climate change will be compelled to overhaul their economic and foreign policies accordingly. As Titley somberly put it, \u201cClimate change is an accelerating threat to national security.\u201d\n\nYet even though a recent survey of more than 12,000 peer-reviewed climate science papers found that 97 percent of climate scientists agree that global warming is man-made, a CBS News poll last May found that only 49 percent of Americans accept that climate change has been caused by human activity, with 33 percent attributing it mainly to natural patterns, 11 percent claiming it doesn\u2019t exist, and 6 percent either saying that they don\u2019t know or that it is caused by both. Moreover, climate change has long struggled to be taken seriously as a major national priority, a problem reinforced last month when a Bloomberg National Poll found only 5 percent of Americans ranked it as the most important issue facing the country today (placing it seventh).\n\nThe good news is that, as Berkeley psychology professor Michael Ranney demonstrated in a 2012 study, people can change their minds when the dynamics of climate change are broken down for them in a straightforward and easily digestible manner. To quote snippets of the 400-word explanation that Ranney found was most persuasive:\n\nSince the industrial age began around the year 1750, atmospheric carbon dioxide has increased by 40% and methane has increased by 150%. Such increases cause extra infrared light absorption, further heating Earth above its typical temperature range (even as energy from the sun stays basically the same). In other words, energy that gets to Earth has an even harder time leaving it, causing Earth\u2019s average temperature to increase \u2013 producing global climate change\u2026 (a) Earth absorbs most of the sunlight it receives; (b) Earth then emits the absorbed light\u2019s energy as infrared light; (c) greenhouse gases absorb a lot of the infrared light before it can leave our atmosphere; (d) being absorbed slows the rate at which energy escapes to space; and (e) the slower passage of energy heats up the atmosphere, water, and ground.\n\nUnfortunately, the simple science has been obscured in our political debate. While special interest groups can make some headway by lobbying, no weapon comes remotely close to the potency of a high-profile presidential campaign when it comes to mobilizing large sections of the population and transforming public opinion. Even an Academy Award-winning movie that became part of our pop culture zeitgeist \u2014 I\u2019m referring, of course, to Gore\u2019s iconic documentary \u201cAn Inconvenient Truth\u201d \u2014 had a limited effect because it was viewed as the pet project of a supporting character in the ongoing American story. For better or worse, we live in a society that is over-saturated with issues and advocates; as a result, anyone who is not an active main character on today\u2019s political stage quickly finds his or her cause lost in the noise or, at best, championed only by a static niche of activists and casual policy junkies. The people running for president, however \u2014 and in particular someone like Gore, who has the unique distinction of having won the popular vote in a general election, even if he lost the war \u2014 are never just supporting characters.\n\nThis brings me to the critical detail of a hypothetical Gore candidacy: It would have to be a single-issue campaign. In part this is a fail-safe measure; while a strong case can be made that Gore would make an excellent president (a premise with which a plurality of American voters agreed in 2000), the primary objective would not be to promote Gore the man, but to guarantee due attention is paid to the threat of climate change. While other campaigns on both sides would continue the practice of focusing on several issues in the name of advancing a name brand (i.e., the individual candidate), Gore would have the advantage of representing not his own cause, but the cause of creating an environmentally sustainable future. Indeed, he wouldn\u2019t have to actually win in the primaries to achieve his goal. As long as he consistently received a large enough percentage of the primary vote to be considered a \u201cmajor player,\u201d he would (a) keep climate change in the national headlines; and (b) force the other candidates to prioritize climate change in the hope of winning over his supporters.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Maybe he wouldn't win, but Al Gore could still make climate change one of the biggest stories of 2016", "author": "Matthew Rozsa", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Maybe he wouldn't win, but Al Gore could still make climate change one of the biggest stories of 2016", "title": "Al Gore is the single-issue candidate we need", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/07/19/al_gore_is_the_single_issue_candidate_we_need/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/07/al_gore.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Maybe he wouldn't win, but Al Gore could still make climate change one of the biggest stories of 2016", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/07/al_gore.jpg", "title": "Al Gore is the single-issue candidate we need", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Al Gore is the single-issue candidate we need", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, 2016, 2016 presidential election, Al Gore, Climate Change, Editor's Picks, Elections 2016, Global Warming", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477afa6914bd0286fe6111\"", "article_summary": "Topics: 2016, 2016 presidential election, Al Gore, Climate Change, Editor's Picks, Elections 2016, Global Warming, News, Politics NewsWith Republican pundits speculating on the possibility of a third Mitt Romney bid for the White House, I think it\u2019s appropriate to mention another two-time presidential candidate whose moment has come in 2016 \u2014 Al Gore.\nAnd America needs Al Gore to make a bid for the White House because of his unique credibility on anthropogenic global warming.\nThis brings me to the critical detail of a hypothetical Gore candidacy: It would have to be a single-issue campaign.\nI have never met Gore, nor am I connected with anyone who has a professional interest in seeing a renaissance for Gore\u2019s political career.\nThe good news is that, as Berkeley psychology professor Michael Ranney demonstrated in a 2012 study, people can change their minds when the dynamics of climate change are broken down for them in a straightforward and easily digestible manner."}
