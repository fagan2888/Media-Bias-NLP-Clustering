He says no patterns of fraud were uncovered.\n\nGov. Susana Martinez\u2019s administration froze payments to the providers after a 2013 audit alleged they mishandled $36 million in Medicaid funding.\n\nBalderas says separate investigations found there was about $1.16 million in overbilling but no evidence of fraud.\n\nHe says it\u2019s now up to the state Human Services Department to resolve what he called a regrettable situation and ensure that New Mexicans get the care they need.\n\n\u201cThere needs to be greater details, greater efficiency when referring these cases so that we do not put at risk any patient or vulnerable populations in New Mexico,\u201d Balderas said.\n\nThe Governor\u2019s Office released this statement:\n\nMedicaid funds should be used to provide basic health care for those in need, and I will never turn a blind-eye to wealthy CEOs who break the public\u2019s trust and do things like funnel public money to family members and squander tax dollars on private planes.\n\nThe Human Services Department also released this statement:\n\nMedicaid dollars should be used to help the people who need it most, and if the Attorney General wants to turn a blind-eye to wealthy CEOs who over-billed and squandered those funds on things like private planes and luxury travel, that\u2019s solely on him. His decision to allow these agencies to get away scot-free reeks of bad politics and shortchanges the people who rely on Medicaid the most.\n\nBalderas argued back that while spending money on private planes and luxury travel may be questionable spending practices, his office did not find it fraudulent.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The last two of 15 mental health nonprofit providers under investigation for possible Medicaid fraud have been cleared by New Mexico's top p\u2026", "generator": "WordPress.com", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.linmedia.newstouch.krqe", "og": {"site_name": "KRQE News 13", "description": "The last two of 15 mental health nonprofit providers under investigation for possible Medicaid fraud have been cleared by New Mexico\u2019s top prosecutor.", "title": "New Mexico AG clears last 2 mental health providers of fraud", "url": "http://krqe.com/2016/04/05/new-mexico-ag-clears-last-2-mental-health-providers-of-fraud/", "image": {"width": 512, "identifier": "https://lintvkrqe.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/21f21254cfae7e0e720f6a7067007d1e.jpg", "height": 371}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The last two of 15 mental health nonprofit providers under investigation for possible Medicaid fraud have been cleared by New Mexico\u2019s top prosecutor.", "title": "New Mexico AG clears last 2 mental health providers of fraud", "image": {"src": "https://lintvkrqe.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/21f21254cfae7e0e720f6a7067007d1e.jpg?w=640"}, "creator": "@krqe", "site": "krqe", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "keywords": "News App Alert Home, New Mexico, News", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-tooltip": "Albuquerque News and Weather, Santa Fe, Rio Rancho, New Mexico | krqe.com", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=488525050", "fb": {"pages": 98691658081}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://krqe.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/8ec5fa807657323809caf8c9db73e4ed?s=16", "application-name": "KRQE News 13", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/krqenews", "published_time": "2016-04-05T14:10:53+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-05T23:35:47+00:00"}, "msvalidate.01": "D680B65910F40B115B0DE7298B906E56", "google-site-verification": "DybmyJ3qnLleDwi_e3uE6Wh_x8CKcwUamZdUxoElU1M", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "(AP Photo/Susan Montoya Bryan)ALBUQUERQUE (AP/KRQE) \u2013 The last two of 15 mental health nonprofit providers under investigation for possible Medicaid fraud have been cleared by New Mexico\u2019s top prosecutor.\nSusana Martinez\u2019s administration froze payments to the providers after a 2013 audit alleged they mishandled $36 million in Medicaid funding.\nAttorney General Hector Balderas sent a letter to state lawmakers Tuesday, informing them of the outcome of his investigation.\nBalderas argued back that while spending money on private planes and luxury travel may be questionable spending practices, his office did not find it fraudulent.\nBalderas says separate investigations found there was about $1.16 million in overbilling but no evidence of fraud."}
