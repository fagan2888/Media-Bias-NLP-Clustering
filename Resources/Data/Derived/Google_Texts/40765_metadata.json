I need your help!\u201d shouted a young man standing behind the president at the event at a recreation center in San Francisco. \u201cYou have a power to stop deportation for all undocumented immigrants in this country.\u201d\n\n\u201cActually, I don't,\u201d Mr. Obama replied. \u201cAnd that's why we're here.\u201d\n\n\u201cStop deportations!\u201d the crowd chanted. \u201cYes we can! Stop deportations!\u201d\n\nThe outburst interrupted an otherwise routine presidential speech aimed at drawing attention to an issue Obama views as vital, and away from the daily drip-drip of criticism over the rough rollout of Obamacare.\n\nBut it also reignited a question that has long undergirded the immigration debate: Can the president, in fact, do more on his own to address the nation\u2019s broken immigration system, while the issue sits stuck in a highly polarized Congress?\n\nAdvocates of comprehensive immigration reform believe he can, especially in light of the June 2012 move by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to delay legal action against undocumented teens and young adults for two years and give them work permits \u2013 an action called Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA).\n\n\u201cI think he overstates the case that he doesn\u2019t have the authority,\u201d says Frank Sharry, founder of the group America\u2019s Voice. \u201cHe may not have authority to give people a path to citizenship. Of course he doesn\u2019t. But does he have the authority to have DHS implement his priorities and reflect his values? Yes, and that\u2019s not happening.\u201d\n\nObama could add new categories of undocumented immigrants for deferred action, such as the parents of citizens and victims of domestic violence.\n\nA former counsel at DHS agrees that there is more Obama can do to help low-priority illegal immigrants, but that he can\u2019t solve the problem of 11 million undocumented immigrants on his own.\n\n\"There's certainly room for adjustment, but not anything sweeping,\" David A. Martin, law professor at the University of Virginia and a former DHS counsel, tells The Washington Post. \"The justifications for DACA made clear that this is not a situation where the president can reduce overall enforcement of immigration laws. He can just redirect it in certain ways.\"\n\nObama has moved unilaterally in other areas, such as the Affordable Care Act, where he has tweaked aspects of the law and deferred deadlines without going through Congress. Critics say such moves represent an abuse of presidential power, but without a court ruling, it\u2019s a largely political critique.\n\nThe president has declined to take executive action in other areas where he is under pressure and where legislation is pending, such as on the issue of employment discrimination against gays and lesbians.\n\nBut there are few issues as intractable and complex as the nation\u2019s broken immigration system. In fact, even as Obama expresses sympathy for law-abiding undocumented people, his administration has deported 2 million immigrants \u2013 more than President George W. Bush did in eight years.\n\nIn September, Obama told Spanish-language TV Noticias Telemundo that if he were to go beyond DACA and add new categories of deferred deportations, he would be \u201cignoring the law in a way that I think would be very difficult to defend legally.\u201d\n\nSo for now, it appears that legislation is the only way to make major strides on immigration. And given the hyperpartisan atmosphere in Washington \u2013 exacerbated last week when Senate majority leader Harry Reid (D) of Nevada exercised the \u201cnuclear option\u201d to end filibusters on some presidential nominations \u2013 prospects for immigration reform seem even more remote.\n\nLast week, Obama made the concession that he would support piecemeal reform, the House\u2019s preferred approach, if that\u2019s what it took. But he demanded that all the elements be there, including a path to citizenship for the undocumented, not just the enforcement aspects that Republicans support most.\n\nBut the House, which is scheduled to be in session only eight days in December, doesn\u2019t appear set to take up any aspect of reform anytime soon. And it certainly doesn't look likely to deal with the comprehensive bill passed by the Senate in June, 68 to 32, including 14 Republicans.\n\nLast week, Republican House Speaker John Boehner told reporters that he has \"no intention\" of ever going to a conference committee to compromise on the Senate bill.\n\nCome January, the budget comes back to the fore, with government funding set to expire again on Jan. 15. And as long as the president is back on his heels over the Affordable Care Act, the Republicans are probably disinclined to give him anything that looks like a political victory. The countdown is on toward next November\u2019s midterm elections, in which the GOP hopes to retake control of the Senate.\n\nBut what about the Republicans\u2019 need to woo Latino voters, among whom they did so poorly last year? In March, the Republican National Committee\u2019s \u201cautopsy\u201d on the 2012 election called on Republicans to \u201cembrace and champion comprehensive immigration reform.\u201d\n\nThe imperative appears weak for the 2014 midterms. The GOP already controls the House, and there are only a handful of Republican-held House districts with significant Latino populations \u2013 certainly not enough to fuel a Democratic takeover of the House.\n\nThe real challenge with the Latino vote comes in the presidential election of 2016. It could be hard for a Republican to win battleground states like Florida, Nevada, and Colorado without doing a lot better than Mitt Romney did among Latinos. But for now, Republicans are more focused on 2014.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.content.id": "47784d5c166687865bbff95b8d67863f", "sailthru.author": "Linda Feldmann", "description": "During a speech on immigration reform Monday, President Obama was interrupted by a heckler telling him to stop deportations by executive action.", "sailthru.image.std": "http://images.csmonitor.com/csm/2013/11/1125-Obama-heckler-immigration.jpg?alias=standard_380x253", "author": "The Christian Science Monitor", "og": {"site_name": "The Christian Science Monitor", "description": "During a speech on immigration reform Monday, President Obama was interrupted by a heckler telling him to stop deportations by executive action.", "title": "Obama tells heckler he can't halt deportations unilaterally.
