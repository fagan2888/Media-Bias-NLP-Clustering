Republican Gov. Robert Bentley is running for re-election. Bentley has one announced opponent on the GOP side, Stacy Lee George of Morgan County. The primaries are June 3.\n\nBass and his wife, Leah Newton Bass, own two companies that sell baseball gloves and bats over the Internet. Bass said he designs bats, most of which are manufactured overseas.\n\nBass will be making his second run for public office. He ran unsuccessfully for mayor of Fayette last year.\n\nThe Chicago Cubs drafted Bass out of Fayette High School in the third round of the 1998 draft. Bass, a third baseman and outfielder, played about five and a half years in the Cubs organization, all in the minor leagues.\n\nBass said the experience taught him valuable lessons and was humbling for a player who had been a high draft pick.\n\n\u201cWhat I sort of learned is that how hard you worked to get there, you\u2019ve got to work 10 times as hard once you\u2019re there,\u201d Bass said. \u201cGetting there is the easy part. Staying there is the hard part.\u201d\n\nBass attended college for a few years after his career with the Cubs ended in 2002, then got back into professional ball and spent a short time in the Chicago White Sox organization. His career ended in 2007 after an injury.\n\n\n\nBass started his business, Bass Gloves, that same year, initially selling batting and fielding gloves and expanding into other equipment. He later started a second company, Bass Bats.\n\n\n\nAs for politics, Bass said he was still learning about some of the issues he expects to be asked about on the campaign trail. For example, he\u2019s not sure whether he supports expansion of Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, something many of his fellow Democrats support. Bentley opposes expanding Medicaid.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of unforeseen questions that I\u2019ll be asked that, I\u2019ll just shoot you straight, I\u2019m probably not going to have a knowledgeable answer to tell you right at the time,\u201d Bass said. \u201cBut let me go back and talk and speak with some people that are very knowledgeable on the situation, and I can give you a pretty straightforward answer. It\u2019s like sports to me. Your state government is only as good as the team you surround yourself with.\u201d\n\nBass said he thought his business experience would give him some knowledge not shared by what he called career politicians.\n\n\u201cNone of them have ever had to make a dollar, turn it into two, turn two into a thousand,\u201d Bass said. \u2026 \u201cSo they don\u2019t know the value of a dollar.\u201d\n\nAsked why he was running as a Democrat, Bass said his family has always leaned to that party. He said his goal was to try to show leadership and give people hope.\n\n\u201cPeople have lost hope,\u201d Bass said. \u201cIt\u2019s like they\u2019ve just been beat down. The opportunity is not there anymore. That\u2019s my main reason for running, is to be the one to lead, show people, 'You know what, if you grew up in the housing authority, you can get out. You\u2019ve got to set yourself and make a goal. And you\u2019re going to do whatever you have to do to get that goal.' \u201d\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "news", "title": "Business owner, former pro baseball player Kevin Bass running for governor as a Democrat", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Business owner, former pro baseball player Kevin Bass running for governor as a Democrat\", \"link\": \"http://blog.al.com/wire/2013/12/business_owner_former_pro_base.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://image.al.com/home/bama-media/width620/img/wire/photo/13995407-standard.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"11886847\", \"pub_date\": \"2013-12-26T21:43:48Z\", \"author\": \"Mike Cason | mcason@al.com\", \"tags\": [\"@river-all\"] }", "twitter": {"image": "http://image.al.com/home/bama-media/width620/img/wire/photo/13995407-standard.jpg", "creator": "@MikeCasonAL", "site": "@aldotcom", "card": "summary", "description": "Bass is the first Democrat to announce his candidacy for governor next year."}, "article_date_updated": "Thursday, December 26, 2013,  3:43 PM", "parsely-metadata": "{\"short_title\": \"\", \"image_url\": \"http://media.al.com/wire/photo/kevin-bass-photojpg-22ee54e783b81abb.jpg\", \"author_name\": \"mikecason\", \"author_nickname\": \"Mike Cason | mcason@al.com\", \"author_id\": \"8026786\", \"source_blog_name\": \"Retired: Real-Time News from AL.com\", \"source_blog_url\": \"http://blog.al.com/wire/\", \"sponsored_content\": \"0\" }", "og": {"site_name": "AL.com", "description": "Bass is the first Democrat to announce his candidacy for governor next year.", "title": "Business owner, former pro baseball player Kevin Bass running for governor as a Democrat", "url": "http://blog.al.com/wire/2013/12/business_owner_former_pro_base.html", "image": "http://image.al.com/home/bama-media/width620/img/wire/photo/13995407-standard.jpg", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "AL.com", "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Thursday, December 26, 2013,  3:43 PM", "article_author": "Mike Cason | mcason@al.com", "Description": "Bass is the first Democrat to announce his candidacy for governor next year."}, "article_summary": "Bass started his business, Bass Gloves, that same year, initially selling batting and fielding gloves and expanding into other equipment.\nMONTGOMERY, Alabama --- Kevin Bass of Fayette, a business owner and former professional baseball player, has announced he will run for governor as a Democrat.\nBass and his wife, Leah Newton Bass, own two companies that sell baseball gloves and bats over the Internet.\nThe Chicago Cubs drafted Bass out of Fayette High School in the third round of the 1998 draft.\nBass said the experience taught him valuable lessons and was humbling for a player who had been a high draft pick."}
