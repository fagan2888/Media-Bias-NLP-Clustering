You make a timely film about an international sporting event \u2014 the Cricket World Cup. It\u2019s downright inspirational. That is, until your team gets knocked out of the tournament, and suddenly no one wants to see it anymore.\n\nThat\u2019s what happened to one of India\u2019s most important \u2014 and otherwise successful \u2014 indie film producers, Guneet Monga. Her response? Unwilling to let her investor lose all his money, she hustled to take the movie to smaller Indian cities, markets often ignored in favor of bustling Mumbai. In her hands and with her hustle, the would-be disaster turned a profit.\n\nAt 31, Monga is a bit of a maverick in Mumbai\u2019s cinema world. And not just because she goes to every possible length to revive even a dead-in-the-water movie. She\u2019s also been a risk taker in a country where your average movie follows a song-and-dance + melodrama + slapdash comedy equation. Her film company, Sikhya Entertainment, goes for the film festival crowd, often at the expense of movie theater success. Her 2013 film The Lunchbox, shot on a budget of approximately $1.5 million for Anurag Kashyap films, won accolades at Cannes, and got co-produced by studios in the United States, France and Germany. It became the highest-grossing foreign film in the U.S. in 2014, earning $4.2 million.\n\nThe film followed a lonely accountant and an unhappy wife in Mumbai, who fall in love thanks to a rare mix-up of lunchbox meals delivered by the city\u2019s famous dabbawalas \u2014 men who ride bikes through the city, dropping off over 200,000 meals a day. The story is \u201cso Indian indie,\u201d says film critic Raja Sen \u2014 but Monga\u2019s ability to hawk it abroad is a \u201ctestament\u201d to her skills.\n\nBut Monga\u2019s day-to-day work is also a testament to just how much crap film producers deal with, especially ambitious ones trying to break viewer stereotypes. Take That Girl in Yellow Boots, about a British woman who comes to Mumbai in search of her father, which premiered at the Venice Film Festival. While cast and crew alike were celebrating, Monga was \u201choled in her room \u2026 sending 20,000 emails and making phone calls nonstop to buyers, sales agents, distributors,\u201d remembers Vasan Bala, a colleague at Anurag Kashyap Films.\n\n\u201cI was just a business-minded person who loved taking up a project, owning it, seeing the end of it and seeing where it goes,\u201d she says. This jives with what others say: \u201cThat\u2019s the Guneet Monga Show: She goes out, does her talk and walk,\u201d says Bala.\n\nSuch a walk-and-talk is crucial, since Monga\u2019s task of ensuring that her films get commercially released is positively Sisyphean. \u201cOnly a fraction\u201d of Bollywood movies even make it to movie theaters, says Rudrarup Datta, vice president of marketing at Viacom18, a movie production studio. There are limited weekends, and fans know what they want. So when a movie theater owner has to decide between a populist, Shah Rukh Khan-starring song-and-dance extravaganza versus a Monga film, the choice is obvious.\n\nMonga\u2019s tolerance for nitty-gritty work began in her teens, when she got a job assisting her best friend\u2019s mother at her film production company in her native New Delhi. Her job involved photocopying papers, making Excel spreadsheets, entering phone numbers from diaries into a computer and generally being the extra hand whenever needed. But to Monga, that scene was free-spirited, liberating, nothing like a regular office job \u2014 just by virtue of the creativity in the atmosphere. \u201cI just knew that I wanted to be around these people and learn from them,\u201d she recalls.\n\nDon\u2019t think she\u2019s a number-punching drone, though. She\u2019s been a DJ, an insurance agent, an event planner, a rally car driver and a property saleswoman for her late father. In person, Monga is warm, chatty, forthcoming and funky. Dressed today in a black top and blue jeans, with henna-dyed hands and a mop of purple-colored hair, she\u2019s lived in Mumbai since graduating from college with a degree in mass communications. Throughout college, she kept working with that family friend, preparing call sheets, filing daily production reports and handling finances.\n\nHer big break came when she met Kashyap, the poster boy of Indian indie cinema, who was once her mentor and partner at Sikhya Entertainment. (She was formerly CEO of his film production company.) She began as a line producer on That Girl in Yellow Boots, his directorial project; from that she landed a full-time gig.\n\nOf course, none of her get-shit-done mentality can parallel her power of wacky thinking. Like this one time when Monga had her team of 27 paste posters of That Girl in Yellow Boots on their backs and walk around the Venice Film Festival. Or posting the script of one film on Facebook as a stunt to raise money. Or selling off the house she bought for her late parents \u2014 a lifelong dream \u2014 to be able to fund Monsoon Shoutout, a noir thriller whose financing fell apart due to the economic recession.\n\n\u201cI was like, \u2018What\u2019s the point of all these things?\u2019\u201d Well, at least compared to success.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Could there finally be a producer with a creative side and a get-shit-done side, who understands India?", "author": "Aayush Soni", "og": {"site_name": "OZY", "description": "Could there finally be a producer with a creative side and a get-shit-done side, who understands India?", "title": "Guneet Monga, Mumbai's Cinema Maverick", "url": "http://www.ozy.com/rising-stars/guneet-monga-mumbais-cinema-maverick/39790", "image": "http://pictures.ozy.com/pictures/1500xany/7/3/1/74731_Still-2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://pictures.ozy.com/pictures/1120xany/7/3/1/74731_Still-2.jpg"}, "description": "Could there finally be a producer with a creative side and a get-shit-done side, who understands India?", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Guneet Monga, Mumbai's Cinema Maverick"}, "fb": {"app_id": 155498561323567}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Ozy", "section": "Rising Stars"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "At 31, Monga is a bit of a maverick in Mumbai\u2019s cinema world.\nThat\u2019s what happened to one of India\u2019s most important \u2014 and otherwise successful \u2014 indie film producers, Guneet Monga.\nThis jives with what others say: \u201cThat\u2019s the Guneet Monga Show: She goes out, does her talk and walk,\u201d says Bala.\n\u201cOnly a fraction\u201d of Bollywood movies even make it to movie theaters, says Rudrarup Datta, vice president of marketing at Viacom18, a movie production studio.\nSo when a movie theater owner has to decide between a populist, Shah Rukh Khan-starring song-and-dance extravaganza versus a Monga film, the choice is obvious."}
