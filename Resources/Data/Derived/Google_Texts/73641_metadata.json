Santa Fe New Mexican Investigates LANL Radiation Leak\n\nJust over a year ago, a container of nuclear waste ruptured while in storage at the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) in New Mexico. It had been packed at the Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL). Radiation leaked out, exposing 21 workers to low levels. They were evacuated, and the facility closed. As the only underground nuclear-waste storage facility in the U.S., it has held up disposal efforts nationwide.\n\nThe barrel contained nitrate salt residues, organic cat litter and a neutralizing agent that created a \u201cpotentially reactive chemical mixture of fuels and oxidizers,\u201d the AP said.\n\n\u201cA series of ever-increasing heat releasing reactions occurred, which led to the creation of gases within the drum,\u201d the 277-page report stated, according to AP. \u201cThe resulting buildup of gases within the drum displaced the drum lid, venting radioactive material and hot matter that further reacted with the air or other materials outside the drum.\u201d\n\nThe WIPP remains closed indefinitely and will cost more than $500 million to clean up. The kitty-litter error\u2014it should have been inorganic rather than organic\u2014was just one of several safety violations and attempts to hide them that emerged over the course of last year\u2019s investigation. In December the New Mexico Environment Department fined the LANL and WIPP a total of $54 million for the breaches, the largest civil penalty ever levied by state authorities against the federal government. Both facilities are administered by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE).\n\nRELATED: Cold War Waste Disposal Stalled Around U.S. as WIPP Reopening Delayed by Months", "article_metadata": {"description": "A team of experts investigating the radiation leak at the Waste Isolation Pilot Project (WIPP) fingered organic kitty litter as part of the cause.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2015/03/28/wipp-nuclear-leak-definitely-caused-wrong-kind-kitty-litter-experts-159793", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "image": "http://d1jrw5jterzxwu.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/article_media/wipp_drums_doe.jpg.jpeg", "type": "article", "title": "WIPP Nuclear Leak Definitely Caused by Wrong Kind of Kitty Litter: Experts"}, "abstract": "A team of experts investigating the radiation leak at the Waste Isolation Pilot Project (WIPP) fingered organic kitty litter as part of the cause.", "dc": {"title": "WIPP Nuclear Leak Definitely Caused by Wrong Kind of Kitty Litter: Experts"}, "robots": "follow, index", "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2015/03/28/wipp-nuclear-leak-definitely-caused-wrong-kind-kitty-litter-experts-159793", "dcterms.creator": "theresa", "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Associated Press, WIPP, Waste Isolation Pilot Project, Los Alamos National Laboratory, LANL, Nuclear Waste, Nuclear Radiation, U.S. Department of Energy,", "validation_code": "d9d37d7b776cc351c4025ded3df21cad", "sioc": {"num_replies": 0}, "dcterms.date": "2015-03-28T10:30-04:00", "dcterms.title": "WIPP Nuclear Leak Definitely Caused by Wrong Kind of Kitty Litter: Experts"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf403\"", "article_summary": "As the only underground nuclear-waste storage facility in the U.S., it has held up disposal efforts nationwide.\nRELATED: Cold War Waste Disposal Stalled Around U.S. as WIPP Reopening Delayed by Months\nSanta Fe New Mexican Investigates LANL Radiation LeakJust over a year ago, a container of nuclear waste ruptured while in storage at the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) in New Mexico.\nRELATED: First Kitty Litter, Now a Typo?\n\u201cA series of ever-increasing heat releasing reactions occurred, which led to the creation of gases within the drum,\u201d the 277-page report stated, according to AP."}
