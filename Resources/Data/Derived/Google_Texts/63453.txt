Based on the surprising discovery of one Border Patrol officer, it’s safe to say human smugglers are getting more cunning by the day.

Breitbart Texas reports that Agent Hector Garza, president of the National Border Patrol Council, Local 2455, became suspicious of a Chevy Tahoe that was traveling north of Laredo, Texas—roughly 70 miles into the Lone Star State. The vehicle was painted to look like a Border Patrol SUV. After pulling the car over, the driver was arrested and the agent discovered 12 illegal aliens in the back.

Garza said the 12 illegal aliens stuffed in a Tahoe shows the total disregard for human life these smugglers show towards the people they haul. “If this vehicle had become involved in a high-speed chase, it could have been catastrophic.” The vehicle was painted to look like a Tahoe regularly used by the U.S. Border Patrol. It did not have any overhead lights normally found on the vehicles. It did; however, have a light bar mounted on the dashboard and the rear view mirror had been removed. It appears the rear seats may have been removed in order to stuff more people into the vehicle.

“This shows the level of deviousness and desperation these smugglers will stoop to in order to deliver their cargo,” Garza told Breitbart Texas. “They will not stop. Whether they are smuggling drug, humans or terrorists, to them it is just about the money.”
