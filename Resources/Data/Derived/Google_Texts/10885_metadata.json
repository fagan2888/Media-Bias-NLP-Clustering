Schellnhuber said reports that he said the Earth has a \u201ccarrying capacity of less than 1 billion\u201d are a \u201ccomplete lie.\u201d\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nLast week Breitbart News reported on Schellnhuber\u2019s participation in the Vatican rollout of the Pope\u2019s encyclical on the environment, in whi h Pope Francis endorsed the controversial theory of man-made global warming.\n\nBreitbart linked to a report in the New York Times on a 2009 speech Schellnhuber gave at the Copenhagen Climate Conference in which he talked about what would happen if the Earth\u2019s temperature spiked several degrees.\n\n\u201cIn a very cynical way, it\u2019s a triumph for science because at last we have stabilized something \u2013- namely the estimates for the carrying capacity of the planet, namely below 1 billion people,\u201d said Dr. Schellnhuber, who has advised German Chancellor Angela Merkel on climate policy and is a visiting professor at Oxford.\n\nInstead of suggesting that he was misquoted or that his critics misunderstood what he said at Copenhagen, Schellnhuber called reporters liars; \u201c\u2026it\u2019s a complete lie. You can go back to the original lecture. I gave it in Copenhagen. I know there are some vicious people who try to discredit you. I have never spoken in favor of population control measures. What I said in Copenhagen in 2009 was about the carrying capacity of the earth. There have been estimates since the 1700s on how many people in the earth can you carry, so to speak. This number goes up and down, and some say 10 billion, others 100 billion, some just 100 million.\u201d\n\nBut, at the Copenhagen speech, as reported in the New York Times, Schellnhuber did not elaborate so extravagantly as he did with Pentin. He did not say estimates of Earth\u2019s carrying capacity could be 10 billion or 100 billion. He said the carrying capacity of Earth is estimated \u201cat less than 1 billion,\u201d which is what Breitbart News and other outlets reported. It should be noted that radical environmentalists have long proposed what Schellnhuber proposed at Copenhagen, that the carrying capacity of the Earth is 1 billion or less, leaving open the question of what to do with the dangerous excess of six billion.\n\nIn the Pentin interview, however, Schellnhuber denied he is a population control advocate, though he used the phrase \u201cpopulation problem,\u201d which is a phrase population control advocates tend to use.\n\nHe went on to lay out his plan for population reduction: \u201cIf you want to reduce human population, there are wonderful means (italics added): Improve the education of girls and young women. Then the demographic transition will be a little bit faster and, as Cardinal Turkson said, you will enhance human capital and have emancipation of many people on earth. So I subscribe to a good education, and that\u2019s the only way of population strategy I would support.\u201d\n\nAn interview with Schellnhuber (in German on YouTube) has come to light in which he doubles down on his belief in overpopulation. In the interview he posits that when the Earth reaches nine billion people, which is projected to be very soon, \u201cThe Earth will explode\u201d due to resource depletion, which is similar to the now debunked argument first advanced by Paul Erlich in the 1960s that got the modern population control movement humming in the first place.\n\nDemographers, however, are coming to understand the problem is not the total number of people on Earth but rather population aging due to rapidly declining fertility rates coupled with increased life expectancy due to better diet and advances in medicine and science. What once were considered \u201cpopulation problems\u201d now go by other names \u2014 migration and urbanization, that is, the tendency of human populations to concentrate in increasingly massive urban areas such as Sao Paulo and Mexico City while leaving the countryside increasingly empty.\n\nIn the Pentin interview, Schellnhuber went on to mock any critics of global warming, \u201cAre the [critics] maybe chemists? I\u2019m a physicist by training and I\u2019ve worked on fundamental physics for a long time. I\u2019m also a mathematician.\u201d\n\nHe said critics were nothing more than believers in a flat-earth. Among climate skeptics, one likely cannot find a single flat-earther but rather many chemists, physicists and mathematicians.\n\nFollow Austin Ruse on Twitter @austinruse", "article_metadata": {"description": "The scientist recently appointed to a Vatican post has called his critics, including Breitbart News, \u201cvicious liars\u201d.", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "The scientist recently appointed to a Vatican post has called his critics, including Breitbart News, \u201cvicious liars\u201d.", "title": "Vatican's Newest Global Warming Extremist Calls Critics 'Vicious Liars' - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/06/Earth-NASA.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/06/20/vaticans-newest-global-warming-extremist-calls-critics-vicious-liars/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The scientist recently appointed to a Vatican post has called his critics, including Breitbart News, \u201cvicious liars\u201d.", "title": "Vatican's Newest Global Warming Extremist Calls Critics 'Vicious Liars' - Breitbart", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/06/Earth-NASA.jpg", "creator": "@austinruse", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true", "app_id": 1243316582352556}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": ",Big Government, Environment, Science,global warming", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Big Government", "published_time": "2015-06-20T12:21:57-07:00", "categories": "Big Government,Environment,Science"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "In the Pentin interview, Schellnhuber went on to mock any critics of global warming, \u201cAre the [critics] maybe chemists?\nInstead of suggesting that he was misquoted or that his critics misunderstood what he said at Copenhagen, Schellnhuber called reporters liars; \u201c\u2026it\u2019s a complete lie.\nHe did not say estimates of Earth\u2019s carrying capacity could be 10 billion or 100 billion.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERThe scientist recently appointed to a Vatican post has called his critics, including Breitbart News, \u201cvicious liars\u201d.\nHe said the carrying capacity of Earth is estimated \u201cat less than 1 billion,\u201d which is what Breitbart News and other outlets reported."}
