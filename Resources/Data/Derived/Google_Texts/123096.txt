Rapides Parish Fire District No. 2 has been authorized to purchase nearly 3 acres of land at the intersection of McKeithen Drive and Twin Bridges Road for a new fire station to serve that area.

The purchase of a 2.961-acre tract from G & G Farms of Cenla LLC has been approved by the Police Jury.

Police Jury President Richard Billings said, "We're trying to give the people out there more protection, plus they will have a better insurance rate" with a new fire station.

Juror Richard Vanderlick said the new fire tation will eventually be used as a training facility in addition to providing fire protection in the area.

Some residents in that general area have a fire insurance rating of Class 10, the worst, because they live too far from a fire station, Vanderlick said.

Once the new station is built, their fire insurance rating could improve to a Class 4 or 5, significantly cutting their fire insurance premiums.
