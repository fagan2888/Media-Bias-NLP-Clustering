What came first brought positive news to many that had little to no health coverage or needed financial support to get it. It also extended family member coverage to age 26, expanded preventive care, and erased obstacles to coverage like pre-existing conditions while eliminating lifetime maximums. There was much rejoicing in the land, and wringing of hands!\n\nOf course, nothing comes without a price, and the ACA has a mechanism to pay. Buried in the 974 pages of the ACA lies the excise tax. Basically, the excise tax states that if your total cost of coverage for an employee (or family) exceeds a certain benchmark price by 2020, then the employer loses the tax deductibility of the cost of insurance above this benchmark amount. After initial passage of the ACA, the excise tax was set to being in 2018. However, the tax was delayed until 2020 as part of a congressional FY2016 spending bill. You may have heard the tax being referred to as the \u201cCadillac tax\u201d, one which only the rich and privileged would face. Not true. Unfortunately this is not a Cadillac you can park out back and party in, because this piece of landmark legislation could not be less appropriately named. In fact, in client meetings, I avoid calling the excise tax the \u201cCadillac tax\u201d other than to clarify what I mean. The name is wildly inappropriate, and inaccurate. The \u201cHonda Tax\u201d (apology to the Honda Motor Company!) is a more appropriate name, and here\u2019s why:", "article_metadata": {"displaytag": "Cadillac tax", "sailthru.author": "Davin Millholland", "description": "Despite being delayed until 2020, the Affordable Care Act\u2019s so-called Cadillac tax on high-cost plans is still on the horizon and employers need to prepare for it.", "sailthru.expire_date": "2016-03-24T13:18:43.743-04:00", "og": {"site_name": "Employee Benefit News", "description": "Despite being delayed until 2020, the Affordable Care Act\u2019s so-called Cadillac tax on high-cost plans is still on the horizon and employers need to prepare for it.", "title": "ACA\u2019s excise tax not a Cadillac tax", "url": "http://www.benefitnews.com/opinion/acas-excise-tax-not-a-cadillac-tax", "image": "https://assets.sourcemedia.com/2e/45/868a08474649aceb34f236728769/ebn-cadillactax-2-24-16.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@EBNmagazine", "image": "https://assets.sourcemedia.com/2e/45/868a08474649aceb34f236728769/ebn-cadillactax-2-24-16.png", "description": "Despite being delayed until 2020, the Affordable Care Act\u2019s so-called Cadillac tax on high-cost plans is still on the horizon and employers need to prepare for it.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "ACA\u2019s excise tax not a Cadillac tax"}, "sailthru.date": "2016-02-24T13:18:43.743-05:00", "featured": 0, "sailthru.title": "ACA\u2019s excise tax not a Cadillac tax", "sailthru.tags": "Law and regulation, Healthcare-related legislation, ACA, Cadillac tax, Employee benefits, Healthcare plans, Health and wellness, Healthcare issues, Healthcare costs, Compliance", "fb": {"app_id": 1538398496471831}, "sponsored": 0, "contentprefix": "Views", "gptAdUnitPath": "/16059533/EBNBenefitNews/Opinion", "storyId": "00000153-1477-d36e-abfb-55ffdc470000", "keywords": "Cadillac tax, Healthcare plans, Healthcare costs, ACA, Compliance", "sailthru.description": "Despite being delayed until 2020, the Affordable Care Act\u2019s so-called Cadillac tax on high-cost plans is still on the horizon and employers need to prepare for it.", "sailthru.image.full": "https://assets.sourcemedia.com/2e/45/868a08474649aceb34f236728769/ebn-cadillactax-2-24-16.png", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Cadillac tax, Healthcare plans, Healthcare costs, ACA, Compliance"}, "article_summary": "In fact, in client meetings, I avoid calling the excise tax the \u201cCadillac tax\u201d other than to clarify what I mean.\nYou may have heard the tax being referred to as the \u201cCadillac tax\u201d, one which only the rich and privileged would face.\nAfter initial passage of the ACA, the excise tax was set to being in 2018.\nThe \u201cHonda Tax\u201d (apology to the Honda Motor Company!)\nBuried in the 974 pages of the ACA lies the excise tax."}
