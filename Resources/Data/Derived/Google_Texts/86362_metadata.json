Schneiderman called for his state to go even farther, proposing legislation that would force insurance companies to pay for men\u2019s sterilization procedures.\n\nAt the federal level, the Health and Human Services Department said it was trying to clear things up after women and members of Congress complained that some insurers were refusing to cover the specific contraceptives women\u2019s doctors were recommending.\n\nInsurers can in some cases still impose costs to prod women to use generics rather than brand-name drugs under the new guidance \u2014 but if a doctor or hospital recommends a particular drug or contraceptive device out of medical necessity, the plans must cover them without additional cost.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s announcement is an important step toward making it clear that all insurance companies should follow the rules and provide women with the health care they are entitled to,\u201d said Sen. Patty Murray, Washington Democrat, who led dozens of party colleagues this month in urging HHS to ensure compliance.\n\nInsurers too had sought more specifics about what was required under the Affordable Care Act and its contraceptive coverage provisions, which have been among the most controversial parts of the law.\n\nThey were supposed to give women free access to birth control, but some insurers were refusing to fully cover all types of contraceptives, meaning women who wanted a particular form of birth control had to pay some or all of the costs, the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation and other groups said in recent studies.\n\nThose groups said the new rules were a victory.\n\n\u201cInsurance companies have been breaking the law and, today, the Obama administration underscored that it will not tolerate these violations,\u201d the National Women\u2019s Law Center said. \u201cIt is now absolutely clear that all means all \u2014 all unique birth control methods for women must be covered.\u201d\n\nPro-choice groups and others had said insurers were using so-called \u201cmedical management\u201d to either skirt the rules or plead ignorance.\n\nFor example, an inquiry by the New York attorney general found one plan told a patient she couldn\u2019t get the NuvaRing \u2014 for which there is no generic on the market \u2014 without cost-sharing because she could use birth control pills with the same chemical formulation.\n\nHolly Lynch, a bioethics experts at Harvard Law School who closely tracks Obamacare\u2019s contraception rules, said that was exactly the type of problem that HHS wanted to erase.\n\n\u201cJust because a pill would be available for free doesn\u2019t mean that an insurer could refuse to make the ring available for free,\u201d she said.\n\nThe contraceptive mandate has been controversial from the start, though most of the attention has gone to the marathon court battle between the administration and employers who have religious objections to contraceptives, and who say forcing them to pay for employees\u2019 coverage violates their own rights.\n\nThe Supreme Court last year ruled closely held corporations do not have to insure types of birth control that violate their moral beliefs, and the Obama administration is expected to update its rules soon.\n\nReligious nonprofits, meanwhile, are still pursuing their cases through the courts, arguing that the \u201caccommodation\u201d the administration designed for them still leaves them complicit in contraceptive coverage.\n\nHHS\u2019s new guidance, however, looked at the mandate from the perspective of female consumers.\n\nAmerica\u2019s Health Insurance Plans, the industry\u2019s top lobbying group, welcomed Monday\u2019s clarification.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s guidance takes important steps to support health plans\u2019 use of medical management in providing women with safe, affordable health care services,\u201d AHIP President and CEO Karen Ignagni said. \u201cHealth plans are committed to promoting evidenced-based decision-making and to ensuring all consumers understand how their coverage works.\u201d\n\nUnder the new rules, insurers must be willing to waive cost sharing if a doctor says a particular drug \u2014 brand-name or generic \u2014 is medically necessary, although such considerations are limited to serious considerations such as the severity of side effects.\n\n\u201cIf a patient simply prefers brand over generic, that wouldn\u2019t fit the bill,\u201d Ms. Lynch said.\n\nThe contraception rules were released as part of broader guidance on women\u2019s health services, including insisting on free screenings for women susceptible to certain types of cancer. Also, insurers cannot charge extra for anesthesia services provided with preventive colonoscopies.\n\nHHS said the rewrite would apply to future plan years, saying insurers could have argued they were using \u201cgood faith\u201d in more narrowly interpreting the current rules.\n\nMeanwhile, New York\u2019s top lawman tried to tackle the issue on his own, proposing legislation that would write Obamacare\u2019s coverage requirement into state law while piling on extra consumer protections \u2014 even to men.\n\nMr. Schneiderman said his bill would force every state-regulated health policy to cover all methods of FDA-approved contraceptives at no cost, akin to federal guidance, although consumers could also get a year\u2019s worth of contraception at a time.\n\nHe also said men\u2019s sterilization procedures should be covered without cost sharing.\n\n\u201cNew Yorkers should not be penalized by their insurance companies for using the birth control method that they and their medical provider agree is most appropriate for them,\u201d Mr. Schneiderman said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Obama administration on Monday ordered all insurers to provide IUDs, the contraceptive patch and other birth control free of out-of-pocket charge to all women, thereby rewriting the rules after reports that some insurance carriers were refusing to cover all types of contraceptives.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "The Obama administration on Monday ordered all insurers to provide IUDs, the contraceptive patch and other birth control free of out-of-pocket charge to all women, thereby rewriting the rules after reports that some insurance carriers were refusing to cover all types of contraceptives.", "title": "HHS rewrites Obamacare rules: Orders free birth control for all", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/may/11/obama-admin-orders-insurers-to-provide-birth-contr/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/11/16/11162014_obama-burwell8201.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/11/16/11162014_obama-burwell8201.jpg", "description": "The Obama administration on Monday ordered all insurers to provide IUDs, the contraceptive patch and other birth control free of out-of-pocket charge to all women, thereby rewriting the rules after re", "card": "summary", "title": "HHS rewrites Obamacare rules: Orders free birth control for all"}, "Author": "Tom Howell Jr.", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Health Medical Pharma, Social Issues, New York, FDA, Eric T Schneiderman"}, "article_summary": "America\u2019s Health Insurance Plans, the industry\u2019s top lobbying group, welcomed Monday\u2019s clarification.\n\u201cNew Yorkers should not be penalized by their insurance companies for using the birth control method that they and their medical provider agree is most appropriate for them,\u201d Mr. Schneiderman said.\nThe Supreme Court last year ruled closely held corporations do not have to insure types of birth control that violate their moral beliefs, and the Obama administration is expected to update its rules soon.\nThe contraception rules were released as part of broader guidance on women\u2019s health services, including insisting on free screenings for women susceptible to certain types of cancer.\n\u201cJust because a pill would be available for free doesn\u2019t mean that an insurer could refuse to make the ring available for free,\u201d she said."}
