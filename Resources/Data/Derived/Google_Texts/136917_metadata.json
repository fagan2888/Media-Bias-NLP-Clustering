Pittsburgh St., Greensburg, to serve a segment of the population that is often overlooked, administrators said.\n\n\u201cThey're making their rent, utilities and food,\u201d said George Vollrath, the clinic's executive director. \u201cThere's no money left over to see a doctor.\u201d\n\nThat can mean chronic diseases such as diabetes and hypertension go untreated, said Vollrath, 64, of Hempfield, a former principal at Hempfield Area High School and Wendover Middle School.\n\nThe clinic will offer family practice and chronic disease control to county residents ages 19 to 65 who don't have medical insurance and fall below 200 percent of the federal poverty level.\n\nIt will be a \u201creal blessing\u201d for people like Carol Smolka, who said she was laid off in November and can't afford to pay $100 for the blood testing strips she needs.\n\n\u201cI'm just treading water ... keeping the bills paid,\u201d said Smolka, 55, of Greensburg. \u201cI have no idea where my blood sugar is.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt's perfect timing with the economy the way it is,\u201d said the Rev. Henry Taliercio, associate pastor at Word of Life Ministries in Hempfield and the clinic's founder.\n\nOfficials at other clinics said they've experienced no decrease in need, even with the advent next year of a federal health care program created by the Affordable Care Act. Under the controversial program, most people who can must obtain health coverage by 2014 or pay a fee.\n\n\u201cWe've seen nothing but increases in need over the years,\u201d said Marilyn Weaver, a retired NASA employee who serves as the volunteer executive director of the Wesley Church Health Center Inc. in Connellsville as her way of giving back.\n\n\u201cObamacare will have no impact that we can see,\u201d she said. \u201cOur patients don't make enough to afford even that.\u201d\n\nThe clinic has been serving Fayette and Westmoreland counties for 20 years.\n\nIn Pennsylvania, about 30,000 patients made 100,000 visits to the state's 50 free clinics last year, said Peggy Dator, executive director of the Free Clinic Association of Pennsylvania. That number isn't expected to decline next year.\n\n\u201cOur feeling now is there is still going to be uninsured ... a lot of people don't know (the Affordable Care Act program) is coming,\u201d said Dator, who ran a free clinic in Doylestown for 17 years. \u201cThere will still be plenty of people who are going to need our help.\u201d\n\nNationally, about 2 million people, most of them uninsured, visit the nation's 1,200 free clinics each year, according to the National Association of Free and Charitable Clinics, based in Alexandria, Va.\n\n\u201cIt's a reflection that the economy is providing jobs but the quality of those jobs is lower,\u201d said Barney Oursler, director of the Mon Valley Unemployed Committee. \u201cThe pay is lower and the benefits aren't there.\u201d\n\nThat is fueling an increasing need for primary health care, he said.\n\nThe Majesty Care Clinic has enlisted 70 volunteers, including 25 physicians, through a largely word-of-mouth effort.\n\n\u201cPeople would call me and say, \u2018I want to be part of this,' \u201d Vollrath said.\n\nMost of its medical equipment was donated by Excela Health and came from Jeannette District Memorial Hospital, which closed in 2011. A few doctors also donated medical equipment.\n\n\u201cPeople really do care,\u201d Taliercio said.\n\nThe clinic, funded through donations, might one day offer dental, vision and chiropractic care, Vollrath said.\n\nPatients will be seen by appointment only, and no drugs will be kept on site.\n\nA bike ride fundraiser begins at the clinic at noon Oct.6. An open house will run from 2 to 4 p.m.\n\nFor more information, email majestycareclinic@gmail.com.\n\nCraig Smith is a staff writer for Trib Total Media.
