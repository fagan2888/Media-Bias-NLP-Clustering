Laurence Franks, who signed Danni Productions\u2019 application for the pilots\u2019 tax credits, is vice president for production finance at CBS Television Studios in Studio City, California.\n\nNow, the network plans to film its new series on location, in and around New Orleans.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m thrilled from a business standpoint that the tax credit exists,\u201d said Gary Glasberg, creator and executive producer of \u201cNCIS: New Orleans.\u201d But Glasberg said he was more excited about the prospect of filming in and around the city.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t replicate New Orleans and do it as well as I want,\u201d Glasberg explained. \u201cIt\u2019s such a unique part of the world that I feel very fortunate that we can film this there. Everything will be done in Louisiana.\u201d\n\nThis fall\u2019s new series will cover 13 episodes, Glasberg said. If successful, he said, the series will continue.\n\nChris Stelly, executive director of the Louisiana Office of Entertainment Industry Development, noted that the original \u201cNCIS\u201d already has run for 12 seasons, while first spinoff \u201cNCIS: Los Angeles\u201d has completed six seasons.\n\n\u201cIn general, the impact to the state and the city of New Orleans can be tremendous,\u201d Stelly added. \u201cIn terms of direct spending, a series with a five-to-six year run can be well into the tens of millions of dollars.\u201d\n\nStelly said audits for 13 past scripted television shows produced in Louisiana showed a combined total of $302.5 million for expenditures inside Louisiana. Those audited expenditures led to issuance of nearly $95 million in state film tax credits.\n\nAdded Stelly: \u201cThe secondary benefits that a successful show can have in terms of tourism, brand recognition, etc., is immeasurable. I look forward to \u2018NCIS: New Orleans\u2019 becoming a mainstay of network television and a vibrant part of our motion picture industry.\u201d\n\nSusan Brennan, chief executive officer of Second Line Stages in New Orleans\u2019 Lower Garden District, agreed with Stelly.\n\nSecond Line was the studio where FX filmed season three of \u201cAmerican Horror Story\u201d last year, and where that series\u2019 fourth season is currently in production.\n\nAlthough Brennan\u2019s company is not hosting \u201cNCIS: New Orleans,\u201d she welcomes that new series as \u201chuge for New Orleans. It will mean hundreds of steady jobs for local film crew, cast and production office workers in New Orleans.\u201d\n\nBrennan added support companies \u2014 such as lighting, trucking, lumber and paint supply, tent and generator rentals, prop houses and furniture rentals \u2014 \u201cwill all see a boost in their revenue from a substantial television production such as \u2018NCIS.\u2019 \u201d\n\n\u201cThese companies employ thousands of workers throughout the state,\u201d Brennan said. She said 15 such industry-serving firms are located at her studio complex, \u201cand many of them will service \u2018NCIS\u2019 over the run of the show.\u201d\n\nIn addition, Brennan noted, \u201c \u2018NCIS\u2019 has the potential to show New Orleans as a character basking in its beauty, with scenes of the Mississippi River, the bayous and the architecture, while capturing the music, the food, and the art and culture, which makes us so unique.\u201d\n\nMany of the benefits of such on-location production are fueled by the state\u2019s tax-credit program.\n\nStelly noted that no tax credit payments have been approved for either the new \u201cNCIS\u201d series or its two pilot episodes.\n\nIn both cases, Stelly explained, the television producers must submit a detailed and independently audited list of expenditures for review by his office.\n\nExpenses approved as a result of that review would be certified as valid and forwarded to the Louisiana Department of Revenue for payment of authorized tax credits.\n\n\u201cWe have not yet received an audit to verify any expenditures,\u201d Stelly said of the pilot episodes. \u201cWe have yet to receive an application for the first full season of \u2018NCIS: New Orleans.\u2019 \u201d\n\nBut CBS\u2019 application for tax credits for the pilot episodes illustrates two important points about television and movie production in Louisiana: Expenditures can be eye-popping, and the Bayou State continues to draw significant chunks of business away from California.\n\n\u201cNCIS: New Orleans\u201d continues a trend that FilmL.A. Inc., a Los Angeles nonprofit studying California\u2019s loss of such projects, criticized in March. FilmL.A. complained that Louisiana hosted the production of 18 live-action feature films last year, more than any other state, more than Canada and the United Kingdom.\n\nMovie-making expenditures in Louisiana totaled $750 million last year, FilmL.A. reported. That was fourth behind California\u2019s $1 billion, Canada\u2019s $887 million and the United Kingdom\u2019s $843 million.\n\nThe list of Louisiana\u2019s television series is growing, as well.\n\nBefore CBS brought \u201cNCIS: New Orleans\u201d to the state, there was History Channel\u2019s \u201cSwamp People;\u201d A&E\u2019s \u201cDuck Dynasty;\u201d FX\u2019s \u201cAmerican Horror Story;\u201d and HBO successes \u201cTreme\u201d and \u201cTrue Detective.\u201d\n\nAnd, last year, Fox produced \u201cSalem\u201d in Shreveport for WGN. Stelly said filming of a second season is set to begin at that Red River city this fall.\n\nPast television productions filmed in Louisiana include: \u201cMemphis Beat,\u201d two seasons on TNT; \u201cImagination Movers,\u201d three seasons on Disney Channel; \u201cCommon Law,\u201d produced by CBS for USA, one season; \u201cStar Crossed,\u201d produced by CBS and aired on CW for one season; \u201cSecond Sight,\u201d produced by CBS for USA, but did not lead to a season; \u201cRavenswood,\u201d one season on ABC Family.\n\nOther former Louisiana television productions were: \u201cThe Gates,\u201d one season on Fox; \u201cHound Dogs,\u201d a CBS pilot that did not lead to a season; \u201cThe Occult,\u201d an ABC pilot that did not lead to a series, and \u201cK-Ville,\u201d one season on CBS.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Baton Rouge, LA /News/Business/: Film tax credit applications for two pilot episodes of the new CBS series \u201cNCIS: New Orleans\u201d provide a hint of the dollars to come from full production of the television show scheduled to air this fall.
