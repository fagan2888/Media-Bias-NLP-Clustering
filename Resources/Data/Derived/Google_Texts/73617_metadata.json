U.S. officials say Jose Hawilla, the owner of the Brazil-based sports marketing firm, is one of four men who has pleaded guilty in the U.S. soccer corruption investigation involving bribes totaling more than $100 million. (AP Photo/Andre Penner) The Associated Press\n\nBy MAE ANDERSON, AP Business Writer\n\nNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 The U.S. Justice Department's targeting of FIFA, soccer's global governing body, has put a spotlight on the powerful role that marketing firms play in the global sports arena.\n\nSuch firms act like talent agencies: They work with athletes, teams and athletic associations to sign sponsorships and advertising deals. In some cases, they buy and resell media and licensing rights.\n\nBig names in the United States include IMG, which was acquired last year by talent agency William Morris Endeavor, and Learfield Sports.\n\nThe big four U.S. pro team sports organizations \u2014 the National Basketball Association, the National Football League, Major League Baseball and the National Hockey League \u2014 sell their broadcasting rights directly to networks. But for many other sports events \u2014 from college football to the Olympics to soccer tournaments \u2014 third-party agencies often handle the marketing and media rights.\n\nThe Justice Department's allegations against one such agency \u2014 Miami-based Traffic Sports USA, whose parent, Traffic Group, is based in Sao Paulo, Brazil \u2014 illustrate the potential for corruption.\n\nMost experts caution that, outside of FIFA , such corruption isn't likely widespread in the United States. Criminal violations are more likely when the third-party agencies buy rights in smaller countries and when government oversight is especially lax.\n\nHere's how the deals typically work:\n\nA sports marketing company will pay a set amount to acquire rights to a sports event. The company will then try to sell those rights at a profit to corporations and broadcasters.\n\n\"If I'm a university producing a soccer tournament, I don't have to sell sponsorships or produce a radio broadcast \u2014 I've outsourced all of that,\" said Jim Andrews, senior vice president at sponsorship research firm IEG.\n\nIn Traffic's case, according to authorities, executives paid FIFA officials bribes and kickbacks to ensure that Traffic acquired the media and marketing rights associated with soccer tournaments and soccer federations in the United States and other parts of the CONCACAF region \u2014 The Confederation of North, Central America and Caribbean Association Football, which is part of FIFA.\n\nFor example, according to the indictment, a Traffic executive paid the president of the Venezuelan soccer federation a $1 million bribe in 2007 to ensure that it kept its hold on TV and sponsorship rights for the Copa America, hosted by Venezuela that year.\n\nThe indictment alleges that in the 1990's, as soccer's popularity rose in the United States and rights to games became increasingly valuable, the schemes expanded.\n\n\"Over time, all of these major tournaments have gotten much more lucrative,\" Andrews said. \"Audiences are bigger, and you can broadcast to an international audience a lot easier than we could 20 year ago, which means a lot more money.\"\n\nTraffic is only one of several sports marketing agencies involved in the corruption, according to the indictment. Others include Full Play and Torneos y Competencias S.A., based in Argentina, and an unnamed marketing agency based in New Jersey.\n\n\"When you start dealing with huge amounts of money, it's natural that more and more people will want to try to get a piece of these deals,\" said Carlos Eduardo Silva, a marketing professor at the Mackenzie University in Brazil.\n\nHe added, though: \"These deals are much more exposed than they used to be, and it's a lot easier to scrutinize them.\"\n\nThe founder of Traffic Group, Jose Hawilla, pleaded guilty to numerous charges ahead of the indictment. Traffic Group's U.S. president, Aaron Davidson, is among those who have been indicted. Hawilla agreed to repay $151 million, $25 million of which was paid at the time of his plea.\n\nTwo security officers stood in front of Traffic's offices in an upscale Sao Paulo neighborhood Thursday, turning away reporters and television crews. No one without an appointment was allowed inside.\n\nCalls to the company went unanswered, and a law firm hired by Traffic didn't immediately return requests for comment.\n\nRiccardo Silva, founding partner of MP & Silva, a rival sports marketing agency not involved in any of the allegations, said it was frustrating to compete with Traffic in Latin America.\n\n\"We participated in some auctions with them, and we never won,\" he said. \"Objectively, we had a feeling that we could really never compete on items like the CONCACAF Champions League.\"\n\nIn 15 years of business, his agency never won any media or licensing rights from CONCACAF OR CONMEBOL, the South American Football Confederation, even though it won rights for federations in Asia, Europe and the Middle East, Silva said.\n\n\"Everyone knew there were preferential relationships between CONCACAF and Traffic, and between CONMEBOL and Full Play,\" Silva said. \"Now whether those relationships were built on trust and confidence or something else, I don't know. But it was clear that it was impossible to compete with them.\"\n\nDespite how widespread the bribery and kickback schemes appear to be in the indictment, corruption is not rampant in the sports marketing industry in the United States, suggested Carrie LeCrom, executive director of the Center for Sport Leadership at Virginia Commonwealth University.\n\n\"It's not something we've commonly seen,\" she said. \"There's some wining and dining as the price of business, but it's not as overt as offering people bribes.\"\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press Writers Andrew Dampf in Rome and Tales Azzoni in Sao Paulo contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"zone": "sports/articles", "keyword": "Collections: Sports", "title": "FIFA probe shines light on middle-man sports marketing firms", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 The U.S. Justice Department's targeting of FIFA, soccer's global governing body, has put a spotlight on the powerful role that marketing firms play in the global sports arena.", "title": "FIFA probe puts a spotlight on the role of Traffic Sports and other sports marketing firms", "url": "http://www.usnews.com/news/business/articles/2015/05/28/fifa-probe-shines-light-on-middle-man-sports-marketing-firms", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/38/e5c14f6b3f89f209b073e4e377b131/media:00d5cc0a1c0c4ed0bc1613bfcb07c04bBrazilFIFA.JPEG", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 The U.S. Justice Department's targeting of FIFA, soccer's global governing body, has put a spotlight on the powerful role that marketing firms play in the global sports arena.", "site": "@USNews", "card": "summary", "title": "FIFA probe shines light on middle-man sports marketing firms"}, "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "site": "news", "date_published": "May 28, 2015", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "page_type": "article", "keywords": "Collections: Top News,Associated Press,Collections: Business,Collections: Sports", "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 The U.S. Justice Department's targeting of FIFA, soccer's global governing body, has put a spotlight on the powerful role that marketing firms play in the global sports arena."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2199\"", "article_summary": "Others include Full Play and Torneos y Competencias S.A., based in Argentina, and an unnamed marketing agency based in New Jersey.\nMost experts caution that, outside of FIFA , such corruption isn't likely widespread in the United States.\nBig names in the United States include IMG, which was acquired last year by talent agency William Morris Endeavor, and Learfield Sports.\nPrivate security guards stand outside the headquarters of sports marketing company Traffic Sports, in Sao Paulo, Brazil, Thursday, May 28, 2015.\nBut for many other sports events \u2014 from college football to the Olympics to soccer tournaments \u2014 third-party agencies often handle the marketing and media rights."}
