The good news: From 2013 to 2014, the percentage of Texans without insurance dropped from about 22 percent to 19 percent. The bad news: Texas remains No. 1 in the nation for the total number of uninsured (more than 5 million) and has the highest rate of uninsured. A closer look shows that some areas, especially urban counties, are making a big dent in the number of uninsured, while others have low enrollment rates and stubbornly high uninsured rates.\n\nJoanna Wojtkowiak", "article_metadata": {"description": "We\u2019re getting a clearer picture of how the three-year-old health insurance law is faring in a state that\u2019s been extraordinarily hostile to it.", "og": {"site_name": "The Texas Observer", "description": "We\u2019re getting a clearer picture of how the three-year-old health insurance law is faring in a state that\u2019s been extraordinarily hostile to it.", "title": "What Obamacare Has Done for Texas", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 2111, "identifier": "https://www.texasobserver.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/201512-state-of-tx-big-obamacare.jpg", "height": 2200}, "url": "https://www.texasobserver.org/state-of-texas-what-obamacare-has-done-for-texas/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "We\u2019re getting a clearer picture of how the three-year-old health insurance law is faring in a state that\u2019s been extraordinarily hostile to it.", "title": "What Obamacare Has Done for Texas", "image": "https://www.texasobserver.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/201512-state-of-tx-big-obamacare.jpg", "creator": "@agarciaditta", "site": "@TexasObserver", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#000000", "robots": "noodp", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=417283609", "fb": {"pages": 21002115613, "app_id": 902538479865047}, "theme-color": "#ffffff", "msapplication-TileImage": "/mstile-144x144.png", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/texasobserver", "section": "Health Care", "tag": "Travis County", "published_time": "2015-12-08T08:43:08-05:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/texasobserver"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "obamacare, affordable care act, texas health insurance, health insurance, medicaid gap, texas medicaid,"}, "article_summary": "1 in the nation for the total number of uninsured (more than 5 million) and has the highest rate of uninsured.\nAs Obamacare enters its third year, we\u2019re getting a clearer picture of how the landmark health insurance law is faring in a state that\u2019s been extraordinarily hostile to it.\nThe good news: From 2013 to 2014, the percentage of Texans without insurance dropped from about 22 percent to 19 percent.\nThe bad news: Texas remains No.\nA closer look shows that some areas, especially urban counties, are making a big dent in the number of uninsured, while others have low enrollment rates and stubbornly high uninsured rates."}
