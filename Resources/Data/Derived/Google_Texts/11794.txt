After answering a slew of questions from reporters after Day 1 of training camp on Thursday, Peyton Manning turned the tables on the media, picking out one reporter in particular.

Enjoy this interaction between Manning; The Denver Post’s Broncos reporter, Mike Klis; and the rest of the media at Dove Valley:

Manning: “I just have one question. What does it take to get—I mean, a lot of you guys have been here for a number of years and I see you all kind of stand over here, have to get quarantined and roped off, but then I see a certain media member that has all access out there on the field. I noticed he had a very tight shirt on today. Is that why he gets the all access (laughing)?

“[Mike] Klis, I don’t want to see you in a tight shirt, but that might be what it takes to get out there. I didn’t mention Jay Glazer, but maybe that’s who I was talking about. I mean, all-access, gets to ride with the head coach, so I think it’s the tight shirt. That was a boys small today. Maybe think about that if you want more access until then I guess you are all going to be over here in your little quarantine. I have nothing to do with the all access thing. Like I said, I think it’s the boy medium who’s wearing the small.

“Last thing, I know you wanted to know the ball security thing. Did [Head Coach John Fox] give the answer?

Media: “Same as the green he said.”

Manning: “It’s a different color because of training camp, does that make any sense?”

Media: “So will it be green for the regular season?”

Manning: “It won’t be blue during the regular season, but it’s training camp. What color are they during training camp?”

Media: “Blue ball.”

Manning: “There it is.”
