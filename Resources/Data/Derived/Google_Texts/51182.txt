Butler County EMS is putting an emphasis on safety for its patients and employees.

Most people think that every time an ambulance goes out it uses red lights and siren. That's not always the case and there's a good reason why.

Butler County has for years used the national Emergency Medical Dispatch system or EMD. When 911 receives a call for an ambulance the caller is asked a series of questions that will determine whether EMS should go silent to a call or use red lights and siren.

"They'll dispatch is as an Omega response or an Alpha, Bravo, Charlie, Delta or Echo response with Echo being the most critical," said Captain Josh Whiteside with Butler County EMS.

On average there are about 4,000 ambulance crashes every year. Last year there were 33 fatalities in ambulance accidents. Chad Pore is the Butler County EMS Director

"Nationally what the statistics have actually shown, and a lot of research nationally, is running lights and siren saves very little time," said Pore. "Typically you save seconds. In some situations a couple of minutes."

So far the study has shown 98% accuracy in the 911 priority codes when compared to the triage codes when EMS checks the patient.

"The rate of crashes increases when he run lights and sirens exponentially so we definitely want to keep that as low as we can," Captain Whiteside said. "Data is showing that when the calls are prioritized to those levels they're not really an emergency or a true emergency and that way we can increase the safety of our crews, the public and the patients."
