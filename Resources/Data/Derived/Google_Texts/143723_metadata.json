Their examination of where and what people of the time were eating not only tells us a lot about them but also a lot about us.\n\nLesy\u2019s inspiration and original window into that world was a collection of menus held at the New York Public Library. It was assembled in the late 1800s and early 1900s by Miss Frank Buttolph, as she signed her name. When Lesy came upon the collection online, he was fascinated by both its visual appeal and what it said about America. \u201cThe stuff is so astonishingly beautiful,\u201d he said. \u201cYou think of the quality and the printing and the beauty of the illustrations, and you\u2019re just taken. Looking at the collection online, you can see the menus year by year.\u201d Lesy suggests clicking on the menu covers to see what lies within them. \u201cYou get the bill of fare, which can be quite astonishing. Looking through these brings the times to life. It\u2019s strange and wonderful and crazy.\u201d The collection can be viewed at the New York Public Library\u2019s Digital Gallery website.", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "The Santa Fe New Mexican", "description": "In his introduction to Repast: Dining Out at the Dawn of the New American Century, 1900-1910, author Michael Lesy quotes the 19th-century French epicure and philosopher Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin: \u201cTell me what you eat, and I will tell you what you are.\u201d Leslie and co-author Lisa Stoffer take that statement a step further, gaining all sorts of social and cultural insight into the first decade of the American century.", "title": "Eating history: What menus tell us about our forefathers and ourselves", "url": "http://www.santafenewmexican.com/pasatiempo/books/eating-history-what-menus-tell-us-about-our-forefathers-and/article_3fcab065-5089-57c5-b0a0-436981e5c0b8.html", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/santafenewmexican.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/0/f0/0f0b758e-68f3-11e3-a502-001a4bcf6878/52b363eeccbea.preview-600.jpg?resize=600%2C500", "height": 500}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@thenewmexican", "card": "summary"}, "description": "In his introduction to Repast: Dining Out at the Dawn of the New American Century, 1900-1910, author Michael Lesy quotes the 19th-century French epicure and philosopher Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin: \u201cTell me what you eat, and I will tell you what you are.\u201d Leslie and co-author Lisa Stoffer take that statement a step further, gaining all sorts of social and cultural insight into the first decade of the American century.", "fb": {"app_id": 1519422651719737}, "keywords": "wisconsin death trip,lisa stoffer,michael lesy,jean anthelme brillat-savarin,repast,california dreaming: form and color,jeremiah tower,chez panisse,alice water,charles ranhofer,bill kohlhaase,books", "news_keywords": "wisconsin death trip,lisa stoffer,michael lesy,jean anthelme brillat-savarin,repast,california dreaming: form and color,jeremiah tower,chez panisse,alice water,charles ranhofer,bill kohlhaase,books"}, "article_summary": "Lesy\u2019s inspiration and original window into that world was a collection of menus held at the New York Public Library.\nIt\u2019s strange and wonderful and crazy.\u201d The collection can be viewed at the New York Public Library\u2019s Digital Gallery website.\nWhen Lesy came upon the collection online, he was fascinated by both its visual appeal and what it said about America.\nLooking at the collection online, you can see the menus year by year.\u201d Lesy suggests clicking on the menu covers to see what lies within them.\nTheir examination of where and what people of the time were eating not only tells us a lot about them but also a lot about us."}
