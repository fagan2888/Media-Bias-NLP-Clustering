(Steve Marcus/Reuters)\n\nWith two Hispanic senators, a retired African American neurosurgeon and, soon, an Indian American governor from the South, the Republican primary field offers voters the most diverse pool of candidates in memory.\n\nStill, the GOP probably will continue to struggle to attract a significant number of minority voters, who will be key to the outcome of next year\u2019s election.\n\nDespite the racial and ethnic diversity of the candidates, their records and rhetoric on some important issues are largely at odds with minority voters.\n\nThe GOP field also includes former Hewlett-Packard chief executive Carly Fiorina, who in a recent speech suggested she was a conservative feminist alternative to Democratic front-runner Hillary Rodham Clinton. Although the GOP candidate won the white women\u2019s votes in the past two presidential elections, Obama ran up huge margins among women of color, which accounted for the double-digit gender gap between the parties.\n\nIn seeking to win the votes of the overwhelmingly white and conservative voters who make up the GOP primary electorate, Sens. Marco Rubio (Fla.) and Ted Cruz (Tex.), both of Cuban descent; retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson, who is African American; and Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, who is Indian American, probably won\u2019t be much help to the GOP\u2019s effort to close the gap with communities of color after losing badly among black, Hispanic and Asian American voters in the last presidential election. Jindal hasn\u2019t officially entered the race but is expected to do so soon.\n\nThe twelve Republican candidates who have thrown their hat into the 2016 US presidential race.

But that changed with the Democratic Party\u2019s New Deal programs and an ideological shift from moderate to conservative leaders in the Republican Party in the early 1960s.\n\nIn his 2012 reelection, Obama claimed 80 percent of nonwhite voters, including 93 percent of the black vote. Many voters of color differ with GOP candidates on issues such as the Affordable Care Act, immigration reform and raising the federal minimum wage.\n\nThe GOP is also still struggling with a long-standing perception that it is insensitive toward racial minorities, a struggle on display in the past few days as some Republican candidates either tried to avoid discussing race in response to the shooting deaths of nine black worshipers, allegedly at the hands of a young white man in Charleston, S.C., or came across as awkward when they did discuss it.\n\n\u201cWhat is the party\u2019s response to a community that\u2019s hurting?\u201d said Steele, who said the party also has not been outspoken enough in the ongoing debate over several deaths of unarmed black males. \u201cI think that\u2019s what, more than anything else, would begin to break the ice that still exists out there.\u201d\n\nIn the hours after the South Carolina shootings, the candidates responded with messages of condolence and outrage. But, except for Carson, who in a Facebook message acknowledged that \u201cracial based hate is still very much alive as last night so violently reminded us,\u201d some of the candidates avoided citing racism as a motive for the killings, even though the alleged shooter, Dylann Roof, is said to have acknowledged as much as he gunned down nine black people attending Bible study at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church.\n\nMost of the candidates attended the Faith and Freedom Coalition conference in Washington, which opened Thursday, where almost all of them mentioned the tragedy, either in their remarks to the group or with reporters in the hallways.\n\nFormer Florida governor Jeb Bush came in for harsh criticism on social media for telling a reporter \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d when asked whether racism was a factor in the slayings. But later, he, along with Rubio and Cruz, were describing the attack as \u201cracist.\u201d Cruz and Fiorina criticized Democrats for using the tragedy to raise the issues of race, gun control and the state-\n\nsanctioned flying of the Confederate flag in South Carolina.\n\nOn Saturday afternoon, Mitt Romney, the 2012 Republican presidential candidate, tweeted: \u201cTake down the #Confederate Flag at the SC Capitol. To many, it is a symbol of racial hatred. Remove it now to honor #Charleston victims.\u201d In response, some of the candidates expressed their personal discomfort with the flag but said the decision should be left up to the people of South Carolina \u2014 a states-rights argument that recalls the era when Southern states, chafing at federal anti-\n\ndiscrimination laws, asserted the right to govern themselves.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s an issue for the people of South Carolina,\u201d Mike Huckabee, the GOP presidential candidate and former Arkansas governor, said on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d\n\nThe Republican Party has worked to recruit diverse candidates and to train minorities to run campaigns, especially focusing on organizing get-out-the-vote activities. And individual candidates have made overtures to diverse communities; Rubio and Bush have specifically targeted Hispanic groups, where they often converse with potential voters in Spanish.\n\nCarson, who used to practice at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, returned to that city last month after unrest erupted following the death of an unarmed black man who was fatally injured in police custody. And for the past few years, Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) has visited historically black colleges and met with inner-city community leaders around the country to talk about racial disparity in the criminal justice system.\n\nStill, a Washington Post-ABC News poll in May showed that so far none of the GOP candidates were registering with minority voters.\n\nAmir Shawn Fairdosi, a political science professor at the University of Chicago, co-wrote a study this year that found that a push to put black Republican candidates on ballots for 2010 congressional races neither increased turnout nor yielded more black votes for the GOP.\n\nThe study was cited by several conservative columnists as evidence that the GOP should give up on trying to win over black voters. Fairdosi, who did the study along with Jon Rogowski, a political science professor at Washington University, said that wasn\u2019t the point of the paper.\n\n\u201cThe thrust of the paper isn\u2019t that the Republican Party can\u2019t attract black voters, but you just can\u2019t throw a black candidate out there,\u201d Fairdosi said. \u201cVoters are going to vote for the candidates that will do what\u2019s best for them.\n\n\u201cDemocrats start off with a platform more appealing to black voters than Republicans,\u201d he said.\n\nAnd, increasingly, with Hispanic voters as well.\n\nSylvia Manzano, a principal at Latino Decisions, which does polling and research on the Latino electorate, said Rubio and Cruz would have a lot of ground to make up with Hispanic voters.\n\nIn a Latino Decisions poll in November, 31 percent of respondents had a favorable view of Rubio. Cruz had a lower favorable rating at 25 percent. Larger percentages of Hispanic voters had no opinion of the two \u2014 40 percent for Rubio and 55 percent for Cruz \u2014 but their records suggest they\u2019d have a hard time winning Latinos\u2019 support.\n\nRubio and Cruz have called for repealing Obama\u2019s executive action on immigration. \u201cOver 90 percent of Hispanics think [the president\u2019s move is] a good thing,\u201d Manzano said. \u201cThat includes over 70 percent of Republican Hispanics.\u201d\n\nThey have similarly vowed to take on the Affordable Care Act, another initiative that has been popular with Hispanics.\n\n\u201cFor them to come and say, \u2018I\u2019ve been your champion\u2019 is really hard because there\u2019s not a record or policy accomplishments to point to,\u201d Manzano said. \u201cThe things they are well known for are things most Latinos don\u2019t agree with.\u201d\n\nTara Wall, a consultant with the Republican National Committee, said it was too early to predict what minority voters will do in next year\u2019s election. She noted that in the 2014 midterms, some GOP candidates garnered a higher-than-usual percentage of the black vote, including Ohio Gov. John Kasich, who boasted 26 percent of the black vote in his reelection bid.\n\n\u201cThe party has long recognized that we have to do better and we will do better with minorities,\u201d Wall said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Even with the most diverse pool of candidates in memory, Republicans are still struggling with a long-standing perception that they are insensitive toward racial minorities.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=678837008", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Even with the most diverse pool of candidates in memory, Republicans are still struggling with a long-standing perception that they are insensitive toward racial minorities.", "title": "Can diverse faces in GOP field sway minority voters?", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/gop-field-is-most-diverse-in-memory-but-will-minority-voters-be-swayed/2015/06/21/a6d531e4-1832-11e5-ab92-c75ae6ab94b5_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2015/06/21/National-Politics/Images/Was8936396-4518.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@wapovanessa"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/gop-field-is-most-diverse-in-memory-but-will-minority-voters-be-swayed/2015/06/21/a6d531e4-1832-11e5-ab92-c75ae6ab94b5_story.html", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=678837008"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "eomportal-uuid": "a6d531e4-1832-11e5-ab92-c75ae6ab94b5"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3774\"", "article_summary": "Still, a Washington Post-ABC News poll in May showed that so far none of the GOP candidates were registering with minority voters.\nHistorically, black voters had allied themselves with the Republican Party because it, led by President Abraham Lincoln, pushed to end slavery.\n\u201cDemocrats start off with a platform more appealing to black voters than Republicans,\u201d he said.\nThe study was cited by several conservative columnists as evidence that the GOP should give up on trying to win over black voters.\nOn Saturday afternoon, Mitt Romney, the 2012 Republican presidential candidate, tweeted: \u201cTake down the #Confederate Flag at the SC Capitol."}
