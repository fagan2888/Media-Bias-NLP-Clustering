(AP) - It\u2019s been nearly five months since a fire broke out in Harpers Ferry that devastated its historic commercial district and caused millions of dollars in damages. Residents and nearby fire departments swarmed the town\u2019s streets in the early hours of the morning to do what they could to contain the fire. Nearly eight hours later, the fire was put out but left behind the wood and stone frames of four buildings, some which were built before the Civil War.\n\nSince that day, the town of Harpers Ferry has moved quickly toward recovery and is getting close to rebuilding. West Virginia Public Broadcasting has been following this story since the fire; here\u2019s a look at how things are going now as 2015 comes to a close.\n\nIt was just around 3:15 in the morning on July 23 when property owner, Barbara Pusateri woke to her phone ringing.\n\nShe lives in Charles Town, about ten miles away from Harpers Ferry, where one of her buildings had been caught in an early morning fire.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m thinking this is just a minor thing,\u201d Pusateri remembered, \u201cthat somebody started some kind of a little campfire on the pavilion maybe or something, the fire department got it out, everything\u2019s fine.\u201d\n\nBut everything wasn\u2019t fine. Pusateri says after making a few more phone calls, she went to the internet to find out more. That\u2019s where she saw a video of the Harpers Ferry fire.\n\n\u201cAnd on the video, I can see it crossing rapidly across over toward my building and then going down the stairway and up the stairway with huge amount of speed and heat and huge flames, and my building immediately started to catch fire,\u201d she said.\n\nPusateri\u2019s building was one of four that caught fire in July. It housed five of the nine businesses destroyed by the blaze and the two apartments.\n\nOne of those businesses was Cindi Dunn\u2019s small boutique, The Vintage Lady.\n\nDunn was one of two shop owners who were able to reopen at a new location in Harpers Ferry after the fire. She opened the \u201cnew\u201d Vintage Lady just a few feet up the street from her previous location on Labor Day weekend.\n\n\u201cAnd it\u2019s been different here, but it\u2019s been a good different,\u201d Dunn said, \u201cWe love it. We love the space. We love the response that people have had, and we feel like things have fallen pretty much into place.\u201d\n\nAfter the fire, the entire town felt an outpouring of support from local communities, state and federal legislators, neighboring states, and even from around the world.\n\nThen in September, West Virginia University\u2019s Extension Service stepped forward and provided aid by way of contractors and other experts to look over the damage and figure out the best plan for rebuilding and for the future of Harpers Ferry as a whole.\n\nDemolition began just before Thanksgiving, and Harpers Ferry Mayor, Gregory Vaughn, anticipates debris removal will be complete by January 2016. He also says property owners, like Barbara Pusateri, will be able to get their building permits by February if not sooner.\n\nAnd Vaughn says getting the buildings to look period again won\u2019t be difficult either.\n\n\u201cThe exterior of the four buildings, or the three buildings, the historic ones, escaped a lot of the damage,\u201d he noted, \u201cMost of the damage was inside, and although there was charring and burning, the wood is 1840, 1830, it\u2019s not your typical two by fours that you buy today that is quick growth wood. This wood is extremely durable.\u201d\n\nBoth Mayor Vaughn and property owner, Barbara Pusateri say they\u2019re unsure exactly how much the rebuilding process will end up costing, but both expect it to be pretty staggering considering the millions of dollars in damages.\n\nPusateri says the debris removal of her building alone cost $100,000 and says most of what she\u2019s paying for her rebuild is out of pocket or through her insurance.\n\nBut like the day of the fire, she says she\u2019s trying to stay positive through this process.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s still very depressing, especially at Christmas,\u201d Pusateri said, \u201cbecause all the buildings were probably the most beautiful during the Christmas season, and a lot of my friends have been sending me pictures of my building; how it looked a year ago, how it looked two years ago with all the decorations up, the shops all open, and looking at those, it\u2019s very sad, but then again, I know that, that same appearance, if not a better appearance is going to come in the future, and I just have to, you know, wait and be patient; that\u2019s the biggest thing.\u201d\n\nPusateri says she hopes she can begin moving in new tenants by summer 2016.\n\nThe cause of the fire is still undetermined and the investigation into its start is still ongoing.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: WVPR-FM, http://www.wvpubcast.org/news.aspx", "article_metadata": {"description": "It's been nearly five months since a fire broke out in Harpers Ferry that devastated its historic commercial district and caused millions of dollars in damages.
