Primary care doctors are relatively under-reimbursed, but still average approximately $220,000 in yearly compensation. Thus, doctors in well-run practices continue to make enviable wages by caring for Medicare patients.\n\nI agree with Dr. Forzley that the S.G.R. formula should be reworked to reward quality rather than quantity of care, but I also contend that shared sacrifice will be required by nearly everyone in health care, including most physicians, in order to make Medicare sustainable for the future.\n\nJAMES RICKERT\n\nBloomington, Ill., Sept. 11, 2013\n\nThe writer is president of the Society for Patient-Centered Orthopedics and an assistant clinical professor at the Indiana University School of Medicine.\n\nMy large, physician-owned group practice was forced to restrict new Medicare patients out of pure survival years ago.\n\nIt seems that Medicare is determined to make sure that only hospital-employed doctors can see Medicare patients, as they get paid far more for the same routine office visits. What non-hospital employed doctors get barely covers our overhead.\n\nNICK BENTON\n\nCorvallis, Ore., Sept. 11, 2013\n\nThe writer is a surgeon and president of the Corvallis Clinic.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAs retired seniors on a fixed income seeking continuity of care from Medicare-accepting physicians, my wife and I have been priced out by two (going on three) physicians from the clinic we have been using for many years. They have given us excellent service, but all are turning to \u201cboutique\u201d care that we cannot afford. They complain about Medicare payment delays.\n\nThe \u201cboutique\u201d plan requires patients to pay as much as several thousand dollars more per year to get the kind of care we thought all physicians promise when they take the Hippocratic oath. What\u2019s a Medicare patient to do?\n\nROD LOPEZ-FABREGA\n\nNorwalk, Conn., Sept. 11, 2013\n\nWhile I see only a few Medicare-insured patients, it is clear to me that the problem of controlling costs without distorting clinical standards is at the center of protecting Medicare\u2019s solvency.\n\nPhoto\n\nFee-for-service is seen to promote excessive care. While linking payment to outcome makes sense, it could easily make doctors reluctant to accept severely ill patients or those with complex conditions.\n\nSystems with health-maintenance-organization-style salaried doctors can compromise the sanctity of individual treatment decisions and give incentives for less active care.\n\nFinancial incentives cannot create sound medical practice nor Medicare solvency. Good care depends on doctors practicing with ethical and clinical priorities; bad care increases costs and suffering. If your doctor is primarily thinking of money, something is wrong.\n\nSARA HARTLEY\n\nOakland, Calif., Sept. 11, 2013\n\nThe writer is a psychiatrist and on the faculty of the U.C.B./U.C.S.F. Joint Medical Program.\n\nI am in complete agreement with Dr. Forzley. Congress must find a permanent, value-based solution to physician payments. But given Congress\u2019s propensity to neutralize any Medicare spending increase \u2014 and this fix will be a big one \u2014 the solution cannot come from further reducing hospital payments.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nUnder the Affordable Care Act, hospitals in the United States have agreed to take a cut of $155 billion in federal funds over the next decade, not including annual reductions in payments. Hospitals should not be further affected by modifications in physician payment.\n\nPAUL J. CONNOR III\n\nGreenport, N.Y., Sept. 11, 2013\n\nThe writer is president and chief executive of Eastern Long Island Hospital.\n\nIt is high time that Congress permanently fixed the Medicare physician payment formula. The annual angst that attends to this issue discredits Medicare in the eyes of physicians and demoralizes doctors and patients alike.\n\nWant to know where to get the money to pay for it? Require Medicare to negotiate what it pays for prescription drugs.\n\nJUDITH STEIN\n\nExecutive Director\n\nCenter for Medicare Advocacy\n\nWillimantic, Conn., Sept. 11, 2013\n\nUntil doctors are reimbursed at market rates, there will be \u201ccost shifting\u201d \u2014 to the rest of us, contributing to the upward spiral in health care costs. The \u201cphysician payment fix,\u201d which restores draconian cuts, only brings reimbursements back to abysmal levels.\n\nAnd where does money for the \u201cfix\u201d come from? Is it taken from other programs? Or is it borrowed, or just printed?\n\nNone of these solutions are good ones. Significant tax increases, and not just on \u201cthe rich,\u201d are needed to correct this badly underfunded program.\n\nALEXANDER GOLDSTEIN\n\nBrooklyn, Sept. 11, 2013\n\nThe Writer Responds\n\nThe responses confirm my assertion that, as a group, physicians want to ensure the accessibility and sustainability of high-quality care. The respondents \u2014 physicians, administrators and patients \u2014 seek greater clinical excellence, improved individual outcomes and affordable payment mechanisms that can sustain these improvements. Congress must commit to a revised reimbursement model.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAs Dr. Hartley states, physicians must focus on giving the best possible care to patients. But they must still run viable practices, repay significant educational debt and keep pace with medical innovations and improvements. Dr. Rickert notes that physicians, especially surgeons and other specialists, are comparatively bigger earners, and that a \u201cshared sacrifice\u201d is needed. Does \u201csharing\u201d mean across-the-board cuts? If so, what about family physicians who spend more time listening to patients and coordinating care among various specialists? Traditionally there is little reimbursement for these activities.\n\nSince the current payment model rewards procedures rather than consultative conversations, I contend that \u201csharing\u201d is better achieved through a fair reimbursement model that permits all physicians to have viable practices. There is no question that the sanctity of the doctor-patient relationship must be preserved. What Mr. Lopez-Fabrega and his wife have experienced is very unfortunate. As health care evolves, patients and ethics must be a physician\u2019s highest priorities.\n\nTrue reimbursement reform would provide the means for physicians to improve models of care, end the threat of cuts that could be debilitating to a small practice and allow all doctors to leverage their commitment to healing for the benefit of their communities.\n\nGREG FORZLEY\n\nLivonia, Mich., Sept. 13, 2013", "article_metadata": {"tone": "opinion", "ptime": 20130914142805, "twitter": {"description": "Readers suggest changes to how Medicare reimburses for care.", "title": "Sunday Dialogue: Medicare\u2019s Doctor Fees", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/15/opinion/sunday/sunday-dialogue-medicares-doctor-fees.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000002442581"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/09/15/sunday-review/15letters/15letters-thumbLarge.jpg", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/15/opinion/sunday/sunday-dialogue-medicares-doctor-fees.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000002442581", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/15/opinion/sunday/sunday-dialogue-medicares-doctor-fees.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "thumbnail_width": 75, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "opinion/sunday", "hdl_p": "Sunday Dialogue: Medicare\u2019s Doctor Fees", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "Sept. 14, 2013", "edt": "NewYork", "keywords": "Medicare,Doctors,Health Insurance and Managed Care,Prices (Fares  Fees and Rates)", "news_keywords": "Medicare,Doctor", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "SCG": "sunday", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "thumbnail_150_width": 150, "thumbnail_150_height": 150, "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "Readers suggest changes to how Medicare reimburses for care.", "tom": "Letter", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/09/15/sunday-review/15letters/15letters-thumbStandard.jpg", "thumbnail_150": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/09/15/sunday-review/15letters/15letters-thumbLarge.jpg", "description": "Readers suggest changes to how Medicare reimburses for care.", "CG": "opinion", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "Sept. 14, 2013", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "Letter", "article": {"section": "Opinion", "modified": "2014-08-07", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "tag": "Prices (Fares, Fees and Rates)", "published": "2013-09-14", "section-taxonomy-id": "AD8090D7-4137-4D71-84C8-70DA3BD89778"}, "thumbnail_height": 75, "slug": "l15dialogue", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20140807143657, "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/15/opinion/sunday/sunday-dialogue-medicares-doctor-fees.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/09/15/sunday-review/15letters/15letters-videoSixteenByNine600.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Readers suggest changes to how Medicare reimburses for care.", "title": "Sunday Dialogue: Medicare\u2019s Doctor Fees"}, "pdate": 20130914, "des": "Prices (Fares, Fees and Rates)", "articleid": 100000002442581, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "Sunday Dialogue: Medicare\u2019s Doctor Fees", "col": "Letters", "PST": "Letter"}, "article_summary": "My large, physician-owned group practice was forced to restrict new Medicare patients out of pure survival years ago.\nIt is high time that Congress permanently fixed the Medicare physician payment formula.\nPrimary care doctors are relatively under-reimbursed, but still average approximately $220,000 in yearly compensation.\nNICK BENTONCorvallis, Ore., Sept. 11, 2013The writer is a surgeon and president of the Corvallis Clinic.\nThe \u201cphysician payment fix,\u201d which restores draconian cuts, only brings reimbursements back to abysmal levels."}
