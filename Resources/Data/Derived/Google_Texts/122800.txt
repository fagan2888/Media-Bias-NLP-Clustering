BEIJING--China's target for economic growth this year remains in a range of 6.5% to 7%, the head of the country's top economic planning agency said Wednesday.

Growth in the world's second-largest economy decelerated to 6.9% last year, its slowest in 25 years, and economists widely expect the slowdown to persist this year.

"This year, we are fixing the economic growth target at 6.5 to 7%, and I believe we have the capability to achieve it," Xu Shaoshi, chairman of the National Development and Reform Commission, said at a media briefing.

The government will set a more precise target at its annual congress in March, he said. Its current five-year plan sets 6.5%-7% as the annual target thresholds, he said.

Mr. Xu described last year's gross domestic product growth as "perfectly normal" and "quite reasonable" as long as employment remained relatively full and prices relatively stable.

"We are not pursuing double-digit growth," he said.
