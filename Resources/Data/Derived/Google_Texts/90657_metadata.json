Trump\u2019s main competitor in the state, Ted Cruz, is stumbling. The next closest candidate, Marco Rubio, is a distant third. Everything seems to be coming up Trump \u2013 assuming he can get his supporters to turn out.\n\nAs Politico reports this morning, the Democrats are taking seriously the notion that Trump will be the Republican candidate and are duly collecting opposition research and prepping their lines of attack. The gist of what they\u2019re planning is to paint Trump as a next-level version of the 2012 hit on Mitt Romney \u2013 a heartless capitalist whose business decisions have hurt people:\n\nThe emerging approach to defining Trump is an updated iteration of the \u201cBain Strategy\u201d \u2014 the Obama 2012 campaign\u2019s devastating attacks on Mitt Romney\u2019s dealings with investment firm Bain Capital, according to a dozen Democratic operatives and campaign aides familiar with the accelerating planning inside Clinton\u2019s orbit. This time, Democrats would highlight the impact of Trump\u2019s four business bankruptcies \u2014 and his opposition to wage hikes at his casinos and residential properties \u2014 on the families of his workers.\n\nAs the Washington Post\u2019s Greg Sargent writes, this line of attack suffers from being right, but in the wrong direction. Trump\u2019s appeal is rooted in his promises to do unspeakable violence to the existing political order, he writes, and so \u201cit\u2019s unclear whether painting Trump as a con artist and a predatory capitalist would be enough, at least with a certain segment of voters.\u201d He\u2019s right, and I think this approach could actually backfire somewhat.\n\nYou have to be very careful in how you go after Trump. The attacks on Romney over his Bain Capital days were effective because Romney had presented himself as a genial, good-natured Mr. Fix-It who knew how to run a business and create jobs. In that light, pointing out that his company invested in businesses that outsourced jobs was a stinging hit on Romney\u2019s image. Trump, on the other hand, revels in the cutthroat nature of business \u2013 he\u2019s most famous for telling people that they\u2019ve been fired \u2013 and his image is built around the idea that he\u2019s a tough and impossibly shrewd businessman. To that end, he uses the politically thorny aspects of his business record to his advantage.\n\nTake China, for example. Trump lashes out against the Chinese constantly and complains that they\u2019re screwing us over and says he\u2019ll be so tough on China that all the jobs will come back and yadda yadda yadda. The obvious retort to all this is that Trump-branded products are made in China, and that Trump is contributing to the ruinous economic advantage that he says China currently holds over us. Trump won\u2019t deny that \u2013 he\u2019ll embrace it and then flip it to reinforce his own message.
