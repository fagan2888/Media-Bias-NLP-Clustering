And if a student gets sick or hurt on campus, they can be treated for minor injuries instead of waiting for a parent to pick them up, explained Helen Van, a nurse practitioner at the site.\n\nResearch conducted in 2005 showed that high school based health centers decrease the number of absentee students. Since then, there has been a growing trend to open school-based centers on campus, Ramos said.\n\nFHCCGLA collaborated with the Montebello Unified School District to transform two portable bungalows at Bell Gardens High School into a clinic and health resource center. The clinic operator will oversee the operation and has agreed to put up $500,000 to purchase medical equipment. They have also received a $333,000 New Access Point Grant from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, which is expected to renew annually as long as the Affordable Care Act continues to be funded, explained Ramos.\n\nThe city of Bell Gardens\u2019 high teen pregnancy rate played a role in the opening the clinic opened a few feet from the school\u2019s infant toddler center and teen parent program classrooms.\n\n\u201cThere was a growing population of pregnant teens in the community of Bell Gardens, that\u2019s how the need was addressed for this clinic,\u201d said Van.\n\nMontebello Unified already provides free childcare, parenting classes, counseling and encourages minors to graduate from high school though the California School Age Families (CAL-SAFE) program.\n\nDr. Albert Pacheco \u2013 FHCCGLA\u2019s former chief executive officer \u2013 previously told EGP the campus location would bring a clinic to an area of high need.\n\n\u201cIn this particular area of Los Angeles County there\u2019s a big uninsured, low-income population so there\u2019s a big need,\u201d he said when the center first received the grant in January 2013. There are also a large number of immigrants in the predominately Latino working-class community.\n\nThe clinic\u2019s close proximity gives students greater access to preventative measures such as condoms, and testing for sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) and pregnancy without a parent being present.\n\nIf a student is pregnant, they will be referred to FHCCGLA\u2019s Bell Gardens Family Medical Center for follow up care.\n\nSo far, many of the student visits to the clinic have been for the physicals required to play sports, Van told EGP.\n\nShe said the clinic is seeing a good mix of students and people from the area for everything from well-child visits to treatment for chronic and acute conditions such as diabetes and hypertension.\n\nThe obesity rate in Bell Gardens is on the rise, Van pointed out.\n\nThat corresponds with the findings of a 2015 UCLA Center for Health Policy Research study that found more than 32 percent of Latino adults in California are obese and 40 percent of Latino adolescents are either overweight or obese.\n\nA separate study found that sugar-sweetened beverages are the largest source of added sugar and are associated with increased rates of obesity and other chronic health conditions, such as type 2 diabetes.\n\nTo combat the problem, FHCCGLA in the past partnered with Bell Gardens High School and MUSD to encourage residents to eat healthier through the creation of school-based gardens, farmer\u2019s markets and other projects as part of the Campaign for a Healthier Bell Gardens.\n\n\u201cThe unique value of BGHS\u2019s school-based health center illustrated the creative collaboration of educators and health care professionals working together to address the multifaceted needs of our children, youth, and families,\u201d said MUSD Board Clerk Lani Cupchoy during the clinic\u2019s ribbon-cutting ceremony Sept. 15.\n\nServices offered at the clinic are provided on a sliding fee scale based on the patient\u2019s income and does not require any form of insurance. Fees start at $30.\n\n\u201cWe try to accommodate every patient,\u201d said Ramos, explaining that FHCCGLA staff work with patients to determine which programs they may qualify for to reduce costs. Some patients may not be required to pay anything if they qualify for the county\u2019s My Health LA program, which provides primary health care at no to cost to eligible Los Angeles County residents who are uninsured or un-insurable based on income or immigration status.\n\nA person\u2019s immigration status is never disclosed, said Ramos.\n\nNearly all students at Bell Gardens High School qualify for free or reduced lunch, a federal standard that is often used as an indicator of poverty. As a result, Ramos told EGP most students and patients qualify for some type of aid.\n\nThe clinic is currently open Monday through Friday, 1p.m. to 5p.m. The wait time \u201cis not bad at all\u201d and walk-ins are welcome, said Van. Ramos told EGP the goal is to eventually open the clinic from 8a.m. to 5 p.m.\n\nSince opening, the clinic has averaged about 6 patients a day, but has the capacity to see up to three patients an hour. Ramos told EGP the non-profit hopes in the near future to offer immunizations at the clinic.\n\n\u201cHaving a clinic on campus provides easy access to the community,\u201d she said. \u201cWe bring health care services to our patients.\u201d\n\nUpdated 10-16-15: To clarify Dr. Albert Pacheco is the former executive director of FHCCGLA. Raquel Villa is the new CEO.\n\n\n\nComments", "article_metadata": {"distribution": "global", "generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "robots": "follow, all", "language": "en, sv"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce05d\"", "article_summary": "Health Clinic Opens on Bell Gardens CampusBy Nancy Martinez, EGP Staff WriterStudents at Bell Gardens High School who have a doctor\u2019s appointment may no longer need to miss a day of class now that a new health clinic has opened its doors on the campus.\nFHCCGLA collaborated with the Montebello Unified School District to transform two portable bungalows at Bell Gardens High School into a clinic and health resource center.\nTo combat the problem, FHCCGLA in the past partnered with Bell Gardens High School and MUSD to encourage residents to eat healthier through the creation of school-based gardens, farmer\u2019s markets and other projects as part of the Campaign for a Healthier Bell Gardens.\nIf a student is pregnant, they will be referred to FHCCGLA\u2019s Bell Gardens Family Medical Center for follow up care.\nNearly all students at Bell Gardens High School qualify for free or reduced lunch, a federal standard that is often used as an indicator of poverty."}
