Three people have been released but the fourth has a more acute exposure.\n\nBrian Ferguson, a spokesman for Prince William County\u2019s Department of Fire and Rescue, says it\u2019s believed that the carbon monoxide build-up was caused by a malfunctioning appliance. \u201cThere are several different gas-fired appliances in the building that could have been the culprit.\u201d\n\nMany homes have carbon monoxide alarms but Ferguson says it\u2019s not clear if there was a carbon monoxide alarm in the building.\n\nThe odorless, invisible gas can be difficult to detect and its symptoms can mimic the flu \u2014 dizziness, runny nose, nausea and severe headaches.\n\nFerguson says a laundromat customer recognized others were showing the signs of carbon monoxide poisoning and called 911.\n\nCarbon monoxide is most commonly created by faulty fuel-burning appliances \u2014 like industrial-sized gas clothes dryers often used in laundromats. \u201cHaving those detectors so that you can early detect the carbon monoxide is absolutely essential in the home,\u201d Ferguson says.\n\nMontgomery County Fire spokesman Pete Piringer says the young, old, and those with weakened immune systems are most susceptible to carbon monoxide poisoning. \u201cTypically what happens is somebody goes to bed at night and they don\u2019t wake up because they\u2019ve been exposed to it.\u201d\n\nFollow @WTOP on Twitter and WTOP on Facebook.\n\n\u00a9 2015 WTOP.
