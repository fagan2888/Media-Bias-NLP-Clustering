Democrats have lost their way, preferring to walk a path of political correctness than proper policy, said HBO comedy host and frequent pundit Bill Maher.

“I am totally for political incorrectness, because that’s another way of saying truth,” he said in an interview with The Clarion-Ledger.

He then decried how many political watchers nowadays look simply for something that outrages them, and said those on the left were particularly guilty of such tactics.

“You know,” Mr. Maher said, “the Republicans are bad, but the Democrats are no prize either with this kind of bull[expletive]. … Where’s their big vision for America? it somehow got lost in the weeds of political correctness.”

Mr. Maher in recent weeks has gone head-to-head with those on the left who fail to recognize the realities of Islam and its inherent teachings about terrorism.
