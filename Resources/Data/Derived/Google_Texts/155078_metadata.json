And other products contain nutrients added voluntarily, pairing orange juice with calcium among other hybrids. But Berner and his colleagues wondered exactly how fortification of the grocery store aisle had impacted the nation\u2019s youth. Using data from a national survey, they analyzed the diets of more than 7,200 children and adolescents ages 2 to 18.\n\nOn average, teenage girls ages 14 to 18 were mostly likely to consume diets lacking inadequate nutrients, as measured by the \u201cEstimated Average Requirements\u201d set by the federal government. Much more likely to consume a healthier diet were boys and younger girls ages 2 to 8. Among findings, investigators say that half or more of the vitamins consumed \u2014 vitamin d, thiamin, and folate \u2014 came from fortified foods. Such added nutrients accounted for the consumption of 20 to 47 percent of vitamin A, vitamin C, riboflavin, niacin, B6, B12, and iron. By contrast, fortified foods contributed less in the way of zinc and calcium, with most of those nutrients consumed otherwise.\n\nMost important, fortification apparently does no harm. Foods with added nutrients did not appear to poison the body, as some have feared in past study, the study authors wrote in late January in the Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics.\n\nSource: Berner, Louise A., Keast, Debra R., Bailey, Regan L., Dwyer, Johanna T.
