Earlier this week, the Pentagon said it would wait and negotiate with Karzai\u2019s successor, who is expected to be elected in April.\n\nDOD took this step because Karzai has continually delayed signing the deal. Yet Karzai then tells America\u2019s most important European ally that he will sign the deal, making Berlin the go-between.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s being nicer to the Germans than he is to the United States. He has a good rapport with the Germans,\u201d said Lisa Curtis, a senior researcher at the Heritage Foundation. \u201cI don\u2019t see this as a breakthrough that Karzai is going to sign this imminently. He\u2019s saying it in a more diplomatic, kinder way to the Germans.\u201d\n\nRelated: Hamid Karzai - From Afghan Hope to Afghan Villain\n\n\u201cThumbing His Nose\u201d\n\nAs always, though, there was a twist. Just hours later, Karzai released 65 prisoners from Bagram Prison outside of Kabul. The U.S. has repeatedly objected to such a move, claiming that some of the prisoners have killed U.S. soldiers. But Karzai, speaking in Turkey, dismissed American concerns.\n\n\u201cAfghanistan is a sovereign country. If the Afghan judicial authorities decide to release a prisoner, it is of no concern to the U.S. and should be of no concern to the U.S.,\u201d Karzai said. \u201cI hope that the United States will stop harassing Afghanistan's procedures and judicial authority; and I hope that the United States will now begin to respect Afghan sovereignty.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. embassy in Kabul released a statement calling Karzai\u2019s decision \u201cdeeply regrettable.\u201d It said that the Afghan government \u201cbears responsibility for the results of its decision.\u201d It also urged the Afghan government \u201cto make every effort to ensure that those released do not commit new acts of violence and terror.\u201d\n\nRelated: Is Afghan President Hamid Karzai Off His Meds?\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s further thumbing his nose at the United States,\u201d Curtis of the Heritage Foundation said. \u201cHe obviously is extremely frustrated with the United States or feels it\u2019s going to gain him something politically by taking this hardline position.\u201d\n\nLosing Congress\n\nKarzai has already lost the White House. When director of National Intelligence, James Clapper, said earlier this week, \u201cI don\u2019t believe President Karzai is going to sign [the agreement]\u201d it sent a clear message that whatever was left of the well of trust between the Obama administration and Karzai had run dry.\n\nThere are now growing signs that even those within Congress who have supported the U.S. mission in Afghanistan are losing faith.\n\n\u201cPresident Karzai, in my view, is single-handedly destroying this relationship,\u201d Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC), a longtime supporter of continuing the Afghan mission, said Tuesday. He vowed to \u201cpush back as hard as possible\u201d against Karzai.\n\nSen. Carl Levin (D-MI), another politician who has backed the Afghan war, also appeared to be wavering in his support of Karzai. He said the Afghan president \u201chas made a series of statements so inflammatory that they are undermining public support in the United States for continuing efforts in Afghanistan.\u201d\n\nThe prisoner release will further damage ties between Washington and Afghanistan, according to Curtis.\n\n\u201cU.S. officials are quite ready to show him the door and he\u2019s really blown it in terms of any respect he might have had in Congress or the administration,\u201d she said.\n\nTop Reads from the Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "By releasing prisoners who killed Americans, Karzai has finally overplayed his hand with the Americans.", "title": "Karzai Overplays His Hand in Poker Game with U.S.", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/02/14/Karzai-Overplays-His-Hand-Poker-Game-US", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/02142014_Karzai_Poker.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/02/14/Karzai-Overplays-His-Hand-Poker-Game-US", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/02142014_Karzai_Poker.jpg", "creator": "@davidcfrancis", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "By releasing prisoners who killed Americans, Karzai has finally overplayed his hand with the Americans.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Karzai\u2019s statement to Steinmeier is his latest move in the seemingly endless game of poker being played between the United States and Afghanistan.\n\u201cHe\u2019s being nicer to the Germans than he is to the United States.\nHe\u2019s saying it in a more diplomatic, kinder way to the Germans.\u201dRelated: Hamid Karzai - From Afghan Hope to Afghan Villain\u201cThumbing His Nose\u201dAs always, though, there was a twist.\n\u201cIt\u2019s further thumbing his nose at the United States,\u201d Curtis of the Heritage Foundation said.\n\u201cPresident Karzai, in my view, is single-handedly destroying this relationship,\u201d Sen.
