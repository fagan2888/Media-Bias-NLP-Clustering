She wants to have a tubal ligation just after the baby is born, but Redding's Mercy Medical Center refused her request, citing religious reasons. ( Courtesy Lynsie Brushett via ACLU )\n\nRedding\u2019s Mercy Medical Center has refused \u2014 for the second time in four months \u2014 to allow doctors to perform sterilization on two pregnant women. The women requested the procedure be done immediately after they give birth next year. The hospital cited religious reasons.\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union and Physicians for Reproductive Health have sent a letter to Dignity Health, which owns Mercy Medical, saying they will go to court if the issue is not resolved by Wednesday evening.\n\nIn August, another woman, Rachel Miller, was initially refused her request for tubal ligation \u2014 commonly known as having \u201ctubes tied\u201d \u2014 but the hospital relented and approved the procedure, after the ACLU threatened legal action.\n\nDignity Health says its general policy is not to provide sterilization unless necessary for the \u201ccure or alleviation of a present and serious pathology.\u201d\n\nSince Miller\u2019s case was resolved, these two additional women have requested, in consultation with their obstetrician, tubal ligation to be performed immediately after they give birth.\n\nOne of them, 30-year-old Lynsie Brushett, is scheduled to deliver a second child in March. As the Sacramento Bee reports, her first pregnancy was difficult.\n\nHer son was born 12 weeks prematurely, and she developed severe pre-eclampsia. She said having a second child is all she can safely afford. \u201cIt was worth the risk, but I know my body can\u2019t handle any more pregnancies.\u201d she said. \u201cWe decided a tubal ligation was the best option to prevent any future unintended pregnancies, for my health and my family.\u201d\n\nShe said Mercy Medical, about 200 miles north of San Francisco, is the only place within 70 miles of her home that delivers babies.\n\nIn its \u201cEthical and Religious Directives for Catholic Healthcare Services,\u201d the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops specifically prohibits sterilization, even labelling it \u201cintrinsically evil\u201d:\n\n\u201cDirect sterilization of either men or women, whether permanent or temporary, is not permitted in a Catholic health care institution. Procedures that induce sterility are permitted when their direct effect is the cure or alleviation of a present and serious pathology and a simpler treatment is not available.\u201d\u2026 \u201cWhile there are many acts of varying moral gravity that can be identified as intrinsically evil, in the context of contemporary health care the most pressing concerns are currently abortion, euthanasia, assisted suicide, and direct sterilization.\u201d\n\nDignity Health is California\u2019s largest private health care system and owns 32 hospitals in the state. More than half are affiliated with the Catholic Church.\n\nCalifornia law allows Catholic hospitals to refuse to perform abortions but does not allow them to deny sterilizations. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists says the procedure is safe and used by about 600,000 women in the United States a year.\n\nThis post includes reporting from the Associated Press.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The ACLU is threatening to sue if Mercy Medical Center does not approve the procedure.", "contextly-page": "{\"title\":\"Catholic Hospital in Redding Denies Two Women Tubal Ligation\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/2015\\/12\\/07\\/catholic-hospital-redding-denies-women-tubal-ligation\\/\",\"pub_date\":\"2015-12-07 16:43:04\",\"mod_date\":\"2015-12-07 16:43:04\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":119887,\"author_id\":\"240\",\"author_name\":\"Lisa Aliferis\",\"author_display_name\":\"Lisa Aliferis\",\"tags\":[\"Contraception\",\"News\",\"Women's Health\"],\"categories\":[\"Tests &amp; Treatments\"],\"image\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/sites\\/27\\/2015\\/12\\/LynsieBrushett2-copy-e1449534356591.jpg\"}", "og": {"site_name": "State of Health", "description": "The ACLU is threatening to sue if Mercy Medical Center does not approve the procedure.", "title": "Catholic Hospital in Redding Denies Two Women Tubal Ligation", "url": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/2015/12/07/catholic-hospital-redding-denies-women-tubal-ligation/", "image": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/wp-content/uploads/sites/27/2015/12/LynsieBrushett2-copy-1440x1208.jpg", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@kqedhealth", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@"}, "fb": {"app_id": 160023622793}, "keywords": "contraception,news,women\\'s health", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "She wants to have a tubal ligation just after the baby is born, but Redding's Mercy Medical Center refused her request, citing religious reasons.\nIn August, another woman, Rachel Miller, was initially refused her request for tubal ligation \u2014 commonly known as having \u201ctubes tied\u201d \u2014 but the hospital relented and approved the procedure, after the ACLU threatened legal action.\n( Courtesy Lynsie Brushett via ACLU )Redding\u2019s Mercy Medical Center has refused \u2014 for the second time in four months \u2014 to allow doctors to perform sterilization on two pregnant women.\nIn its \u201cEthical and Religious Directives for Catholic Healthcare Services,\u201d the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops specifically prohibits sterilization, even labelling it \u201cintrinsically evil\u201d:\u201cDirect sterilization of either men or women, whether permanent or temporary, is not permitted in a Catholic health care institution.\nThe women requested the procedure be done immediately after they give birth next year."}
