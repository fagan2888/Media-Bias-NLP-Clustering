It\u2019s been a pattern. (AP Photo/Cliff Owen, File)\n\nRepublicans may control both the House and Senate, but any hope of enacting spending bills laden with conservative priorities \u2014 like defunding Planned Parenthood and Obamacare \u2014 will almost certainly die when budget negotiations begin in earnest later this year.\n\nThat\u2019s because the hardening reality on Capitol Hill is that for GOP leaders to avoid government shutdowns or debt defaults they need to rely on Democratic votes in both chambers. And the minority party isn\u2019t about to lend its support to bills containing policies it strongly opposes.\n\nIn fact, it\u2019s a scenario for which Democrats are already planning.\n\n\u201cThe question is what does it look like, and if they don\u2019t have the Republican votes to pass it, then hopefully we can have some influence over what is in that CR,\u201d House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said last month, referring to the stop-gap spending bill, or continuing resolution (CR), Congress is expected to consider before Sept. 30.\n\nDemocrats have gained leverage over spending bills in recent years because of the staunch opposition of fiery conservatives, particularly in the House, to supporting spending increases or raising the debt limit without getting something in return, such as budget cuts. The practical result: Republicans end up depending on Democrats to keep funding the government or raise the borrowing limit.\n\nThis same dynamic could be on display as early as the end of September, when government funding runs out.\n\nHouse conservatives are already making noise about opposing any bill that funds Planned Parenthood following the recent controversy over the use of tissue from aborted fetuses for research. At least 18 House conservatives have already vowed to oppose any spending bills that channel money to the embattled women\u2019s health group.\n\nIn the Senate, meanwhile, Democrats have shown they can unite to block any spending bills as they try to force Republicans to increase spending for domestic programs above the budget caps set by the so-called 2011 sequester deal.\n\nDemocrats say their starting point on negotiations remains increasing domestic funding by the same amount Republicans have proposed boosting military spending, a position they\u2019ve held for months. Some have also said they would like to try again to reauthorize the Export-Import bank.\n\nAny one of those items could cost Republican votes. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) will have to calculate just how many GOPers they are willing to lose to avoid a shutdown or debt default by making a deal with Democrats \u2014 a process that may be a bitter pill after months of refusing to even consider negotiations.\n\nThe likely reliance on Democrats also means Republicans will probably have to greatly scale back their efforts to use the appropriations bills to block or defund a slew of Obama administration initiatives, including environmental rules and the effort to renew diplomatic ties with Cuba.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time to come to the table, end the sequester, abandon poison pill riders, avert another shutdown and pass a bipartisan budget agreement that keeps America number one,\u201d Pelosi spokesman Drew Hammill said in a statement.\n\nBut an easy budget deal, as is always the case in Congress, isn\u2019t likely in the offing. Republican and Democratic aides said no formal discussions have taken place since lawmakers left town for the August recess, making it all the more likely that a short-term CR will be necessary to allow time for long-term negotiations.\n\nOf course, Republican leaders could decide to appease conservatives and attempt to pass funding bills that deeply cut domestic programs, slash funds for Planned Parenthood and strip dollars from Obamacare. But even that wouldn\u2019t necessarily guarantee them enough votes.\n\nPreviously, Republican leaders haven\u2019t been able to rely on their most conservative members on year-end spending votes or when increasing the debt limit. For instance, last year 53 House Republicans opposed a short-term CR that kept the government funded into December and then 67 voted against the year-end spending deal or \u201ccromnibus.\u201d On the debt ceiling, 144 House Republicans opposed raising it and ending the government shutdown in 2013 and 199 voted against a debt limit increase in 2014.\n\nThe path is not much easier in the Senate. Several conservatives, including Sens. Mike Lee (R-Utah) and Rand Paul (R-Ky.), have pledged to continue their fight to defund Planned Parenthood. Meanwhile, McConnell has already signaled a willingness to start budget negotiations when Congress returns after a month-long August recess.\n\nSome Republicans will likely be willing to increase some domestic spending and could potentially support another attempt to reauthorize the Export-Import bank. But GOP leaders will have a tough time securing enough votes to overcome a filibuster in what will be a lengthy process.\n\n\u201cEach side will have to give some things they don\u2019t want to give and we\u2019ll get to an agreement,\u201d McConnell said in July.\n\nCorrection: An earlier version of this post said 57 Republicans voted against the \u201ccromnibus\u201d bill in December.
