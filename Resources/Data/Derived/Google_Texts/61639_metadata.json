But it was while they were walking to their car in the parking lot when all three were hit by a SUV.\n\nIt\u2019s been a rough 24 hours for the family of the 3-year-old boy, who was hit and killed by an SUV on Wednesday. Originally, Oklahoma City Police said the boy got away from his mother during the accident, but his family says that's not the case.\"He was glued to her hip, so there's no possible way that he could've just took off. That did not happen,\" said Aaron Hughes, the uncle of little Isaac Gustafson.\n\nHughes said Gustafson was autistic and rarely left his mom's side.\n\n\"That's what makes this so hard to deal with is because, three days ago, I held the boy in my arms when we were all last together in Ponca City.\u201d\n\nHughes said his sister, Kandi Gustafson, said she took her two little boys to play on the McDonald's playground Wednesday on Northwest Expressway and Council. But it was while they were walking to their car in the parking lot when all three were hit by a black SUV.\n\n\u201cBoth tires ran over my sister and the children. I mean it's not like she hit them just a little bit and stopped, she ran just fully over the top of them and my sister does remember two sets of tires running over the top of her,\" he said.\n\nPolice say the 23-year-old driver didn't see them.\n\n\"She was distracted by another vehicle in the parking lot and something drew her attention to it. She just did not see the family crossing. It's a tragedy,\" said Capt. Dee Patty of Oklahoma City Police\u2019s traffic investigations unit.\n\nIsaac died at the scene. His mother has a broken ankle, a fractured knee and is wearing a cast. Isaac\u2019s brother, 4-year-old Daniel, suffered a few scrapes and bruises. Hughes says he remembers everything about the accident.\n\n\u201cSo my little nephew can explain it in detail. We don't like him to and we try to make him stop when he starts doing it,\u201d Hughes said.\n\nHughes said the family met at the medical examiner\u2019s office Wednesday and the death has been the biggest blow to their tightknit family.\n\n\u201cShe says you know what if I just picked him up and carried him like I always had. I was trying to let him be big and let him walk right next to me,\u201d Hughes said. \"When she woke up or got her consciousness back, the now deceased little boy was still locked in her hand.\"\n\nPolice say it was just a tragic accident and the driver was not cited though the investigation is still underway.\n\nThe boy's mother said she would like to talk to the driver to say she doesn't blame her for the accident.", "article_metadata": {"wn-build": "XSLT-7.1-17", "Description": "It\u2019s been a rough 24 hours for the family of the 3-year-old boy, who was hit and killed by an SUV on Wednesday.
