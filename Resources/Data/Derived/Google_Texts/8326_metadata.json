I don\u2019t have anything they can take from my pay roll.\u201d\n\nWhile Mayom\u2019s six children are covered under Medicaid, he and his wife have to look elsewhere, which is why he decided to attend a free health fair sponsored by Bridge to Care.\n\n\u201cBridge to Care is a student run organization that helps newly resettled refugees in the Omaha area find a way to get medical help,\u201d said Andrew Lemke, student president of Bridge to Care.\n\nThe organization is housed under the Service Learning Academy of the College of Public Health at the University of Nebraska Medical Center.\n\nThe group of students and volunteers have reached more than 2,500 refugees, according to Chelsea Souder, an Americorps representative for Bridge to Care.\n\n\u201cThe goal is to make them more self-sufficient and increase their access to care,\u201d Souder said. The camps and conditions that they are used to are 100 percent different from anything that we could ever imagine. A lot of the health services, such as vision and dental, they\u2019ve never even received or seen anybody for that.\u201d\n\nWhile most people have had routine tests to test blood pressure and blood sugar levels, it was a first for Mayom.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never gone for a test because I\u2019ve never had health insurance. I\u2019ve lived all these years without health insurance\u2013thanks to God that I\u2019m healthy since I came from Africa,\u201d Mayom said. \u201cToday they found my blood sugar was a little higher and my blood pressure is up a little bit. These are things that I know today and had never known this before.\u201d\n\nLauren Hinkle, a UNMC nursing student, helped Mayom navigate the health fair. She said assisting Mayom has her considering pursuing other avenues to help the refugee population.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t really realize how many refugees needed help. I\u2019m helping this gentleman out and he told me he\u2019d never had a blood pressure check and that\u2019s shocking to me because we\u2019re in the United States and we think that everyone gets that all the time,\u201d Hinkle said.\n\nMayom was able to sign up for the Affordable Care Act at the fair with the help of a representative from the Charles Drew Health Center. Although he has been able to find a steady job, buy a home and provide for his family, he said having affordable health insurance will make his life in Omaha that much better.\n\n\u201cPeople like us\u2026poor people like us\u2026refugees who have been in this country for a long time without insurance will be able now to get one. This is a good thing. I\u2019m personally happy for this to happen,\u201d Mayom said.\n\nAccording to the Refugee Health Technical Assistance Center, under the Affordable Care Act, refugees will enjoy the same benefits as U.S. citizens such as prohibiting lifetime benefit limits and rescissions. They will also be able to purchase insurance through exchanges and may qualify for premium tax credits to purchase coverage.\n\nComments are closed.", "article_metadata": {}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd82c8\"", "article_summary": "Refugee seeks affordable healthcareBy Ja'Nel JohnsonNovember 7th, 2013Omaha, NE \u2014 Andreya Mayom has lived in Omaha seven years without health insurance.\n[audio:http://www.kvnonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/FINAL_HEALTH_WP.mp3]According to the Office of Refugee Resettlement, refugees are given short-term health insurance called Refugee Medical Assistance, which is only available for up to eight months.\nAccording to the Refugee Health Technical Assistance Center, under the Affordable Care Act, refugees will enjoy the same benefits as U.S. citizens such as prohibiting lifetime benefit limits and rescissions.\n\u201cI have been living here without health insurance and my income is low and I can\u2019t afford the one from work,\u201d Mayom said.\n\u201cI\u2019ve never gone for a test because I\u2019ve never had health insurance."}
