In the large group market, the ratio is higher \u2014 insurers must spend at least 85 percent of premiums on health care and quality improvements.\n\nAny company selling health insurance in Delaware that fails to meet these standards will owe policyholders a refund. Rebates for individual market premiums are paid directly to the consumers, while those for small and large groups are paid to the employer who purchased those group plans.\n\nRebates may take the form of a check in the mail, a lump-sum reimbursement to a bank account (if the premium was paid by credit or debit card), or a direct reduction in future premiums.\n\nThe following chart provides a list of those insurers who owed rebates to Delaware consumers based on their Medical Loss Ratio for coverage year 2014. Any company not listed equaled or exceeded the MLR requirement:\n\n(Click on image above to view a larger, clearer image.)\n\n###\n\nRelated Topics:", "article_metadata": {"description": "Insurance Commissioner Karen Weldin Stewart announced today that insurers will issue more than $2 million in rebates to 14,399 health insurance policyholders in Delaware as a result of the Affordable Care Act\u2019s 80/20 Medical Loss Ratio rule.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "State of Delaware News", "description": "Insurance Commissioner Karen Weldin Stewart announced today that insurers will issue more than $2 million in rebates to 14,399 health insurance policyholders in Delaware as a result of the Affordable Care Act\u2019s 80/20 Medical Loss Ratio rule.", "title": "Commissioner Stewart: Health Insurers Will Rebate  More Than $2 Million to Delaware Consumers", "url": "http://news.delaware.gov/2015/12/04/commissioner-stewart-health-insurers-will-rebate-more-than-2-million-to-delaware-consumers/", "image": "http://news.delaware.gov/wp-content/themes/GIC-News-Theme-BS3/img/news-blog-og-image.jpg", "type": "article"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "msvalidate.01": "A3F8B5D5568E45A99F51D6C9A109B384", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Commissioner Stewart: Health Insurers Will Rebate More Than $2 Million to Delaware ConsumersDate Posted: Friday, December 4th, 2015Categories: Insurance Commissioner NewsDOVER, DE \u2013 Insurance Commissioner Karen Weldin Stewart announced today that insurers will issue more than $2 million in rebates to 14,399 health insurance policyholders in Delaware as a result of the Affordable Care Act\u2019s 80/20 Medical Loss Ratio rule.\nAny company selling health insurance in Delaware that fails to meet these standards will owe policyholders a refund.\nThe following chart provides a list of those insurers who owed rebates to Delaware consumers based on their Medical Loss Ratio for coverage year 2014.\nIn the large group market, the ratio is higher \u2014 insurers must spend at least 85 percent of premiums on health care and quality improvements.\nRebates for individual market premiums are paid directly to the consumers, while those for small and large groups are paid to the employer who purchased those group plans."}
