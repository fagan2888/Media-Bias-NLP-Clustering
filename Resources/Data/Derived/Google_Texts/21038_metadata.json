I accept it. Ted Cruz is a real nerd, and I hereby will stop gatekeeping his nerdery by presuming that he doesn\u2019t truly love all things sci-fi. Who am I to judge? Nerds come from all backgrounds! (And all political affiliations.) Given all of the nerdy references that this Republican Presidential hopeful has been dropping lately, it\u2019s become crystal clear that he\u2019s one of us.\n\nExcept \u2026 not. He\u2019s a nerd, all right, but I doubt Mr. Cruz scrolls through our RSS feed. The heroes that Cruz loves best\u2014Captain Kirk, Han Solo, Tony Stark, and even Rorschach\u2014are not exactly the same ones that we might list as our favorites. Still doubtful that those are really his heroes? Apparently, a teenaged Cruz used \u201cStark Enterprises\u201d as his inspiration for the name of his small business, \u201cCruz Enterprises.\u201d\n\nBut that was then! Maybe adult Cruz wouldn\u2019t take a cue from Tony Stark\u2019s masculine bravado. But he did recently compare Obama to the Terminator, and in a different speech, Cruz compared Obama to Darth Vader. Those are the villains that current-Cruz pictures himself fighting against.\n\nLet\u2019s analyze those references a little, as we nerds are wont to do.\n\nFirst off, the Terminator films clearly represent a fear of technological progress, as well as concerns that corporations don\u2019t actually care about people so much as they care about advancement at all costs. You might even say that the Terminator is the worst possible end result of that whole \u201ccorporations are people\u201d law. Except, that\u2019s not really Obama\u2019s deal, so I think Cruz must be more concerned about the \u201cunstoppable\u201d progress that Obama\u2019s actions represent\u2014especially given that Cruz used his Terminator analogy to criticize Obamacare. The response to universal health care can only be that we all hoard guns underground and prepare for the eventual apocalypse. Or \u2026 we all get affordable medical treatment, and the inexorable march towards technological progress continues unabated. Terrifying!!\n\nAs for the straightforward world of Star Wars, Darth Vader and Han Solo are two of the only characters who arguably show a little grey area in terms of morality; both men struggle with their own values over the course of the films, so it\u2019s actually pretty interesting to see Cruz use them as his basis for comparison. But the analogy doesn\u2019t hold water when you look at Cruz\u2019s background; given his well-connected parents, Cruz seems more like one born with an advantage (like the Force! of money, that is), rather than a scrappy outsider with few resources like Han Solo.\n\nAnyway, Han Solo isn\u2019t even the guy who confronts and eventually defeats Darth Vader. I guess Cruz comparing himself to Luke would have been even weirder, though, given the implications. As for whether Obama bears even the tiniest lick of similarity to Vader \u2026 that\u2019s such a stretch that it\u2019s hard for me to even know where to begin, so I\u2019ll leave that to you, commenters.\n\nThat was a fun analysis session and all, but Cruz\u2019s penchant for reframing nerdy media into conservative talking points is more embarrassing than it is endearing. The stories Cruz loves do make important political points, but it seems like Cruz is just picking and choosing what he thinks sounds cool to make a point, rather than considering the meaning of the media to which he alludes. Maybe his references will work for conservative nerds who like to picture themselves as the hero of a power fantasy \u2026 but they definitely don\u2019t work for me.\n\nI do have some idea of which sort of nerd these talking points might appeal to, though\u2014the kind of guy I avoid at conventions, who tells me that Batman had the right idea and that harassment policies are just needless hand-holding. We\u2019ve all met nerds like that, and they definitely are nerds. I guess Ted Cruz is trying to use his \u201cnerd cred\u201d to get their votes, but goodness knows those aren\u2019t the only nerds out there.\n\n(via Vocativ, image via Nation of Change)\n\n\u2014Please make note of The Mary Sue\u2019s general comment policy.\u2014\n\nDo you follow The Mary Sue on Twitter, Facebook, Tumblr, Pinterest, & Google +?", "article_metadata": {"description": "All right.
