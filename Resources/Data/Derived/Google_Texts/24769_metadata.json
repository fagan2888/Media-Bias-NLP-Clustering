The piece stated that fraternities \u201chave very little control over women who walk in the door carrying enough pre-gaming booze in their bellies to render them unconscious before the night is through,\u201d and suggested that intoxicated women should bear some \u201cpersonal responsibility\u201d for getting sexually assaulted by frat boys.\n\nDespite the suggestion being overwhelmingly panned, several of the hosts on Fox News\u2019 Outnumbered agreed with Frezza. A fear of drunk girls holding fraternities liable for sexual assault is \u201clegitimate,\u201d according to co-hosts Andrea Tantaros and Kirsten Powers.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know why this writer is taking so much heat, because this is actually a problem that goes on,\u201d Tantaros said. \u201cThese girls show up at these fraternity houses, and the guys \u2014 what are they supposed to do? Lock them out? \u2026 It is a legitimate fear.\u201d\n\nWell, locking women out is \u201cexactly\u201d what co-hosts Kennedy Montgomery and Sandra Smith agreed should happen, but doesn\u2019t because \u2014 as Frezza pointed out in his article \u2014 fraternities don\u2019t have policies in place to prevent inebriated guests from entering their houses. \u201cIf you\u2019re worried about liability, do what an airline would do,\u201d Montgomery suggested. \u201cThey either don\u2019t let drunk people on the plane, or, if you\u2019ve already been served, they\u2019re not going to serve you anymore.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t let them in the door in the first place,\u201d Smith added. \u201cCall somebody, get some help, don\u2019t let them in the door.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The hosts of \"Outnumbered\" think women need to start taking responsibility for getting drunk and sexually assaulted VIDEO", "title": "Fox News hosts agree with disgraced Forbes columnist: Drunk women do pose a grave threat to frat boys!", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The hosts of \"Outnumbered\" think women need to start taking responsibility for getting drunk and sexually assaulted VIDEO", "title": "Fox News hosts agree with disgraced Forbes columnist: Drunk women do pose a grave threat to frat boys!", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/09/25/fox_news_hosts_agree_with_disgraced_forbes_columnist_drunk_women_do_pose_a_grave_threat_to_frat_boys/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/09/Screen-Shot-2014-09-25-at-4.39.04-PM.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The hosts of \"Outnumbered\" think women need to start taking responsibility for getting drunk and sexually assaulted VIDEO", "title": "Fox News hosts agree with disgraced Forbes columnist: Drunk women do pose a grave threat to frat boys!", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/09/Screen-Shot-2014-09-25-at-4.39.04-PM.png", "creator": "@@JennyKutner", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Jenny Kutner", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, bill frezza, campus sexual assault crisis, college women, dudebros, Feminism, forbes, Fox News, Fraternities, fraternitiy life, it's on us, outnumbered, rape apologia, rape sexual assault, Sexism, victim blaming, Video", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda28f\"", "article_summary": "A fear of drunk girls holding fraternities liable for sexual assault is \u201clegitimate,\u201d according to co-hosts Andrea Tantaros and Kirsten Powers.\n\u201cCall somebody, get some help, don\u2019t let them in the door.\u201d\n\u201cThey either don\u2019t let drunk people on the plane, or, if you\u2019ve already been served, they\u2019re not going to serve you anymore.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t let them in the door in the first place,\u201d Smith added.\nDespite the suggestion being overwhelmingly panned, several of the hosts on Fox News\u2019 Outnumbered agreed with Frezza.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know why this writer is taking so much heat, because this is actually a problem that goes on,\u201d Tantaros said."}
