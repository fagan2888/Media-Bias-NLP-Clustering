State Rep. Matt Krause (R) believes that will allow a judge to hear both sides of the issue before making a decision about what to do.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll hear what the family wants, and you\u2019ll also give the pre-born child a chance to have a voice in court at that same time,\u201d Krause told the Dallas Morning News.\n\nThis issue sparked considerable controversy in Texas about a year ago, when the family of Marlise Machado Mu\u00f1oz was prohibited from removing her from a ventilator after she suffered a blood clot that rendered her brain dead. Mu\u00f1oz was about 14 weeks pregnant when she lost consciousness, and her family suspected that the subsequent lack of oxygen had severely harmed her fetus. They said Mu\u00f1oz never wanted to be kept breathing with the help of machines, and they wanted to say goodbye \u2014 but the hospital treating Mu\u00f1oz wouldn\u2019t comply.\n\nHospital officials said they were bound by an obscure state law that automatically invalidates a woman\u2019s end-of-life wishes if she is pregnant. That law stipulates \u201ca person may not withdraw or withhold life-sustaining treatment\u201d from a patient who is carrying a fetus. Mu\u00f1oz\u2019s family sued, arguing the law didn\u2019t apply in this case because Mu\u00f1oz was legally deceased and her fetus was no longer viable. They ultimately won their case and removed Mu\u00f1oz from life support.\n\nNow, almost exactly a year later, the issue may return to the forefront with Krause\u2019s impending legislation. The Mu\u00f1oz family isn\u2019t pleased. They told the Dallas Morning News they\u2019re offended by the way the bill will be framed \u2014 as if the state needs to appoint a lawyer for a fetus that doesn\u2019t have any other advocates.\n\n\u201cTo me that\u2019s saying that my family was not looking out for the best interest of Marlise and the fetus,\u201d her mother, Lynne Machado, said. \u201cWe feel our actions and decisions were based on what was best for both of them.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not unusual for state officials to appear in court to advocate on behalf of unborn children. As states defend harsh abortion restrictions against legal challenges, lawyers often argue that the policies are necessary because it\u2019s in the state\u2019s best interest to preserve the life of the fetus. And under overly broad \u201cfetal protection\u201d laws that allow states to prosecute pregnant women for using drugs, officials sometimes appoint legal representation for the fetuses but not for the women who carried them.\n\nSometimes, anti-abortion laws even explicitly stipulate that fetuses need lawyers. A particularly extreme parental consent law in Alabama, for instance, essentially puts pregnant teenagers on trial and forces them to make the case about why they need to have an abortion. The state is allowed to call witnesses to the stand to argue against the teen, as well as appoint a lawyer to represent the fetus. That law sparked widespread outrage, and even inspired a segment on the Daily Show during which correspondent Jessica Williams mocked a lawyer who\u2019s responsible for representing unborn children. \u201cYou have a crazy-ass job, sir,\u201d she told him.\n\nIn Texas, the state chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union is prepared to fight against Krause\u2019s effort to expand legal rights for fetuses. According to a 2012 report from the Center for Women Policy Studies, Texas is one of 12 states that allows doctors to disregard pregnant women\u2019s end-of-life wishes, and the ACLU has been trying to change those laws for years.\n\n\u201cThe minute you become pregnant, you no longer have the right to decide for yourself,\u201d Rebecca Robertson, the legal and policy director for the ACLU of Texas, told the Dallas Morning News. She said Krause\u2019s proposal would make things even worse.\n\nMachado, who says it was \u201ctorture\u201d to watch her daughter\u2019s body slowly decompose as she remained breathing with the help of a ventilator, plans to testify against Krause\u2019s bill if it ends up advancing in the legislature.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "It's the next chapter in an ongoing controversy over forcing pregnant brain-dead women to remain on life support.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "It's the next chapter in an ongoing controversy over forcing pregnant brain-dead women to remain on life support.", "title": "New Texas Plan Would Assign Lawyers To Fetuses", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/health/2015/02/09/3620796/texas-fetus-lawyer-brain-dead/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/shutterstock_138869051-e1412957473470.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "It's the next chapter in an ongoing controversy over forcing pregnant brain-dead women to remain on life support.", "creator": "@Tara_CR", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/shutterstock_138869051-e1412957473470-321x214.jpg", "title": "New Texas Plan Would Assign Lawyers To Fetuses", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-health", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/shutterstock_138869051-e1412957473470.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/shutterstock_138869051-e1412957473470.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2015-02-09T11:47:25+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/tculpressler"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc79f\"", "article_summary": "In Texas, the state chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union is prepared to fight against Krause\u2019s effort to expand legal rights for fetuses.\nHealth New Texas Plan Would Assign Lawyers To Fetuses CREDIT: ShutterstockIn the aftermath of a high-profile legal battle over a brain-dead woman who was kept on life support against her family\u2019s wishes because she was pregnant, one Texas lawmaker is readying a bill that would re-open the contentious debate.\nHospital officials said they were bound by an obscure state law that automatically invalidates a woman\u2019s end-of-life wishes if she is pregnant.\nThe Mu\u00f1oz family isn\u2019t pleased.\nSometimes, anti-abortion laws even explicitly stipulate that fetuses need lawyers."}
