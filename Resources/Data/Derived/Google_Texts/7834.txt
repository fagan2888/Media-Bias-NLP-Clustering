Vice President Joe Biden and his wife will attend the funeral of Officer Rafael Ramos, one of two New York City policemen killed in an ambush attack last weekend.

The White House said that the Bidens will attend the Saturday service at the request of President Barack Obama.

"The President has asked Vice President Biden to attend the service for Officer Rafael Ramos and is grateful that the Vice President and Dr. Jill Biden will be traveling to New York City to attend the service on Saturday," spokesman Eric Schultz said in a statement.
