He's displayed this time and time again, and again today writes that he feels no particular urge to be nice to people:\n\nFirst, picturesque language, used right, serves an important purpose. \u201cWords ought to be a little wild,\u201d wrote John Maynard Keynes, \u201cfor they are the assaults of thoughts on the unthinking.\u201d You could say, \u201cI\u2019m dubious about the case for expansionary austerity, which rests on questionable empirical evidence and zzzzzzzz\u2026\u201d; or you could accuse austerians of believing in the Confidence Fairy. Which do you think is more effective at challenging a really bad economic doctrine?\n\nWe writers and journalists shouldn't shy away from \"picturesque language;\" Krugman is right that when it's used correctly, writing - journalism and nonfiction, even - is much better to read.\n\nWhere he's wrong is his last sentence about \"effectiveness\" of challenging wrong ideas. We don't have to speculate or ask our readers about this. We have studies.\n\nIn a recent study, a team of researchers from the George Mason University Center for Climate Change Communication and several other institutions employed a survey of 1,183 Americans to get at the negative consequences of vituperative online comments for the public understanding of science\u2026 The text of the post was the same for all participants, but the tone of the comments varied. Sometimes, they were \u201ccivil\u201d\u2014e.g., no name calling or flaming. But sometimes they were more like this: \u201cIf you don\u2019t see the benefits of using nanotechnology in these products, you\u2019re an idiot.\u201d The researchers were trying to find out what effect exposure to such rudeness had on public perceptions of nanotech risks. They found that it wasn\u2019t a good one. Rather, it polarized the audience: Those who already thought nanorisks were low tended to become more sure of themselves when exposed to name-calling, while those who thought nanorisks are high were more likely to move in their own favored direction. In other words, it appeared that pushing people\u2019s emotional buttons, through derogatory comments, made them double down on their preexisting beliefs.\n\nThe use of \"picturesque language,\" in Professor Krugman's terminology, actually makes people less likely to be convinced by an argument. (Funny how Krugman's \"picturesque language\" always manifests itself in name-calling rather than, I don't know, landscape metaphors about Federal Reserve charts, but c'est la vie.)\n\nIn this way, incivility is not designed to actually convince anyone in argumentation. It's a performance art, designed to close minds, inflame passion, and rally your own troops (who are already on your side) to your side. One would think that a Nobel Prize winner in economics wouldn't need to name-calling - or at the very least, that he'd read the academic literature on the subject.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Esteemed New York Times opinion writer and Nobel Prize Winner Paul Krugman doesn't think it's necessary to be nice to people..05/26/2016 18:32:10PM EST.", "author": "Kevin Glass", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Esteemed New York Times opinion writer and Nobel Prize Winner Paul Krugman doesn't think it's necessary to be nice to people.", "title": "- Paul Krugman Is Wrong Today", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/kevinglass/2014/09/16/paul-krugman-is-wrong-today-n1892450", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2012/125/2012-05-04T210616Z_01_NYK508_RTRIDSP_0_KRUGMAN.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "Esteemed New York Times opinion writer and Nobel Prize Winner Paul Krugman doesn't think it's necessary to be nice to people.", "title": "- Paul Krugman Is Wrong Today", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/kevinglass/2014/09/16/paul-krugman-is-wrong-today-n1892450", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2012/125/2012-05-04T210616Z_01_NYK508_RTRIDSP_0_KRUGMAN.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Paul Krugman Is Wrong Today, Kevin Glass, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "He's displayed this time and time again, and again today writes that he feels no particular urge to be nice to people:First, picturesque language, used right, serves an important purpose.\nEsteemed New York Times opinion writer and Nobel Prize Winner Paul Krugman doesn't think it's necessary to be nice to people.\nThe use of \"picturesque language,\" in Professor Krugman's terminology, actually makes people less likely to be convinced by an argument.\nWe writers and journalists shouldn't shy away from \"picturesque language;\" Krugman is right that when it's used correctly, writing - journalism and nonfiction, even - is much better to read.\nWhere he's wrong is his last sentence about \"effectiveness\" of challenging wrong ideas."}
