Here\u2019s the latest.\n\nPhoto\n\n1. The Obama administration expanded its plan to cut greenhouse gases, proposing federal regulation to cut leaks of methane by the oil and natural-gas industry. The costs, which the E.P.A. estimated at $420 million over 10 years, could be more than equaled by savings, largely from reducing waste.\n\nPhoto\n\n2. Wildfires continued to rip through Washington, above, Oregon, California, Idaho and Montana, but the record toll of more than seven million acres so far this year is largely because of Alaska. Lightning storms there in June set off hundreds of fires that burned more than five million acres.\n\nPhoto\n\n3. Scott Walker, the Wisconsin governor, tried to reinvigorate his Republican presidential campaign by detailing his plan \u201cto once and for all repeal Obamacare entirely.\u201d He said he would make health insurance optional and offer tax credits to those who do not get it through employers.\n\nPhoto\n\n4. The F.D.A. approved a drug to enhance women\u2019s sexual drive, to be marketed under the brand name Addyi (pronounced ADD-ee).

Bryan Mitchell, the Yankees pitcher hit in the face by a line drive Monday night, was put on the seven-day disabled list for concussion. He suffered what the Yankees called \u201ca small nasal fracture.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\n7. Mayor Bill de Blasio said he was trying to stop seminude painted women from haunting Times Square. \u201cWe are going to look for every appropriate way to regulate all activity that involves either begging, or asking people for a contribution based on, you know, the opportunity to take a picture,\u201d he said..\n\nPhoto\n\n8.

China\u2019s economy was jolted again. Stocks dropped, with the main Shanghai index plunging by 6.2 percent, with no obvious catalyst. The news agency Xinhua said on Twitter that investors were \u201cin stampede again!\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\n10. A rape trial involving the elite St. Paul\u2019s prep school in New Hampshire focused on a sordid tradition, in which senior boys compete for intimacy with the most girls. A 15-year-old accuser testified that the 19-year-old defendant, who has acknowledged trying to win the game, assaulted her.\n\nVideo\n\n11. The Russian leader, Vladimir Putin, regularly offers the press opportunities to witness his strength, bravery and spirit of adventure.
