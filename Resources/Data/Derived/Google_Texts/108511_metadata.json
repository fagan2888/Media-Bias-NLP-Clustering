Authorities arrested 177 people after a shootout May 17 outside the Twin Peaks restaurant in Waco, and 143 remain jailed, many in lieu of $1 million bail.\n\nThe 177 bikers were arrested on allegations of engaging in organized crime, and critics have said that police lumped everyone under the same umbrella. They say that most of the people who were at the Twin Peaks aren\u2019t criminals and had no part in the shootout. Many jailed have no criminal record, and those who do have prior misdemeanor charges.\n\n\u201cI think they were trying to set an example, throw their weight around,\u201d Dwayne Stobaugh said Sunday morning of Waco police. \u201cThere may have been a few bad apples, but not all of them.\u201d\n\nStobaugh, an independent biker, said he wanted to ride to Waco for the rally to show \u201cthat not everyone who rides a motorcycle is a gang member, because we\u2019re not.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all peaceful protest,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re not there to stir up any trouble.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe said he has been to six Confederation of Clubs meetings, like the one planned at the Twin Peaks in May. He described the meetings as peaceful gatherings where members discuss issues important to them, like motorcycle safety.\n\nMel Robins, a member of Sons of Liberty Riders, said bikers are being unfairly stereotyped and harassed by police. He said the arrests in Waco have \u201cslanted public opinion against bikers.\u201d\n\nMany restaurants now have posted signs saying bikers wearing their club vests won\u2019t be allowed inside, and police are stopping motorcyclists on the highway for what seems like no reason, he said.\n\n\u201cBikers are basically regular people,\u201d Robins said. \u201cThey\u2019re doctors, lawyers. I\u2019m a grandfather, a veteran.\u201d\n\nThere are an estimated 300,000 bikers in Texas, and most of them aren\u2019t involved in criminal enterprises, as authorities suggested was the case in the Waco incident, Robins said.\n\nSeveral bikers gathered Sunday morning expressed concern for those still in jail. Many of those jailed are facing long waits for bond reduction hearings.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got innocent people in jail,\u201d Robins said. \u201cYou have ruined lives.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"liveFyreID": "aHR0cDovL3RoZXNjb29wYmxvZy5kYWxsYXNuZXdzLmNvbS8yMDE1LzA2L2xvY2FsLWJpa2Vycy1nYXRoZXItc3VuZGF5LWluLWFybGluZ3Rvbi10by1zaG93LXN1cHBvcnQtZm9yLXRob3NlLXN0aWxsLWphaWxlZC1pbi13YWNvLmh0bWwv", "generator": "WordPress 3.9.12", "author": "Tasha Tsiaperas", "og": {"site_name": "The Scoop Blog", "description": "Nearly 100 bikers gathered Sunday morning near the old Six Flags Mall in Arlington to show their support for the 143 people still jailed in connection with a shootout last\u2026", "title": "Local bikers gather Sunday in Arlington to show support for those still jailed in Waco", "url": "http://thescoopblog.dallasnews.com/2015/06/local-bikers-gather-sunday-in-arlington-to-show-support-for-those-still-jailed-in-waco.html/", "image": "http://thescoopblog.dallasnews.com/wp-content/themes/dallasnews/images/facebook-default-black.jpg", "type": "article"}, "LastModifiedDate": "2015-06-07T12:42:54Z", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image"}, "PublishDate": "2012-04-11T13:59:21Z", "wp-parsely_version": "1.7", "viewport": "width=device-width", "google-site-verification": "ZjZz-aaVcLkLDp8kIkLnEwtSTZlAwGgQhLyd1pXAbA8", "cXenseParse": {"recs": {"publishtime": "2012-04-11T13:59:21Z"}}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0f60\"", "article_summary": "Authorities arrested 177 people after a shootout May 17 outside the Twin Peaks restaurant in Waco, and 143 remain jailed, many in lieu of $1 million bail.\nNearly 100 bikers gathered Sunday morning near the old Six Flags Mall in Arlington to show their support for the 143 people still jailed in connection with a shootout last month outside a Waco restaurant.\nThey say that most of the people who were at the Twin Peaks aren\u2019t criminals and had no part in the shootout.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not there to stir up any trouble.\u201dHe said he has been to six Confederation of Clubs meetings, like the one planned at the Twin Peaks in May.\n\u201cI think they were trying to set an example, throw their weight around,\u201d Dwayne Stobaugh said Sunday morning of Waco police."}
