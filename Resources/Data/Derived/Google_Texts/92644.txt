Our bone health is an essential part of our overall well-being, but unfortunately it is often overlooked until it’s too late. For many, the “too late” mark is the onset of osteoporosis, a condition which causes bones to become weak and brittle.

As many as one in two women and one in five men are at risk for an osteoporosis-related fracture at some point in their lifetime. As reported by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the chances of having osteoporosis increase as you get older, and in the U.S., screening for the condition is recommended in women aged 65 and older.

Bone health isn’t just important for the elderly, however. That's why it's best to prevent bone problems while you're young. Keeping bones healthy is easy and involves our most favorite activity: eating. The hard part is knowing what foods are best to eat and which should be consumed in moderation. View the slideshow to hear Dr. Charles T. Price, medical director for the Institute of Better Bone Health, explain how we can eat our way to strong bones.
