It's understandable that Teresa Giudice wouldn't be a big fan of the courts. The Real Housewives of New Jersey star, 43, is currently serving a 15-month prison sentence at the Federal Correctional Institution in Danbury, Conn.

But on Saturday, June 27, Giudice took to Twitter to praise the Supreme Court of the United States' historic ruling to legalize same-sex marriage.

Finally some good news coming out of a court! #Justice&Equality4All #LoveWins â€” Teresa Giudice (@Teresa_Giudice) June 28, 2015

This isn't Giudice's first tweet from behind bars. On June 25, she wrote, "Thank you for your outpouring of support and for standing by me through this most difficult time. Love love love you all!"
