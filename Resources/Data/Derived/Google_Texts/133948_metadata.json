The opening brief in the lawsuit was filed late yesterday.\n\nThe Wills family is represented, free of charge, by Pacific Legal Foundation (PLF), a watchdog that litigates for limited government and property rights. Filed in Orange County Superior Court, the lawsuit is Capistrano Shores Property, LLC v. California Coastal Commission.\n\n\u2013 WATCH A TWO-MINUTE VIDEO ON THIS CASE\n\n\u2013 READ AN IN-DEPTH BACKGROUNDER\n\nThe Coastal Commission\u2019s illegal demand:\n\nThe Wills family must stop protecting their oceanfront home from the ocean\n\nEric Wills and his family wanted to replace an aging mobilehome that they own at Capistrano Shores Mobile Home Park, with a nearly identical, slightly smaller one. For that, the Coastal Commission insisted that they needed a \u201ccoastal development permit.\u201d As a condition for receiving a permit, the commission demanded that the family agree to never maintain, repair, or replace the seawall that safeguards their property and the 89 other homes in the 56-year-old park.\n\n\n\nAlthough the Wills went ahead with replacing their mobilehome, their lawsuit challenges this illegal anti-seawall condition.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe Coastal Commission is putting the security and the value of the Wills\u2019 home at risk, in violation of state law and the California and U.S. Constitutions,\u201d said PLF Attorney Larry Salzman, who is also Director of PLF\u2019s new Liberty Clinic at the Dale E. Fowler School of Law at Chapman University. Salzman and PLF took over the case after the Wills spent heavily in attorney fees fighting the commission on their own.\n\nThe commission\u2019s anti-seawall demand violates the Wills family\u2019s rights\n\nThe California Constitution (Art. I, Section 1) guarantees property owners the right to protect their property. Consistent with this, the California Coastal Act gives the Wills and other oceanfront property owners the right to safeguard their property with a seawall. It provides that \u201cseawalls . . . retaining walls, and other such construction . . . shall be permitted when required to . . . protect\u201d property from erosion and storms. (California Public Resources Code section 30235.)\n\n\n\n\u201cBy forcing the Wills family to surrender their right to protect their home as a condition for getting a permit, the commission is abusing its authority under state law and violating federal and state constitutional protections for property owners,\u201d said Salzman.\n\n\n\nCreated with flickr slideshow.\n\nThe Coastal Commission\u2019s misguided pursuit of its anti-seawall agenda\n\nThe Wills\u2019 lawsuit carries statewide implications, because the Coastal Commission has been pursuing a policy of \u201cmanaged retreat\u201d from the California coastline. \u201cBy depriving property owners of the shoreline protection they need for long-term safety and security,\u201d said Salzman, \u201cthe commission\u2019s policy will force many people to abandon their homes and businesses to erosion in the coming decades.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe law is clear,\u201d Salzman continued. \u201cThe commission may not prohibit coastal landowners from safeguarding their homes and property with shoreline protection devices that do not harm coastal resources. If the commission wants to remove property owners from their land instead, it should be required to pay them for their property.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cThe Coastal Commission is putting my family\u2019s home in danger, and eroding our rights in the process,\u201d said Eric Wills. \u201cWe are grateful that Pacific Legal Foundation has come to our aid, so we can fight back, on our own behalf, and for all coastal property owners in California.\u201d\n\nPLF\u2019s Liberty Clinic at Chapman Law School\n\nThis is the first Southern California lawsuit that features participation by PLF\u2019s new Liberty Clinic at the Dale E. Fowler School of Law at Chapman University. Under the direction of PLF Attorney Larry Salzman, an adjunct professor at Chapman Law School, this program trains aspiring attorneys in litigation techniques by giving them a hands-on role prosecuting property rights and economic liberty cases. Students devote approximately 10 hours per week to their cases and receive school credit.\n\n\n\n\u201cStudents in the clinic have an opportunity to participate in researching, meeting clients, assisting in the drafting of complaints and motions, and conducting discovery; they can even attend court hearings,\u201d said Salzman. \u201cThis is a unique program that gives students real-world experience and skills to help them move toward a career of defending limited government and liberty. I am proud to be part of this exciting project.\u201d\n\nThe just-filed brief, and background media material\n\nThe lawsuit is titled, Capistrano Shores Property, LLC v.
