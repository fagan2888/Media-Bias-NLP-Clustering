The woman\u2019s identity has not been released.\n\nThey met a third shoeshoer, who also has not been identified, at a trailhead and the three began ascending the 14,270-foot peak around 7 a.m.\n\nThe trio saw evidence of several previous avalanches along the way, said Tom Dale, a dispatcher for Clear Creek County Sheriff\u2019s Department. They were concerned about getting caught in an avalanche and took precautions, he said.\n\nThey decided to cross one particular ridge at about 12,000 feet in elevation one at a time as a precaution, Dale said.\n\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t want to expose all three of the group to a possible avalanche at the same time,\u201d Dale said.\n\nThe woman crossed the ridge first and watched as Thomas began crossing. The other two snoeshoers witnessed the avalanche as it swept Thomas down the mountain, he said.\n\nThe woman activated her beacon. Thomas also had a beacon and she and the other hiker used snowshoes and a shovel to dig in the area where they heard the signal, Dale said.\n\nIt took between 15 and 20 minutes to uncover Thomas, who was discovered about 1 \u00bd meters deep. He was not breathing and didn\u2019t have a pulse.\n\nOne of the hikers attempted CPR but was unsuccessful, Dale said. The woman called 911 at 10:46 a.m. on Wednesday morning.\n\nAlpine Rescue, the Clear Creek County Sheriff\u2019s Office, and Flight for Life were among the agencies on scene. This was the first avalanche fatality in Colorado and the third in the U.S. during the 2014-2015 winter season according to the Colorado Avalanche Information Center.\n\nKirk Mitchell: 303-954-1206, kmitchell@denverpost.com or twitter.com/kirkmitchell, denverpost.com/coldcases", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Victim of avalanche identified as 39-year-old Colorado Springs man", "title": "Victim of avalanche identified as 39-year-old Colorado Springs man", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/01/01/victim-of-avalanche-identified-as-39-year-old-colorado-springs-man/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "height": 630}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-01-01T17:14:21+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-01-01T17:14:21+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "This was the first avalanche fatality in Colorado and the third in the U.S. during the 2014-2015 winter season according to the Colorado Avalanche Information Center.\nA 39-year-old Colorado Springs man has been identified as a snowshoer who was killed by an avalanche Wednesday morning along a ridge in Clear Creek County.\nAlpine Rescue, the Clear Creek County Sheriff\u2019s Office, and Flight for Life were among the agencies on scene.\nThe trio saw evidence of several previous avalanches along the way, said Tom Dale, a dispatcher for Clear Creek County Sheriff\u2019s Department.\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t want to expose all three of the group to a possible avalanche at the same time,\u201d Dale said."}
