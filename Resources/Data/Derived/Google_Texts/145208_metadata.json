Among them is the town of Westport, which moved its event to July 7.\n\nWestport\u2019s program is designed and will be presented by Fireworks by Grucci, a six-generation family business that\u2019s world-renowned for its pyrotechnic artistry. WNPR\u2019s Diane Orson spoke with Phil Grucci, president and CEO, and asked about the kind of creative inspiration that goes into designing explosive displays.\n\nPhil Grucci: The creative part of our art form, if you will, is the fun part, frankly. As you realize with fireworks, it's an explosive. There\u2019s a tremendous amount of logistics and engineering that goes into any one of our performances. But the creative part is really inspired by whatever the celebration is.\n\nOne beautiful thing about our art form is it's surrounding a celebration of some sort, so it\u2019s always a happy event, for the most part. The creative aspect and the inspiration come from what that event is.\n\nThen we work with the stage, whether it's on a building, fired from a floating platform out in the middle of a body of water, [or] a beautiful land mass. That\u2019s our stage. We generate the soundtrack [and] choreograph the fireworks. Each of our fireworks are our performers, if you will. They\u2019re the palette that we work with to paint the canvas, the canvas being the night sky.\n\nIt used to be that you\u2019d see guys running around setting off fuses for fireworks, but that\u2019s not the case anymore. Can you talk about how computers have changed fireworks?\n\nWe utilize the technology as a tool in the discharge or the firing of the firework displays. In the past, you did see the pyrotechnician lighting the fireworks with a red railroad flare. We use many of our programs this Fourth of July. We'll have laptop computers out there, with electronic interfaces that\u2019ll connect to the fireworks themselves, and shoot the fireworks at tenth-of-a-second tolerances. Then we have the computer, where we\u2019ll utilize it as a tool in the design stages.\n\nIn the design phase, are you able to simulate what it will actually look like eventually?\n\nYes, we can do that to scale, and in a modeled atmosphere, which would be, for example, the rooftop of a building. We perform out on roof of Caesar\u2019s Palace out in Las Vegas every year on the Fourth of July, so we have a model of what the building looks like. We place, digitally, the fireworks on the roof of the building. Working with a soundtrack -- for Caesar\u2019s Palace for example, it\u2019s a 16-minute soundtrack made up of a number of patriotic and contemporary music scores -- we can visualize the particular firework effect we\u2019ve selected, for example, a golden palm tree during \"America, The Beautiful\" during a segue scene, we can visualize what that looks like, in scale, coming from the roof of the building.\n\nWhat is it about fireworks that so captures the imagination of people of all ages?\n\nI think it\u2019s the excitement; the power. Certainly, any firework display, it's very strong; it\u2019s bold; it's also beautiful. It's elegant. There\u2019s danger involved in it, so there\u2019s attraction to something that\u2019s that powerful and that dangerous, but yet harnessing that power to make it beautiful and creative, and being able to put a performance together. I think that excites most people.\n\nYou turn around, and you look at any audience, and they may be seven years old; they may be 47 years old, or 77 years old, and in those moments during the program, they all react the same way. That\u2019s a great beauty, to be able to have the ability to do that.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Arts/Culture", "description": "Wet weather in the forecast prompted some Connecticut towns to postpone their fireworks displays.
