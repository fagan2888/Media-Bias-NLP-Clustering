Others were gassed or killed by injection. But of all the ways to die at Mauthausen, Austria\u2019s largest concentration camp, one method in particular reflected the horrible cynicism of the Nazis in charge.\n\nAs emaciated inmates struggled up the 186 steps of \u201cthe Stairway of Death\u201d balancing huge blocks of granite on their backs, a guard would ask one if he would like to step out of the line to sit and rest for a minute on a ledge, recalled former inmate Aba Lewitt.\n\nOf course, most said yes.\n\n\u201cThe guard said, \u2018Well, then, sit over there\u2019\u2014 then he shot him,\u201d said Lewitt, tears welling in his eyes. \u201cHe said the inmate tried to escape the camp. That happened umpteen times every day.\u201d\n\nAustria marked the 70th anniversary of Mauthausen\u2019s liberation Sunday with somber speeches by dignitaries and funeral marches by scores of flag-carrying delegations from Europe and beyond. More than 20,000 people attended. The most powerful commemorations, however, were the stories told by some of the approximately 50 survivors present.\n\nOne of the longest-existing concentration camps in Hitler\u2019s Reich, Mauthausen received its first railway wagon of inmates in 1938. By the time it and its nearly 50 satellite camps were liberated by American troops in May 1945, more than 100,000 people had died, most in the main camp.\n\nThat main camp was designated \u201cCategory III\u201d \u2014 which meant its inmates were slated for death through labor.\n\nMany of the hundreds of thousands at the Mauthausen complex \u2014 Jews as well as prisoners of war, political prisoners, conscientious objectors and other opponents of Hitler\u2019s Nazi regime \u2014 built war planes and other military equipment in deep tunnels they dug at the auxiliary camps .\n\nBut the most unfortunate landed in its huge granite pit. Those assigned to 12-hour days of trying to climb the stairs \u2014 uneven slabs, some half a meter (yard) high \u2014 died from exhaustion, being shot or after being transferred to barracks for the sick, where lack of care and epidemics decimated the horribly weakened inmates.\n\nThe Nazis called the main camp \u201cThe Bone Mill.\u201d On Sunday, cows grazed on rolling meadows near tidy farm houses within eyesight of the forbidding granite walls of Mauthausen as people in nearby villages went about their business \u2014 a scene witnesses have described as not much different than Sundays past, as those inside the walls suffered and died.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Survivors recount Nazi camp horrors at liberation memorial", "title": "Survivors recount Nazi camp horrors at liberation memorial", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Survivors recount Nazi camp horrors at liberation memorial", "title": "Survivors recount Nazi camp horrors at liberation memorial", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/05/10/survivors_recount_nazi_camp_horrors_at_liberation_memorial/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/05/austria-mauthausen-memorial.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Survivors recount Nazi camp horrors at liberation memorial", "title": "Survivors recount Nazi camp horrors at liberation memorial", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/05/austria-mauthausen-memorial.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "George Jahn", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe264e\"", "article_summary": "That main camp was designated \u201cCategory III\u201d \u2014 which meant its inmates were slated for death through labor.\nBy the time it and its nearly 50 satellite camps were liberated by American troops in May 1945, more than 100,000 people had died, most in the main camp.\nBut of all the ways to die at Mauthausen, Austria\u2019s largest concentration camp, one method in particular reflected the horrible cynicism of the Nazis in charge.\nOne of the longest-existing concentration camps in Hitler\u2019s Reich, Mauthausen received its first railway wagon of inmates in 1938.\nThe most powerful commemorations, however, were the stories told by some of the approximately 50 survivors present."}
