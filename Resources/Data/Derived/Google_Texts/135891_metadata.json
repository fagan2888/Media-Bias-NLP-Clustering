Ted Cruz visits NH for the first time since announcing run for the White House.\n\nTexas Sen. Ted Cruz stood next to former New Hampshire House Speaker Bill O\u2019Brien on Friday and called Sen. Kelly Ayotte \u201ca friend.\u201d He also called embattled U.S. Rep. Frank Guinta \u201ca good man.\"\n\nTed Cruz Ted Cruz (R) is a candidate for president in 2016. More\n\nCruz would not say whether he agreed with O\u2019Brien that Ayotte should face a primary next year, saying that he is \u201cfocused on my own primary.\u201d\n\nCruz was questioned about calls by Ayotte and other top Republicans for Guinta\u2019s resignation in the wake of a finding by the Federal Election Commission that the New Hampshire congressman received excessive campaign contributions from his parents.\n\n\u201cThat is a question ultimately for the congressman to decide and for the voters here in New Hampshire to decide,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cI\u2019m certainly not going to insert myself into an issue of a local elected official.\u201d\n\nCruz added, \u201cI like and respect Frank. He\u2019s a good man. And I think ultimately, those questions will get resolved. But it\u2019s not my place to stick my nose where it doesn\u2019t belong.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Brien, a co-chair of Cruz\u2019s New Hampshire presidential campaign, has been critical of Ayotte in recent Facebook posts.\n\nAfter a member of Ayotte's senate staff was arrested in connection with a prostitution sting last month, O\u2019Brien wrote on Facebook that Ayotte was exhibiting poor instincts for backing legislation combating human trafficking while failing to condemn the staffer, who resigned.\n\nAnd when Ayotte voted to confirm Obama nominee Loretta Lynch as U.S. Attorney General, O\u2019Brien again criticized Ayotte, asking on Facebook, \u201cWhat is the difference between having a (Democrat) Jeanne Shaheen and a Kelly Ayotte in the Senate?\u201d\n\nO\u2019Brien called for someone \u201cof character\u201d to challenge Ayotte in a Republican U.S. Senate primary next year. But he said he would not be the one to do so.\n\nCruz has also had differences with Ayotte. In 2013, she demanded in a closed Senate Republican caucus that he disavow a statement from a conservative group friendly to Cruz attacking her and 24 other Republican senators for supporting a procedural vote that the group considered support for the Affordable Care Act.\n\nIn December 2014, Ayotte was critical of a move by Cruz and Sen. Mike Lee of Utah to force a series of votes related to overturning President Obama\u2019s executive action on immigration as part of a fight over a key spending bill. The move forced the Senate to delay its holiday recess.\n\nAyotte backed Republican Senate candidate Scott Brown over former U.S. Sen. Bob Smith during last year\u2019s Republican Senate primary. Smith is also a co-chair of Cruz\u2019s state campaign and was with Cruz and O\u2019Brien on Friday.\n\nStanding between the two Granite Staters, Cruz declined to say whether he believes Ayotte should be challenged in a primary next year.\n\n\u201cI like Senator Ayotte,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cShe\u2019s a friend. I think well of her. And I think it is incumbent on every elected official to make the case to his or her constituents that we\u2019re going to do the job we\u2019re elected to do. And so I will leave those suggestions to the voters of New Hampshire to determine that for every elected official.\n\n\u201cBut I\u2019ve certainly been very happy to work with Kelly on a number of issues, and I expect to continue doing so, working side by side,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m focused on my own primary,\u201d Cruz added. \u201cAnd I\u2019m focused on making the case that we need a proven conservative. Not just someone talking the talk, but someone walking the walk, standing up and fighting for conservative principles, for free market principles and our constitutional liberties, over and over again.\u201d\n\n(WMUR Political Director Josh McElveen contributed to this report.)", "article_metadata": {"category": "Politics", "ib-analytics": "data", "item-publish-date": "Fri, 29 May 2015 18:27:13 EDT", "generator": "ibPublish 2", "author": "John DiStaso", "og": {"site_name": "WMUR", "description": "Texas Sen.
