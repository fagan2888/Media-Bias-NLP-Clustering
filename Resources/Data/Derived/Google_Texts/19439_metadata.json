Doors opened yesterday at some tax offices, including Liberty Tax. It's looking like some people aren't slacking.\n\nHook says, \"We already had around 20 people in, so people are getting out early and getting their taxes done sooner than we've seen in the past.\"\n\nWhen asked when they do their taxes, some locals say they don't wait.\n\n\"Usually by the beginning of February.\"\n\n\"As soon as I get my W-2s so generally somewhere in the middle of January. I want to get it done as soon as possible.\"\n\nBut for many others, they don't get the deed done as quickly.\n\n\"Usually we try to start early, but we don't end up until April.\"\n\nThe IRS begins tax refunds on January 19th and Hook at Liberty Tax says there are plenty of benefits to doing your taxes early, but the main one? Getting your money back quickly!\n\nHook says, \"Getting your return done even before then gets it to their front door and they start processing those quick so you're going to get your money back a little quicker when you file early.\"\n\nHe also recommends going somewhere to have your taxes done so you don't miss anything and if you choose to do them yourself, maybe having a second pair of eyes look them over.\n\nHook says, \"Taxes are pretty complex so with the changes to the Affordable Care Act in recent years, education credits, children have lots of different credits as well. Sometimes you might miss something so we want to make sure people get all of their money back that they're due. Even if we don't prepare them, we'll review them to make sure that you didn't leave any money out there on the table.\"\n\nMistakes are pretty easy to make when working on your taxes.\n\nHook says, \"A lot of times simple addition is the big one. But also not knowing what's out there. If you're a college student, what credits you might be able to qualify for.\"\n\nSo whether you choose to get ahead of the game this tax season, or wait it out, keep some of these tips in mind.", "article_metadata": {"medium": "video", "description": "As much as you might not want to start thinking about taxes - you're going to have to.\nWith the new year underway, that means tax season is officially here.\nBlack Hills FOX reporter Heather Janssen has more.", "language": "english", "author": "Heather Janssen", "og": {"description": "As much as you might not want to start thinking about taxes - you're going to have to.\nWith the new year underway, that means tax season is officially here.\nBlack Hills FOX reporter Heather Janssen has more.", "title": "Tips to make for a successful tax season", "url": "http://www.blackhillsfox.com/home/headlines/Tips-to-make-for-a-successful-tax-season-364078451.html", "image": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/937/54B/93754B5BB9BC4FE584097EE99F6B4356", "video": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/504/DB4/504DB44F10264F4C934717C412DE41C8.mp4", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.blackhillsfox.com", "description": "As much as you might not want to start thinking about taxes - you're going to have to.\nWith the new year underway, that means tax season is officially here.\nBlack Hills FOX reporter Heather Janssen has more.", "creator": "@BlackHillsFOX", "url": "http://www.blackhillsfox.com/home/headlines/Tips-to-make-for-a-successful-tax-season-364078451.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/Taxes+1.jpg", "title": "Tips to make for a successful tax season", "site": "@BlackHillsFOX", "card": "summary"}, "video_type": "video/mp4", "video_height": 288, "keywords": "Tips to make for a successful tax season", "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "google-site-verification": "YxYD3UxJPp8Hk0T5apraugVs1Jdhf3RH0lWipEh29Ww", "video_width": 512, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Tips to make for a"}, "article_summary": "Doors opened yesterday at some tax offices, including Liberty Tax.\nThe IRS begins tax refunds on January 19th and Hook at Liberty Tax says there are plenty of benefits to doing your taxes early, but the main one?\nSo whether you choose to get ahead of the game this tax season, or wait it out, keep some of these tips in mind.\nGregg Hook with Liberty Tax says, \"It's that time of year where everyone needs their taxes done.\"\nAnother year, another tax season."}
