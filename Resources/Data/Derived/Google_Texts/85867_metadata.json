So why has a hotly debated bill to stop an Arizona Indian tribe from building \u2013 legislation that could cost $1 billion or more \u2013 again being scheduled for a suspension vote? One word: money.\n\nThe battle between the Gila River Indian Community and Salt River Tribe on one side, versus the Tohono O\u2019odham on the other, has been one of the Capitol\u2019s most expensive fights in recent years. The issue is a casino the Tohono has been planning to build in Glendale, Arizona, which would cut into the market share of the half-dozen Phoenix casinos operated by the Gila and Salt River tribes. Over the past two years, the Gila and Salt tribes have plowed more than $7 million into lobbying the battle; the Tohono, in a defensive crouch, has itself spent about $3.5 million more.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe spectacular outlays of cash generated by tribal lobbying were spotlighted in 2006 during the Jack Abramoff scandal. Congressional leaders promised reforms \u2013 at least until the issue fell off the public radar. But nearly ten years later, little has changed: tribes are showering Washington politicians with campaign cash in an effort to beat down rival nations. Indeed, over the last two years alone, the Gila and Salt River tribes have sent more than $75,000 each to the National Republican Campaign Committee. The Gila tribe, for good measure, gave the maximum to House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.), who has no dog in the fight, but happens to be steward of the suspension calendar.\n\nThis has proven an effective \u2013 and persistent -- strategy: Initially, McCarthy scheduled the bill to kill the Tohono\u2019s casino, HR 308, for a suspension vote on October 26. Notably, House Republicans were holding a high-dollar fundraiser with the legislation\u2019s supporters the very next day \u2013 with tickets running as high as $33,400.\n\nThe House Committee on Ethics has been critical of members whose conduct creates the appearance of special treatment for congressional donors. Indeed, the committee once admonished its own majority leader, Tom DeLay (R-Texas) for staging a fundraiser with energy companies just as a House-Senate conference on major energy legislation was set to begin. According to the ethics committee at the time, \u201ca Member should not participate in a fundraising event that gives even an appearance that donors will receive or are entitled to either special treatment or access.\u201d\n\nIn the case of the Tohono bill, lobbyists pointed out to Republican leadership that the timing of the fundraiser made for bad optics and the suspension vote was scrubbed. The bill\u2019s supporters realized that ripping a page from the DeLay/Abramoff playbook would be ill-advised.\n\nPolitical contributions aside, it's remarkable that the Republican lawmakers pushing this bill \u2013generally advocates of free markets and government frugality \u2013 would be agitating for such a quick, quiet vote. HR 308 contravenes not only earlier legislation \u2013 signed into law by President Ronald Reagan no less \u2013 but also numerous court and agency rulings upholding the Tohono\u2019s right to build its casino. Further, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has opined that if passed, this bill could cost taxpayers as much as $1 billion.\n\nThe Republicans are not in lock-step. For instance, Rep. Tom McClintock (R-Calif.) sent off a \u201cDear Colleague\u201d letter criticizing supporters for undermining the Tohono simply \u201cbecause other, wealthy interests don\u2019t want the competition.\u201d And the conservative blog Red State has called the bill \u201creckless legislation that will result in an unnecessary wasting of federal resources.\u201d\n\n\"The way I see it, we are essentially asking the American taxpayer to pay for special interest legislation designed to protect East Valley\u2019s tribes\u2019 gaming market,'' said Rep. Raul Grijalva (D-Ariz.), who has vowed to demand a roll call vote if it appears on the House floor under the fast-track rules of suspension. Not surprisingly, Republicans aren't keen to see their votes recorded in favor of legislation that could raise federal spending by $1 billion.\n\nRep.
