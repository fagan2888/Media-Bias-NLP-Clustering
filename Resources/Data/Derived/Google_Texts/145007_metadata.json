The blame game is already starting.\n\nGov. Mike Pence on Friday said news that a Carrier plant in Indianapolis and a United Technologies Electronic Controls plant in Huntington would close was \u201cdisappointing\u201d but ultimately said Washington was to blame\u2014a sentiment echoed by Connecticut-based UTC in its initial statement.\n\n\u201cWhile our administration continues to foster an environment within the state that is attracting record investment, federal regulations continue to stymie our national economy,\u201d Pence said in a written statement. \u201cThe fact that these companies are leaving the United States speaks broadly about the need for reform in our nation\u2019s capital.\u201d\n\nPence\u2019s spokesman did not immediately reply to IBJ\u2019s request for comment about which specific federal rule was problematic.\n\nBut Democratic U.S. Sen. Joe Donnelly blasted the assertion that federal rules were negatively affecting the Fortune 500 company, which has annual revenue of $56 billion and in 2014 accepted a $5.1 million taxpayer-funded federal tax credit.\n\nThe company said at the time the tax credit would help it \u201cexpand production at its Indianapolis facility to meet increasing demand for its high-efficiency gas furnace line.\u201d\n\nIndiana taxpayers have separately paid the company nearly $530,000 over the past nine years in economic development incentives, some of which the state says it will seek to recapture.\n\nDonnelly said he asked Carrier executive Chris Nelson to cite the specific regulatory issue.\n\n\u201cHe couldn\u2019t tell me a single regulation that was causing him any issue,\u201d Donnelly said Friday. \u201cThe only discrepancy so far is on the fact that the minimum wage in Mexico is $4.19 a day. It\u2019s certainly not that they\u2019re not making money and they\u2019re not succeeding. What they\u2019re trying to do is to sell heating and ventilation products to [Americans] but aren\u2019t willing to pay those same wages to the people who build the products.\u201c\n\nThe average wage for union members at the Indianapolis plant is about $23 an hour.\n\nAn official for Carrier Corp. told employees that relocating operations from Indianapolis\u2019 west side and Huntington to Monterey, Mexico, would \u201callow us to maintain high levels of product quality and competitive prices, and continue to serve the extremely price-sensitive marketplace.\u201d\n\n\u201cI want to be clear, this is strictly a business decision,\u201d the unnamed official said to a crowded room of employees, according to a now-rival video circulating on YouTube.\n\nEmployees boo in the video and even shout expletives at the employee.\n\nThe layoffs are supposed to begin in 2017 and continue until 2019.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Are onerous federal regulations the reason that Carrier Corp. and its parent company, United Technologies Corp., made the controversial decision to ship 2,100 jobs from Indiana to Mexico?
