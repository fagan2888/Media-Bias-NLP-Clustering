The deal covers Ottavino\u2019s remaining arbitration years.\n\nThe Rockies have not officially announced the deal, but are expected to do so on Monday. Jon Heyman of CBS Sports was the first to announce the deal. The contract calls for Ottavino to make $1.3 million in 2016, $2.1 million in 2017 and $7 million in 2018.\n\nOttavino, 30, is coming back from the Tommy John surgery he underwent on May 7. He is expected to be out at least a year, meaning he likely won\u2019t return to the majors until June or July in the 2016 season.\n\nDuring the winter meetings earlier this month in Nashville, Tenn. Rockies general manager Jeff Bridich said Ottavino was progressing nicely from his surgery, but added that it\u2019s too soon to but a timetable on Ottaviino\u2019s return. Bridich said it\u2019s possible Ottavino might not return until after the all-star break.\n\nUntil Ottavino returns, there is a good chance that recently signed right-hander Jason Motte will be Colorado\u2019s closer.\n\nOttavino emerged as a dynamic closer early last season. In 10 games (10 \u2153 innings) he allowed no runs, three hits, walked two and struck out 13. Opponents were hitting just .094 against him when he went on the disabled list on April 27 with right triceps inflammation. A week later it was determined that he need elbow surgery and his season came to an end.\n\nOttavino has a 3.88 career ERA in 194 career appearances, 189 of them with the Rockies.\n\nPatrick Saunders: psaunders@denverpost.com or @psaundersdp", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Adam Ottavino agrees to 3-year, $10.4 million deal with Rockies", "title": "Adam Ottavino agrees to 3-year, $10.4 million deal with Rockies", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/12/19/adam-ottavino-agrees-to-3-year-10-4-million-deal-with-rockies/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151219_023913_rockies-pitcher-ottavino.jpg", "height": 503}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151219_023913_rockies-pitcher-ottavino.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-12-19T14:36:19+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-19T22:30:52+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "The right-handed reliever with the put-away slider has agreed to a three-year, $10.4 million contract extension, a major-league source confirmed Saturday.\nThe contract calls for Ottavino to make $1.3 million in 2016, $2.1 million in 2017 and $7 million in 2018.\nOttavino has a 3.88 career ERA in 194 career appearances, 189 of them with the Rockies.\nThe Rockies have not officially announced the deal, but are expected to do so on Monday.\nAdam Ottavino is clearly a big part of the Rockies\u2019 future."}
