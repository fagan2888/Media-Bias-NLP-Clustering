Federal government dysfunction is #10 on our list.\n\nThe Big Story:\n\nDysfunction in the federal government disrupted life for many in central Pennsylvania\n\nAct I: The \"sequester\"\n\nThe threat of slash-and-burn, automatic, across-the-board spending cuts wasn\u2019t enough to get Congress to agree on a budget for this year. Those cuts, known as the \u201csequester,\u201d forced thousands of civilian workers at Central Pennsylvania defense facilities to take weeks of unpaid furloughs and slashed services for the needy, like Head Start.\n\nAct II: Government shutdown\n\nRepublicans in Congress forced a 16-day partial government shutdown in October as they tried to delay or defund the Affordable Care Act (aka \u201cObamacare\u201d). Thousands of Central Pa. workers again were forced off the job (although Congress later agreed to pay them) and the region\u2019s premier visitor attraction, Gettysburg National Military Park, closed. The fiasco put a $24 billion dent in the national economy.\n\nAct III: Unemployment aid expires\n\nCongress finally passed a budget in December, but facing implacable opposition by Republicans, Congress failed to extend unemployment benefits for those out of work more than 6 months. By the end of this month, this vital safety net will be yanked away from some 86,900 Pennsylvanians.\n\nThe Analysis:\n\nPennsylvanians are learning that the divided system of government created by the nation\u2019s founders in the Constitution has a downside. When voters in a polarized electorate entrust power to different factions in the House, Senate and presidency, it\u2019s difficult to get the routine business of government done.\n\nWhat we said:\n\nMay 31, 2013 Editorial\n\n\u201cThe exercise in federal budget blackmail known as the \u2018sequester\u2019 \u2026 has backfired and we're feeling the effects.\n\nThousands of civilian employees at the region\u2019s defense installations will endure unpaid furlough days, cutting their pay by as much as 20 percent through the end of September. \u2026 the furloughs will drain millions of dollars worth of economic activity from the mid-state.\n\nOct. 2, 2013 Editorial\n\n\u201cLeave aside whether you like or dislike the Affordable Health Care Act. The president and Senate are defending a law duly passed by both houses of Congress, signed by the president and upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court. [By provoking the government shutdown] the law\u2019s opponents in the House Republican majority are engaging in political blackmail.\u201d\n\nDec. 3, 2013 Editorial\n\n\u201cWhat afflicts the Capitol now is its inability to reach agreement or common ground on even the most basic of matters. \u2026\n\n\u201cThe cumulative effect of inaction and mismanagement that extends from one end of Pennsylvania Avenue to the other is the slow and steady erosion of public trust in government and its institutions.\n\nFeb. 13, 2013 Editorial\n\n\u201cObama was correct when he noted \u2018the greatest nation on Earth cannot keep conducting its business by drifting from one manufactured crisis to the next.\u2019\n\n\u201cBlame for that extends to both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue. The White House and Congress share equal culpability.\u201d\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"article_author": "PennLive Editorial Board", "medium": "news", "news_keywords": "13-for-13,government shutdown,sequester,unemployment", "title": "No. 10 - Federal government dysfunction hits central Pennsylvania: 13 for '13", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"No. 10 - Federal government dysfunction hits central Pennsylvania: 13 for \\u002713\", \"link\": \"http://www.pennlive.com/opinion/2013/12/federal_government_dysfunction_hits_central_pa_13_for_13.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://imgick.pennlive.com/home/penn-media/width620/img/opinion/photo/13963961-standard.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"11852830\", \"pub_date\": \"2013-12-22T16:18:46Z\", \"author\": \"PennLive Editorial Board\", \"tags\": [\"13-for-13\",\"@mobile\",\"@topstories\",\"government shutdown\",\"sequester\",\"unemployment\"] }", "twitter": {"image": "http://media.pennlive.com/opinion/photo/13963961-thumb_square_large.jpg", "description": "The \"sequester\" forced thousands of civilian workers at Central Pennsylvania defense facilities to take weeks of unpaid furloughs and slashed services for the needy, like Head Start.", "card": "summary", "site": "@pennlive"}, "article_date_updated": "Thursday, December 26, 2013, 12:38 PM", "parsely-metadata": "{\"image_url\": \"http://media.pennlive.com/opinion/photo/sequester-cartoonjpg-7a4de4dc1b617a8d.jpg\", \"author_name\": \"penned\", \"author_nickname\": \"PennLive Editorial Board\", \"author_id\": \"1828470\", \"source_blog_name\": \"Opinion\", \"source_blog_url\": \"http://www.pennlive.com/opinion/\", \"sponsored_content\": \"0\" }", "og": {"site_name": "PennLive.com", "description": "The \"sequester\" forced thousands of civilian workers at Central Pennsylvania defense facilities to take weeks of unpaid furloughs and slashed services for the needy, like Head Start.", "title": "No. 10 - Federal government dysfunction hits central Pennsylvania: 13 for '13", "url": "http://www.pennlive.com/opinion/2013/12/federal_government_dysfunction_hits_central_pa_13_for_13.html", "image": "http://media.pennlive.com/design/alpha/img/logo_penn.gif", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "PennLive.com", "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Sunday, December 22, 2013, 11:16 AM", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "Description": "The \"sequester\" forced thousands of civilian workers at Central Pennsylvania defense facilities to take weeks of unpaid furloughs and slashed services for the needy, like Head Start."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd7bd4\"", "article_summary": "What we said:May 31, 2013 Editorial\u201cThe exercise in federal budget blackmail known as the \u2018sequester\u2019 \u2026 has backfired and we're feeling the effects.\nAct II: Government shutdownRepublicans in Congress forced a 16-day partial government shutdown in October as they tried to delay or defund the Affordable Care Act (aka \u201cObamacare\u201d).\nThose cuts, known as the \u201csequester,\u201d forced thousands of civilian workers at Central Pennsylvania defense facilities to take weeks of unpaid furloughs and slashed services for the needy, like Head Start.\nStarting Dec. 18 and running through Dec. 29, PennLive Opinion will count down the top 13 policy issues of 2013.\nThousands of Central Pa. workers again were forced off the job (although Congress later agreed to pay them) and the region\u2019s premier visitor attraction, Gettysburg National Military Park, closed."}
