Andrew M. Cuomo in May, Mr. Brown strode onto Mr. de Blasio\u2019s turf for a public hearing about whether the minimum wage for the state\u2019s 180,000 fast-food workers should be raised above New York\u2019s statewide minimum of $8.75 an hour.\n\nWith just one exception, the first 30 people to testify at the hearing at New York University stated a common demand: They want $15 an hour, and they want it now. Many of them wore black shirts bearing the slogan \u201cFight for $15,\u201d a rallying cry that sprang from protests in New York City and spread across the country.\n\nNew York, once the standard-bearer for liberal ideas, now lags behind several areas of the country in mandating better pay for low-wage workers. Los Angeles, San Francisco and Seattle have all approved minimum wages of $15 an hour, or more.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. de Blasio and Mr. Cuomo, both Democrats, have pressed for higher minimum wages for the city and the state, but those desires have been thwarted by legislators in Albany. To circumvent the Legislature, the governor called for the creation of the wage board, which is scheduled to hold a series of public hearings and decide, by next month, how much the industry\u2019s minimum wage should be raised, if at all.\n\nAn increase would present the prospect of having a much higher minimum wage for workers at a McDonald\u2019s than at a Gap store across the street, though any increase is likely to be put into effect in steps. But economists say a mandatory increase for such a large swath of low-wage workers would create pressure on other employers to match it.\n\nMr. Cuomo has not said what he thinks the minimum wage for fast-food workers should be. But he has appeared at several rallies alongside those demanding $15 an hour.\n\nOn Monday, organizers of the \u201cFight for $15\u201d campaign turned out a large and vocal crowd that included pizza makers, cashiers, unionized graduate students, economists, a venture capitalist from Seattle and at least one rabbi.\n\nWith near unanimity, they took turns telling Mr. Brown and Mike Fishman, a fellow board member who is a union official, that they cannot support themselves or their families on the wages they receive, in some cases as low as $6.40 an hour.\n\nJason Rice, 31, who lives in Jamaica, Queens, said he holds three part-time jobs, including delivering pizzas for a Domino\u2019s in the Bedford-Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn. He said that he was paying $600 a month to rent a room and that his hours were so irregular it was difficult to set a budget and pay bills.\n\nAn increase to $15 is \u201cnot something that we can really afford to wait for five years for it to be phased in,\u201d Mr. Rice said.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t even afford to wait three years,\u201d he continued.\n\nRebecca Cornick, 60, said she took a job at Wendy\u2019s nine years ago and was still making just $9 an hour. She said she earned only two-thirds of what she needed to pay her rent, so she wound up \u201cin rent court year after year, month after month.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMs. Cornick said she supported her 24-year-old granddaughter but could not qualify for social services because, she has repeatedly been told, she made too much money. \u201cThis is an abomination,\u201d she said.\n\nTwo professors of economics testified that one of the benefits of a higher minimum wage would be to reduce the dependence of fast-food workers on subsidies from the government.\n\nStephanie Luce, a professor of labor studies at the City University of New York, said higher wages cut down on employee turnover and spur higher productivity. She said some large companies in the fast-food industry had the power to set wages for the industry. \u201cThey set them low not because they have to, but because they can,\u201d she said.\n\nIn the first three hours of the hearing, one man stepped forward to speak against a sharp rise in the minimum wage for food-service workers.\n\nHoward Nielsen, who said he owned two Sticky Lips barbecue restaurants in the Rochester area, said raising the cost of labor significantly would cut into profits and lead to layoffs, and could possibly drive some establishments out of business.\n\nMr. Nielsen said a series of government programs and policies, including the Affordable Care Act, would cost his businesses an additional $400,000 a year. He said it was not feasible for restaurants like his to suddenly pay workers so much more, \u201cunless the American public doesn\u2019t mind spending 40 to 60 percent more\u201d when they eat out.\n\nNick Hanauer, a venture capitalist from Seattle, where the minimum wage has already risen to $11, said that city\u2019s restaurant industry was thriving. He said it had more restaurants per capita than New York or any other city in the country, save one. And that one is not some \u201clow-wage paradise,\u201d he said, but San Francisco, the only city where restaurant workers make a minimum wage of $12.25 an hour.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20150615220641, "twitter": {"description": "Fast-food workers and supporters turned out for a public hearing, before a wage board created by Gov.
