California is violating the Constitution by strong-arming churches into having this coverage in their plans.\u201d\n\nThe abortion mandate policy took effect in August 2014, and ADF filed formal complaints with the federal government on behalf of the churches then. Casey Mattox, senior legal counsel for ADF, told TheBlaze last October that states receiving federal funds, such as California, are prohibited from discriminating against health care plans that do not offer abortion coverage. He warned then that a lawsuit could follow if the federal government did not listen to the churches\u2019 complaints and stop the mandatory abortion coverage.\n\n\u201cBecause Obamacare requires health insurance coverage, and the California mandate requires abortion coverage in any health plan, these churches are truly left with no way to opt out of paying for abortions,\u201d ADF Litigation Staff Counsel Jeremiah Galus said in a statement.\n\nGalus said it\u2019s \u201cabsurd\u201d that the federal government does not require California churches to pay for contraceptive coverage but does require them to pay for elective abortion coverage.\n\n\u201cElective abortions are not part of \u2018basic health care,\u2019\u201d Galus said. \u201cThey have no business being forced into the medical coverage provided by churches that do not wish to support terminating lives due to very real, sincere, and well-known faith convictions. We hope the court will require California to follow the Constitution and respect these churches\u2019 fundamental freedoms.\u201d\n\nCalvary Chapel Chino Hills\u2019 senior pastor, Jack Hibbs, told Live Action News last year that he felt as though his religious liberties as well as the Constitution were \u201cunder attack\u201d and vowed to go to jail rather than provide funding for abortions.\n\n\u201cI felt violated; I felt forced,\u201d Hibbs said of the mandate. \u201cI love America and I love American history, and I have a lot of invested interest in defending the unborn.\u201d\n\nTwo privately-funded, church-based California crisis pregnancy centers have also filed a lawsuit against the state in response to a recent law that requires the centers to provide information regarding abortions to their clients. That lawsuit was filed by conservative legal firm Pacific Justice Institute on behalf of the two clinics \u2014 neither of which refers or provides abortions.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30; polling-uri=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/1.xml; polling-uri2=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/2.xml; polling-uri3=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/3.xml; polling-uri4=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/4.xml", "application-name": "TheBlaze.com", "twitter": {"description": "A group of California churches filed a federal lawsuit Friday against the California Department of Managed Health Care \u2014 the agency that\u00a0mandated churches must pay for elective abortions in their health insurance coverage.
