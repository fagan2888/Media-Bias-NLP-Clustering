Media outlets were immediately flooded with talkingheads aping Obama\u2019s appeal to ignorance.\n\nLeftist sycophant Linda Valdez, writing in the Arizona Republic, declared it\u2019s time to get rid of the Second Amendment because it\u2019s not working. She wailed, \u201cIt\u2019s killing us. It\u2019s turning grade schools and college campuses into slaughter houses.\u201d But her most ignorant assertion was this: \u201cOther rights have reasonable limits that can be discussed and accommodated. The Second Amendment has been turned into the supreme law of the land.\u201d\n\nLiberals condescendingly tell us if we don\u2019t like abortions not to have them, but no such standard applies to gun ownership. They tell us Republicans should stop trying to repeal ObamaCare because is \u201csettled law,\u201d yet they have no such respect for the \u201csettled law\u201d of the Second Amendment \u2014 a natural, God-given right enshrined in the Bill of Rights for more than two centuries.\n\nContrary to the Left\u2019s revisionism, the Second Amendment was not included in the Bill of Rights in order to protect the rights of hunters or sports shooters, or even to protect us from the criminal elements of society. It was enshrined in that sacred document to protect us from a far more dangerous entity: our own government.\n\nGeorge Mason, among the most distinguished of the Founding Fathers, explained the necessity of this protected right as he spoke to the delegates of the Virginia convention for the ratification of the Constitution. He said, \u201c[W]hen the resolution of enslaving America was formed in Great Britain, the British Parliament was advised by an artful man, \u2014 who was governor of Pennsylvania, to disarm the people; that it was the best and most effectual way to enslave them; but that they should not do it openly, but weaken them, and let them sink gradually, by totally disusing and neglecting the militia.\u201d\n\nThose who claim the Second Amendment was intended only for those serving in the militia are right \u2026 sort of. The actual text is as follows: \u201cA well regulated Militia being necessary to the Security of a free State, the right of the PEOPLE to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.\u201d An astute reader would note that the \u201cright\u201d belongs to \u201cthe PEOPLE.\u201d That same astute reader would note that the word \u201cregulated\u201d refers to the militia, not firearms.\n\nAccording to Webster\u2019s original 1828 American Dictionary of the English Language, \u201cregulate\u201d means \u201cto put in good order; as, to regulate the disordered state of a nation or its finances.\u201d In other words, having chosen a militia rather than a permanent standing army for the protection of the nation, it was necessary that the militia be assembled for training on a regular basis; to be, in the language of the Founders, \u201cwell regulated.\u201d It did not mean to restrict.\n\nFurthermore, it should be noted that a militia is not the same as a standing army. In that same speech before the Virginia Ratifying Convention, George Mason stated unequivocally exactly who constituted the militia, answering his own rhetorical question when he proclaimed, \u201cI ask, sir, what is the militia? It is the whole people except for a few public officials.\u201d Get that? We armed and private citizens of the United States constitute the militia.\n\nRichard Lee, another of the Founders, echoed that sentiment, stating, \u201cA militia when properly formed are in fact the people themselves \u2026 and include \u2026 all men capable of bearing arms.\u201d\n\nThe anti-gun crowd claims that times are much different now than when the Second Amendment was written, and it is no longer relevant to our day. Oddly, their view of First Amendment rights is just the opposite. They claim an almost unlimited interpretation of \u201cfree speech,\u201d to include even \u201cexotic dancing\u201d and virtual child pornography \u2014 pretty much anything except political speech, which they say must be tightly restricted.\n\nDo they have a point? Let us look at some of Valdez\u2019s claims.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s killing us,\u201d she laments. \u201cIt\u2019s turning grade schools and college campuses into slaughter houses.\u201d If guns are the problem, then it would stand to reason that those places where guns are most prevalent would be the places where these mass shootings occur. So why is it that, with few exceptions, mass shootings occur in \u201cgun free zones\u201d? Why are there not any mass shootings at gun shows, police stations or gun shops?\n\n\u201c[T]he gun lobby makes sure the mentally unbalanced loners \u2026 will always be able to get the high-power, high-capacity killing machines they need to rip people apart,\u201d Valdez complains. In every mass shooting in memory, the guns used have been semi-automatic rifles and handguns with standard capacity magazines, in common calibers. Ironically, she manages to touch on the real problem (mental illness) while simultaneously dismissing it.\n\nValdez also fails to acknowledge that roughly two-thirds of all gun-related deaths are suicides, and it is ludicrous to believe those would not occur in the absence of guns.\n\nIn the aftermath of the Sandy Hook shootings, Obama directed the CDC to commission a study on the best way to reduce gun violence. The surprising (to the topically uninformed) discovery was that the best way to reduce firearm-related crime is to increase the number of guns in the hands of law-abiding citizens, since citizens possessing privately owned firearms used them to stop crime as much as 10 times more often than criminals used them to commit crimes. It should also be noted that the highest rates of gun-related homicides occur in states and major cities with the most stringent anti-gun laws (i.e., states like Illinois, California and New Jersey, and cities like Detroit, Chicago, Washington and St. Louis).\n\nThe bottom line is this: In the United States, there are approximately 90 million Americans who own roughly 300 million firearms. Each day, 99.99999% of them don\u2019t commit a crime with a firearm. And most of them believe deeply in their God-given right to possess these guns for their own defense. They will not give them up voluntarily, so getting rid of guns in America would mean having agents of the government coming house to house and taking them by force.\n\nThe British tried that here once. It didn\u2019t work out so well for them.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Leftists are getting bolder in their calls for disarming Americans.", "csrf-token": "aXFOAjq3GaoYrYoUaOrqsztn3nVafrxC6hH0SxowbwY=", "msapplication-TileColor": "#2b5797", "csrf-param": "authenticity_token", "og": {"site_name": "The Patriot Post", "description": "Leftists are getting bolder in their calls for disarming Americans.", "title": "Profound Ignorance Behind Calls to Repeal 2nd Amendment", "url": "http://patriotpost.us/articles/38247", "image": "http://assets.patriotpost.us/images/2015-10-14-c98fa736.jpg", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100002378661032, "app_id": 217327155053459}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/mstile-144x144.png", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Leftist sycophant Linda Valdez, writing in the Arizona Republic, declared it\u2019s time to get rid of the Second Amendment because it\u2019s not working.\nOddly, their view of First Amendment rights is just the opposite.\nWhy are there not any mass shootings at gun shows, police stations or gun shops?\nSo why is it that, with few exceptions, mass shootings occur in \u201cgun free zones\u201d?\nThe Second Amendment has been turned into the supreme law of the land.\u201dLiberals condescendingly tell us if we don\u2019t like abortions not to have them, but no such standard applies to gun ownership."}
