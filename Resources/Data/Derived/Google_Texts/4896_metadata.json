(JAMES A. KIMBLE)\n\nJury: Bow roofer swindled customers in Rockingham County.\n\n\n\n\u2014 A New Hampshire roofing contractor was convicted by a jury on Wednesday of bilking about $36,000 from customers around Rockingham County.\n\n\n\nTimothy Currier, 32, of Bow, was found guilty of felony theft by unauthorized taking or transfer and three misdemeanor counts of unfair or deceptive acts or practices.\n\n\n\nCurrier walked out of court free on $10,000 personal recognizance bail, but will face up to 7\u00bd to 15 years in state prison on the felony theft charge at sentencing.\n\n\n\nA jury reached its verdict after two hours of deliberation in Rockingham County Superior Court.\n\n\n\nCurrier had been hired by homeowners in Newton, Danville and Plaistow between September 2011 and May 2012, and used the money to pay for personal expenses instead of hiring labor or buying supplies, according to prosecutors.\n\n\n\nCurrier operated Green Home Energy Systems, LLC until prosecutors with the state Attorney General\u2019s Office Consumer Protection & Antitrust Bureau brought a civil lawsuit and criminal charges against him for allegedly duping customers.\n\n\n\nState prosecutor Quinn Colgan argued during closing statements that Currier was simply a con man who offered steep discounts to entice customers to hand over their money.\n\n\n\n\u201cThis is a story about a con man whose business might have been failing, but saw an opportunity to take money from three helpless victims,\u201d Colgan said during closing arguments.\n\n\n\nCurrier lied about being able to get a discount on roofing supplies, claiming he could bundle their orders with roofing jobs he was doing for churches in Salem or Haverhill, Mass.\n\n\n\nCustomers eventually learned that Currier made up the story about working on a local church.\n\n\n\n\u201cHe gains your trust, your confidence, then he takes your money,\u201d Colgan said. \u201cNo guns, no threats. Just clever lies and half truths. Like a pickpocket with a light touch, you don\u2019t even know you\u2019ve been robbed.\u201d\n\n\n\nDefense lawyer Patrick Carron argued his client was simply a businessman who fell on hard times, and had no intent to steal.\n\n\n\n\u201cYou are the finder of facts in this case,\u201d Carron told jurors. \u201cThey\u2019re going to tell you that you must find him guilty. Use your experiences, your life experiences. Running a business isn\u2019t any small task. It\u2019s harder than it looks.\u201d\n\n\n\nColgan said bank statements showed Currier had taken in $50,000 from customers over the course of a year and had siphoned $28,000 from his business account to pay for his personal expenses. Currier never reimbursed any of his customers, and eventually filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy. The state is now contesting Currier\u2019s bankruptcy claim.\n\n\n\nHe still faces similar charges in Merrimack, Hillsborough and Coos counties.\n\n\n\njkimble@newstote.com\n\n\n\nTo improve the chance of seeing your comment posted here or published in the New Hampshire Union Leader:\n\n\n\nIdentify yourself.
