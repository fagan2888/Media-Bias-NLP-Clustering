The deal involves China pledging to cap its carbon dioxide emissions by 2030 and increasing its use of renewable energy to 20 percent. At the same time, the US would cut its emissions by at least 26 percent from 2005 levels by 2025.\n\nWe spoke with Nathaniel Keohane, vice president for international climate at the Environmental Defense Fund (EDF), a Washington, DC-based nonprofit collaboration of scientists, attorneys, economists and other professionals, to find out what this deal means to the fight for global sustainability and to economic progress.\n\nThe GroundTruth Project: What does it mean to the international community that the US and China \u2013 who together emit 45 percent of the world\u2019s greenhouse gases \u2013 have made this agreement?\n\nNat Keohane: I think it\u2019s a huge deal. It\u2019s a kind of game changer on two fronts. The first is the obvious diplomatic one: Having the two largest economies in the world \u2013 the two largest emitters in the world, who in other issues are sometimes economic rivals \u2013 coming together and cooperating on climate change, and encouraging each other to take steps to reduce their emissions in the long run. I think it\u2019s incredibly powerful.\n\nJust the fact that the US and China are talking about this at the presidential level, making this a key priority, is very important and can help really reshape the dynamic of climate change.\n\nThe second way that hasn\u2019t been focused on as much is the signal this gives to clean energy investors. The world\u2019s two largest economies \u2013 and of course the EU, the third \u2013 are headed towards a clean energy future. They put themselves in that path. And that\u2019s why this matters so much.\n\nGTP: Where does this agreement put the US in the global struggle for sustainability?\n\nNK: I think overall it\u2019s a positive sign that President Obama and his team are making climate change a priority. It\u2019s great to see the president himself set a new target going forward.\n\nThe reality is we will need more. My tweet on this was, \u201cIs this a game changer or is more needed?\u201d The answer is both. It\u2019s a game changer for all the reasons I talked about before; it\u2019s a tremendous and powerful signal from the US; it confirms that the US is helping to lead on climate. And yet more is needed. More is needed on both sides because of the urgency of the climate challenge. So even as we applaud the progress that\u2019s been made, we are going to need to find ways to make even deeper reductions.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Nathaniel Keohane of the Environmental Defense Fund explains what the countries\u2019 pledges mean for the climate fight", "author": "Jessica Mendoza", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Nathaniel Keohane of the Environmental Defense Fund explains what the countries\u2019 pledges mean for the climate fight", "title": "Why the US-China agreement might save the planet", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/11/15/why_the_us_china_agreement_might_save_the_planet_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/11/AP763469438701-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Nathaniel Keohane of the Environmental Defense Fund explains what the countries\u2019 pledges mean for the climate fight", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/11/AP763469438701-1280x960.jpg", "title": "Why the US-China agreement might save the planet", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Why the US-China agreement might save the planet", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, China, Climate Change, Environmental Defense Fund, Global Sustainability, GlobalPost", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde6c8\"", "article_summary": "NK: I think overall it\u2019s a positive sign that President Obama and his team are making climate change a priority.\nThe agreement was announced in Beijing Wednesday at a press conference that closed this year\u2019s Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit.\nThe deal involves China pledging to cap its carbon dioxide emissions by 2030 and increasing its use of renewable energy to 20 percent.\nGTP: Where does this agreement put the US in the global struggle for sustainability?\nAt the same time, the US would cut its emissions by at least 26 percent from 2005 levels by 2025."}
