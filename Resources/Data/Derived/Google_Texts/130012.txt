BOULDER — Qualifying for a bowl game is a 2014 team goal for Colorado. That means a minimum of six victories. But Buffaloes coach Mike MacIntyre said Saturday during the school’s football media day interviews that he doesn’t look at it that way.

Coaches never want to place a limit on their team or have players look past the next practice, never mind the next game.

“We play 12 games, right?” MacIntyre said. “We have to go out each Saturday and take care of business. We want to start out 1-0. And then the next week we want to start out and go 1-0 again.

“We look at each game as a season in itself. We talk about that all the time.”

Fans, of course, are apt to look at CU’s schedule and try to project at least six wins.

“From the outside, our players hear all types of views,” MacIntyre said. “And when I go to speak at a function, I hear people talk about bowls. Of course, we want to go to a bowl. That’s a given.

“But I look at each game as a season in itself. I want to win the first one. And then I want to get ready and win the second one. We don’t want to lose any of them.”

Colorado went 4-8 last fall in MacIntyre’s first season in Boulder. He said he does not hear as much negativity about the program. The ongoing facility upgrades, including an indoor practice facility, have helped immensely, he said.

“I’m excited for what the future holds,” MacIntyre said. “The new facilities have changed the undercurrent of what I would hear when I first got here — that ‘the University of Colorado is not committed to football.’ They cannot say that anymore. Period.

“You can just walk outside (and look at the construction); there is tangible evidence,” he added. “I know it’s changing. This has always been a special place. It’s a beauty town. It’s a great, great school. But we were always being hit about facilities and this and that. Now, that’s not the case.”
