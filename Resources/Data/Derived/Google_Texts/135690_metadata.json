Rifle advanced with a 15-0 victory. ( Timothy Hurst / Loveland Reporter-Herald )\n\nJOHNSTOWN \u2014 There's such a fine line between exhilaration and devastation when November rolls around.\n\nMargin for error is cut to a razor's edge. Win and advance. Lose and nothing's left but heartbreak.\n\nNo. 3 Roosevelt tip-toed that line Saturday at Peterson Field hosting sixth-seeded Rifle, but it was the Rough Riders who tumbled 15-0 and the Bears who lived to fight another day.\n\n\"You know, that's a pretty tough loss. I've had some pretty tough losses in my life, but this one probably,\" RHS coach Noland Eastin's voice trails off, holding back his emotions. \"We've got to find a way to beat these guys. They've had our number and I thought we had it figured out. No excuses. We just didn't get the job done and they did.\"\n\nIt's the third time in four years Rifle snuffed out the light on Roosevelt's season, each time in close fashion. Saturday was a test of wills as the temperature dropped and the snowed swirled, effectively slowing down both squads until the final quarter.\n\nWith both teams yet to light a single bulb on the scoreboard, the Bears began the fourth with good field position at their own 40 and pounded the rock over and over on the ground.\n\nChunk by chunk, Rifle maneuvered its way down deep inside Roosevelt territory and finished the drive with a 12-yard touchdown run by junior running back Ty Leyba.\n\nThe score only put the Bears up 8-0 after a successful two-point conversion with 9:52 remaining in the game, but it might as well have been a 50-point deficit.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Riders (10-2) struggled to gain yards on a consistent basis, frequently putting them in unfavorable down and distances, especially considering the run-heavy offense they utilize.\n\nSnowy conditions didn't do Roosevelt any favors, yet neither did a stout Rifle defense.\n\n\"They came out and they played hard,\" sophomore quarterback Cameron Hurtado said, his eyes still burning with tears. \"We weren't as fired up as they were, that's for sure. It doesn't feel the best. We have a lot of work to do this offseason. It's just tough.\"\n\nRoosevelt was held to 155 yards rushing on 30 carries, well below the 331.2 it averaged over the course of the regular season.\n\nThe Bears \u2014 now surging with confidence \u2014 forced the Riders to give the ball right back and ate up 5:02 on their following possession before senior running back Brock Clark drove home a dagger with a 19-yard touchdown with 3 minutes left in the contest.\n\nIt was a strong finish for Rifle, which opened the game with a long drive before coughing up the football at the Roosevelt 7. The Riders, however, would trade the favor after driving the ball all the way to the Bears' 4 yard line on the ensuing possession and fumbling to give Rifle the ball back.\n\nThe Bears turned the ball over two times in the game, helping keep them out of the end zone, but found success wearing away at a Rider defense that constantly found itself on the field.\n\nRifle (11-1) ran the ball 57 times for 319 yards and two touchdowns, including a pair of 100-yard performances by Clark (22 carries for 132 yards) and sophomore Blaine Vance (25 carries for 160).\n\n\"We needed to get first downs, and (Rifle) got those first downs,\" Eastin said. \"Their offense was obviously more prepared than we were, and I thought they handled the conditions a little better than we did.\n\n\"We put our heart and soul into it for 10 months basically and it's tough to come out here and let it break apart in one day. ... If any team has more character than us, I'd like to see it.\"\n\nCris Tiller: 970-669-5050 ext. 511, tillerc@reporter-herald.com\n\nBears 15, Rough Riders 0\n\nAt Peterson Field\n\nRifle (11-1) 0 0 0 15 \u2014 15\n\nRoosevelt (10-2) 0 0 0 0 \u2014 0\n\nFourth quarter\n\nRifle \u2014 Ty Leyba 12 run, 9:52 (conversion good).\n\nRifle \u2014 Brock Clark 19 run, 3:02 (Eddy Sandoval kick).\n\nINDIVIDUAL STATISTICS\n\nRUSHING \u2014 Rifle: Blaine Vance 25-160, Brock Clark 22-132, Ty Leyba 4-21, Layton Stutsman 5-3, Brooks Pressler 1-3.
