Tindley Accelerated School, Local Homestead Credit Review commissioner Hobbies: distance running, biking, skiing\n\n\u201cThat loss was putting us on a trajectory where we wouldn\u2019t be in business much longer,\u201d said Sellers, who came on board in 2002, along with a new CEO. \u201cI knew we were stepping into something that required massive changes right away. We spent a lot of time educating leaders that we couldn\u2019t do the same thing we were doing.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe was surprised at the reaction.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhen we brought them in and explained the numbers, every single person stepped up,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are incredibly blessed that everyone understood that we have to figure out how to make what we do work. And people came back with creative ideas.\u201d\n\n\n\nOne obvious, not-so-creative early step was making sure they were collecting the bills.\n\n\n\n\u201cIf we wanted to be a going concern\u2014to serve everybody in the community\u2014we had to collect from those who could pay,\u201d Sellers said. \u201cAnd make sure that we were documenting what we did. It had to be a business that operated within its means.\u201d\n\n\n\nThat required empowering a value assessment team to go department-by-department looking for areas to increase efficiencies. \u201cWe weren\u2019t looking for six-month projects but for quick turnarounds\u2014like spending 50 percent more than we needed to on cups in the patient areas.\u201d\n\n\n\nIt added up to tens of thousands of dollars in small things but, as important, it created a different attitude among all departments.\n\n\n\nOn a larger scale, Sellers discovered problems with billing coding.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhen I first started, it was as high as 50 percent of our bills coming back from insurance companies saying there was something wrong. Our folks hadn\u2019t had the training they needed. Now, when a bill is dropped, it\u2019s accurate.\u201d\n\n\n\nIn the first three years alone, that added up to over $60 million in new collections, not to mention the time savings from not recoding and resending.\n\n\n\nAll of this was before the November 2009 voter referendum that approved building the new Wishard hospital campus, now formally known as the Sidney & Lois Eskenazi Hospital and Eskenazi Health campus.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe went through an enormous amount of thinking on that,\u201d he said. \u201cThe reality is that it would have been so much more expensive and time-consuming to fix the building. But we had to know that the community was ready to support us in building a new hospital.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe admits that entering the world of large-scale construction had a steep learning curve.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe numbers are so big and so staggering it\u2019s hard to keep your arms around it,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I spent a lot of time working with finance people to make sure we knew what was going through those numbers.\u201d\n\n\n\nA large part of Sellers\u2019 job is finding ways to keep people from coming to his hospital.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe need to move out into the community closer to where people live,\u201d he said. His scope includes 10 community health centers, Midtown Community Mental Health, the Richard M. Fairbanks Burn Center and more.\n\n\n\nThe latest addition is an under-construction community health center at 38th Street and Moller Road, which includes not only primary care, but also dental, behavioral health and other services.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe thing I\u2019m most proud of is the ability we\u2019ve had to turn ourselves around to a point where we could build this facility [Eskenazi] for our community, our employees and our patients,\u201d he said. \u201cIt couldn\u2019t have been done if we didn\u2019t focus on our financial requirements. Now it\u2019s about looking to the future and asking, \u2018How are we going to make this system really the best system in our community, to move forward prepared for instability and the unknown, and being able to be a part of the future of health care in Marion County?\u2019\u201d\n\n\n\nThat future involves the Affordable Care Act, which Sellers said, comes at the right time.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat the Affordable Care Act is attempting to do is say that every person will have some insurance product,\u201d he said. \u201cFor a system like ours, where 45 percent are uninsured, to have every one with insurance available makes great sense. Right now, a person comes in as charity care and we have to go through convoluted efforts to fund that. Marian County taxpayers fund it at about $15 million a year through property taxes. But we provide over $150 million in charity care.\n\n\n\n\u201cNow we\u2019ll have a better idea how much money we are bringing in. It may not be the full commercial rate, but it becomes easier to measure. And it will be incumbent upon us to live within those means.\u201d\u2022", "article_metadata": {"description": "Daniel Sellers knew he had to make changes immediately when he joined the Health and Hospital Corporation of Marion County in 2002.", "csrf-token": "F38aM5YxZRe7EbJvWM7i0dU4JvlZukzblaFIvIMqQWM=", "twitter": {"image": "http://www.ibj.com/ext/resources/IBJ-Print2/2013/cfo-2013/mobile/sellers-daniel.jpg?1385584903", "description": "Daniel Sellers knew he had to make changes immediately when he joined the Health and Hospital Corporation of Marion County in 2002.", "card": "summary", "title": "2013 CFO OF THE YEAR: Daniel Sellers"}, "csrf-param": "authenticity_token", "og": {"image": "http://www.ibj.com/ext/resources/aa-stock-images/og-logo.jpg", "type": "Article", "description": "Daniel Sellers knew he had to make changes immediately when he joined the Health and Hospital Corporation of Marion County in 2002.", "title": "2013 CFO OF THE YEAR: Daniel Sellers"}, "keywords": "Wishard Hospital,Health and Hospital Corporation of Marion County,cfo of the year,Eskenazi Health", "google-site-verification": "dEpdCgWEqtwBQ26es3xvj1hiJAdg_f1dGEb3ojELomo", "verify-v1": "g4IS1SbAtb6k021/9HzhkZ2B++kYDaZ8FN48PiruaO8=", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0fba\"", "article_summary": "His scope includes 10 community health centers, Midtown Community Mental Health, the Richard M.
