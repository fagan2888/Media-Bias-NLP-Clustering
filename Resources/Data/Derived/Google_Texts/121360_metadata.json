Some pundits have spun the move as little more than \u201cpolitical posturing\u201d or a toothless act that simply fulfills the campaign promises of a newly elected GOP majority. The truth is that this Senate vote is much bigger than Obamacare supporters would like you to believe. In fact, the Senate vote has literally changed the Obamacare debate forever.\n\nThe Senate bill repealed the employer and individual mandates, repealed the Cadillac and medical device taxes, eliminated exchange subsidies, and removed the federal government\u2019s authority to run the Obamacare exchanges. All good things.\n\nBut what may be the most significant\u2014and least discussed\u2014change is sure to send shockwaves through all 50 state capitals: the U.S. Senate voted to repeal Obamacare\u2019s Medicaid expansion entirely.\n\nTo paraphrase Vice President Joe Biden, \u201cThis is a big freaking deal.\u201d\n\nFor the 20 states that have rejected Obamacare\u2019s Medicaid expansion, the Senate vote brings vindication. Speaker Paul Ryan has been warning states for years that Medicaid expansion funding won\u2019t last. Even President Obama has proposed slashing expansion funding. These states heeded those warnings and, as a result, their fiscal future is more secure.\n\nFor states like Kentucky and New Hampshire that are poised to rollback their expansions entirely, the Senate vote is confirmation they\u2019re on the right track. It\u2019s no longer a question of if expansion funding will be cut but when. The sooner these states can extricate themselves from the Obamacare expansion nightmare, the better.\n\nAnd for the 30 states that fell for the false promise of endless \u201cfree\u201d money from D.C., this vote should be a wakeup call.\n\nMedicaid expansion has been an unmitigated disaster. It has increased government dependency greater and faster than anyone predicted, leaving state taxpayers on the hook for far higher costs than they anticipated.\n\nIn Kentucky, they\u2019ve enrolled more than twice as many able-bodied adults than expansion supporters promised and, as a result, the state expects the program to come in at $1.8 billion over budget for its first two years.\n\nOhio\u2019s expansion was $1.5 billion over budget in the first 18 months. They\u2019ve enrolled 33% more people than the state promised would ever possibly sign up.\n\nAnd in Washington, where they\u2019ve more than doubled their enrollment projection, state officials have been forced to revise their expansion budget five times, to the tune of $2.3 billion.\n\nUnfortunately, these states aren\u2019t outliers. In fact, every single expansion state with available data has exceeded the enrollment and budget promises made by Obamacare supporters.\n\nThese states are scrambling right now to find the money to cover their share of the expansion costs, which are due in the next budget year. (As it turns out, \u201cfree\u201d money doesn\u2019t last forever.) If they keep their expansions, they\u2019ll be forced to choose between cuts to the truly needy in the traditional Medicaid program; cuts to other budget priorities like schools, roads, or public safety; or massive tax increases \u2013 all choices that are incredibly unpopular with voters.\n\nFor these states, and indeed for every state that\u2019s contemplating their Medicaid future, what happened in Washington D.C. last week was far more than a \u201cshow vote.\u201d It was a clear signal that, whether through gradual funding cuts or outright repeal, Medicaid expansion\u2019s days are numbered.\n\nStates should start locating the exits, not rearranging the deck chairs, because regardless of what happens when the bill reaches the White House, the Senate has fundamentally changed the Obamacare debate forever.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Last week, with little fanfare, the U.S. Senate passed a bill to begin dismantling Obamacare.
