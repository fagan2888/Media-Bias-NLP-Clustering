(KEVIN LAMARQUE/REUTERS)\n\nCritics of the health care law, including many business owners, have long bemoaned a provision that requires employers to provide health coverage to their workers.\n\nNow, some of the law\u2019s supporters are starting to call for the rule\u2019s elimination, too.\n\n\u201cRepeal of the employer mandate might, in fact, not be such a bad idea,\u201d Timothy Jost, a law professor at Washington and Lee University and vocal supporter of the Affordable Care Act, wrote this week in a column for Health Affairs.\n\nIn simplest terms, the employer mandate, as it has become known, requires firms with at least 50 workers to offer affordable, comprehensive health insurance to every full-time worker. If they don\u2019t, they face fines of up to $2,000 per employee.\n\nSupporters note that virtually all large employers subject to the requirement already offer health insurance. Nevertheless, opponents have labeled the rule a job killer, warning that companies will hire fewer workers or even let some go in order to stay below 50, while others will pull back on hours to limit the number of full-time workers they must cover.\n\nLast summer, the administration pushed back the mandate for an additional year, until 2015, saying officials needed more time to implement the provision. Seven months later, they pushed the start date back another year for some mid-sized businesses.\n\nDespite the delays, there\u2019s already anecdotal evidence to support the concerns from critics. Some companies, Jost notes, \u201chave reportedly constrained growth to avoid becoming subject to the mandate\u201d while others have started to \u201ccut the hours of part-time employees to below 30 to avoid having to offer them coverage.\u201d\n\nIn light of those consequences, coupled with the logistical problems the mandate is evidently causing for the administration, the voices in favor of dumping the rule are growing louder.\n\nThe Urban Institute, a left-leaning policy research group, recently released a report concluding that nixing the mandate would \u201celiminate labor market distortions in law\u201d and \u201clessen opposition to the law from employers\u201d while only reducing health coverage across the country by a rather tiny 0.07 percent.\n\n\u201cWithout that burden, employers may play more of a role promoting the expansion of coverage under the law,\u201d they wrote \u2014 an important selling point as Democrats in Congress look to quiet opposition to the ACA heading into the mid-term elections.\n\nResearchers are skeptical that the small minority of large employees that do not offer coverage will do so because of the mandate; most will simply pay the penalty. A large share of those firms will be employers of low-wage workers.\n\nJohn Arensmeyer, president of the lobbying group Small Business Majority and another unwavering advocate for the health law, argues that most employers aren\u2019t likely to make hiring and insurance decisions one way or the other based on the mandate. Ultimately, in his view, the rule \u201cisn\u2019t a job killer, but it isn\u2019t a panacea for coverage, either.\u201d\n\nOn whether the mandate should be tossed, he said \u201cthere are good points on both sides.\u201d\n\nIn Jost\u2019s column, he qualifies that the rule should only be thrown overboard if it\u2019s replaced with a more effective, less onerous requirement for employers. An early version of the health care law in the House, for example, would have required firms to instead commit a certain percentage of their total payroll to cover employee health benefits.\n\nImplementation and reporting requirements under that system, Josts argues, \u201cwould be infinitely simpler than those required by the current mandate.\u201d In addition, the revised mandate would bring in roughly the same amount of revenue for the government as the current one, according to estimates by the Congressional Budget Office.\n\nCongress, he advised, should consider the percentage-of-payroll approach \u201cas one that could provide widespread benefits and could garner widespread support.\u201d\n\nStill, tossing out the existing mandate, even if in favor of a new one, faces several political hurdles in Washington. Democrats have shot down anything more than minor tweaks to the law, not wanting to acknowledge the statute needs some major repairs. Republicans, meanwhile, aren\u2019t entirely ready to throw in the towel on a full repeal.\n\nBut with experts on the left and right starting to question the mandate, and with the law still unpopular but seemingly here to stay, some believe it will only be a matter of time before this particular rule is history \u2014 including one former senior White House official.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think the employer mandate will go into effect,\u201d Robert Gibbs, Obama\u2019s former press secretary, said during a speech earlier this spring.\n\nIn fact, he predicted \u201cit will be one of the first things to go.\u201d\n\nFollow J.D.
