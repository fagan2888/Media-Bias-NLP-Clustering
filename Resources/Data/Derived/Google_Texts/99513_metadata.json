The last Democrat to do it was Bill Clinton in 1996.\n\n\"[Former Congresswoman] Gabby Giffords got re-elected twice. [Former Congressman] Ron Barber lost by 167 votes in the worst election in decades for Democrats. So I think so, and I'd like her to try. But first we have to get through the primary.\"\n\nOn Monday, Hillary Clinton will hold her first campaign event in the Grand Canyon State this election cycle, with a rally at Carl Hayden Community High School scheduled for 3:30 p.m.\n\nMeanwhile, Mrs. Clinton's primary opponent, Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, held four events in Arizona last week, including a rally in downtown Phoenix Saturday that drew more than 11,000 supporters -- his largest crowd of any event so far.\n\nArizona's presidential preference election is this Tuesday, March 22, with 85 delegates up for grabs on the Democratic side.\n\nCopyright 2016 KPHO/KTVK (KPHO Broadcasting Corporation).
