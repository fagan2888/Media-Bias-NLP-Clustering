It\u2019s working together as a community, creating the things people want, today. It\u2019s the smile at the end of every transaction and the effort and innovation that customers don\u2019t see. It\u2019s a shop on your street that feels like family, and a store on the other side of the world that you can reach from your phone. It\u2019s a lifetime of opportunities, from first jobs to lasting careers. It\u2019s every person, every product, every exchange, and everything that consumers need. Retail impacts everyone, everywhere, every single day. And when retail thrives, communities across America thrive.
