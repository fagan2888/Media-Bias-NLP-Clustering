Tonight is Jay Leno’s final night hosting long-running NBC institution The Tonight Show, and Leno pulled no punches in his opening monologue, taking multiple shots at NBC amidst the fond look backs and the usual topic jokes. Leno referenced the last time he parted ways with the Tonight Show, saying, “I don’t like good-byes. NBC does, I don’t care for them.” He vaguely acknowledged the Conan O’Brien fracas that ensued by clarifying, “Tonight is our last show for real. I don’t need to be fired three times. I get the hint.”

On a more sentimental note, Leno said he was touched by all the outpouring of good wishes he’s received, even “Anthony Weiner sent me a photo of his penis looking sad.” He reflected on his long career, but worried about his unemployment: “I’m no longer covered at NBC, I’d have to sign up for Obamacare.”

Of course, it wouldn’t be a Jay Leno monologue with the usual topical jokes, and Leno took some parting shots at Justin Bieber, the Sochi Olympics, and, of course, all the politicians Leno’s had fun with over the past 22 years.
