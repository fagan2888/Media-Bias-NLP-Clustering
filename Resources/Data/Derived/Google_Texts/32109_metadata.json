It was about liberal overreach\u2013the stimulus, Obamacare, over-taxation, over-regulation, and we know what the result was. that set off this counterreaction called the Tea Party. And what we\u2019re seeing now six years later is an election that\u2019s not only about ideology. It is a rejection of hyper-liberalism, but there\u2019s now an overlay of sheer incompetence.\n\nIn the second year of this administration, 2010, all of this stuff was aspirational. It was in the future. well, now we\u2019ve seen six years of Obamaism and actually the problem is not just the ideas and the ambitions, it\u2019s the fact they are just incompetent. Remember in 1988, Michael Dukakis said \u2018this election isn\u2019t about ideology, this is about competence. That\u2019s because if you\u2019re a liberal, you don\u2019t want it about ideology. You won\u2019t even use the word.\n\nNow we\u2019ve seen six years of governance. And now we\u2019ve seen this string of incompetence. Everything from Obamacare to the VA scandal to the secret Service/keystone cops routine where they leave the front door to the White House open. and now it\u2019s kind of crystallize crystallized in Ebola with the overpromising, the running around, the contradictions and now we get the appointment of the ebola czar. Has anybody seen the guy? I\u2019ve been saying he\u2019s now in self-quarantine. Everything that they have had.\n\nSo I mean it\u2019s not just that they are the party in government, they are the party of government. it\u2019s not just their values are wrong, their ambitions for government are wrong. They can\u2019t run the damn thing! And that\u2019s why there\u2019s this huge resentment against the Democratic Party and that\u2019s why they\u2019ve got to start calling people names.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.americanthinker.com/blog/2014/11/krauthammer_all_the_dems_have_left_is_race_baiting.html", "image": "http://www.americanthinker.com/assets/images/at-painter-og-image.png", "title": "Blog: Krauthammer: All the Dems have left is race-baiting"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda3eb\"", "article_summary": "And what we\u2019re seeing now six years later is an election that\u2019s not only about ideology.\nwell, now we\u2019ve seen six years of Obamaism and actually the problem is not just the ideas and the ambitions, it\u2019s the fact they are just incompetent.\nAnd now we\u2019ve seen this string of incompetence.\nAnd that\u2019s why there\u2019s this huge resentment against the Democratic Party and that\u2019s why they\u2019ve got to start calling people names.\nNow we\u2019ve seen six years of governance."}
