He tells college-aged kids to keep \u201creaching for the stars,\u201d and seniors to focus on positivity.\n\nSign up for and more view example\n\n\u201cYou have to be a person who represents a place of justice and healing,\u201d he tells the several dozen students among the crowd at his town hall at New England College in this quaint New Hampshire town. \u201cChanging the world doesn\u2019t mean becoming president, changing the world means that you do something special for somebody else, living outside of yourself.\u201d\n\nAs the Republican presidential field has devolved into a contest to see who can best display and capture the angst and anger of the GOP electorate, especially as candidates like former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush takes on front-runner Donald Trump, Kasich is trying a radically different course, encouraging the country to \u201ccount its blessings.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re constantly pummeled with all the bad things that go on in our country, but where else would we want to live,\u201d he said at a town hall Wednesday in New London.\n\nKasich says he was called to the new message because of all the negativity he\u2019s seen from voters and his fellow candidates.\n\n\u201cI just get a little tired of everybody running around moping about how terrible everything is,\u201d he tells TIME.\n\n\u201cThere are some real issues, but if you keep hearing about how bad everything is all the time, you start getting negative,\u201d he adds, comparing it to a football coach who only points out his players\u2019 faults. \u201cPretty soon you have a morale problem on the team.\u201d\n\nKasich, who has a reputation as a prickly executive but has effectively masked it on the trail, said he decided to emphasize a more positive message in recent days after realizing the magnitude of the negativity. His tone is more reminiscent of the \u201cjoyful tortoise\u201d campaign Bush set out to run, but has now abandoned as he goes toe-to-toe with Trump.\n\nOn Wednesday morning, Kasich bristled at a reporter who questioned this strategy, turning it into a new stump speech line. Following an event in Hookset at the historic Robie\u2019s Country Store, Kasich was asked by a reporter whether he was \u201cangry enough\u201d to win the presidency.\n\n\u201cIf it takes mean and angry, count me out,\u201d he says later, referencing the question in his subsequent events, \u201cI\u2019m going to remember that for a very long time.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf it takes determination, if it takes a degree of toughness count me in,\u201d he continues. \u201cBut we\u2019ve got too much to be thankful for in this country to be waking up in a bad mood. Don\u2019t let them get you down.\u201d\n\nIt was that problem, he says, that contributed to former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney\u2019s loss in 2012, particularly when the then-GOP nominee campaigned in Ohio, warning of economic collapse when the state\u2019s economy was recovering. \u201cI don\u2019t think that was the right message,\u201d he says, adding it\u2019s \u201cancient history.\u201d\n\nKasich has taken to using his stump speech to encourage a rebuilding of community, telling the story of his childhood neighbor calling his parents to tell them he was sledding into traffic in the street.\n\n\u201cWe need to start sticking our noses into other people\u2019s business and start rebuilding and re-strengthening our communities,\u201d Kasich said in Hookset, a line that drew titters from Democrats and questions from fellow Republican candidates for appearing to support the notion of big government.\n\nKasich, who has come under fire from many Republicans for his decision to expand Medicaid in Ohio under the Affordable Care Act, defended the comments.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a very conservative and Republican line, because if neighbors are helping neighbors, then government doesn\u2019t have to do as much,\u201d Kasich tells TIME. \u201cI think rebuilding communities is a part of rebuilding America.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0", "description": "Ohio Gov.
