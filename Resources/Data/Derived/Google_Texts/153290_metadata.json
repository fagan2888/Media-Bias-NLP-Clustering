A defiant Nugent at first fired misspelled Nazi epithets at CNN, but under tremendous pressure from Republicans who couldn\u2019t quite bring themselves to denounce Nugent (with one exception), he offered what some are calling an apology.\n\nIn most apologies, however, the party who was attacked is the one being apologized to; whereas Nugent specifically said he was not apologizing to President Obama. You can listen to the apology for yourself, but it sounds very much like he\u2019s apologizing for the blowback his remark caused. Asked later in the interview, \u201cAre you apologizing to the President for calling him a subhuman mongrel,\u201d Nugent finally offered a \u201cYes.\u201d\n\nThat still leaves a whole raft of separate ugliness toward the President, but even on the \u201c\u2018untermenschen\u201d score, Nugent isn\u2019t in the clear. Just days before his remarks about President Obama, Nugent appeared on NRA TV to take shots at movie mogul Weinstein\u2019s plan to make an anti-gun film, and the Nazi lingo filled the air like Nugent\u2019s pantload in the waiting room of a draft office:\n\nPlease enable Javascript to watch.\n\nNugent hasn\u2019t apologized for those slurs, or for those he directed at Blitzer and CNN, insincerely or not. Blitzer may be reticent to make himself the story by demanding an apology for himself, but surely, that attack on Harvey Weinstein is as toxic as the one against the President. Hopefully, he will continue to shine a light on the long history of sick statements by Nugent, and the Republicans who can\u2019t quit him.\n\nMy friend Matt Lewis is out with a column today pegging Nugent\u2019s grip on Republicans to a desperation for celebrity attention, and to the fact that liberals hate him. Both of these things are marginally true (although Nugent is endlessly useful to liberals), but that doesn\u2019t explain why people like Ted Cruz, Abbott, Rick Perry, and pretty much every other Republican continue to embrace this literal and figurative shit factory. There are a significant number of conservatives who don\u2019t hold their noses for this kind of thing, they relish it, they believe the President is a subhuman mongrel, and all that that implies.\n\nIf some Republican denounces Nugent, those hateful votes are up for grabs, and there is no corresponding gain. Rand Paul didn\u2019t pick up any conservative votes demanding an apology. Conversely, cutting Nugent slack doesn\u2019t hurt Republicans with decent conservatives like Lewis, because they\u2019ve got ready-made excuses like the President\u2019s \u201cHollywood friends\u201d and their \u201clamestream media\u201d persecution complex. Matt has good advice for Republicans, but is he ditching Abbott over this?\n\nThe only thing that kept this from being another circle-the-wagons last stand for Nugent was Blitzer and his eloquent, authoritative attachment of the rocker\u2019s rhetoric to the Nazis, because while it is SOP for conservatives to dismiss black people as overly-sensitive race hustlers, no one ever says that about the Holocaust.
