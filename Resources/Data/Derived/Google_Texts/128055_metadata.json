More are getting out the plywood to nail over windows and barricades for doors.\n\nDon\u2019t worry, it\u2019s just the new normal under Obamacare, says Lee Hieb, M.D.\n\n\u201cEvents happening now give us some idea of what medicine will be reduced to in the future,\u201d Hieb writes in her forthcoming book, \u201cSurviving the Medical Meltdown: Your Guide to Living Through the Disaster of Obamacare.\u201d\n\n\u201cToday, all over America, small and midsize hospitals as well as hospitals in inner-city, poor areas are closing,\u201d she said.\n\nHieb is an orthopedic surgeon and past president of the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons.\n\nGet the hottest, most important news stories on the Internet \u2013 delivered FREE to your inbox as soon as they break!

Most of the victims are smaller hospitals or those in poor areas, which often serve the greatest number of Medicare and Medicaid patients.\n\nA report at Modern Health Care just a few weeks ago confirmed that among just the critical-access hospitals, which have 25 beds or fewer, there were 14 closures in 10 states in 2013.\n\nAnd the federal bureaucracies that set reimbursement rates for needy patients simply aren\u2019t keeping up with the costs, she said.\n\nHieb writes that \u201cwhereas private insurance might pay the surgeon $4,500 for a spinal surgery (my specialty), Medicare paid less than $1,200.\u201d\n\nIn addition, she says the federal government refuses to pay hospitals for certain services, deeming them \u201cnot medically necessary,\u201d regardless of what doctors and patients say.\n\n\u201cThe result is predictable: economic failure of hospitals and physician practices that have become dependent on government payment for large segments of their population,\u201d Hieb writes. \u201cThe hospitals and offices that will close are those with the least private insurance.\u201d\n\nOne case she cites: Temple Community Hospital of Los Angeles closed its doors Sept. 9. Among the reasons the hospital gave for its closure were \u201clow reimbursement rates\u201d and \u201cregulatory requirements.\u201d\n\nAnd then there was Vidant Pungo Hospital of Belhaven, North Carolina, which shut its doors July 1. It was the only hospital in a small, economically destitute farming town.\n\nThere, Kaiser Health News reported, \u201cThe closing has left local doctors wondering how they will make sure patients get timely care, given the long distances to other hospitals, and residents worrying about what to do in an emergency and where to get lab tests and physical therapy.\u201d\n\nSaid Dr. Charles Boyette, \u201cHalf of them aren\u2019t going anywhere. They\u2019re taking a chance on if they\u2019ll be alive or dead after the emergency passes. The disaster has already started.\u201d\n\nIn November, the company that owns Quincy Medical Center, near Boston, announced the hospital will close by the end of this year. QMC suffers from too much competition \u2013 there are more than a dozen hospitals within a 10-mile radius \u2013 but also from having too many patients with government insurance. Roughly 70 percent of the hospital\u2019s patients are on Medicare or Medicaid.\n\nSome hospitals, rather than closing completely, have dramatically reduced their workforces. In fact, 37 hospitals and health systems cut, or are preparing to cut, at least 100 employees from their payrolls this year.\n\nHospital closures and staff reductions have left fewer facilities and health-care workers to take care of more patients. Consequently, wait times have increased.\n\nThat was the case in West Memphis, Arkansas, after Crittenden Regional Hospital closed Sept. 7. Physicians at local urgent care clinics told the Memphis CBS TV affiliate they were overloaded and had to stay open an extra hour or two every day. Patients had to wait several hours to see a doctor.\n\nHieb warns of that very phenomenon in her book.\n\n\u201cThe hospital in Arizona where I used to work is a 250-bed facility with the latest state-of-the-art cardiac care,\u201d Hieb writes. \u201cIt is a referral center for about 400,000 people. Although you will get great care there, if you go by foot or car to the emergency room with chest pain, you may wait over six hours for an evaluation because the system is overloaded.\u201d\n\nShe previously had warned of the increasing workload for doctors and the negative consequences that can result.\n\nShe told of her own experience with government-run health care, in the form of Medicare. As more and more elderly Medicare patients moved to her city and as the government dropped physician reimbursement levels, doctors began to leave town for cities with more private-pay patients. This put added stress on the doctors who remained, she said.\n\n\u201cIn general medicine and other areas, hospital on-call nights were so brutal \u2013 keeping doctors up all night in spite of working all the next day \u2013 that all the doctors who could function outside the hospital chose to leave the hospital staff for purely outpatient practices,\u201d Hieb wrote. \u201cThose who could afford to retire did so. And in orthopedics, we were left with four surgeons doing the work that was being done elsewhere by 10 or more.\u201d\n\nShe continued: \u201cIn areas where fewer and fewer physicians remain, it is very difficult to recruit new physicians to the job \u2013 since the new docs do not want to be forced to cover impossible patient loads. Around the country, there are already these medical \u2018black holes\u2019 \u2013 areas without coverage for certain specialties.\u201d\n\nJust a week ago, a report from Fierce Healthcare said one of the impacts of hospital closures is that mothers-to-be lack prenatal care.\n\nAnd a report from Becker\u2019s Hospital Review found a total of 20 \u201cclosures and bankruptcies\u201d for 2014.\n\n\u201cNumerous acute-care hospitals and health systems have filed for bankruptcy protection, closed or announced upcoming shutdowns,\u201d the report said, citing the loss of divisions of even major organizations like Indiana University Health and the University of Missouri Health.\n\nAlso, Specialty Hospitals of America sold off two of its facilities in Washington to an investment firm, the report said.\n\nIn another case, the Regional Medical Center in Natchez, Mississippi, filed for bankruptcy for the second time in five years.\n\nHealthcare Dive reported there\u2019s a domino effect following a closure.\n\n\u201cTimes are tough for our nation\u2019s hospitals, and not just the ones forced to close their doors. While employees from hospitals that stayed open believed that inter-hospital communication could mitigate the stress of closures on the healthcare system, when there is too much demand for hospital care, it takes a toll on patients and their families.\u201d\n\nGet \u201cSurviving the Medical Meltdown: Your Guide to Living Throught the Disaster of Obamcare\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Free Press For A Free People Since 1997", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.1", "og": {"site_name": "WND", "description": "By Paul Bremmer Eighteen acute-care hospitals across the United States shut their doors in 2013.
