A West Palm Beach doctor has been forced to temporarily close his doors because he was mistaken for a dead New York surgeon who was convicted of Medicare fraud.

Dr. Andre Celestin said CVS pharmacies and CarePlus, a Humana subsidiary that provides health insurance under the Affordable Care Act, began refusing to fill his patients’ prescriptions about two weeks ago.

Patients were told Celestin’s medical license was suspended even though it’s clear and active.

Officials said Celestin was mistaken for a surgeon in Brooklyn with the same name, whose license was suspended years ago for receiving Medicare kickbacks.

The Brooklyn surgeon died in December 2013.

Celestin is a pediatrician and general practice doctor with a different medical license number. He said not only has the incident damaged his business and reputation, but his patients are not receiving medications.

“I take medication for my heart and diabetes,” patient Eugene Snyder said. “If I don’t take it, I could stroke out or end up in the hospital.”

In a statement to WPBF-TV, a CVS spokesperson said a third-party claims processor apparently confused the names of the prescribers in the system.

The representative said, "(CVS) became aware of the issue (Tuesday), and we have reached out to the processor to resolve this as quickly as possible. We are also contacting Dr. Celestin about this."
