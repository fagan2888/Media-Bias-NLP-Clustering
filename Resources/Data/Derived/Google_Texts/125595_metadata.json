Nothing Trump is proposing in this ban in any way violates anyone\u2019s Constitutional or human rights. This is not true, though, for those in favor of gay marriage or Obama Care.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nIf you want to talk about extreme, let\u2019s talk about extreme\u2026\n\nNo foreigner has a Constitutional, legal, moral or human right to come to America. That doesn\u2019t make it okay to ban all Muslims \u2014 in fact, it is not okay. What is far less okay, though, is the violation of human rights that have come from ObamaCare and the legalizing of same sex marriage.\n\nAlmost all of the same shrill, hypocritical Leftists and DC Media-types screaming \u201creligious freedom!\u201d in opposition to Trump\u2019s immigration ban, are the very same fascists aggressively using the federal government to strip Americans protected by the Constitution of their human rights, specifically the right to honor their religious conscience.\n\nObamaCare outright forces the Faithful to violate their religious conscience; we\u2019re forced to fund birth control and abortion.\n\nOn top of that, most gay marriage supporters want to use the power of the government to force the Faithful to choose between staying in business and violating their religious conscience through participating in a same-sex marriage ceremony, something many faiths (including the Muslim faith) see as the sacramentalization of a sin.\n\nTrump wants to deny foreigners access to America. Compare that to the DC Media cheering every step of the way as the Gaystapo actually put Kim Davis in prison over her refusal to violate her Christian conscience.\n\nTrump is stripping no one of their civil or human rights.\n\nThe fascist backers of gun control, ObamaCare and gay marriage are.\n\nTrump\u2019s Muslim ban bothers me.\n\nThe Left and the DC Media terrify me.\n\nFollow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC", "article_metadata": {"description": "ObamaCare and Gay Marriage Proponents are Far More Extreme Than Donald Trump", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "ObamaCare and Gay Marriage Proponents are Far More Extreme Than Donald Trump", "title": "ObamaCare and Gay Marriage Proponents are Far More Extreme Than Donald Trump - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 1280, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/10/ap_kim-davis_ap-photo7-wi.jpg", "height": 948}, "updated_time": "2015-12-08T08:57:50-07:00", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/12/08/obamacare-and-gay-marriage-proponents-are-far-more-extreme-than-donald-trump/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "ObamaCare and Gay Marriage Proponents are Far More Extreme Than Donald Trump", "creator": "@noltenc", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/10/ap_kim-davis_ap-photo7-wi.jpg", "title": "ObamaCare and Gay Marriage Proponents are Far More Extreme Than Donald Trump - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Donald Trump 2016, gay rights gay marriage, Muslim immigration,2016 Presidential Race, Big Government,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "published_time": "2015-12-08T08:53:33-07:00", "section": "2016 Presidential Race", "modified_time": "2015-12-08T08:57:50-07:00", "tag": "Muslim immigration", "categories": "Big Government,2016 Presidential Race"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd42aa\"", "article_summary": "This is not true, though, for those in favor of gay marriage or Obama Care.\nThe fascist backers of gun control, ObamaCare and gay marriage are.\nWhat is far less okay, though, is the violation of human rights that have come from ObamaCare and the legalizing of same sex marriage.\nNothing Trump is proposing in this ban in any way violates anyone\u2019s Constitutional or human rights.\nTrump is stripping no one of their civil or human rights."}
