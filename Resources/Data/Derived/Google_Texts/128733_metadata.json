Ted Cruz and friendly conservative outside groups looking to exploit unresolvable tensions for fun and profit. The question is: Should Mitch McConnell use the budget reconciliation process to repeal Obamacare? It\u2019s this procedural question that serves as story line to the long-awaited, quixotic sequel to that math-punching blockbuster hit of 2013, Shut Down the Government Until Obamacare Is Repealed.\n\nThe Hill this morning reports on the interest groups that are pressuring McConnell to adopt the tactic. And the fundamental problem with this reconciliation strategy shows itself in the language they\u2019re using to discuss it: the idea that Republicans can \u201crepeal Obamacare\u201d with 51 votes. \u201cRepublicans should use reconciliation to fully repeal ObamaCare,\u201d says Ken Cuccinelli, head of the Senate Conservatives Fund \u2014 no friend to Mitch McConnell. A communications director of the mighty Heritage Action echoes Cuccinelli, arguing, \u201c\u2018the most important\u2019 thing that Republicans could do in the majority would be to \u2018use the reconciliation instructions to repeal ObamaCare.'\u201d\n\nDo you see the problem with this language? Mitch McConnell and Senate Republicans cannot, as it happens, repeal Obamacare with 51 votes. What they can do is pass a bill to repeal Obamacare with 51 votes. The House, as it does every 45 minutes or so, can also pass a bill to repeal Obamacare. Once each chamber has passed a bill to repeal Obamacare, that bill can go to President Obama. And then he will veto it. The numbers do not exist in either the House or the Senate to override that veto.\n\nThis is a tedious semantic distinction, but it\u2019s the precise tedious semantic distinction that\u2019s keeping this mathless, waste-of-time strategy alive and gaining momentum well past its sell date. It\u2019s much more fun and fruitful for the Senate Conservatives Fund or Heritage to write one of those \u201cDear Conservatives\u201d emails calling on Senate Republicans to \u201crepeal Obamacare\u201d than it is to write one calling on Senate Republicans to \u201cpass a repeal of Obamacare.\u201d As though it\u2019s up to Mitch McConnell\u2019s predilection for aggressive procedural maneuvering to determine whether the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act remains the law of the land. But the only thing that\u2019s within Mitch McConnell\u2019s control, essentially, is whether to register a protest vote that will get vetoed.\n\nThere is at least one Tea Party outside group, surprisingly, that\u2019s opted for Team Reality in this coming fight. Mark it down now: The Tea Party Express, unlike the Senate Conservatives Fund and Heritage Action, understands that the Constitution gives the president of the United States this power called the \u201cveto.\u201d\n\nSome conservatives question whether the strategy is worth pursuing while there\u2019s a Democrat in the White House. \u201cReconciliation works when you have a Republican president who will go with a Republican Congress. I don\u2019t see a lot of opportunities,\u201d said Sal Russo, founder and chief strategist of the Tea Party Express. \u201cThere are probably some ObamaCare fixes that perhaps would have Democratic support \u2014 the medical device tax [repeal] \u2014 but if it gets too aggressive, it\u2019s not going to stand a chance of getting past the president.\u201d \u201cI think it\u2019s going to be a limited tool,\u201d he added.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Conservative groups are pressuring the new Senate leader to adopt a strategy -- and it has zero chance of working", "title": "Mitch\u2019s first big headache: How to convince conservatives he can\u2019t \u201crepeal Obamacare\u201d", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Conservative groups are pressuring the new Senate leader to adopt a strategy -- and it has zero chance of working", "title": "Mitch\u2019s first big headache: How to convince conservatives he can\u2019t \u201crepeal Obamacare\u201d", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/11/11/mitchs_first_big_headache_how_to_convince_conservatives_he_cant_repeal_obamacare/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/03/mitch_mcconnell5.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Conservative groups are pressuring the new Senate leader to adopt a strategy -- and it has zero chance of working", "title": "Mitch\u2019s first big headache: How to convince conservatives he can\u2019t \u201crepeal Obamacare\u201d", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/03/mitch_mcconnell5.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Jim Newell", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, aca, Congress, Editor's Picks, GOP, Health Care, Mitch McConnell, Obamacare, reconciliation, Senate, Ted Cruz, The Right", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "\u201cRepublicans should use reconciliation to fully repeal ObamaCare,\u201d says Ken Cuccinelli, head of the Senate Conservatives Fund \u2014 no friend to Mitch McConnell.\nThe question is: Should Mitch McConnell use the budget reconciliation process to repeal Obamacare?\nMitch McConnell and Senate Republicans cannot, as it happens, repeal Obamacare with 51 votes.\nThe House, as it does every 45 minutes or so, can also pass a bill to repeal Obamacare.\nOnce each chamber has passed a bill to repeal Obamacare, that bill can go to President Obama."}
