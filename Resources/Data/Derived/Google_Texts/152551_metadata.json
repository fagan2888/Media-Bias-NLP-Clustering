When he took office, more than 25% of U.S. home mortgages were underwater \u2014 meaning that people owed more on their houses than they could get if they tried to sell them. The president offered those homeowners debt relief through banks. Now he\u2019s offering health care through insurance companies.\n\nIn both cases, the administration shied away from direct government aid. Instead, it subsidized private companies to serve the people. To get your government-subsidized mortgage modification, you applied at your bank; to get your government-mandated health coverage, you buy private insurance.\n\nLet a Hundred Middlemen Bloom\n\nIn other countries with national health plans, a variety of independent health care providers \u2014 hospitals, doctors, and clinics, among others \u2014 deliver medical care, while the government doles out the compensation. They let a hundred healthcare providers bloom, but there\u2019s only a single payer. If the U.S. moved to single-payer healthcare, however, what would happen to the private health insurance business?\n\nIn the 1990s, the conservative Heritage Foundation floated the idea of extending health coverage to more Americans via government exchanges or \u201cconnectors\u201d that would funnel individual buyers to competing, for-profit health insurance companies. In other words, let a hundred middlemen bloom.\n\nOn the face of it, such a plan would seem expensive, since it means supporting two bureaucracies, one of which would be obliged to take profits for investors. Meanwhile, doctors would still have the expense of trying to collect from multiple insurers with reasons to stall. But the Heritage plan had one great advantage. Since Harry Truman, American presidents have tried unsuccessfully to get us national health care. The exchange system, however awkward it might be, pacified the insurance companies which had previously spent millions of dollars to defeat other plans for \u201csocialized medicine.\u201d With the support of those companies for a program that not only kept them in the picture, but also promised to deliver millions of new, subsidized customers to them, Obama gave us a national healthcare law.\n\nThe danger is that it essentially makes insurance companies our medical receptionists, a profit-making face that greets sick people whenever they try to use their government healthcare. That gives private companies a lot of power to make the government look bad.\n\nThat\u2019s why it\u2019s important to understand how banks used Obama\u2019s mortgage subsidy program to sabotage debt relief and discredit government. If we grasp how they pulled that off, we may be able to protect the present health plan and someday even get genuine single-payer healthcare out of it. So here\u2019s the story.\n\nThe Home Affordable Modification Program (HAMP) offered banks government incentives \u2014 cash bonuses \u2014 to lower the principal or interest on underwater mortgages. Of course, health insurance companies don\u2019t actually provide healthcare, but banks did provide the underwater mortgages so, however ill-advised or fraudulent they were, those institutions obviously had a role in negotiating their modification. The HAMP partnership was structured so that the government\u2019s role was to provide cash incentives to banks, while participating banks would be required to accept and process the applications of those who were eager to modify their onerous mortgages. Whether they granted a modification was, however, strictly up to them.\n\nIn 2009, when I visited Balthazar (\u201cBalty\u201d) Alatas in Vallejo, California, he had been out of work for a year and had been negotiating a HAMP mortgage modification with Bank of America for nine months. He was beginning to suspect that the bank\u2019s elaborate application procedure was deliberately designed to give people just enough hope to keep paying their old mortgages for as long as humanly possible. He had already emptied his Individual Retirement Account and borrowed all he could, in good conscience, from his in-laws. \u201cBut I may be too cynical,\u201d he said. \u201cSee what you make out of it.\u201d And he set down a pile of printed correspondence about a foot and a half thick in front of me.\n\nThe initial piece of paper I drew randomly from the stack was a request for documents verifying income and expenses. It wasn\u2019t the first time he had gotten such a letter, as he would show me. Like HAMP applicants at other banks, Balty complained of receiving letters asking for the same documents over and over. He\u2019d learned that it was quicker to send things again than to try to locate the person at the bank who\u2019d already received and even discussed the documents with him.\n\n\u201cNo matter how many times they ask, I\u2019ve always complied in full,\u201d he told me.\n\n\u201cI bet you didn\u2019t submit this in full,\u201d I said, indicating a request for utility bills and death certificates.\n\n\u201cWell, there hadn\u2019t been any death in the family,\u201d he responded. He had indeed, however, resubmitted the utility bills.\n\nOne letter I pulled from the pile indicated that his case was being transferred to the \u201cHope Team.\u201d That sounded hopeful to me, but in Balty\u2019s experience each transfer within the bank \u2014 he\u2019d recently been \u201cescalated\u201d to the Escalation Q Unit \u2014 only meant that he had to start all over again with someone new.\n\nAt one point, he complained to a California banking agency about the delays. Bank of America\u2019s response to the state\u2019s inquiry read in part:\n\n\u201cAt times the process can be repetitive and lengthy. Our work-out negotiators work diligently to minimize delays, however, at times unforeseen occurrences beyond anyone\u2019s control may further delay the process. We appreciate your continued patience as we work toward completing the modification of your loan.\u201d\n\n\u201cRepetitive,\u201d \u201clengthy,\u201d full of \u201cunforeseen occurrences beyond anyone\u2019s control\u201d: the bank\u2019s own description sounded remarkably like the morass so many HAMP applicants described to me. Now, I was starting to wonder: Could it possibly be that way on purpose?\n\nNo Modification Granted\n\nIf anyone could cope with paperwork it was Balty Alatas. He\u2019d done a lot of it in his former job and, in some perverse way, he found filling out the forms almost soothing. That was definitely not the case on the next stop in my underwater-mortgage tour of America \u2014 the mostly poor, mostly black city of Richmond, California, where house values had gone down by 66% since 2007.\n\nAlice Epps, a home care attendant, was already behind on her mortgage payments when she heard about what her neighbors called the \u201cObama modifications.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo that\u2019s when I went to all those different government agencies,\u201d she told me. (Actually, some were community groups, but the confusion was easy enough to understand.) \u201cI waited all day in Pittsburg,\u201d she continued, mentioning a nearby city in the San Francisco Bay Area. \u201cAll those people getting money from the federal government saying they are helping people with modifications. They wouldn\u2019t even talk to me \u2014 said I wasn\u2019t eligible.\u201d That was true since HAMP modifications were only available to people who were assessed as having a good likelihood of repaying a new mortgage.\n\nBut along with the do-gooder organizations that told Alice she wasn\u2019t eligible, the inevitable do-badder outfits had sprung up to help people through the HAMP application for a fee.", "article_metadata": {"description": "In 2009, the government trusted big banks to help distressed homeowners weather the financial crisis.
