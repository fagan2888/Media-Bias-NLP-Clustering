When Prime Minister Shinzo Abe visits the U.S. next week, he will be promoting a regional free trade pact and stronger defense ties with America as his government loosens the shackles of Japan\u2019s pacifist constitution.\n\nBut history will be following him.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not just Japan\u2019s arch critics on the issue, South Korean and China, that will be watching what he says. So will Korean-Americans who have championed the cause of former sex slaves of the imperial Japanese military, and the dwindling ranks of elderly U.S. veterans who suffered as prisoners of war.\n\nIn an unusual step, 25 House members have sent a letter to Japan\u2019s ambassador to the U.S., urging Abe to address sensitive issues of history when he becomes the first Japanese leader to address a joint meeting of Congress next Wednesday, a day after meeting President Barack Obama.\n\n\u201cTo ignore past atrocities, Mr. Speaker, is to ensure a very troubling future,\u201d Democratic Rep. Steve Israel said in the House this week.\n\nUnder Abe, Japan\u2019s government has given an impression of apology fatigue.\n\nSince the 1990s, Japanese governments have apologized directly for wartime aggression and treatment of so-called comfort women \u2014 tens of thousands of women across Asia, many of them Koreans, who were forced to provide sex to Japan\u2019s front-line soldiers.\n\nAbe says his government upholds those apologies, and he has spoken of his \u201cheartfelt sympathy\u201d for the comfort women. But he appears reluctant to repeat another apology himself, despite the complications that has caused in Tokyo\u2019s attempts to improve relations with Beijing and Seoul.\n\nAbe\u2019s hawkish reputation has made him a target of sometimes shrill criticism in neighboring countries, but he did little to help matters when he visited a controversial Tokyo shrine in December 2013 where war criminals, including wartime prime minister Hideki Tojo, are among those memorialized.\n\nHis speech to Congress will be watched for signs of how he might phrase a formal statement in August marking the war anniversary.\n\nJapanese Ambassador Kenichiro Sasae said Abe\u2019s focus will be on the current and future challenges in the U.S.-Japan relationship, including the pending Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal, and mutual defense guidelines. Abe\u2019s Cabinet has re-interpreted an article of its pacifist constitution and is pushing security legislation that, if approved by Japan\u2019s parliament, would allow Japan in some circumstances to defend U.S. forces if they come under attack.\n\nSasae said he expects Abe will speak about World War II, but added that Congress is not the right place to talk about other countries\u2019 concerns over history. \u201cThis is not something we need to focus on as a major agenda between Washington and Tokyo,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Japan\u2019s war history will shadow PM\u2019s US visit next week", "title": "Japan\u2019s war history will shadow PM\u2019s US visit next week", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Japan\u2019s war history will shadow PM\u2019s US visit next week", "title": "Japan\u2019s war history will shadow PM\u2019s US visit next week", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/04/25/japans_war_history_will_shadow_pms_us_visit_next_week/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/04/us-japan.jpeg4-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Japan\u2019s war history will shadow PM\u2019s US visit next week", "title": "Japan\u2019s war history will shadow PM\u2019s US visit next week", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/04/us-japan.jpeg4-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Matthew Pennington", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3796\"", "article_summary": "Under Abe, Japan\u2019s government has given an impression of apology fatigue.\nSasae said he expects Abe will speak about World War II, but added that Congress is not the right place to talk about other countries\u2019 concerns over history.\nTopics: From the Wires, News, Politics NewsWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Seventy years after the end of World War II, Japan wants to look to the future but can\u2019t shake off its past.\nAnd it\u2019s not just Japan\u2019s arch critics on the issue, South Korean and China, that will be watching what he says.\nHis speech to Congress will be watched for signs of how he might phrase a formal statement in August marking the war anniversary."}
