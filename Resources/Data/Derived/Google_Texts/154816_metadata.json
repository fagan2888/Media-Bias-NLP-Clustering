Yesterday, the Congressional Budget Office reported that the Obamacare will cost the country the equivalent of 2.5 million full-time jobs by 2024, as people choose not to work or work less in order to keep their Obamacare subsidy. Meanwhile, the Brookings Institution announced yesterday that Obamacare stands to shift wealth from the top 80 percent on America\u2019s income ladder to the lowest fifth\u2014a cash grab from most of the bottom half. President Obama and his congressional allies have sacrificed the work ethic and growth on the altar of the Democrats\u2019 upstairs-downstairs coalition, with the emphasis on \u201cdownstairs.\u201d\n\nThat Obama would go gunning for affluent America was no secret. As a candidate, sticking it to the relatively rich was a principle from day one. On the stump, Obama intoned, \u201cI can make a firm pledge. Under my plan no family making less than $250,000 a year will see any form of tax increase. Not your income tax, not your payroll tax, not your capital gains taxes, not any of your taxes.\u201d\n\nWell, it now looks like Obama has played us again, just as he did when he \u201cpromised\u201d that if we liked our healthcare we could keep it. Yes, Obama was sort of, proximately, true to his word when he raised taxes on Americans earning $250,000 and up. But, here\u2019s where Obama as Pinocchio comes in.\n\nThe president hit working and lower middle income America hardest. So while the stock market was setting new highs in 2013, working America was socked with a Social Security tax hike, and has now been told that it will shoulder a larger share of Obamacare\u2019s burden than those closest to the apex of the income pyramid\u2014that is, if they are foolish enough to keep working.\n\nAs an apparently punch-drunk but honest Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) phrased it, \u201cWe live in a country where we should be free agents. People can do what they want.\u201d\n\nRegardless, Obamacare is looking a lot less about Obama and his vaunted calls for \u201cjustice,\u201d and a lot more like Chicago or New Jersey-style vengeance\u2014with a dollop of \u201cwhatever\u201d thrown in for kicks. As it is playing out, Obamacare appears increasingly as if it were designed to punish the Republican rank and file, while haphazardly rewarding the Democrats\u2019 core. And if someone gets hurt that shouldn\u2019t have been, so be it, like those someones who earn between $30,000 and $50,000.\n\nJust look at the 2012 exit polls. Two Novembers ago, Americans earning at least $50,000, and those living in small town, rural or suburban America voted for Mitt Romney, while those below the $50,000 line, or residing in America\u2019s larger cities went for Barack Obama. 2008 told a similar story, with urban America and those under the $50,000 mark full-throatedly backing Obama\u2019s bid for the White House, while the rest of the U.S. was more equivocal and more muted in its enthusiasm.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, the political calculus for punishing the nearly 60 percent of voters with incomes above $50,000 must have stared Obama\u2019s operatives in the face like a bull seeing red. But why tag those who make only between $30,000 and $50,000, and why throw a lead weight around the recovery?\n\nBut we do know why, and it\u2019s called redistribution and it\u2019s about demographics, much as the administration may half-heartedly deny it. Just ask William Daley, the former Obama White House Chief of Staff who helped make Obamacare the reality that it is. In Daley\u2019s own words: \u201cRedistribution is a loaded word that conjures up all sorts of unfairness in people\u2019s minds. \u2026 It\u2019s a word that, in the political world, you just don\u2019t use.\u201d Sometimes the truth can be so inconvenient.\n\nThis brings us to demographics and the Democrat\u2019s upstairs-downstairs coalition. It relies heavily on political contributions from the rich on both coasts; prays for the votes of enough upscale suburbanites; and is electorally wedded to Americans in the lower socio-economic tiers who are disproportionately uninsured.\n\nWhile non-Asian minorities comprise over 30 percent of the population, they are nearly half of the uninsured, according to the Department of Health and Human Services. Although Americans earning below $25,000 annually are approximately a fifth of the U.S., they too are over 30 percent of the uninsured, and how they vote is no secret.\n\nSo the Democrats and President Obama have bet America\u2019s fate and future on an alliance of paupers and princes, with \u201cpity-charity liberalism\u201d as their touchstone. In the words of Michael Lind of the New America Foundation, these \u201ccharity liberals\u201d have \u201cpreferred means-tested programs focused directly on the poor,\u201d disdained \u201cmiddle-class social insurance,\u201d and favored \u201cmicromanagement of the behavior of the poor by upper-middle-class social workers.\u201d As a political agenda, this translates into welfare and Obamacare for the Democratic base, jobs as social workers for the children, or their college roommates, of the Democratic Donor Class, and Social Security\u2014well, we can talk about that later, but by all means let\u2019s think about means testing it.\n\nFrom Lyndon Johnson up until Bill Clinton, the Democrats divorced benefits from work, and managed only to elect the hapless Jimmy Carter to a single term. Then Bill Clinton took on Sister Souljah and welfare, and won the popular vote in five of the last six elections.\n\nRight now it looks like back to the future, with Obamacare as the 21st century\u2019s iteration of welfare, and the Democrats in danger of losing control of the Senate. In the words of Chris Cilizza of the Washington Post, \u201cIf the 2014 election is a referendum on President Obama, Democrats are in deep trouble.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"twitter": {"site": "@thedailybeast", "card": "summary"}, "keywords": "u.s. poli, Barack Obama, Obamacare, Democratic Party", "publicationDate": 201402052120, "wrap": "/content/dailybeast/politics", "description": "Obamacare is looking more and more like it was designed to punish the middle class at the expense of the Democratic base\u2014just like the old welfare days.", "pageNum": 1, "title": "Obamacare Attacks the Middle Class", "tags": "topic:politics,entity:person/barack_obama,Obamacare:Industryterm,entity:organization/democratic_party", "environment": "dev", "platform": "desktop", "template": "article", "type": "house", "parsely-page": "{\"title\":\"Obamacare Attacks the Middle Class\",\"link\":\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/02/05/obamacare-attacks-the-middle-class.html\",\"image_url\":\"http://cdn.thedailybeast.com/content/dailybeast/articles/2014/02/05/obamacare-attacks-the-middle-class/jcr:content/image.crop.410.273.jpg/46387837.cached.jpg\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":\"/content/dailybeast/articles/2014/02/05/obamacare-attacks-the-middle-class\",\"pub_date\":\"2014-02-05T21:20:00+00:00\",\"section\":\"Politics\",\"author\":\"Lloyd Green\",\"tags\":[\"politics\",\"barack_obama\",\"Industryterm\",\"democratic_party\"]}", "news_keywords": "US Politics, Barack Obama, Obamacare, Democratic Party", "sectionTaxanomies": "politics", "fb": {"admins": "1703087,30000737,1117577220,1276800108,931159,514915512", "app_id": 189930913679}, "authors": "Lloyd Green", "article": {"section": "politics", "published_time": "2014-02-05T21:20:00.000Z", "author": "http://www.thedailybeast.com/contributors/lloyd-greenhtml"}, "resourceType": "dailybeast2/components/pages/article", "contentpath": "/content/dailybeast/articles/2014/02/05/obamacare-attacks-the-middle-class", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Beast", "description": "Obamacare is looking more and more like it was designed to punish the middle class at the expense of the Democratic base\u2014just like the old welfare days.", "title": "Obamacare Attacks the Middle Class", "url": "http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/02/05/obamacare-attacks-the-middle-class.html", "image": "http://cdn.thedailybeast.com/content/dailybeast/articles/2014/02/05/obamacare-attacks-the-middle-class/jcr:content/image.img.2000.jpg/1391635126515.cached.jpg", "type": "article"}, "authorIds": "/etc/authors/l/lloyd-green", "content-type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8"}, "article_summary": "In the words of Chris Cilizza of the Washington Post, \u201cIf the 2014 election is a referendum on President Obama, Democrats are in deep trouble.\u201d\nObamacare is looking more and more like it was designed to punish the middle class at the expense of the Democratic base\u2014just like the old welfare days.\nSo the Democrats and President Obama have bet America\u2019s fate and future on an alliance of paupers and princes, with \u201cpity-charity liberalism\u201d as their touchstone.\nJust ask William Daley, the former Obama White House Chief of Staff who helped make Obamacare the reality that it is.\nYesterday, the Congressional Budget Office reported that the Obamacare will cost the country the equivalent of 2.5 million full-time jobs by 2024, as people choose not to work or work less in order to keep their Obamacare subsidy."}
