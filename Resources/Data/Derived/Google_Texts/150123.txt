An overland search and rescue exercise is now being offered in Clarke County for first responders all over the state.

They start out at Archusa Creek Water Park, learning the basics from Newton County Emergency Management Director, John Williams.

"They learn how to shoot an azimuth with a compass, how to get a back azimuth. They learn how to do pace counts and convert that to meter to measure distance. They learn different search patterns and when to use those search patterns," says Williams.

First responders that participated say it's important to know how to navigate, especially in a wooded area.

"When we don't have things such as street signs or reference points, such as stores, we can go to these different areas by following a compass and following waypoints," says Ryan Brown, Lauderdale County Fire Department.

Once the course is completed, the first responders traveled to Clarkco State Park to put their newly aquired skills to the test by working in a real life scenario.

A victim was placed in the woods and first responders were given limited information like hair and eye color, age, clothing description and where the victim was last seen.

"It's important like if you get individuals lost in the woods, hunters, small kids and all," says Benjie Flemming, Clarke Co. EMA.

"If we have a situation where we have a missing person you can't just turn untrained people loose whether in be in the woods, whether in be in a city environment. What it does is create a bigger situation when your first responder gets lost because they don't know what they are doing," says Williams.
