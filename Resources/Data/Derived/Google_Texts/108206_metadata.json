From the LA Times:\n\nLynch, testifying before the House Judiciary Committee, was pressed by Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner (R-Wis.) about whether the president has the authority to transfer \u201csome of the world\u2019s most dangerous terrorists\u201d to the U.S.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe law currently does not allow for that,\u201d Lynch replied. \u201cAnd that is not, as I am aware of, going to be contemplated given the legal proscriptions.\u201d\n\nImmediately after Lynch provided the honest analysis of the situation, she was forced to do damage control.\n\nLater, in response to a question from the Los Angeles Times, Justice Department Director of Public Affairs Melanie Newman issued a clarification of Lynch\u2019s remarks.\n\n\n\n\"The Attorney General is aware that the administration is working diligently to finalize the plan to safely and responsibly close the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, which will be delivered to Congress when complete,\u201d Newman said. \u201cGiven the White House focus on this, her comments were intended to prevent speculation on outcomes of that process.\u201d\n\nThe Pentagon is expected to release a report to Congress and the Obama administration any day detailing the draw down plan for the prison. President Obama has repeatedly threatened to close the prison without congressional approval.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Legality. .05/26/2016 10:42:16AM EST.", "author": "Katie Pavlich", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Legality.", "title": "Attorney General Loretta Lynch: The Law Doesn't Allow Obama to Bring GITMO Prisoners to U.S.", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/katiepavlich/2015/11/18/attorney-general-loretta-lynch-obama-closing-gitmo-would-be-illegal-n2082451", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2015/261/d750bfad-f45c-4984-9f35-54e12a26e291.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "Legality.", "title": "Attorney General Loretta Lynch: The Law Doesn't Allow Obama to Bring GITMO Prisoners to U.S.", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/katiepavlich/2015/11/18/attorney-general-loretta-lynch-obama-closing-gitmo-would-be-illegal-n2082451", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2015/261/d750bfad-f45c-4984-9f35-54e12a26e291.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Attorney General Loretta Lynch: The Law Doesn't Allow Obama to Bring GITMO Prisoners to U.S. , Katie Pavlich, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd252f\"", "article_summary": "President Obama has repeatedly threatened to close the prison without congressional approval.\nBut according to Attorney General Loretta Lynch, who successfully prosecuted a number of terrorism cases during her time as U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of New York, Obama doesn't have the legal ability to transfer detainees to American soil.\nLater, in response to a question from the Los Angeles Times, Justice Department Director of Public Affairs Melanie Newman issued a clarification of Lynch\u2019s remarks.\n\u201cAnd that is not, as I am aware of, going to be contemplated given the legal proscriptions.\u201dImmediately after Lynch provided the honest analysis of the situation, she was forced to do damage control.\n\"The Attorney General is aware that the administration is working diligently to finalize the plan to safely and responsibly close the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, which will be delivered to Congress when complete,\u201d Newman said."}
