That was his only option since his own party's radical left-wing senators didn't want to be seen with him.\n\nObama descended on Minnesota on Thursday where freshman Sen. Al Franken (D-MN) is seeking reelection. Obama won Minnesota by 10 points in 2008 and 8 points in 2012. With one exception, no public opinion survey has shown Franken leading his likely GOP opponent, businessman Mike McFadden, by less than 10 points in over a year.\n\nAnd yet, Franken in taking no chances. On Friday, CNN reported that the comedian-turned-politician is avoiding being caught on camera in proximity with the Democratic President of the United States.\n\nCNN anchor John King reported on Friday that both Sens. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) and Franken cancelled a scheduled appearance with Obama and a flight on Air Force One. He noted that both Senators intend to be in Minnesota, but appear to be going out of their way to avoid Obama.\n\n\u201cIs the president that toxic?\u201d King asked his panel. \u201cAre they that worried about Minnesota that they\u2019re trying to over-manage this?\u201d", "article_metadata": {"rating": "general", "description": "Both Sens.
