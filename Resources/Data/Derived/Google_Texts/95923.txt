Frigid weather and poor road conditions have forced participants in the 28th annual Children’s Colorado Toy Run off their motorcycles and into cars and trucks.

The annual biker run from Aurora Sports Park to the hospital typically draws hundreds of motorcyclists bringing new unwrapped toys to children at the hospital. But this year, organizers asked participants to drive their 4-wheeled vehicles instead.

The first wave of holiday cheer left the sports park around 11 a.m. and is expected to slow travel along East Colfax Avenue as participants make their way to the hospital where they’ll be greeted by Santa and Mrs. Claus, who will travel to Children’s on an antique fire truck.

The event is sponsored by Rocky Mountain Harley Owners Group.
