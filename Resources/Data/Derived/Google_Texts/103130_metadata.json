But you wouldn\u2019t know that by watching the U.S. Senate. Democrats who control the chamber have scheduled a vote for Wednesday on a bill that would effectively reverse the Supreme Court\u2019s Hobby Lobby ruling regarding contraceptive requirements in the Affordable Care Act. And on Tuesday the Judiciary Committee heard testimony on a separate, sweeping measure that would invalidate many state abortion restrictions. Republicans accused Democrats of using the bills as a political wedge in advance of the mid-term elections in November. Democrats did not deny political intentions. The vote Wednesday is on legislation introduced in the wake of the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling that the Religious Freedom Restoration Act can shield \u201cclosely held corporations\u201d with religious objections from having to offer contraceptive coverage.\n\nThe \u201cProtect Women's Health From Corporate Interference Act of 2014\u201d stipulates that any employer that offers group health insurance \u201cshall not deny coverage of a specific health care item or service\u201d that is required by federal law or regulation. The bill specifies (as do the regulations for the Affordable Care Act) that houses of worship are exempt and \u201creligiously affiliated nonprofit organizations with objections to contraceptive coverage\u201d will be provided an accommodation. Related Story The Difficulty of Getting an Abortion in Texas \u201cWomen are tired of being targeted and are looking to Congress to right this wrong by the Supreme Court,\u201d Senator Patty Murray, the bill\u2019s sponsor, said on the Senate floor Monday. But the bill is not expected to get far. The procedural motion Wednesday requires 60 votes, which it is not expected to muster. Also unlikely to get to the president\u2019s desk, at least this year, is the \u201cWomen\u2019s Health Protection Act,\u201d which got a hearing before the Judiciary Committee. \u201cThe reason for this bill is the cascading avalanche of restrictions on reproductive health care around the country,\u201d said Senator Richard Blumenthal, who sponsored the bill and chaired the hearing. \u201cMore than half the states now have these unwarranted and unconstitutional restrictions.\u201d The bill, which was introduced last year, would outlaw most state and local abortion restrictions, including any that \u201csingle out the provision of abortion services for restrictions that are more burdensome than those restrictions imposed on medically comparable procedures,\u201d that do not \u201cadvance women\u2019s health or the safety of abortion services,\u201d and that \u201cmake abortion services more difficult to access.\u201d Those state laws and regulations\u2014more than 200 passed between 2011 and 2013\u2014are \u201cdesigned to accomplish by the pen what could not be accomplished through brute force: the closure of facilities providing essential reproductive health care to the women of this country,\u201d Nancy Northup of the Center for Reproductive Rights testified.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Democrats have introduced bills to undo the Supreme Court&#39;s ruling on religious exemptions for contraception coverage, as well as state laws that single out abortion services, but the legislation isn&#39;t expected to succeed.", "author": "Julie Rovner", "og": {"site_name": "The Atlantic", "description": "Democrats have introduced bills to undo the Supreme Court&#39;s ruling on religious exemptions for contraception coverage, as well as state laws that single out abortion services, but the legislation isn&#39;t expected to succeed.", "title": "The Senate's Pushback on Abortion Restrictions", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2014/07/RTRI614/lead_large.jpg", "url": "http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2014/07/the-senates-pushback-on-abortion-restrictions/374507/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "theatlantic.com", "site": "@theatlantic", "card": "summary"}, "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "p": {"domain_verify": "68e1a0361a557708fefc992f3309ed70"}, "fb": {"admins": "577048155,17301937", "page_id": 29259828486, "app_id": 100770816677686}, "keywords": "The Atlantic, The Atlantic Magazine, TheAtlantic.com, Atlantic, news, opinion, breaking news, analysis, commentary, business, politics, culture, international, science, technology, national and life", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, width=device-width, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe05e4\"", "article_summary": "And on Tuesday the Judiciary Committee heard testimony on a separate, sweeping measure that would invalidate many state abortion restrictions.\nMost of the momentum in fights over birth control and abortion has been in the direction of opponents of late.\n\u201cThe reason for this bill is the cascading avalanche of restrictions on reproductive health care around the country,\u201d said Senator Richard Blumenthal, who sponsored the bill and chaired the hearing.\nAlso unlikely to get to the president\u2019s desk, at least this year, is the \u201cWomen\u2019s Health Protection Act,\u201d which got a hearing before the Judiciary Committee.\nRepublicans accused Democrats of using the bills as a political wedge in advance of the mid-term elections in November."}
