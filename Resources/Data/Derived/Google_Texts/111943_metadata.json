Yet, as the plane flew over Russia, Guan began experiencing acute pains in her abdomen, and thought she was just having a stomach ache. She was moved to the middle of the plane where she sat on the floor, and three doctors tried to determine what was wrong. Then her contractions started getting stronger, and she was moved to first class where she began giving birth.\n\n\u201cI got moved to first class because I could feel something wanting to come out,\u201d Guan told CBC News. \u201cSo, that was probably the moment I knew. I thought I was just gaining a little bit of weight, and then this happened.\u201d\n\nCryptic pregnancies, as they\u2019re clinically named, occur in one out of every 450 women. They\u2019re often unknown until the 20th week of pregnancy or later. The couple was completely surprised, as only a month ago Guan had taken a pregnancy test \u2014 the results came back negative. It\u2019s possible this happened because the test couldn\u2019t pick up human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), a hormone that pregnancy tests look for, and one that also alerts the mother physiologically and psychologically that a baby is on the way.\n\nDespite the sudden birth, the couple is ecstatic to welcome their daughter Chloe to the world.
