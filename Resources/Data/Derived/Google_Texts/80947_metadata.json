Nelson, the plant\u2019s safety coordinator. \u201cThis is not easy work, and you will never know that unless you experience it. It\u2019s tough on your body,\u201d\n\nThat money gets poured back into the economy, with Mount Holly accounting for a nearly $1 billion annual impact on the Charleston region, according to the USC study.\n\nAnxiousness\n\nMany of Century Aluminum\u2019s workers say they realize how lucky they are to have such jobs.\n\n\u201cMy kids are 6 and 7 years old,\u201d Nelson said. \u201cMy wife hasn\u2019t had to work since we got married and this job provides a good living for us. Things will change a lot for my kids if this place closes. With my wife probably having to go to work and me having to find another job, we\u2019d have to put them in day care. And there\u2019s a big difference between them being with mom and being with someone else.\u201d\n\nStephen Howard, a process control technician, worries about the time he\u2019ll lose with his 11-year-old son if Mount Holly shuts down and he has to find a job that doesn\u2019t allow him to work a day shift.\n\n\u201cIf I had to go on a second shift working somewhere, I might only see my son twice a week,\u201d Howard said. \u201cI was with him through Cub Scouts, Boy Scouts, taught him baseball, coached him in football. His dad might not even be involved in his life except to provide for the family if things were to change.\u201d\n\nFamily and work relationships play a key role in Mount Holly employees\u2019 lives, Davidson said.\n\nEmployees not only work together, but they worship together, live in the same neighborhoods, watch after each other\u2019s kids and take care of those who are sick or have fallen on hard times. When a co-worker learned his wife had cancer, for example, Lawrence led a fundraising campaign that paid the medical bills and \u201clet them have a joyful Christmas,\u201d she said.\n\nThe plant\u2019s employees are among the Charleston region\u2019s biggest givers to food banks, Junior Achievement, Ronald McDonald House, Toys for Tots, Miracle League and the Basket Brigade that feeds low-income children. It\u2019s one of a handful of area companies with 60-plus \u201cleadership givers\u201d to Trident United Way, meaning individuals who give at least $1,000 per year to the organization.\n\nLauren Cox, an environmental engineer at Mount Holly, said the Charleston region will miss that charitable giving if Mount Holly goes away. She hopes the smelter remains open so she can eventually show her 1-year-old son the importance of community, as practiced by her co-workers.\n\n\u201cGiving back is really supported here, and I want to show that to my son,\u201d Cox said. \u201cI would hope that I can continue my job and have that opportunity.\u201d\n\nWith the prospect of a plant shutdown just weeks away, Mount Holly\u2019s workers are finding it more difficult to keep their minds on their jobs. Rumors spread quickly, and the unknown future is a frequent topic of conversation.\n\n\u201cI try to always stress to the guys that when you\u2019re on the clock, you do the best job you can do as safe as you can do it. When you\u2019re home, you can worry about power deals and stuff like that,\u201d said Joe Harnage, a casthouse worker since 1980. \u201cBut I can feel their anxiousness. You can see the concern in their faces every day.\u201d\n\nSeeking a lifeline\n\nSome workers, like Nelson, say they don\u2019t understand why Santee Cooper can\u2019t accept Century Aluminum\u2019s proposal to pay the utility about $60 million in transmission fees over the next five years so the smelter can buy cheaper power from out of state. Santee Cooper officials say they can\u2019t accept the deal because it would force other ratepayers to subsidize the smelter.\n\nAmong the utility\u2019s missions, Nelson said, is to be a leader in economic development.\n\n\u201cWhy aren\u2019t they helping?\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re charging us an arm and a leg, and we are struggling to survive. It\u2019s confusing.\u201d\n\nSantee Cooper spokeswoman Mollie Gore said the utility values the jobs and people at Mount Holly and wants to find a solution.\n\n\u201cWe have a lot of employees who live in the same neighborhoods, have children playing on the same sports teams and go to the same churches,\u201d Gore said. \u201cIf there was a way that we could come to terms that satisfy Century and keep our other customers whole, we would do that. We\u2019re still looking.\u201d\n\nSome Mount Holly workers blame Gov. Nikki Haley, saying her administration has turned its back on existing industry to focus on luring new businesses that garner media coverage, such as the Volvo manufacturing plant that will be built in Berkeley County.\n\nLawrence said Haley has gone back on her word.\n\nFollowing a speech at Mount Holly in 2011, the last time electricity prices threatened to shutter the plant, Haley said: \u201cWe are not going to let a government-owned utility company be the reason a company shuts down.\u201d\n\nLast month, however, Haley said she has done everything she can to help Mount Holly stay open.\n\n\u201cShe could do more than what she\u2019s done,\u201d Lawrence said.\n\nNelson said he cheered when he heard Haley make her statement four years ago. \u201cBut now we\u2019re writing these letters telling Gov. Haley we need your help and we get a letter saying I\u2019ve done all I can do. I don\u2019t understand.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe thought we had someone in our corner,\u201d Howard said.\n\nDavidson said his co-workers realize the economics of the aluminum industry are working against them, with cheap \u2014 Century Aluminum officials say illegal \u2014 exports from China depressing prices to pre-recession lows. He said he\u2019s confident the government eventually will crack down on the exports to help save the U.S. aluminum industry. And he points to a deal last week in which New York will give nearly $70 million in power assistance and other funds to Alcoa\u2019s Massena West smelter to keep the facility from closing as something South Carolina officials should consider.\n\n\u201cWe just need a lifeline until they can address the flooding of the market from Chinese metal,\u201d Davidson said. \u201cWe just need that lifeline to get us a future.\u201d\n\nThe first of Mount Holly\u2019s two potlines will be shut down Dec. 14 if no agreement is reached. Layoffs could begin soon after and the smelter would reduce operations through the end of the year.\n\nAs the Dec. 31 deadline nears, Davidson said he draws strength from that honeymoon day decades ago when one door closed and another opened.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of faith,\u201d he said. \u201cGod will provide. He might not provide at the level you are right now, but he will give you what you need.\u201d\n\nReach David Wren at 843-937-5550 or on Twitter at @David_Wren_", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "As possible plant shutdown nears, Mount Holly workers keep faith, hope for best, FP LatestNews, \r\nFP LatestNewsBusiness-Local, \r\nIndustry, \r\nIndustry, aluminum smelter,Berkeley County,Century Aluminum,Goose Creek,Gov.
