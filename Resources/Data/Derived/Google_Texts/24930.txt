Jimmy Fallon is hosting Saturday Night Live this weekend with musical guest Justin Timberlake, and I expect that the winter finale of SNL’s 39th season will feature at least two or three of the season’s best sketches so far, so I thought we’d trot out the best five until now before they are forgotten. It’s been a wildly uneven season of SNL, and it’s hard to say that any one episode has been a wild success (Kerry Washington’s turn as host was likely the best of the season), but the high points have been incredibly high, displaying the potential that she has once it moves past its rebuilding season. Even the worst episodes (Ed Norton, John Goodman) have featured something that made the episode worthwhile (at least for those who only watch highlights the next morning).

There is clearly a lot of talent on the show, with Kate McKinnon and Taran Killam already on the verge of breaking out (and Cecily Strong isn’ far behind). The biggest complaint about this season — besides the lack of a black female cast member, or the fact that we still can’t name most of the new cast members — is that it’s over-relied on the two most veteran cast members, Kenan Thompson and Bobby Moynihan. They’ve had some success as bit players on the show, but neither should be trying to carry SNL, which is what they seem to be doing in some of this season’s episode. As the best 5 videos of the year so far suggest, it’s time to let Taran, Kyle Mooney, and Jay Pharaoh take the lead. (Note, too, that all five are pre-taped, which might also say something about the current cast’s improvisational skills, or lack thereof.
