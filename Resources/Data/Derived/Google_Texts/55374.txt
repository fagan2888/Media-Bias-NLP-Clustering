David, Crispin Porter + Boguksy and Funny or Die all won Grand Clios at the 2015 Clio Awards on Wednesday, for their work on behalf of Burger King, Domino's and the Affordable Care Act—at a ceremony kept lively by emcee Alec Baldwin's comedy and musical performances including Salt-N-Pepa.

"This is horseshit's heyday," Baldwin said of modern advertising in his opening remarks, adding: "It's only a matter of time before marketers begin sending us branded dick pics."

Salt-N-Pepa brought the house down with their performance of "Push It" (made newly popular by a recent Geico commercial). And X Ambassadors—whose song "Jungle" in Beats by Dre's ad "The Game Before the Game" was deemed the best use of music by Clio Music on the night—also played their song "Renegades" on stage.

Melissa Etheridge was on hand as well, as a guest of Clio Music, and sang a snippet of Janis Joplin's "Mercedes Benz"—a nod to a famous early brand mention in rock 'n' roll.

A total of 13 Grand Clios were handed out. See all the winners below.
