UPDATE: Police officers are investigating an early morning shooting and a car accident in southeast Wichita.

SHOOTING DETAILS

Officers responded to a call around 2:30 a.m. in the 7000th block of E. Lincoln -- east of Lincoln and Woodlawn. A restaurant was clearing out for the morning. As a large crowd was leaving, a person opened fire and a bullet hit a person.

The victim suffered minor injuries. The size of the crowd made it difficult for officers.

“Just with all the amount of people that were over here. There was an excess of probably 200 people that were over here just in this small parking lot, “said Sgt. Kevin Kochenderfer. “When the shots rang out, everyone fled into the neighborhoods and stuff.

Officers spent the morning looking for a suspect in the area. It was challenging, Kochenderfer said, because they were trying to figure out who was a victim, suspect or bystander.

No arrests have been made.

HEAD-ON CRASH

In the same area, first-responders are also working the scene of a head-on collision. Kochenderfer said the driver appeared to have been distracted by the commotion from the shooting and they ran into a vehicle. Nobody was seriously hurt.
