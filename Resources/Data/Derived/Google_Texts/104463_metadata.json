However, crucial questions about the constitutionality of EPA\u2019s grand scheme risk getting lost in the mix.\n\nThese questions should remain front and center. Surrender to the growing federal technocracy out of a pragmatic necessity is what nourishes the administrative state at the expense of fundamental democratic principles. Regrettably, many states and industries apparently intend to submit compliance plans in hopes of making the best of it.\n\nThe EPA\u2019s expansive Clean Power Plan recalls Justice Antonin Scalia\u2019s rebuke to another EPA overreach in an earlier, more light-handed carbon rule:\n\n\u201cWhen an agency claims to discover in a long-extant statute an unheralded power to regulate a significant portion of the American economy, we typically greet its announcement with a measure of skepticism. We expect Congress to speak clearly if it wishes to assign to an agency decisions of vast economic and political significance.\u201d\n\nIf that earlier rule requiring relatively modest energy efficiency measures for large industries merits Justice Scalia\u2019s sweeping rebuke, the EPA\u2019s final rule to re-engineer the electric power sector takes regulatory purview to uncharted territory. Adoption of the Clean Power Plan rule is a milestone in federal regulation.\n\nIf the Affordable Care Act federalizes medical care and Dodd-Frank federalizes the banking system, the EPA\u2019s Clean Power Plan federalizes the electric sector, but with a glaring distinction. Congress has considered, but always rejected, any new laws authorizing the EPA\u2019s regulation of carbon dioxide.\n\nOperating like the central nervous system of the economy and each home, the power sector affects every other sector. Over the last century, the United States has developed a highly intricate electric system that reliably generates abundant and affordable power. The EPA now has arrogated the authority to redesign that system under the Clean Power Plan\u2019s ill-suited, tight-fisted interpretation of the Clean Air Act. Under the new rule, carbon content \u2014 rather than cost, safety and supply \u2014 will determine the operation of the electric grid.\n\nAlthough of \u201cvast economic and political significance,\u201d the EPA\u2019s enforceable plan carries no measurable climate benefits \u2014 the raison d\u2019etre of this regulatory action. If the tons of carbon dioxide equivalent to the rule\u2019s mandated 32 percent reduction of emissions are plugged into the science on which the EPA relies, the new rule will only reduce predicted warming by approximately 0.02 degrees Celsius.\n\nWith global warming off the table, the EPA has offered at least four different justifications for the Clean Power Plan: prevention of early deaths; an investment opportunity; \u201cclimate justice for communities of color\u201d; and finally what appears to be the real driver: \u201cleading the world.\u201d The president repeatedly declares that the power plan is a \u201csymbol\u201d providing \u201cleverage\u201d for an international climate agreement. Our president, who also claims that climate change is a greater threat to civilization than radical Islamist terror, is unusually proactive in pursuit of a binding international climate accord later this year.\n\nThe EPA\u2019s plan puts our country on the same green path that Germany and the United Kingdom began several years ago. Those countries created new laws to authorize replacement of their well-functioning electric system with uncontrollable and expensive renewable generation. Their bold efforts, however, have led to \u201cenvironmental lunacy\u201d according to The Economist. Over the past two years, the mainstream media has similarly assessed Europe\u2019s \u201cfalse hope\u201d in renewables as \u201ca fatal blunder with ugly consequences,\u201d \u201ca systematic industrial massacre,\u201d and even a \u201cgreen energy basket case.\u201d\n\nAfter investing billions in taxpayer money, the Germans and the British are left with ballooning subsidies, spiraling electric bills, collapsing energy markets, industrial flight to other countries, and energy poverty \u2014 while subsidizing the return of coal-fired plants and unavoidably rising emissions of carbon dioxide. The clincher: Wood has now become the most widely used source of renewable energy.\n\nThere is no wiggle room for give and take on the EPA\u2019s seizure of the electric power sector. With relatively light judicial restraint, the agency now acts as an independent technocracy without accountability to the three constitutional branches of government. Congress alone can end this inglorious mess by establishing clear limits to the EPA\u2019s authority, which knows no bounds.\n\n\u2022 Kathleen Hartnett White is distinguished senior fellow and director of the Center for Energy and Environment at the Texas Public Policy Foundation and is a former chairman of the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Environmental Protection Agency's now-adopted rule to reduce carbon dioxide from existing electric power plants injects the force of law behind an unprecedented expansion of federal administrative power &mdash; a regulatory power asserted without clear statutory authority.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "The Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s now-adopted rule to reduce carbon dioxide from existing electric power plants injects the force of law behind an unprecedented expansion of federal administrative power \u2014 a regulatory power asserted without clear statutory authority.", "title": "KATHLEEN HARTNETT WHITE: EPA Clean Power Plan breaks regulation authority boundaries", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/aug/10/kathleen-hartnett-white-epa-clean-power-plan-break/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/08/10/8_102015_b4-white-epa-powerg8201.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/08/10/8_102015_b4-white-epa-powerg8201.jpg", "description": "The Environmental Protection Agency's now-adopted rule to reduce carbon dioxide from existing electric power plants injects the force of law behind an unprecedented expansion of federal administrative", "card": "summary", "title": "KATHLEEN HARTNETT WHITE: EPA Clean Power Plan breaks regulation author"}, "Author": "Kathleen Hartnett White", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Environment, Environmental Protection Agency, Clean Power Plan, Congress"}, "article_summary": "Adoption of the Clean Power Plan rule is a milestone in federal regulation.\nThe EPA now has arrogated the authority to redesign that system under the Clean Power Plan\u2019s ill-suited, tight-fisted interpretation of the Clean Air Act.\nDubbed the EPAClean Power Plan, this federal takeover of the electric sector will elicit scores of commentaries about the convoluted mandate.\nThe EPA\u2019s plan puts our country on the same green path that Germany and the United Kingdom began several years ago.\nThere is no wiggle room for give and take on the EPA\u2019s seizure of the electric power sector."}
