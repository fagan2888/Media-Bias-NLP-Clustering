Colorado launched the first taxed and regulated retail sales of recreational pot Wednesday, and while demand was high, the vibe was mellow.\n\nBy 11:40 a.m. Wednesday, Denver city officials in charge of the rollout were crowing. In stark contrast to the average Black Friday sale, the thousands of people who lined up to buy sacks were orderly, peaceful, and respectful of the law.\n\nDavid Downs\n\nLines formed at dawn at 3D Cannabis Center in Denver Wednesday. Snowfall accompanied the 8 a.m. sales launch. \"It's a blessing,\" said one customer.\n\nBoth the mayor of Denver and the city's police chief commended the behavior of customers and store owners, as well as the city staff, which licensed eighteen stores in Denver by the January 1, 2014 deadline.\n\n\u201cI kept telling the staff, \u2018We have to dot every \u2018i\u2019 and cross every \u2019t\u2019! This will not be like the ObamaCare rollout,\u201d said one staff member. \"Thankfully it wasn't.\"\n\nAbout two dozen stores are now open across the state, with the vast majority of them in Denver. Eighth-ounces went for $48 at 3-D Cannabis Center on Brighton Boulevard. That was with the 21.22 percent tax. Supplies of weed held up as well and store owners we talked to seemed confident about their inventory in the coming weeks.\n\nThe most rowdy, pushy contingent of Green Wednesday was the press. The official press conference at 3-D Cannabis at 7:30 a.m. Wednesday was a full-on media circus with shoving and hollering to capture the first legal pot sale in modern American history.\n\nDavid Downs\n\nAt 8 a.m., January 1 in Denver's 3-D Cannabis Center, Iraq War veteran Sean Azzariti purchased the first legal sack of weed in modern American history - an eighth of Bubba Kush to treat PTSD\n\nMany members of the mainstream press joined in and bought sacks themselves. National Cannabis Industry Association Deputy Director Betty Aldworth tweeted:\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to say how I know, but let it suffice to say I'm pleased to know some of CO's journos are enjoying legal #marijuana, too.\u201d\n\nI'm not going to say how I know, but let it suffice to say I'm pleased to know some of CO's journos are enjoying legal #marijuana, too.\n\n\u2014 betty aldworth (@bettyaldworth) January 2, 2014\n\nFor more color, check out some breaking stuff I did here, and some pictures of the day.
