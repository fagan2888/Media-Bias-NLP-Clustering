Terry Branstad is not joining some of his Republican colleagues in asking the U.S. Supreme Court to toss out a key part of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nIowa\u2019s governor joined a 2011 lawsuit that sought to have the court throw out the entire law, also known as Obamacare. But Branstad is not adding his name to the current challenge, which seeks to shut down part of the law.\n\nThe challenge, called King vs. Burwell, asks the court to declare that the Affordable Care Act doesn\u2019t allow people to obtain public subsidies for health insurance purchased on the federal online marketplace, called healthcare.gov. The lawsuit contends that such subsidies are only allowed for insurance purchased on state-run systems.\n\nMost states, including Iowa, decided not to set up their own marketplaces, and are instead relying on the federal system. About 30,000 moderate-income Iowans obtained subsidized health insurance that way last year. If the Burwell challenge succeeds, those people could lose their subsidies, which often amount to hundreds of dollars per month.\n\nBranstad spokesman Jimmy Centers said Monday that the governor has not fully reviewed the current lawsuit\u2019s arguments, which the Supreme Court is expected to hear in March. \u201cThough Gov. Branstad has not joined in this particular lawsuit, he continues to believe Obamacare is unaffordable, unsustainable and creates too much uncertainty for Iowans. The implementation of this law has been flawed from the very beginning,\u201d Centers wrote in an email to the Register.\n\nCenters alluded to Branstad\u2019s 2013 choice to accept a modified version of Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act. Under that plan, some poor Iowans are receiving private coverage with federal money paying the premiums. Many others are receiving public insurance, similar to Medicaid but with some conditions, including that they participate in health screenings. Branstad \u201cremains focused on health care reforms that improve care, lower costs and, most of all, empower people to take ownership over their health care outcomes,\u201d Centers wrote.\n\nState Sen. Joe Bolkcom, an Iowa City Democrat who is one of his party\u2019s top leaders on health care issues, said he was \u201cpleasantly surprised\u201d that Branstad has not offered formal support to the current legal challenge.\n\nBolkcom said the governor\u2019s position suggests Branstad understands the value of the subsidized insurance. \u201cIf we\u2019re going to become the healthiest state, it\u2019s pretty important that people have health insurance when they get sick,\u201d Bolkcom said, referring to Branstad\u2019s stated goal of making Iowa the healthiest state in the nation.\n\nFourteen states have their own insurance marketplaces, also known as exchanges. They would not be affected if the Supreme Court agrees with the current legal challenge. Iowa accepted millions of dollars under the 2010 Affordable Care Act to work toward having its own exchange, but Branstad decided in 2012 that it would be better to use the federal government\u2019s system.\n\nA New York Times article Saturday indicated that numerous Republican governors have not formally endorsed the current legal challenge to health-insurance subsidies obtained on the federal marketplace.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://dmreg.co/1BVjXeH", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Governor not lending name to effort that could deny Iowans\u2019 insurance subsidies", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600025120", "og": {"site_name": "Des Moines Register", "description": "Governor not lending name to effort that could deny Iowans\u2019 insurance subsidies", "title": "Branstad doesn\u2019t join anti-Obamacare lawsuit", "url": "http://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/health/2015/01/12/terry-branstad-affordable-care-act-burwell-obamacare/21656319/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/desmoinesregister.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Governor not lending name to effort that could deny Iowans\u2019 insurance subsidies", "creator": "@DMRegister", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/f9ab2c4bf3a92a9374107e24c0d42760644c6e0d/c=0-9-164-173&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/DesMoines/2015/01/12/B9315838930Z.1_20150112170018_000_GND9LJ3T8.1-0.jpg", "title": "Branstad doesn\u2019t join anti-Obamacare lawsuit", "site": "@DMRegister", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "p": {"domain_verify": "372c291dc2b106308d26264f4fba3b10"}, "fb": {"app_id": 169766623060429}, "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Organizations/Supreme Court of the United States", "gci-asset-type": "data", "gci-categories": "Organizations/Supreme Court of the United States", "title": "Branstad doesn\u2019t join anti-Obamacare lawsuit", "author": "Tony Leys", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "news/health", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/ace00ac78281c7d5b5d2d3a71295ba95f6d517ab/c=0-1-164-220/local/-/media/DesMoines/2015/01/12/B9315838930Z.1_20150112170018_000_GND9LJ3T8.1-0.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/abbb8219141ed75787cd668413e5b86a05a049a1/c=0-9-164-173/local/-/media/DesMoines/2015/01/12/B9315838930Z.1_20150112170018_000_GND9LJ3T8.1-0.jpg", "contenttype": "data", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/ac10a809eb0fe7dac32f99870667af78f236bf9e/c=0-18-164-141/local/-/media/DesMoines/2015/01/12/B9315838930Z.1_20150112170018_000_GND9LJ3T8.1-0.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/0fb68517dfbde07056e24693e53601d874d37c08/c=0-39-164-132&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/DesMoines/2015/01/12/B9315838930Z.1_20150112170018_000_GND9LJ3T8.1-0.jpg", "publishtime": "2015-01-12T16:00:49.700000-06:00", "shorthed": "Branstad doesn\u2019t join Obamacare suit", "articleid": 21656319, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/a70fa4fe66edbc989fcaeae7af0af5ba0830beda/c=0-39-164-132/local/-/media/DesMoines/2015/01/12/B9315838930Z.1_20150112170018_000_GND9LJ3T8.1-0.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/70ba65ec1957c59d11d66c93ac28aeef0b06eedd/c=8-0-156-264/local/-/media/DesMoines/2015/01/12/B9315838930Z.1_20150112170018_000_GND9LJ3T8.1-0.jpg"}}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe12ee\"", "article_summary": "Branstad \u201cremains focused on health care reforms that improve care, lower costs and, most of all, empower people to take ownership over their health care outcomes,\u201d Centers wrote.\nBut Branstad is not adding his name to the current challenge, which seeks to shut down part of the law.\nAbout 30,000 moderate-income Iowans obtained subsidized health insurance that way last year.\nBranstad has not joined in this particular lawsuit, he continues to believe Obamacare is unaffordable, unsustainable and creates too much uncertainty for Iowans.\nIowa\u2019s governor joined a 2011 lawsuit that sought to have the court throw out the entire law, also known as Obamacare."}
