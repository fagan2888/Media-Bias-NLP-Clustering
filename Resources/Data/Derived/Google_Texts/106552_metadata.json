PAUL (WCCO) \u2014 A tough new television ad from Republican governor candidate Jeff Johnson is raising eyebrows \u2014 and a few tempers.\n\nThe ad takes some tough shots at Gov. Mark Dayton and, unexpectedly, the owners of the Minnesota Vikings.\n\nIt\u2019s classic political mudslinging, but there is some truth to it, as it counts down the missteps of a Governor who Johnson says is \u201cincompetent\u201d and who the new ad calls \u201cunaware.\u201d\n\n\u201cUnaware of bonuses for his failed Obamacare bureaucrats,\u201d says the ad, as the words \u201cUnaware Mark Dayton\u201d appear on the screen. \u201cNot even knowing what\u2019s in the bills he signed.\u201d\n\nThe ad accurately quotes Dayton saying he was unaware of MNsure bonuses, unaware of a farm equipment tax in a 2013 tax bill and unaware that personal seat licenses were included in the Vikings stadium bill.\n\nBut the ad strays from the truth when it smears Dayton and team owners Mark and Zygi Wilf, linking the Vikings stadium deal and the Wilf\u2019s legal troubles.\n\n\u201cHalf a billion taxpayer dollars to the Wilfs after they committed civil fraud and racketeering,\u201d says the ad, with grainy black and white video of Dayton and Vikings team owner Zygi Wilf.\n\nThat\u2019s at least MISLEADING and borders on false.\n\nApproximately $500 million is the amount taxpayers forked over to build the $1 billion stadium after the Minnesota legislature passed and Dayton signed the bill into law. The Wilfs put up the other $500 million.\n\nThey are appealing an unrelated New Jersey real estate civil fraud and civil racketeering conviction that came after the stadium was approved.\n\nDayton did not award $26,000 in bonuses to MNsure executives: he opposed the bonuses, which were awarded by the MNsure executive director who later resigned under pressure.\n\nAround 140,000 Minnesotans did not \u201close\u201d insurance coverage; the new health care law required insurance companies to offer better policies, sometimes at higher prices.\n\nAnd the \u201clavish\u201d Senate Office Building? Dayton agrees with the ad. He called early designs \u201cun-Minnesotan\u201d. Nevertheless, he signed the bill that allowed construction to begin.\n\nThe Minnesota Vikings strongly objected to the use of their team owners in the Johnson ad.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re extremely disappointed that Jeff Johnson would stoop to this level,\u201d said Vikings Vice President Lester Bagley. \u201cThe ad is reckless. The Wilfs have made substantial contributions to this community and this state. What Jeff Johnson has done is not consistent with Minnesota values.\u201d\n\nA spokesman from Dayton campaign Linden Zakula said, \u201cIt\u2019s not surprising to see a desperate attack from a candidate so far behind. Commissioner Johnson offers no real ideas to improve education, create jobs, or help Minnesota families. It\u2019s easy for Commissioner Johnson to be against everything when he, himself, proposes nothing.\u201d\n\nReality Check Sources\n\nJohnson Ad Video\n\nJohnson Ad Text:\n\n\u201cUnaware of bonuses for his failed Obamacare bureaucrats\n\nNot even knowing what\u2019s in the bills he signed\n\nHalf-a billion taxpayer dollars to the Wilfs after they committed civil fraud and racketeering.\n\n\u2018I was not aware at all\u2019\n\nWhat is Mark Dayton aware of?\n\nMinnesotans deserve an engaged governor who knows what\u2019s going on and what\u2019s in the bills he signs. I\u2019ll be a 24-7 leader who owns his decisions. The buck stops with me.\n\nJeff Johnson for Governor\u201d\n\nDayton Not Aware Of Farm Tax | Personal Seat Licenses | Wilf Legal Troubles When Stadium Passed | Canceled Insurance Policies | MNsure Bonuses\n\nGov.
