A single mother of nine is heartbroken. That's because a cold-hearted thief broke into her home and stole most of her children's Christmas presents. Police say they've seen a rash of these burglaries over the past week.

Nine-year-old Cotton Cosby is sad.

“I spend most of my time in my room making them and the biggest one was a bow and arrow for him, my brother Journey,” said Cotton.

But that bow and arrow and almost everything else under the tree were stolen Monday at this home here near Blanchard.

“You know the last two nights that I’ve gone to bed, I’ve just felt kind of nervous and anxious. Somebody’s been in my bedroom. Somebody’s been in my kids’ rooms and in my house, and it just makes you feel a little bit vulnerable,” said Cheryl Cosby.

Police believe they may have a suspect. Security video from another near-by home shows a man trying to get in the house. He walked off briefly, came back and spotted the camera.

Police say he wore the same kind of military boots that left marks on the Cosby's door. Police are searching for him.

“So, if nothing else we’d like to at least try to get the presents back for the kids. No one deserves that this time of year,” said Detective Dan Guthrie, McClain County Sheriff’s Office.

As for Cotton, he doesn't really have any words for the guy who ripped off his family so close to Christmas.

“Well, I would… I don’t have any words (laughs).”

Police are investigating five similar burglaries over the past week, two of them just Wednesday. If you recognize the person in the video, or if you'd like to make a donation to the Cosby family, call the McClain County Sheriff's Office.
