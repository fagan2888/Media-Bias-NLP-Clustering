Through the first month of the school year, the substitute teacher fill rate is under 80 percent at some buildings and 193 districtwide substitute requests have gone unfilled, Director of Human Resources David Elcock said.\n\n\"As of now, today, we are getting reports from buildings, multiple buildings, of being understaffed with substitute teachers,\" Elcock said.\n\nSuperintendent Russ Mayo said the district's substitute teacher shortage appears slightly worse than last year, when some schools were forced to combine classes or send students to mass study halls in the gymnasium.\n\nThe decision to outsource follows districts such as Easton and Bethlehem that have already made the change. Allentown will use the same provider as Bethlehem, Substitute Teacher Service Inc., which is based in based in Aston, Delaware County, but opened an office in the Lehigh Valley.\n\nSTS maintains a larger teacher pool and actively recruits at career fairs and college campuses, Elcock said. The district will pay the company 31 percent more than it currently pays substitutes, he said.\n\nBy outsourcing, the district doesn't have to worry about limiting substitutes' hours or facing fines for not providing health care to those who average 30 or more hours a week.\n\nIt's not that the district doesn't want to offer health care for those employees, Mayo said, but rather that it has to expend taxpayer money as wisely and efficiently as possible.\n\nDelta-T, another provider of substitute teachers, will be used as a secondary pool in case STS cannot fill all of the district's needs.\n\nIn another decision prompted by Obamacare, the Finance Committee approved a proposal to upgrade the district's time card system.\n\nSecretaries, support staff, paraprofessionals and faculty currently record their hours on paper and submit them through the district's mail system. The district plans to change the system so that all employees use a swipe card to track their hours.\n\nadam.clark@mcall.com\n\n610-820-6168", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Allentown School District likely to outsource substitute teachers", "googlebot": "index", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 The Morning Call", "author": "The Morning Call", "og": {"site_name": "themorningcall.com", "description": "Allentown School District will likely outsource some of its substitute teaching positions, pending a vote at the Oct. 23 school board meeting.", "title": "Allentown School District likely to outsource substitute teachers", "url": "http://www.mcall.com/news/local/allentown/mc-allentown-substitute-teachers-outsourcing-20141012-story.html", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-543b9e05/turbine/mc-allentown-substitute-teachers-outsourcing-20141012", "type": "article"}, "x-servername": "lalvp05.14", "twitter": {"site": "@mcall", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "AAC9C18F70AC386BC4DCF4DDF9BF1786", "robots": "index,follow", "keywords": "Allentown substitute teachers", "fb": {"admins": 1762506491, "page_id": 73291032902, "app_id": 377275452340817}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=501096172, app-argument=http://www.mcall.com/deeplinkid/81661950", "googlebot-news": "index", "date": "2014-10-12", "Description": "Allentown School District is likely to outsource some of its substitute teaching positions, pending a vote at the Oct. 23 school board meeting.", "y_key": "7164478e9f100cbd", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "Allentown substitute teachers"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd30d\"", "article_summary": "Allentown School District will likely outsource some of its substitute teaching positions, pending a vote at the Oct. 23 school board meeting.\n\"As of now, today, we are getting reports from buildings, multiple buildings, of being understaffed with substitute teachers,\" Elcock said.\nThe district currently has a roster of about 300 substitute teachers but only about 200 are actually \"available talent,\" according to the proposal.\nDelta-T, another provider of substitute teachers, will be used as a secondary pool in case STS cannot fill all of the district's needs.\nAllentown will use the same provider as Bethlehem, Substitute Teacher Service Inc., which is based in based in Aston, Delaware County, but opened an office in the Lehigh Valley."}
