The Seattle Seahawks defeated the San Francisco 49ers on Sunday night after lightning delayed the game for an hour. The delay was announced at 9:05 pm EDT and players returned to the field at 9:55 pm.

Lightning flashes and thunder were witnessed in the minutes before the delay of game. Lightning continued for most of the hour, but finally let up around 9:45 pm.

In a game full of interceptions and penalties, the Seahawks managed to rally against the 49ers, winning by a score of 29 to 3. The Boston Globe notes that Marshawn Lynch was by far the star of the game.

Lynch finished the game with a total of 135 yards, including 98 yards rushing. His yards made up for Russell Wilson hitting just two of his first 10 throws. Lynch’s scoring run on the first drive of the second half was instrumental in giving the Seahawks a 12-0 lead.

The Seattle Seahawks defense helped the team keep its advantage over the 49ers. San Francisco quarterback Colin Kaepernick ended the game with three interceptions. He completed 13 of 28 passes. Wilson completed eight of 19 passes and had one interception and one touchdown.

The Seattle Times notes that the win was the perfect end to a night of waiting for Seahawks fans, who endured cold weather and thunderstorms to watch their team compete.

The 49ers will likely be the Seahawks’ toughest competition in the battle for the NFC’s spot in the Super Bowl. But if Sunday’s game is anything to go by, Seattle could come out on top at the end of the season. The Seahawks defense allowed 207 yards and one field goal against the 49ers. The numbers were a drastic change from San Francisco’s game last week against Green Bay. The 49ers gained 494 yards and scored 34 points against the Packers.

The 49ers will get one more chance this season to try to defeat their NFC rivals. The Seattle Seahawks will travel to San Francisco to play at Candlestick Park on December 8.
