He\u2019s the best player from China since Yao Ming. He was the best high school player in a third country \u2014 Texas.\n\nHe could be the best teenage 6-foot-5 point guard living in Denver since Micheal Ray Richardson. The best 6-5 point guard of all time was Oscar Robertson.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s the best young point guard I\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d former Nuggets coach Larry Brown once said.\n\nThe Nuggets must draft Emmanuel Mudiay on Thursday night.\n\nTa-ra-ra Mudiay! He will be a game-changer, a franchise-shaker in the NBA.\n\n\u201cDr. Congo\u201d was on his jersey front last year in China. He has been affectionately referred to as \u201cThere I Am\u201d and \u201cEMS\u201d (Express Mail Service).\n\nHe should be called the Nuggets\u2019 point guard for the next 10 seasons.\n\nOh, but the Nuggets can\u2019t get this 19-year-old basketball prodigy at the No. 7 pick.\n\nWATCH: Who are the true playmakers in the NBA Draft?\n\nNobody believed the Nuggets could get David Thompson, either.\n\nLet\u2019s just see how smart and sharp Stan and Josh Kroenke, Tim Connelly, Mike Malone, Pete D\u2019Alessandro and the cast of thousands in the Nuggets\u2019 front office are.\n\nCan they pull off a Brink\u2019s Robbery by getting an Emmanuel as good as or better than the Emmanuel the Broncos stole last year?\n\nOr will the franchise end up with a swell player who helps them remain a lottery team for years?\n\nSomebody like Justise Winslow, who is advertised as a 6-7 small forward but actually is a smaller forward at 6-4\u00bd. He\u2019s a tweener and a Twitter commotion. The Nuggets already have big small forwards in Danilo Gallinari and Wilson Chandler.\n\nKarl-Anthony Towns and Jahlil Okafor will be drafted 1-2 in the draft, and center Kristaps Porzingis is the latest European du jour. Go big or go home.\n\nWATCH: Woody\u2019s World: Woody\u2019s World: Why Emmanuel Mudiay is a good pick for the Nuggets\n\nBut this man\u2019s league belongs to the point guards.\n\nHello, Steph Curry.\n\nGoodbye, Ty Lawson.\n\nMudiay (pronounced Moo-dee-eh) is a taller, stronger and younger John Wall.\n\nYou didn\u2019t see Mudiay in a college game last year because he was in China, and not many Guangdong Hongyuan Southern Tigers games were televised in America. Like, none. He went to China to take care of his mom (a $1.2 million contract) and because he probably would have been declared academically ineligible as a freshman at Southern Methodist.\n\nHe would have played at SMU for Brown, who knows something about point guards. He was one \u2014 even for the Nuggets, briefly \u2014 and took another former Nuggets point guard, Chauncey Billups, to the NBA title, and yet another, Allen Iverson, to the Finals.\n\nMudiay was born in what was then known as Zaire in 1996, the same year countryman Mutombo was finishing his time with the Nuggets. When Emmanuel was 2, his father died of a heart attack, and his mother supported the children by growing coffee. In 2002, to escape a war-torn land, the Mudiay family received asylum in the U.S. \u2014 and ended up in Texas.\n\nMudiay learned English and basketball.\n\nHe played at a couple of prep academies, earned a national reputation and was offered scholarships by Kentucky and Kansas, but selected SMU because of Brown. But after his high school was shuttered (because of scholastic issues), his future in college was uncertain. Mudiay could become a millionaire if he traveled to the very Far East.\n\nHe averaged 18.0 points, 6.3 assists, 5.0 rebounds and 1.6 steals before spraining an ankle and being forced to sit out much of the season. But the scouts and the digital world had witnessed enough.\n\nMudiay is a big-time player with bursting speed, special peripheral vision, a powerful body with an incredible wingspan and a mature presence on the floor. He is a fierce defender and can hit the 3-pointers, but the midrange jump shot needs improvement.\n\n\u201cWhen all is said and done, I want to become a great player,\u201d Mudiay told Lakers.com. He worked out twice for the Los Angeles Lakers.\n\nOne problem is, the Nuggets have not worked him out once. No problem. Mudiay, not D\u2019Angelo Russell, is the right young man. Perhaps the Nuggets don\u2019t have the moxie or the mettle to secure a deal with the New York Knicks or the Sacramento Kings \u2014 using Lawson, Kenneth Faried and their pick as bait. Maybe, we can hope, he will fall to No. 7.\n\nMudiay can play and pass it off, and the Nuggets can\u2019t pass up this play.\n\nHe would be the Nuggets\u2019 best point guard ever.\n\nWoody Paige: woody@woodypaige.com or twitter.com/woodypaige", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Paige: Nuggets should draft talented point guard Emmanuel Mudiay", "title": "Paige: Nuggets should draft talented point guard Emmanuel Mudiay", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/06/20/paige-nuggets-should-draft-talented-point-guard-emmanuel-mudiay/", "image": {"width": 512, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg", "height": 512}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-06-20T20:08:14+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-05-23T02:28:08+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Woody Paige"}, "article_summary": "He would be the Nuggets\u2019 best point guard ever.\nHe should be called the Nuggets\u2019 point guard for the next 10 seasons.\nHe was one \u2014 even for the Nuggets, briefly \u2014 and took another former Nuggets point guard, Chauncey Billups, to the NBA title, and yet another, Allen Iverson, to the Finals.\nThe Nuggets must draft Emmanuel Mudiay on Thursday night.\nHe could be the best teenage 6-foot-5 point guard living in Denver since Micheal Ray Richardson."}
