I mean, really good health insurance. After all, everything Trump touches turns to great. \u201cThey don\u2019t have to worry about \u2018Obamacare,\u2019 my people,\u201d Trump recently said. \u201cI treat them really good with health care. It\u2019s a very important thing.\u201d\n\nAnd that does appear to be true for some Trump workers. But only if you\u2019re full-time. Part-time employees at the 64-story Trump International Hotel in Las Vegas like Alma Zamarin aren\u2019t eligible for the health plan.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have no healthcare,\u201d says Zamarin, 55, who says she makes $9.71 plus tips delivering room service. \u201cI don\u2019t have no insurance. Because I\u2019m only on call.\u201d\n\nZamarin says she has been on call for nearly six years, passed over for full-time jobs time and again thanks to a manager\u2019s discrimination and favoritism. She says that she desperately needs the insurance to treat injuries sustained in a car accident that left her with a metal rod in her spine and neck. She takes pain medication every day.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear how many workers at the hotel and condominium, where the exterior windows are gilded with 24-carat gold, work part-time. Neither the Trump Organization nor Donald Trump\u2019s campaign responded to repeated requests for comment. But Zamarin and her co-worker Miguel Funes say that multiple other workers in room service are on call.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t want to give the opportunity to everybody to be full-time because that\u2019s going to be money out of their pockets,\u201d says Funes, 38, who like other workers interviewed for this story support the union campaign.\n\nIn December, hotel workers voted to join the powerful Culinary Workers Local 226 and Bartenders Local 165, though management has fought to overturn the results. The Culinary tells Salon that it doesn\u2019t know how many workers are on call because it hasn\u2019t received detailed information from the hotel. But it believes that the number is large.\n\n\u201cA union contract provides for job security, good health benefits, and fair wages,\u201d according to a statement emailed by Culinary spokesperson Bethany Khan. \u201cMr. Trump says he wants to make America great again \u2013 he has a great opportunity to start right here in Las Vegas at his hotel. His employees are eager to start contract negotiations, especially after Trump Toronto employees got a deal signed in one month. If he can negotiate in Canada, surely \u2018The Great Negotiator\u2019 can make a deal in the USA as well.\u201d\n\nThe Trump Hotel\u2019s insurance is pretty good, according to Paul Fronstin, director of the Health Research and Education Program at the Employee Benefit Research Institute. He reviewed a copy of the Trump International Hotel Las Vegas health benefits guide that the union provided to Salon.\n\n\u201cThe premiums are below average,\u201d says Fronstin. \u201cSome might consider this a Cadillac plan.\u201d\n\nThe union, however, says that it has a superior plan\u2014and it includes no monthly premiums. Fronstin, from what he reviewed, agrees.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Employees at a Trump's hotels in Las Vegas open up about the complicated realities of working for the billionaire", "title": "Donald Trump says he treats his employees \u201creally good with health care\u201d \u2014 so we asked them if it was true", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Employees at a Trump's hotels in Las Vegas open up about the complicated realities of working for the billionaire", "title": "Donald Trump says he treats his employees \u201creally good with health care\u201d \u2014 so we asked them if it was true", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2016/03/11/donald_trump_says_he_treats_his_employees_really_good_with_health_care_so_we_asked_them_if_it_was_true/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/12/donald_trump54.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Employees at a Trump's hotels in Las Vegas open up about the complicated realities of working for the billionaire", "title": "Donald Trump says he treats his employees \u201creally good with health care\u201d \u2014 so we asked them if it was true", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/12/donald_trump54.jpg", "creator": "@danieldenvir", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Daniel Denvir", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Donald Trump, Elections 2016, GOP primary, Health Care, Labor, Obamacare, Unions", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Topics: Donald Trump, Elections 2016, GOP primary, Health Care, Labor, Obamacare, Unions, News, Politics NewsBrand icon and Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump boasts that he provides good health insurance to his employees.\nI mean, really good health insurance.\nIt\u2019s a very important thing.\u201dAnd that does appear to be true for some Trump workers.\nPart-time employees at the 64-story Trump International Hotel in Las Vegas like Alma Zamarin aren\u2019t eligible for the health plan.\nHis employees are eager to start contract negotiations, especially after Trump Toronto employees got a deal signed in one month."}
