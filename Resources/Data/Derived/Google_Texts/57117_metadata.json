(Jahi Chikwendiu/The Washington Post)\n\nAmid the coal fields of eastern Kentucky, a small clinic that is part of the Big Sandy Health Care network furnishes daily proof of this state\u2019s full embrace of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nIt was here that Mindy Fleming handed a wad of tissues to Tiffany Coleman when she arrived, sleepless and frantic, with no health insurance and a daughter suffering a 103-degree fever and mysterious pain. \u201cIt will be all right,\u201d Fleming assured her, and it was. An hour later, Coleman had a WellCare card that paid for hospital tests, which found that 4-year-old Alexsis had an unusual bladder problem.\n\nSuch one-by-one life changes are the ground-level stakes ushered in by the election last week of businessman Matt Bevin as Kentucky\u2019s next governor. The second Republican elected to the office in 48 years, he wrapped his campaign around a pledge to dismantle Kynect, the state\u2019s response to the federal health-care law. If he follows through, the Bluegrass State would go from being perhaps the nation\u2019s premier ACA success story to the first to undo the law\u2019s results, razing a state insurance exchange and reversing its considerable expansion of Medicaid.\n\n[Third ACA enrollment begins with new ads and modest expectations]\n\nDuring his first news conference since his unexpected victory, Bevin named abolishing Kynect as a top priority, again contending that the state can\u2019t afford it. He said change would come in \u201ca thoughtful way\u201d and made it clear that he intends for people on Medicaid to pay more for their care \u2014 but left other details of his intentions blurry.\n\nGary Ryan is checked by Fadi Al Akhrass, an infectious disease specialist at the Pikeville Medical Center. Ryan, 64, was a coal miner for 10 years in Pike County, Ky., who moved to Virginia to find work, then moved home for health insurance. (Jahi Chikwendiu/The Washington Post)\n\nStill, the broad contours of his condemnation of the ACA are creating a quandary here in remote Pike County, where 55 percent of voters supported Bevin even though the county benefits greatly from the health-care changes he plans to rescind.\n\nDennis Blackburn has this splintered self-interest. The 56-year-old mechanic hasn\u2019t worked in 18 months, since he lost his job at a tire company that supplies a diminishing number of local coal mines. \u201cThe old guy had to go home,\u201d Blackburn says of his layoff.\n\nHe has a hereditary liver disorder, numbness in his hands and legs, back pain from folding his 6-foot-1-inch frame into 29-inch mine shafts as a young man, plus an abnormal heart rhythm \u2014 the likely vestige of having been struck by lightning 15 years ago in his tin-roofed farmhouse.\n\n[More than half of ACA co-ops now off the market; Michigan plan 2th to fail.]\n\nBlackburn was making small payments on an MRI he\u2019d gotten at Pikeville Medical Center, the only hospital in a 150-mile radius, when he heard about Big Sandy\u2019s Shelby Valley Clinic. There he met Fleming, who helped him sign up for one of the managed-care Medicaid plans available in Kentucky.\n\nOn Election Day, Blackburn voted for Bevin because he is tired of career politicians and thought a businessman would be more apt to create the jobs that Pike County so needs. Yet when it comes to the state\u2019s expansion of health insurance, \u201cit doesn\u2019t look to me as if he understands,\u201d Blackburn said. \u201cWithout this little bit of help these people are giving me, I could probably die. . . . It\u2019s not right to not understand something but want to stamp it out.\u201d\n\nLargest drop in uninsured\n\nKentucky is the only state in the South that wholeheartedly placed in motion all the ideas for spreading access to health care envisioned by the ACA\u2019s authors. During the fall of 2013, when the federal HealthCare.gov enrollment system began as a software mess, Kynect was orderly, signing up people for private health plans and Medicaid.\n\nMindy Fleming sits in her office at the Shelby Valley Clinic, where she is one of the foot soldiers known as \u201cKynectors\u201d trained to enroll people in insurance through the Affordable Care Act. She has signed up more than 1,000 individuals and families. (Jahi Chikwendiu/The Washington Post)\n\nWhen 2014 arrived, President Obama invited Gov. Steve Beshear (D) to sit in the first lady\u2019s box for the State of the Union address and lauded him as \u201ca man possessed when it comes to covering his commonwealth\u2019s families.\u201d\n\nBy the end of that year, census figures show, no other state had as large a one-year decrease in uninsured residents. In a state of 4.4 million people, 500,000 gained coverage because of Kynect \u2014 4 in 5 through Medicaid.\n\nThe effects were particularly dramatic in this Appalachian county, where many coal jobs have vanished and the poverty rate is 23 percent. From 2013 to 2014, the proportion of residents lacking health coverage plummeted by half \u2014 from 13 percent to 6.6 percent.\n\nThe main driver of that achievement: the whopping 7,500 people who joined Medicaid as the state widened eligibility under the health-care law.\n\n[2016 Affordable Care Act insurance rates are climbing]\n\nFleming has single-handedly enrolled more than 1,000 individuals and families. As a \u201cKynector\u201d \u2014 one of the foot soldiers trained to help people sign up for ACA insurance \u2014 she has stood with fliers in front of the local Wal-Mart and at Pikeville\u2019s Hillbilly Days Festival, at churches and food banks, at the county seat\u2019s two small colleges and at drug treatment centers.\n\nMany enrollees are now sending referrals to her, people such as Coleman.\n\nColeman works a couple of days a month as a secretary for Appalachian Title Research off Main Street in Pikeville. She was a media specialist in a nearby school district until budget cuts ended her job and she decided to stay home with her toddler. Not long after, her husband, Jeremy, switched to a truck-driving job with Coca-Cola that paid $17 an hour and offered health insurance.\n\nHis new insurance card had arrived in the mail just before Alexsis got sick. But when Coleman took her to Pikeville Medical Center, she was astounded to learn that the coverage had not begun.\n\nEven now, Kentucky rules allow her to keep WellCare, a Medicaid managed-care plan, as a backup. Coleman is near the end of a high-risk pregnancy that requires her to get frequent shots. WellCare picks up all but a few dollars of the $200 monthly co-pay that her husband\u2019s work insurance requires for the shots. And WellCare helps cover the cost of a pediatric urologist at a Lexington hospital whom Alexsis sees every three months.\n\nVisits to the doctor cost $3, medicine $1 per prescription \u2014 amounts that Coleman can manage even if she can\u2019t always pay the electric bill on time.\n\nWaiting for change\n\nOn Route 23 in Pike County, a billboard for Kynect touts \u201cHappy teeth. Healthy bodies.\u201d If Bevin carries out his intentions, the billboard will be gone. So will Fleming and the other Kynectors.\n\nBeshear, the outgoing governor, created Kynect and broadened Medicaid by executive order. A new governor, however, cannot undo them on his own.\n\n[Clinton proposes cap on out-of-pocket costs for prescription drugs]\n\nUnder federal rules, a state must give a year\u2019s notice before closing a state-run ACA insurance marketplace and switching to the federal one, something no state has attempted. And despite early vows to abolish the Medicaid expansion, Bevin has sounded more nuanced lately. His transition spokeswoman said last week that the expansion would remain intact while he drafts a plan for a different Medicaid permutation and tries to win federal approval.\n\nRepublican Matt Bevin was elected Kentucky's next governor after fiercely campaigning against the state's Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act. (AP)\n\nBig questions loom. Bevin has said repeatedly that Kentucky cannot afford the current expansion, which includes people with incomes up to 138 percent of the federal poverty line. He has not said whether he will try to lower the income threshold \u2014 something federal rules may not allow \u2014 or keep the income ceiling but require people to pay more for care.\n\nEven the latter \u201cwould be a mess,\u201d said Ancil Lewis, chief executive of Big Sandy Health Care, a nonprofit that traces its origins to President Lyndon B. Johnson\u2019s War on Poverty. Before Kynect, 30 percent of Big Sandy\u2019s patients had no help paying their bills. Now, it\u2019s half that many. As Medicaid has taken up the slack, about $2 million more has flowed into the clinics, allowing Big Sandy to hire more nurses, buy new computers and plan to replace an aging clinic.\n\nIf Kentucky charges Medicaid patients a lot more, \u201cit would certainly be a barrier for them seeking care,\u201d Lewis said.\n\n\u201cIt would probably be a life-threatening thing,\u201d said Gary Ryan, 64, who was at Pikeville Medical Center two days after he voted for Bevin\u2019s Democratic opponent. Ryan worked in the mines when he was young, but decent-paying work became so scarce that he took a job in Danville, Va., 270 miles to the east, and spent 13 years as a cookie mixer for Nestle Toll House. He moved back in 2013 to be with his sick wife and because he\u2019d heard that good health insurance was available.\n\nHe sat on an exam table as a doctor, Fadi Al Akhrass, told him he was scheduling a liver biopsy because Ryan still had an active hepatitis C infection. They\u2019d then talk about what treatment he should get.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a plan,\u201d Ryan said.
