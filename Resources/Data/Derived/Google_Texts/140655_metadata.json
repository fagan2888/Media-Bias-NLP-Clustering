We need a leader as president,\u201d Hunter told Politico this morning. Hunter\u2019s endorsement, one of the first for Trump from a sitting representative, makes explicit a point I tried to make yesterday: Policy is utterly irrelevant to Trump\u2019s campaign.\n\nIt\u2019s not that Trump\u2019s supporters don\u2019t have issues they care about; immigration is certainly a priority, as are jobs, health care, and trade. But even the most basic policy details are unimportant to both Trump and his fans. Instead, they are attracted to his attitude and to his rhetoric. As New York GOP Rep. Chris Collins said in his endorsement yesterday, he likes Trump because he has \u201cguts and fortitude.\u201d Trump's supporters view him as strong and capable and direct, and that\u2019s enough.\n\nThat is why I am somewhat skeptical when I see pundits and political analysts argue, as Ross Douthat of The New York Times does today, that, in the aftermath of a Trump nomination, the voters Trump is now winning could be brought over to a more conventional Republican party candidate through the advocacy of a policy agenda.\n\nSo in a post-Trump-as-nominee landscape Republicans will face a pretty clear choice: Either continue to ride the tiger, or try to actually craft an agenda that might appeal pan-ethnically, to middle-class Hispanics and blacks as well as Rust Belt whites. And for all that I make mock of the party\u2019s donors and consultants, at bottom I\u2019m confident they don\u2019t want Trumpism, they don\u2019t want to work for a trending-toward-ethno-nationalism party, they don\u2019t want to go through this agony every four or eight years. So I think there will be some real impetus, in the wake of a Donald-wrought degringolade, to actually try some new things \u2014 things that might not work, yes, but if they did work could actually succeed in bringing a better Republican Party out of the Trumpian wreckage.\n\nDouthat is right, I think, that a Trump victory in the GOP nominating contest could spur panic and innovation in the Republican party, a willingness amongst politicians, donors, and intellectuals alike to experiment, and perhaps even to reexamine some of the party\u2019s most cherished and long-held ideas. And that sort of experimentation and change, born from hitting bottom, could be interesting and perhaps even valuable for a party too stuck in its ways.\n\nThe problem is that there\u2019s precious little evidence that policy-focused experimentation would be successful at winning over the Trump enthusiasts who are currently driving the candidate's primary wins. Yes, it\u2019s true that a Trump victory in the primary would prove that sticking with party dogma on key policy issues isn\u2019t necessary to winning the GOP nomination. But what Trump\u2019s campaign really suggests is not so much that the GOP agenda is wrong but that policy agendas don\u2019t matter much at all.\n\nTrump barely understands the policies he talks about, blatantly lies about the positions he\u2019s held and the policies he has proposed, and he has cynically switched positions enough times on enough issues that anyone who is looking for a particular policy or coherent policy agenda, or even the suggestion of one, would have jumped off the Trump-train a long time ago.\n\nBut as Hunter\u2019s endorsement makes clear, Trump\u2019s supporters are looking for no such thing. They are backing Trump based on generalized dissatisfaction with the political status quo and long-simmering cultural resentments that cannot be easily satisfied with white paper solutions and legislative tweaks.\n\nIndeed, what many of his supporters appear to like about Trump is that he is not running a policy-focused campaign. So the problem with trying to win his voters over with a new and better policy agenda wouldn\u2019t be the specifics of the agenda but with the basic fact that it\u2019s a policy agenda.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "New endorsements from GOP representatives make clear that Trump backers don't care about policy.", "title": "A Different Policy Agenda Won\u2019t Win Over Donald Trump\u2019s Supporters", "url": "http://reason.com/blog/2016/02/24/a-different-policy-agenda-wont-win-over", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14563458171048.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "New endorsements from GOP representatives make clear that Trump backers don't care about policy.", "title": "A Different Policy Agenda Won\u2019t Win Over Donald Trump\u2019s Supporters", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14563458171048.jpg", "creator": "@petersuderman", "site": "@reason", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 17548474116}, "article": {"tag": "HomePage", "published_time": "2016-02-24T20:38:00+00:00", "author": "http://reason.com/people/peter-suderman"}, "msvalidate.01": "212A68A07785B3080038A845C4EE8905", "google-site-verification": "-AmMiilAN-pnjWt369CUWae-VQ-b9wmH4fSGyhbkQxw", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2"}, "article_summary": "So the problem with trying to win his voters over with a new and better policy agenda wouldn\u2019t be the specifics of the agenda but with the basic fact that it\u2019s a policy agenda.\nIt\u2019s not that Trump\u2019s supporters don\u2019t have issues they care about; immigration is certainly a priority, as are jobs, health care, and trade.\nBut as Hunter\u2019s endorsement makes clear, Trump\u2019s supporters are looking for no such thing.\nBut what Trump\u2019s campaign really suggests is not so much that the GOP agenda is wrong but that policy agendas don\u2019t matter much at all.\nIf you want to understand the essence of Donald Trump\u2019s appeal, look to California Republican Duncan Hunter endorsement."}
