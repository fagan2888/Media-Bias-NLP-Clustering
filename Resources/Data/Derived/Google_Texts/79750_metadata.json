Indian Country Today Media Network spoke with her in New York City, where she recently served as guest chair of Latin American studies at New York University\u2019s King Juan Carlos Center.\n\nWhat is your current work in Bolivia?\n\nI used to teach at the Universidad Mayor de San Andr\u00e9s, which is the biggest public university in Bolivia. And I was very much involved in university politics, because I was trying to fight corruption in the university. In 2005, I had a 15-day-long hunger strike, and we managed to kick the dean out. But he left a lot of corruptos were still there, and I was forced to retire.\n\nSince then, I have been doing community things, trying to network and create micro-politics. I am working with artisans, with urban self-reliance groups in La Paz, ecological and feminist groups, working in the qhatu, or traditional peasant fair or market. We try to link every public issue where human rights, indigenous rights, and the rights of the Pachamama [Mother Earth] are involved. We call ourselves Colectivo Ch\u2019ixi\u2014from the Aymara word meaning \u201cstain.\u201d We are mestizos, but we have a strong Indian stain in our souls.\n\nThe current Bolivian situation seems to be one of many contradictions...\n\nI had so much hope at the moment when Evo Morales came into the government. But he has come to crave centralized power. The idea that Bolivia is a weak state and needs to be a strong state\u2014this is such a recurrent idea, and it is becoming the self-suicide of revolution. Because the revolution is what the people do\u2014and what the people do is decentralized. It is a megalomaniacal kind of thing to have a \u201cstrong nation.\u201d It is an inferiority complex. I think we should have many reasons to be very happy with what we are. Instead of always craving to be more modern, more developed, more fucking big\u2014more highways, more technology...\n\nOne can anticipate the response that Bolivia is trying to assert control over its own territory and resources against the United States, and other imperial powers. And it is therefore necessary to form a strong state.\n\nI would say that the strength of Bolivia is not the state but the people. And the people have been strong and stubborn enough to be what they are, and to put their own desires as the terms and conditions of what is going to be the change.\n\nHalf the population of Bolivians live outside Bolivia. There are probably 9 million Bolivians in the diaspora\u2014in Argentina, in Spain, in Italy, Chile, the United States. And it is not the weakness of the state that has thrown people away\u2014it is the strength of the state that has thrown people away! Because they are starting to normalize, homogenize, totalize, control and make difficult the lives of the people.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Outspoken critic of Bolivian President Evo Morales, Silvia Rivera Cusicanqui, recently sat down to discuss the state of Bolivian politics with ICTMN.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/05/26/bolivian-historian-cusicanqui-starbucks-bolivia-go-hell-154999", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "image": "http://d1jrw5jterzxwu.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/article_media/silvia_rivera_cusicanqui_-_courtesy_liz_chezca_wikimedia_commons1.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "Bolivian Historian Cusicanqui: A Starbucks in Bolivia \u2013 \u2018Go to Hell!\u2019"}, "robots": "follow, index", "dc": {"title": "Bolivian Historian Cusicanqui: A Starbucks in Bolivia \u2013 \u2018Go to Hell!\u2019"}, "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/05/26/bolivian-historian-cusicanqui-starbucks-bolivia-go-hell-154999", "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.creator": "kpolisse", "dcterms.date": "2014-05-26T13:00-04:00", "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Evo Morales, Indigenous Government, Silvia Rivera Cusicanqui, Corruption, Development, Mining Law, Indigenous, Bolivian Government, Criticism", "validation_code": "d9d37d7b776cc351c4025ded3df21cad", "sioc": {"num_replies": 1}, "dcterms.title": "Bolivian Historian Cusicanqui: A Starbucks in Bolivia \u2013 \u2018Go to Hell!\u2019"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd6b8\"", "article_summary": "I used to teach at the Universidad Mayor de San Andr\u00e9s, which is the biggest public university in Bolivia.\nWe try to link every public issue where human rights, indigenous rights, and the rights of the Pachamama [Mother Earth] are involved.\nAnd it is therefore necessary to form a strong state.\nAnd I was very much involved in university politics, because I was trying to fight corruption in the university.\nWhat is your current work in Bolivia?"}
