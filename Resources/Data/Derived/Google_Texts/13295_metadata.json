Stapleton will survive the latest effort to purge its name, too. Still, it does raise the question of how far we should go in sanitizing place names and traditions in deference to modern values.\n\nIn the past few weeks alone, the Democratic Party in at least four states \u2014 Iowa, Connecticut, Missouri and Georgia \u2014 has decided to drop the names of former presidents Thomas Jefferson and Andrew Jackson from its big annual dinner because of their ties to slavery and Jackson\u2019s treatment of Indians. This prompted a Rutgers historian, Ross Baker, to wonder in USA Today, \u201cWho could possibly get through the vetting process of the Democratic activists passionate about purging the party of any individual who could possibly be offensive to anyone? Franklin Roosevelt, who presided over the internment of Japanese Americans? Harry Truman, who used the atomic bomb on civilians? Woodrow Wilson, who acclaimed D.W. Griffith\u2019s racist Birth of a Nation movie at a White House screening?\u201d\n\nBaker accused party activists of \u201cpresentism,\u201d which \u201cmercilessly subjects history and historical figures to contemporary social enlightenment. It is smug and self-satisfied \u2026 .\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s right about the insufferable smugness with regard to Jefferson and Jackson, given their remoteness to us.\n\nStapleton is a closer call.\n\nIn one sense Ben Stapleton was a man of his times, as the Klan was the most powerful political force in Colorado in the early 1920s and politicians curried its favor. But of course many Coloradans, particularly blacks, Catholics and Jews, had no illusions about the Klan\u2019s vile nature. If pandering to the Klan had been Stapleton\u2019s primary legacy and if he had not repudiated the organization later in his career, Black Lives Matter 5280 would have a better case.\n\nThe larger problem with revising place names and traditions to conform with modern sensibilities, however, is there is no end to it.\n\nIn Colorado, we have three counties named after slave-owning presidents, another named after George Armstrong Custer of Wounded Knee fame, and another, Montezuma, named for a ruler of one of the most cruel empires in history.\n\nThe town of Cortez is named for the ruthless conquistador who toppled Montezuma.\n\nEven a great and visionary man like John Evans \u2014 Mount Evans, Evans Boulevard \u2014 is not above reproach. He was territorial governor at the time of the Sand Creek massacre, for which some scholars maintain he bears a measure of culpability.\n\nSpeaking of that massacre, it is the main stain on the reputation of the founder of the Rocky Mountain News, the incomparable William Byers, whose surname is scattered about the region. His newspaper\u2019s reaction to the slaughter: \u201cBully for the Colorado boys.\u201d\n\nWhat are we make of the way so many people turn out to be imperfect? Accept it as a fact of human existence, perhaps?\n\nOr perhaps we could take a page from 19th century Breckinridge, named after vice president John C. Breckinridge. When townsfolk in 1861 learned that Breckinridge had sided with the Confederates, they changed the spelling to Breckenridge.\n\nThe Stapelton neighborhood, anyone?\n\nE-mail Vincent Carroll at vcarroll@denverpost.com.\n\nTo send a letter to the editor about this article, submit online or check out our guidelines for how to submit by e-mail or mail.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Carroll: Sanitizing Stapleton and other place names", "title": "Carroll: Sanitizing Stapleton and other place names", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/08/21/carroll-sanitizing-stapleton-and-other-place-names/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "height": 630}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-08-21T15:18:27+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-08-21T15:18:27+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9ee3\"", "article_summary": "Even a great and visionary man like John Evans \u2014 Mount Evans, Evans Boulevard \u2014 is not above reproach.\nWhen the group Black Lives Matter 5280 scattered flyers in Denver\u2019s Stapleton neighborhood recently to remind residents that \u201cYour neighborhood, Stapleton, was named after KKKlansman #1,128 Benjamin Stapleton,\u201d it wasn\u2019t the first time this unpleasant association had been raised.\nStill, it does raise the question of how far we should go in sanitizing place names and traditions in deference to modern values.\nOr perhaps we could take a page from 19th century Breckinridge, named after vice president John C.
