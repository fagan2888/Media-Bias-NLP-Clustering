The new rates go into effect Jan. 1, 2016.\n\nAny increase below 10 percent does not have to be publicly reported.\n\nAt last count, some 208,000 state residents buy their health insurance through Obamacare, with more than 80 percent of them getting help from the taxpayers in the form of a monthly subsidy.\n\nJust about half of them will see increases of more than 10 percent when it comes time to renew their policies this fall.\n\nHorizon Healthcare Services, Inc. has requested an average increase of 10.81 percent for two of its Advantage EPO plans. A third plan, the so-called catastrophic plan, which covers about two percent of Horizon's exchange enrollment, has a proposed price increase of 14.4 percent.\n\nIn all, 86,000 customers would have to pay more, according to the company's rate memorandum.\n\nThe other Advantage EPO plan, which is anticipated to have more than two-thirds of the Advantage EPO membership by the end of 2015, will see an increase below 10 percent, said company spokesman Tom Vincz.\n\nHe also indicated the company plans to offer five new \"competitively priced\" policies.\n\nOxford Health Plans (part of UnitedHealthcare) has requested a average price increase of 15.65 percent for policies in its IP HOM product line, according to its filing with the federal government. Within that product line, increases range from 0.8 percent to 24.2 percent, affecting about 6,000 customers.\n\nThe other carriers that opted to sell individual plans to New Jersey residents through the federal marketplace - AmeriHealth, Health Republic of New Jersey, and Oscar -- submitted no rate increase requests that hit 10 percent and thus triggered public disclosure.\n\nInsurers cite several factors pushing up their costs:\n\n\u2022 When Obamacare was first unrolled, insurance companies had access to federal funds -- called reinsurance -- to protect them from an anticipated surge of new patients who needed treatment for multiple conditions they may have ignored when they were uninsured. The amount of those payments has been reduced each year, by design, as companies become better able to set accurate rates for these new customers.\n\n\u2022 Some of the newer speciality prescription drugs are very expensive. While they account for just one percent of the prescriptions written, they account for 25 percent of insurance payments, said Sarah Adelman of the New Jersey Association of Health Plans.\n\n\u2022 \"The number of office visits continues to grow,\" reported Oxford in its filing.\n\nMost Jersey residents had a choice of anywhere from 35 to 50 plans, depending on the county in which they live. For example, the newest carrier to join the New Jersey market, Oscar, sells plans in just nine counties at this stage.\n\nThe final rates will be set by November, just in time for the start of the next ACA open enrollment period on Nov. 1.\n\nKathleen O'Brien may be reached at kobrien@njadvancemedia.com, or at (732) 902-4557.
