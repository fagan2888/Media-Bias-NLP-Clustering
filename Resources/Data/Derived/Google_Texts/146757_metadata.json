But overall, the launch of Obamacare was viewed by many as \"successful.\"\n\n\"The amount of interest we've seen and the way that the system is functioning overall, we're very happy,\" said Ben Davis, a spokesman for Colorado's marketplace Connect for Health Colorado, which drew 79,000 online visitors Tuesday.\n\nDavis said Colorado \"navigators\" \u2013 helpers charged with steering shoppers through the purchasing process \u2013 fielded roughly 3,700 live chats and calls on the first day the exchanges were open with an average phone call wait time of 3 minutes and 49 seconds.\n\n\"Frankly, it was a pretty successful day,\" he said, adding that about 5,500 people created accounts to purchase a plan. \"And based on what little numbers I've seen so far, traffic continues to be on pace with yesterday's in many respects.\"\n\nOregon's marketplace, Cover Oregon, drew roughly 122,000 visitors and 3,500 phone calls accounting for nearly 21 percent of uninsured people in Oregon, according to state officials.\n\n\"Our first day was a good day,\" Cover Oregon's executive director Howard King said in a statement. \"While we experienced some bumps, as we knew we would, we had a successful first day and I'm so grateful to our staff and partners for all they've done to get us here.\"\n\n\"We ask that you have patience as we work hard to fix bugs and update features in what we believe is a top-notch system for Oregonians,\" he added.\n\nAlthough the marketplaces were spared from federal furloughs, a surge in Web traffic has been blamed for frustrating lags and error messages throughout the day. Americans trying to scope out their options at HealthCare.gov are instructed to \"please wait\" for the login page, which in some cases took several minutes to appear.\n\n\"We have a lot of visitors on our site right now and we're working to make your experience here better,\" the site message reads. \"Thanks for your patience!\"\n\nRead about 10 things you need to know about the health insurance exchanges.\n\nHealth and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius warned Monday that \"glitches\" would be inevitable, comparing it to Apple's latest software upgrade.\n\nThe New York State of Health page had a similar message, explaining that 2 million people visited the site within the first two hours of launch, causing bottlenecks.\n\n\"We encourage users who are unable to log in to come back to the site later when these issues will be resolved,\" a message at the top of the site read.\n\nA sampling of state sites found that health exchange websites in Vermont, Connecticut, Kentucky and Washington were slow to load.\n\n\"Commonwealth of Kentucky citizens have shown tremendous response to KYNECT since we established our marketplace,\" a message on its site read. \"The KYNECT Website is currently experiencing log in issues and our technical team is working to resolve the problem.\"\n\nOther state health care exchanges, including California's, seem to be working normally.", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Heavy Traffic Delights Obamacare Insurance Sites", "description": "Despite sluggish websites and long phone call wait times, millions of Americans browsed their new health insurance options Tuesday, according to federal and state marketplace officials.", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 ABC News Internet Ventures", "author": "ABC News", "og": {"site_name": "ABC News", "description": "Despite sluggish websites and long phone call wait times, millions of Americans browsed their new health insurance options Tuesday, according to federal and state marketplace officials.", "title": "Heavy Traffic Delights Obamacare Insurance Sites", "url": "http://abcnews.go.com/Health/heavy-traffic-clogs-delights-obamacare-insurance-sites/story?id=20447403", "image": "http://a.abcnews.go.com/images/Health/GTY_healthcare_websites_jtm_131001_16x9_992.jpg", "type": "article"}, "Date": "2013-10-02", "twitter": {"description": "Despite sluggish websites and long phone call wait times, millions of Americans browsed their new health insurance options Tuesday, according to federal and state marketplace officials.", "title": "Heavy Traffic Delights Obamacare Insurance Sites", "url": "http://abcnews.go.com/Health/heavy-traffic-clogs-delights-obamacare-insurance-sites/story?id=20447403", "image": "http://a.abcnews.go.com/images/Health/GTY_healthcare_websites_jtm_131001_4x3t_240.jpg", "creator": "@slupkin", "site": "@ABC", "app": {"url": {"ipad": "abcnewsipad://link/story,20447403", "iphone": "abcnewsiphone://link/story,20447403", "googleplay": "android-app://com.abc.abcnews/abcnews/abcnews.go.com/Health/heavy-traffic-clogs-delights-obamacare-insurance-sites/story?id=20447403"}, "name": {"ipad": "ABC News", "iphone": "ABC News", "googleplay": "ABC News"}, "id": {"ipad": 306934135, "iphone": 300255638, "googleplay": "com.abc.abcnews"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "index, follow", "DC.date.issued": "2013-10-02", "al": {"ipad": {"url": "abcnewsipad://link/story,20447403", "app_store_id": 380520716, "app_name": "ABC News for iPad"}, "web": {"url": "http://abcnews.go.com/Health/heavy-traffic-clogs-delights-obamacare-insurance-sites/story?id=20447403"}, "android": {"url": "android-app://com.abc.abcnews/abcnews/abcnews.go.com/Health/heavy-traffic-clogs-delights-obamacare-insurance-sites/story?id=20447403", "app_name": "ABC News Breaking Latest News", "package": "com.abc.abcnews"}, "iphone": {"url": "abcnewsiphone://link/story,20447403", "app_store_id": 300255638, "app_name": "ABC News -
