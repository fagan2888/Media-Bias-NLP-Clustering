All presidents want to run up the score, particularly in their final year when days are few and the sense of urgency great. Jan. 20, 2017, is just around the corner, and Obama intends to keep plugging away on his legacy until the very end.\n\nThere\u2019s big stuff, of course: he and Ben Bernanke staved off another Great Depression. Like it or not, he got his way on some of his biggest goals: Obamacare, a nuclear deal with Iran, a global climate pact. It\u2019s all one big outrage to Republicans, but, because they\u2019ve spent as much time fighting with each other as they have with him, he\u2019s been able to keep scoring touchdowns.\n\nBut perhaps the biggest thing of all, something that few \u201cObama legacy\u201d stories have mentioned thus far is this: he has appointed two Supreme Court Justices, Sonia Sotomayor, and Elena Kagan. Putting these judicial allies\u2014who reflect his cultural and legal philosophy\u2014on the high court means that Obama\u2019s influence will be felt for years, perhaps decades, to come. Sotomayor, a Hispanic, has been a justice since 2009, but is still just 61. Kagan, who joined in 2010, is 55. In Supreme Court terms they are spring chickens: Four justices are 77 or older and the median age is 67.\n\nThe business implications of this cannot be overstated. In the last year alone, the court has ruled on cases with wide-ranging impacts on companies and investors: same-sex marriage, health care subsidies (an Obamacare win), what power the Environmental Protection Agency has over industry (too much, the court ruled), employment discrimination and pregnancy discrimination, among others. Decisions in all but one of these cases (the EPA case) pleased the White House, and in all of them, the votes of Sotomayor and Kagan helped win the day.\n\nObama would love to put at least one more justice on the court. He would leave office a year from now knowing that a full-third of it was his doing. There\u2019s nothing that would please him\u2014or infuriate Republicans\u2014more. But what would really be the icing on the cake for Obama: ending the court\u2019s ideological divide by replacing one of Ronald Reagan\u2019s two remaining appointees: Anthony Kennedy, 79, the court\u2019s current swing vote, and the hardcore conservative Antonin Scalia, who turns 80 in March. But neither has plans to retire anytime soon. At best, Obama could maintain the current split by replacing one of the two lefties: 82-year-old Ruth Bader Ginsburg, or 77-year-old Stephen Breyer. But both of them intend to stay put as well. It\u2019s probably a moot point anyway: Republican control of the Senate in this extreme hyper partisanship era means that any Obama appointee would never see the light of day.\n\nWhat happens if Clinton wins? She might in four years and almost certainly in eight, have the chance to replace both Kennedy and Scalia. Issues dear to liberals\u2014abortion rights, gun rights, affirmative action, immigration and the environment\u2014would likely move their way. But given likely Republican control of the Senate, at least between 2017-19, she\u2019d have trouble getting anyone through.\n\nAnd if a Republican wins the White House? The chance to replace one of the aging liberals like Ginsburg would almost certainly occur\u2014plus the opportunity to replace elderly conservatives like Scalia with younger clones who\u2019ll hang around for decades. The issues mentioned above\u2014would almost certainly tilt to the right.\n\nMeantime, this question: What if a court vacancy opens up, leaving a four-to-four ideological split\u2014but that gridlock between the White House and Senate is so severe that no nominee is approved? It could happen if, say, Hillary Clinton wins the presidency, and Republicans retain control of the Senate\u2014as they\u2019re expected to. Even if a Republican wins the presidency it could happen, because the 60-vote filibuster remains the threshold for Supreme Court nominations, and Democrats would take full advantage.\n\nThis could benefit liberals. Why? Because, as legal scholar Linda Hirshman notes in the Washington Post, \u201can eight-member court would often divide 4 to 4, affirming the decisions of the predominantly liberal lower courts.\u201d She notes that most circuit courts \u2014 the step below the high court \u2014 are controlled by liberal judges, lifetime appointees who hold sway even over states that vote Republican in presidential elections.\n\nIt\u2019s all kind of messy, but for business and economic matters that may bubble up to the Supreme Court in 2017 or beyond, here\u2019s the bottom line: if, say, Ted Cruz or Donald Trump wins the White House and nominates a right-wing justice, Senate Democrats, who are in the minority, would filibuster it to death. If Clinton wins, Senate Republicans, who would be in the majority, would also block any liberal nominee. But, as Hirshman notes, \u201cLiberal dominance of the lower courts, however, might make the GOP disinclined to hold out indefinitely.\u201d In other words, advantage Hillary.\n\nMore from MarketWatch", "article_metadata": {"lifp_basePath": "https://id.marketwatch.com/access", "twitter": {"domain": "marketwatch.com", "description": "Obama would love to put at least one more justice on the Supreme Court, writes Paul Brandus.", "creator": "@WestWingReport", "image": {"width": 1320, "identifier": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-DI159_afford_ZG_20150323090935.jpg", "height": 742}, "site": {"id": 624413}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "parsely-author": "Paul Brandus", "article.content_group": "marketwatch", "article.section": "Economy & Politics", "parsely-type": "post", "description": "Obama would love to put at least one more justice on the Supreme Court, writes Paul Brandus.", "parsely-link": "http://www.marketwatch.com/story/obamas-last-big-wish-another-supreme-court-appointment-2016-01-08", "author": "Paul Brandus", "parsely-title": "Obama\u2019s last big wish: another Supreme Court appointment", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=336693422", "parsely-pub-date": "2016-01-08T06:48:00-05:00", "page.site": "marketwatch", "robots": "noarchive,noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 283204329838}, "parsely-section": "MW_Economy & Politics", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/marketwatch"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "og": {"site_name": "MarketWatch", "description": "Obama would love to put at least one more justice on the Supreme Court, writes Paul Brandus.", "title": "Obama\u2019s last big wish: another Supreme Court appointment", "url": "http://www.marketwatch.com/story/obamas-last-big-wish-another-supreme-court-appointment-2016-01-08", "image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-DI159_afford_ZG_20150323090935.jpg", "type": "article"}, "ob": {"image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-DI159_afford_ZG_20150323090935.jpg"}, "article.id": "CDD5019C-B586-11E5-87B2-F2E93B0CEEE8", "position": 1}, "article_summary": "In Supreme Court terms they are spring chickens: Four justices are 77 or older and the median age is 67.\nEven if a Republican wins the presidency it could happen, because the 60-vote filibuster remains the threshold for Supreme Court nominations, and Democrats would take full advantage.\nAnd if a Republican wins the White House?\nBut perhaps the biggest thing of all, something that few \u201cObama legacy\u201d stories have mentioned thus far is this: he has appointed two Supreme Court Justices, Sonia Sotomayor, and Elena Kagan.\nIf Clinton wins, Senate Republicans, who would be in the majority, would also block any liberal nominee."}
