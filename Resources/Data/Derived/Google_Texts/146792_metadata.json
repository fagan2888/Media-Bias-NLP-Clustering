New Yorkers make up nearly 13% of that overall number.\n\nIn the Empire State, ACA health insurance can be found through New York State of Health, the insurance marketplace operated by the New York State Department of Health.\n\nBetween Medicaid, Qualified Health Plans and Child Health Plus programs, more than two million New Yorkers have obtained affordable health coverage as part of Obamacare.\n\nIf you're uninsured or thinking about updating your insurance through the Marketplace for the year ahead, here\u2019s a word of caution: Don\u2019t wait to deliberate.\n\nSince open enrollment started last November, the Department of Health has reported a record response from New Yorkers seeking to sign up through New York State of Health. Last month it was averaging 34,000 calls per day through its customer service center, and its website, nystateofhealth.ny.gov, has been viewed more than 43 million times since enrollment started on Nov. 1.\n\nWith the Jan. 31 deadline for 2016 enrollment drawing nearer, the countdown for acquiring coverage is on.\n\n\u201cA lot of people are deadline driven, so unfortunately we see this sort of rush coming in toward the end of the month, right before a deadline,\u201d says Elizabeth Hagan, senior policy analyst for Families USA.\n\nMAJORITY OF NEW YORKERS QUALIFY FOR FINANCIAL AID IN STATE MARKETPLACE HEALTH PLANS\n\n\u201cI would encourage consumers to really not wait until the last minute, but to start now getting an idea of their plans. If there are any complications they can\u2019t answer, they have time to go back and get the information they need to finish their application. (Jan. 31) is likely to be a very busy day on all of the various state-based marketplaces, as well as healthcare.gov, so getting in there now would be a good idea.\u201d\n\nDespite being the third open enrollment period for Obamacare, there will be plenty of new information for people to consider this time around, says Karen Pollitz, senior fellow at the Kaiser Family Foundation.\n\n\u201cThis is the first year that the full tax cycle will have been in effect,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen you sign up for coverage in the marketplace and get a tax subsidy, you are required to file a tax return for that year. If you fail to do that, it\u2019s going to make it difficult for you to continue coverage in the marketplace in subsequent years. People who either didn\u2019t file at all or didn\u2019t file appropriately in 2015 should have received a letter from the IRS.\u201d\n\nAnother thing to watch for this year is a change in subsidy requirements, adds Pollitz.\n\n\u201cTo be eligible for subsidies in the Marketplace, you must not be eligible for subsidized coverage through a job \u2014 either your own or a family member\u2019s where you would be eligible to receive coverage as a spouse or a dependent.\u201d\n\nNew Yorkers will also benefit this year from a new, more affordable health insurance option for low-income residents known as the Essential Plan.\n\nHundreds of thousands of state residents whose incomes fall between 138% to 200% of the federal poverty level will be eligible to apply for the new program.\n\nThe Essential Plan is designed to offer the same basic health care coverage as any other Obamacare plan, but with the added benefits of no deductible, free preventative care services and a monthly premium of either $0 or $20, depending on income. New Yorkers can find more information about the new program at nystateofhealth.ny.gov.\n\nMedical clipboard and stethoscope.

Financial aid assistance can fluctuate from year to year depending on your circumstances, which means not taking time to compare your coverage options could wind up costing you money.\n\nNearly 75% of New Yorkers who signed up for Qualified Health Plans had their health care costs reduced by financial aid assistance in 2015, according to the DOH.\n\nNew Yorkers can use the interactive View Plans Now feature, found at nystateofhealth.ny.gov/individual, to anonymously compare health plans and check their eligibility for financial aid.\n\nWhen comparison shopping for health coverage, there are six factors to consider: premiums, out-of-pocket costs, metal levels, covered services, in-network doctors and drug formularies.\n\nAssessing any potential health insurance plan based on these six factors will help give the clearest understanding of its benefits and costs. Typically, out-of-pocket costs tend to be lower for health plans with higher monthly premiums. These costs include deductibles, co-pays and possibly co-insurance expenses.\n\nOne factor that will impact both your out-of-pocket costs and premiums is the metal level \u2014 bronze, silver, gold or platinum \u2014 you pick for your coverage plan.\n\nInsurance plans in the Marketplace are categorized by this four-tier system, and each tier offers the same basic coverage, though higher tiers might offer additional benefits to the insured not found at lower levels, such as dental and vision care.\n\nNo matter the plan or the metal level you opt to go with, every insurance plan under the Affordable Care Act covers the same 10 basic tenants: doctor visits, hospital stays, emergency care, maternity and newborn care, mental health and substance abuse disorder services, prescription drugs, rehabilitative and habilitative services and devices, laboratory services, preventative and wellness services, and chronic disease management.\n\nFinally, look to see which doctors, hospitals and prescription drugs are covered under a particular plan if you already have preferred providers or particular medications you want to ensure stay in your network.\n\nWhile financial assistance, tax credits and comparison shopping can all help save you money on your health insurance this year, there is one thing that will definitely cost you: failing to sign up for some form of coverage.\n\nUninsured individuals in 2016 face an Individual Mandate Penalty fee of 2.5% of their household income or $695 (whichever is larger).\n\n\u201cThere is a penalty for not having health insurance, and it has gone up again this year,\u201d Pollitz says.\n\n\u201cIt may be one reason why enrollment trends have picked up over where we were this time last year. It\u2019s an annual penalty, but it\u2019s assessed on a month-by-month basis. If you have your coverage in effect by March 1, you won\u2019t be penalized for being uninsured in January or February.\n\n\u201cSo if people have waited, they should really hurry up.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Jordan Galloway", "twitter": {"description": "With the Jan. 31 deadline for 2016 enrollment drawing nearer, the countdown for acquiring coverage is on.", "title": "Waiting to sign onto state marketplace health care is risky", "url": "http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/waiting-sign-state-markeptlace-health-care-risky-article-1.2491875", "image": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.2491874.1452473531!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/pediatric-doctor-examining-patient.jpg", "site": "@nydailynews", "card": "summary"}, "sailthru.tags": "Affordable Care Act deadline for 2016 enrollment", "parsely-author": "Jordan Galloway", "parsely-type": "article", "keywords": "Affordable Care Act deadline for 2016 enrollment", "nydn_tags": "obamacare", "news_keywords": "Affordable Care Act deadline for 2016 enrollment", "parsely-link": "http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/waiting-sign-state-markeptlace-health-care-risky-article-1.2491875", "parsely-title": "Waiting to sign onto state marketplace health care is risky", "sailthru.date": "2016-01-10T20:00:30-0500", "sailthru.title": "Waiting to sign onto state marketplace health care is risky", "nydn_section": "New York", "parsely-pub-date": "2016-01-11T01:00:30", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.2491874.1452473531!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/pediatric-doctor-examining-patient.jpg", "description": "With the Jan. 31 deadline for 2016 enrollment drawing nearer, the countdown for acquiring coverage is on.", "robots": "NOARCHIVE", "fb": {"admins": 1594068001, "app_id": 107464888913, "pages": 268914272540}, "msvalidate.01": "02916AAC0DA8B068EFE01D721E03ED7E", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/NYDailyNews/"}, "sailthru.description": "With the Jan. 31 deadline for 2016 enrollment drawing nearer, the countdown for acquiring coverage is on.", "viewport": "width=device-width, height=device-height, initial-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no", "parsely-section": "New York", "og": {"site_name": "NY Daily News", "description": "With the Jan. 31 deadline for 2016 enrollment drawing nearer, the countdown for acquiring coverage is on.", "title": "Waiting to sign onto state marketplace health care is risky", "url": "http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/waiting-sign-state-markeptlace-health-care-risky-article-1.2491875", "image": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.2491874.1452473531!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/pediatric-doctor-examining-patient.jpg", "type": "article"}, "parsely-tags": "obamacare", "parsely-image-url": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.2491874.1452473531!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/pediatric-doctor-examining-patient.jpg", "p": {"domain_verify": "78efe4f5c9935744af497772f68a0ee7"}, "nydn_byline": "Jordan Galloway", "sailthru.credits": "NEW YORK DAILY NEWS"}, "article_summary": "In the Empire State, ACA health insurance can be found through New York State of Health, the insurance marketplace operated by the New York State Department of Health.\nBetween Medicaid, Qualified Health Plans and Child Health Plus programs, more than two million New Yorkers have obtained affordable health coverage as part of Obamacare.\nAssessing any potential health insurance plan based on these six factors will help give the clearest understanding of its benefits and costs.\n\u201cThere is a penalty for not having health insurance, and it has gone up again this year,\u201d Pollitz says.\nNearly 75% of New Yorkers who signed up for Qualified Health Plans had their health care costs reduced by financial aid assistance in 2015, according to the DOH."}
