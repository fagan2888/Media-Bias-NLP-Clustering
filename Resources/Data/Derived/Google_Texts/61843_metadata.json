Hull and East Yorkshire Hospitals NHS Trust paid \u00a316,615 for medical health insurance for three people last year.\n\nJonathan Isaby, of the TaxPayers\u2019 Alliance, commented:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s deeply concerning if health regulators are unwilling to use the NHS. That these staff are tasked with reducing health inequalities rubs salt into the wound, given they have cover that millions can\u2019t afford.\u201d\n\nRoger Goss, the co-director of Patient Concern, added:\n\n\u201cWhy should we take any notice of Nice\u2019s vast output telling everyone else how to behave when a team set up to reduce health inequalities then flouts that principle by giving its own staff preferential healthcare?\u201d\n\nThe staff receiving private health insurance at Norwich and Hull hospitals are also thought have originally been hired by a private agency, and the NHS trust had to honour the terms of their original contracts.\n\nBarrie Brown, the national officer for health at trade union Unite, said:\n\n\u201cIt is astonishing that we have the NHS contracting out to the private sector health care for certain privileged categories of staff. This is public money being thrown at profit-hungry private healthcare companies.\u201d\n\nA spokeswoman for NICE said that it had nothing to add to the initial FoI response and could not comment on why the agency introduced the perks.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A group of staff on Britain's socialised National Health Service (NHS), originally hired by an agency set up to help \u201creduce health inequalities\u201d, are\u00a0having private health insurance given to them courtesy of the taxpayer.", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "A group of staff on Britain's socialised National Health Service (NHS), originally hired by an agency set up to help \u201creduce health inequalities\u201d, are\u00a0having private health insurance given to them courtesy of the taxpayer.", "title": "Britain's Socialised Health Service Paying for Staff to Go Private - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/12/GettyImages-97768522.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/london/2016/01/16/taxpayer-funds-private-health-care-for-nhs-staff/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A group of staff on Britain's socialised National Health Service (NHS), originally hired by an agency set up to help \u201creduce health inequalities\u201d, are\u00a0having private health insurance given to them courtesy of the taxpayer.", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/12/GettyImages-97768522.jpg", "title": "Britain's Socialised Health Service Paying for Staff to Go Private - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "health care, Hypocrisy, NHS, privatisation,Breitbart London,nhs", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Breitbart London", "tag": "privatisation", "published_time": "2016-01-16T04:24:15-07:00", "categories": "Breitbart London"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERA group of staff on Britain\u2019s socialised National Health Service (NHS), originally hired by an agency set up to help \u201creduce health inequalities\u201d, are having private health insurance given to them courtesy of the taxpayer.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERThe Health Development Agency was set up in 2000 to \u201cdevelop the evidence base to improve health and reduce health inequalities\u201d.\nHull and East Yorkshire Hospitals NHS Trust paid \u00a316,615 for medical health insurance for three people last year.\nA separate request found that Norfolk and Norwich University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust spent \u00a37,982 on three members of staff.\nBarrie Brown, the national officer for health at trade union Unite, said:\u201cIt is astonishing that we have the NHS contracting out to the private sector health care for certain privileged categories of staff."}
