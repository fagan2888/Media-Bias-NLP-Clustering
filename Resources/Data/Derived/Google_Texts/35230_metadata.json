Susan Brooks of Indiana said in the weekly Republican radio address Saturday that gaining access to Clinton\u2019s server is \u201cthe only way to truly know\u201d that investigators have obtained all the State Department communications that \u201crightfully belong to the American people.\u201d\n\nClinton acknowledged this past week that as the nation\u2019s top diplomat, she relied on a personal email account rather than one operated by the government.\n\nThe committee chairman Republican Rep. Trey Gowdy of South Carolina, has called on Clinton to turn over the server for an independent review; Clinton so far has rebuffed the request.\n\nGOP leaders have not ruled out a House vote to force Clinton to turn over the server, setting up a possible confrontation between the GOP-led Congress and the person who could be the Democratic front-runner for president in 2016.\n\nBrooks said in her address that the server could help her committee \u201canswer vital questions,\u201d including why requests for additional security at the Benghazi compound were denied, and why some members of the Obama administration appeared \u201cslow to acknowledge\u201d that a terrorist attack had occurred.\n\n\u201cIt is simply unacceptable for so many questions to remain unanswered,\u2019 Brooks said. \u201cAnd it is unjust and simply wrong for anyone to withhold evidence that may lead to the answers.\u201d\n\nPresident Barack Obama has promised that his administration would be the \u201cmost transparent administration in history,\u201d but Brooks said Clinton \u201chas fallen painfully short\u201d of that mark.\n\nClinton served as secretary of state during Obama\u2019s first term. She is widely considered the favorite for the Democratic nomination for president, although she has not announced her candidacy.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A member of the House committee investigating the deadly attacks against Americans in Benghazi, Libya, says Hillary Rodham Clinton's email server could help lawmakers answer vital questions.
