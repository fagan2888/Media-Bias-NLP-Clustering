Last week, six U.S soldiers were killed as they patrolled near Bagram air base outside Kabul and, last month, suicide attackers struck a Spanish embassy guesthouse in the capital.\n\nThe attacks have coincided with renewed efforts to revive a peace process with the Taliban that broke down in July after news came out that the movement's leader, Mullah Mohammad Omar, had died two years earlier.\n\nOfficials from Afghanistan, Pakistan, the United States and China are due to meet in Pakistan on Jan. 11 for a meeting aimed at laying the groundwork for talks with the insurgents.\n\nHowever the Taliban, which is struggling to contain bloody factional fighting over the leadership succession, has so far refused to take part while foreign forces remain in Afghanistan.\n\nAfghan President Ashraf Ghani, who said this week that terrorism had to end for the talks to succeed, condemned the latest attack.\n\n(Additional reporting by Hamid Shalizi and James Mackenzie; Editing by Kevin Liffey)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "KABUL (Reuters) - A suicide attack on a French restaurant in the Afghan capital Kabul", "title": "Suicide bombing hits restaurant in Afghan capital Kabul", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/01/01/Loud-blast-hits-Afghan-capital-Kabul-witnesses", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/afghanistan-blast_2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/01/01/Loud-blast-hits-Afghan-capital-Kabul-witnesses", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/afghanistan-blast_2.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "KABUL (Reuters) - A suicide attack on a French restaurant in the Afghan capital Kabul", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "KABUL (Reuters) - A suicide attack on a French restaurant in the Afghan capital Kabul on Friday killed a 12-year-old boy and wounded more than a dozen other people, officials said.\nThe latest in a series of suicide bombings in Kabul targeted \"Le Jardin\", one of a small number of restaurants in the city still frequented by foreigners.\nLast week, six U.S soldiers were killed as they patrolled near Bagram air base outside Kabul and, last month, suicide attackers struck a Spanish embassy guesthouse in the capital.\nAfghan President Ashraf Ghani, who said this week that terrorism had to end for the talks to succeed, condemned the latest attack.\nEarlier this week, one civilian was killed and 33 were wounded in an attack claimed by the Taliban in an area close to Kabul airport."}
