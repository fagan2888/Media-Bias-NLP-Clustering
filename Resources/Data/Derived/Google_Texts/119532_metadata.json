More than 600,000 of those companies\u2019 employees and their family members are covered this year by insurance available through the exchange.\n\nAmong the four pricing tiers (designated as platinum, gold, silver and bronze) in Aon Hewitt\u2019s exchange, 73 percent chose one of the two lowest-priced ones (see chart, \u201cGoing for the Silver\u201d).\n\nFor both Aon Hewitt and some of the other exchange vendors, the metallic levels are generally defined the same as they are by the public exchanges, created under the Affordable Care Act, which started enrolling people this year.\n\nA \u201csilver\u201d plan, for example, has an \u201cactuarial value\u201d of 70 percent (plus or minus a couple of percentage points), which means the plan pays for that share of health-care costs while enrollees pay the rest through some combination of deductibles, copayments and coinsurance. The actuarial values of bronze, gold and platinum plans are 60 percent, 80 percent and 90 percent, respectively. A plan with a value of, say, 85 percent might be called \u201cgold-plus.\u201d\n\nGenerally, the more employees pay for deductibles, copays and coinsurince, the less comes out of their paychecks for the insurance itself. An employee choosing a bronze plan, say, may be making a bet that he will stay healthy and thereby avoid the costs of deductibles and copays.\n\n\u201cWe had postulated that private exchanges would accelerate the movement toward consumerism in employer-provided health care, where people have more to say about the cost of care they receive, and these results validate that to some degree,\u201d says Michael Thompson, a principal in the health-care practice at PricewaterhouseCoopers. \u201cOverall, these are encouraging results. We\u2019re seeing a lot of people right-sizing their coverage when they fully understand the trade-off between the cost of coverage and what they\u2019re getting.\u201d\n\n(PwC is part of the Private Exchange Evaluation Collaborative, a broad-based group that aims to provide unbiased information and insight on the private-exchange industry. PwC does not offer an exchange of its own.)\n\nTwo of the three initial clients that Aon Hewitt signed up for its exchange for 2013, Darden Restaurants and Sears Holdings (the third was the consulting firm itself), employ large numbers of low-wage workers. Among large companies, they\u2019re of the type that was thought at first to be the most likely source of clients for private exchanges.\n\nBut the other 15 companies Aon Hewitt brought into the stable this year represent a diversity of industries, including wholesale trade, business and professional services, hospitality, health care, technology, communications, financial services and manufacturing. Its competitor Mercer, which is serving at least 33 companies with its private exchange this year, has a similarly varied client list.\n\nInterestingly, among the first-year participants in Aon Hewitt\u2019s exchange \u2014 a large majority of them being those low-paid Darden and Sears workers \u2014 fewer actually opted for the silver and bronze tiers than did the employees in Aon\u2019s full customer base. And that tendency was more pronounced this year than last (see chart, \u201cSecond Time Around\u201d).\n\nThat\u2019s not surprising to Thomas Mangan, CEO of United Benefit Advisors, a benefits consultancy. \u201cThe people who can least afford it often are the ones most willing to pay more for a richer plan,\u201d he says. \u201cEven though hospitals generally will negotiate payment plans for such people, they are worried that a hospital stay will bankrupt them.\u201d\n\nOverall, the second-year selections by the three original clients show a slight proclivity for less-rich plans in the second year. \u201cOne of the primary goals of our exchange is to bring down the rate of increase in health-care costs to something that looks more like the general inflation rate,\u201d says Ken Sperling, Aon Hewitt\u2019s national exchange strategy leader.\n\nThere is room for improvement there: The firm\u2019s three original exchange clients are paying an average 5.1 percent higher premiums this year, while the U.S. inflation rate was 1.5 percent in 2013 and is trending at 1.6 percent this year, according to USInflation.org.\n\nNotes Thompson, \u201cThat 5.1 percent increase in health-care costs is in line with what many companies are seeing,\u201d he says. \u201cBut it\u2019s still good news for the exchanges. It shows that the insurance carriers that are in the exchanges are still competing hard for members.\u201d\n\nSome observers had expected that carriers would entice companies with artificially low rates for the first year of exchange participation and ratchet up the pricing in future years. \u201cThis is a positive sign for the sustainability of those initial rates,\u201d Thompson says.\n\nThe carriers in Aon Hewitt\u2019s exchange didn\u2019t all have the same approach to cost hikes for the second year, Sperling notes. Some increased all the tiers by the same percentage, and some hiked the platinum and gold tiers by more than the bronze and silver tiers, he says.\n\nHours after Aon Hewitt released its data, Towers Watson communicated some corresponding information to CFO. For this year, its first serving active employees with a private exchange, 16 percent of participants chose a gold plan, 29 percent picked silver, 28 percent bronze and 27 percent what the firm calls \u201csafety net\u201d coverage. Towers Watson doesn\u2019t offer a platinum option.\n\nWhile Aon Hewitt offers only fully insured plans through its exchange, Towers Watson offers self-insured plans (as well as fully insured). For that reason, the actuarial values of its tiers don\u2019t perfectly correspond to those of the public exchanges, says Cathy Tripp, leader of OneExchange Active, Towers Watson\u2019s exchange for active employees. The consulting firm\u2019s values are in the mid-80 percent range for gold plans, and the high 70s, high 60s and low 60s for silver, bronze and safety-net plans, respectively.\n\n\u201cEmployees can optimize their health-care dollars from their take-home pay by buying up and buying down compared to their previous group plans,\u201d says Tripp. \u201cMany were over-insured and can now get perfectly adequate coverage for less. But actually, more than expected bought up to get better coverage than before.\u201d\n\nNeither Mercer nor Buck Consultants, the other two consulting firms with exchanges for active employees, provided by press time information on pricing-tier selections.\n\nMeanwhile, Aon Hewitt\u2019s exchange participants liked having greater choice among carriers even more than having greater choice among plan types, notes Sperling. Eighty-seven percent of them said they liked plentiful carrier options. Participants in the firm\u2019s exchange can choose from among three or four options, depending on where they are located. With some other exchanges, there are only one or two carrier options.\n\n\u201cThat result was a bit of a surprise,\u201d Sperling says. \u201cBut what it tells us is that when companies drop their employees into new carriers, it\u2019s pretty disruptive. With multiple carriers available, people can get their old doctors back.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s less surprising to Thompson that carrier choice outweighs plan choice. \u201cOften people have a coverage level in mind, so being able to choose from other coverage levels may not matter to them,\u201d he says. Anyway, he notes, many large companies already offered plans from multiple carriers.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "aon hewitt, cathy tripp, consulting, darden, employer-sponsored health insurance, health care costs, insurance, ken sperling, michael thompson, oneexchange active, private exchange, private exchange evaluation collaborative, sears, thomas mangan, towers watson", "generator": "Easy Digital Downloads v2.2.2", "author": "David McCann", "og": {"site_name": "CFO", "description": "Exchange participants can either 'buy up' or 'buy down' compared to their previous coverage, but most do the latter rather than opt for better insurance.", "title": "Employees Seek Cost Savings from Private Health Insurance Exchanges", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.cfo.com/content/uploads/2014/03/478394023.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-06-10T17:16:27+00:00", "url": "http://ww2.cfo.com/health-benefits/2014/03/employees-seek-cost-savings-private-health-insurance-exchanges/", "type": "article"}, "media": "Article", "twitter": {"domain": "CFO", "description": "Exchange participants can either 'buy up' or 'buy down' compared to their previous coverage, but most do the latter rather than opt for better insurance.", "creator": "@cfo", "title": "Employees Seek Cost Savings from Private Health Insurance Exchanges", "site": "@cfo", "card": "summary", "account_id": 44906914}, "topicRoot": "Human Capital & Careers", "topic": "Health Benefits", "headline": "Employees Seek Cost Savings from Private Health Insurance Exchanges", "fb": {"admins": 15609421}, "contextly-page": "{\"title\":\"Employees Seek Cost Savings from Private Health Insurance Exchanges\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.cfo.com\\/health-benefits\\/2014\\/03\\/employees-seek-cost-savings-private-health-insurance-exchanges\\/\",\"pub_date\":\"2014-03-06 14:25:20\",\"mod_date\":\"2015-06-10 17:16:27\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":81960,\"author_id\":\"6\",\"author_name\":null,\"author_display_name\":\"David McCann\",\"tags\":[\"Aon Hewitt\",\"Cathy Tripp\",\"consulting\",\"Darden\",\"employer-sponsored health insurance\"],\"categories\":[\"Corporate Finance\",\"Growth Companies\",\"Health Benefits\",\"Human Capital &amp; Careers\"],\"image\":\"http:\\/\\/cdn.cfo.com\\/content\\/uploads\\/2014\\/03\\/478394023.jpg\"}", "date": 20140306, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/CFOConferences", "section": "Human Capital & Careers", "tag": "Towers Watson", "published_time": "2014-03-06T14:25:20+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-06-10T17:16:27+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "Exchange participants can either 'buy up' or 'buy down' compared to their previous coverage, but most do the latter rather than opt for better insurance."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd38e3\"", "article_summary": "Judging by newly released data on health-care choices made by employees at companies offering insurance through private exchanges, most people would rather save money than have better insurance.\nMore than 600,000 of those companies\u2019 employees and their family members are covered this year by insurance available through the exchange.\nAmong large companies, they\u2019re of the type that was thought at first to be the most likely source of clients for private exchanges.\nIts competitor Mercer, which is serving at least 33 companies with its private exchange this year, has a similarly varied client list.\nAon Hewitt, one of four large human-capital consulting firms that offer private exchanges for active employees, on Thursday revealed the 2014 selections by employees of the 18 corporate customers of its exchange."}
