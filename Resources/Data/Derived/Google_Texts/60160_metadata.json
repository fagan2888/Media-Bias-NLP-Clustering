In their suit, Dordt College v. Sebelius, the schools argue that the mandate violates the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA) and is unconstitutional.\n\n\u201cThe Schools hold, as a matter of religious conviction, that it would be sinful and immoral for them intentionally to participate in, pay for, facilitate, enable, or otherwise support access to abortion, which destroys human life.\u201d\n\nRFRA states that the government must have a compelling state interest, as well as pursue the least restrictive means of furthering that interest, when it comes to restricting religious freedom. U.S. District Judge Mark Bennett, who handed down the decision, wrote that the probable harm to the two colleges was greater than that of the supporters of the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cThey believe that God has condemned the intentional destruction of innocent human life,\u201d the lawsuit states. \u201cThe Schools hold, as a matter of religious conviction, that it would be sinful and immoral for them intentionally to participate in, pay for, facilitate, enable, or otherwise support access to abortion, which destroys human life.\u201d\n\nThe court\u2019s decision only affects employees of the universities, which were represented by Alliance Defending Freedom, and not their students. For Dordt, that means it affects 191 employees it insures and their dependents.\n\nDordt President Erik Hoekstra said that, \u201c[w]e\u2019ll continue to monitor the situation, but we\u2019re hopeful, and we expect the courts to ultimately reach the correct conclusion and protect religious freedom by declaring enforcement of the mandate unconstitutional.\u201d\n\nHowever, this decision is only temporary; the U.S. Supreme Court is expected to rule soon on similar situations regarding craft store Hobby Lobby and wood company Conestoga. Bennett said that he expects his ruling to be upheld if it is appealed.\n\nFollow the author of this article on Twitter: @samantha_reinis", "article_metadata": {"category": "News", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://www.campusreform.org/img/CROBlog/5634/College.jpg", "description": "A federal court halted enforcement of Obamacare for two Christian colleges on Wednesday, a victory for those against employers paying for contraceptives, including the controversial \u201cmorning-after pill.\u201d", "og": {"site_name": "Campus Reform", "description": "A federal court halted enforcement of Obamacare for two Christian colleges on Wednesday, a victory for those against employers paying for contraceptives, including the controversial \u201cmorning-after pill.\u201d", "title": "Federal judge rules Christian colleges don\u2019t have to comply with Obamacare contraception mandate", "url": "http://www.campusreform.org/?ID=5634", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://www.campusreform.org/img/CROBlog/5634/College.jpg", "height": 600}, "author": "Samantha Reinis", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "image": "http://www.campusreform.org/img/CROBlog/5634/College.jpg", "fb": {"admins": 19226500, "app_id": 127484367480}, "keywords": ",CornerstoneCollege,Dordt College,ReligiousFreedom Restoration Act,Constitution,Obamacare,Contraception Mandate,Hobby Lobby,Conestoga,Alliance Defending Freedom, Samantha Reinis", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/CampusReform", "published_time": "2014-05-22 12:06:25.0", "description": "A federal court halted enforcement of Obamacare for two Christian colleges on Wednesday, a victory for those against employers paying for contraceptives, including the controversial \u201cmorning-after pill.\u201d", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/CampusReform", "section": "News", "modified_time": "2014-05-22 12:06:25.0"}, "twitter": {"description": "A federal court halted enforcement of Obamacare for two Christian colleges on Wednesday, a victory for those against employers paying for contraceptives, including the controversial \u201cmorning-after pill.\u201d", "title": "Federal judge rules Christian colleges don\u2019t have to comply with Obamacare contraception mandate", "image": {"src": "http://www.campusreform.org/img/CROBlog/5634/College.jpg"}, "creator": "@samantha_reinis", "site": "@campusreform", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce45b\"", "article_summary": "In their suit, Dordt College v.
