Topic: Obamacare, Sissel v. HHS, Origination Clause of the Constitution

The brief traces the historical foundation of the Origination Clause, demonstrating that the chamber closest to the people and elected every two years has the sole power to originate revenue raising bills. The Origination Clause, found in Article 1, Section 7 of the U.S. Constitution, requires that "All Bills for raising Revenue shall originate in the House of Representatives; but the Senate may propose or concur with Amendments as on other Bills." Obamacare, which was upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court on the grounds that it was a tax (aka a "Bill for raising Revenue") instead originated in the Senate.
