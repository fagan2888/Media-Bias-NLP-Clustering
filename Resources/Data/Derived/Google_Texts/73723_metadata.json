The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit ruled that the Sisters had been provided a sufficient way to \u201copt out\u201d of the ACA\u2019s requirement while still offering free contraceptive care through their insurance providers.\n\nAt the heart of the decision was a disagreement over what constituted a violation of religious liberty.\n\nThe decision came shortly after new rules were issued by The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) on another aspect of the dispute. The rules extend an accommodation to closely held for-profit corporations such as Hobby Lobby, which also object to the contraception mandate, that religious groups can use. It requires groups with religious objections to sign and deliver a form passing the responsibility of providing contraceptive care on to the government, which in turn finds a third party provider.\n\nIt is that very accommodation to which the Little Sisters still object. They reject the appeals court ruling that the act of signing the accommodation form does \u201cnot substantially burden their religious exercise\u201d or \u201cinfringe upon their First Amendment rights.\u201d\n\nKnow a recent high school graduate? Share this great article with them before they're off to college!\n\n\n\nDaniel Blomberg, legal counsel for the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, a non-profit public interest law firm which represents the Little Sisters, explained why.\n\n\u201cThere are two pieces to the problem,\u201d he said. \u201cThe first is that the government has set up this contraceptive delivery form, and its forcing people to sign that.\u201d\n\nThe Little Sisters and other groups who object to the form argue that the act of signing it amounts to providing contraceptives in the first place. It assists the process, in other words, and \u201cthat act itself violates their faith,\u201d Blomberg said.\n\n\u201cAnd then there\u2019s what the form does,\u201d he said, \u201cand that is that it accomplishes a take over of the religious ministries plans.\u201d\n\nThe government is \u201cparasitically adding to the [Little Sisters] healthcare plan another required benefit,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s outsourcing [the responsibility], but it\u2019s also insourcing it. They\u2019re getting somebody else to come do it, but that other person can only do it once the little sister sign the document, and the place it\u2019s all being done is in [the Little Sisters\u2019] healthcare plan, in the healthcare delivery structure that they\u2019ve created.\u201d\n\nBlomberg said an alternative would be to send employees of the Little Sisters of the Poor seeking contraceptive care straight to the government\u2019s healthcare system, to Obamacare.\n\nBut the \u201cgovernment\u2019s argument is that [they] shouldn\u2019t have to do that,\u201d he said, that they \u201cshould be able to use the structure of [the Little Sisters\u2019] health plan,\u201d and so, in essence, \u201cyou have federal judges coming in talking to Catholic nuns and basically saying, \u2018You don\u2019t understand your Catholic faith well enough. The thing that you think you can\u2019t do, you actually can do, and it\u2019s okay.\u2019\u201d\n\nSr. Simone Campbell, Executive Director of NETWORK, a Catholic social justice lobby, emphatically rejected that interpretation.\n\n\u201cNo, no, no,\u201d she said. \u201cHere\u2019s the accommodation: [the Little Sisters] have to sign a form saying that they are a religious institute and that they have religious objection to including the contraceptive coverage. That\u2019s all they have to do. And then it\u2019s not provided through their insurance. But what a woman can do is\u2026can get access to it from the third party, not from the Little Sisters.\u201d\n\nCampbell, who is an attorney, attributed the turmoil over the ruling to \u201cthe [political] Right\u2019s effort to scuttle the Affordable Care Act.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s yet another effort to promote a very narrow view,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd the piece that I don\u2019t understand is how they can even think that their religious liberty trumps everybody else\u2019s. That\u2019s the puzzle to me. In a pluralistic society we should be about finding ways where everyone can exercise his or her conscience.\u201d\n\nLisa Cahill, a moral theologian at Boston College, said the disagreement revolves around the theological concept of the \u201cprincipal of cooperation.\u201d\n\n\u201cEssentially this principle holds that formal cooperation with evil (ie, one intends that it happen) is never permissible,\u201d she wrote in an email. \u201cHowever, material cooperation (one supplies some means or support, but one does not want it to happen) is justified under certain conditions, such as: the evil will happen with or without one's cooperation; one acts under duress; there is a proportionate reason; and the more \u2018remote\u2019 (the less closely connected to the evil act) the cooperation is the easier it is to justify it.\n\n\u201cI think most would see this as a case of very remote material cooperation,\u201d she wrote, adding that additional considerations exist relating to proportionality, like, \u201cthe good of providing national health insurance reform and more accessible services; the good of serving more women clients in multiple ways; the good of serving the poor, who will not have enhanced access to health care.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, \u201cPope Francis has said explicitly and shown by example that Catholics need to take the public focus off sex, gender, and reproductive issues, and put it elsewhere, especially on poverty,\u201d Cahill wrote. \u201cGoing to the barricades on this issue in a public way does not seem consistent with that spirit.\u201d\n\nMore decisions involving this disagreement will be coming down in circuit courts in the coming days, Blomberg said.\n\nAccording to the National Law Journal, \u201cThe Supreme Court has several pending petitions for review filed by religious nonprofits challenging the accommodation. Priests for Life v. Department of Health & Human Services and Roman Catholic Archbishop of Washington v. Burwell are from the D.C. Circuit; Houston Baptist University v. Burwell is from the Fifth Circuit; and Zubik v. Burwell is from the Third Circuit.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe endgame will be at the U.S. Supreme Court,\u201d Blomberg said.\n\n[Vinnie Rotondaro is NCR national correspondent.
