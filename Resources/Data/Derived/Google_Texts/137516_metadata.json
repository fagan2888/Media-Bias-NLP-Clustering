He worked in the Reagan White House, the George H.W. Bush Treasury Department, for former Texas Rep. Ron Paul and the Heritage Foundation. So when he saw Republicans doing things he believed damaged the brand, he said so, and was surprised to find himself first ignored, then struck from the rolls of the GOP talk-ocracy, and even fired from his think tank job. And that, he says, is the problem. Bartlett, who is now an independent, made headlines recently with a scholarly paper about Fox News. In it, he describes a media \"bubble\" that imperils the GOP by screening out ideas that challenge Republican orthodoxy \u2014 in other words, those inconvenient truths.\n\nWhat was the genesis of the Fox paper?\n\nIn 2004, I was extensively quoted in a New York Times magazine article [critical of President George W. Bush's decision-making]. I assumed my conservative friends would give me a lot of trouble, but nobody said a word. I finally started asking, \"What did you think?\" Every single one gave me the same answer: \"I don't read the New York Times.\" Many were mildly insulted that I would think they would read what from their point of view was the equivalent of Pravda.\n\nThis was the first indication I had of the bubble conservatives now live in. The fact that they would consciously close themselves off to this key source of information came as a revelation. It's gotten much worse in the last 10 years as conservative media have become more available; Fox is just the biggest. Inside the bubble, certain facts are never heard because they're inconvenient to the conservative worldview. Global warming is probably the biggest but hardly the only one.\n\nYou're no longer a Republican yet you're concerned that bubble-think could damage GOP electability.\n\nA lot of conservatives are a bit worried about this. They understand this isn't good for the party. It's going to hurt us in 2016 because if we have people who are not serious candidates, making ridiculous arguments about Obama's invasion of Texas and other crackpot issues, all Hillary has to do is nothing.\n\nYet Republicans control Congress and many state legislatures, so how is this bubble damaging the GOP?\n\n[For example,] the 2012 drumbeat on Fox that polls showing [Mitt] Romney losing were wrong; this was considered gospel in the conservative world: \"Of course Romney is ahead because our ideas are so popular.\" To the extent that it affected Republican strategy, they may have deluded themselves into a defeat. If you think your guy is behind, you work a little harder.\n\nA Kentucky state GOP senator told a legislative hearing, \"We all agree that the temperature on Mars is exactly as it is here.\" But Mars is much colder than Earth. What happened to being entitled to your own opinions but not your own facts?\n\nThere seems to be a kind of nonaggression pact among non-bubble media not to say ... that Fox is not a legitimate news source, it's a propaganda source. \u2014 Bruce Bartlett\n\nThis is a severe problem for democracy itself. We can't go back to the old days of half-hour news broadcasts on the three major networks, when people were forced to have a common source of information, at least on a few issues. [Now] it's a rare day that somebody doesn't go into business with some new conservative news site. These people are good at worming their way into the system. There seems to be a kind of nonaggression pact among non-bubble media not to say the emperor is wearing no clothes \u2014 that Fox is not a legitimate news source, it's a propaganda source.\n\nWhat do you think is Fox's end game?\n\nSo far they have not been confronted by any contradiction between their support for a conservative worldview and making money and getting ratings. They tell themselves nobody is forced to watch; that if someone wants a different point of view, all they have to do is change the channel.\n\nThe path for Republican presidential hopefuls seems to run through Fox.\n\nI think that's right. One consequence [is] the huge number of candidates. Historically, the way the Republican Party has operated, there's one guy that everybody agrees: \"It's your turn.\" That was true for [John] McCain, for Romney, for Bob Dole before that. Now it's easy for [candidates] to overcome the threshold of name ID because there's so much conservative media out there that they will legitimize candidates for their own purpose of gaining audiences. In the old days, the news media had a winnowing effect that prevented crackpots and people with no chance from getting any traction.\n\nMany of these candidates have very close connections to Fox News. [Mike] Huckabee had a show for years, building his audience and in the process building an organization for his campaign.\n\nNobody in his right mind would defend child sexual molestation unless they're so deep in the bubble that the first reaction is, I have to defend these people because they're part of my constituency. That Huckabee would do something like that [Huckabee defended the repentance of reality show personality Josh Duggar, who has admitted to wrongdoing related to molestation \"mistakes\" he made as a teenager] seems patently absurd, without reference to the bubble.\n\nHow has Fox news changed since it started in 1996?\n\nRight after 9/11, whether it was market-driven or ideological, Fox made a decision to move further to the right. When Fox first came on the air, they were to the right of most other major media by virtue of being in the center because the others tilted a bit to the left. They could honestly say, \"We're fair and balanced.\" Fox moved to the right at a time the whole country moved to the right. One commentator said [that] in many ways Fox is not so much conservative as it is anti-liberal.", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Can Bruce Bartlett save the GOP by bursting its 'bubble'?", "googlebot": "index", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times", "author": "Los Angeles Times", "og": {"site_name": "latimes.com", "description": "Bruce Bartlett has 24-karat conservative credentials.
