The 1033 program is in the spotlight because of the so-called militarization of police in Ferguson, Missouri, after protests about the death of Michael Brown, a black teenager who was shot and killed by a white police officer.\n\nRelated: The Pentagon Equipped Ferguson\u2019s Police Dept.\n\nSince Congress first approved the 1033 program in 1990, local police have received more than $5.1 billion in military-grade property \u2013 from surplus desks to Mine Resistant Ambush P (MRAPS), M-16s, and Kevlar body armor. In 2013 alone, more than $449 million in military equipment was transferred; the Department of Homeland Security, the Justice Department and FEMA paid for it through grants appropriated by Congress.\n\nAlthough DOD officials say Ferguson police did not use any of its military-grade tactical equipment (which is still under review in a separate federal investigation), the war zone-like images that came out of Ferguson sparked new concerns.\n\n\u201cThere is no role for the federal government in state and local police forces in our country,\u201d Sen. Tom Coburn (R-OK) said Tuesday. The longtime deficit hawk pointed out that a tiny police department in his home state had received two MRAPs from the Pentagon though it only has one full time police officer.\n\nRelated: Ferguson Could End Militarizing Local Police Forces\n\nAlan Estevez, the Pentagon\u2019s principal deputy undersecretary for acquisition, technology, and logistics, pointed out that \u201cwe do this because we\u2019re asked to do this,\u201d implying that it was Congress who approved the 1033 program in the first place.\n\nA document obtained by The Fiscal Times from the office of Missouri Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill who ran the hearing revealed similar details. A small Pennsylvania County police department, for example, also received an MRAP from the Pentagon, despite having just five police officers.\n\nThe problem, according to lawmakers, is that some of these small-town police officers may not be trained to handle the military equipment. \u201cThis is crazy, out of control,\u201d Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) said.\n\nEstevez responded, \u201cThere is a lot of opportunity for improvement regarding the discussion on training.\u201d\n\nRelated: Ferguson Unrest Prompts a Cop\u2019s Blunt Op Ed\n\nHe and other officials noted that military equipment has played a \u201ccrucial role\u201d in saving lives and disaster response. Estevez said N.J. police officers, for example, used Humvees to rescue Hurricane Sandy victims who were in water too high for police vehicles to reach; he also said military equipment was used after the Boston bombings to capture Dzhokhar Anzorovich \u201cJahar\u201d Tsarnaev.\n\nEstevez said his department \u201cdoes not push equipment on law enforcement departments,\u201d as they have to request it. Still, nearly all of the officials agreed that oversight of the 1033 program as well as the grants needs to be improved.\n\nThat wasn\u2019t enough for some lawmakers. \u201cI am confident that militarizing police tactics are not consistent with the peaceful exercise of First Amendment rights of free speech and free assembly,\u201d McCaskill said.\n\nSeparately, McCaskill blasted the DOD for distributing equipment that in many cases is new or barely used. \u201cWhy are we buying new things at the DOD just to give it away?\u201d she asked. \u201cAlmost 40 percent of what you are giving away has never been used by the military\u2026\u201d\n\nDOD officials said they only give away things the military doesn\u2019t use. \u201cAs our budget changes, things that we thought we would need, we no longer need,\u201d Estevez said. He added that coordination can be improved \u2013 and said there is no existing process to follow up on how equipment is used.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Republicans and Democrats in Congress have finally found something they agree on \u2013 att", "title": "40 Percent of \u201cUsed\u201d Military Equipment Given to Police Is Brand New", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/09/10/40-Percent-Used-Military-Equipment-Given-Police-Brand-New", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/08202014_Ferguson_Police.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/09/10/40-Percent-Used-Military-Equipment-Given-Police-Brand-New", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/08202014_Ferguson_Police.jpg", "creator": "@Briannaehley", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Republicans and Democrats in Congress have finally found something they agree on \u2013 att", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "The problem, according to lawmakers, is that some of these small-town police officers may not be trained to handle the military equipment.\nHe added that coordination can be improved \u2013 and said there is no existing process to follow up on how equipment is used.\nIn 2013 alone, more than $449 million in military equipment was transferred; the Department of Homeland Security, the Justice Department and FEMA paid for it through grants appropriated by Congress.\nEstevez said N.J. police officers, for example, used Humvees to rescue Hurricane Sandy victims who were in water too high for police vehicles to reach; he also said military equipment was used after the Boston bombings to capture Dzhokhar Anzorovich \u201cJahar\u201d Tsarnaev.\nStill, nearly all of the officials agreed that oversight of the 1033 program as well as the grants needs to be improved."}
