Republican lawmakers and candidates often averted their gaze when questions were raised about President Obama\u2019s birth certificate and religion. They tolerated breaches of decorum, such as Representative Joe Wilson\u2019s cry of \u201cYou lie\u201d during a presidential address, and even made light of the man who brought many of those alleged conspiracies to the fore: Mr. Trump.\n\n\u201cThe party repeatedly made myopic decisions, tolerating the intolerable views of a segment of the party unwilling to accept that problem-solving is complicated,\u201d said Tony Fratto, a Republican consultant who served in the George W. Bush administration. \u201cThe short game was winning some midterms. The cost was creating an incoherent and unsustainable coalition.\u201d\n\nDemocrats are now seizing on this trajectory, and trying to tie all Republican incumbents to the legacy. \u201cDonald Trump is appealing to some of the darkest forces in America,\u201d Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the Democratic leader, said on Wednesday. \u201cIt\u2019s time for Republicans to stop the Frankenstein they created.\u201d\n\nVideo\n\nMany Republicans reject that analysis, especially when it comes to Mr. Ryan. His aides answer questions of Mr. Obama\u2019s birth with a letter that includes a copy of the president\u2019s birth certificate. \u201cI certainly understand the importance of this issue,\u201d the letter says, \u201cand I hope you find the information useful.\u201d\n\nInstead, they pin Mr. Trump\u2019s rise on their own failures to deliver on promises like the repeal of the Affordable Care Act, the defunding of Planned Parenthood, and the broad shrinking of government. That helped spawn the anger propelling Mr. Trump.\n\n\u201cPeople were not totally upfront in saying as long as President Obama is in the White House, we need to be realistic about our goals,\u201d said Brian Walsh, a former official at the National Republican Senatorial Committee.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhile Mr. Ryan politely rejected the birth inquiries, others did not. Asked in 2011 on the NBC program \u201cMeet the Press\u201d about the birth certificate conspiracy, and House members still promoting it, Mr. Boehner responded, \u201cIt really is not our job to tell the American people what to believe and what to think.\u201d Asked on the same program about such \u201ccrazy talk,\u201d Mr. Cantor replied, \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s, it\u2019s nice to call anyone crazy, O.K.?\u201d\n\nThe Tea Party movement initially was focused on government spending, health care and bailout programs, but in 2014, with the deficit falling and the economy improving, the movement turned to immigration \u2014 and a fierce opposition to an immigration law overhaul embraced by some Republicans, including Senator Marco Rubio of Florida and Mr. Ryan.\n\nThat June, Mr. Ryan and Representative Mario Diaz-Balart, Republican of Florida, were trying to drum up votes for an immigration bill that included a path to legal status for undocumented immigrants. Then Mr. Cantor, the majority leader, lost to a Tea Party primary challenger who accused him of being weak on illegal immigrants. Supporters abandoned the effort, and the immigration overhaul died.\n\nBy then, Mr. Obama had produced his so-called long-form birth certificate, publicly mocking Mr. Trump for his fixation. But in the anti-immigration movement, Mr. Trump found his new cause. His racially charged statements that Mexican illegal immigrants were possibly rapists and drug-runners meshed with statements by Representative Steve King of Iowa, that undocumented Mexican immigrants have \u201ccalves the size of cantaloupes because they\u2019re hauling 75 pounds of marijuana.\u201d And they elevated the views on immigration Mr. Ryan was trying to defeat.\n\nIn the Republican-controlled House now, there are frequent flare-ups over racially charged issues, from a movement among some conservatives to roll back voting rights, to a fight over confederate flags at federal cemeteries that shut down the appropriations process last summer.\n\nOn Tuesday, nine House Republicans voted against renaming a post office in Winston-Salem, N.C., after the poet Maya Angelou. Representative Mo Brooks of Alabama, a leader of anti-immigration forces, called her a \u201ccommunist sympathizer.\u201d\n\n\u201cEveryday we see manifestations of it,\u201d said Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, in an interview. \u201cRefusing to take down the Confederate flag, refusing to pass a Voting Rights Act, the list goes on and on. Republicans reject that. But they have flirted with Mr. Trump and his views for years. In 2012, Mitt Romney stood smiling as Mr. Trump expressed his \u201chonor and privilege\u201d to endorse his candidacy for the Republican presidential nomination.\n\nMr. Romney hailed Mr. Trump\u2019s \u201cextraordinary ability to understand how our economy works.\u201d\n\nStuart Stevens, a Romney campaign strategist, sees nothing wrong with that. \u201cWe don\u2019t shun people and Donald Trump wasn\u2019t shunned,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen he said crazy things people said they were crazy.\u201d But he has been a Trump critic this year.\n\nFor now Republicans dismiss that Mr. Trump can lay much of a glove on Mr. Ryan. \u201cI\u2019m not sure how much weight Trump\u2019s threat carries,\u201d said Senator Jeff Flake, Republican of Arizona and a critic of Mr. Trump. \u201cCertainly not more than Ryan can bench.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20160302174430, "twitter": {"description": "The House Republican leadership\u2019s coalition with divisive elements in
