Osborn\u2019s quarterly take marks his best quarter to date and brings his total to $1.6 million, with $715,000 in cash on hand. Official reports will be filed with the Federal Election Commission on April 15.\n\nOn Monday, the Osborn campaign released its fundraising figures before the deadline for the quarter had passed at midnight, leading some of Sasse\u2019s people to accuse them on social media of being desperate to change the headlines after Tea Party group FreedomWorks flipped its endorsement Friday from Osborn to Sasse.\n\nSenior Sasse adviser Jordan Gehrke mocked the Osborn campaign on Twitter, saying he enjoyed watching them \u201ctry to change the subject\u201d from the FreedomWorks turnaround by releasing numbers early.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re in real trouble,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThey needed to get SOMETHING positive out as quick as possible. They\u2019re in free fall.\u201d\n\nThe Osborn campaign said its haul included nearly 3,800 individual donations \u2014 1,400 from Nebraskans \u2014 and was \u201cfurther confirmation of the growing grassroots energy the Osborn campaign is seeing throughout Nebraska.\u201d In a news release, Osborn said, voters are identifying with his message of \u201cfighting Washington, D.C.\u201d \u2014 even though he is increasingly viewed as the GOP establishment candidate.\n\n\u201cI have a proven record of conservatism, versus Ben Sasse, who has championed big government policies while working as a bureaucrat in the nation\u2019s capital,\u201d Osborn said in the release. \u201cThe contrast could not be clearer.\u201d\n\nOsborn has been the presumed frontrunner in the GOP primary race, but his lead is believed to have eroded given his attacks on Sasse (see above) and a rough past few weeks. In late March, the Omaha World-Herald published a story challenging Osborn\u2019s portrayal of himself as a Navy hero after his surveillance plane was nearly knocked out of the sky by a Chinese fighter in 2001.\n\nOsborn saved the lives of the 23 crew members on board by landing the plane on a Chinese military base, where they were held captive for two weeks before being released to international headlines. He recently apologized for defending his decision to land the plane rather than ditch it to preserve intelligence by circulating an official-looking Navy memo supporting his actions, even though it hadn\u2019t been vetted by the Navy but was written by a Pentagon friend.\n\nMeanwhile, Sasse has enjoyed a surge of donations and high-profile endorsements from people like Congressman Jeff Fortenberry, Utah Sen. Mike Lee and brassy Republican Sarah Palin.\n\nSasse\u2019s campaign manager, Tyler Grassmeyer, says Sasse has the momentum, with thousands of Nebraskans having turned out for the Obamacare town hall meetings he\u2019s held across the state.\n\n\u201cBen\u2019s message of repealing Obamacare and recovering the Constitution is resonating with Nebraskans and that\u2019s where our support comes from,\u201d Grassmeyer said in a news release.\n\nSasse and Osborn are in the final weeks of a primary race with Omaha banker Sid Dinsdale and Omaha attorney Bart McLeay \u2014 who have not released their fundraising numbers. The winner of the May 13 primary takes on Democrat Dave Domina in November.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: An earlier version of this story said Osborn raised $550,000, but the campaign has since reported that the number has increased to $610,000.\n\n\n\nContact Deena Winter at deena@nebraskawatchdog.org.
