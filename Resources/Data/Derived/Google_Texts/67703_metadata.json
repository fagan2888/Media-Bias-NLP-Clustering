These \u201cquasi-public\u201d employees can no longer work under the standard \u201cfair share\u201d model of union representation; under that model, all employees are required to pay a \u201cfair share\u201d for union representation, and the union has a corresponding duty to represent (and benefit) all of the workers, whether they themselves voted for the union or not. Following the Court\u2019s decision in Harris v. Quinn, this enormous group of workers is being shifted to a \u201cright to work\u201d model. The union retains its duty of representing every worker in the bargaining unit; however, no worker has to pay her \u201cfair share\u201d for that representation, regardless of how much they benefit. Ad Policy\n\nThe onerous rules laid out in Harris mean that labor unions face a rocky road ahead. However, workers and unions may have also won an important victory in a case that on its face had nothing to do with them. In McCullen v. Coakley, the Roberts Court once again expanded its vision of the First Amendment, striking down a Massachusetts law that protected women seeking abortions by requiring buffer zones around the clinic where protesters could not stand, usually for the purpose of \u201ccounseling\u201d and intimidating women.\n\nThe rights of anti-abortion activists may seem worlds apart from the rights of workers, but the McCullen decision signaled another expansion of First Amendment rights that could benefit workers. Most people would likely be surprised to learn that if they wished to engage in a strike, picket, or boycott in their capacity as a worker, the law places severe restrictions on their conduct. For example, many public workers can face injunctions, fines, or even criminal charges for striking their employer. Private sector workers face similar penalties for certain types of pickets or boycotts against their employer or companies that do business with their employer. In 1984, labor law scholar James Gray Pope described the odd exclusion of labor from general First Amendment jurisprudence: \u201cOn the ladder of First Amendment values,\u201d Pope explained, \u201cpolitical speech occupies the top rung, commercial speech rests on the rung below, and labor speech is relegated to a \u2018black hole\u2019 beneath the ladder.\u201d The Roberts Court has done much to raise commercial speech out of its second-class status, but workers\u2019 labor speech rights still remain in Pope\u2019s \u201cblack hole.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.thumb": "http://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/fast_food_strikes_ap_img_2-275x173.jpg", "sailthru.author": "Moshe Z.
