For her first film as a director, she turned the camera on her own family.\n\nStarting in 2009, she began filming her grandmother Mimi, then 92, who had cared for Sartain\u2019s aunt, Dona, for decades. Dona has an intellectual disability and \u201cperhaps some undiagnosed autism,\u201d Sartain says. From there the film Mimi and Dona was born. It was released earlier this week on PBS\u2019 Independent Lens.\n\nSartain\u2019s grandmother was a \u201cwonderful moving presence\u201d who selflessly devoted herself to caring for her daughter. \u201cCould I be like that?\u201d Sartain wondered. \u201cI\u2019m not that good, I\u2019m not that unselfish. How could I measure up to Mimi?\u201d\n\nBut soon she would discover how her own path would overlap with that of her grandmother. \u201cIt was during filming that I started to fear my own son might have autism,\u201d Sartain says. \u201cAnd I wondered if I was just beginning a journey that Mimi had just ended.\u201d\n\nHer son Ben was diagnosed with autism. Sartain says she saw how her grandmother could be a role model for her and created this second, shorter, documentary, Sophie and Ben.\n\nMimi and Dona is streaming online through Dec. 23, 2015.\n\nYou can learn more about the film and filmmaker Sophie Sartain by visiting Independent Lens.", "article_metadata": {"description": "As Sophie Sartain was producing a film about her 92-year-old grandmother's devotion to her aunt with an intellectual disability, her own son was diagnosed with", "contextly-page": "{\"title\":\"Sophie and Ben: A Story of Filmmaker and Son with Autism (Video)\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/2015\\/11\\/25\\/sophie-and-ben-a-story-of-filmmaker-and-son-with-autism-video\\/\",\"pub_date\":\"2015-11-25 10:56:50\",\"mod_date\":\"2015-11-25 11:45:52\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":113500,\"author_id\":\"240\",\"author_name\":\"Lisa Aliferis\",\"author_display_name\":\"Lisa Aliferis\",\"tags\":[\"Arts\",\"Autism\",\"News\"],\"categories\":[\"Living Healthy\"],\"image\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/sites\\/27\\/2015\\/11\\/Screen-Shot-2015-11-25-at-10.37.48-AM.png\"}", "og": {"site_name": "State of Health", "description": "As Sophie Sartain was producing a film about her 92-year-old grandmother's devotion to her aunt with an intellectual disability, her own son was diagnosed with autism.", "title": "Sophie and Ben: A Story of Filmmaker and Son with Autism (Video)", "url": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/2015/11/25/sophie-and-ben-a-story-of-filmmaker-and-son-with-autism-video/", "image": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/wp-content/uploads/sites/27/2015/11/Screen-Shot-2015-11-25-at-10.37.48-AM-1440x797.png", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@kqedhealth", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@"}, "fb": {"app_id": 160023622793}, "keywords": "arts,autism,news", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Sophie and Ben: A Story of Filmmaker and Son with Autism (Video)Sophie Sartain had long worked in documentary filmmaking as a writer and editor.\n\u201cIt was during filming that I started to fear my own son might have autism,\u201d Sartain says.\nYou can learn more about the film and filmmaker Sophie Sartain by visiting Independent Lens.\n\u201cAnd I wondered if I was just beginning a journey that Mimi had just ended.\u201dHer son Ben was diagnosed with autism.\nStarting in 2009, she began filming her grandmother Mimi, then 92, who had cared for Sartain\u2019s aunt, Dona, for decades."}
