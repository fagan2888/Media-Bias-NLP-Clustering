Eric Decker didn’t make excuses. He didn’t hide from the media because he dropped a couple of passes.

The Broncos’ fourth-year receiver, who had 85 catches last season, admitted disappointment in his latest personal performance.

“Greatly,” he said at his locker Monday. “The TD and the one across the middle — just ridiculous. Painful.”

By TD, Decker was referring to a potential touchdown pass he dropped from Peyton Manning near the left corner of the end zone in the third quarter of the Broncos’ 49-27 victory Thursday night against Baltimore. Nothing hurt there, for on the next play Manning hit Wes Welker for a 2-yard touchdown pass.

There also was a skinny slant drop by Decker late in the third quarter that would have given the Broncos a first down.

“For me, it’s more about focus than anything, attention to detail,” Decker said. “All of that will carry over to the game.”

Champ, Dreessen remain out. Another day of practice, another practice without cornerback Champ Bailey or tight end Joel Dreessen participating. Both missed the Broncos’ opening game. Bailey is healing from a left foot sprain. Dreessen, who is returning from a knee arthroscope, went through agility drills on the side along with rookie running back C.J. Anderson, who is coming back from an medial collateral ligament sprain.

Also missing practice Monday with various ailments were middle linebacker Wesley Woodyard, returner Trindon Holliday and special-teamer Omar Bolden.

McGahee and Giants? There’s a chance the Broncos will take on running back Willis McGahee when they meet the New York Giants on Sunday at MetLife Stadium. McGahee was the Broncos’ leading rusher the past two years but was released in June. The Giants are holding a tryout Tuesday for veteran backs Brandon Jacobs, Joe McKnight and McGahee.
