Ted Cruz says his \u201cfight against Obamacare must continue,\u201d and so must our fact-checking of claims about the law.\n\nCruz distorted the impact of the Affordable Care Act on two vulnerable populations \u2014 the elderly and special needs children:\n\nCruz said seniors \u201cright now\u201d are being notified that they are \u201closing their health insurance\u201d during the enrollment period that began Oct. 15. In fact, the number of seniors enrolled in the Medicare Advantage plans to which he\u2019s referring has increased 30 percent since the law took effect in 2010 \u2014 and enrollment is expected to increase again next year.\n\nHe also claimed seniors \u201care facing higher prescription drug costs\u201d next year. In fact, seniors to date have received $7 billion in rebates and prescription discounts under the Affordable Care Act, and the average senior will have the choice of more prescription drug plans for 2014.\n\nCruz said \u201cfamilies of special needs children will face a new penalty for using savings\u201d to pay for medical expenses. He\u2019s referring to a $2,500 cap on pre-tax contributions to flexible spending accounts. Actually, advocates for special needs children say that provision hasn\u2019t had much of an impact, and other provisions of the new law \u201cgreatly benefit people with disabilities.\u201d\n\nMedicare Advantage On Oct. 16, when Senate leaders announced a bipartisan deal that would end the partial government shutdown, Cruz held a media availability and issued a press release to say he opposed \u2014 but would not block \u2014 the agreement. He said he would oppose the Senate compromise because it does nothing to help \u201cthe millions of Americans who are being harmed by Obamacare,\u201d singling out some of the nation\u2019s most vulnerable populations. Here\u2019s what he said about the Senate bill in a press availability with reporters on Capitol Hill (at about the 48 second mark):\n\nCruz, Oct. 16: And it provides no relief to all the seniors, to all the people with disabilities who are right now getting in-the-mail notifications from their health insurance companies that they\u2019re losing their health insurance because of Obamacare.\n\nAnd this is what he said in a written statement issued that same day:\n\nCruz, Oct. 16: As a result of Obamacare, families of special needs children will face a new penalty for using savings to pay for medical therapies and health-related expenses. That\u2019s not part of the discussion. Seniors who are facing higher prescription drug costs as a result of this law won\u2019t be given any consideration, either.\n\nWe asked the senator\u2019s office for information on the statements he made about the impact of the law on seniors and special needs children. Let\u2019s start with senior citizens, beginning with the claim that seniors are \u201closing their health insurance.\u201d\n\nThe senator\u2019s office referred us to a recent analysis by the consulting company Avalere of Medicare Advantage plans that will be available to seniors for 2014. The consulting firm\u2019s report found that the number of plans available to seniors in 2014 would \u201cdip modestly\u201d from 2,664 to 2,522, a decline of 5.3 percent. The open enrollment period began on Oct. 15 and ends Dec. 7, so Cruz is no doubt right that some seniors have been told that their insurance plan is no longer part of the Medicare Advantage program.\n\nHowever, a drop in the number of plans does not mean a drop in the number of persons covered.\n\nIn fact, the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation reports that the number of persons enrolled in MA plans rose by nearly 10 percent this year, compared with 2012. A total of 14.4 million persons now are covered by MA plans, more than ever before.\n\nThe Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services says that trend will continue. In a Sept. 19 press release, the CMS said \u201cfor the fourth straight year enrollment is projected to increase\u201d in 2014. CMS spokesman Raymond Thorn told us in an email that enrollment \u201cis projected to grow to 14.995 million in 2014,\u201d an increase of 4.7 percent over this year.\n\nThis is exactly contrary to the predictions at the time of the law\u2019s enactment. KFF notes: \u201cSince 2010, enrollment in Medicare Advantage plans has grown by 30 percent in spite of concerns that the payment changes enacted in the 2010 Affordable Care Act would lead to significant reductions in enrollment.\u201d\n\nIn fact, as Affordable Care Act critic Alyene Senger of the conservative Heritage Foundation wrote recently, \u201cIt is not yet known how MA plans will react to Obamacare\u2019s significant reductions or how beneficiaries will respond to any changes made by MA plans.\u201d But that hasn\u2019t stopped Cruz from saying seniors are losing coverage. His office even cites Senger\u2019s article as supporting that claim, perhaps hoping that we would not actually read it.\n\nAllyson Funk, a spokeswoman for the AARP, did not express concern about the slight dip in MA plans. She said there \u201cwill remain broad penetration and availability of MA plans\u201d in 2014. Funk also noted that Medicare Advantage premiums have gone down, \u201cwhile quality has improved,\u201d since the passage of the Affordable Care Act. CMS says the average premiums for Medicare Advantage plans are down by 9.8 percent since the health care legislation became law.\n\nDisabled Seniors\n\nIn his criticism of the law\u2019s impact on seniors, Cruz also made reference to seniors with disabilities when he expressed concern about \u201call the people with disabilities\u201d who \u201cright now\u201d are \u201closing their health insurance.\u201d\n\nThis time, the senator\u2019s office referred us to a Sept. 16 opinion piece written by Scott Gottlieb of the conservative American Enterprise Institute about 9 million low-income people who are eligible for both Medicaid and Medicare. Gottlieb wrote that many of these people \u201cwill be forcibly moved into Medicaid HMOs once another long-delayed element of the bill starts to get implemented this fall.\u201d\n\nBut they are not \u201closing\u201d coverage \u201cright now\u201d \u2014 in fact, most of the 9 million will be unaffected now and for at least three years.\n\nHere\u2019s what\u2019s happening: In April, CMS announced that it would provide funding and technical assistance to 15 states to develop demonstration programs designed to provide better, more cost-effective services to low-income people (elderly and non-elderly) who are eligible for both Medicaid and Medicare. In a recent report, KFF says the demonstration project is limited to no more than 2 million dual-eligible beneficiaries, and, so far, CMS has approved specific plans in eight states covering 1.1 million beneficiaries.\n\nThe demonstration programs, which will last for three years, target both the elderly and non-elderly. In fact, Massachusetts\u2019 program will include only non-elderly, dual-eligible beneficiaries, according to KFF\u2019s report. Five of the eight states (and the county of Los Angeles) will seek volunteers for the demonstration programs before automatically assigning beneficiaries to managed care plans. In one state, Minnesota, the demonstration program will be strictly voluntary. Six states will allow beneficiaries assigned to HMOs to opt-out.\n\nAccording to CMS: \u201c[I]n each Demonstration beneficiaries will receive all the current services and benefits they receive today from Medicare and Medicaid with added care coordination, protections and access to enhanced services.\u201d\n\nIn other words, the coverage they are getting is supposed to be better than the coverage Cruz says they are \u201closing.\u201d Whether it works out that way or not, we can\u2019t say, and at this point neither can he.\n\n\u2018Higher Prescription Drug Costs\u2019?\n\nCruz also said that seniors \u201care facing higher prescription drug costs,\u201d and his office again referred us to the Avalere analysis.\n\nIn addition to its analysis of Medicare Advantage, Avalere also reviewed the costs of Medicare Part D standalone Prescription Drug Plans (PDPs) for the 2014 coverage plans that seniors are now signing up to join. The analysis concluded: \u201cOn average, PDP premiums will increase by 5.1 percent overall.\u201d\n\nThe Kaiser Family Foundation, in its own analysis, says that the average increase for these plans will be a little less than 5 percent \u2014 from $38.14 per month to $39.90 \u2014 \u201cunless many new or current enrollees select lower-priced plans.\u201d That is entirely possible. KFF notes that Medicare beneficiaries in 2014 \u201cwill have a choice of 35 stand-alone PDPs, on average, up by four from 2013.\u201d\n\nKFF also illustrates in Exhibit 3 of its report that average premium increases are nothing new for Medicare Part D standalone plans. Since 2006, the average premium has gone up about 54 percent \u2014 including a high growth rate of 17 percent in 2009, which was before the Affordable Care Act took effect. The only year the average premium did not go up was in 2012, when the law was in effect.\n\nBut seniors \u2014 and about two out of three seniors are in standalone prescription drug plans \u2014 should be warned that averages are just that. What any individual will pay will vary \u2014 sometimes greatly \u2014 as KFF\u2019s study points out.\n\nKFF says: \u201cEnrollees in two of the most popular PDPs will experience 50-percent premium increases if they stay in the same plans in 2014, while enrollees in three other popular PDPs will see lower premiums.\u201d Exhibit 4 provides this breakdown: Forty-four percent will see an increase of $1 to $10 per month, and 14 percent will see an increase of more than $10 per month. Thirty-one percent will see a decrease of $1 to $10 per month, and 4 percent will see a decrease of more than $10. About 7 percent will see a minimal change.\n\nAs is the case with most insurance coverage, the actual change in premiums will depend upon an individual\u2019s personal situation and the decisions that he or she makes.\n\n\u201cWe encourage our members to carefully evaluate their Part D plan options each open enrollment period by comparison shopping,\u201d the AARP\u2019s Funk said.\n\nIt\u2019s also true that premiums are just one component of the prescription drug insurance coverage.\n\nKFF notes that a little more than half of the PDPs \u2014 about 53 percent \u2014 require a deductible. For those that do, the deductible will fall next year from $325 to $310 \u2014 a $15 savings that would help offset the average premium increase for some seniors.\n\nAlso, the Affordable Care Act has provided 6.6 million seniors with $7 billion in rebates and discounts on prescription drugs to help them pay for costs that fall into a gap in coverage known as the \u201cdoughnut hole.\u201d In 2014, the plans will pay most drug costs (minus a deductible and co-pays) up to a certain level (after a beneficiary incurs $2,850 in total costs). But then beneficiaries will have to pay all of their prescription costs until they reach a \u201ccatastrophic level\u201d of $4,550 out-of-pocket expenses \u201c(or $6,691 in total drug costs under the standard benefit),\u201d KFF says in its report. About 82 percent of PDPs offer no or very limited gap coverage, the report says.\n\nHowever, the Affordable Care Act provided a one-time $250 rebate to seniors who have Medicare Part D drug coverage in 2010 to help cover some of the costs of the doughnut hole. In addition, the law provides discounts each year and eventually (by 2020) phases out the doughnut hole entirely. In 2014, for example, that means that seniors who reach the coverage gap will receive a 50 percent discount on brand-name drugs and the insurance plan will pay 2.5 percent of the cost, leaving seniors to pay 47.5 percent during that gap period.\n\nSpecial Needs Children\n\nCruz also said \u201cfamilies of special needs children will face a new penalty for using savings to pay for medical therapies and health-related expenses.\u201d Some may, but advocates for these families say Cruz overstates the impact and ignores the benefits these families will receive from the Affordable Care Act.\n\nCruz\u2019s office told us the senator was referring to the $2,500 cap the new law places on annual contributions to Flexible Spending Arrangements (FSAs). These accounts allow an estimated 33 million Americans to contribute pre-tax dollars from their pay checks for future medical expenses. Until January of this year, the IRS did not limit how much employees could contribute \u2014 although employers could.\n\nThe senator\u2019s office referred us to a Sept. 25 blog post on the website of Americans for Tax Reform, a conservative group that is opposed to the law. ATR says the cap \u201cwill be particularly cruel and onerous\u201d on special needs children, because these families use the accounts not only for medical expenses but also to pay tuition for special needs education.\n\nThis is not the first time that Republicans have cited the cap as being particularly onerous for special needs families who use FSAs for education costs. The Republican National Committee has claimed that the cap will result in a \u201c$13 billion tax increase on families with special needs.\u201d The RNC also says special needs families use these accounts \u201cto pay for fees at special needs schools, transportation costs associated with their child\u2019s education, Braille books, and guide dogs for the visually impaired.\u201d\n\nIt is simply not true that the special needs families will have to pay $13 billion in additional taxes. That\u2019s the total amount that the cap is expected to generate in new revenues over a 10-year period, according to the Joint Committee on Taxation. It isn\u2019t known how much of that would be paid by the families of special needs children, but the ARC \u2014 one of the nation\u2019s leading advocates for children with developmental disabilities \u2014 tells us that it hasn\u2019t seen any evidence of the cap having much of an impact on families with special needs children.\n\n\u201cWe do not know how many people may be using FSAs to pay for private school tuition or other expenses \u2014 we have tried to research it but found no information,\u201d the ARC said in a statement provided to us by spokeswoman Kristen McKiernan. \u201cWe know it can be expensive to have a special needs child but we have not seen any evidence that the ACA change [on FSAs] is very impactful.\u201d\n\nWendy Fournier, president of the National Autism Association, said her organization hasn\u2019t fielded any questions or complaints about the cap on FSAs for either tuition payments or medical expenses. \u201cWe haven\u2019t had any of our members say it is an issue for them,\u201d she said. It may be an issue for some, but she\u2019s not heard that it is. \u201cThis is the first I heard of it,\u201d she said.\n\nThe ARC statement noted that the IRS still allows special needs families to deduct medical expenses and health-related expenses, including for special education. IRS rules say such families can deduct certain educational expenses for \u201cchildren who have learning disabilities caused by mental or physical impairments,\u201d including tuition, meals and lodging. The deduction, of course, does not provide the same benefits as pre-tax contributions to an FSA.\n\nThe ARC and the United Cerebral Palsy websites say the Affordable Care Act \u201ccontains numerous provisions that greatly benefit people with disabilities.\u201d\n\nThe ARC and the United Cerebral Palsy: The most important changes that the ACA will bring about are: Prohibiting pre-existing condition exclusions; Eliminating annual and lifetime caps; Prohibiting discrimination based on health status and disability (prevents insurers from dropping individuals when they get sick); Requiring insurers to issue and renew insurance to employers and individuals; Expanding Medicaid eligibility to cover individuals with incomes up to 133 percent of the federal poverty line (approximately $29,000 per year for a family of four); and making a number of improvements to the Medicaid program.\n\nThe ARC statement summed it up by saying, \u201cWe expect that the ACA will benefit people with disabilities because of the health insurance reforms.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Eugene Kiely, with Brooks Jackson\n\nAlso on HuffPost: Sen.
