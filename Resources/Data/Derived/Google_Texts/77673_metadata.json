Bernie Sanders use the beleaguered city as the backdrop for a nationally televised debate.\n\nThe Democratic candidates have made the emergency over lead-contaminated drinking water in the city of nearly 100,000 mostly poor and minority residents a cause celebre. The biggest concern is that an estimated 8,000 children under the age of six may have been exposed to lead in Flint\u2019s water during the past year \u2013 and possibly suffered brain impairment -- while city, state and federal officials put in charge of the municipal water system may have covered up the problem or been slow to respond.\n\nRelated: How the Flint Drinking Water Crisis Became a Political Punching Bag\n\nSanders, the socialist presidential candidate from Vermont, has called for Republican Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder to resign over Flint\u2019s lead-contaminated water supply. He called it \u201cone of the worst public health crises in the modern history of this country.\u201d\n\nBut for all the deserved attention Flint\u2019s struggling residents are receiving, the problem of high levels of lead in municipal drinking water is unfortunately an all too common occurrence.\n\nJust last Wednesday, Mississippi state authorities cautioned that pregnant women and young children in the city of Jackson \u2013 the state capital -- should refrain from drinking unfiltered tap water because of the high levels of lead that have been discovered.\n\nLead is a metal that can cause behavior problems and learning disabilities in infants and children. State health officials notified Jackson in January that 22 percent of water samples taken from homes last June had tested above dangerous levels. Some of the lead levers were as high as eight times the federal level of 15 parts per billion, according to the Associated Press. City officials blame the problem on old, unsafe plumbing in individual homes.\n\nRelated: Flint\u2019s Drinking Water Crisis Just Got More Toxic with Legionnaire\u2019s Disease\n\nTony Yarber, the mayor, and other city officials repeatedly sought to downplay comparisons between Jackson\u2019s problems and those of Flint, where the lead poisoning of the drinking water went undetected \u2013 or unacknowledged \u2013 for well over a year. \"We're not just like Flint,\" Sheila Byrd, a spokesperson for the mayor, told Mississippi reporters.\n\nIt should come as little surprise that many other cities are suffering similar problems in the face of the nation\u2019s aging infrastructure. While lawmakers and policy makers typically focus their attention on dilapidated highways, bridges and mass transit, the problem of aging and corroding water pipes and systems pose serious public health problems.\n\nFlint residents first began complaining in April 2014 after the emergency financial manager appointed by Gov. Snyder ordered a switch from Lake Huron to the Flint River as the source of the city\u2019s drinking water. When the highly acidic Flint River water wasn\u2019t properly treated, it corroded old underwater pipes that began leaching lead into the water system. By last March \u2013 with residents up in arms \u2013 the city government voted to switch back to the old source of water used by the city of Detroit, but by then it was too late.\n\nOther cities have had similar \u2013 albeit less dramatic -- problems with ancient pipes and storage systems that are prone to mishaps or calamities.\n\nRelated: Michigan governor to request federal aid in Flint water crisis\n\nFor example, routine laboratory tests last August in Sebring, Ohio, turned up unsafe levels of lead in the town\u2019s drinking water after workers stopped adding a chemical to keep lead water pipes from corroding, according to The New York Times. It took five months before city officials warned pregnant women and children not to drink the water and to shut down taps and drinking fountains in the schools.\n\nA similar problem with lead arose in 2001 in Washington, D.C., the nation\u2019s capital, after public works officials changed how they disinfected drinking water. The levels of lead in the tap water of thousands of homes shot up by as much as 20 times the federally approved level. Yet many residents didn\u2019t find out about this problem for three years.\n\nThere have been other examples of this over the past decade. It took more than three years before testing in 2014 finally confirmed that drinking water in Brick Township, N.J., an ocean side community of 75,000, contained excess lead levels in many homes.\n\nThe Times reported that despite these and other problems, federal officials and many scientists agree that the majority of the country\u2019s 53,000 community water systems provide safe drinking water. But episodes likes those in Sebring and Washington \u201care unsettling reminders of what experts say are holes in the safety net of rules and procedures intended to keep water not just lead-free, but free of all poisons,\u201d the newspaper reported.\n\nRelated: Federal officials probe lead-tainted water in Flint, Michigan\n\nOne of the more glaring loopholes is an EPA lead regulation that requires water systems to test in only a small number of homes with lead pipes \u2013 usually 50 to 100 for larger systems. Sometimes the intervals between testing can stretch by as much as three years. By then, many residents could have consumed unhealthy lead levels.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Many eyes will be on the drinking water crisis in Flint, Mich., next weekend when Demo", "title": "Flint Is One of Many Lead-Polluted Water Systems in the US", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/02/28/Flint-One-Many-Lead-Polluted-Water-Systems-US", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/flint-water-top.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/02/28/Flint-One-Many-Lead-Polluted-Water-Systems-US", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/flint-water-top.jpg", "creator": "@ericpianin", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Many eyes will be on the drinking water crisis in Flint, Mich., next weekend when Demo", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Related: How the Flint Drinking Water Crisis Became a Political Punching BagSanders, the socialist presidential candidate from Vermont, has called for Republican Michigan Gov.\nThe Times reported that despite these and other problems, federal officials and many scientists agree that the majority of the country\u2019s 53,000 community water systems provide safe drinking water.\nRelated: Federal officials probe lead-tainted water in Flint, MichiganOne of the more glaring loopholes is an EPA lead regulation that requires water systems to test in only a small number of homes with lead pipes \u2013 usually 50 to 100 for larger systems.\nSnyder ordered a switch from Lake Huron to the Flint River as the source of the city\u2019s drinking water.\nWhen the highly acidic Flint River water wasn\u2019t properly treated, it corroded old underwater pipes that began leaching lead into the water system."}
