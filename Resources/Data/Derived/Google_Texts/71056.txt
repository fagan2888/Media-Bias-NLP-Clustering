Smoke from wildfires in other states is prompting a smoke health advisory on Thursday for northwest and west-central Colorado.

The Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment issued the alert to be in effect through 9 a.m. Friday.

The alert affects areas west of the Continental Divide, below 9,000 feet, including but not limited to, Grand Junction, Delta, Montrose, Rifle, Glenwood Springs, Eagle, Aspen, Gunnison, Hot Sulphur Springs, Walden, Steamboat Springs, Craig and Meeker.

The department recommends that residents, especially special populations such as the young, elderly, and those with heart or respiratory conditions, stay indoors if smoke becomes thick. If smoke has visibility at less than 5 miles in a neighborhood, smoke has reached unhealthy levels according to a news alert from the department.

Smoke levels are expected to decrease late Thursday afternoon, but will increase again Thursday night and Friday morning.
