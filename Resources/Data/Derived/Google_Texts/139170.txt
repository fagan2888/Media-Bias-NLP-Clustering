Montana’s newest United States Senator, John Walsh, is starting his second month in office.

The former Lieutenant Governor and head of the Montana National Guard was appointed by Governor Steve Bullock to fill the seat vacated by long-time Senator Max Baucus. Baucus is now the U.S. Ambassador to China.

Walsh was already running for the Senate Seat when appointed. Bullock’s move to appoint him has been seen as an attempt to give Walsh a political edge in this November’s election against likely Republican challenger, Congressman Steve Daines.

Senator Walsh is currently on a tour of several Montana cities and took the time to stop by our studios in Missoula. In this feature interview, Walsh speaks with Capitol Reporter Dan Boyce about his more than 30-year career in the Montana National Guard, his priorities in his new office, and the perception his appointment was crafted by Washington D.C. insiders.
