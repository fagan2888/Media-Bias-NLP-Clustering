The company raised the lower end of its 2014 earnings forecast range.\n\nHospitals are benefiting from the extension of insurance coverage to more Americans under the Affordable Care Act, even as the government looks to curb Medicare and Medicaid spending.\n\nTenet and Community Health, the No. 2 U.S. hospital chain, both made sizable acquisitions to position themselves for the changes, with Tenet buying Vanguard Health Systems last year and Community completing the purchase of Health Management Associates earlier this year.\n\nDallas-based Tenet said third-quarter adjusted admissions, which include both inpatient and outpatient figures, at its facilities operated for at least one year jumped 4.9 percent from the same period a year ago.\n\nFranklin, Tennessee-based Community Health said its adjusted admissions were flat in the third quarter compared with a year ago, an improvement from the first and second quarters when admissions declined.\n\n\"The broader trend of improving utilization is pretty evident,\" said Jefferies analyst Brian Tanquilut.\n\nTenet posted a lower third-quarter net profit due to substantially higher interest expense related to its Vanguard acquisition. Net profit fell to $9 million, or 9 cents a share, from $28 million, or 27 cents a share, a year ago.\n\nEarnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization, and excluding special items, climbed 59 percent to $459 million from a year ago.\n\nTenet also raised the lower end of the range of its forecast for full-year adjusted EBITDA, and is now predicting a profit of $1.90 billion to $1.95 billion.\n\nCommunity Health trimmed the top end of its 2014 adjusted EBITDA projection, forecasting a range of $2.83 billion to $2.9 billion, compared with its previous forecast of $2.83 billion to $2.98 billion.\n\nCommunity Health said third-quarter net profit rose to $62 million, or 54 cents per share, from $4 million, or 4 cents per share, a year earlier, when earnings were reduced by expenses stemming from a Department of Justice investigation into short-stay admissions at its hospitals.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA increased 73 percent to $663 million in the latest third quarter, compared with a year ago.\n\nCommunity Health also said Monday it had reached an agreement in principle and is setting aside a reserve of $75 million to settle a separate DOJ probe into whether its three New Mexico hospitals improperly submitted claims for federal funds through the state\u2019s Medicaid programs.\n\n(Reporting by Susan Kelly in Chicago and Vidya L Nathan in Bangalore;
