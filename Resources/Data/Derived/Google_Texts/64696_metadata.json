This time the 5-year-old was ridden by Victor Espinoza, who was aboard American Pharoah for last year\u2019s Triple Crown sweep.\n\n\u201cToday proves how he can run when he\u2019s 100 percent,\u201d Espinoza said. \u201cHe felt strong during the prep. He won easy.\u201d\n\nThe race, however, was not without problems. California Chrome\u2019s saddle slipped way down his back near the end. But by then he was way in front.\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t that concerned,\u201d Espinoza said. \u201cI just kept looking forward and thinking, \u2018Where\u2019s the wire?\u2019 It was not coming fast enough.\u201d\n\nCalifornia Chrome, the 2014 horse of the year, won $6 million and now tops the earnings list after his third consecutive victory.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the dream of a lifetime for me. It doesn\u2019t get better,\u201d trainer Art Sherman said. \u201cThe Chromies (fans) will be going crazy (back home).\u201d\n\nThe winner covered the approximately 1\u00bc miles in 2:01.83. Mubtaahij of Ireland was second on the dirt track, followed by Hopportunity of the U.S. The 12-horse field also featured Frosted and Keen Ice, the only horse to beat American Pharoah. Frosted finished fifth, Keen Ice eighth.\n\nCalifornia Chrome, the favorite for the second consecutive year, started from an unfavorable No. 11 post position. But he was quickly in stride and stayed wide the whole time. He rode next to Msawish, which took the early lead under Frankie Dettori. California Chrome turned it on toward the wire.\n\n\u201cHe likes to be on the outside,\u201d Sherman said. \u201cI just told Victor to get him in a position to win. If you have to lose ground, so be it.\u201d\n\nRight now, California Chrome is gaining plenty of ground. After his terrific 2014 season, he didn\u2019t race for 10 months last year because of a bruised bone. He began his comeback at Santa Anita in January. That month he arrived in Dubai to get accustomed to conditions.\n\nSherman said California Chrome probably will be heading home after Dubai. Last year, he was taken to England.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll give him 30 days at the farm to let him unwind, and the ultimate goal is the Breeders\u2019 Cup (in November at Santa Anita in Southern California),\u201d he said.\n\nJapan\u2019s Real Steel was the winner of the Dubai Turf, a $6 million turf race Saturday.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "California Chrome good as gold in Dubai World Cup", "title": "California Chrome good as gold in Dubai World Cup", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/03/26/california-chrome-good-as-gold-in-dubai-world-cup/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "height": 630}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2016-03-26T18:02:32+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-03-26T18:02:32+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates \u2014 California Chrome was back at his best Saturday, racing to a 5-length victory in the $10 million Dubai World Cup.\nIf you have to lose ground, so be it.\u201dRight now, California Chrome is gaining plenty of ground.\nSherman said California Chrome probably will be heading home after Dubai.\nCalifornia Chrome turned it on toward the wire.\nCalifornia Chrome, the favorite for the second consecutive year, started from an unfavorable No."}
