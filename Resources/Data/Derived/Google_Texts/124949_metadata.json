The program opens to the general population in January.\n\nWith temperatures in the 70s Tuesday across Hall County, it seemed odd to see dozens of seniors waiting to apply for help paying their heating bills at the Legacy Link office in Oakwood.\n\nBut the forecasts for a cold, wet winter, spurred on by a strong El Ni\u00f1o, are a reminder of what\u2019s likely to come in January, February and March.\n\nMartha Hunter said her furnace went out last year during a cold spell. That memory was visceral as she shook at the thought.\n\nThe federally-funded Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program distributes money to local community action agencies to cover heating bills for those in need.\n\nThe program spent nearly $500,000 last winter to support about 1,500 Hall County households.\n\nAnd across the state, more than $55 million was spent on the program between November 2014 and April 2015 to assist about 163,000 Georgians.\n\nTo qualify, a family\u2019s annual income must be less than or equal to 60 percent of the median income for a family in Georgia.\n\nThat threshold is about $21,000 for an individual and close to $47,000 for a household of five.\n\nDepending on income and household size, qualified applicants like Hunter receive between $310 and $350 to pay their bills.\n\nFor the elderly, disabled and low-income, that money is nothing short of a lifeline.\n\nRD Martin, 73, lives on a fixed income like many of those who participate in the program.\n\nHe said this is the second year he has received financial support for his heating payments.\n\nThough fuel costs have dropped in the last year, these bills remain \u201ccostly\u201d to those living on Social Security and disability checks.\n\nAnd because Social Security recipients will not receive a cost-of-living raise next year, the energy assistance program becomes even more vital, participants said.\n\nHall County Community Resource Coordinator Shanna Cotton said she expects demand for assistance to be as high as ever over the next few months.\n\nRecent years have seen a new influx in the kinds of people looking for assistance, from more elderly and disabled to struggling working-class families.\n\nCotton said 150 seniors had been approved for assistance on Monday and she expected about 200 individuals to apply on Tuesday. She expected that same number each day for the rest of the week.\n\nThe program opens to the general public in January.\n\nCotton hopes the program will open earlier in coming years.\n\nIt was actually delayed from November to December this year, but Cotton said some households face the prospect of having their power cut off if assistance is continually delayed.\n\n\u201cAt least they\u2019re not waiting out in the cold today,\u201d she said.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.gainesvilletimes.com/archives/114096/", "image": "http://media.morristechnology.com/webmedia/upload/gainesville/article/2015/12/15/1216energy4.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "With temperatures in the 70s Tuesday across Hall County, it seemed odd to see dozens of seniors waiting to apply for help paying their heating bills at the Legacy Link office in Oakwood.", "title": "Seniors receive help through heating bill program"}, "twitter": {"site": "@gtimes", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noarchive", "title": "Seniors receive help through heating bill program"}, "article_summary": "And because Social Security recipients will not receive a cost-of-living raise next year, the energy assistance program becomes even more vital, participants said.\nThe federally-funded Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program distributes money to local community action agencies to cover heating bills for those in need.\nWith temperatures in the 70s Tuesday across Hall County, it seemed odd to see dozens of seniors waiting to apply for help paying their heating bills at the Legacy Link office in Oakwood.\nThe program spent nearly $500,000 last winter to support about 1,500 Hall County households.\nDepending on income and household size, qualified applicants like Hunter receive between $310 and $350 to pay their bills."}
