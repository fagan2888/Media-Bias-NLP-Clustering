A debate was held at Cal Poly Thursday night for the congressional candidates running to be the next representative of California's 24th district, which covers much of the Central Coast.

Four democrats, three republicans and two independents squared off in front of a full Spanos Theater.

The most heated exchange was between Republican Justin Fareed and Democrat William Ostrander over how the Affordable Care Act was passed into law.

FAREED: "That's an issue when Congress isn't doing their job."

OSTRANDER: "The republicans boycotted those committee hearings."

FAREED: "It never even went through mark up in the house."

OSTRANDER: "ok."

Democrat Jeff Oshins questioned whether any republican on stage would sign a pledge agreeing to no new tax increases, "that's why I'm asking republicans if they're going to sign the tax pledge."

While Fareed skirted the issue, State Assemblyman Katcho Achadjian and Matt Kokkonen agreed. "We need not to dig deeper into your pockets for more taxes," said Achadjian.

The only boo from the audience was for Kokkonen when he said, "We have the best medical care in the world." He got some cheers when he said the U.S. has some of the best doctors and hospitals.

Other questions centered around challenges to higher education: "it's ridiculous you can refinance your house and not your college loan," said Democratic Santa Barbara County Supervisor Salud Carbajal. "It begins with a debt free college education," said Independent John Uebersax.

They also covered drought solutions, "research is where government can help the most," said Independent Steve Isakson, and political divisiveness, "where even when you can disagree, you don't have to be disagreeable," Democratic Santa Barbara Mayor Helene Schneider said.

All are vying to replace Incumbent Democrat Lois Capps who announced after 18 years in office she will not seek re-election.
