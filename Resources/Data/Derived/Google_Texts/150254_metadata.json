The baker, Jack Phillips, owner of Masterpiece Cakeshop, has argued that providing that service would violate his Christian beliefs.\n\nIn another case, a Colorado man filed complaints against three bakeries that refused to make a Bible-themed cake with religious scripture. One of the bakers, Marjorie Silva, owner of Denver\u2019s Azucar Bakery, said she refused to make the cake because she considered the Bible scripture and images the man wanted to be hateful toward gays. Those cases are being reviewed by Colorado\u2019s Civil Rights Division.\n\nThe man who filed the complaints against the three bakers, Bill Jack of Castle Rock, said in written testimony read to lawmakers that Colorado\u2019s current anti-discrimination law \u201cabridges the right of free speech and artistic expression of all bakers, florists, photographers, and other business owners who are compelled to participate in activities that their creed instructs them violates their sincerely held beliefs and consciences.\u201d\n\nThe AP report isn't terrible. It attempts \u2014 it seems to me \u2014 to present both sides in a fair manner.\n\nBut here's why I'd characterize the AP story as \"too hot\": It focuses on the controversy, but the wording and details impress me as too imprecise.\n\nTerms such as \"punishments,\" \"discrimination\" and \"complaints\" are used in the lede. However, I'm not sure the story adequately explains what those words mean in this context.\n\nAP seems to boil down the proposals to such broad, general statements that the specific meaning may be lost. (I do feel for the reporter trying to put together such a complicated story on deadline and fit it within AP's word count restrictions.)", "article_metadata": {"description": "First off, my apologies to\u00a0Goldilocks and the Three Bears.\u00a0I hate to insert \r\nthem into\u00a0Colorado's same-sex wedding cake wars.\u00a0\r\n\r\nHowever, their involvement seems appropriate in this case, as I critique \r\nmedia coverage this week that ranges from\u00a0\"too hot\"\u00a0to\u00a0\"too cold\"\u00a0to\u00a0\"just \r\nright.\"\r\n\r\nLet's start with an Associated Press story headlined\u00a0\"The growing conflict \r\nbetween religious groups and gay rights advocates\":\r\n\r\n    DENVER\u00a0\u2014 The growing conflict between religious groups and gay-rights\r\n    advocates over punishments in discrimination cases is playing out in\r\n    Colorado, with a Democrat-led committing (sic) rejecting Republican\r\n    proposals aimed at protecting individuals and organizations from\r\n    complaints.\r\n\r\n    But what some conservatives view as trying to preserve religious\r\n    freedom, Democrats and gay-rights advocates see as potentially\r\n    sanctioning discrimination.\r\n\r\n    One proposal would have prohibited penalties in discrimination cases if\r\n    the punishment \u2014 such as an order to serve gay couples \u2014 violated the\r\n    beliefs of the accused.
