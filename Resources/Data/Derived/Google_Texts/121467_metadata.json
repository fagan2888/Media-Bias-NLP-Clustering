He's already moving to town and looks at his new job as an 8-year commitment to keep the organization improving.\n\nBuy Photo Kenneth Holmen discussed taking over as the new chief executive officer of CentraCare Monday, Oct. 27 at the St. Cloud Hospital. Holmen will begin his new position at the end of the year. (Photo: Jason Wachter, jwachter@stcloudtimes.com)Buy Photo Story Highlights Holmen, 62, graduated from the University of Minnesota Medical School in 1978.\n\nHe has been an anesthesiologist since 1983 and was CEO of his practice from 1996-2004.\n\nHolmen joined HealthPartners in 2004 and also became chief medical officer at Regions Hospital.\n\nHe has active privileges at Regions Hospital in St. Paul and St. Joseph's Hospital in Brainerd.\n\nDr. Kenneth Holmen does not start as CEO of CentraCare Health until Jan. 1, but his work in St. Cloud has begun.\n\nLast week, he met with hospital officials on Monday, attended a strategy retreat Tuesday and closed on a townhome on Thursday. He talks to outgoing President and CEO Terry Pladson at least every other week to get up to speed on leading Central Minnesota's largest employer.\n\nSince 2004, Holmen has been a vice president with Bloomington-based HealthPartners, which controls Regions Hospital in St. Paul, where he is chief medical officer. Soon he will move from being one of the top men at HealthPartners, which has annual revenue of $5 billion and 22,000 employees, to the top leader of CentraCare, with more than $1 billion in operating revenue and 8,000 employees.\n\nHe said the transition is a time to recognize how Pladson has led an expansion of several regional hospital acquisitions and, most recently, a $250 million expansion to St. Cloud Hospital.\n\n\"The transition also is important because I'm the new guy,\" said Holmen, a jovial man, about 6 feet tall, with a broad figure and large, strong hands. \"I've got to meet and greet people and get to know the organization. We're starting a different journey and now we need to see where we're going from here.\"\n\nIn an exclusive interview last week, Holmen acknowledged he has a different personality than Pladson, whom he knows as an acquaintance and describes as \"a cognitive person.\"\n\n\"I am relentless,\" Holmen said. \"If we set a goal, we will get there. I'm very forgiving, but I'm also demanding. For me, it's not about Ken. It's about what are we doing to take care of patients.\"\n\nThat's what he's done for more than 35 years, since graduating from the University of Minnesota Medical School. For more than 20 years, he practiced as an anesthesiologist, eventually serving as CEO of Associated Anesthesiologists and Associated Health Services until he moved to HealthPartners.\n\nA native of Forest City, Iowa (population 4,002), Holmen eventually became a five-time Top Doctor award winner as published in Mpls-St. Paul Magazine, earned a distinguished alumni award from Augsburg and a Service to Humanity Award from the United Hospital Foundation.\n\n\"I don't think there's anything extraordinary about me,\" Holmen said. \"I think I'm a pretty straightforward guy.\n\n\"I don't get mad. Never. Ever. Ask my kids. Just because you don't get mad doesn't mean you don't use discipline. You just don't do it in a fit of anger. ... On the other hand, if people are not prepared for a meeting, I will ask them to leave. You hold people to a standard. \"\n\nHolmen said he is looking at his new job with a commitment of at least eight years. To get a view into the man who will lead CentraCare into the next decade, he took about an hour out of his busy schedule to explain:\n\nThose who know Holmen describe his abilities\n\nHow did growing up in a small town in Iowa impact you?\n\n\"The small hospital in our town closed shortly after I finished high school. As a result, I've always been interested in the interplay with health care in small towns and within large systems. The journey of health care reform is complicated. The nearest big city was Mason City, about 30 miles away, and they had an evolving health care system there and, as a result, our hospital closed. Hospitals are really important to a community for lots of reasons. They're a source of community pride. It shares some common threads with the school system. It's a reason people move to town. \"\n\nWhat inspired you to go to medical school?\n\n\"I'm from the era of the Vietnam War. I had a student deferrment at the time and my draft number was very high. ... To get into medical school in the early '70s was very difficult. ... I vividly remember my acceptance letter for medical school. It's a very big day for me. You start that process and, 13 years later, you finish your training. I think lots of times we would like to think we know exactly where we're going. I suspect it's more like bumper bowling. You go one direction and \u2014 boom \u2014 you go at a little different angle. So I have been consistently bumped back into health care and medicine.\"\n\nWhat has driven your career?\n\n\"Many people in medicine have their eyes firmly set on a goal of being a CEO or president. That has not been my goal. My goal has been to add value and personally commit to take care of patients. If, along the way, people tapped me on the shoulder, that's cool. But it has not been my objective.\"\n\nHow did your current position prepare you for the responsibility you will take on in St. Cloud?\n\n\"My title doesn't really reflect what I did. My portfolio included (HealthPartners') western Wisconsin health care system. We had five critical access hospitals, very similar to CentraCare's other members. On the other hand, Regions is a Level 1 tertiary care center and trauma center. I had to understand those dynamics with the communities. The second thing was understanding how care is delivered from a primary physician to a high-end specialist. Third, understanding how health care reform and market changes in health care are affecting local hospitals as well as large systems \u2014 whether it's regulatory, political, economic or driven by consumer demand. Along the way, I participated in a lot of acquisitions. That was a good exposure for me to governments and legal regulatory issues.\"\n\nAre there comparisons between the two systems?\n\n\"I like to start looking at mission and vision statements. In both instances, it's about improving the health of the community. I think it's about engagement of employees for both. So, in that respect, they're very analagous. One of the major differences is that CentraCare does not have a large health plan and HealthPartners does. The notion of integrated health care organizations is an evolving topic. HealthPartners, early on, grew out of a health plan. CentraCare grew out of a hospital-based system. Now, they're both meeting in the middle.\"\n\nWhat was your motivation to come here?\n\n\"I'm a pretty analytical person. I start with fit. What is CentraCare looking for and what is Ken looking for? I was very blunt in the interview process. If the fit is not there, I'm gone. The fit from CentraCare's perspective was that they (wanted) somebody with a lot of background in health care systems, understand where health care was going, was familiar with the broad spectrum of payer issues, and I understand tertiary care hospitals and critical access hospitals, primary care and specialty care. I was a visible leader from a community and employee standpoint. To me, the fit lined up with where CentraCare would continue on its journey. And I am interested in helping organizations deliver health care in a slightly expanded way.\"\n\nYou said health care is not only about what happens with the patient within these walls. What does that mean?\n\n\"That's especially important for CentraCare because the geographical area is so large. ... The number one way to improve health care in the community is stuff that happens outside our walls. That's getting engaged with the community, the churches and civic organizations to improve health. It is now about the continuum of health care, starting when the mom is pregnant. What are the healthy lifestyles? No alcohol or smoking. Then we're managing and being participatory with the delivery, childhood immunizations and dealing with childhood obesity. If they need their appendix out, absolutely. That goes all the way through a person's life. What happens is we've had silos of health care. Right now, CentraCare probably has a bunch of those. We need to create an arc of the journey of the human experience that includes wellness but at the same time pursuing improved quality, a better patient experience and we always know cost pressures will continue. That's the triple aim and I'm a firm believer in our necessity to approach that.\"\n\nWhat challenge faces CentraCare as a result of the Affordable Care Act?\n\n\"People want to make health care political. I'm not going to do politics. I'm going to talk about the challenges for American health care.\n\n\"One is there is good evidence that if people have insurance, they have better health care. They have more preventative services, more timely care, they get their prescriptions, etc. We have swaths of our population that do not have insurance. I think as a community-based health system, we should understand that dynamic and work on it. I don't think we're the sole answer, but we should be engaged in it.\n\n\"Two, the ... language in the Affordable Care Act has taken political overtones, but I applaud the vision. Those of us in health care: Take accountability for this spectrum of care. I think we need to go there. It's not just about a cardiologist putting a stent in, or a family practice doctor diagnosing a cold. It's about all of us participating and adding value and higher quality.\n\n\"Third, since employers pay for much of health care, they're clearly saying 'Health care is too expensive.' The federal and state governments are saying it's too expensive, particularly as baby boomers retire. Affordability and cost need to be addressed. What I wish is we could drop the polarizing political rhetoric and address how we find insurance for folks, improve care and address quality issues. That's common ground we can all agree on. CentraCare acknowledges that in its vision statement. I want to put more meat on the bone.\"\n\nWhat can be done to balance the impact of baby boomers among employees leaving the work force and increasing numbers requiring care?\n\n\"How do we prepare the organization? One way is partnering with educational organizations. We need to find the young nurses, physical therapists, radiology technicians, nurses, doctors \u2014 whatever. Those organizations can help us make sure we have a work force that's trained and competent and enthusiastic about this career.\n\n\"A second way to look at that is, what kind of resources will we need? There are several major disease categories. One is neurosciences, degenerative neurological diseases \u2014 Alzheimer's, Parkinson's. Second is orthopedics. People are living longer and have healthier lifestyles. Third is cancer. As people get older, they have more cancer and they survive more cancer. You start with primary care and how to maintain healthy lifestyles \u2014 diabetes management and weight management, for example. You have to offer the basics and also the high-end services, because otherwise people will go somewhere else.\"\n\nHow do you grow beyond a 52.7 market share?\n\n\"Many patients will stay within a system because of ease of use. It's extremely important to take care of those people. However, there is a second population who will migrate past a river, past a city, past their primary care doctor to go to an excellent program. That's how the Mayo Clinic became what it is. I think CentraCare is ideally positioned to do both. We can make it amazingly easy for them to get high-quality affordable care. ... Creating those exceptional experiences with exceptional physicians, nurses and administrative support in a way that is very competitive is what I believe is the strategy for success.\"\n\nHow do you position CentraCare in light of potential competition from the Twin Cities, or Sanford Health moving in from the west?\n\n\"We have to focus on what we do and perform, perform, perform. We need to put renewed emphasis on those major areas of quality, experience and cost. That's job one. Job No. 2 is that I am a capitalist. Markets win. You can be a company and think you're the coolest thing in the world, but if the market doesn't validate or value what you're delivering, you'll find out pretty quick. Third, why do large systems form over large geographic distances? I think they're basing it on an economic model which has worked but I suspect will be threatened. So, if CentraCare pays attention to its Ps and Qs and can deliver more than what the big systems offer, I think the future is quite bright. And I wouldn't have taken the job if I felt otherwise.\"\n\nAbout Dr. Ken Holmen\n\nAge: 62.\n\nFamily: Wife, Linda (married 39 years); daughters, 36 and 32.\n\nInterests: Loves music.
