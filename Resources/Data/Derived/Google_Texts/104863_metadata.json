As if the mountain of debt, default and ruination of the EU\u2019s collective economy wasn\u2019t bad enough, now US President Barack Obama has started cold calling European leaders to offer them words of economic counsel.\n\nThis is the man, don\u2019t forget, who has single-handedly watched the US economy go to sleep on his watch. As Breitbart News pointed out last November, Obama\u2019s dreamy leftist economic policies have failed America. Think soaring debt, cash splashed on hopeless public spending schemes, ObamaCare\u2019s waste and stagnant middle class incomes coupled with flat-lining real growth and you would have to wonder just what words of advice he could offer.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nStill, it seems Obama rang and spoke with Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras last night to enforce his desire for a resolution. According to news.com Obama had earlier spoken with German Chancellor Angela Merkel by phone, urging her and her colleagues to find a solution before Greece\u2019s fiscal cold becomes Europe\u2019s influenza epidemic.\n\nSo just what did he say?\n\n\u201cWe continue to encourage all sides to participate constructively in those conversations,\u201d White House spokesman Josh Earnest said, renewing calls for a deal between Athens and its creditors.\n\nHe added: \u201cThe leaders agreed it is in everyone\u2019s interest to reach a durable agreement that will allow Greece to resume reforms, return to growth, and achieve debt sustainability within the eurozone. The leaders noted that their economics teams are monitoring the situation in Greece and remain in close contact.\u201d\n\nEarnest finished with a few words of delightful understatement, adding that the White House is aware that reaching a deal could be \u201cquite complicated.\u201d You think so, Josh?\n\nMeanwhile in Greece, the banks and the local stock exchange remained closed, a cap on withdrawals are still in place and liquidity remained critical.\n\nTomorrow there will be yet another meeting of financial ministers desperate to find out a way out \u2013 if indeed there really is one aside from catastrophic Greek debt default \u2013 but at least we know the issue now has the attention of the famously-aloof Barack Obama.\n\nOn Sunday, the 28 leaders of the full European Union will meet to assess the final proposals for Greece that European Union President Donald Tusk described as \u201cmaybe the most critical moment in our history\u201d.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Be Afraid: Obama Enters Greek Financial Crisis", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Be Afraid: Obama Enters Greek Financial Crisis", "title": "Be Afraid: Obama Enters Greek Financial Crisis - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/06/obama-military-jacket-smile-Reuters.jpg", "height": 480}, "updated_time": "2015-07-08T04:15:05-07:00", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/07/08/be-afraid-obama-wants-to-intervene-in-greek-financial-crisis/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Be Afraid: Obama Enters Greek Financial Crisis", "creator": "@sunsimonkent", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/06/obama-military-jacket-smile-Reuters.jpg", "title": "Be Afraid: Obama Enters Greek Financial Crisis - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "app_id": 1243316582352556, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "barack obama, eu crisis, Grexit, obamacare fail,Big Government, Breitbart London, Obama,obama european union", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "published_time": "2015-07-08T04:10:54-07:00", "section": "Big Government", "modified_time": "2015-07-08T04:15:05-07:00", "tag": "obamacare fail", "categories": "Big Government,Breitbart London,Obama"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0903\"", "article_summary": "SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERThe Greek financial crisis just got worse.\nOn Sunday, the 28 leaders of the full European Union will meet to assess the final proposals for Greece that European Union President Donald Tusk described as \u201cmaybe the most critical moment in our history\u201d.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERStill, it seems Obama rang and spoke with Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras last night to enforce his desire for a resolution.\nTomorrow there will be yet another meeting of financial ministers desperate to find out a way out \u2013 if indeed there really is one aside from catastrophic Greek debt default \u2013 but at least we know the issue now has the attention of the famously-aloof Barack Obama.\nAs if the mountain of debt, default and ruination of the EU\u2019s collective economy wasn\u2019t bad enough, now US President Barack Obama has started cold calling European leaders to offer them words of economic counsel."}
