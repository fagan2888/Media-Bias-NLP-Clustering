Chris Culliver, who has missed the last three games because of a left knee injury, is also active.\n\nThe Redskins inactives are cornerback DeAngelo Hall (toe), center Kory Lichtensteiger (neck/shoulder), nose tackle Terrance Knighton (migraine), tight end Anthony McCoy, quarterback Robert Griffin III, wide receiver Rashad Ross and defensive end Frank Kearse.\n\nWide receiver DeSean Jackson returns to the lineup since tearing his left hamstring in the season opener. Knighton did not travel with the team because of his migraine and Lichtensteiger will miss his third consecutive game.\n\nOutside linebacker Ryan Kerrigan, who had surgery on his broken right hand on Oct. 26, is active and will play with a cast. Inside linebacker Keenan Robinson, who missed practice this week with a shoulder injury, is also active.\n\nThe Patriots inactives are linebacker Jamie Collins, left tackle Marcus Cannon, running back James White, wide receiver Keshawn Martin, defensive end Jabaal Sheard, right guard Tre Jackson and defensive end Trey Flowers.\n\nCollins was added to the injury report late in the week because of an illness.
