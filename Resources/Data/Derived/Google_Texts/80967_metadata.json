Joe Heck is trying to hold on to the seat he won in 2010, but Democratic challenger Erin Bilbray, a Nevada native and political consultant, isn\u2019t making it easy.\n\nBilbray, who runs a nonprofit children\u2019s health care clinic with her pediatrician husband, is attacking Heck as a Washington insider who voted to shut down the government in October.\n\n\u201cI feel that maybe Joe has become so far removed from Las Vegas and Henderson that he really doesn\u2019t understand what\u2019s going on,\u201d she said.\n\nHeck disagrees. He sits on the powerful House Armed Services Committee and the Select Committee on Intelligence, where he\u2019s focused on national security, education and the economy.\n\n\u201cI just tell people to look at my record, look at what I ran on and whether or not I fulfilled the obligations I said I\u2019d do,\u201d he said.\n\nIt\u2019s safe to say every re-election is difficult for the person who represents Nevada\u2019s 3rd Congressional District. Heck, a military doctor and Army colonel, ousted Democratic Rep. Dina Titus in 2010 to get the job. (Titus then won a more reliably Democratic seat representing Las Vegas.)\n\nDistrict 3 is split fairly evenly between Republicans and Democrats. Political analysts say it leans Republican in 2014, but President Barack Obama won it in 2012. The Washington Post rates Heck\u2019s seat as 96 percent safe, but the district has also pingponged between Republican and Democrat over the years.\n\nIts unique status has drawn the attention of national political operatives and outside groups. In 2012, conservative outside groups spent $3.2 million to help get Heck elected.\n\nOutside spending on the Democratic side is relatively small, but Bilbray is supported by a robust national Democratic congressional campaign, where she has been singled out for extra training and fundraising.\n\nAll this means the campaign has the potential to go negative. Come this fall, expect to see outside groups like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and American Action Network run TV ads in support of Heck and against Bilbray. It\u2019s possible national Democrats will run ads for Bilbray \u2014 though they haven\u2019t bought air time yet, to the Heck team\u2019s great glee.\n\nBoth candidates claim the other side has no dirt to dig up. Instead, Heck and Bilbray say they want to run a campaign on the issues.\n\nHeck is a moderate Republican who supports immigration reform and wants to rewrite the 2010 health care reform law known as Obamacare, saying it did nothing to improve patient care. He also touts his office\u2019s constituent outreach program and legislation he\u2019s pushing to promote international tourism in Las Vegas.\n\n\u201cWe have to take care of our constituents, and I think we\u2019ve done that,\u201d he said.\n\nBilbray is a moderate pro-choice Democrat who is deeply involved in women\u2019s issues and says Heck hasn\u2019t done enough to support Southern Nevadans still struggling with the economy. Her father, James Bilbray, served in Congress from 1987 to 1995.\n\n\u201cI am in the trenches every day, and I see what families are going through,\u201d she said.\n\nBoth candidates also claim momentum is on their side.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no question that this is going to be a bare-knuckle brawl,\u201d Bilbray said. \u201cBut I feel that we\u2019re going to win this. We\u2019ve got so much energy and excitement on this campaign.\u201d\n\nHeck points to the fact he beat former Nevada Assembly Speaker John Oceguera by eight points in 2012 as an example of how District 3 residents want him as their representative in Congress. Heck also has twice as much campaign cash on hand.\n\n\u201cIt will be an interesting race,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t take anything for granted. We\u2019re going to campaign hard and look forward to getting our message out to the voters of District 3.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "In a relatively quiet Nevada election year, the race to represent Henderson and Boulder City in Congress will be big and bitter in one of America\u2019s last true swing districts in the U.S. House of Representatives.
