The company is raising premiums by 24 percent in the third year, Earley said.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s been profitable and that\u2019s part of the reason why you\u2019re seeing the significant increases,\u201d Earley said. \u201cThere\u2019s also been some concerns on some of the factors that the federal government had put in place to offer some stability as you work to a point where this market is much more predictable. The funding for some of those factors has not come through and that has caused some very, very big concerns on our part and even a strong consideration on whether or not we could stay in this market.\u201d\n\nUltimately the company decided it has a \u201csocial mission\u201d to serve the needs of the citizens of West Virginia, Earley said.\n\n\u201cWe need to get the pricing to the point where this segment of the market is self-supporting. Hopefully, we are getting to that point,\u201d he said.\n\nThere were more than 33,000 state residents who signed up for insurance in the exchange last year. Earley expects the numbers to stay about the same or decline slightly. Subsidies from the federal government will help 80 percent of them pay the premium increases.\n\nThe people who have the insurance use it, Earley said.\n\n\u201cThe utilization and access is higher than expected and that surge has not gone down at all,\u201d he said. \u201cWe expect it to continue at that level.\u201d\n\nThere is competition in the exchange this year in 15 counties for Highmark Blue Cross Blue Shield. CareSource will be an option for residents living in Boone, Brooke, Cabell, Clay, Hancock, Kanawha, Lincoln, Marshall, Mason, Ohio, Pleasants, Putnam, Wayne, Wirt and Wood counties.\n\n\u201cCompetition in the market I believe is good for the consumer,\u201d Earley said. \u201cSo we have no concerns about that.\u201d\n\nEarley said those getting insurance through the exchange are generally people in their late 40s, 50s and early 60s.\n\n\u201cThey are employed working in a job that doesn\u2019t offer benefits or working multiple part-time positions. They earn too much to be on Medicaid,\u201d Earley said.\n\nHighmark Blue Cross Blue Shield has made subtle changes to its different insurance plans. There are 15 plans off the exchange and 17 on the exchange.\n\nThe enrollment began Sunday and will continue through Jan. 31, 2016. Enrollment must be completed by Dec. 15 if coverage is to begin Jan. 1, 2016. Enrollment can take place online at healthcare.gov or by calling 1-800-318-2596.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Company raising rates and staying in as part of its", "og": {"site_name": "WV MetroNews", "description": "Company raising rates and staying in as part of its \u201csocial mission.\u201d", "title": "Highmark Blue Cross Blue Shield considered pulling out of Obamacare exchange", "url": "http://wvmetronews.com/2015/11/02/highmark-blue-cross-blue-shield-was-considering-pulling-out-of-obamacare-exchange/", "image": {"width": 800, "identifier": "http://wvmetronews.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/open-enrollment-obamacare.png", "height": 515}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://wvmetronews.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/open-enrollment-obamacare.png?w=640", "site": "@wvmetronews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 439959236158130, "pages": 327490709044}, "article": {"published_time": "2015-11-02T23:30:48+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-11-03T14:38:04+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "\u201cWe expect it to continue at that level.\u201dThere is competition in the exchange this year in 15 counties for Highmark Blue Cross Blue Shield.\nHighmark Blue Cross Blue Shield has made subtle changes to its different insurance plans.\nBy Jeff Jenkins in News | November 02, 2015 at 6:30PMCHARLESTON, W.Va. \u2014 Highmark Blue Cross Blue Shield almost pulled out of the state\u2019s health insurance exchange after two years, company president Fred Earley told MetroNews Monday following the start-up of a new open enrollment period.\n\u201cI also give credit to the Insurance Commission for working with us to be able to stay in the market.\u201dHighmark Blue Cross Blue Shield has been the only company in the West Virginia exchange through the first two years of Obamacare.\nThere were more than 33,000 state residents who signed up for insurance in the exchange last year."}
