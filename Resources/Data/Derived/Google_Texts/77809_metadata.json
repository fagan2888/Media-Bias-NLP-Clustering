One of the latest is in Dubuque, Iowa, where the City Council is moving ahead with a plan to ban sledding in all but two of its 50 parks.\n\nSEE ALSO: Illegal contact: Nanny state regulators to blow the whistle on football?\n\n\u201cWe have all kinds of parks that have hills on them,\u201d said Marie Ware, Dubuque\u2019s leisure services manager. \u201cWe can\u2019t manage the risk at all of those places.\u201d\n\nA study by Columbus, Ohio-based Center for Injury Research and Policy at Nationwide Children\u2019s Hospital found that between 1997 and 2007, more than 20,000 children each year were treated at emergency rooms for sledding-related injuries.\n\nIn meetings leading up to the ban, Dubuque council members lamented the move but said it was the only responsible choice given liability concerns and demands from the city\u2019s insurance carrier. They pointed to judgments in sledding lawsuits in the past decade, such as a $2 million judgment against Omaha, Nebraska, after a 5-year-old girl was paralyzed when she hit a tree and a $2.75 million payment when a man in Sioux City, Iowa, slid into a sign and injured his spinal cord.\n\nSome cities have opted for less drastic measures in the last several years rather than an all-out ban, including Des Moines, Iowa; Montville, New Jersey; Lincoln, Nebraska; and Columbia City, Indiana. By banning sledding on certain slopes or posting signs warning people to sled at their own risk, cities lessen their liability if someone is seriously hurt, but they\u2019re still more vulnerable to lawsuits than if they had adopted an outright ban.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s the small central Illinois city of Paxton, where park district officials removed the sledding hill in 2013.\n\nIt was more of a dirt mound, created years ago to cover a pile of concrete, metal and other junk, recreation director Neal McKenry said, but given how flat the area is, the 20-foot rise often was crowded with sledders. There was concern someone would slam into trees that had grown on the mound.\n\n\u201cObviously, many people used this area to sled in the winter, but the park district never promoted it as a sled hill,\u201d McKenry said. \u201cIt was simply a built-up mound of dirt that people happened to sled on.\u201d The area is now being used as a dog park.\n\nIn Omaha, the city banned sledding at a popular hill as a test one winter after losing a lawsuit, but decided to allow it again after most people ignored the restriction.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t practical,\u201d assistant city attorney Tom Mumgaard said. \u201cPeople wouldn\u2019t abide by the ban.\u201d\n\nInstead, the city has posted signs warning of sledding risks and workers at the site of the failed ban put pads around posts and hay bales around trees. Mumgaard said courts in Nebraska have decided cities must protect people, even if they make poor choices.\n\nMost people realize that cities must restrict potentially dangerous activities to protect people and guard against costly lawsuits, said Kenneth Bond, a New York lawyer who represents local governments. In the past, people might have embraced a Wild West philosophy of individuals being solely responsible for their actions, but now they expect government to prevent dangers whenever possible.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a great idea on the frontier, but we don\u2019t live on the frontier anymore,\u201d Bond said.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t sit well with Natasha Koss, 40, who frequently sleds with her 5-year-old daughter Elsa in Marquette, Michigan.\n\nKoss sometimes requires Elsa to wear a helmet. When they try a particular hill for the first time, her husband does a few runs solo as a precaution. She said she\u2019d report any safety issues to city authorities but couldn\u2019t imagine filing suit over a sledding mishap.\n\n\u201cI would most certainly take personal responsibility,\u201d she said. \u201cYou need to have a mindset to make the best decisions for your own safety.\u201d\n\nHowever, Steve King, who runs a website that promotes sledding, said he understands why cities impose restrictions. He notes that most sledders don\u2019t wear helmets and it\u2019s near impossible to steer away from trees, rocks or signs.\n\n\u201cWe live in a lawsuit-happy society and cities are just being protective by banning sledding in areas that pose a risk for injury or death,\u201d King said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "As anyone who has grown up around snow knows, part of the fun of sledding is the risk of soaring off a jump, but some cities have opted to close hills rather than risk large liability claims.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "As anyone who has grown up around snow knows, part of the fun of sledding is the risk of soaring off a jump, but some cities have opted to close hills rather than risk large liability claims.", "title": "Nanny State: Sledding faces limits over liability concerns", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jan/4/liability-concerns-prompt-some-cities-to-limit-sle/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/01/04/d4430c81a7d046006a0f6a7067005d20.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/01/04/d4430c81a7d046006a0f6a7067005d20.jpg", "title": "Nanny State: Sledding faces limits over liability concerns", "description": "As anyone who has grown up around snow knows, part of the fun of sledding is the risk of soaring off a jump, but some cities have opted to close hills rather than risk large liability claims.", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "news_keywords": "Marie Ware"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde2bb\"", "article_summary": "And then there\u2019s the small central Illinois city of Paxton, where park district officials removed the sledding hill in 2013.\n\u201cObviously, many people used this area to sled in the winter, but the park district never promoted it as a sled hill,\u201d McKenry said.\nBut faced with the potential bill from sledding injuries, some cities have opted to close hills rather than risk large liability claims.\nOne of the latest is in Dubuque, Iowa, where the City Council is moving ahead with a plan to ban sledding in all but two of its 50 parks.\nNo one tracks how many cities have banned or limited sledding, but the list grows every year."}
