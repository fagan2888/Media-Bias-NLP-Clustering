It's back to Gross, but most people would rather use another word. The latest economic reports are not good :\n\nThe nation\u2019s gross domestic product expanded just 0.5 percent on an annualized pace. Businesses cut back on investments with a severity not seen since the financial crisis.\n\nNot seen since the financial crisis? I guess they mean 2008.\n\nAccording to this summary, apprehension and caution are now the words.\n\nFrankly, you see this every day, or at least those of us who spend a good chunk of our week talking to business managers and entrepreneurs.\n\nApprehension is what happens when President Obama projects a disdain for the capitalist system that most of us operate in.\n\nCaution is what happens when the federal government dumps Obamacare and massive regulations on the laps of business people who are trying to keep their enterprises ahead of the game.\n\nThe White House was speechless on Friday. They just couldn't understand why Mr. GDP is not dancing to the \"hope and change\" melodies. They blamed low oil prices and weak foreign demand.\n\nThey will probably blame Bush for this rut next week. Why not? This bunch is always blaming Bush even as we celebrate the 7th anniversary of the stimulus they passed\n\nP.S.
