CBSSports.com analytics guru Jerry Palm projected Clemson into the College Football Playoff, Mackensie Alexander insisted he was the best cornerback in the country and head coach Dabo Swinney after Saturday\u2019s Death Valley scrimmage explained his \u201c15\u201d chat with the team.\n\nAs in the year 2015, and Clemson\u2019s goal of winning a 15th Atlantic Coast Conference championship.\n\nSwinney also noted that tickets are printed for 12 games this season.\n\n\u201cBut we want them to print them for 15,\u201d he said.\n\nThat would require a national championship run.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not about being 15-0,\u201d Swinney said. \u201cThat would be great, but we just want to be the best we can be.\u201d\n\nBack-pedalling, even slightly, seems difficult at Clemson these days. The confidence brimming within the program is unprecedented over the last quarter-century.\n\nIt\u2019s a bit odd. While Clemson is a popular favorite to win the ACC, the Tigers own one conference title since Florida State joined the conference and have lost three straight games to the Seminoles.\n\nLast time Clemson beat South Carolina and won an ACC championship in the same season? In 1991, before any current Tiger player was born.\n\nLast time Clemson won a conference title and a bowl game in the same year? Way back in 1988, when Swinney was in high school.\n\nBut all this Clemson enthusiasm is entertaining and hopefully the Tigers don\u2019t publically switch to coach-speak. Good, clean honesty is fun for fans, good for recruiting and a blast for foes if it all falls apart.\n\nWhat, you\u2019d rather have Nick Saban trying to convince folks to fret about Wofford\u2019s holder?\n\nFightin\u2019 Tigers\n\nClemson prowess is built around the return of dazzling sophomore quarterback Deshaun Watson and the return of a cast of fast skill-position players from a team that went 10-3.\n\nSure, offensive coordinator Chad Morris is gone. Both lines lack experience and there is a sudden serious lack of depth at linebacker.\n\nBut Clemson is busy fighting to improve. In fact, linebacker Ben Boulware spent part of Saturday\u2019s scrimmage fighting with left guard Eric Mac Lain. Boulware was ejected by referees after getting in the last punch.\n\n\u201cWay uncalled for,\u201d defensive coordinator Brent Venables said of Boulware\u2019s behavior.\n\nVenables wasn\u2019t too upset with Alexander\u2019s \u201cI\u2019m the best \u2026 It\u2019s not close\u201d boasting earlier in the week.\n\n\u201cClearly somebody led the witness, because he doesn\u2019t say much,\u201d Venables said of the sophomore, an Immokalee, Fla., native who declined to talk with reporters last season.\n\n\u201cMackensie works hard,\u201d Venables went on. \u201cHe takes coaching well. He wants us coaches to have great confidence in him; that means a lot to him. He does his job well. He\u2019ll be fine.\u201d\n\nAlexander didn\u2019t give up a touchdown pass over the final nine games of the 2014 season.\n\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t walk around here acting like he\u2019s above reproach. I want guys to have humility, but if somebody challenges them or calls them out, hopefully their actions are louder than their words. This is an emotional, intense game. Occasionally you\u2019re going to see a little edge to a guy out there. That\u2019s OK, as long as you can back it up.\n\n\u201cVery few guys have both the ability and the edge. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a bad thing at all. But I think it also needs to be within the team concept.\u201d\n\nDabo\u2019s bananas\n\nRed flags stick out amid the orange upside. Linebacker depth took a hit this week when starter Korrin Wiggins was lost with a knee injury Wednesday and second-teamer Korie Rogers, a redshirt freshman, quit football to focus on his Pre-Business degree.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re real green,\u201d Swinney said of the backup linebackers. \u201cI mean, I like my bananas real yellow with a little bit of brown on them.\u201d\n\nVenables described the situation as \u201can emergency.\u201d\n\n\u201cParticularly looking forward a year from now and where we\u2019re at,\u201d he said. \u201cSo we\u2019ve got this really important recruiting class. This one and next one are critical, as critical as I\u2019ve been around.\u201d\n\nStill, nothing tempers expectations around Death Valley. For one thing, very few contributors remain from the 2013 Clemson team picked to win a conference title at the ACC Football Kickoff.\n\nFlorida State wound up walloping the Tigers, 51-14, on the way to a national championship. Boosted by a big night at Clemson, Jameis Winston won the Heisman Trophy.\n\nThat was so 22 months ago.\n\n\u201cI love this team, I really do,\u201d Swinney said Saturday. \u201cI like the make-up of the team; I think they\u2019ve got a great spirit to them. We\u2019re just not very good yet. But we will be.\u201d\n\nFollow Gene Sapakoff on Twitter @sapakoff", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Sapakoff: Print tickets for 15 games?
