The Shreveport, La., city council in December voted to approve an anti-discrimination ordinance to protect residents from discrimination based on their sexual and gender identity.

The lone dissenting voice on the measure was that of right-wing councilman, Ron Webb. At the time of the vote, Webb said he opposed the measure because, “The Bible tells you homosexuals are an abomination.”

The ordinance passed with a 6-to-1 vote, but Webb wasted little time before introducing a resolution to repeal it.

The residents of Shreveport — most of whom supported the ordinance — came out this week to comment on the repeal. Pamela Raintree was one among dozens of community members to address the council, and her testimony was a passionate and scathing indictment of Webb’s ignorance and bigotry.
