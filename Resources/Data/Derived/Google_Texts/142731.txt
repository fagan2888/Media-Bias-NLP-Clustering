Scarlett Johansson, who turns 29 on Friday, has one more thing to celebrate - her new December Vogue cover.

The newly engaged actress looks stunning on the magazine's Mexican edition, with her hair in a loose updo, dark red lipstick and rose gold eyeshadow.

Johansson, who was photographed by Sofia Sanchez and Mauro Mongiello, also flaunts her hourglass shape sporting a Dolce & Gabbana white lace-up corset in the photo.

It's not much of a surprise that Johansson would wear Dolce & Gabbana, since she recently appeared in the brand's commercial for its new scent "The One."

Titled Street of Dreams, the black-and-white short film was directed by Martin Scorsese and also features actor Matthew McConaughey.

The commercial marked the first time Johansson and McConaughey, who star as ex-lovers, have worked together onscreen.

Johansson previously covered Vogue in 2012 where she spoke about her 2010 split from Ryan Reynolds.

"It was horrible," she told the magazine. "Of course it's horrible. It was devastating. It really throws you. You think that your life is going to be one way, and then, for various reasons or whatever, it doesn't work out."

She continued: "This was something I never thought I would be doing. And there's no way to navigate it. Nobody can give you the right answer. It's never anything you want to hear. It's a very lonely thing. It's like the loneliest thing you'll ever do, in some way."

The Avengers star has since moved on and got engaged to Romain Dauriac in September. The pair went public with their relationship in November 2012.
