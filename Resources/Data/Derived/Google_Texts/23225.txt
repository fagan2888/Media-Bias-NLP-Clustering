Denver recorded record high temperatures Saturday for the second straight day.

The temperature at Denver International Airport was 72 degrees just before noon, which broke the record high for Feb. 7 of 71, set in 1987.

The National Weather Service noted that 72 degrees is the normal high for May 16.

The mid-afternoon temperature hit 74 degrees â€”three degrees short of the highest mark ever recorded in February.

The city already broke a 71-year record high by three degrees on Friday when the high temperature soared to 70 degrees.

The low temperature was 41 degrees overnight, said Kari Bowen, meteorologist for the National Weather Service in Denver. That was a record high low temperature for the day.
