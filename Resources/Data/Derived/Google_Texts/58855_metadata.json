The doctors massaged it back to life and he went back inside his mom\u2019s womb. April lived.\n\nNow 2 years old, Elijah lives.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThose who\u2019ve spent time with him say it is as if he already understands the fragility of life. He looks at people \u201cas if he has a lifetime of experiences and can relate to what they\u2019re saying.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA stark contrast from his sister.\n\n\u201cEllianna is more like, \u2018Bring it on,\u2019\u201d April says of her firstborn. \u201cWhereas, Elijah, since he was born, is a really cautious little boy.\u201d\n\nEllianna dives into sandwiches and candy, but Elijah\u2019s appetite is small.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if he really knows hunger,\u201d April said. She keeps pre-sliced avocados and celery in the fridge to get Elijah to eat.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut Elliana looks out for her little brother, who spent his first year of life developing slowly, constrained by a feeding tube and hospital visits.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Leffingwells don\u2019t expect Elijah will face any ill effects in the future\u2014and they\u2019re excited for their little boy\u2019s miracle life.\n\n\u201cI look forward to what Elijah will be able to do,\u201d Jason said. \u201cBecause he\u2019s here for a purpose.
