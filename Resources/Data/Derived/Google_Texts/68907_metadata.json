From Continuing Care Retirement Communities (CCRCs) and stand-alone memory care and rehabilitation facilities, to entrance-fee models and rental options and hybrids of all of the above, continuum care is departing from a sullen and depressing nursing home stigma. There is no better place to witness the evolution of senior care, than in Arizona \u2014 where continuum care is a booming business.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s always going to be a need for assisted living and assisted care,\u201d explains Chris Harrison, Southwest office leader for The Weitz Company. \u201cBut if you look at the heat map, most of the concentrated builds reside on the smile: California, Arizona, Texas, Southeast Florida and up the coast.\u201d\n\nCoinciding with the metamorphosis of the type of care and housing being offered, is a comparably evolved demographic of seniors seeking more than simply warm weather and an attractive landing pad.\n\n\u201cThe oncoming senior population is looking for more of an urban/mixed-use feel when seeking senior retirement and living options,\u201d Harrison says. \u201cThey like restaurants, retail, activities and continuing education, with access to nearby colleges and universities.\u201d\n\nAccording to Harrison and GPE Commercial Advisors Executive Vice President Julie Johnson, these factors will increase in importance in the next decade and beyond, as the Baby Boomers transition into senior living.\n\nAlthough the Baby Boomers may be years from making the physical move into a Continuing Care Retirement Community (the typical age of entry is 82), they\u2019re impacting senior housing now.\n\n\u201cThey are the decision makers for their parents who are now in \u2014 or are going into \u2014 senior care,\u201d says Johnson. \u201cThe qualities Baby Boomers are looking for in senior care for their parents are also what they ultimately want for themselves.\u201d\n\nJohnson goes on to explain that Baby boomers have high standards, the expectation for amenities and affordability.\n\nSo how do the expectations for more amenities and lower-living costs translate into an existing senior-care market?\n\n\u201cThe rental model is definitely growing,\u201d Johnson says, \u201crather than the entrance-fee CCRC.\u201d\n\nAccording to Johnson, this is partly due to the Millennial mindset transcending into the senior-living population by passing along the desire for a lock and leave lifestyle. But there\u2019s more to the story.\n\n\u201cThe recession affected a lot of nest eggs,\u201d Johnson says, \u201cWhen it was over and people were finally able to sell their homes, that\u2019s when they were finally able to enter memory- and-assisted-living care.\u201d\n\nAlso trending: an increase of stand-alone memory care and rehabilitation facilities.\n\n\u201cWith more awareness of Alzheimer\u2019s and dementia, 30 percent of senior living facilities (whether stand alone or CCRC) offer memory care,\u201d Johnson says. \u201cUnfortunately, the statistics are growing exponentially.\n\n\u201cIf you look at the Affordable Care Act and the improvement of long-term outcome,\u201d says C. Mark Hansen, president and CEO of Sant\u00e9, a healthcare real estate development company, \u201ccontinuity of care will become more and more important.\u201d\n\nAs a result of this, Hansen feels that continuum of care will keep moving toward an all-encompassing transitional-hybrid model of independent living that progresses to offering multiple levels of assisted care.\n\n\u201cWe have high-acuity assisted living, custodial nursing and amenities,\u201d Hansen says of in-progress Sant\u00e9 at Westgate. \u201cOccupants will have their own apartment, but once they make the decision for assistance, they won\u2019t have to move.\u201d\n\nPreventing displacement is a key component in the facelift of senior care.\n\n\u201cPeople moving into assisted living can be very traumatic and to have to do it more than once is even more difficult,\u201d Hansen says.\n\nSun Health\u2019s Executive Vice President Joe La Rue agrees.\n\n\u201cWe offer an insurance model with continuum care included,\u201d La Rue says, \u201cso that no matter what happens health wise or financially, we\u2019ll take care of you for life. We understand that to move someone is devastating \u2014 that\u2019s something we can\u2019t do.\u201d\n\nSun Health has also created a product that allows seniors to stay in their home, extending a bundle of services much like what you\u2019d receive in a CCRC, but with the added benefit of allowing an entrance fee in exchange for space on one of their campuses.\n\n\u201cPeople who really get the aging process are going to want to protect the downside risk,\u201d La Rue says.\n\nSenior care developers, operators and future tenants alike are also becoming more transparent in their expectation of needs \u2014 No. 1 being that they wouldn\u2019t touch a nursing-home type of environment with a 10-foot cane.\n\n\u201cNobody wants to move into Grandma\u2019s nursing home,\u201d La Rue say. \u201cEven the term \u2018assisted living\u2019 makes my skin crawl.\u201d\n\nThis evolution in mindset will most likely spur the advent of more hybrid senior care developments, such as Sun Health\u2019s The Colonnade, recipient NAHB Silver Award for The Best of 55+ Housing.\n\n\u201cThe Colonnade consists of a 40-acre campus with casitas that resemble single-family homes,\u201d La Rue explains. \u201cWe also have a section that we refer to as villas that are independent living units, as well as a new clubhouse with a pool, spa and yoga services and a meditation garden.\u201d\n\n\u201cIncoming senior tenants tend to feel younger than their parents did at the same stage of life,\u201d Johnson says. \u201cThey expect to live longer and will require more flexibility and choices \u2014 in amenities, floor plans and more.\u201d\n\nFreedom of choice and varied options is becoming increasingly more important.\n\n\u201cMany communities won\u2019t let you make changes to the environment,\u201d La Rue says. \u201cWe want to keep as much control and decision-making as possible with the individuals.\u201d\n\nAs senior care continues to move forward, one thing is clear: there won\u2019t be a shortage of options.\n\n\u201cThe biggest trend I\u2019m seeing is overbuilding,\u201d Hansen says. \u201cWe track every new facility being built in Maricopa County. We\u2019re in Gilbert and there are 20 senior living facilities alone. My prediction is that there will be an oversupply in the short term \u2014 the next three to four years. Once you get past that and Baby Boomers come online, that will solve that problem, but that\u2019s still quite a few years away.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"shareaholic": {"site_name": "AZ Big Media", "language": "en-US", "url": "http://azbigmedia.com/azre-magazine/modern-senior-living", "article_author_name": "Erin Davis", "image": "http://azbigmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Colonnade-HEADER.jpg", "site_id": "c7068c5a877ee4c28ed9348b2aa9b1b5", "article_published_time": "2016-05-24T15:39:53-07:00", "shareable_page": "true", "article_modified_time": "2016-05-27T00:50:45-07:00", "keywords": "sant\u00e9, sant\u00e9 at westgate, sant\u00e9 tucson, senior living arizona, senior living facilities, sun health, senior living, azre magazine", "wp_version": "7.8.0.3"}, "geo.region": "US-AZ", "geo.placename": "Phoenix", "description": "The face of senior living and assisted care facilities is changing into the kind of place you wouldn't mind staying in either.", "geo.position": "33.48435;-112.072817", "og": {"site_name": "AZ Big Media", "description": "The face of senior living and assisted care facilities is changing into the kind of place you wouldn't mind staying in either.", "title": "Amenity packed senior living facilities are the place to go | AZ Big Media", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 612, "identifier": "http://azbigmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Colonnade-HEADER.jpg", "height": 300}, "updated_time": "2016-05-25T11:14:04-07:00", "url": "http://azbigmedia.com/azre-magazine/modern-senior-living", "type": "article"}, "DC.Type": "Media", "twitter": {"description": "The face of senior living and assisted care facilities is changing into the kind of place you wouldn't mind staying in either.", "creator": "@AZBigMedia", "image": "http://azbigmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Colonnade-HEADER.jpg", "title": "Amenity packed senior living facilities are the place to go | AZ Big Media", "site": "@AZBigMedia", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "DC.Format": "html", "DC.Contributor": "Az Big Media", "DC.Publisher": "Az Big Media", "robots": "noodp", "DC.Date": 2014, "fb": {"app_id": 318236068321678}, "DC.Creator": "Eric Shepperd", "viewport": "width=device-width", "ICBM": "33.48435, -112.072817", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/azbigmedia", "section": "AZRE Magazine", "tag": "Sun Health", "published_time": "2016-05-24T08:39:53-07:00", "modified_time": "2016-05-25T11:14:04-07:00"}, "DC.Subject": "Print | Digital | Events | Expos", "DC.Language": "en-US", "DC.Title": "Az Big Media"}, "article_summary": "\u201cThere\u2019s always going to be a need for assisted living and assisted care,\u201d explains Chris Harrison, Southwest office leader for The Weitz Company.\nThe face of senior living and assisted care facilities is changing.\nThere is no better place to witness the evolution of senior care, than in Arizona \u2014 where continuum care is a booming business.\n\u201cWith more awareness of Alzheimer\u2019s and dementia, 30 percent of senior living facilities (whether stand alone or CCRC) offer memory care,\u201d Johnson says.\nWe\u2019re in Gilbert and there are 20 senior living facilities alone."}
