On Thursday's Daily Show \u2014 better late than never \u2014 Jon Stewart gave a nod of approval for the first Indian-American woman to win America's premier beauty pageant.\n\nIf that doesn't sound very Daily Show, there is a kicker: Not everyone was so pleased to see an Indian-American win, and they said so on Twitter (and elsewhere).\n\nStewart rolled his eyes at the stupid sniping aimed at Davuluri, but correspondent Aasif Mandvi \u2014 in a segment called \"Back in Brown\" (a takeoff on the recurring Lewis Black bit \"Back in Black\") \u2014 waved away the Twitter haters. Mandvi is mostly excited about this new benchmark in his fellow Indian-Americans' conquest of America. He gleefully pointed out that along with Davuluri, the reigning spelling-bee champ is Indian-American \u2014 and he won with a Yiddish word.\n\nMandvi's routine is a panoply of Indian-American jokes (\"wake up and smell the curry, Jon\"; \"if you like it, then you should have arranged a marriage with it\") mixed in with a triumphant proclamation of Indian-American conquest. His proof involves Indian-Americans selling the rest of the country junk food at convenience stores, then churning out doctors to help treat the resulting diabetes epidemic.\n\n\"You took this country away from the Indians,\" Mandvi crowed, \"and now a different group of Indians is taking it back.\"\n\nEarlier in the show, Stewart took a look at the conservative efforts to undermine ObamaCare, and the loopholes businesses are using to get around the law:\n\nFor the fun of it, Stewart brought on \"senior deranged millionaire\" John Hodgman to explain how his company, HodgeCo, gets around not only ObamaCare regulations, but also mandatory weekend pay and child labor laws. It is John Hodgman, so it is funny.
