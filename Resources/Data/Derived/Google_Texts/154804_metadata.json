(Jesse Costa/WBUR)\n\nIt\u2019s primary day in Massachusetts, which has one of the biggest stashes of delegates up for grabs among the 13 states holding presidential primaries and caucuses across the country on Tuesday.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot at stake in the Bay State for the two Democrats, which is why Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders were both here on Monday, making their final pitches ahead of Super Tuesday.\n\nSanders Stumps With Extra Energy, Urgency In Mass.\n\nMore than 3,500 people packed the Milton High School gym on Monday night, raising the temperature and making it shake for Bernie Sanders. The Vermont senator brought his unruly white hair and message of political revolution that he hopes will make him a winner.\n\n\u201cTomorrow, in 11 states, including Massachusetts, over 800 delegates are going to be elected to the Democratic convention, and we anticipate winning many of them and a majority of them right here in Massachusetts,\u201d said Sanders.\n\nSanders told the crowd, \u201cMassachusetts led the American Revolution. Now it\u2019s time for your state to lead a political revolution.\u201d He spoke with extra energy and urgency, at one point delighting the crowd when he whipped off his jacket in the over-heating gym.\n\n\u201cAlright, we\u2019re getting warmed up here,\u201d he said.\n\nSanders delivered his standard stump speech, railing against a corrupt campaign finance system, a broken criminal justice system, widening economic disparity and what he calls a rigged economy.\n\n\u201cReady for a radical idea? Well here it is. We\u2019re going to create an economy that works for everybody and not just the one percent,\u201d he said.\n\nTo help do that, Sanders proposes a massive jobs program, government-funded health care, tuition-free public colleges and a $15 minimum wage. And as the candidate without a superPAC, who\u2019s depended on small donors, Sanders sharpened a key difference with his Democratic opponent, Clinton.\n\n\u201cNow, I am not quite sure how you bring about real change in America if your superPAC collects millions and millions of dollars from Wall Street,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cAnd from drug companies and from the fossil fuel industry.\u201d\n\nThe most recent polls, including the latest from WBUR, have shown Sanders running behind Clinton in Massachusetts. But he does better than her with young voters, who made up much of Monday night\u2019s raucous crowd in Milton. So if he\u2019s to prevail Tuesday, he needs young voters like these to come out in big numbers. Voters like Brian Tal-Baker.\n\n\u201cI think he\u2019s running on a platform of hope and change and interest, rather than on fear and incremental change because we don\u2019t really think we can get anything done,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I think that he\u2019s interested in sort of getting us back to the basic principles of how a government needs to function.\u201d\n\nClinton Rallies In Boston, Reflects On Personal Connection To City\n\n\u201cAnd it\u2019s my honor to introduce to you the woman who is not only going to win Massachusetts tomorrow, but be the next president of the United States America.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s the way Boston Mayor Marty Walsh introduced Hillary Clinton earlier in the day. She rallied supporters in Boston\u2019s historic Old South Meeting House, where, like Sanders, Clinton made reference to America\u2019s revolutionary past: She noted this was where \u201cthe real Tea Party\u201d was born. And she talked about her personal connection to Boston.\n\n\u201cWhen I came to college here, Wellesley College back in the day, I fell in love with Wellesley and I fell in love with Boston,\u201d she said.\n\nDespite the close race here in Massachusetts among the Democrats, Clinton barely mentioned Sanders. Instead, she focused her sharpest attacks on the Republicans.\n\n\u201cYou know, if I were grading some of those Republicans, you remember the little box that used to be on your kids\u2019 report cards, \u2018play well with others\u2019? I\u2019d have to put a big \u2018no.\u2019 Democracy requires that we play well with others, that\u2019s what it\u2019s all about,\u201d she said.\n\nClinton\u2019s latest campaign theme is \u201cknocking down barriers\u201d \u2014 to opportunity, equality and the American Dream, as opposed to building up walls of division. She wants to create jobs by repairing the country\u2019s infrastructure. She promises to reduce student debt; defend and improve the Affordable Care Act, oppose the gun lobby; and work with Republicans when possible \u2014 and when it\u2019s not, to stand up to them.\n\n\u201cBut I\u2019ll say this for the Republicans, they are persistent, because they\u2019re back with the same economic policy, persistently wrong, but they don\u2019t quit,\u201d she said. \u201cSo it\u2019s going to be up to us to point out to the American people what the differences are and what the stakes are for every single working American.\u201d\n\nThe Old South Meeting House was packed. Many people were turned away, and after the event, Clinton went out in the street to address them.\n\nInside, Linda Merryweather, of Boston, said she\u2019s voting for Clinton because of her experience.\n\n\u201cShe is the candidate of choice, not just because she\u2019s a woman \u2014 but that\u2019s a great plus,\u201d she said. \u201cShe\u2019s the most qualified, especially for world politics. She can walk to any country in this world and be welcomed, and we don\u2019t have anyone like that, and I think she is the person who is the answer for this country.\u201d\n\nThat Clinton and Sanders were in Massachusetts on Monday is a measure of what\u2019s at stake. For Clinton, winning here is a chance to build momentum, following her decisive win in South Carolina on Saturday. She\u2019s also expected to do well across the South on Super Tuesday.\n\nFor Sanders, a win in Massachusetts is probably crucial. This is one of the country\u2019s most liberal states, and if the Vermont senator can\u2019t win here, it wouldn\u2019t bode well for the future of his campaign.\n\nRelated:\n\nStory continues below\n\nMost Popular Expand", "article_metadata": {"description": "That Clinton and Sanders were in Massachusetts on Monday is a measure of what's at stake today.
