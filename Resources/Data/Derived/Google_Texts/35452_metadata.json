It probably looks a little bit petty for them not to invite a major candidate because I raised money for other Second Amendment groups.\"\n\nMy book Gun Control on Trial told the story of how obstructionist the NRA was about the Heller case that established a firm Court-recognized right to personal ownership of commonly used weapons for self-defense in the home.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "Internal gun rights movement politics keep NRA away from Rand Paul.", "title": "Rand Paul: As Pro-Second Amendment as They Come, Cast Out by NRA", "url": "http://reason.com/blog/2015/04/09/rand-paul-as-pro-second-amendment-as-the", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14285800985621.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14285800985621.jpg", "description": "Internal gun rights movement politics keep NRA away from Rand Paul.", "site": "@reason", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Rand Paul: As Pro-Second Amendment as They Come, Cast Out by NRA"}, "fb": {"pages": 17548474116}, "article": {"tag": "Politics", "published_time": "2015-04-09T16:52:00+00:00", "author": "http://reason.com/people/brian-doherty"}, "msvalidate.01": "212A68A07785B3080038A845C4EE8905", "google-site-verification": "-AmMiilAN-pnjWt369CUWae-VQ-b9wmH4fSGyhbkQxw", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcbffa\"", "article_summary": "Daily Beast explores some arcane, to non-insiders, gun rights movement politics to explain why the National Rifle Association (NRA) is being mean to a candidate who is as pro-Second Amendment as they come, Rand Paul.\nRoughly, in case you didn't know, to many in that world, the NRA are the squishy equivocators of gun rights, and Paul is affiliated with some more hardcore ones in perceived war with the NRA.\nIt probably looks a little bit petty for them not to invite a major candidate because I raised money for other Second Amendment groups.\"\n\u201cSometimes the NRA doesn\u2019t like it when people are bigger defenders of the issue than they are,\u201d the source suggested.\n\"To not be invited, probably, will serve more to cast aspersions on their group than it would on me."}
