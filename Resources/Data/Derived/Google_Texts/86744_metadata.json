David Baumgartner is executive medical director of specialty medicine at Mercy Health Physician Partners.\n\nBy Bill Manns and David Baumgartner\n\nOne of the many benefits of living in West Michigan is the access we all have to outstanding physicians who are dedicated to keeping our community healthy. Unfortunately, our region's largest hospital system has recently taken steps to dramatically change the way physicians are taught, mentored and even scheduled across Grand Rapids.\n\nThe result will reduce patient access to doctors, while limiting critical experiences for up-and-coming physicians.\n\nMedical resident physicians represent a critical resource for any community \u2013 a resident is typically a doctor who has completed medical school and one or more internships. During residency, these doctors serve patients in a wide range of care environments and consider their career options, including how and where they want to practice medicine.\n\nFor more than 15 years, Grand Rapids Medical Education Partners (GRMEP) has provided a truly collaborative learning environment for medical residents, giving them time at multiple hospitals across multiple specialties. GRMEP, composed of Mercy Health Saint Mary's, Spectrum Health, Michigan State University and Grand Valley State University, has sponsored programs to give medical residents a diverse range of clinical experiences and the ability to advance the community's health care services while lowering costs.\n\nWith GRMEP, any notion of competition among hospitals was set aside for the greater good. That is now changing.\n\nOver the past few months, Spectrum Health has been driving \"negotiations\" in an attempt to essentially take control of GRMEP and secure a competitive advantage in assigning medical residents and developing relationships with these doctors. These conversations have not been \"negotiations,\" but simply Spectrum telling the consortium what they wanted to do, and are going to do. Within the past several weeks, Spectrum has filed an application to create Spectrum-only residency programs.\n\nRelated: Saint Mary's, Spectrum square off over control of medical residency program\n\nThey have stated they are doing so for greater brand recognition. And because they're not the same health system they were when the consortium was formed.\n\nOur community has also changed \u2013 Grand Rapids has grown as a well-known space for life sciences, medical research and health care opportunities. The region has become a recognized attractive place for residents and long-term medical professionals. There has been significant development in important specialized areas, such as pediatrics, mental health care and rehabilitation.\n\nWe are concerned that the work that's been done over the last two decades \u2013 to create a national reputation of Grand Rapids as an up-and-coming hub of innovative health care and medical research \u2013 will be diminished by any one organization's decision to focus on their own brand building at the expense of the rest of the community.\n\nIn addition, the Affordable Care Act has changed how we deliver care and how consumers and patients interact with their providers. Consumer engagement and knowledge about health care is on the upswing, and patients are increasingly voicing their opinions and concerns about the cost and value of their care.\n\nIn our view, these changes mean our community needs MORE collaboration across hospitals, not less. That's why Mercy Health Saint Mary's supports a collaborative, community-wide approach to physician residency \u2013 and we will continue to do so with other health care provider partners in the community.\n\nMercy Health Saint Mary's is committed to providing the best patient access to expertise, and the best medical training opportunities for our community in the most cost-effective way. To date, our collaborative approach has effectively reduced the total cost of education and health care for the West Michigan region and \u2013 given the pace of unpredictable change in the industry \u2013 Mercy Health Saint Mary's believes this value-driven approach is now more important than ever.\n\nWe also believe that graduate medical education is more important than any single hospital, any single brand \u2013 period.\n\nTo submit a guest opinion to The Grand Rapids Press, email Zane McMillin at zmcmilli@mlive.com", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "grand-rapids-guest-column, opinion", "title": "Grand Rapids loses if Spectrum Health gets its way, Mercy Health says", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Grand Rapids loses if Spectrum Health gets its way, Mercy Health says\", \"link\": \"http://www.mlive.com/opinion/grand-rapids/index.ssf/2015/09/grand_rapids_loses_if_spectrum.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://image.mlive.com/home/mlive-media/width620/img/grpress/opinion_impact/photo/18752121-standard.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"16949152\", \"pub_date\": \"2015-09-14T15:32:05Z\", \"author\": \"Guest writer\", \"tags\": [\"@gr-river\",\"grand-rapids-guest-column\"] }", "twitter": {"image": "http://image.mlive.com/home/mlive-media/width620/img/grpress/opinion_impact/photo/18752121-standard.jpg", "description": "Mercy Health Saint Mary's explains its side of an ongoing dispute over medical residencies.", "site": "@mlive", "card": "summary", "title": "Grand Rapids loses if Spectrum Health gets its way, Mercy Health says"}, "article_date_updated": "Monday, September 14, 2015, 11:32 AM", "parsely-metadata": "{\"short_title\": \"\", \"image_url\": \"http://media.mlive.com/grpress/opinion_impact/photo/bill-mannsjpg-4a50466f1e763c8e.jpg\", \"author_name\": \"grwriter\", \"author_nickname\": \"Guest writer\", \"author_id\": \"8019114\", \"source_blog_name\": \"Grand Rapids Opinion\", \"source_blog_url\": \"http://www.mlive.com/opinion/grand-rapids/index.ssf/\", \"sponsored_content\": \"0\" }", "og": {"site_name": "MLive.com", "description": "Mercy Health Saint Mary's explains its side of an ongoing dispute over medical residencies.", "title": "Grand Rapids loses if Spectrum Health gets its way, Mercy Health says", "url": "http://www.mlive.com/opinion/grand-rapids/index.ssf/2015/09/grand_rapids_loses_if_spectrum.html", "image": "http://image.mlive.com/home/mlive-media/width620/img/grpress/opinion_impact/photo/18752121-standard.jpg", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "MLive.com", "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Monday, September 14, 2015, 11:30 AM", "article_author": "Guest writer", "Description": "Mercy Health Saint Mary's explains its side of an ongoing dispute over medical residencies."}, "article_summary": "Bill Manns is president at Mercy Health Saint Mary's.\nThere has been significant development in important specialized areas, such as pediatrics, mental health care and rehabilitation.\nThat's why Mercy Health Saint Mary's supports a collaborative, community-wide approach to physician residency \u2013 and we will continue to do so with other health care provider partners in the community.\nOur community has also changed \u2013 Grand Rapids has grown as a well-known space for life sciences, medical research and health care opportunities.\nRelated: Saint Mary's, Spectrum square off over control of medical residency programThey have stated they are doing so for greater brand recognition."}
