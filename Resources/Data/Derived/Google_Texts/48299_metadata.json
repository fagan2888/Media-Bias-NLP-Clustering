It was the least he could do to win the good graces of his colleagues, after leading the party to a stand-off that tanked its popularity and gave Obama a victory.\n\nSince then, Cruz has been quiet, and the GOP has recovered from the debacle of October, helped\u2014in large part\u2014by the initial problems with the rollout of the Affordable Care Act. He\u2019s even tried to build rapport with other senators, a change of pace for Cruz, who\u2014in his first year\u2014had the attitude of a reality TV star\u2014he wasn\u2019t there to make friends.\n\nBut all things must end, and after a moment of silence, Cruz is back to his usual playbook of mercenary tactics and ideological crusading. Not only did he force an unpopular vote on the debt ceiling, angering his colleagues, but\u2014as POLITICO reports\u2014he\u2019s returned to campaigning against his party. This time, by way of the Madison Project, a group that also works to defeat Republican incumbents. Here\u2019s POLITICO with more:\n\nThis time, the tea party freshman has helped the lower-profile Madison Project, a political action committee working to defeat McConnell and Sens. Pat Roberts of Kansas and Thad Cochran of Mississippi \u2014 and prop up other primary challengers in 2014 midterm races. In the mailer, Cruz asks donors to \u201cpull out all the stops\u201d to elect \u201csolid, principled, conservative fighters\u201d who will \u201cnot answer to the party bosses in Washington, D.C.\u201d\n\nLike Jimmy McNulty, Cruz is talented and charismatic, but trapped by his own self-righteousness. He can try to make good on his presidential ambitions, but as long as he continues to spite his co-partisans, it\u2019s hard to see how they go forward.\n\nWith that said, it\u2019s worth noting the extent to which Cruz reflects the GOP base. According to recent data from the Pew Research Center, Tea Party Republicans don\u2019t see the GOP as especially conservative, despite its hard right turn\u201444 percent of Republicans and Republican \u201cleaners\u201d who agree with the Tea Party say that the GOP is conservative or very conservative. Indeed, just 28 percent of Republicans overall say that the party does a good job of \u201cstanding up for its traditional positions.\u201d\n\nTo outside observers, this is ludicrous. Between its crusade against the Affordable Care Act, its cuts to social services (like food stamps), and its continued push for lower taxes and regulation, the GOP seems as conservative as ever.\n\nBut this, it seems, isn\u2019t enough. The conservative base doesn\u2019t want representation as much as it wants to hand defeats to Barack Obama, even if\u2014in the case of the debt ceiling\u2014they cause massive shocks to the global economy.", "article_metadata": {"twitter": {"site": "@thedailybeast", "card": "summary", "creator": "@jbouie"}, "keywords": "U.S. Politics", "publicationDate": 201402262201, "wrap": "/content/dailybeast/voxbox/jamelle-bouie", "description": "Ted Cruz has returned to his old tricks of undermining his colleagues and working to end their careers.", "pageNum": 1, "title": "Ted Cruz is Still Not Here to Make Friends", "environment": "dev", "platform": "desktop", "template": "article", "type": "house", "parsely-page": "{\"title\":\"Ted Cruz is Still Not Here to Make Friends\",\"link\":\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/02/26/ted-cruz-is-still-not-here-to-make-friends.html\",\"image_url\":\"http://cdn.thedailybeast.com/content/dailybeast/articles/2014/02/26/ted-cruz-is-still-not-here-to-make-friends/jcr:content/image.crop.410.273.jpg/46448609.cached.jpg\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":\"/content/dailybeast/articles/2014/02/26/ted-cruz-is-still-not-here-to-make-friends\",\"pub_date\":\"2014-02-26T22:01:00+00:00\",\"section\":\"\",\"author\":\"Jamelle Bouie\",\"tags\":[\"u_s_politics0\"]}", "news_keywords": "US Politics", "tags": "u_s_politics0", "fb": {"admins": "1703087,30000737,1117577220,1276800108,931159,514915512", "app_id": 189930913679}, "authors": "Jamelle Bouie", "article": {"published_time": "2014-02-26T22:01:00.000Z", "author": "http://www.thedailybeast.com/contributors/jamelle-bouiehtml"}, "resourceType": "dailybeast2/components/pages/article", "contentpath": "/content/dailybeast/articles/2014/02/26/ted-cruz-is-still-not-here-to-make-friends", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Beast", "description": "Ted Cruz has returned to his old tricks of undermining his colleagues and working to end their careers.", "title": "Ted Cruz is Still Not Here to Make Friends", "url": "http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/02/26/ted-cruz-is-still-not-here-to-make-friends.html", "image": "http://cdn.thedailybeast.com/content/dailybeast/articles/2014/02/26/ted-cruz-is-still-not-here-to-make-friends/jcr:content/image.img.2000.jpg/1393458292387.cached.jpg", "type": "article"}, "authorIds": "/etc/authors/j/jamelle-bouie", "content-type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdbc29\"", "article_summary": "Ted Cruz has returned to his old tricks of undermining his colleagues and working to end their careers.\nAfter the government shutdown, a chastened Ted Cruz promised not to work with the Senate Conservative Fund, an outside group which works to defeat incumbent Republican senators.\nThis time, by way of the Madison Project, a group that also works to defeat Republican incumbents.\nHe\u2019s even tried to build rapport with other senators, a change of pace for Cruz, who\u2014in his first year\u2014had the attitude of a reality TV star\u2014he wasn\u2019t there to make friends.\nWith that said, it\u2019s worth noting the extent to which Cruz reflects the GOP base."}
