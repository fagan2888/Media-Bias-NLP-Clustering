Public Spots, Health Effects Seen\n\nBy Qainat Khan\n\nWBUR\n\nOn a break from her job near South Station, Vivian Taylor was on her way in to use the station\u2019s ladies\u2019 room when a man suddenly blocked her way, she recalls.\n\n\u201cWhere do you think you\u2019re going?\u201d he asked her, threateningly.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t want to have a confrontation while I was at work, but it was a very unsettling experience,\u201d said Taylor, a transgender woman who served in Iraq in 2009 and 2010. \u201cFor about the next half hour, that fella just stood there \u2014 as if he was on guard \u2014 standing there glaring at me in front of the door to the bathroom.\u201d\n\nA survey out today suggests Taylor\u2019s experience is not uncommon. The results, based on 452 responses, show that almost two-thirds of transgender and gender non-conforming Massachusetts residents experienced discrimination last year in public places, including transportation, retail and health care settings.\n\nThe survey, conducted by The Fenway Institute at Fenway Health and the Massachusetts Transgender Political Coalition, found that respondents who reported discrimination had an 84 percent increased risk of adverse physical symptoms associated with stress \u2014 such as headaches, upset stomachs and pounding hearts \u2014 and a 99 percent increased risk of emotional symptoms compared to respondents who reported no such discrimination in the past year.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a hard thing to have to go through the world just having to be that conscious of your own safety,\u201d Taylor, who was a respondent on the survey, said. \u201cThat\u2019s a very stressful experience, to just always know that it\u2019s possible that somebody is going to come after you for no other reason than what you look like, or how you dress, or what your voice sounds like.\u201d\n\nThe survey also found that 20 percent of respondents postponed or did not seek health care because of prior discrimination in a medical setting. Five percent of respondents said a health care provider refused to provide them with care because of their gender identity.\n\n\u201cThe fear of not wanting to be discriminated against, the fear of not being seen for who you are and respected, I think, is a really powerful one,\u201d Sari Reisner, an epidemiologist and co-author of the survey, said. \u201cThe reality is that for transgender people, being socially gender affirmed is very, very important. So going into an encounter \u2014 especially a medical encounter [can] be a pretty vulnerable proposition. Depending on what exam you\u2019re undergoing, you may need to undress, you may need to disclose personal health information.\u201d\n\nReisner says we can think about trans people\u2019s fear to seek medical care in the context of what\u2019s known as a minority stress model in medical literature, which posits that for racial, ethnic and sexual minorities, social stressors harm health.\n\n\u201cWe could talk about a gender identity social stress model, where discrimination that\u2019s enacted, where somebody experiences discrimination, then that makes them anticipate future discrimination,\u201d Reisner said. \u201cSo you might see postponement of care as anticipatory: not accessing care because they\u2019ve already been discriminated against.\u201d\n\nWhile the method \u2014 a cross-sectional survey \u2014 cannot establish a causal relationship between experiencing discrimination and having negative health outcomes, Reisner says the link is statistically significant.\n\n\u201cThe probability of having a particular negative health outcome is increased as a function of people experiencing discrimination,\u201d Reisner said.\n\nThe link could be causal, Reisner said, but further studies are needed to determine that.\n\nThe survey has a number of recommendations, including providing cultural competency training to health care providers and frontline staff.\n\nAnother recommendation in the survey includes adopting a statewide law \u2014 now pending in the Legislature \u2014 making it illegal to discriminate in public accommodations on the basis of gender identity.\n\nMassachusetts already has a nondiscrimination law that makes it illegal to discriminate on the basis of gender identity in housing, employment, credit and education.\n\n\u201cIf there are laws protecting folks, then trans folks don\u2019t have to worry about being at the mercy of an individual\u2019s feelings about trans people,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cIf trans people are just left at the mercy of public opinion, then that\u2019s a dangerous place for us to be.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Two-thirds of transgender people surveyed report discrimination in public spots such as stores and transportation, and the resulting stress may affect health.", "og": {"site_name": "commonhealth", "description": "Two-thirds of transgender people surveyed report discrimination in public spots such as stores and transportation, and the resulting stress may affect health.", "title": "Survey: Transgender Discrimination In Mass.
