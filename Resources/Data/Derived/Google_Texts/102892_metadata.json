At the governor\u2019s encouragement, the Legislature approved the school\u2019s two-year, $27 million budget in June, and Atkinson was promoted to founding dean in November.\n\nAlong the way, she quietly has recruited some of the best medical educators and practitioners in the country. If all goes as planned and accreditation is approved as expected, the first 60 students will begin classes in fall 2017, benefiting from full-ride scholarships made possible by the Engelstad Family Foundation and others.\n\nBy the time classes begin, the medical school will have 68 faculty members, give-or-take. Twenty-five have been hired so far, and they, along with key administrators, show the strength of the program Atkinson is building.\n\nHere\u2019s a sampling of the talent Atkinson is lining up and how \u2014 in addition to training a new generation of MDs \u2014 the recruits will elevate the level of health care in Southern Nevada:\n\n\u2022 Dr. Tracey Green, most recently Nevada\u2019s chief medical officer, will oversee the development and operation of three community clinics that will serve Medicaid, uninsured and underserved patients. Such clinics are an underpinning of the school\u2019s community outreach. And, because of her state job, Green has a good grasp of the Affordable Care Act, Nevada\u2019s Medicaid program, community clinics and mental health issues.\n\n\u2022 Cancer researcher Dr. Parvesh Kumar will run the school\u2019s cancer center and oversee its clinical research. Previously, his guidance helped cancer research centers at two medical schools become designated National Cancer Institute facilities.\n\n\u2022 Clinical caregiver Dr. Michael Nasiak specializes in using biomedical technology to analyze a person\u2019s risk for disease based on genetics and, with that knowledge, how specific therapies can be applied to address those issues. His most recent posts before arriving here: a medical genetics fellowship at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center and a gig at the Los Angeles Biomedical Research Institute at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center.\n\n\u2022 Community health policy expert Dr. Laura Culley will help connect medical school students with the community, tapping her experience as medical director of Volunteers in Medicine of Southern Nevada. Community engagement is a crucial component of Atkinson\u2019s vision to immerse medical students in the trenches of community health care.\n\n\u2022 On the nuts-and-bolts side of operating the medical school, Dr. Ellen Cosgrove was recruited from the University of Washington School of Medicine to be a vice dean overseeing admissions, curriculum, student and faculty affairs, and graduate medical education, with help from Dr. Samuel Parrish, who came here from Quinnipiac University in Hamden, Conn.\n\nThese terrific faculty members have a valuable mentor in their boss, Atkinson, who arrived at UNLV after serving as the emeritus vice chancellor at the University of Kansas School of Medicine. Among her accomplishments: She was elected to the Institute of Medicine of the National Academy of Sciences and appointed by President Barack Obama to the Presidential Commission for the Study of Bioethical Issues.\n\nThere has been no decision on the precise location of the medical school, although most likely it will be in the downtown medical district. Initially, students will meet at two locations: a UNLV dental school building downtown on Shadow Lane and at the Veterans Affairs hospital in North Las Vegas.\n\nThe construction of a permanent home for the medical school will come in time. But its foundation now is being laid, and an excellent one it is.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Several exciting hires are poised to make the fledgling institution a success.", "og": {"site_name": "LasVegasSun.com", "description": "Several exciting hires are poised to make the fledgling institution a success.", "title": "The infant UNLV School of Medicine is growing strong", "url": "//lasvegassun.com/news/2016/apr/04/the-infant-unlv-school-of-medicine-is-growing-stro/", "image": "http://asset.lasvegassun.com/media/assets/images/icons/sun-app-large.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"account_id": 12055942, "card": "summary", "site": "@LasVegasSun"}, "fb": {"app_id": 112951308742607}, "vr": {"type": "text"}, "article": {"published_time": "2016-04-04T02:00"}, "verify-v1": "ABQIAAAA8L3JFDSZBbRKiOI0oC2hURQtzf2N5nUcl5FoJ4HJzSUUnGQdoBRCXoBzqBg3VizzahR0b1gDldhrew", "y_key": "33c272341f5beade", "news_keywords": "The Sunday"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1bca\"", "article_summary": "The construction of a permanent home for the medical school will come in time.\nBy the time classes begin, the medical school will have 68 faculty members, give-or-take.\nThere has been no decision on the precise location of the medical school, although most likely it will be in the downtown medical district.\nCommunity engagement is a crucial component of Atkinson\u2019s vision to immerse medical students in the trenches of community health care.\nWith one thoughtful, solid hire at a time, Dr. Barbara Atkinson is building UNLV\u2019s School of Medicine."}
