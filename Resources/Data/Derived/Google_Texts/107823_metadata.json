Let the man in your life know that it is OK to get outside and he will look great with this manly travel bottle.\n\nLogitec Harmony Smart Control won\u2019t get Dad off the couch, but will make his viewing experience even better.

The Keyport slide 2.0 will make your Dad the envy of the neighborhood, and since he already has all kinds of gadgets, what better than one for his keys.\n\nThe Outdoor Dad is the guy that loves everything from manning the BBQ to bike riding, and these gifts will be just the thing to keep him in his outside state of mind. The Mastrad A01900 Pure Fizz Soda Maker for $79 dollars will let Dad be the grill master as well as the king of pop. This portable soda maker is great to take outside to the picnic table. Now Dad can have his own specially made soda to go with that awesome BBQ dinner on Father\u2019s Day, and it\u2019s stainless steel exterior makes for a manly bottle of pop.\n\nNow maybe barbecue really is the big summer thing that Dad does at home, and maybe Dad\u2019s house is the entertaining hub of the neighborhood.
