Pete Sessions\u2019 big donors do not appear to be jumping ship to support a challenge from his right.\n\nJust one of tea party activist Katrina Pierson\u2019s 19 largest donors previously donated to Sessions, R-Dallas.\n\nRussell J. Ramsland gave $500 to Sessions\u2019 2010 re-election effort. He\u2019s given the federal maximum of $2,600 to the Pierson campaign.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t leave Pete as much as Pete left me,\u201d Ramsland said. \u201cHe\u2019s been very clear to us that he represents [House Speaker] John Boehner; he doesn\u2019t really represent us.\u201d\n\nRamsland said Sessions abandoned his base by not strongly supporting attempts to defund the Affordable Care Act and not pushing for a special investigation into the 2012 Benghazi attacks. He referred to Sessions as a \u201cbig-government guy.\u201d\n\nSessions has pushed back at such criticism, saying he\u2019s part of a leadership team that has worked to cut federal spending.\n\nAs for Pierson, Ramsland said she has a \u201cvery solid grounding in the principles of free enterprise and limited government within its constitutional grounds.\u201d\n\nPierson\u2019s supporters hope her campaign can mirror Sen. Ted Cruz\u2019s tea party-backed defeat of establishment conservative Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst in the 2012 Republican primary. But Cruz had much more financial help, while Pierson trails Sessions badly in fundraising.\n\nYear-end campaign reports showed that Sessions, the chairman of the powerful House Rules Committee, had about $1.3 million on hand, to $50,000 for Pierson.\n\nPierson is expected to receive an endorsement from a top tea party group, the Tea Party Express, at an event Wednesday.\n\nOn Twitter:\n\n@bkamisar", "article_metadata": {"description": "The shortage of fundraising is a key hindrance in her effort to oust the veteran Republican congressman.", "og": {"description": "The shortage of fundraising is a key hindrance in her effort to oust the veteran Republican congressman.", "title": "Just one big donor leaves Pete Sessions for tea party challenger Katrina Pierson", "url": "http://www.dallasnews.com/news/politics/headlines/20140204-just-one-big-donor-leaves-pete-sessions-for-tea-party-challenger-katrina-pierson.ece", "image": {"width": 1024, "identifier": "http://www.dallasnews.com/incoming/20140109-pete-sessions.ece/BINARY/original/Pete+Sessions", "height": 682}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "type": "article"}, "LastModifiedDate": "2014-02-05T14:43:29Z", "twitter": {"site": "@dallasnews", "card": "summary", "creator": "@dallasnews"}, "PublishDate": "2014-02-05T04:11:36Z", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Just one big donor leaves Pete Sessions for tea party challenger Katrina Pierson\", \"link\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/news/politics/headlines/20140204-just-one-big-donor-leaves-pete-sessions-for-tea-party-challenger-katrina-pierson.ece\", \"image_url\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/incoming/20140109-pete-sessions.ece/BINARY/original/Pete+Sessions\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"1417500\", \"pub_date\": \"2014-02-05T04:11:36Z\", \"section\": \"Politics Headlines\", \"author\": \"BEN KAMISAR\", \"tags\": [\"dallas\", \"dallas fort worth\", \"dallas news\", \"dallas fort worth news\", \"dfw news\", \"dallas local news\", \"dallas fort worth local news\", \"dallas newspaper\", \"dallas morning news\", \"dallas morning news newspaper\"]}", "fb": {"admins": 1043783589, "page_id": 20946638799, "app_id": 258290334265148}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "cXenseParse": {"recs": {"image": "http://www.dallasnews.com/incoming/20140109-pete-sessions.ece/ALTERNATES/w660/Pete+Sessions", "publishtime": "2014-02-05T04:11:36Z"}}, "news_keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9a3e\"", "article_summary": "Pierson is expected to receive an endorsement from a top tea party group, the Tea Party Express, at an event Wednesday.\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Rep.
