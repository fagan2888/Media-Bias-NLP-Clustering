GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. (WOOD) — U.S. Rep. Fred Upton stopped by “To The Point” this week to talk about what’s going on in Washington; from the visit of a foreign dignitary to the House of Representative to what could happen to the Affordable Care Act.

The Republican from St. Joseph also talked about the showdown on funding for the Department of Homeland Security.

“This issue itself goes back to the immigration issue, which the president did this by executive order,” Upton said. “I’m one who believes that yes, we need immigration reform, but we need to work; it needs to be a legislative solution versus an executive order. So the president was wrong in doing this.”

“A federal judge ruled that the president’s executive order should not be able to stand. It’s now been a couple weeks they haven’t been; the appeal is not overturned,” Upton continued. “What this one federal judge did down in Texas — I’m not a lawyer, but my sense is that that order, the current order, will stay for months to come bookcase the argument. Even the president himself said 22 times he didn’t have the authority to do what he ultimately did.”

Above, Upton talks about immigration, the difference between Republicans and the president on foreign policy, and more on this March 15, 2015 episode of “To The Point.”
