They pressed him to extend the March 31 enrollment deadline, but White House press secretary Jay Carney rejected the idea.\n\nRepublicans said the administration put in jeopardy the personal information of Americans by taking the website live before security testing was fully completed.\n\nFederal law requires all government computer systems to have a security certification before going live.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"Rating": "General", "news_keywords": "Top,Obamacare,executive,troubled,healthcare,website,launch,steps,new,private,sector,role", "original-source": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2490474/Top-Obamacare-executive-troubled-healthcare-website-launch-steps-new-private-sector-role.html", "doc-class": "Living Document", "twitter": {"description": "Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services exec Tony Trenkle resigned yesterday and Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius (left) also faced calls to quit over the botched roll-out.", "title": "Top obamacare exec behind website steps down", "url": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2490474/Top-Obamacare-executive-troubled-healthcare-website-launch-steps-new-private-sector-role.html", "app": {"id": {"ipad": 400442503, "iphone": 384101264}}, "image": "http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2013/11/07/article-2490474-1940AB9400000578-111_636x382.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image", "account_id": 15438913}, "robots": "noodp,noydir,all,noarchive", "msvalidate.01": "12E6B4B813EB44C9BFC8F6A21F1D01F5", "fb": {"app_id": 146202712090395}, "MSSmartTagsPreventParsing": "true", "articleid": 2490474, "divclasspage": "articlePage", "keywords": "Top,Obamacare,executive,troubled,healthcare,website,launch,steps,new,private,sector,role", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/DailyMail", "published_time": "2013-11-07T13:21:33.000Zyyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss z", "author": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/search.html?s=&authornamef=Becky+Evans", "section": "News", "modified_time": "2013-11-07T15:08:42.000Zyyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss z", "tag": "Top Obamacare executive troubled healthcare website launch steps new private sector role"}, "verify-v1": "DXwlrsxbqxSv+FTFkWUfgflBvFJfx2YbNf/HmABrVyY=", "y_key": "1a7e912afbfcab2f", "og": {"site_name": "Mail Online", "description": "Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services exec Tony Trenkle resigned yesterday and Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius (left) also faced calls to quit over the botched roll-out.", "title": "Top obamacare exec behind website steps down", "url": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2490474/Top-Obamacare-executive-troubled-healthcare-website-launch-steps-new-private-sector-role.html", "image": {"width": 636, "identifier": "http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2013/11/07/article-2490474-1940AB9400000578-111_636x382.jpg", "height": 382}, "type": "article"}, "channel": "News", "description": "Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services exec Tony Trenkle resigned yesterday and Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius (left) also faced calls to quit over the botched roll-out."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf77a\"", "article_summary": "His departure comes after mainly Republican Congress members called for the resignation of Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius yesterday.\nTony Trenkle, the chief information officer for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, has resigned and will move into the private sector.\nDuring two hours in the Senate Finance Committee witness chair, Sebelius conceded the website launch was deeply flawed.\nTop Obamacare executive behind troubled healthcare website launch steps down for new private sector roleTony Trenkle, chief information officer for Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, has resignedCMS spokeswoman Julie Bataille said he has moved to role in private sectorComes as calls for Kathleen Sebelius to resign over website debacleA top Obamacare executive behind the flawed roll-out of the health insurance website has stepped down.\nRepublicans said the administration put in jeopardy the personal information of Americans by taking the website live before security testing was fully completed."}
