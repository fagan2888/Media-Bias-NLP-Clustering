Louie Gohmert (R-Texas).\n\nGohmert is bringing Hannity as his guest to the president's annual address, according to a Dallas Morning News report. Both are regular critics of President Barack Obama, with Gohmert even filling in for Hannity on his show on occasion.\n\nHannity may not want to leave Capitol Hill after this Tuesday's address. This week he said that's he considering running for office.\n\n\"The answer is yes. I\u2019d think about it,\u201d Hannity said during a Tuesday Twitter Q&A on Fox News. \u201cIt would be in either Texas or Florida.\u201d\n\nHannity currently lives in New York, but said he's leaving \"as soon as I can\" because the state is anti-conservative and \"[New York Gov.] Andrew Cuomo doesn't want us here.\"\n\nGohmert isn't the only Texas Republican bringing a contentious State of the Union guest. Rep. Steve Stockman is bringing Chad Henderson, a former Obama campaign volunteer who caused a stir in October when, amid Obamacare website enrollment woes, he told reporters that he successfully signed up, only to reveal later he did not.\n\n\u201cI look forward to giving Chad the opportunity to attend the State of the Union Address. Now when President Obama speaks about ObamaCare the media will have someone they can cut to,\u201d Stockman said in a statement. \u201cI encourage the President to acknowledge him and his story.\u201d\n\nHenderson told BuzzFeed last week that he expects Stockman to use him to mock Obamacare's troubled health care rollout, but said he couldn't turn down the chance to attend the State of the Union.\n\n\"I\u2019m not going to pretend that I\u2019m gonna be his friend,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m anticipating that he\u2019s going to use me a whipping post and mock me, but I hope I\u2019m wrong and we can all be adults and let me enjoy this honor.\u201d\n\nAlso on HuffPost: Unforgettable State of The Union Moments Unforgettable State of The Union Moments\n\n1 of 12 Justice Alito Mouths 'Not True' During the 2010 State of the Union, Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito mouthed the words \"not true,\" in response to President Barack Obama's statement that the Court's ruling in the Citizens United case had \"open[ed] the floodgates for special interests -- including foreign corporations -- to spend without limit in our elections.\" Share this slide:\n\nAP", "article_metadata": {"description": "WASHINGTON -- Conservative radio show host Sean Hannity will be at the State of the Union next week, thanks to Rep.
