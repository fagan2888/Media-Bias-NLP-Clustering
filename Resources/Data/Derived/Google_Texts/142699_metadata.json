These were among the actors that had Cannes buzzing:\n\n\u2014 Steve Carell: It was an open question which star of Bennett Miller\u2019s \u201cFoxcatcher\u201d turned in the most impressive performance. There\u2019s Channing Tatum as Olympic wrestler Mark Schultz, a physically potent but emotionally stunted man. And as his older sibling and mentor, Mark Ruffalo\u2019s brotherly physicality is also essential. But Carell, with a prosthetic nose and grayed hair, was the one to cause the biggest stir at Cannes for his dramatic turn as the creepy multi-millionaire John du Pont who\u2019s obsessed with the other two.\n\n\u2014 Kristen Stewart: There\u2019s a clever irony to casting one of the most famous American actresses as the assistant to a European star, played by Juliette Binoche. But in Olivier Assayas\u2019 \u201cClouds of Sils Maria,\u201d Stewart does more than wink at her fame. She\u2019s natural and intelligent in a way she hasn\u2019t been perhaps since the 2009 \u201cAdventureland.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Timothy Spall: Great artists have often been given majestic big-screen incarnations. In Mike Leigh\u2019s biopic of British master J.M.W. Turner, Spall takes another route. His Turner is a humble, grunting worker whose grand artistry is hidden beneath his gruff manner.\n\n\u2014 Marion Cotillard: The Dardenne brothers have never before cast a major star as a protagonist, but they said they were smitten by Cotillard after a brief encounter. In their \u201cTwo Days, One Night,\u201d Cotillard proved (to most, although not all) that her stardom didn\u2019t interfere in telling a story about a working class woman trying to convince her co-workers to vote against a raise that will eliminate her job.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The most buzzed-about performances at Cannes", "title": "The most buzzed-about performances at Cannes", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The most buzzed-about performances at Cannes", "title": "The most buzzed-about performances at Cannes", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/05/25/the_most_buzzed_about_performances_at_cannes/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/05/france-cannes-in-the-name-of-my-daughter-red-carpet.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The most buzzed-about performances at Cannes", "title": "The most buzzed-about performances at Cannes", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/05/france-cannes-in-the-name-of-my-daughter-red-carpet.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Jake Coyle", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Topics: From the Wires, Entertainment News, NewsCANNES, France (AP) \u2014 The 67th annual Cannes Film Festival featured a number of remarkable performances, many of them from big-name stars.\nThere\u2019s Channing Tatum as Olympic wrestler Mark Schultz, a physically potent but emotionally stunted man.\nTurner, Spall takes another route.\nThese were among the actors that had Cannes buzzing:\u2014 Steve Carell: It was an open question which star of Bennett Miller\u2019s \u201cFoxcatcher\u201d turned in the most impressive performance.\n\u2014 Kristen Stewart: There\u2019s a clever irony to casting one of the most famous American actresses as the assistant to a European star, played by Juliette Binoche."}
