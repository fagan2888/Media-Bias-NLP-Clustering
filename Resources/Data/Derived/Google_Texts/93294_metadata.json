He was in serious but stable condition at Medical Center of Aurora South on Sunday night.\n\nA neighbor saw the man in a back yard in the 2700 block of South Mobile Street and called for help just before 6 p.m.\n\nThe hand was recovered from the man\u2019s garage, said Wendy Lippman, a spokeswoman for Aurora Fire Department.\n\nPolice took the lead in the case at that point, she said.\n\nLt. Eric Wittman said that although Aurora police assisted the fire department with the call, there was nothing criminal about the self-mutilation. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t criminal in nature, because it involved a person doing this to himself.\u201d\n\nThe man\u2019s age was not released.\n\n\u201cI can tell you it\u2019s not a child or a young adult,\u201d Wittman said. \u201cIt was a full-grown adult who, obviously, was having a psychological episode.\u201d\n\nJoey Bunch: 303-954-1174, jbunch@denverpost.com or twitter.com/joeybunch", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Naked man with severed hand found in yard in Aurora", "title": "Naked man with severed hand found in yard in Aurora", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2013/10/20/naked-man-with-severed-hand-found-in-yard-in-aurora/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "height": 630}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2013-10-20T19:36:55+00:00", "modified_time": "2013-10-20T19:36:55+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0c99\"", "article_summary": "He was in serious but stable condition at Medical Center of Aurora South on Sunday night.\nThe hand was recovered from the man\u2019s garage, said Wendy Lippman, a spokeswoman for Aurora Fire Department.\nA man in psychological distress apparently cut off his own hand and was found naked outside by a neighbor Sunday night, Aurora police and fire officials said.\nHe used a hand tool inside his garage, where his left hand was found.\nA neighbor saw the man in a back yard in the 2700 block of South Mobile Street and called for help just before 6 p.m."}
