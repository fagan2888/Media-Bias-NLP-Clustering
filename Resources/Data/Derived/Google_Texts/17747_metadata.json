About 6 percent of respondents report that value-based payments comprised more than half their revenue in the first six months of the year.\n\nThe vast majority of respondents \u2013 nearly 80 percent \u2013 reported that less than 10 percent of their revenue in the first two quarters came from value-based contracts. However, nearly 40 percent of respondents said they anticipated generating at least 20 percent of their revenue over the next 24 months through value-based contracts.\n\n\u201cIn a lot of those models, the use of the hospital or inpatient care is considered a failure. Nobody wants to be in the hospital,\u201d said York. \u201cThat\u2019s a huge strategy shift for organizations that are carrying the hospital legacy model into the future and trying to figure out how to get customers, that patient base, to support what they\u2019ve already built, and then they still have to grow.\u201d\n\nDespite the relatively slow adoption of value-based care, \u201cfor the most part we\u2019re still experiencing as an industry the deterioration of the fee-for-service inpatient model,\u201d York said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re starting to see kinds of models evolve around no doctors \u2013 leveraging Skype to do primary care visits, having mobile e-visits, taking pictures on your cellphone for dermatology \u2013 that don\u2019t include any bricks and mortar,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s having a huge impact on the current model and also the reimbursement.\u201d\n\nThe challenge for CFOs, York says, \u201cis determining where your payment stream will be coming from in the future, how much of your business is value-based, and where that is headed.\u201d\n\n", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/news/sinking-inpatient-census-causing-headaches-hospital-cfos", "image": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/sinking.jpg", "site_name": "Healthcare Finance News", "description": "While reducing reliance on expensive inpatient care is a sensible goal for hospitals, the transition away from a bricks-and-mortar, fee-for-service model is creating tremendous pressures on chief financial officers.", "title": "Sinking inpatient census causing headaches for hospital CFOs"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/sinking.jpg"}, "description": "While reducing reliance on expensive inpatient care is a sensible goal for hospitals, the transition away from a bricks-and-mortar, fee-for-service model is creating tremendous pressures on chief financial officers.", "site": "@HC_Finance", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Sinking inpatient census causing headaches for hospital CFOs"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "Inpatient utilization decreased at not-for-profit hospitals in the first half of this year while outpatient utilization increased, according to a recent survey by management consulting firm Kaufman Hall.&#13; The survey results reflect the ongoing transformation of the healthcare system away from fee-for-service payment models that emphasize and reward inpatient care and toward a more value-based, lower-intensity care system.", "viewport": "width=device-width; initial-scale=1.0; maximum-scale=1.0; user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1773\"", "article_summary": "\u201cIn a lot of those models, the use of the hospital or inpatient care is considered a failure.\nInpatient utilization decreased at not-for-profit hospitals in the first half of this year while outpatient utilization increased, according to a recent survey by management consulting firm Kaufman Hall.\nThe survey results reflect the ongoing transformation of the healthcare system away from fee-for-service payment models that emphasize and reward inpatient care and toward a more value-based, lower-intensity care system.\nWhile reducing reliance on expensive inpatient care is a noble and sensible goal, the transition away from a bricks-and-mortar, fee-for-service model is creating tremendous pressures for hospitals and their chief financial officers.\nMeanwhile, 72 percent of respondents said outpatient utilization had increased in the first two quarters of 2014."}
