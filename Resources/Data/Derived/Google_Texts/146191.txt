Heroin and opiate addiction affect every corner of New Jersey.

Overdoses are on the rise. Law enforcement is frantically trying to respond to the drugs proliferation in their communities. Much-needed treatment can be difficult to come by.

Addiction cuts across all cultural, racial, economic and gender lines and can have a profound impact on not only the user, but the people around him or her.

As part of a project planned for this fall by The Star-Ledger and NJ.com, we want to know how heroin or opiate addiction has affected you – whether you’re a current or former user, a friend or family member whose life has been impacted by heroin or prescription opiate abuse.

We’re hoping to collect stories of despair and struggle, hope and redemption.

If you are a current or former New Jersey resident and would like to share your story, please fill out the brief survey below. Readers who submit their stories are only asked to share their first name and those submitted will not be published until the project’s completion, which is anticipated in the coming months.

If you would be willing to talk further with a reporter, we have left users the option to submit their contact information. This is entirely optional and will never be published.

Through your stories, we hope to show the broad and deep impacts of the heroin and opiate crisis in New Jersey, from Sussex County to Cape May, Trenton to Toms River. We hope you’ll help us.

Anyone with questions or concerns can contact Stephen Stirling at sstirling@starledger.com or Ashley Peskoe at apeskoe@nj.com. Thank you for your participation.
