But do those ads really work?A survey by the online lease marketplace Swapalease.com suggests they do\u2014sometimes.Swapalease.com looked at vehicle search and consumer consideration patterns for November and December 2013. They used those metrics to determine which brands had the greatest bump in consumer interest in December versus November. The winner? Among luxury brands, Lexus appears to have the most successful campaign, with a 0.6% increase in searches and consideration in December.\u201cBased on this marketplace data, the advertising continues to work for Lexus, which operates the \u2018December to Remember\u2019 tagline in its television ads,\u201d said Scot Hall, executive vice president of Swapalease.com. \u201cIf anything, it\u2019s a little surprising to see there are several other \u2018non-luxury\u2019 brands on the list that perform better than luxury in December, especially when you combine the campaign focus and desire to gift others or yourself.\u201dIn fact, Chrysler\u2019s numbers dwarf Lexus\u2019, with a nearly 15% jump in interest. Mazda came in second (9.2%). Among luxury brands, Infiniti saw a 0.3% bump. However, other luxury brands\u2014Audi, BMW, and Mercedes-Benz each saw drops in interest.Overall, Swapalease.com\u2019s data suggest it\u2019s a popular time to lease a car. A separate report from the company found 84.2% of lease applications were approved in November, the second-highest monthly approval rate of the year. Hall said that\u2019s likely due to Americans becoming more comfortable with leases generally.\u201cLease deals will continue to rise over the next several months as car sales increase and used car values maintain their strong retention rates,\u201d Hall said. \u201cWhat\u2019s more, leasing is gaining popularity among millions of consumers who now view their car as just another monthly payment.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "As November turns to December, luxury car-makers bombard the airwaves with ads suggesting the perfect holiday gift-one with 4 wheels, leather seats, and a giant red bow on top.
