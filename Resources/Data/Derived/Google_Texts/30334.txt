However, Hispanics have still benefited overall since the enactment of the ACA, resulting in 4 million adults gaining coverage, according to the Department of Health & Human Services' March 2016 report.

According to the BEPI survey, it appears Hispanic women are increasing their access to health insurance through the ACA with 52 percent of females saying they have government healthcare coverage compared to only 23.3 percent of males.

An analysis published in late 2015 by consulting firm McKinsey & Company found premiums for the lowest-cost ACA plans are expected to increase by a median of 10-13 percent in 2016. The report also found that more than half of the government-sponsored nonprofit insurance co-ops have now failed, leaving more than 750,000 families and individuals scrambling for new health insurance.

"The increased healthcare costs compared to last year is probably making it harder for Hispanics to afford health insurance," said Monica Escaleras, Ph.D., director of the BEPI.

Political partisanship appeared to play a part in influencing respondents' opinions on healthcare topics. Republicans and Independents were significantly more likely (50 and 53 percent, respectively) to think it was harder to afford health insurance as compared with Democrats (41 percent).

Overall, 51 percent of Hispanics gave Obamacare a favorable rating, compared with 35 percent unfavorable.

The poll was conducted nationally April 1-30.
