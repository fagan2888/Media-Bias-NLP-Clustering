Both firms have always sought the uncontested right to call themselves the premier \u201cWall Street\u201d bank. In the 1980s, they were battling the likes of Dean Witter, or, flush from their success turning junk bonds into a mainstream investment product, Drexel Burnham Lambert.\n\nRelated: A New No. 1 Among Big U.S. Banks\n\nIn the 1990s, they warred with technology-focused investment banks on the West Coast \u2014 Hambrecht & Quist, Robertson Stephens \u2014 as well as the array of well-capitalized European and U.S. banks greedily eyeing the money to be made from investment banking and trading, from Credit Suisse to Citigroup, in the process of being born. But their primary rival was always each other.\n\nThey fought over who would underwrite hot IPOs (and if one had been chosen to do a deal, the other would sometimes refuse to participate.) They squabbled over hiring top recruits from business schools, and the buzz went around in philanthropic circles that one sure way to boost the size of your donation from one firm was to plant a rumor that the other planned to make a sizeable gift. They even tried to one-up each other over the date on which they released their earnings.\n\nBut the most recent batch of financial results from both banks, released last week, have prompted some to wonder aloud once more whether it\u2019s time to declare the match over.\n\nThe catalyst for such a provocative action? Morgan Stanley\u2019s impressive earnings release, which included a 46 percent jump in earnings, to $1.3 billion, or 60 cents a share, handily beating analysts\u2019 forecasts that it would report profits of 55 cents a share. Morgan Stanley it also beat revenue forecasts. If you include the impact of one-time charges, the profit was actually closer to $1.9 billion.\n\nIn contrast, while Goldman Sachs also did well, it was a very relative kind of well. Goldman still depends on trading revenues more than any other bank on Wall Street, and that weighed on its second-quarter results: Its fixed-income, currency and commodities division saw net revenue drop 10 percent. The bright spot, however, was brighter than expected, as investment banking activity. IPO underwriting and advising on M&A transactions like AT&T\u2019s proposed $48.5 billion merger with DirecTV was enough to push Goldman\u2019s earnings to $4.10 a share, 5 percent above year-ago levels and a big surprise to analysts who had been forecasting a large decline in profitability.\n\nRelated: An \u2018Abhorrent\u2019 Glimpse Inside Goldman Sachs\n\nBoth earnings releases may have been positive surprises, but only one of them, Morgan Stanley\u2019s, is the result of a trend that analysts believe might be sustainable over the longer haul. That\u2019s because it\u2019s the result of a longer-term strategic shift on the part of CEO James Gorman, who realized in the aftermath of the financial crisis that the bank\u2019s business model needed to change. He doubled down on the wealth management and retail asset management businesses, and eased up on some of the firm\u2019s involvement in trading. That area, he seems to have concluded, simply didn\u2019t represent a prudent use of Morgan Stanley\u2019s capital, once adjusted for the risk, especially when contrasted with asset management.\n\nYears later, that bet is now paying off, even as Goldman Sachs struggles to cope in the low volatility, low interest rate environment that is wreaking havoc on the bottom lines of all those who make money from trading.\n\nIs it too early to brandish Gorman\u2019s hand in the air and declare victory, and send Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein back to his corner in defeat? Possibly \u2014 but this time, I think, Morgan Stanley has come closer than it has before.\n\nRelated: A Kinder, Gentler Goldman Sachs?\n\nThere have certainly been occasions when the bank was on top of the heap, such as the mid-1990s. That\u2019s when Morgan Stanley beat Goldman in the gold rush of the early Internet boom in Silicon Valley, thanks to its hiring of star technology banker Frank Quattrone.\n\nQuattrone became the first banker to open up a Silicon Valley office, within yards of all the top venture capital offices on Sand Hill Road, and parlayed his connections with those VCs into a steady stream of incredible deals, starting with Netscape. Memorably, Quattrone was the banker responsible for urging Netscape to double its IPO price the night before the deal priced, to $28: the shares soared 150 percent on their debut, and the dot-com boom was officially off and running, with Morgan Stanley poised to profit the most. Goldman Sachs, by comparison, was a latecomer to the game.\n\nBut Goldman Sachs caught up to Morgan Stanley and overtook it; by the end of the decade, it was Goldman that was the investment bank everyone wanted to join \u2014 the infamous \u201cvampire squid\u201d of Wall Street. And while both firms survived the 2008 financial crisis \u2014 the sole investment banks of their breed to do so, even though they had been forced to transform themselves into \u201creal\u201d banks \u2014 it was Goldman that roared back to life most rapidly.\n\nBy the next summer, it had reported the largest profits in its entire history, and for 2009 as a whole, Goldman reported net income of $13.39 billion. Morgan Stanley, in contrast, reported a profit of $1.15 billion \u2014 but that became a loss after taking into account write-offs and taking into consideration only the firm\u2019s continuing operations.\n\nWhat\u2019s different this time? The two firms today are possibly more different in their business model than at any other time in their history \u2014 and the gap is likely to only become wider with time. Throughout all the decades in which the two have been fierce rivals, they have essentially been fighting for bits of the same pie. It was very much a zero-sum game.\n\nRelated: $8 Million Isn\u2019t Enough: Former Goldman Trader Sues Over Bonus\n\nThat simply is no longer the case, and it may explain why we have begun to see some very unprecedented phenomena on underwriting documents, such as Morgan Stanley sharing the spotlight with Goldman Sachs on the Twitter IPO. Morgan Stanley\u2019s primary focus is on wealth management. That\u2019s where it needs to maintain and build market share and where a loss would be intolerable. For Goldman Sachs, the focus is investment banking. The rift is widening.\n\nPerhaps there won\u2019t be a victor in this long-running Wall Street feud at all. Perhaps the two old rivals will simply shake hands and sail off into the distance \u2014 in different directions.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Who\u2019s Winning the Battle of the Bulge Bracket Firms?", "title": "GS vs. MS: Who\u2019s Winning Wall Street\u2019s Battle of the Bulge Bracket?", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2014/07/22/GS-vs-MS-Who-s-Winning-Wall-Street-s-Battle-Bulge-Bracket", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/07212014_Goldman_Sachs_Morgan_Stanley_Split.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2014/07/22/GS-vs-MS-Who-s-Winning-Wall-Street-s-Battle-Bulge-Bracket", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/07212014_Goldman_Sachs_Morgan_Stanley_Split.jpg", "title": "The Fiscal Times", "card": "summary", "creator": "@SuzMcGeeNYC"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "Who\u2019s Winning the Battle of the Bulge Bracket Firms?", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda384\"", "article_summary": "Perhaps there won\u2019t be a victor in this long-running Wall Street feud at all.\nIn contrast, while Goldman Sachs also did well, it was a very relative kind of well.\nBoth firms have always sought the uncontested right to call themselves the premier \u201cWall Street\u201d bank.\nPossibly \u2014 but this time, I think, Morgan Stanley has come closer than it has before.\nMorgan Stanley it also beat revenue forecasts."}
