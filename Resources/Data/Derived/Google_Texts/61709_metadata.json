That progress is a result of people having gotten screened years before \u2014 and having precancerous polyps removed before they become cancer.\n\nThe biggest improvements were in people ages 65 and over, who are also the ones most at risk of dying from colon cancer.\n\nGiven the good news, public health officials are zeroing in on the 30 percent or so of people ages 50 to 75 who haven't been screened. That's about 23 million people.\n\nBut many of those millions have good reasons why they haven't participated, so getting them in the door is going to be a big challenge, according to Dr. Richard Wender, chief cancer control officer for the American Cancer Society.\n\n\"We know it can be done if we eliminate the barriers,\" Wender said Monday at a meeting launching the initiative in Washington, D.C. The consortium includes the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the American Cancer Society and numerous other heavy hitters in public health.\n\nCollege graduates have already hit that magic 80 percent. Massachusetts, Vermont and some other states that have made a concerted effort to remove economic barriers for screening have rates above 70 percent.\n\nBut among people without health insurance or primary care providers, fewer than half have ever been screened. Money is a big issue.\n\nInsurers are required to cover colon cancer screening under the Affordable Care Act, but they don't always cover the facility and anesthesiologist for a colonoscopy, one of three forms of cancer screening recommended by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force. Those costs can easily run more than $1,000.\n\n\"Patients come in and the first thing they want to know is, how much is it going to cost?\" Dr. Gary Wiltz, clinical director of the Teche Action Clinic in Franklin, La., said at the news conference. \"Well, the screening is free, but the surprise is if a polyp is discovered, it's an $800 cost. These are real issues with real people.\"\n\nSurprisingly, the \"ick\" factor isn't at the top of the list of reasons why people aren't getting screened, Wender told Shots. \"We've mainstreamed it,\" he says. \"We've mainstreamed having a colonoscopy. Most people know it's the prep that's annoying, but at the end of the day it's not that terrible an experience.\"\n\nStill, he acknowledges that worries about colonoscopy can still be an issue for some people. If the two other recommended forms of screening \u2014 fecal occult blood tests and sigmoidoscopy \u2014 find a problem, colonoscopy is the only way to remove a precancerous polyp. \"It's the idea that 'nobody's putting anything up there,' \" Wender says.\n\nGiven all that, hitting that 80 percent target is going to be tough, Wender admits, especially since it means also making sure that people who have been screened in the past are up to date. \"But if we work in a determined, organized, relentless way I believe it can be achieved.\"", "article_metadata": {"Rating": "General", "description": "Screening for colon cancer actually prevents the disease, but one-third of people over 50 have never been screened.
