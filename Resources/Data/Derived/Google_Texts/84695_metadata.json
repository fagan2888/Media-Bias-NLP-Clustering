There were 2,363 gang-related killings in the United States in 2012 \u2014 the highest number in six years, according to estimates from the Department of Justice.\n\nIn an effort to understand how this violence crops up in certain places, researchers from Michigan State University (MSU) took a look at the patterns in which gang slayings occur. The groundbreaking findings, published in the American Journal of Public Health, detail how gang violence generally moves in a consistent pattern over time, not unlike infectious disease. These violent crimes seem to move from one vulnerable area to the next.\n\n\"We've shown that there is a potentially systematic movement of gang-related homicides,\" lead study investigator April Zeoli, an associate professor of criminal justice at MSU, said in a press release. \"Not only that, but in the places gang homicides move into, we see other types of homicide; specifically, revenge and drug-related killings \u2014 also clustering.\u201d\n\nZeoli added that together, these findings allow for experts to better predict where gang homicides will be the most concentrated. One possible precedent of violence could be changes in gang networks.\n\nIn 2012, Zeoli and colleagues Sue Grady, Jesenia Pizzaro, and Chris Melde showed for the first time that homicide \"spreads like infectious disease.\" Similar to the flu, homicide needs a susceptible population, an infectious agent, and a vector to spread efficiently. As far as gangs are concerned, the infectious agent could be, for example, a street code \u2014 guarding one\u2019s pride at all costs. The vector, on the other hand, could be word of mouth or publicity, Zeoli said.\n\nThe study utilized police data from Newark, N.J., and included information on not only homicide, but robbery, revenge, drugs, and domestic violence. Researchers found that gang homicides occured in patterns, and that the type of homicide can have an effect on the pattern. The homicides that stemmed from domestic violence and robberies, for example, did not show signs of spreading or clustering.\n\nRevenge and drug-related homicides did seem to cluster, and they clustered in the same areas as the gang murders.\n\n\"By tracking how homicide types diffuse through communities and which places have ongoing or emerging homicide problems by type, we can better inform the deployment of prevention and intervention efforts,\" the study says.\n\nSource: Zeoli A, Pizarro J, Melde C, Grady S. \u201cModeling the Movement of Homicide by Type to Inform Public Health Prevention Efforts.\u201d American Journal of Public Health. 2015.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "gang, murders, spread, infectious, disease, reveal, patterns, could, inspire, better", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Gang violence spreads systematically, a new study finds.
