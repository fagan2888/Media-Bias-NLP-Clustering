John T. Long didn\u2019t hesitate to offer his opinion.\n\nThe Tubman-King Community Church pastor praised CEO Jeff Feasel\u2019s leadership ability during a Feb. 2 public meeting of the Halifax Health Board of Commissioners.\n\nHe urged board members to \u201ccontinue the course\u201d despite a hefty $85 million settlement this past year with the Department of Justice to resolve allegations of Medicare fraud.\n\n\u201cLike others, I came prepared to condemn the decision-making process based on the sensationalized outcomes that I read about in the newspaper,\u201d he said during a four-minute public comment. \u201cBut the more I listened, the more I learned. I\u2019ve determined for myself the process was not flawed.\u201d\n\nLong described himself as a pastor, a citizen, an advocate and an \u201cinfrequent health care consumer.\u201d\n\nWhat he didn\u2019t mention was that he was about to sign an agreement with the hospital that would pay him $60,000 plus expenses annually to become a community outreach consultant. It\u2019s a new initiative that Halifax Health\u2019s spokesman calls an effort \u201cto get out there and educate people to make the right choices in health.\u201d\n\nDuring the meeting, then-Chairman John Johnson made a motion to fire Feasel, the CEO. About a half dozen community members joined Long in supporting Feasel in their remarks. Feasel narrowly escaped the ouster attempt by a single vote.\n\nLong said he didn\u2019t mention his pending agreement because it wasn\u2019t signed until minutes after the meeting ended, and his remarks reflected his views on a community issue that he formed on his own.\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t standing up there as someone representing Halifax,\u201d Long said. \u201cI was standing up there representing the community as pastor of Tubman-King and a resident of this community.\u201d\n\nStill, his financial connection to Halifax Health caught some board members by surprise.\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t aware he was employed by the hospital,\u201d Johnson said last week. He announced his resignation after the failed ouster attempt.\n\nPREACHERS ON THE PAYROLL\n\nHalifax Health is launching a new initiative to promote healthy living and spread the message of preventive health care by hiring two prominent preachers to perform outreach work.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really about finding the needs of our community and making sure we are catering to those needs,\u201d said John Guthrie, the hospital\u2019s director of corporate communications. \u201cSometimes, the best way to get to the community is through people who have a rich history and tradition of caring.\u201d\n\nThe idea is to spread the gospel of good health by engaging well-respected community leaders to speak about healthy eating, exercise and preventive care, Guthrie said.\n\nHiring Long was a collaborative decision between the marketing department and the hospital\u2019s senior management, he said.\n\nLong will earn $60,000 this year to \u201cassist in achieving strategic partnerships and initiatives,\u201d according to an agreement The News-Journal obtained through a public records request.\n\nIt was drafted on Jan. 30 and signed after Long\u2019s remarks at the Feb. 2 meeting, hospital officials said. Guthrie said the agreement had nothing to do with the reverend\u2019s remarks and was instead all about taking the message of healthy living outside the walls of the hospital and into the community.\n\nThe agreement was signed on Feb. 2 for the sake of convenience because all parties were present at the meeting, and Long has not been paid yet, Guthrie said.\n\nLong said he shaped his views during a series of town hall meetings held by the hospital last year. Despite the large settlement, hospital officials denied wrongdoing and gave their side in those meetings.\n\nThe whistleblower suit \u2014 filed in 2009 and settled last year \u2014 accused Halifax Health of illegally paying doctors and improperly billing Medicare.\n\nPart of Long\u2019s agreement requires him to remain \u201can active employed pastor with an established congregation\u201d of at least five years in Volusia County.\n\nLong said everyone in his congregation of about 250 knows of his business relationship with Halifax Health.\n\nThe agreement also bars him from contracting or working with any other health care provider without \u201cwritten consent\u201d from Halifax Health. Previously, Long worked as a \u201cfaith community liaison, \u201d a paid position, at for-profit hospice provider Vitas Healthcare, a competitor of Halifax Health.\n\nAlso, Halifax Health Hospice has hired the Rev. L. Ronald Durham, who is retiring as senior pastor of Greater Friendship Missionary Baptist Church on April 5. He will be paid $30 an hour.\n\nDurham stepped down from his pastoral role at the church and has refrained from commenting at hospital meetings. His duties will include hosting radio and television shows on healthy living, along with speaking to community groups about end-of-life care.\n\nEthically, health care providers can pay consultants to promote healthy behavior or dispense advice, but they should disclose their financial relationship, said Marshall Kapp, a professor of medical ethics and health care law at Florida State University\u2019s College of Medicine.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t eliminate conflict of interest,\u201d Kapp said. \u201cThe way you annul it is through disclosure. The people being counseled ought to know of the interest the pastor has.\u201d\n\nIn a March 6 press release sent to The News-Journal, Halifax Health officials said they had partnered with Long but did not disclose that he was a paid consultant.\n\nSome Halifax Health board members question whether Long should have been more forthcoming and transparent about his remarks at the Feb. 2 meeting.\n\nWhen Long addressed the board, Johnson had no idea of his financial interest in what was to be decided.\n\n\u201cWhen he was introduced to talk, I assumed he was a reverend at a local church,\u201d Johnson said.\n\nThe board voted 4-3 to retain Feasel.\n\nTwo board members \u2014 Dan Francati, who voted in favor of retaining Feasel, and Karen Jans, who cast a dissenting vote \u2014 also said they were not aware of Long\u2019s financial relationship with the hospital.\n\n\u201cI would hope anyone having any possible relationships of a business nature with the hospital would announce that and be forthcoming,\u201d Jans said.\n\nHospital board member Glenn Ritchey, a supporter of Feasel, said he wasn\u2019t aware of the status of the hospital\u2019s negotiations with Long, but he has known him for several years and respects him. Typically, the board is not involved in the hiring of rank-and-file employees, Ritchey said.\n\n\u201cMy observation of him has been nothing but the best,\u201d said Ritchey, former mayor of Daytona Beach. \u201cHe has a sincere devotion to this community. I am certainly happy that he is aboard.\u201d\n\nIMPROVING MIDTOWN\u2019S HEALTH\n\nBoth Long and Durham are active in Daytona Beach\u2019s largely African-American Midtown community.\n\nThe 32114 zip code that includes Midtown has been identified by the Florida Department of Health in Volusia County as having disproportionate rates of chronic disease compared with other parts of the county.\n\nLong has been active in working on health issues in the neighborhood, serving as a member of the Minority AIDS Network, among other causes.\n\nDurham said he joined Halifax Health\u2019s hospice organization in November on a part-time basis and will transition to full time after his retirement.\n\nHalifax Health\u2019s initiative will help improve the community\u2019s health, he said.\n\n\u201cThe Lord just sent this position to me,\u201d Durham said. \u201cIt\u2019s furthering my mission as a minister in so many ways. It keeps my primary focus on helping people in our city and region.\u201d\n\nThat zip code had the highest number of people signing up for subsidized health insurance made available by the Affordable Care Act, commonly referred to as Obamacare, in Daytona Beach and one of the highest numbers of any zip code in Volusia County.\n\nAs of Jan. 15, 1,574 residents of the 32114 zip code had selected a plan, according to data from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.\n\n\u201cThe Affordable Care Act is putting insurance in people\u2019s hands who haven\u2019t had it before,\u201d Guthrie said. \u201cWe need to educate them on how to use insurance effectively.\u201d\n\nHalifax Health has taken other steps to reach the Midtown community, inking an agreement with Bethune-Cookman University to collaborate on wellness initiatives.\n\nJohnnie Ponder, a resident of the Midtown community, said she appreciates that Halifax Health has taken an interest in the health of her neighborhood.\n\n\u201cA lot of African-Americans don\u2019t know about hospice and the benefits it has,\u201d said Ponder, chair of the Midtown Health Equity Action Team. \u201cThat\u2019s a good thing to bring out to the community. Halifax Health has been positive with us. They are trying, and that\u2019s a good thing.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "<span class=\"Dateline\">DAYTONA BEACH \u2014 Amid a fierce debate on the fate of Halifax Health\u2019s CEO, the Rev.
