Hobby Lobby and Conestoga Wood Specialties, a showdown over the Affordable Care Act\u2019s contraception coverage mandate. The core legal question is whether a private company can have religious rights.\n\nBut to the general public, this is seen as a showdown between employers \u2014 the evangelical Green family behind Hobby Lobby and the Mennonite Hahn family that owns the Conestoga cabinet company \u2014 and the employees\u2019 personal reproductive choices under their insurance.\n\nWhile conservatives have cast the battle as one for religious freedom, the general public may see it as a showdown over personal health choices.\n\nPublic opinion polls zeroed in on the ABC words: abortion and birth control: Must employers offer insurance coverage for contraceptive services they consider to be abortifacient (blocking a fertilized egg from implanting in the womb) if they have sincere religious objection to abortion?\n\nAnd the polls consistently find most Americans support the mandate, even when business owners object on religious grounds.\n\nThe Kaiser Health Tracking Poll, released in April, found \u201cthe public supports the requirement by a nearly 2-to-1 margin (61 percent support, 32 percent oppose).\n\nKaiser also asked specifically about requiring coverage in the Hobby Lobby scenario: Should a for-profit business owner with religious objections to birth control be subject to the requirement? Again, a majority (55 percent) said yes, they should, \u201ceven if it violates their owners\u2019 personal religious beliefs.\u201d\n\nEven so, 40 percent of respondents said for-profit companies should not be required to offer this insurance coverage \u201ceven if it means their female employees will have to pay the cost of birth control themselves.\u201d\n\nIn February 2012, when furor over the mandate first ignited, the findings were similar. A survey by the Public Religion Research Institute at the time found that 55 percent of Americans agreed \u201cemployers should be required to provide their employees with health care plans that cover contraception and birth control at no cost.\u201d\n\nResponse divided by religious lines and by gender. Favoring the requirement:\n\n* 62 percent of women, but only 47 percent of men\n\n* 61 percent of people with no religious identity\n\n* 50 percent of white mainline Protestants\n\n* 58 percent of Catholics\n\n* 38 percent of evangelical Protestants\n\nAmericans\u2019 views on the mandate may be shaped by their opinions on contraception. Gallup looked into this in May 2012, and found 89 percent of all Americans, including 82 percent of Catholics, say \u201cbirth control is morally acceptable.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s also popular. A May 2013 fact sheet from the Guttmacher Institute, which studies reproductive health and rights issues, found:\n\n* More than 99 percent of women aged 15_44 who have ever had sexual intercourse have used at least one contraceptive method.\n\n* Some 62 percent of all women of reproductive age are currently using a contraceptive method.\n\nHobby Lobby already covers all the most popularly used methods of birth control in its health plan, including pills and barrier methods such as condoms and sterilization (more than 90 percent of the methods most used by Americans, according to Guttmacher) that work by preventing conception.\n\nWhere the evangelical owners drew the line was at covering devices such as IUDs or medications such as Plan B that can work by blocking implantation of a fertilized egg in the uterus, thus preventing a successful pregnancy.\n\nBut many in the public are aware that a decision that favors Hobby Lobby would affect Catholic business owners who follow their church\u2019s teaching against artificial birth control that prevents conception as well.\n\nCopyright: For copyright information, please check with the distributor of this item, Religion News Service LLC.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "RNS-HOBBYLOBBY-POLLS, Supreme Court of the United States, United States government, Public opinion, Christianity, Religion, Hobbies, Human rights and civil liberties, Social issues, Social affairs, Religious issues, National courts, National governments, Government and politics, Courts, Judiciary, Recreation and leisure, Lifestyle", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "The U.S. Supreme Court is expected to finally issue its ruling this week in the highly anticipated case of the craft companies vs. Obamacare.", "title": "Awaiting Supreme Court\u2019s Hobby Lobby ruling, public favors contraception mandate", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/religion/awaiting-supreme-courts-hobby-lobby-ruling-public-favors-contraception-mandate/2014/06/23/af6ff752-fade-11e3-9f27-09f20b8bfd1a_story.html", "image": "https://images.washingtonpost.com/?url=https://img.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/twp-3000x1568.jpg&w=1484&op=resize&opt=1&filter=antialias", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "description": "The U.S. Supreme Court is expected to finally issue its ruling this week in the highly anticipated case of the craft companies vs. Obamacare.", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/religion/awaiting-supreme-courts-hobby-lobby-ruling-public-favors-contraception-mandate/2014/06/23/af6ff752-fade-11e3-9f27-09f20b8bfd1a_story.html", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "RNS-HOBBYLOBBY-POLLS, Supreme Court of the United States, United States government, Public opinion, Christianity, Religion, Hobbies, Human rights and civil liberties, Social issues, Social affairs, Religious issues, National courts, National governments, Government and politics, Courts, Judiciary, Recreation and leisure, Lifestyle", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "eomportal-uuid": "af6ff752-fade-11e3-9f27-09f20b8bfd1a"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2ee2\"", "article_summary": "Technically, it\u2019s Sebelius v.
