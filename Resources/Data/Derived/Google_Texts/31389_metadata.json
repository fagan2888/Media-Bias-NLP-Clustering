Betty was shocked find out she was going to pay $700 more for her insurance under Obamacare. Except, not really.\n\nIt seems that Betty didn\u2019t bother actually checking the Obamacare Web site to see how much the plans actually cost, and to see if she was eligible for a subsidy.\n\nYou see, it was a matter of a principle for Betty, a woman who decided to complain about how expensive Obamacare is without actually checking how expensive Obamacare actually is.\n\nYes, principle.\n\nThe second half of Colbert\u2019s takedown includes average American Joe from Louisiana, Chuck Duprey. Who is actually famed British actor, Patrick Stewart, of \u201cStar Trek\u201d fame (among many other things).\n\nPatrick Stewart is just so great.\n\nFollow @aravosis\n\n(I\u2019m told that in order to better see my Facebook posts in your feed, you need to \u201cfollow\u201d me.)", "article_metadata": {"description": "Actor Patrick Stewart poses as \"real Louisianan Chuck Duprey\" who shares his \"absolutely-true\" fake Obamacare horror story on Stephen Colbert's show.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "AMERICAblog News", "description": "Actor Patrick Stewart poses as \"real Louisianan Chuck Duprey\" who shares his \"absolutely-true\" fake Obamacare horror story on Stephen Colbert's show.", "title": "Louisianan Chuck Duprey (aka Patrick Stewart) devastated by Obamacare", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://americablog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/patrick-stewart-obamacare-colbert1.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-03-06T18:58:06-04:00", "url": "http://americablog.com/2014/03/louisianan-chuck-duprey-aka-patrick-stewart-debunks-fake-obamacare-horror-stories.html", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Actor Patrick Stewart poses as \"real Louisianan Chuck Duprey\" who shares his \"absolutely-true\" fake Obamacare horror story on Stephen Colbert's show.", "creator": "@aravosis", "image": "http://americablog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/patrick-stewart-obamacare-colbert.jpg", "title": "Louisianan Chuck Duprey (aka Patrick Stewart) devastated by Obamacare", "site": "@americablog", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "p": {"domain_verify": "6a65cadbb06b6a8cd2795a412c36d6b4"}, "fb": {"admins": 504024627}, "google-site-verification": "LrdwJVMR_suty6YsOZ4xc1Hv3-F8Ms0Wo-VhCAoXm_U", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/AMERICAblog", "published_time": "2014-03-06T18:57:39-04:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/aravosis", "section": "News", "modified_time": "2014-03-06T18:58:06-04:00", "tag": "Video"}, "news_keywords": "Affordable Care Act, Colbert Report, Obamacare, Patrick Stewart, Stephen Colbert, Video"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda2e5\"", "article_summary": "You see, it was a matter of a principle for Betty, a woman who decided to complain about how expensive Obamacare is without actually checking how expensive Obamacare actually is.\nIt seems that Betty didn\u2019t bother actually checking the Obamacare Web site to see how much the plans actually cost, and to see if she was eligible for a subsidy.\nWho is actually famed British actor, Patrick Stewart, of \u201cStar Trek\u201d fame (among many other things).\nStephen Colbert did a great takedown of the faux Obamacare horror stories the Republicans keep putting out there, and that keep getting shot down.\nBetty was shocked find out she was going to pay $700 more for her insurance under Obamacare."}
