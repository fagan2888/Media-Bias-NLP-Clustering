Jay Leno took some more shots at the current White House resident Friday.

During his opening monologue, the NBC Tonight Show host likened Redskins quarterback Robert Griffin III to President Obama saying, “He had a great first year in Washington, he showed incredible promise, then the whole thing fell apart” (video follows with transcript and commentary):

JAY LENO: The Washington Redskins have benched RGIII, quarterback Robert Griffin III. Well, he had a great first year in Washington, he showed incredible promise, then the whole thing fell apart. To which President Obama said, "Tell me about it." [Light laughter] You know, I'm just, I'm just, I'm telling you what he said, no. [Applause]

Well, this week, as you know, this week President Obama attended Nelson Mandela's memorial service in South Africa. Hundreds of world leaders were there. And President Obama said it felt strange to listen to these world leaders in person rather than eavesdropping on their phone calls. [Laughter] To actually see them talk. It's just so, so odd. [Applause]

Oh, and listen to this. A right-wing Texas congressman - is there any other kind? - has said, a guy named U.S. Senate candidate Steve Stockman, he said more people have chlamydia than have signed up for ObamaCare. That's what he said. [Light laughter] You know what ObamaCare and chlamydia have in common? You can't get either one online. [Laughter and applause] You have to, you can't. I'm just telling you.

Actually, that's not, that is not a legitimate comparison. To be fair, there's no fine for not getting chlamydia.
