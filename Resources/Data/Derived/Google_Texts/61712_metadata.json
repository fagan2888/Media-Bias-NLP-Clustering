He argues that while massive spending by outside groups has helped Democrat Mark Pryor to stay in the fight, the polls are squarely behind his opponent, Tom Cotton, who has been called the \u2018future of the GOP\u2019 by some commentators.\n\nThe 2014 Senate race between incumbent Democrat Mark Pryor and Republican Congressman Tom Cotton is very much a reflection of the national mood and broader electoral trends, yet it is also proving to be a pivotal moment in Arkansas\u2019 political history. In many ways, this race has no business being as close as it is. Democrats, like Mark Pryor, are becoming endangered species in the South.\n\nArkansas is one of the last Southern states to flip from Democratic, as part of the old Solid South, to Republican. Democrats have suffered substantial losses in recent state elections wiping away generations of dominance. Republicans captured control of both chambers of the State Legislature in 2012 for the first time since Reconstruction. Figure 1 shows that as recently as 2006, Democrats controlled more than 75 percent of the seats in both chambers.\n\nFigure 1 \u2013 Percent of the State Legislature Controlled by Democrats\n\nRepublicans are asserting their dominance in Arkansas in national elections as well. Since 2012, Republicans have controlled and are generally favored to continue to hold all four seats in Congress. In 2010, moderate incumbent Senator Democrat Blanche Lincoln lost to Republican John Boozman by more than 20 percent. President Obama performed well behind other Democratic candidates in both 2008 and 2012, losing both elections by more than 20 percent, as shown in Figure 2. Whether this is due to Obama\u2019s race or changing demographics in Arkansas as suggested in a recent New York Times piece, it is clear that the clock is ticking on Democrats\u2019 ability to win statewide elections in the near future.\n\nFigure 2 \u2013 Percentage of the Vote Received by Democratic Presidential Candidates in Arkansas\n\nWhy is this race close? The Pryor and Cotton campaigns, as well as outside groups, have spent more than $50 million on this race thus far. Arkansas has been exposed to an onslaught of ads unlike anything in recent memory as most elections in the state are rarely competitive. The Pryor campaign aired their first ad more than a year and a half before the election. Both sides have effectively used an early and consistent barrage of ads to frame the election as a choice for voters.\n\nOn paper, Pryor is the archetype for success for Democrats to have any sort of future in states like Arkansas. He is moderate Democrat with a strong family lineage in Arkansas politics as the son of former Senator and Governor David Pryor. Pryor seems to excel in retail politics, the face to face interaction with everyday Arkansans that helps him overcome belonging to the party that is growing out of favor. Pryor\u2019s biggest albatross or vulnerability this election has been his party and more specifically President Obama, whose approval ratings in Arkansas lag well behind an already flaccid national average. Pryor has been cast as an out-of-touch liberal who is simply a rubber stamp for President Obama\u2019s agenda.\n\nThe Cotton campaign and independent groups have consistently reminded voters that Pryor \u201ccast the deciding vote\u201d for Obamacare and votes with President Obama \u201c90 percent of the time.\u201d For just a small sample, see here, here, here, and here. In a recent debate, Cotton managed to work President Obama into almost every one of his answers. Similar to quips against former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, Cotton\u2019s campaign has frequently followed a mantra of noun, verb, Obama. It has proved to be an effective strategy.\n\nPryor has not helped matters by trying to defend his record while running away from his party and an unpopular President. For example, Pryor released an ad touting some of the popular components of the Affordable Care Act without mentioning it or Obamacare by name \u2013 only indicating that he helped \u201cpass a law.\u201d Even though Arkansas leads all states with the largest drop in percent uninsured, more than 10 percent according to a recent Gallup poll, since the passage of the Affordable Care Act, President Obama and Obamacare remain deeply unpopular with voters.\n\nMeanwhile, Cotton has been called the \u201cfuture of the GOP\u201d by the National Journal and a \u201cconservative superstar\u201d by The Atlantic. Cotton\u2019s pedigree has drawn attention as a candidate with both a military background and an Ivy League education. His bona fide conservative credentials as a member of Congress have helped appeal to both the Tea Party activists and financial backers of the Republican Party.\n\nPryor has been successful with the help of outside groups, such as Senate Majority PAC, Patriot Majority USA, and the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, painting Cotton as a dangerous ideological extremist beholden to wealthy out-of-state interests like the Koch Brothers. At the same time, this ideological purity has provided fodder for forceful attacks on controversial votes even breaking with the rest of Arkansas\u2019 all Republican Congressional delegation on issues such as the farm bill, medical and disaster relief, and student loans. As a result, the conservative, yet pragmatic, voters of Arkansas have been slow to warm to Cotton.\n\nOf the total $50 million spent on this race, more than $35 million of that has come from outside groups. Groups supporting Cotton have outspent groups supporting Pryor by a 2 to 1 margin. Democratic and liberal groups have spent almost all of their money exclusively attacking Congressman Cotton. This Republican and conservative advantage in money has allowed Cotton to receive both positive messages supporting his candidacy and attacking Pryor. Pryor, meanwhile, has been forced to play defense the whole election. While the \u201cbest defense may be a good offense\u201d for the Pryor campaign, it has been an uphill fight to win due to an unpopular party and President.\n\nFigure 3 \u2013 Campaign Spending by Candidates and Outside Groups\n\nAs the election nears, the dynamics clearly are in place for a Cotton victory. Polling has not shown Pryor with any sort of lead since September, and more recent polls are showing Cotton with an advantage outside of the margin of error. Pryor and the Democrats\u2019 best hope is that turnout will be surprisingly high. Only 48 percent of registered Arkansas voters turned out in 2006 and 2010, the last two midterm elections. Democrats hope that a ballot initiative to raise the minimum wage might mobilize and boost turnout among traditional Democratic constituencies. The initiative is expected to pass easily based on widespread support. Democrats also received a boost when the state\u2019s stringent photo identification law was unanimously struck down recently by the State Supreme Court.\n\nThe Cotton-Pryor race has been more contested and expensive than any race in either of those cycles. Both sides have been trading well-financed punches for more than year with the help of powerful out-of-state forces. Pryor is the ideal type of candidate for Democrats in Arkansas, yet it seems likely that an increasingly unpopular President and a party that has fallen out of favor with most state voters may be too much to overcome.\n\nThis article is part of USAPP\u2019s expert commentary on key 2014 Senate midterm races.
