They spent the seven hours they had with Willa Rose holding her, allowing friends and family to hold her, taking pictures and celebrating her short life.\n\nA short while later, they hosted a funeral for Willa Rose.\n\n\u201cAn unborn baby is a baby, and that is a life,\u201d Sara says in the video produced by husband-and-wife cinematography duo The McKellars. \u201cThey have worth and value. Losing a child is so terrible and so hard.\u201d\n\nSara and Billy Jack, or BJ, met at a small college in Colorado. After getting married and moving to Texas three years ago, they began dreaming of the family they would build.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve learned of thorns in roses. We\u2019ve watched you learn to know them, too. And we pray your fear melts in the fragrance. And we thank God for you.\u201d \u2014A. Osenga // we\u2019ll be celebrating our sweet Willa girl tomorrow at 6:30p at holly springs cemetery in martin\u2019s mill. we\u2019d love for anyone who can make it to come share this time with us. and please bring roses. // County Road 4403 & FM 1653 Ben Wheeler, TX 75754 United States A photo posted by @billyjackbrawner3 on Jul 1, 2014 at 6:03pm PDT\n\nWhen Sara found out she was expecting, they moved out of their downtown loft and began construction on a suburban home away from the city, nestled in the woods and filled with stylized flea market finds\u2014designed and ready for the baby they hoped to bring home soon.\n\nThey had planned for Sara to stay home with the baby while BJ took up work building homes with his father.\n\nWhile the death of Willa is a grief they never could have imagined, the Brawners have found hope and joy in their faith. Christians, they believe Willa has caused a \u201csweetness\u201d and a \u201cunity\u201d to blossom in their marriage.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019d think it would be a really hard memory,\u201d BJ says. \u201cBut it was all truly sweet. We loved those days.\u201d\n\n\u201c[Sara] grieves Willa\u2019s death with such grace,\u201d BJ added in a photo posted to Instagram.\n\nwe were getting pumped to share the news of baby Brawner no.4 but the sonogram shows that he/she isn\u2019t growing. it\u2019s easy for us to feel sorry for ourselves and to be resentful and to even feel numb; so our hope is that God would give us grace to mourn well the loss of this precious life, with hope and peace. // maybe the angriest i\u2019ve ever been is a couple nights ago when sk was in a lot of pain and her doctor had us go the ER, fearing it might be ectopic (thankfully, it wasn\u2019t). on our drive there, she got two phone calls from two different social workers asking us if we\u2019d be willing to foster two different sets of siblings who\u2019d been abused/neglected. since becoming foster parents, we daily (literally daily) get those kinda calls. these past couple months have been heavy because we\u2019re constantly seeing how broken our world is. it\u2019s a heavy thing to tuck someone else\u2019s kid into bed in Willa\u2019s room each night. because our world is broken, Willa is dead. because our world is broken, our little buddy isn\u2019t living with his mom and dad. because we are broken, we struggle with anger and fear and selfishness and we tend towards thinking that we\u2019re stronger and more important than we really are. but seeing the brokenness, in the world and in ourselves, makes us more ready and more hopeful for what\u2019s to come, for when all things will be made new. and so we say come, Lord Jesus. and until then give us grace to believe you\u2019ll come. (btw 1: sk is a baller. btw 2: it feels difficult to communicate this without looking like the victim or looking like the hero. we are neither. just like you, we are broken pieces that make up this broken world. just like you, we\u2019re longing for things to be made right) A photo posted by @billyjackbrawner3 on Jul 10, 2015 at 4:43pm PDT\n\nThis past weekend, the family celebrated \u201cWilla Day.\u201d They gathered with family and friends to eat, sing and \u201cread words that point back to the goodness of God in the midst of heartache.\u201d\n\nIn honor of Willa, the couple also raised money to cover medical costs for a friend\u2019s child, who was born with a rare genetic disease.\n\nSince losing Willa Rose, BJ and Sara have conceived and lost two more babies. The couple, along with their dog Lloyd, are currently fostering a little boy.\n\nThey hope to one day adopt.", "article_metadata": {"description": "When Billy Jack and Sara Brawner found out they were pregnant in November 2013, they were overjoyed.
