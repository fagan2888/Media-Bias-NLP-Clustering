She can\u2019t remember whether she has grandchildren and has no memory of her nine-hour journey to leave behind her home in Germany.\n\nSuffering from dementia, the former translator, now wheelchair-bound, celebrated her 94th birthday in a Polish nursing home. Her daughter sent her there in a bid for a better life and more affordable care.\n\nMiskulin has joined the vanguard of a controversial movement: emigrant nursing home residents.\n\nThe \u201cGrandma export\u201d trend has set hands wringing in Germany, where Munich\u2019s leading newspaper denounced it as \u201cgerontologic colonialism\u201d and compared it to nations exporting their trash. Yet more families like Miskulin\u2019s say it\u2019s their best option to provide a dignified old age for elderly parents \u2014 and save money \u2014 amid a lack of affordable quality care at home.\n\nOne in five Germans would now consider going abroad for a nursing home, according to a March survey by TNS Emnid, one of Germany\u2019s biggest pollsters.\n\n\u201cI can only say, children, when your parents get older, send them to Poland,\u201d said Miskulin\u2019s 66-year-old daughter, Ilona von Haldenwang.\n\nGermany\u2019s migrating seniors are an early warning sign of a challenge of global proportions. As birth rates drop, life expectancies increase and the baby boomer generation heads into old age, the United Nations estimates the world\u2019s population of people older than 60 will more than triple to almost 2 billion by 2050.\n\nMeanwhile, even for seniors cushioned by government aid in countries like Germany, the cost of nursing home care is rapidly becoming prohibitive. German spending on long-term care for seniors is expected to increase from 1.4 percent of gross domestic product to 3.3 percent of GDP by 2060, the European Commission said in a report last year.\n\nMiskulin\u2019s new home is in a picturesque Polish ski resort called Szklarska Poreba, which roughly translates to Glassmaking Clearing, named for the many glassworks that once defined the area. Her daughter chose the nursing home sight unseen after studying its website and meeting with a nursing-home placement broker.\n\nWhat began as an act of desperation \u2014 exporting her own mother \u2014 quickly began to make sense.\n\nFor four years, Von Haldenwang watched with increasing despair as her mother\u2019s health deteriorated in what she says was a poorly run German facility, even as it strained the women\u2019s finances.\n\nNow, at about a third the price for the care she received in Germany, Sonja lives in a restored century-old luxury villa where she enjoys fine meals, around-the-clock nursing and extensive physical therapy.\n\nMiskulin is adjusting to her new surroundings. Still, the trade-off for both mother and daughter is the 350 miles separating them. The two women used to live only a two-minute walk apart. Von Haldenwang recalls the friend who helped move her mother protesting in disbelief as they climbed into the fir-covered Karkonosze Mountains that mark Poland\u2019s border with the Czech Republic.\n\n\u201cOh God, oh God, where are we going? It\u2019s the end of the earth,\u201d she remembered her friend saying. \u201cThen we drove up the hill and she said, 'Oh! It\u2019s a palace!\u2019 And I said, 'See, I told you, everything will be good.' \u201d\n\nThe owners say half the residents will soon be Germans, who have state-mandated long-term care insurance through a nearly 20-year-old program, a benefit out of the reach of most people beyond Europe, including the United States.\n\nThe insurance pays out 1,550 euros ($2,060) a month to German citizens who need the highest level of care. That\u2019s less than half of the 3,250-euro average monthly bill for such care inside Germany. Nursing homes in Poland are marketing care that in some cases may be similar or better for about 1,200 euros a month.\n\nThe German government will pay as much as 700 euros toward nursing care outside the country. Though less than half the amount provided for in-country homes, it\u2019s enough, together with pensions, to pay for monthly care costs \u2014 with cash to spare.\n\nThe arithmetic is compelling for older Germans and their grown children. Ingrid Fetz, 74, did the math after four back operations got her thinking about her financial vulnerability. In Poland, Fetz said she figures she would have money left over each month after paying for her care costs.\n\n\u201cI worked so hard for what I have,\u201d said Fetz. \u201cIt would break my heart to give my apartment to a nursing home someday. I thought to myself, why would I have to stay in Germany at all?\"", "article_metadata": {"wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}, "description": "Amid soaring costs for care, more look outside nation's borders for long-term options"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd320d\"", "article_summary": "The \u201cGrandma export\u201d trend has set hands wringing in Germany, where Munich\u2019s leading newspaper denounced it as \u201cgerontologic colonialism\u201d and compared it to nations exporting their trash.\nThe German government will pay as much as 700 euros toward nursing care outside the country.\n\u201cI can only say, children, when your parents get older, send them to Poland,\u201d said Miskulin\u2019s 66-year-old daughter, Ilona von Haldenwang.\nMeanwhile, even for seniors cushioned by government aid in countries like Germany, the cost of nursing home care is rapidly becoming prohibitive.\nIn Poland, Fetz said she figures she would have money left over each month after paying for her care costs."}
