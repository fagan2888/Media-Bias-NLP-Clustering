The New York Police Department is too busy to search for a Columbia University professor’s missing son, thanks to all the police-abuse demonstrators, according to a report in the Daily Mail.

Bruce Robbins said his son Andreas has been missing since Monday night, when he left a suicide note saying he was going to jump off the George Washington Bridge and leaving his apartment without his phone or bank card.

Mr. Robbins said police were initially helpful but he was told after the grand-jury refusal to indict a policeman in the chokehold death of Eric Garner prompted continues street protests and “die-ins” that they are now too busy.

“I was kind of speechless,” Mr. Robbins told the Daily Mail. “A detective basically said, ‘There’s no one out to take your case because everyone is out there dealing with the consequences of the Eric Garner case.’”

According to the Daily Mail, “officers say they have been ‘working diligently’ to find Mr Robbins as they sent out harbour and aviation units as well as canvassing around his neighborhood.”
