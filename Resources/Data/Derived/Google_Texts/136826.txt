Parking lot of Side Pockets

It has been confirmed by the police that the man who fell off of a moving vehicle and hit his head was, indeed, 19-years-old.

Police made an error in reporting the age of the teen as 28-years-old during a briefing and told KAKE News early Sunday morning that his reported age was correct the first time.

As of early Sunday morning the teen's condition is still critical.

Investigators have located the driver of the Pontiac and part of an ongoing investigation into the incident is to determine if the 19-year-old was inside the drinking establishment.

It is unknown if he had been drinking before spending time at Side Pockets.

A split-second decision while horse playing in a parking lot, puts a teen's life in jeopardy.

Police say a group of people had been together at the Side Pockets bar in the 600 block of South Tyler. As they left, a 19-year-old apparently jumped on to the back of a moving car. He fell off, hitting his head on the pavement.

He was taken to the hospital with what police are calling extremely critical injuries.

"We're waiting word from the hospital to see what his prognosis truly is," said Sergeant Jim Merrick. "Head injuries can be tricky, a fall on pavement can sometimes be fatal."

Police say it appears alcohol was a factor. The car involved left the scene.
