Friday, after the Supreme Court unilaterally made gay marriage the law of the land, President Obama made a statement from the White House that included this lie:

SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

I know that Americans of good will continue to hold a wide range of views on this issue. Opposition, in some cases, has been based on sincere and deeply held beliefs. All of us who welcome today’s news should be mindful of that fact and recognize different viewpoints, revere our deep commitment to religious freedom.

In other words, “If you like your religion, you can keep your religion.”

This statement from our president is no truer than his lie during the ObamaCare debate about being able to keep your doctor and insurance under ObamaCare.

Obama knew he was lying then. Obama knows he is lying now about protecting religious freedom.

Legalizing same sex marriage was not the endgame for the Left — it is in fact the creation of a weapon that will now be used to marginalize, punish, terrorize, and decimate the Christian religion, its practitioners, and the Church itself.

The small business owners and CEOs already targeted for extinction by the Left are just the beginning.

Churches that refuse to perform same sex weddings will not only be relentlessly shamed as bigots by the left and their allies in the mainstream media, their tax-exempt status will be also challenged; their ability to perform public services will be extinguished. The media is smoothing this jihad, but it is already happening.

Naturally, the government will take religion’s place.

Obama can sing “Amazing Grace,” but he doesn’t believe a word of it.

Obama’s a proven liar, and his comments about respecting religion are a tactical move to get us to take down our guard.
