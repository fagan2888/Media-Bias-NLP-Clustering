First it was the deer tick giving us a bacterial infection known as Lyme disease; now there\u2019s a tick that can make us severely allergic to red meat. Are you ticked off yet?\n\nThis time we can blame the lone star tick, which used to hang out in its namesake state, Texas, and the southeastern U.S. Today, though, it\u2019s spreading to the East Coast and other parts of the country.\n\nThe tick carries a sugar that human bodies don\u2019t have. The sugar, called alpha-gal (short for galactose-alpha-1,3-galactose), naturally occurs in red meat and some dairy products. Normally, it just gets digested along with your food, but when the lone star tick injects the sugar into your bloodstream, your body\u2019s immune system goes into overdrive.\n\n>> Sign up for the AARP Health Newsletter\n\nThe immune system produces antibodies to fight off this unwelcome substance, so that the next time you eat a juicy steak or your favorite burger, your body reacts in the same way it would if you had a life-threatening peanut allergy: Tissues become inflamed, and the throat swells shut, cutting off the airway.\n\nLouise Danzig, a 63-year-old retired nurse from Montauk, on eastern Long Island, told the Associated Press that hours after eating a burger, \u201cI could feel my lips and tongue were getting swollen.\u201d By the time she made a phone call for help, her symptoms had worsened significantly. \u201cI was losing my ability to speak and my airway was closing,\u201d she said.\n\nA blood test confirmed the meat allergy. \u201cI\u2019ll never have another hamburger, I\u2019m sure,\u201d Danzig said.\n\nIt took a while for doctors to realize that this sudden, mysterious meat allergy was tied to a tick bite.\n\nThe discovery was first detailed in a 2012 report by Scott Commins, M.D., and Thomas Platts-Mills, M.D., both allergy and immunology experts with the University of Virginia Health System.\n\nThe authors noted that 24 cases of this reaction had been reported in 2009. By 2010, \u201cit was obvious that the cases should be counted in hundreds rather than dozens,\u201d they wrote, and by 2012, \u201cit was clear that there are thousands of cases across a large area of the southern and eastern U.S.\u201d\n\nNow, \u201cI see two to three new cases every week,\u201d Commins told the AP. Erin McGintee, M.D., an allergy specialist on eastern Long Island, an area with many ticks, has seen nearly 200 cases over the past three years.\n\n>> Get travel discounts with your AARP Member Advantages.\n\nUnlike a typical food allergy, which causes a reaction almost immediately after eating, the tick-related reaction can occur several hours later. In some cases, taking antihistamines, such as Benadryl (diphenhydramine), can help, but in other cases, where the reaction is more critical, a shot of epinephrine is needed. Some patients have begun carrying EpiPens with them.\n\nCommins and Platts-Mills wrote that dairy products can also trigger a reaction, and that fattier meats as well as large portions of beef, lamb or pork \u2013 in other words, any meat from a mammal \u2013 tend to produce more severe reactions. Even poultry products, such as turkey sausage, sometimes contain meat by-products and can trigger the allergy, the experts said.\n\nThe allergy may not be lifelong, but as Commins pointed out to the AP, \u201cthe caveat is, additional tick bites bring it back.\u201d\n\nTop photo: magnetcreative/iStock; lone star tick: courtesy CDC.gov\n\nAlso of Interest\n\nSee the AARP home page for deals, savings tips, trivia and more", "article_metadata": {"page_title": "blog", "twitter": {"description": "Those damn ticks.
