The change affects 101,431 customers.\n\nThat average monthly price will be $80.40 in the former Maine Public Service area, which includes 30,225 residential customers.\n\nThough parent company Emera merged the two utilities as Emera Maine at the beginning of 2014, the company still manages rates separately for the two coverage areas.\n\nThose Maine Public Service region rates dropped mostly because of rising transmission revenues and decreases in stranded costs, partly as a result of about $4 million Emera received from the settlement of litigation between Maine Yankee, of which it was a 5 percent owner, and the U.S. Department of Justice.\n\nThe changes reflect increases the company requested to the distribution portion of customers\u2019 bills and were based on an annual revenue requirement of about $80.1 million and $1.2 million in storm damage costs in the past year. The approved increase also includes funds for Emera to cover costs of a new customer information system to go into service on Aug. 1, 2014.\n\nThe last distribution rate increase in the Bangor Hydro district was in 2008.
