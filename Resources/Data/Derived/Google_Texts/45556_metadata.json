Many non-American see the U.S. position that unless our governmental observers can see everything that goes on in another country its procedures must be suspect as bordering on the arrogant.\n\nIt is easy enough for those of us in the West to expect other countries facing very different problems to live up to our standards. There are bad actors out there, of course, but we sometimes forget that others are doing their best under circumstances that we don\u2019t have to overcome. Sometimes we might consider cutting our friends a little slack when they are from all available evidence improving as their democracies mature. All too often, when we don\u2019t like what\u2019s going on we start talking not about working with our friends toward meaningful reform but about \u201cregime change.\u201d\n\nIn some, but certainly not all cases such talk is legitimate, but such talk while cloaked in the rhetoric of morality is usually about something else. Henry Kissinger was fond of quoting Britain\u2019s Lord Palmerston who once famously observed that nation don\u2019t have permanent friends and allies, but only permanent interests.\n\nPerhaps we should also remember Edmund Burke\u2019s observation that \u201ca foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of small minds,\u201d but ask ourselves whether such criticism from a State Department that is wont to apply very different moral standards to the activities of the U.S. government than to the actions of others is foolish. After all, the same State Department that has been so critical of Azerbaijan applauded the selection of Saudi Arabia to lead the U.N. Human Rights Council. That\u2019s Saudi Arabia \u2014 one of the most repressive regimes in the world, whose levels of intolerance are codified to the extent that the only religion allowed is Islam. All else can be punishable by death.\n\nThis is the same State Department that called Israel\u2019s accidental bombing of a UNRWA school during the defensive Gaza war \u201cdisgraceful\u201d prior to any investigation having taken place and despite the fact that terrorists were firing from the school. And then just a couple of months ago, when U.S. forces destroyed a Doctors Without Borders hospital killing over 20 people, refused to use the same language, instead pleading for time to conduct investigations.\n\nAnd this is also the same State Department that has been silent about the lack of elections in the Palestinian territories, where the term of Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas expired in 2009 and which criticizes Azerbaijan\u2019s lack of press freedom while standing silent while a Palestinian, Anas Ismail, is sentenced to six months in jail by the Palestinian Authority for \u2018liking\u2019 a Facebook page critical of the Palestinian president.\n\nThe State Department may sometimes think of itself as a moral judge on world affairs, but clearly it isn\u2019t. This is not to deny that Azerbaijan and nations in a similar position don\u2019t face challenges in regard to press freedom and human rights, but their actions need to be viewed in the context of their geopolitical position.\n\nAzerbaijan, for example, recently emerged from a totalitarianism few of us in the West can even begin to understand. When Azerbaijan first gained independence, many there didn\u2019t know how the country would survive. They were fully dependent on Russia. They weren\u2019t able to afford grain, had no foreign reserves \u2014 and had, in fact, nothing of their own. One can only marvel at the progress made since then.\n\nCan things improve in Azerbaijan \u2014 of course they can. It\u2019s far from a perfect country, but we need to recognize that countries differ based on history, culture and their surrounding geopolitical environment. It is unrealistic to expect the same level of progress from each of them. The Arab Spring was hailed as a new era for freedom and democracy, but instead of turning the Arab world into one of opportunity and hope, it has left it in anarchy and despair, because many of the nations throwing off one group of despots had not developed the infrastructure to prevent another from taking over.\n\nAzerbaijan is developing that infrastructure and a strong enough civil society to make those who follow what\u2019s going on their hopeful. While ethnic tensions have always been high in the region, Azerbaijan remains an extremely tolerant country toward different ethnicities and religions. Jews, for example, are more secure in Muslim Azerbaijan today than in most European countries. The same cannot be said of other nations that somehow escape State Department condemnation.\n\nInstead of solely focusing on how far nations like Azerbaijan have to go, it might be prudent to consider how far they\u2019ve come.\n\n\u2022 Justin Amler is an Australia-based writer and commentator on international issues who specializes on the Middle East, Eurasia and the former Soviet Union.", "article_metadata": {"description": "On November 1, Azerbaijan's ruling New Azerbaijan Party won 70 of a 125 seats in that country's parliament in an election largely boycotted by the main opposition party.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "On November 1, Azerbaijan\u2019s ruling New Azerbaijan Party won 70 of a 125 seats in that country\u2019s parliament in an election largely boycotted by the main opposition party.", "title": "JUSTIN AMLER: State Department should consider Azerbaijan\u2019s progress", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/nov/29/justin-amler-state-department-should-consider-azer/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/11/28/Belarus_Azarbaijan.JPEG-050d3.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/11/28/Belarus_Azarbaijan.JPEG-050d3.jpg", "description": "On November 1, Azerbaijan's ruling New Azerbaijan Party won 70 of a 125 seats in that country's parliament in an election largely boycotted by the main opposition party.", "card": "summary", "title": "JUSTIN AMLER: State Department should consider Azerbaijan\u2019s prog"}, "Author": "Justin Amler", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Politics, Azerbaijan"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fccf00\"", "article_summary": "The State Department may sometimes think of itself as a moral judge on world affairs, but clearly it isn\u2019t.\nThe same cannot be said of other nations that somehow escape State Department condemnation.\nAfter all, the same State Department that has been so critical of Azerbaijan applauded the selection of Saudi Arabia to lead the U.N.
