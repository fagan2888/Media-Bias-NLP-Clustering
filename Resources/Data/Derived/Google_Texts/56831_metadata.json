The principals are thought to have approved the invoices in return for bribes and kickbacks from Shy.\n\n\u201cIt is extremely disappointing when greed and selfishness deteriorate the communities and future possibilities of our youth,\u201d Koopman said.\n\nKoopman and Dave Gelios, special agent in charge at the FBI\u2019s Detroit field office, conducted the investigation that uncovered what they said was $2.7 million in fraudulent invoices.\n\nShy and Clara Flowers, the school district\u2019s assistant superintendent for specialized student services and former principal of Henderson Academy, also were charged with tax evasion.\n\n\u201cHere we have yet another problem to add to the litany of issues emanating from Detroit public schools,\u201d Lindsey Burke, The Heritage Foundation\u2019s Will Skillman fellow in education policy, told The Daily Signal in an email, adding:\n\nThese significant allegations of corruption add to a long list of problems: Just 8 percent of Detroit public school eighth-graders can read proficiently, according to the National Assessment of Educational Progress; just 3 percent are proficient in math. Fewer than seven in 10 students graduate.\n\nState Rep. Sherry Gay-Dagnogo, D-Detroit, told The Daily Signal in a phone interview that she is \u201cvery disappointed\u201d by the charges. Gay-Dagnogo said she began her own career in Detroit public schools under one of the officials named in the indictment.\n\n\u201cJust to hear [about the indictments], at the time when we are in the biggest fight of our lives to sustain the Detroit public schools \u2026 it was just a gut punch,\u201d the former teacher added.\n\nThe same day U.S. Attorney Barbara L. McQuade announced the bribery indictments, Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder, a Republican, signed legislation allocating $48.7 million in emergency funding to the school system.\n\n\u201cThere are definitely questions now,\u201d Gay-Dagnogo said of the funds.\n\nMichigan House Speaker Kevin Cotter, R-Mt. Pleasant, said the corruption charges only made Republicans more anxious for reforms.\n\n\u201cLocal officials in Detroit want more power and a handout from the state,\u201d Cotter said in a formal statement. \u201cBut House Republicans want assurances that nothing like this can ever happen again. Serious financial and academic reforms, including state oversight, must be enacted in Detroit before one more dollar is spent trying to prop up this failing district.\u201d\n\nGay-Dagnogo said fiscal oversight alone, such as through an emergency manager, has not improved the school system because schools stay the same internally.\n\n\u201cWe need increased transparency, shared responsibility, and we need to take a look at what\u2019s actually taking place,\u201d she told The Daily Signal.\n\nHeritage\u2019s Burke recommended expanding education options:\n\nInstead of consigning poor children to the public schools within Detroit, families should have options in where and how their dollars are spent. Funds should follow a child to any school of choice, enabling families to find options that match their children\u2019s unique learning needs, and increasing transparency in education spending.\n\nExamining Michigan\u2019s Blaine Amendment would be a good place for lawmakers to start, Burke said. The amendment, originally designed to prevent funding from going to \u201csectarian\u201d schools, is now used to prevent public funding from following students to religious schools of their choice.\n\nBen DeGrow, director of education policy at the Michigan-based Mackinac Center for Public Policy, told The Daily Signal in an email that he recommends a student-based budgeting system, basic financial controls, and getting districts out of costly union and vendor contracts, among other reforms.\n\n\u201cThe latest news of corrupt financial dealings in [Detroit public schools] provides more evidence that the district operates according to the principle of what works best for adults, rather than what works best for the students it\u2019s supposed to serve,\u201d DeGrow said, adding:", "article_metadata": {"description": "A supplies vendor conspired with 13 school officials over 12 years to submit fraudulent invoices, investigators allege.
