For example, when patrons visit the park on busier days, like in summer or over Christmas, they would have to pay more for their ticket.\n\n\u201cI support it,\u201d said Darcy Forsell, a San Mateo urban planner and Disneyland mega-fan. \u201cIt equates supply and demand.\u201d\n\nForsell takes her two daughters at least five times a year. But there are moments for her when the happiest place on earth turns into one of the most miserable.\n\n\u201cWhen it gets super crowded, I just want to leave,\u201d she says. \u201cThe lines just get to be so long.\u201d\n\nForsell says she\u2019d be willing to pay more if it meant there were fewer people she\u2019d have to compete with to get onto Space Mountain.\n\n\u201cIf pricing it a little bit higher means the demand drops, I think that\u2019s appropriate,\u201d she says.\n\nThat\u2019s exactly the idea behind a congestion pricing system Disneyland is considering now. The company sent a survey to parkgoers, and says it will review responses before making a final decision on whether to implement a new pricing plan.\n\nMark Dvorchak, managing partner at Pro Forma Advisors, a theme park economics consultancy, says the concept of surge pricing is relatively new to amusement parks, but is ubiquitous in other industries.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like getting a discount at the movie theater when you go to a matinee,\u201d he says. \u201cOr a plane flight. Friday night the ticket\u2019s more expensive and on a Tuesday afternoon, it\u2019s not.\u201d\n\nSo people who\u2019d go to Disneyland on weekdays in February or September would pay less, about $99. While people who go on holidays or during the summer would pay up to $115.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not worth it,\u201d says Becky Walley. She\u2019s lived in Pasadena all her life and takes her kids to Disneyland a few times a year. She says you could hardly pay her to go in the summer.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just too hot,\u201d she says. \u201cIt is literally so packed you can hardly move.\u201d\n\nBut Christmas? That brings back precious childhood memories.\n\n\u201cI loved all the decorations. We used to go there over Christmas and just stand there on Main Street when it started to snow. And that was foreign to us in Southern California, so it was so cool to watch that,\u201d she remembers. \u201cI think I probably would pay extra for December.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Admission to the theme park would cost more on busier days.", "contextly-page": "{\"title\":\"Disneyland Considers Surge Pricing\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/news\\/2015\\/06\\/01\\/disneyland-considers-surge-pricing\",\"pub_date\":\"2015-06-01 13:44:18\",\"mod_date\":\"2015-06-01 15:20:27\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":10547285,\"author_id\":\"3205\",\"author_name\":\"April Dembosky\",\"author_display_name\":\"April Dembosky\",\"tags\":[\"Disneyland\"],\"categories\":[\"Arts and Culture\",\"News\"],\"image\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/news\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/sites\\/10\\/2015\\/06\\/Disneyland-e1433190639826.jpg\"}", "og": {"site_name": "KQED News", "description": "Admission to the theme park would cost more on busier days.", "title": "Disneyland Considers Surge Pricing", "url": "http://ww2.kqed.org/news/2015/06/01/disneyland-considers-surge-pricing/", "image": "http://i1.wp.com/ww2.kqed.org/news/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2015/06/Disneyland-e1433190639826.jpg?fit=640%2C427", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@kqednews", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@"}, "fb": {"app_id": 160023622793}, "keywords": "disneyland", "google-site-verification": "Oam-TnlJjUP-cg8UEyR3-KcLp8_-WTy6_dBaSws1ADA", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd370e\"", "article_summary": "Disneyland is toying with the idea of surge pricing, a payment system in which prices move up or down according to demand.\nThat\u2019s exactly the idea behind a congestion pricing system Disneyland is considering now.\nMark Dvorchak, managing partner at Pro Forma Advisors, a theme park economics consultancy, says the concept of surge pricing is relatively new to amusement parks, but is ubiquitous in other industries.\nShe\u2019s lived in Pasadena all her life and takes her kids to Disneyland a few times a year.\n\u201cIf pricing it a little bit higher means the demand drops, I think that\u2019s appropriate,\u201d she says."}
