Asked about Article V of the Constitution, Kentucky GOP senate candidate Matt Bevin began talking about the Fifth Amendment at an event yesterday:

“Playground antics is all Mitch McConnell has left. Voters are turning against his big government record of raising the debt ceiling, bailing out Wall Street and now opposing efforts by Senators Lee and Cruz to defund Obamacare,” responded Bevin spokeswoman Sarah Durand.

The clip was posted online from the Mitch McConnell campaign. From a news account of the event yesterday, it appears Senator McConnell sent his campaign manager Jesse Benton to debate Bevin instead of coming himself. From Kentucky.com:
