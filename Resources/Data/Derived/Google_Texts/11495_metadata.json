Allen Sr. shortly before 3 p.m. Friday but did not reach a verdict, the Journal Sentinel (http://bit.ly/1jhMHsX ) reported.\n\nAllen, 34, and the boy\u2019s mother, took their son to a West Allis hospital on Oct. 6, 2012, after a day when he wasn\u2019t eating normally and seemed lethargic. After giving a series of changing explanations of what might have injured the boy, Allen admitted he squeezed the baby too hard once, and another time shook the boy when he wouldn\u2019t stop clawing at his face.\n\nJunior was put in foster care, where his condition deteriorated until he died in April 2013. Prosecutors then charged Allen, already facing child abuse counts, with reckless homicide.\n\nThe two-week trial has highlighted uncertainty about whether \u201cshaken baby syndrome\u201d is always the only explanation for certain brain injuries in children.\n\nDefense experts who questioned both the medical basis for concluding the infant died of child abuse and the validity of Allen\u2019s confession to shaking the child earned more than $40,000 for their efforts to create \u201ca courtroom controversy,\u201d a prosecutor told a jury Friday.\n\nAssistant District Attorney Matthew Torbenson called the experts \u201cfrequent fliers\u201d who came from four states and England to \u201ccollect a paycheck\u201d while trying to raise doubt that Allen\u2019s actions led to the death of his son.\n\nTorbenson said there was no doubt that child abuse led to the boy\u2019s death. He cited diagnoses from local pediatric experts who treated David Allen Jr. at Children\u2019s Hospital of Wisconsin. He said those were corroborated by Allen\u2019s admissions about squeezing, shaking and dropping his son in the fall of 2012, just months after the boy, who was born two months prematurely, was released from intensive care.\n\nIn addition to the brain injuries, the boy had 12 broken ribs.\n\nIn the defense closing argument, attorney Anthony Cotton reminded jurors of his experts\u2019 credentials, and said they testified because there is a contentious debate in the medical community about attributing certain injuries to child abuse without more evidence than particular brain conditions.\n\n\u201cYour job isn\u2019t to reconcile that debate,\u201d Cotton told the jury.\n\nCotton summarized defense experts\u2019 findings that conditions resulting from the boy\u2019s premature birth could have caused silent seizures, resulting in bleeding near his brain, and that his ribs were so weak they could have been broken by normal handling.\n\nThe defense attorney reminded jurors there were no bruises, skull fractures or evidence that the child screamed or reacted as would be expected around the time his father later said he had squeezed the boy too hard.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, http://www.jsonline.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "Jury deliberations are expected to resume Monday in the trial of a Milwaukee man accused of physical abuse that allegedly led to the 2013 death of his infant son.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/oct/10/jury-deliberating-wisconsin-case-alleging-shaken-b/", "type": "article", "site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Jury deliberations are expected to resume Monday in the trial of a Milwaukee man accused of physical abuse that allegedly led to the 2013 death of his infant son.", "title": "Jury deliberating Wisconsin case alleging shaken baby death"}, "twitter": {"title": "Jury deliberating Wisconsin case alleging shaken baby death", "description": "Jury deliberations are expected to resume Monday in the trial of a Milwaukee man accused of physical abuse that allegedly led to the 2013 death of his infant son.", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d"}, "article_summary": "The two-week trial has highlighted uncertainty about whether \u201cshaken baby syndrome\u201d is always the only explanation for certain brain injuries in children.\nTorbenson said there was no doubt that child abuse led to the boy\u2019s death.\nIn addition to the brain injuries, the boy had 12 broken ribs.\nProsecutors then charged Allen, already facing child abuse counts, with reckless homicide.\nAfter giving a series of changing explanations of what might have injured the boy, Allen admitted he squeezed the baby too hard once, and another time shook the boy when he wouldn\u2019t stop clawing at his face."}
