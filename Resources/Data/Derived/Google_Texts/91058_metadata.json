Someone busted the front window of the business, setting off an alarm.\n\nDee Starkey is the owner of the 60-year-old business, he thinks that the store was targeted citing a suspicious man snooping around on Friday.\n\nThree student violins, four intermediate violins and one student cello were stolen; the student versions of the instruments are not as expensive as the intermediate. Some of the violins had individual values of $1,700.\n\nStarkey says the neighborhood where his business resides is usually quiet and is thankful that no one was hurt. \"We feel fortunate that no people were hurt, no guns were involved,\" he said, \"it was just stuff, it is replaceable and life will go on.\"\n\nThe suspect broke the exterior lighting of the building to mask his identity. Police do not have any suspect description or person of interest in the case.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"medium": "video", "description": "The Jim Starkey Music Center was robbed of eight instruments valued up to $10,000", "language": "english", "author": "Bryan Ramsdale", "og": {"description": "The Jim Starkey Music Center was robbed of eight instruments valued up to $10,000", "title": "Violins stolen in Wichita music store burglary", "url": "http://www.kake.com/home/headlines/Wichita-music-store-targeted-in-robbery-260546731.html", "image": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/462/BAD/462BAD3679A741F0A0DBE242CACEB969", "video": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/34D/779/34D779B13A6C4F80A898CEE9383351F1.mp4", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.kake.com", "description": "The Jim Starkey Music Center was robbed of eight instruments valued up to $10,000", "creator": "@KAKEnews", "url": "http://www.kake.com/home/headlines/Wichita-music-store-targeted-in-robbery-260546731.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/StarkeyViolin2.jpg", "title": "Violins stolen in Wichita music store burglary", "site": "@KAKEnews", "card": "summary"}, "video_type": "video/mp4", "video_height": 288, "keywords": "Violins stolen in Wichita music store burglary", "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "google-site-verification": "H0mev8O__gMqb34WcvOyZgBXFMRQZvDAQ0YTSGJ9hGQ", "video_width": 512, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Violins stolen in Wichita music"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd80e\"", "article_summary": "Three student violins, four intermediate violins and one student cello were stolen; the student versions of the instruments are not as expensive as the intermediate.\nThe Jim Starkey Music Center was robbed of eight instruments valued up to $10,000 early Saturday morning.\nDee Starkey is the owner of the 60-year-old business, he thinks that the store was targeted citing a suspicious man snooping around on Friday.\nStarkey says the neighborhood where his business resides is usually quiet and is thankful that no one was hurt.\nPolice were called to the building in the 1300 block of west 18th Street around 5:50 A.M."}
