Remember Pajama Boy? The twenty-something in a red onesie trying to sell you on the merits of ObamaCare? If he’s like others in his generation, he’s still living off mom and dad.

That’s one of the findings by Temple University’s Laurence Steinberg. In his new book, “Age of Opportunity,” Steinberg says that today’s 25-year-olds are 50 percent more likely than their parents were at the same age to be relying on their moms and dads for financial assistance.

Now, Steinberg is a psychologist, so what interests him most is the teenage brain and its relation to an increasingly prolonged adolescence.

Young Americans, he says, are taking longer and longer to move into the things we associate with adulthood: jobs that gave them independence, marriage, etc. He’s not necessarily lamenting this, saying it can have benefits such as keeping kids connected with their parents.

The economy isn’t creating the jobs that allow for self-sufficiency. Which is why some refer to this as the ‘Screwed Generation.’

But there’s an economic dimension too. Fact is, we’re living through one of the slowest and most sluggish economic recoveries in our history. That means the economy isn’t creating the jobs that allow for self-sufficiency. Which is why some refer to this as the “Screwed Generation.”

ObamaCare has become a metaphor for these struggling millennials. Thanks to Obama­Care, parents can keep their children on their health insurance until they’re 25.

It’s easy to blame the younger generations for not working as hard as their parents.

But when they’re entering an economy that’s not growing fast enough to produce the jobs they need to stand on their own, can we really blame them for living at home on mom and dad’s dime?
