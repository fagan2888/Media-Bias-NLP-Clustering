(June 2, 2014) \u2013 The Ali caregiving story is about love, companionship and devotion. It is the story of a brave spiritual couple joining hands and going the distance in a difficult fight against an insidious disease, Parkinson\u2019s. But perhaps most importantly, it is the story of a resilient woman serving as the voice, guiding light and conscience for an all-but-silenced superstar athlete and civil rights activist.\n\n\n\nIn a rare and candid interview at the couple\u2019s desert home in Phoenix, Arizona, wife Lonnie Ali opens up exclusively to AARP Bulletin about the challenges that come with caring for the man known as \u201cThe Greatest,\u201d Muhammad Ali and the impact taking on the role of caregiver has had on their relationship. Discussing everything from how the couple has dealt with Parkinson\u2019s disease over the years to building a new kind of relationship every day, Mrs. Ali offers insight into the round-the-clock life of caregivers.\n\nAs the primary caregiver of the boxing legend, Lonnie is every bit the inspiration her husband is to the more than 42 million Americans in this same role. And given newly released reports from AARP and the Associated Press, which finds that nearly two-thirds of spousal caregivers admit it causes real stress on their family, her story is one of urgency, importance and relevance to families across the nation.\n\nThe following are excerpts from the June issue of AARP Bulletin\u2019s feature story, Caring for the Champ, in homes now and available online at www.aarp.org/bulletin:\n\nOn the Impact Being a Caregiver Has Had on Their Relationship\n\n\u201cThe hardest part for any caregiver, whether it is a child, parent or spouse, is the relationship change.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe relationship changes overtime with the illness. Physically, [patients] are not as mobile; they are not able to do things with you like they used to. The medications might affect their cognitive ability. They may not be able to speak as well\u2026that is where you [transition] from a wife or a husband to a care partner or caregiver.\u201d\n\n\n\nOn Muhammad Ali\u2019s Positive Outlook\n\n\u201cI am so fortunate. I have a husband who doesn\u2019t complain about anything. He is not a moaner, a whiner or a poor-me kind of person. Muhammad has learned how to not sweat the small stuff. He is amazing that way.\u201d\n\n\u201cParkinson\u2019s has taken away a lot from this man\u2014a lot that would put people in bed, make them cover their heads and never look up. He has a lot to be depressed about\u2026But I think he is secure in who he is, and about his place in history. That\u2019s not to say that Parkinson\u2019s hasn\u2019t changed him\u2014it has. But he still has enough sense of self and dignity that he maintains.\u201d\n\n\n\nOn Dealing with Parkinson\u2019s Disease\n\n\u201cEverything now is about protecting him and making sure he is healthy\u2026When there is influenza, we don\u2019t go to movies. We don\u2019t want him exposed.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is the beauty of Muhammad. He has made this illness, as horrible as it is, as much as it has taken away from him, serve him in some way.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf there was ever anyone who always lands on his feet and comes out smelling like a rose, it is Muhammad. It is his remarkable attitude toward life. He never has let anything stand in his way.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are on this journey for a reason, I know that\u2014whether it was to bring attention to this illness [or] whether it was to save his mortal soul.\u201d\n\nAdditional information and resources for caregivers are available on AARP\u2019s online Caregiving Resource Center (www.aarp.org/caregiving).
