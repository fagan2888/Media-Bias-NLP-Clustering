The requirement that health insurers spend at least 80 percent of premiums on medical claims or quality improvements was added to the Affordable Care Act as a substitute for the so-called public option for a government-run health insurance plan. The so-called medical loss ratio (MLR) has been hailed by ACA supporters for providing consumers with nearly $2 billion in rebates from health insurers who didn't meet the spending ratio, and they argue it has also led to lower premiums as insurers cut administrative costs to meet it.

At a hearing he held May 21 on the MLR, Senate Commerce Committee Chairman Jay Rockefeller (D-W. Va.) took the opportunity to call for imposing a similar requirement on Medicaid managed care plans. Rockefeller helped get the MLR included in the ACA, and he introduced legislation in December 2013 (S. 1787) that would require plans that contract with state Medicaid agencies to meet an MLR standard.

Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.), ranking member of the committee, argued that MLR rebates are far outweighed by other costs from the law,

such as an estimated $1 trillion in health insurance taxes over the next 10 years.
