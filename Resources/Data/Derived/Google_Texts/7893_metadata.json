The union is appealing this ruling, but Icahn says that if they should win that appeal, he would likely close the casino.\n\nIcahn Says Tactics Remind Him of \u201cBygone Era\u201d\n\nIn the letter, Icahn went on to compare the tactics of union leaders to those of unscrupulous characters of the past.\n\n\u201cIt all reminds me of that bygone era when organized crime would demand grocers pay for protection, or suffer bricks being thrown through their store windows,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe only real difference here is that instead of throwing bricks through the Taj Mahal\u2019s windows, your union instead organizes strikes, picketing, boycotts and other attacks to deter customers from patronizing the Taj Mahal.\u201d\n\nThat picketing has continued in recent weeks. Last Friday, union members demonstrated again, the fifth time they have done so since the bankruptcy judge\u2019s decision last October.\n\n\u201cCarl Icahn has decided to run the Taj Mahal into the ground while he\u2019s waiting to take it over,\u201d said union president Bob McDevitt. \u201cToday we are saying we\u2019re not going to take this anymore.\u201d\n\nIcahn Approved to Take Over Taj Mahal\n\nLast Thursday, a bankruptcy judge approved a plan that will see Icahn take over Trump Entertainment Resorts, the parent company of the Taj Mahal. Icahn will swap $286 million worth of debt he owns in the company in exchange for that ownership once the company emerges from bankruptcy.\n\n\u201cThe Taj will remain open,\u201d said US Bankruptcy Judge Kevin Gross at a hearing last week. \u201cAnd it will be a successful venture.\u201d\n\nThat approval came just days after the casino reached an agreement with Donald Trump that will allow the Taj Mahal to keep the Trump name attached to it for the foreseeable future. Trump and his daughter, Ivanka Trump, had been fighting to have their family name removed from the venue.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Carl Icahn intensified his war of words with the union that represents workers at the Trump Taj Mahal, saying their tactics were reminiscent of organized criminal groups.", "og": {"site_name": "Casino.org", "description": "Carl Icahn intensified his war of words with the union that represents workers at the Trump Taj Mahal, saying their tactics were reminiscent of organized criminal groups.", "title": "Carl Icahn Compares Taj Mahal Union Leaders to Mobsters", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 1536, "identifier": "https://www.casino.org/news/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/o-CARL-ICAHN-facebook.jpg", "height": 1024}, "updated_time": "2015-03-21T19:59:49-07:00", "url": "https://www.casino.org/news/carl-icahn-compares-taj-mahal-union-leaders-to-mobsters", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Carl Icahn intensified his war of words with the union that represents workers at the Trump Taj Mahal, saying their tactics were reminiscent of organized criminal groups.", "creator": "@Casino_Org", "image": "https://www.casino.org/news/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/o-CARL-ICAHN-facebook.jpg", "title": "Carl Icahn Compares Taj Mahal Union Leaders to Mobsters", "site": "@Casino_Org", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "DC.date.issued": "2015-03-21T19:24:24-07:00", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.casino.org/news/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/corg_favicon.png", "article": {"publisher": "http://facebook.com/Casino.org", "section": "Financial", "published_time": "2015-03-21T19:24:24-07:00", "modified_time": "2015-03-21T19:59:49-07:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "\u201cCarl Icahn has decided to run the Taj Mahal into the ground while he\u2019s waiting to take it over,\u201d said union president Bob McDevitt.\n\u201cOver the last five years, while the Taj Mahal has gone bankrupt not just once, but twice, your Unite-HERE health plan has made $140 million in net income,\u201d Icahn wrote in the letter.\nIcahn and the union have had plenty of harsh words for each other over the past few months, but Icahn may have just ratcheted up the rhetoric even further.\nIcahn Says Tactics Remind Him of \u201cBygone Era\u201dIn the letter, Icahn went on to compare the tactics of union leaders to those of unscrupulous characters of the past.\nThe union is appealing this ruling, but Icahn says that if they should win that appeal, he would likely close the casino."}
