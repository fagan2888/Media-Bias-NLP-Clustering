Rick Scott.\n\nSpeaking with reporters late Wednesday, Gardiner said he was weighing whether to bypass the committee and bring Armstrong's nomination directly to the full chamber -- something that would break with statements the president has made before.\n\n\"I've stood here before you guys and said that I would not pull somebody out of Ethics and Elections,\" said Gardiner, R-Orlando. \"And I've got some real soul-searching to do to decide, should the entire Senate have a say on Dr. Armstrong?\"\n\nThe Senate president also noted that Armstrong had cleared the committee that deals with health-care policy before running into a roadblock in Ethics and Elections.\n\nBut Gardiner also said he wasn't sure whether there was enough support for the embattled surgeon general among all 40 senators.\n\n\"I have not done a vote count,\" Gardiner said. \"I don't know where the chamber would be if I brought him to the floor.\"\n\nAny action would likely come next week. If not confirmed by the Senate, Armstrong would be forced out of the position he's held since 2012.", "article_metadata": {"category": "HNF Stories", "description": "Senate President Andy Gardiner said late Wednesday he was considering bringing Surgeon General John Armstrong's nomination to the Senate floor, a", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://health.wusf.usf.edu/post/gardiner-considers-taking-armstrong-confirmation", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/healthnewsfl/files/styles/medium/public/201602/armstrong_cropped.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Senate President Andy Gardiner said late Wednesday he was considering bringing Surgeon General John Armstrong's nomination to the Senate floor, a", "title": "Gardiner Considers Taking Up Armstrong Confirmation"}, "org_id": 0, "twitter": {"site": "@HealthNewsFL", "card": "summary"}, "author": "News Service of Florida", "wordCount": 257, "dc": {"title": "Gardiner Considers Taking Up Armstrong Confirmation"}, "nid": 13834, "datePublished": "2016-03-03", "story_id": 469020150, "keywords": "Surgeon General John Armstrong, Florida Senate President Andy Gardiner, Florida Legislature, Florida Department of Health, Florida Legislature 2016", "has_audio": 0, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "If not confirmed by the Senate, Armstrong would be forced out of the position he's held since 2012.\nBut Gardiner also said he wasn't sure whether there was enough support for the embattled surgeon general among all 40 senators.\nThe confirmation of Armstrong, who is secretary of the Florida Department of Health, has been bottled up in the Senate Ethics and Elections Committee despite a lobbying effort by Gov.\nThe Senate president also noted that Armstrong had cleared the committee that deals with health-care policy before running into a roadblock in Ethics and Elections.\n\"I've stood here before you guys and said that I would not pull somebody out of Ethics and Elections,\" said Gardiner, R-Orlando."}
