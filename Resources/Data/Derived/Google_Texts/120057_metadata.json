Noting that California public education is \u201cchronically underfunded,\u201d the report gave the state\u2019s K-12 investment a D grade.\n\nGrowing up in an impoverished family, which research has closely linked to poor academic performance and poor health, presents a litany of barriers to achievement, the report said. For starters, poor families can\u2019t afford to send their children to quality preschools. And students who attend K-12 schools in poor neighborhoods are less likely, in general, to be taught by \u201ceffective\u201d teachers, the report said.\n\nNearly half of California\u2019s children are growing up in a poor or low-income household, where a family of four earns less than $45,622 a year, the report said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to remember that California has more children than any other state \u2013 and nearly half of them are low-income,\u201d said Jessica Mindnich, director of research at Children Now. \u201cIn order for all of our children to have an equal opportunity to succeed and to contribute financially to the state as they become adults, they need opportunities to have good health and enriching educational experiences.\u201d\n\nResearch has shown, the report said, that state investments in quality programs for children would more than pay for themselves in increased earnings and revenues and decreased costs for health care and prisons. \u201cThe earlier we make the investments, the higher the return,\u201d Mindnich said. \u201cAnd the earlier we provide children with the services they need, the less intensive the services they require.\u201d\n\nThe largely sobering report card comes as the state could find itself on July 1 with a potential multibillion-dollar surplus and potentially billions more to spend on K-12 and community college education, noted the new chairman of the state Assembly Budget Subcommittee on Education Finance, Assemblyman Al Muratsuchi, D-Torrance. The nonpartisan Legislative Analyst\u2019s Office has projected increases in state revenues, which in turn would raise education funding under Proposition 98, which requires that a minimum percentage of the state budget be spent on K-12 schools and community colleges.\n\nReacting to the Children Now report card, Muratsuchi said, \u201cWe obviously have a lot of work to do, but I think the Legislature is facing a historic opportunity to make some smart choices on how to best educate our kids.\u201d\n\nHe noted that the California State Assembly Democratic Caucus has listed expanding access to transitional kindergarten to all 4-year-olds among its top priorities for fiscal year 2014-15. That priority is in sync with the report card, which praised the fall 2012 rollout of the state\u2019s transitional kindergarten program. Transitional kindergarten provides an additional year of schooling for 4-year-olds who will turn 5 after September 1, which is the new kindergarten birthday cutoff date, and before or on December 1, the former cutoff date.\n\n\u201cI have a 4-year-old daughter, so I am very interested in early childhood education,\u201d Muratsuchi said. \u201cAnd as a former prosecutor, I know that if we don\u2019t make smart investments, I know where our kids can end up \u2013 in state prisons and in county jails.\u201d\n\nThe Children Now report card relies on a three-part rubric of key data points, comparisons over time and comparisons nationally \u2013 an admittedly subjective evaluation process, said Mindnich. In addition, this year\u2019s report card often defines children\u2019s issues differently than previous report cards, making it difficult to compare results across the years. For instance, this year\u2019s category of school-based health services was defined as \u201cintegrated services\u201d in 2011-12 and included Head Start\u2019s range of services.\n\nSome advocates chafed a bit at the low grades, the selection of data and what they considered to be a lack of depth in the analysis. \u201cThe section on teacher training is very thin,\u201d said Rob Riordan, president of the San Diego-based High Tech High Graduate School of Education. \u201cThey talk about the importance of quality training, but they don\u2019t say what it is.\u201d\n\nThe state\u2019s actions concerning discipline and \u201cschool climate,\u201d a broad term representing how supported students, teachers and parents feel at school, received a C-, which Greg Austin, director of the Health and Human Development Program at San Francisco-based WestEd, a nonprofit public research agency, felt was \u201ca little harsh.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it credits the state for having one of the premier data collection systems,\u201d said Austin, referring to the California Healthy Kids Survey from the California Department of Education, which is administered by WestEd. Launched in 1998, the statewide survey measures school climate, including academic supports, discipline and order, social and emotional learning and student traits such as empathy and persistence.\n\nSchool-based health services received a D+, a grade that Serena Clayton, executive director of the Oakland-based California School-Based Health Alliance (formerly the California School Health Centers Association), called an accurate reflection of the lack of state funding for health centers.\n\nBut the poor grade doesn\u2019t reflect what California schools have been able to create despite funding shortages, Clayton said: 226 school-based health centers are in place and available to 228,000 students, fueled in part by $30 million from the federal Affordable Care Act. Demand for health centers is strong, she said. \u201cPeople are recognizing that kids are coming to school with a whole host of issues that you cannot address, even with the best teachers and the best curriculum,\u201d Clayton said.\n\nAnd what of the B- for the new school funding law heralded by Gov. Jerry Brown as \u201crevolutionary\u201d? \u201cThat law did put California out in front in terms of a focus on equity and funding,\u201d acknowledged Ted Lempert, president of Children Now, who strongly advocated for the new law, known as the Local Control Funding Formula. But, he said, the state is still formulating regulations and districts haven\u2019t yet had a chance to realize the potential benefits\n\n\u201cA great law was passed but the real test is implementation,\u201d Lempert said.\n\nAs for the scope and purpose of the report card, he said, \u201cThis is intended to be a snapshot and a wake-up call.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cThis report card is aimed for policy makers and leaders and says, \u2018Come on. You made some good progress.\u2019 We think most of state leaders get it, but they\u2019re not making the tough decisions to actually move the needle forward.\u201d\n\nJane Meredith Adams covers student health.
