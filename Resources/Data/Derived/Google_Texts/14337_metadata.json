Burwell -- generally agree that if the high court decides that millions of recipients are no longer eligible, they likely will no longer be able to afford insurance under ObamaCare and exit the system.\n\nHowever, whether their departure would topple the entire health care law remains a matter of debate ahead of the expected high court ruling by June.\n\nMore On This... SCOTUS weighs challenge to ObamaCare tax credit subsidies\n\nLast week, Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell said nullifying the subsidies would cause \"massive damage to our health care system\" and that the administration would have no way to fix it.\n\nThe administration and Democrats who enacted the 2010 law over unanimous GOP opposition also largely back studies showing the number of people who would loses the subsidies, in the form of tax credits, is as high as 7.5 million.\n\nAnd a recent analysis by the health care firm Avalere found that those who would lose their subsidies as a result of the court ruling would have their premiums increase an average 225 percent.\n\nEd Haislmaier, a health care policy expert with the conservative-leaning Heritage Foundation, on Tuesday predicated some fallout, or \u201cdislocation\u2019 but not to such an extent.\n\n\u201cIs the sky going to fall?\u201d he asked. \u201cNo, but it\u2019s probably going to rain in some places.\u201d\n\nSeveral top Capitol Hill Republicans have in the past few days announced pending, short-term alternatives if the court invalidates the subsidies for residents of the 34 states that use the federal ObamaCare exchange, not their own.\n\nUtah Sen. Orrin Hatch, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, said last week that his plan will set the stage for a \u201cmore permanent fix\u201d but did not provide specifics.\n\nOn Sunday, Hatch was joined by fellow GOP Sens. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee and John Barrasso of Wyoming in a Washington Post opinion piece saying they have a plan.\n\n\u201cWe would provide financial assistance to help Americans keep the coverage they picked,\u201d the senators wrote. \"It would be unfair to allow families to lose their coverage, particularly in the middle of the year.\"\n\nHowever, they also provided no specifics on how to pay for the lost subsidies -- estimated at $36.1 billion.\n\nMost of the 34 states in question are GOP-run and represented in Congress by Republicans.\n\nOn Tuesday, an opinion offering by Reps. John Kline, R-Minn., Paul Ryan, R-Wis., and Fred Upton, R-Mich., appeared in The Wall Street Journal also presenting alternatives - but in more detail.\n\n\u201cNo family should pay for this administration\u2019s overreach,\u201d the congressmen, chairmen, respectively, of the House committees on Education and Workforce, Ways and Means, and Energy and Commerce wrote.\n\n\u201cThat is why House Republicans have formed a working group to propose a way out for the affected states if the court rules against the administration.\u201d\n\nThe congressmen said their ObamaCare \u201coff-ramp\u201d will in part allow states to opt out of coverage requirements that are driving up costs, let Americans buy the policies they want and make insurers compete for customers, rather than force Americans to buy a government-approved health plan \u201cunder the threat of IRS fines.\u201d\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this story.", "article_metadata": {"classification":
