But an equally big issue, looming larger this time, is the orchestra\u2019s size.\n\nSeeking a sustainable operating model, management wants to control the number of musicians (or, to employ the industry phrase, \u201cthe complement\u201d) going forward. The players protest that making the orchestra any smaller will destroy its sound, and say they don\u2019t trust ASO leadership with power over such a sensitive matter.\n\nAmong the several major areas of disagreement between the two sides, who made little progress in forging a deal in eight months of bargaining prior to the lockout, this could be a key one in potentially delaying the opening of the 70th anniversary season on Sept. 25.\n\nThe dispute has drawn national attention because of the ongoing travails of the orchestral industry and because the Woodruff Arts Center is the Southeast\u2019s largest art entity, a nonprofit with its administration and four divisions operating on a combined $90 million budget that attracts 1.2 million to its Midtown campus yearly. The Woodruff dominates arts funding in a city with only three independent arts organizations with budgets topping $2 million: Atlanta Ballet, Atlanta Opera and the Center for Puppetry Arts.\n\nStill, the Woodruff has had trouble balancing the ASO\u2019s world-class ambitions and its poor financial performance, causing the arts center\u2019s overall credit rating to be downgraded last year.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re all tired of hearing that management wants to maintain this orchestra as a world-class orchestra,\u201d said Daniel Laufer, an ASO cellist and ASO Players Association negotiating committee member. \u201cYou can\u2019t (cut) this orchestra any further. Either you try to maintain it and grow it back in the direction from where we came, or it\u2019s over \u2014 it\u2019s not the same orchestra any more.\u201d\n\nAt issue is a management proposal in which ASO president and CEO Stanley Romanstein would negotiate with music director Robert Spano and Players Association representatives on whether and how positions would be filled as they come open. In cases where a consensus could not be reached, Romanstein would have the final say.\n\nHis unique proposal is not modeled on an arrangement at another major American orchestra, where typically the complement is set \u2014 and the number fiercely protected by the musicians \u2014 in the collective bargaining agreement.\n\nRomanstein admits that it and other aspects of the ASO\u2019s final offer before the prior contract expired are \u201cdifferent approaches than other orchestras have taken\u201d but characterizes them as \u201ccourageous.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe (musicians\u2019) fear is \u2018Oh, they\u2019re trying to negotiate the orchestra down to some small number,\u2019\u201d Romanstein said. \u201cNot true in any sense. We\u2019re simply asking for a strategic and thoughtful conversation about how we manage the size of the complement. It\u2019s the same thing we do with any staff opening.\u201d\n\nExcept symphonic musicians hold their combined sound as sacrosanct.\n\nAtlanta Symphony Orchestra Players Association president Paul Murphy said he believed the musicians had \u201cmanaged to maintain\u201d its critically praised sound despite the reductions of the last two years.\n\n\u201cBut we\u2019re at that threshold now,\u201d the associate principal violist quickly added. \u201cIf they cut any further, it really will start to impact the artistic level.\u201d\n\nMurphy said fewer players demands a greater workload for every musician. \u201cFor instance in the viola section, we had 11, now we\u2019re down to eight,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that means fewer times where you\u2019re rotated off, there\u2019s more playing, you have to produce a bigger sound and make up for less players. It promotes a greater physical strain,\u201d risking stress injuries. The ASO\u2019s bass section also is \u201cwoefully short,\u201d down from eight to five, Murphy said.\n\nEven though conductors are typically neutral parties in orchestra labor disputes, ASO music director Robert Spano and principal guest conductor Donald Runnicles addressed the complement\u2019s size straight on in an open letter issued just before the contract deadline.\n\n\u201cThere are artistic lines that cannot and must not be crossed,\u201d they wrote. \u201cWe must re-dedicate ourselves to the ASO\u2019s founding principles of excellence and to the support of a full, robust, and world-class symphony orchestra.\u201d\n\nFreelance classical music critic James Paulk, who writes for The Atlanta Journal-Constitution and classical music publications, said he\u2019s \u201cwrestled in my own mind\u201d for two years over whether if the ASO\u2019s sound has suffered from the shrinkage.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re playing Mozart, it shouldn\u2019t matter at all, as you would normally not use anything close to 88 musicians, or 75 for that matter,\u201d Paulk said. \u201cBut for Wagner, Mahler and the other big Romantic and Modern works, it becomes a factor. The sound from a bigger orchestra is more elegant and richer, with a deeper tone.\u201d\n\nBy comparison to Atlanta\u2019s complement of 88, the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, whose musicians issued a letter of support for their ASO peers this week that included a sharp rebuke of the ASO\u2019s administration, has a contracted size of 106 full-time players. The Cleveland Orchestra, still known for the robust sound that the late George Szell built as he expanded its ranks as music director more than a half-century ago, has 104.\n\nThe Minnesota Orchestra, which underwent a 16-month lockout that caused an entire season to be lost and led to the departure of musicians and its music director, Osmo V\u00e4nsk\u00e4, is playing with 77 full-time musicians this season because it could not audition for and fill open positions quickly enough. Its agreement signed in January calls for it to rise to a full complement of 95 musicians over the three-year deal.\n\nEven if a contract is forged in time for the season here to start on time, the ASO\u2019s full-time ranks will be at a reduced number. Because of defections, retirements and deaths, the orchestra now has 78 musicians under contract. An ASO spokesman said substitute musicians will be used to fill in when required by individual pieces of music.\n\nMeanwhile, ASO management has postponed all auditions until the dispute is resolved.\n\nRomanstein denies that he has a set number in mind for the ASO\u2019s complement, saying that it would simply \u201cgive us great flexibility in how we hire and under what circumstances we hire. If it\u2019s a position we need to fill right away \u2026 OK. But what we have now is a fixed number in the contract and when there is an opening, we are legally obligated to make a full-time hire for that position right away, (with) lots of rules and regulations governing how we do that.\n\n\u201cWe want to be responsible financially; we also want to support the art,\u201d he continued. \u201cAnd we think that flexibility could position us in a very different way to keep those things in balance.\u201d\n\nASO Players Association negotiators believe Romanstein has targeted a number far less than 88 and say they aren\u2019t buying the idea of him controlling the orchestra\u2019s size.\n\nIn fact, the musicians\u2019 final proposal before negotiations broke off was to increase the complement over the next four years to 89.\n\nNO CONTRACT TALKS The opening of the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra\u2019s 70th season scheduled Sept. 25 appears to be at growing risk, with the two sides at an impasse and with no plans to return to the negotiating table since management locked the musicians out last Sunday. 9/7 \u201cAs we have said before, we have offered to meet and have offered to bring a federal mediator into the negotiations,\u201d ASO spokesman Randy Donaldson said, \u201cbut the union has not agreed to.\u201d The ASO Players Association said there is little to discuss after ASO president and CEO Stanley Romanstein sent them a letter on Sunday declining the musicians\u2019 last offer as one that wouldn\u2019t help \u201cachieve sustainability,\u201d and saying the distance was too great for management to make a counter-proposal. Players Association president Paul Murphy said, \u201cThey are unwilling to negotiate and will not move from (what management termed its \u201cLast, Best and Final\u201d offer), and want the musicians to negotiate with ourselves.\u201d With no progress toward a collective bargaining agreement, ASO board chairwoman Karole Lloyd cancelled next week\u2019s regularly scheduled board meeting \u2014 \u201cbecause we do not anticipate any updates,\u201d she wrote in an email sent on Thursday. HOWARD POUSNER\n\nTHE STORY SO FAR\n\nThe Atlanta Symphony Orchestra has racked up deficits for 12 consecutive years, but the push toward a sustainable model took new urgency when the accumulated debt rose to $23 million by the end of fiscal 2012, including $18 million borrowed against earnings on the orchestra\u2019s endowment.\n\nSeeking significant concessions to halt the red ink, management locked out the musicians during tense 2012 collective bargaining agreement negotiations. After a month without pay, the players agreed with great rancor to a $5.2 million wage reduction over two years (an average of $14,000 annually for each) and other cuts.\n\nIn 2013, Moody\u2019s Investors Service downgraded the Woodruff\u2019s credit outlook from stable to negative, largely because of the ASO debt.\n\nThe orchestra finished the 2014 fiscal year with a $2 million operating deficit on a budget of $37 million.\n\nEight months of negotiations for a new collective bargaining agreement this year proved unsuccessful. Management said its final proposal was for a four-year deal with an escalating salary increase topping out at 4.5 percent in the final year. The musicians propose a roughly 15 percent salary increase over four years \u2014 basically the amount the players gave up 2012. Another point of division was health care, with the musicians being asked to shoulder a greater share of the cost which they said would turn management\u2019s raise offer into a net decrease.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "Atlanta Life and Culture Blog", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"url": "http://artsculture.blog.ajc.com/2014/09/13/orchestras-size-resonates-as-big-issue-in-atlanta-symphony-dispute/", "image": "http://cmgajcartsculture.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/orchestra-overhead.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "With Atlanta Symphony Orchestra management determined to halt a decade of deficit operations in 2012, its locked-out musicians grudgingly agreed to a contract in which their pay was cut by an...", "title": "Orchestra\u2019s size resonates as big issue in Atlanta Symphony dispute | Atlanta Life and Culture Blog"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "Previews, reviews and commentary on Atlanta's cultural scene", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://artsculture.blog.ajc.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/e77f0dd93bf90e0b6a31a158abb039b8?s=16", "keywords": "access atlanta, arts and culture, concerts, events, arts, atlanta, atlanta symphony orchestra", "viewport": "width=1024", "description": "With Atlanta Symphony Orchestra management determined to halt a decade of deficit operations in 2012, its locked-out musicians grudgingly agreed to a contract in which their pay was cut by an average of 14 percent and their full-time ranks were trimmed from 95 to 88."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf0ee\"", "article_summary": "Meanwhile, ASO management has postponed all auditions until the dispute is resolved.\nBut an equally big issue, looming larger this time, is the orchestra\u2019s size.\nAtlanta Symphony Orchestra Players Association president Paul Murphy said he believed the musicians had \u201cmanaged to maintain\u201d its critically praised sound despite the reductions of the last two years.\n\u201cWe\u2019re all tired of hearing that management wants to maintain this orchestra as a world-class orchestra,\u201d said Daniel Laufer, an ASO cellist and ASO Players Association negotiating committee member.\nSeeking a sustainable operating model, management wants to control the number of musicians (or, to employ the industry phrase, \u201cthe complement\u201d) going forward."}
