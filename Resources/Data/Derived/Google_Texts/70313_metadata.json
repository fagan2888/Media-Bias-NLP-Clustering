ADF's mission made a great stride as their formation team was highlighted at Nathan Phillips Square in the heart of Toronto, and at the Rogers Center for the internationally televised Pan Am Games Closing Ceremonies. The opportunity for dancers in wheelchairs to perform center stage among their peers was the ultimate demonstration of equality and inclusion.\n\n\"Our performance at the Closing Ceremonies marked the 25th anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act. This opportunity was a chance to show what incredible things can be done when all communities unite,\" said ADF dancer Ania Flatau.\n\nThe opportunity to dance at the Pan Am Games came about when Marchione was hired as one of the choreographers of the event.\n\n\"Most of the dancers in my group did not know one another, but by the end of the performance, we felt like a family. What we experienced together was really wonderful, and I am lucky to have had such an enthusiastic team,\" she said.\n\nThe South Amboy YMCA and Arthur Murray Manhattan on Fifth Avenue provided rehearsal space for the troupe a week prior to traveling to Toronto. On July 20, ADF was welcomed by the U.S. Consulate in Toronto during a reception at the renowned Cambria Gallery.\n\n\"We are so grateful for the support we received from the U.S. Consulate, the Fordney Foundation, Cobbs Creek Healthcare and Ballroom Dress Rental. We are very fortunate to have people who believe in our mission and share our mindset,\" said ADF Executive Director Melinda Kremer.\n\nADF first took the stage at Nathan Phillips Square, and was named one of the top 3 performances during PANAMANIA, the 35-day arts festival that accompanies the Games.\n\nAmerican DanceWheels Foundation (ADF), a nonprofit organization that uses ballroom and Latin dance to overcome the social barriers between people with and without disabilities, performs at the Pan Am Games Closing Ceremonies.

Children are often very curious about disability but are prevented from asking questions. After our performances, several excited children came over to meet us. What was inspiring was that instead of learning to be scared of those with disabilities, they saw how we are similar and what we are capable of,\" said ADF dancer Derrick Williamson.\n\nDuring the Closing Ceremonies on July 26, the dancers performed a tantalizing Tango alongside Pitbull, Kanye West and Serena Ryder for an audience of more than 45,000. Their dance was very well received, and American DanceWheels, along with Marchione, look forward to sharing more performances with audiences everywhere.\n\nFollow American DanceWheels at www.facebook.com/americandancewheels, or visit www.americandancewheels.org.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://mycj.co/1T6oGFd", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "South Amboy resident and American DanceWheels Foundation's Artistic Director, Aubree Marchione, has been working with the organization to change the public's perception about people with disabilities through dance", "og": {"site_name": "MY CENTRAL JERSEY", "description": "South Amboy resident and American DanceWheels Foundation's Artistic Director, Aubree Marchione, has been working with the organization to change the public's perception about people with disabilities through dance", "title": "Dancers in wheelchairs takes center stage", "url": "http://www.mycentraljersey.com/story/news/local/middlesex-county/2015/08/08/dancers-wheelchairs-tango/31295435/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/mycentraljersey.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "South Amboy resident and American DanceWheels Foundation's Artistic Director, Aubree Marchione, has been working with the organization to change the public's perception about people with disabilities through dance", "title": "Dancers in wheelchairs takes center stage", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/c141cda97dcddea019bea354ac49b4414c1275fe/c=703-0-3515-2812&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/08/07/Bridgewater/B9318344827Z.1_20150807143424_000_G94BHTD4C.1-0.jpg", "creator": "@MyCentralJersey", "site": "@MyCentralJersey", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=859380356", "fb": {"app_id": 177893718898560}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": "dance, Pan Am Games, disabilities, South Amboy"}, "article_summary": "The opportunity for dancers in wheelchairs to perform center stage among their peers was the ultimate demonstration of equality and inclusion.\nTheir dance was very well received, and American DanceWheels, along with Marchione, look forward to sharing more performances with audiences everywhere.\nFollow American DanceWheels at www.facebook.com/americandancewheels, or visit www.americandancewheels.org.\n\"Most of the dancers in my group did not know one another, but by the end of the performance, we felt like a family.\nThe opportunity to dance at the Pan Am Games came about when Marchione was hired as one of the choreographers of the event."}
