John Barrasso (R-Wyo.) as Senate Republican Policy Committee chairman, the fourth-highest Senate GOP leadership position. The only problem \u2014 Barrasso is planning to run for re-election, and he has the backing of many in the conference. So Lee\u2019s challenge could be short-lived.\n\nThe leadership election is also far away, generally held a few weeks after the November election.\n\n\u201cSenator Barrasso has done a great job,\u201d Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Texas), the No. 2 Senate GOP leader, said Tuesday. \u201cHe\u2019s running for re-election, and I\u2019ll support him.\u201d\n\nLee\u2019s spokeswoman Emily Long told Morning Consult that the conservative hard-liner is running for the leadership post because he believes Barrasso is ineligible for another term. He is not specifically trying to challenge him.\n\n\u201cI saw a seat opening up and I\u2019m interested in policy and naturally, I\u2019m interested in anything to promote an active, lively discussion among members of the Senate Republican conference,\u201d Lee told the Examiner.\n\nSen. Jeff Flake, who spoke with Lee, said Long\u2019s description matched his own understanding of Lee\u2019s decision to run.\n\n\u201cMy understanding was he wasn\u2019t mounting a challenge, but he was only running if Barrasso was not,\u201d the Arizona Republican told reporters on Capitol Hill. \u201cThat was my understanding, but I don\u2019t want to mischaracterize anything. I think Senator Barrasso has done a great job, and I would support him continuing there.\u201d\n\nOn Tuesday, both Lee and Barrasso brushed off reporters when asked about the upcoming leadership election. But Long confirmed to Morning Consult that Lee contends that the position is open and that Barrasso is term-limited.\n\nCurrently, senators on the GOP leadership team are limited to three terms. Barrasso served one partial term and is in the middle of his second full term. Lee believes the partial term counts, while most of his Republican colleagues disagree. According to Lee\u2019s logic, Senate Republican Conference Chairman John Thune (R-S.D.), and Conference Vice Chairman Roy Blunt (R-Mo.) would also be ineligible to run for another term.\n\n\u201cIf the term limit kicked in at that point you\u2019d have the absurd position at the end of the term limit that you would be in the middle of a Congress, changing, having elections and changing leadership, and changing staff, and all the rest,\u201d Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said Tuesday on Capitol Hill. \u201cWe\u2019ve had this issue a couple times in the past, and so I think I can safely say it\u2019s been the position of the conference that a partial term does not count toward a three-term limit.\u201d\n\nMcConnell\u2019s spokesman Don Stewart added in an email, \u201cSens. Thune, Barrasso, and Blunt are all eligible to run again. The leader believes they\u2019ve all done a great job and he hopes that they do all run again.\u201d\n\nBarrasso was elected as the Senate Republican Policy Committee Chairman after Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.) stepped down from Senate GOP leadership in January 2012.\n\n\u201cHis decision may be premature,\u201d Alexander said Tuesday of Lee\u2019s decision to run. \u201cI think there\u2019s a precedent in place that makes it pretty clear that if you leave in the middle of a term, that\u2019s not counted toward your three terms.\u201d\n\nElected in the tea party wave of 2010, Lee drew the ire of many Senate Republicans early on for his hardline stances and for backing the 2013 government shutdown over funding for the Affordable Care Act. But in recent years, Lee has also garnered a reputation for bipartisanship, working with Republicans and Democrats on reforms to surveillance laws and criminal justice.\n\nWill Dobbs-Allsopp and Mary Ellen McIntire contributed.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/icons/browserconfig.xml", "description": "After mending fences with his Senate Republican colleagues, Mike Lee is once again ruffling the feathers of the GOP establishment.", "og": {"site_name": "Morning Consult", "description": "After mending fences with his Senate Republican colleagues, Mike Lee is once again ruffling the feathers of the GOP establishment.", "title": "Mike Lee the Maverick Reverts to Type", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 1620, "identifier": "https://morningconsult.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Morning-committees-22.jpg", "height": 1080}, "updated_time": "2016-04-12T18:21:22-04:00", "url": "https://morningconsult.com/2016/04/12/mike-lee-the-maverick-reverts-to-type/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "After mending fences with his Senate Republican colleagues, Mike Lee is once again ruffling the feathers of the GOP establishment.", "title": "Mike Lee the Maverick Reverts to Type", "image": "https://morningconsult.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Morning-committees-22.jpg", "creator": "@JonTReid", "site": "@morningconsult", "card": "summary"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#2b5797", "robots": "noodp", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "msapplication-TileImage": "/icons/mstile-144x144.png", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Morning-Consult-183517831660100/", "section": "Congress", "published_time": "2016-04-12T16:40:12-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-12T18:21:22-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "as Senate Republican Policy Committee chairman, the fourth-highest Senate GOP leadership position.\nAccording to Lee\u2019s logic, Senate Republican Conference Chairman John Thune (R-S.D.\nAfter mending fences with his Senate Republican colleagues, Mike Lee is once again ruffling the feathers of the GOP establishment in a dispute over leadership election rules.\n\u201cI saw a seat opening up and I\u2019m interested in policy and naturally, I\u2019m interested in anything to promote an active, lively discussion among members of the Senate Republican conference,\u201d Lee told the Examiner.\nThe Utah Republican told The Washington Examiner this week that he is running to succeed Sen.
