(AP) - Documents show a Wentzville processing facility for Affordable Care Act applications logged more than 13,000 hours of overtime to make up for a backlog after the initial sign-up period.\n\nThe St. Louis Post-Dispatch (http://bit.ly/1Jm4dCO ) obtained documents showing that workers at the facility run by Serco Inc. logged the hours from May 1 through Aug. 15 of last year.\n\nSerco runs the facility for the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. The company was awarded a five-year contract worth up to $1.2 billion.\n\nAgency spokesman Aaron Albright says the cost of that overtime was covered under the contractor\u2019s original contract, and did not cost taxpayers any extra money. He said last year the same computer issues that hampered applicants trying to sign up for health care also delayed their processing work.\n\nThe Wentzville facility was created to process paper applications and to help resolve any differences in documents for people who sought coverage under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nIn an August report, Serco said that it was not until May, eight months after the initial application process began, that the system was functional enough to process inconsistencies.\n\nThe paper obtained documents indicating the overtime hours after whistleblower allegations said employees at Wentzville were purposely working slowly because they had little to do.\n\n\u201cSerco, at its Wentzville facility, has been accused of allowing staff who are bored to sleep on the job, read books, play games, etc.,\u201d two Serco officials said in a February report to CMS. \u201cIn addition, we have been accused of not providing adequate training and support to our \u2026 staff. Both accusations are baseless and untrue.\u201d\n\nCMS would not allow Serco officials to comment about the allegations, but Albright says that company is not denying the allegations.\n\n\u201cSerco has high standards when it comes to rules of behavior and practice in the workplace,\u201d Albright said. \u201cIf employees do not meet these performance standards or violate any of these workplace rules, they are appropriately disciplined or terminated. CMS has put in place additional measures to monitor Serco\u2019s performance and worker productivity over the last year.\u201d\n\n___\n\nInformation from: St. Louis Post-Dispatch, http://www.stltoday.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "Documents show a Wentzville processing facility for Affordable Care Act applications logged more than 13,000 hours of overtime to make up for a backlog after the initial sign-up period.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/apr/20/affordable-care-act-contractor-logs-13000-hours-in/", "site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "type": "article", "description": "Documents show a Wentzville processing facility for Affordable Care Act applications logged more than 13,000 hours of overtime to make up for a backlog after the initial sign-up period.", "title": "Affordable Care Act contractor logs 13,000 hours in overtime"}, "twitter": {"description": "Documents show a Wentzville processing facility for Affordable Care Act applications logged more than 13,000 hours of overtime to make up for a backlog after the initial sign-up period.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Affordable Care Act contractor logs 13,000 hours in overtime"}, "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1e0b\"", "article_summary": "(AP) - Documents show a Wentzville processing facility for Affordable Care Act applications logged more than 13,000 hours of overtime to make up for a backlog after the initial sign-up period.\nThe paper obtained documents indicating the overtime hours after whistleblower allegations said employees at Wentzville were purposely working slowly because they had little to do.\nThe Wentzville facility was created to process paper applications and to help resolve any differences in documents for people who sought coverage under the Affordable Care Act.\n\u201cSerco has high standards when it comes to rules of behavior and practice in the workplace,\u201d Albright said.\nThe St. Louis Post-Dispatch (http://bit.ly/1Jm4dCO ) obtained documents showing that workers at the facility run by Serco Inc. logged the hours from May 1 through Aug. 15 of last year."}
