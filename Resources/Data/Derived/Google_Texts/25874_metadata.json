In addition to penning three syndicated columns a week, that is.\n\nIt took him three years, but Witcover has every right to be pleased with the result.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMost of us probably wouldn\u2019t sit down to read an individual biography of each of this nation\u2019s 47 second-in-commands. Thus the appeal of this volume. \u201cThe American Vice Presidency: From Irrelevance to Power\u201d (Smithsonian Books) devotes five to 15 pages to each, which felt just right to this easily distracted occasional armchair historian.\n\nFourteen of those men became presidents, eight following the death of a sitting president. Four of those presidential deaths came through assassination. Interestingly, it was Witcover\u2019s own nearness to two assassination attempts, one fatal, that helped stir his interest in doing a book that explored the way vice presidents have been chosen. He was just a few feet away in the kitchen of the Ambassador Hotel on June 5, 1968, when Sirhan Sirhan fatally shot Democratic presidential hopeful Robert F. Kennedy. He was there in Sacramento on Sept. 5, 1975, when Lynette \u201cSqueaky\u201d Fromme, a Charles Manson follower, pulled a gun in an attempt to shoot President Ford.\n\nGiven the very real chance that a vice president will become president, a poor selection does the nation a real disservice. And yet, over the years, \u201cmost vice presidents were picked without much care, either as a booby prize or for the part of the country or the state they came from,\u201d he says.\n\nTwo recent VP picks have left him nonplussed.\n\n\u201cI was particularly amazed when the senior George Bush picked Dan Quayle, because George H.W. was only vice president for about 10 weeks when Ronald Reagan was shot,\u201d Witcover says. \u201cI figured he of all people would make a serious choice.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe minces no words about John McCain\u2019s selection of Sarah Palin as his 2008 running mate: \u201cIt was an insult to the country and the office.\u201d\n\nAn example of a poor pick that had serious consequences for the country came when Abraham Lincoln dumped Hannibal Hamlin of Maine, his smart, principled, energetic VP, because he felt he needed a pro-union Southerner on the ticket to win reelection in 1864. He got that in Andrew Johnson, but when one of our greatest presidents fell to an assassin\u2019s bullet, his mediocre successor quickly became embroiled in a bitter battle with Congress over reconstruction.\n\nSome fascinating figures emerge from Witcover\u2019s history, figures like Charles Curtis, who had Kaw Indian heritage and lived some of his childhood on an Indian Reservation, where he spoke French and Kaw before he did English. Curtis spent his teen years as a jockey; his horse-riding success won him recognition that later helped launch his political career \u2014 a career that ultimately led to his selection as Herbert Hoover\u2019s VP.\n\nOr Henry Wilson, whose father put his 10-year-old son into a form of farm servitude for most of his teen years, after which he moved from New Hampshire to Natick, became a cobbler, won a legislative seat, and then rode the brief Know Nothing wave to a US Senate seat. Wilson then became a Republican, a fervent opponent of slavery, and a populist. Chosen as Ulysses S. Grant\u2019s running mate in his 1872 reelection campaign, Wilson traveled some 10,000 miles as part of Grant\u2019s reelection effort, only to suffer a first stroke two months into his term and a second, fatal one, some two years later.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s Charles Dawes, the accomplished Kansan who served as Calvin Coolidge\u2019s VP \u2014 and whose favorite exclamation \u2014 \u201cHell and Maria\u201d \u2014 proved both a crowd-pleaser and a nickname-imparter. Shut out of the administration\u2019s inner councils by the reserved and perhaps resentful Coolidge, the outspoken Dawes refused to preside quietly over the US Senate, but instead lectured its members about the time they wasted filibustering.\n\nSo what\u2019s next for Jules, now 87? Well, he\u2019s looking for a subject \u2014 not for his three-time-a-week column, mind you, but for his next book.\n\n\u201cThis is my 19th book and I\u2019d like to make it an even 20,\u201d he said. \u201cBut this one took a lot out of me.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"eomportal-loid": "4.0.523652520", "eomportal-id": 113459, "description": "Here\u2019s one thing I\u2019m grateful for this holiday season: That my old campaign-trail friend Jules Witcover decided that writing a book about America\u2019s vice presidents would be a good project to undertake in his mid-80s.
