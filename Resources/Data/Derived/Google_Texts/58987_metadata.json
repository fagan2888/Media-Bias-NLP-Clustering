This flame-throwing right-hander can reach triple digits with his fastball, has struck out 1\u00bd batters per inning this spring and is a perfect 1 for 1 with an RBI at the plate.\n\nIt\u2019s appropriate, then, that Caminero is named after a couple of Greek mathematicians, Archimedes and Euclid. Caminero\u2019s father, a construction worker in Santa Domingo, Dominican Republic, picked the names out of an algebra textbook.\n\n\"I do like math,\u201d Caminero, 27, said Friday. \u201cI used to be really, really good. Now, I'm slowing down a little.\"\n\nThe competition in the Pirates bullpen, though, is just picking up.\n\nCaminero, acquired from the Miami Marlins in February for cash considerations, is fighting for a spot in the bullpen, as are right-handers Jared Hughes, John Holdzkom, Stolmy Pimentel, among others.\n\nCaminero is out of minor league options, so the Pirates will have to either keep him in the majors or run the risk of losing him in waivers.\n\nSo far, Caminero has made a good case for staying. He has struck out a team-high 12 in eight innings this spring, allowing two runs, six hits and one walk.\n\n\u201cI feel like I\u2019m competing against one thing, and it's my goal,\u201d he said. \u201cThat's my only competition. I just see them as teammates who are trying to help the team, just like me.\"\n\nThat goal?\n\n\u201cTo get better than last year.\u201d\n\nCaminero had a 4.86 ERA and 79 strikeouts in 63 innings in 2014 with Class AAA New Orleans. He was called up to the majors twice and allowed eight runs in 6\u2154 innings.\n\nCaminero\u2019s arsenal includes a cutter, splitter and short slider. That all comes secondary to the fastball. If the heater is right, Caminero said, everything else falls into place.\n\nCaminero arrived in Bradenton 10 days before camp eager to work with pitching coaches Ray Searage and Jim Benedict. They watched a few bullpen sessions and worked to refine Caminero\u2019s mechanics.\n\nThe trick to the sky-high strikeout rate, Caminero said, is \u201cI don't try to strike them out.\" He laughed. \"When you try to strike them out, you won't. I used to try.\u201d\n\nOr, as he put later, he\u2019s learning to pitch rather than to throw. The focus now is on mixing pitches and becoming an efficient pitcher. He wants every at-bat over in three pitches or fewer. If it results in a strikeout, so be it.\n\n\u201cI don't want to go deep into counts,\u201d he said. \u201cI just go after them.\u201d\n\n\u25cf NOTE \u2014 The Pirates optioned right-hander Nick Kingham and catcher Elias Diaz to Class AAA Indianapolis. Kingham struck out three and allowed three hits and no runs in six innings this spring. Diaz was 7 of 16 (.438) with a home run and four RBIs.\n\nStephen J.
