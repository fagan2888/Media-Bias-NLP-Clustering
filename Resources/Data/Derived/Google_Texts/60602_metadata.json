But they come as separate laboratory research released Friday strengthens the case that Zika causes a serious birth defect called microcephaly \u2014 babies born with abnormally small heads \u2014 by targeting embryonic brain cells.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s much more than microcephaly,\u201d said Dr. Karin Nielsen of the University of California, Los Angeles, who led the pregnancy study with colleagues at the Fiocruz Institute in Brazil. \u201cIt seems like it can act on multiple fronts.\u201d\n\nThe mosquito-borne virus, which is spreading in Latin America and the Caribbean, normally causes only mild symptoms, if any, in adults. But it raised alarm when Brazilian health officials reported an apparent surge in babies born with microcephaly, which can signal their brains didn\u2019t develop properly. Reports have documented traces of the virus in the brains of affected babies who died soon after birth, and in fetal brain tissue after abortion.\n\nThe study from Brazil, reported Friday in the New England Journal of Medicine, took a closer look during pregnancy.\n\nThe study so far is tracking 88 otherwise healthy pregnant women who sought care for Zika-like symptoms at a clinic run by the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation in Rio de Janiero between September and last month. Tests showed 72 were actively infected with the virus. Forty-two of the infected women, and all of the presumably non-infected ones, agreed to fetal ultrasound exams. Those ultrasounds found abnormalities in 12 of the infected women, or 29 percent. The non-infected women all had normal ultrasounds.\n\nThe exams did uncover some abnormal brain development. But they also detected two fetuses that died in utero during the last trimester; poor growth even without microcephaly; problems with the placenta; and one case that prompted an emergency C-section because of low amniotic fluid, Nielsen said.\n\nSix live births have occurred so far. One baby has severe microcephaly. Two were born too small for gestational age, one of whom had lesions in the eyes that signal vision problems if not blindness. Two other babies had normal ultrasounds and indeed, appear healthy. The baby delivered by emergency C-section struggled initially but now also appears healthy, Nielsen said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Evidence of Zika\u2019s risk to pregnant women continues to grow", "title": "Evidence of Zika\u2019s risk to pregnant women continues to grow", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Evidence of Zika\u2019s risk to pregnant women continues to grow", "title": "Evidence of Zika\u2019s risk to pregnant women continues to grow", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2016/03/05/evidence_of_zikas_risk_to_pregnant_women_continues_to_grow/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/03/zika-birth-defects.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Evidence of Zika\u2019s risk to pregnant women continues to grow", "title": "Evidence of Zika\u2019s risk to pregnant women continues to grow", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/03/zika-birth-defects.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Lauran Neergaard and Malcolm Ritter", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Forty-two of the infected women, and all of the presumably non-infected ones, agreed to fetal ultrasound exams.\nThose ultrasounds found abnormalities in 12 of the infected women, or 29 percent.\nThe baby delivered by emergency C-section struggled initially but now also appears healthy, Nielsen said.\nBut they come as separate laboratory research released Friday strengthens the case that Zika causes a serious birth defect called microcephaly \u2014 babies born with abnormally small heads \u2014 by targeting embryonic brain cells.\nThe findings released Friday are preliminary results from the first study tracking pregnant women in Brazil from the time they were infected, and do not prove that Zika is to blame."}
