Renee Ellmers hits a couple of bad notes.\n\nAiken falsely claims Ellmers \u201cvoted against the payroll tax cut because she thought $1,000 out of your pocket is not that much money.\u201d She voted against a two-month extension because it wasn\u2019t long enough, and helped craft a bipartisan bill that extended the payroll tax holiday for one year.\n\nAiken also says Ellmers failed to \u201cstop a Fort Bragg Air Wing from being moved out of state,\u201d because she missed a deadline for filing a bill amendment with the House Rules Committee. But that had nothing to do with the amendment not coming up for a floor vote. More important, the airlift wing hasn\u2019t moved, and Ellmers is still fighting to keep it from being relocated.\n\nAiken, a Democrat best known nationally for his runner-up finish on American Idol in 2003, is fighting an uphill battle to unseat the incumbent. Redistricting has given Republicans a decided advantage in North Carolina\u2019s 2nd District, and a flash poll in late September showed Ellmers ahead, but with Aiken making a race of it.\n\nPayroll Tax\n\nIn his latest ad, Aiken makes the argument that Washington has changed Ellmers.\n\n\u201cWe all hope people go to Congress with good intentions,\u201d Aiken says in direct-to-camera appeal. \u201cBut after Renee Ellmers got there, she voted against the payroll tax cut because she thought $1,000 out of your pocket is not that much money.\u201d That\u2019s a gross distortion of Ellmers\u2019 position.\n\nThe payroll tax holiday enacted in 2011 reduced the employee share of the Social Security payroll tax from 6.2 percent to 4.2 percent. The temporary recession relief was set to expire at the end of 2011, setting off a contentious round of partisan congressional haggling.\n\nThe Aiken ad cites a Dec. 21, 2011, report on Time Warner Cable News on the House rejecting a Senate plan to extend payroll tax cuts for two months, with Ellmers joining the Republican majority. But as the accompanying interview with Ellmers indicates, her position was exactly the opposite of what Aiken suggests. In the interview, she explains that instead of a two-month extension, she and other House Republicans preferred extending it for a full year.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re all about the year extension,\u201d Ellmers said in the TWCN report. \u201cThat\u2019s what we voted in the House of Representatives. \u2026 We\u2019re just not in agreement that a two-month or eight-week extension, as the Senate has passed back to us, is acceptable.\u201d\n\nIn the interview, Ellmers did refer to the payroll tax extension \u2014 which she estimated at $1,000 a year for the average American \u2014 as \u201cnot that much money for anyone.\u201d But contrary to the Aiken ad\u2019s suggestion that Ellmers wanted to nix the tax cut because it wasn\u2019t that much money, the context of the interview makes clear that Ellmers was saying it was \u201cnot that much money\u201d when compared with the comprehensive tax reform changes she and other Republicans envision.\n\nEllmers, Dec. 21, 2011: Well, the thing is, the payroll tax extension is not that much money for anyone. For a year, it\u2019s about $1,000 for the average American. \u2026 So the point is that this isn\u2019t really the way to go about good tax reform. We just want to make sure that over the year, in the economy we\u2019re in, we\u2019re not taking money out of those pockets. But what we\u2019re working for is good, sustainable tax reform that\u2019s flatter, fairer, that really is much simpler, and this will just lead up to that. So I\u2019m for this in the sense that I don\u2019t want to do any more harm to anyone. But the real goal here is good tax reform that we can all work on.\n\nHer fuller comments also make clear that Ellmers believed an extension of the payroll tax cut was critical as the country continued to struggle to get out of a recession.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to give the people of North Carolina that reassurance moving forward into 2012 that they\u2019re going to keep that money in their pockets,\u201d Ellmers said.\n\nIn rejecting the Senate plan, House Republicans were pushing for a year-long extension, and had hoped to include provisions to pay for it with higher Medicare premiums on upper-income senior citizens, as well as a measure to fast-track a decision on the Keystone XL oil pipeline.\n\nBut two days later, House Republicans relented and unanimously agreed to a two-month extension, with the promise of negotiating a longer-term agreement early in 2012. And, in fact, as a conference committee member, Ellmers helped to craft a compromise agreement in February 2012 to extend the payroll tax cut until the end of 2012. Ellmers, of course, voted for that bill.\n\nThe payroll tax holiday was allowed to expire at the end of 2012, with neither Republicans nor Democrats fighting for its inclusion in the so-called fiscal cliff deal reached in January 2013.\n\nFighting for Bragg Air Wing\n\nIn the ad, Aiken also criticizes Ellmers because \u201cshe didn\u2019t stop a Fort Bragg Air Wing from being moved out of state, which will hurt our local economy.\u201d\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t for lack of trying on Ellmers\u2019 part.\n\nAfter President Obama\u2019s 2015 budget proposal called for deactivating the 440th Airlift Wing at Fort Bragg as a cost-cutting measure, Ellmers joined a bipartisan group from the North Carolina delegation that sent a letter in March to Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel and Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Martin Dempsey urging them to reconsider. The following month, Ellmers made a similar appeal during testimony at a House Armed Services Committee.\n\nAnd in May, Ellmers introduced an amendment to the 2015 defense authorization bill to spare Fort Bragg\u2019s 440th Airlift Wing from being deactivated or relocated. The amendment was co-sponsored by a bipartisan group of North Carolina congressmen, Democratic Reps. David Price and Mike McIntyre and Republican Rep. Richard Hudson.\n\nIn its support for the ad, the Aiken campaign argues that it\u2019s not so much that Ellmers hasn\u2019t advocated for saving the airlift wing, it\u2019s that she botched those efforts. The Aiken campaign cited a May 22 story in the Fayetteville Observer that said Ellmers\u2019 amendment \u201cwas submitted late, according to the House Armed Services Committee.\u201d\n\nThe Rules Committee website does, in fact, note that Ellmers\u2019 amendment was filed late. But that\u2019s not as calamitous as it sounds. The fact that it was filed late did not preclude it from being considered. There were 322 amendments to the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2015 submitted for consideration. Of them, 32 are listed as \u201clate\u201d \u2014 most of them later than Ellmers\u2019 proposed amendment \u2014 and yet 15 of them were \u201cmade in order,\u201d meaning they were allowed by the Rules Committee to be voted on by the full House. The Rules Committee decided not to allow Ellmers\u2019 amendment to be debated on the floor and voted on.\n\n\u201cTypically, we mark amendments when they have been submitted late,\u201d a Rules Committee spokesman told us in a phone interview. \u201cBut the fact that it is late does not have any bearing on whether it is \u2018made in order\u2019 or not. The lateness factor does not preclude an amendment.\u201d\n\nSo why did the Rules Committee decide not to allow the Ellmers amendment to move forward? There were hundreds of amendments to the NDAA, the spokesman said, and \u201cwe don\u2019t normally get into why a particular amendment is \u2018made in order\u2019 or not.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not sure why the Rules Committee rejected it,\u201d said Lawrence Kluttz, a spokesman for Price, a Democrat who co-sponsored the amendment. \u201cBut it was not because it was submitted late. There were other amendments submitted late that were allowed to be considered on the floor.\u201d\n\nThe ad also makes it sound like the airlift wing already has been moved out of the state, and that hasn\u2019t happened \u2014 at least not yet.\n\n\u201cNumber one, it\u2019s still there,\u201d Patrick Sebastian, an Ellmers campaign spokesman told us in a phone interview. \u201cFor Aiken to act as if the airlift is gone, he doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s saying. Whatever happens in the future happens, but [Ellmers] is working hard with other legislators in North Carolina to keep the airlift wing in North Carolina.\u201d\n\nAn amendment authored in the Senate by Democratic Sen. Kay Hagan has at least delayed the proposed move until 60 days after the Air Force provides justification for it.\n\nIn the same interview highlighted in the ad, Ellmers vowed that despite the failure of her proposed amendment, she would keep up the fight.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going to let this issue go. I feel very strongly \u2013 that not only for military readiness, but also to the economy of the Fayetteville area is dependent on that unit staying together,\u201d Ellmers told TWCN.\n\n\u2013 Robert Farley", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Following post first appeared on Fa...", "sailthru.expire_date": "2014-10-22 17:52:02 -0400", "og": {"site_name": "The Huffington Post", "description": "The Following post first appeared on Fa...", "title": "Clay Aiken's Latest Attack Ad Is Off Key", "url": "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/10/21/clay-aiken-congress_n_6024190.html", "image": "http://i.huffpost.com/gen/2192578/images/o-CLAY-AIKEN-facebook.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"width": 2000, "identifier": "http://i.huffpost.com/gen/2192578/images/o-CLAY-AIKEN-facebook.jpg", "height": 1000}, "description": "The Following post first appeared on Fa...", "site": "@HuffPostPol", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Clay Aiken's Latest Attack Ad Is Off Key"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-10-21 17:52:02 -0400", "al": {"ios": {"url": "huffpostnews:///?editionID=us&entryID=6024190", "app_store_id": 306621789, "app_name": "The Huffington Post"}}, "taboola.category": "politics", "fb": {"app_id": 46744042133}, "keywords": "clay aiken congress,Clay Aiken,clay aiken renee elmers,clay aiken campaign,clay aiken north carolina,clay aiken congressional run", "article": {"section": "Politics", "tag": "clay aiken congress,Clay Aiken,clay aiken renee elmers,clay aiken campaign,clay aiken north carolina,clay aiken congressional run", "published_time": "2014-10-21 17:52:02 -0400", "modified_time": "2014-10-21 18:59:01 -0400"}, "viewport": "width=1000"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd4003\"", "article_summary": "The payroll tax holiday enacted in 2011 reduced the employee share of the Social Security payroll tax from 6.2 percent to 4.2 percent.\nClay Aiken\u2019s latest attack ad against incumbent Republican Rep.
