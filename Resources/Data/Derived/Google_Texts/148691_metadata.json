The bill would legalize physician-assisted suicide in California.\n\n\"The Quality of Life\" follows two very different couples meeting up in Northern California after major life traumas.\n\nOne is a conservative religious couple from the Midwest. The other, hippie spiritualists, have lost their home in a wildfire and are living in a yurt. Values and world perspectives clash, but not without establishing common ground.\n\nThe play was written by Jane Anderson, who has won Emmy Awards for her television writing and wrote for the critically-acclaimed AMC show \"Mad Men.\"\n\nDespite all the serious topics, Yael-Cox said the drama is not a downer.\n\n\"Believe it or not, it\u2019s an incredibly funny play in the most beautiful way because Jane Anderson explores how human we are in crisis,\" Yael-Cox said.\n\nIntrepid is currently in lease negotiations to build a permanent home and theater space in Encinitas.\n\n\"The Quality of Life\" opens July 3 and runs through Aug. 2 at Intrepid's temporary space at the Carlsbad Village Theatre in Carlsbad.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Topics facing the baby boomer generation are finding their way to the stage.
