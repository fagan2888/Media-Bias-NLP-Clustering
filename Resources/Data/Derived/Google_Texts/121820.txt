After resigning from his radio show last week amid rumors of an ongoing investigation, former Republican governor of Connecticut John Rowland was indicted on federal charges on Friday for allegedly attempting to conceal his paid work on two separate congressional campaigns.

The indictment by a New Haven grand jury is on seven counts. It alleges that in 2009-2010, Rowland did paid work for a congressional candidate in Connecticut’s 5th District without informing either his radio show audience or the FEC. It also alleges that in 2011-2012, Rowland pulled a similar move, this time receiving money for pretending to do work at a nursing home owned by the husband of candidate Lisa Wilson-Foley.

According to the indictment, Wilson-Foley wanted Rowland’s help but worried that, given his previous incidents with the law (for which he served 10 months in prison), associating him with her campaign would bring negative repercussions. For his part, Rowland wrote in an email that he “want[ed] to stay under the radar as much as possible.” Rowland is alleged to have ultimately received $35,000 from the campaign, money he did not disclose to the FEC.
