(REUTERS/Tony Gentile)\n\n4724190\n\nPope Francis had time in Washington Wednesday evening to meet with the Little Sisters of the Poor, a religious order that is suing over Obamacare\u2019s contraception mandate.\n\nAccording to Vatican spokesman Fr. Federico Lombardi, the pope made an unscheduled stop to meet with the Little Sisters. The order, which operates health care centers for the impoverished elderly, is fighting the Affordable Care Act\u2019s requirement for employers to pay for their employees\u2019 contraception despite the Catholic Church\u2019s opposition to birth control. The case may go to the Supreme Court in the coming judicial term.\n\nBoth Francis and President Barack Obama alluded to the U.S.\u2019 cherished value of religious freedom when they met at the White House Wednesday morning. But for the country\u2019s Catholic leaders, the administration\u2019s implementation of the health care law fails to recognize the Church\u2019s right to follow its conscience.

It is likely that he visited the order just after celebrating an enormous canonization mass at the Basilica, attended by many thousands.

But at the White House, he instead focused on climate change and immigration \u2014 issues on which he is seen as in line with Obama \u2014 along with religious liberty.\n\nThe pope will address Congress Thursday morning. He will then travel to New York and Philadelphia, returning to Rome Sunday.\n\nFollow Ivan Plis on Twitter\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
