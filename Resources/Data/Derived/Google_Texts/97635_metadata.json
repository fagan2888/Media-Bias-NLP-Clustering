Gunn challenges the perceived notion of the free market being responsible for the high prices in healthcare, revealing government intervention as the actual ailment. Covering much more than just ObamaCare, Wait Till It\u2019s Free examines the history, ramifications, and practical alternatives to government-directed healthcare.\n\nWhereas in Indoctrination, Colin Gunn drove around in a school bus as the framework of the movie, this time he uses the interactions of customers and workers in a small diner to illustrate the causes, problems, and viable solutions to healthcare in the United States.\n\nHigh-cost Healthcare\n\nThe film opens with the emotional story of Jeff and Kelle Swanson, in rural Shelby, Michigan. When their youngest daughter, Claudia, was born, the doctors noticed what they thought was a smudge on her back. Claudia was diagnosed with spina bifida, a birth defect caused when the embryonic neural tube fails to close. Jeff, who serves as the pastor of a local church and is uninsured, was told that his daughter required an MRI, which they agreed to have done, under the impression that it would cost only $3,000, as the hospital told them. The Swansons were shocked when their bill arrived with a total amount due of $20,430.66. To make matters worse, additional bills arrived, one from the radiologist and another from the anesthesiologist. When all was said and done, the total cost of their bills summed up to a staggering $300,000.\n\nThe Swansons\u2019 experience is not unique, as Gunn points out, citing the example of another uninsured man\u2019s MRI bill in Illinois that totaled over $70,000. The high cost of health insurance makes it unaffordable for many self-employed Americans, including Gunn, as he demonstrates with a touch of amusement when he attempts to purchase health insurance for his family, which includes his pregnant wife and their eight children.\n\n\u201cSo this is the story. As Americans, all of us face these problems. Even if you have insurance you can lose it,\u201d says Gunn as he is seen walking into a diner and making his way to a booth. As a waitress walks up to take his order, Gunn proceeds to ask why healthcare is so expensive, unlike food, another basic necessity in America.\n\nGunn\u2019s search for answers first takes him to New York City, where he interviews journalist Steven Brill, whose extensive research about the high cost and money behind healthcare was published in Time magazine.\n\n\u201cThe buyer has no power,\u201d Brill says, revealing that hospital services are so costly, especially for the uninsured, because of what is known as the \u201ccharge-master.\u201d The charge-master records all the prices charged by a particular hospital. It contains separate lists of prices for every procedure and medicine, for both the insured and uninsured. Those patients who are charged the highest prices, Brill explains, are the uninsured who are not poor enough to qualify for Medicaid. Because they have no economic leverage, they are charged the charge-master\u2019s highest rate. For example, patients who have Medicaid were charged $14 for a blood test by a particular hospital, while those without Medicaid or any other insurance were charged $280 for the same test at the same hospital.\n\nBrill calls this price scheme \u201cirrational.\u201d Those fortunate enough to have Medicaid, or be able to afford private insurance, are charged a supposedly discounted rate, which the health insurance companies are then able to advertise as a \u201csavings,\u201d an incentive to purchase health insurance.\n\n\u201cIf you have no insurance and end up in a hospital, you\u2019re charged the charge-master prices, and then the hospital, if you complain, will act like a good guy and give you a 30-percent discount off of the charge-master\u2019s,\u201d Brill says. This is what the Swansons experienced when Jeff went through the ordeal of negotiating with the hospital, with the hopes of significantly lowering his cost. Although Swanson was willing to pay more than what Medicaid would, but not substantially more, the hospital told him that they would reduce his bill by 20 percent only if he paid the remainder fully in cash.\n\nTo stop rising healthcare costs, conventional wisdom suggests government intervene further into healthcare and completely take it over, i.e., a single-payer system. However, Gunn reveals the opposite is true, or in the words of President Ronald Reagan: \u201cGovernment is not the solution to our problem; government is the problem.\u201d\n\nGunn\u2019s quest for answers then led him to British-born Dr. Tony Dale, a physician and founder of the Karis Group. Dr. Dale reinforced Brill\u2019s findings: \u201cPeople least able to pay the cost of medical care, namely people paying out of pocket, were actually the people being charged by far the most for the care they were being given.\u201d Hospitals, private insurance companies, and the government are able to get away with this because of what Dale calls \u201cprice distortion\u201d directly resulting from a lack of \u201cprice transparency,\u201d as in the case of the Swansons. Dr. Dale, too, asserts that free market capitalism is not the problem; it\u2019s the solution that\u2019s been gradually pushed out by the government.\n\n\u201cPeople tend to criticize the American system by saying \u2018it\u2019s too capitalistic.\u2019 My response is that the American system is barely capitalistic at all. You hardly see the effects of free-enterprise because there is so much distortion to the system by how involved the government already is in the whole process,\u201d says Dr. Dale.\n\nBack at the diner, Gunn shows two families eating in side-by-side booths. The first is the modern family, which pays about 16 percent of its annual income, or $9,000, for healthcare. The second family, depicted in black and white, represents the generation of the first family\u2019s grandparents, who would have paid about five percent of their annual income, or $2,000 in today\u2019s dollars, in healthcare costs. In addition to the modern advancements and discoveries made in medical science, the difference between the two generations of families, relative to healthcare cost, is the amount government has actively intervened in the health field during that time. Starting in 1935 with a proposal for a national health insurance system as part of FDR\u2019s New Deal, which never went through, Gunn chronologically highlights the government\u2019s gradual intervention and socialization of healthcare, culminating in 2010 with the passage of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, more commonly known as ObamaCare.\n\nGunn then traveled to Texas to interview former congressman and medical doctor Ron Paul for his take on the issue. \u201cPrices go up in the areas where the government gets most involved. When they inflate a currency \u2014 that\u2019s printing too much money \u2014 all prices, wages, and salaries don\u2019t go up evenly,\u201d Dr. Paul explained. He further elaborates:\n\nSome things that the government\u2019s more involved in push prices up much faster. So the government is involved in education, so the cost goes up much faster. They\u2019re involved in medical care, so that\u2019s why the price inflation of medical care is so much higher than anything else because of the government. And they can\u2019t possibly solve this problem by being more involved and promising more things that they can\u2019t afford.\n\nThe solution, according to Ron Paul, is the free market. \u201cThe market is just begging and pleading to help out and yet all we get from Washington is obstructionism,\u201d Paul said.\n\nGovernment as Interloper\n\nAnother expert Gunn consults in the film is Dr. Curtis Caine, who has been a licensed medical doctor for over 65 years and is also the director of the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons. Dr. Caine tells Gunn:\n\nThe only important entity in the whole deal is the patient. Without a patient you don\u2019t need a helicopter, you don\u2019t need a hospital, you don\u2019t need a drug company. The only entity in the whole deal that is of any consequence is relegated to being the excuse for what\u2019s done and is actually just in the way. And for some person or entity to stick his Pinocchio nose between me and my employer, my individual patient, that person or entity is an interloper. [Emphasis added.]\n\nGunn illustrates the \u201cinterloper\u201d as a man who enters a diner and sits down next to another person who has just received his order of a burger with fries. The interloper starts out by nonchalantly reaching over, taking, and eating a fry from the other person\u2019s plate. Apparently unsatisfied with the fries, the interloper takes a bottle of salt and sprinkles it over the other person\u2019s fries. The food purchaser is not happy but doesn\u2019t stop him, so the interloper finishes what he started and proceeds to take the entire plate, setting it before himself while chewing a bite from the person\u2019s hamburger. As comical as the scene is, it is exactly what the government is doing to American\u2019s individual healthcare.\n\nYet government is not done interloping. ObamaCare is not what President Obama and his Democrat friends wanted. Originally the goal was, and likely remains, a full single-payer system similar to that which Gunn experienced in his native homeland of Scotland. Halfway through the film, Gunn travels to Scotland, where he details how Britain\u2019s national single-payer healthcare system, the National Health Service (NHS), is nothing more than \u201cRubbish!\u201d as one woman describes it in the streets of Glasgow.\n\nLiberty in Healthcare\n\nGunn devotes the final third of the film to solutions, the various alternatives to government healthcare. One of the alternatives suggested is true price transparency, as put into practice by Dr. Keith Smith, who runs a private surgery center in Oklahoma. In 1997, Dr. Smith bought an old, mismanaged surgery center that had been through a fire in Oklahoma City and turned it into something that \u201cwould be different in a couple of ways.\u201d Most importantly, Smith and his partners \u201cwould practice price honesty. We put our prices online partly to expose the cartel in the price-fixing that was going on.\u201d (Emphasis added.)\n\nUnlike the charge-master with the hidden prices, which leaves the uninsured at the mercy of inflated hospital fees, what Dr. Smith accomplished is just the opposite. Smith\u2019s surgery center instead practices price transparency. Prospective patients or curious parties can go to the surgery center\u2019s website at www.surgerycenterok.com and find what the actual cost of a surgery will be, simply by clicking on an area of the human body displayed on the screen. Clicking on this diagram gives individuals the option to scroll and choose the specific procedure desired and then display the price.\n\n\u201cIn six months we knew that the prices we were quoting to patients were many times a tenth of what the so-called not-for-profit hospitals that we had just left claimed were bankrupting them,\u201d Dr. Smith says. \u201cWe knew very very soon that we were right.\u201d Amazingly the first patients to arrive were Canadians, who already possess the same socialized, single-payer healthcare system pursued by those here in the U.S. government.\n\nDr. Smith and the Oklahoma Surgery Center have escaped the government system by simply refusing to take Medicaid, Medicare, and any other form of third-party insurance. They were liberated by acting simply as though the government did not exist. According to the surgery center\u2019s website:\n\nTo keep prices as low as possible, cashier\u2019s checks or cash are the methods preferred. Credit cards are accepted with the appropriate percentage the company charges us added on the price. Human resource departments or divisions of self-insured companies can make other arrangements if necessary.\n\nAnother physician who liberated herself from the government healthcare trap is Dr. Juliette Dersch, an internist and pediatrician in Marble Falls, Texas. Dr. Dersch runs an old-fashioned, fee-for-service medical practice that also does not take any government money or other third-party payments, and she still makes house calls to her patients. This approach has helped her restore the doctor-patient relationship that is virtually non-existent in the modern government-managed healthcare industry.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not responsible to a health insurance company. I\u2019m not responsible to the government. I\u2019m only responsible to the patient. Plus in doing so, I can do whatever I want,\u201d Dr. Dersch explains. \u201cWe give a discount to teachers and preachers, we see foster kids for free, we see people who have cancer absolutely for free.\u201d Because Dr. Dersch does not accept Medicaid, she is free to charge her patients far less than the set reimbursement rate that hospitals charge, and she is also able to be as charitable as she chooses.\n\nAnother solution Gunn examines is Samaritan Ministries, a self-described \u201cBiblical, non-insurance approach to health care needs.\u201d Samaritan Ministries is guided by the biblical principles of Galatians chapter six: \u201cBear ye one another\u2019s burdens\u201d and that \u201cevery man shall bear his own burden.\u201d Samaritan coordinates its members to share the cost of one another\u2019s medical bills that are too much to bear alone. First, members send copies of their medical bills to Samaritan. Samaritan then publishes or shares the bills with other members, who in turn send personal checks directly to the member with the need, covering the total cost. Unlike insurance companies, Samaritan never handles the money. This cost-sharing method assures that each member\u2019s costs are met without the high premiums or deductibles of third-party payments. In fact it was by becoming members of Samaritan Ministries that the Swansons were able to have their bills for Claudia\u2019s care paid in full.\n\nCost transparency, individual charity as practiced by Doctors Smith and Dersch, and cost-sharing methods such as Samaritan Ministries are the very antithesis and answer to the government healthcare system.\n\nThis is what Gunn\u2019s film wonderfully presents. Phenomenally well made and thought provoking, with expert testimonies and a healthy dose of humor, Wait Till It\u2019s Free is the perfect prescription to Michael Moore\u2019s Sicko and our nation\u2019s healthcare system as a whole.\n\nTo order the DVD Wait Till It's Free, click here.\n\nRelated articles/videos:\n\nObamaCare to Cost $2 Trillion to Cover Fewer Than Half of Uninsured\n\nColin Gunn's Lessons from His Documentary ''Wait Till It's Free'' (Video)\n\nObama Advisor Gruber in 2009/ ObamaCare Unaffordable, Rationing (a.k.a.
