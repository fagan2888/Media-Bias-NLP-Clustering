Specifically, they evaluated pornography\u2019s influence on sex trafficking, child exploitation and sexual violence.\n\n\u201cThis is not only a public health issue, it is a social justice issue,\u201d said Cordelia Anderson, founder of Sensibilities Prevention Services. \u201cIt\u2019s not the sex that\u2019s the problem, it\u2019s the violence. It\u2019s not the nudity that\u2019s the problem, it\u2019s the novelty.\u201d\n\nThe panel identified ways pornography contributes to violence against women. According to a 2010 study published in Violence Against Women, nearly 90 percent of 304 pornographic scenes evaluated by experts included physical aggression including spanking, gagging and slapping. Recipients of these violent misdemeanors were most frequently women.\n\nAdditionally, multiple studies were cited indicating increased rates of behavioral violence and aggression against women and children among men who view pornography.\n\nBut pornography is a more serious issue than many initially perceive. Melissa Farley, executive director at Prostitution Research and Education, compared pornography to prostitution and sex trafficking.\n\n\u201cThe same kinds of violence against women are perpetrated in pornography, prostitution and trafficking,\u201d Farley said. \u201cDisconnecting trafficking from prostitution and pornography normalizes most of the sex industry.\u201d\n\nFarley said pornography is a business enterprise \u2014 the industry documents sexual assaults of individuals and then makes a profit from those misdemeanors as a result. But because pornography is legal, it is more difficult to tackle, expose and take action against the offenses than those of prostitution and sex trafficking.\n\nFurthermore, these violent images are reaching increased demographics and influencing cultural attitudes and behaviors.\n\n\u201cWe believe that this is an issue that calls out, cries out, for leadership,\u201d Ernie Allen, former president and CEO of the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children and International Centre for Missing and Exploited Children. \u201cThe developing brains of younger and younger children are being bombarded by graphic, dehumanizing images.\u201d\n\nAccording to Mary Anne Layden, director of the Sexual Trauma and Psychopathology Program Center for Cognitive Therapy at the University of Pennsylvania, pornography is molding children\u2019s sexual attitudes and behaviors that carry over into adulthood.\n\nAs a result, typical messages children receive include that sex is casual and not about intimacy, love or respect; sex is not about marriage or having children; and there is no such thing as too much sex.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s because the sex industry is giving them sexual junk food,\u201d Layden said. \u201cIf you eat the sexual junk food, you may become sexually obese.\u201d\n\nPornography normalizes violent and abusive sexual acts, Layden said. As a result, men who are \u201csexually obese\u201d tend to think women enjoy rape, have a greater desire for sex without emotional connection and rank higher on psychopath test scores.\n\nAdditionally, these men are more likely to engage in extramarital affairs and seek prostitutes, while \u201csexually obese\u201d women are more likely to believe in softer punishments for rapists, have greater levels of low body self-esteem and are more likely to be victims of non-consenting sex.\n\n\u201cThe commonality of all of these is that pornography provides a slippery slope to exploitation and abuse,\u201d said Ed Smart, father of kidnap victim Elizabeth Smart and director of Prevention and Rehabilitation at Operation Underground Railroad.\n\nIn order to combat this problem, Allen referenced default filtering, a tactic used in Britain by David Cameron that is automatically applied to all households. Customers can then proceed to continue using the filter or deactivate it.\n\n\u201cOut of that model, I think there may be a solution, there might be a way forward,\u201d Allen said. \u201cWe can do something about this and it does not necessarily require legislation, although legislation would be great.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "A panel evaluates porn's contributions to abuse and violence.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "A panel evaluates porn's contributions to abuse and violence.", "title": "Is This the Real War on Women?
