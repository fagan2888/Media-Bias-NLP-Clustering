In fact, no other county in New England has such a high rate of people without health insurance. Neither does any county in New York state or Pennsylvania. In fact, you would have to go all the way to the southern tip of West Virginia before you can find such a high rate.\n\nThe map changes dramatically, however, when you get into the states of the old Confederacy. North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, Tennessee, Florida and Texas all average rates of uninsurance at or above Washington County\u2019s levels. This is not just a quirk of history or geography. This is the result of policy choices made in Republican-controlled states of the Old South that rejected Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act, and as a result have chosen to put their residents\u2019 lives at risk.\n\nSince Maine is the only state in the Northeast to have made that choice, its poor are suffering along with the people who live in the southern part of the country.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act has succeeded in reducing the number of people without health insurance, but the data show the improvement hasn\u2019t been distributed equally. The optional Medicaid expansion helps people with incomes below 138 percent of the federal poverty line (or about $16,000 a year for an individual), who work in jobs that rarely provide health benefits.\n\nIn Maine, an estimated 70,000 people would have been able to obtain affordable health care if the state had accepted the federal funds.\n\nIt\u2019s important to remember that this is not just about insurance, it\u2019s also about health.\n\nPeople without insurance are less healthy than people with coverage. Thousands of avoidable deaths every year result from undetected cancers, mismanaged chronic conditions and lack of access to life-saving medical procedures. Millions of dollars are wasted in lost productivity, charity care and bad debt.\n\nThe rejection of the almost entirely federally funded Medicaid expansion results from a hatred of federal authority that has festered in the South since it was invaded and occupied by a victorious federal army a century and a half ago.\n\nGiven Maine\u2019s history as a part of that force, its ideological alliance with the Southern states makes as little sense from a historical perspective as it does from an economic and humanitarian one.\n\nMaine should not fight this common-sense medical reform any longer. It\u2019s time to rejoin the Union, and expand Medicaid.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Washington County is the only one north of the Mason-Dixon line with 14 percent of its residents uninsured.", "generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Central Maine", "description": "Washington County is the only one north of the Mason-Dixon line with 14 percent of its residents uninsured.", "title": "OUR OPINION: Map of uninsured puts Maine county in Confederacy - Central Maine", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 999, "identifier": "http://www.centralmaine.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/447094_3edit_OurOpinionMS-KJ_250px.jpg", "height": 911}, "updated_time": "2015-11-02T18:11:43-04:00", "url": "http://www.centralmaine.com/2015/11/03/map-of-uninsured-puts-maine-county-in-confederacy/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.centralmaine.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/447094_3edit_OurOpinionMS-KJ_250px.jpg", "description": "Washington County is the only one north of the Mason-Dixon line with 14 percent of its residents uninsured.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "OUR OPINION: Map of uninsured puts Maine county in Confederacy - Central Maine"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=966680591", "fb": {"app_id": 754222714628811}, "google-site-verification": "DT-FwcrUrXtAltcTNXUsA7tR4Ha0CLErawYbGlkpg94", "article": {"section": "Editorials", "tag": "ouropinion", "published_time": "2015-11-03T04:10:00-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-11-02T18:11:43-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2769\"", "article_summary": "In fact, no other county in New England has such a high rate of people without health insurance.\nWashington County has the highest rate of uninsured residents in Maine \u2014 14 percent \u2014 as opposed to 9 percent in Cumberland County and 8 percent in York.\nNeither does any county in New York state or Pennsylvania.\nIn Maine, an estimated 70,000 people would have been able to obtain affordable health care if the state had accepted the federal funds.\nThe Affordable Care Act has succeeded in reducing the number of people without health insurance, but the data show the improvement hasn\u2019t been distributed equally."}
