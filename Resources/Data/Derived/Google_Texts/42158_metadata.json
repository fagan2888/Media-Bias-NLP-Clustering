Wayne\u2019s web site: ROOTforAmerica.com .\n\nBranding is even more important in politics than the business world.\n\nMy message to the GOP: Brand Hillary Clinton right now. Before she brands herself. Before she becomes too big to fail. Before she becomes \u201cinevitable.\u201d Before it\u2019s a foregone conclusion that the first female president will follow the first black president.\n\nIt\u2019s all or nothing for the Democratic Party in 2016. It\u2019s Hillary or bust. She has a 61-point lead\u2026the biggest lead in Democratic presidential poll history.\n\n\n\nThere are no other contenders. Destroy Hillary now and it\u2019s over.\n\nTurn her into \u201cHillary \u201cWhat Difference Does It Make\u201d Clinton. Share:\n\nWhat are they left with? Joe \u201cCrazy Uncle\u201d Biden? Elizabeth \u201cI\u2019m an Indian\u201d Warren? The Democrats have nothing but Hillary. Take Hillary down now, before she gets started, and the GOP has a huge advantage in 2016.\n\nFor Hillary Clinton it\u2019s already started. Her own BFF (Best Friend Forever), the late Diane Blair just branded her as \u201cruthless\u201d in papers published after Blair\u2019s death in 2000. Well maybe the GOP needs to take a few lessons in \u201cruthless\u201d from Hillary.\n\nI travel the world lecturing about branding. I recently returned from a 16-day, four-city tour of South Africa where I taught \u201cBranding, American Style.\u201d I\u2019ve sold hundreds of millions of dollars of different products on TV, radio, infomercials and web. I understand branding.\n\nBranding works. Why isn\u2019t it already being done? Can Republicans be this stupid and dense? Anyone can see it. You\u2019d have to be blind. Heck, the GOP has already seen it done to themselves, up close and personal.\n\n\u201cTeam Obama\u201d branded Mitt Romney for months in the spring and summer of 2012. Romney sat on the sidelines and waited\u2026and waited\u2026and lost the presidency. It was too late. He was already branded as \u201ca rich, white, out of touch, business mogul who fires employees and hates poor people.\u201d\n\nBut hey, that\u2019s okay. All is fair in love, war and politics. That\u2019s what branding is for. So what is the GOP waiting for?\n\nThe Democrats are facing a landslide defeat in 2014 because of Obamacare. If Hillary is defeated now, the Democrats will be out of luck in 2016 too.\n\nWhat do they brand Hillary with? Well for once Karl Rove is right.\n\nYou don\u2019t brand her with Monica Lewinsky or old Bill Clinton scandals. That\u2019s old news. The voters don\u2019t care about what happened in the 90\u2032s.\n\nBut I know exactly how to brand Hillary.\n\nDo you remember her Congressional hearings over the Benghazi disaster? Hillary famously said, \u201cWhat difference does it make?\u201d when referring to four dead American heroes. Make her own that brand. \u201cWhat difference does it make\u201d should become Hillary\u2019s middle name.\n\nRun \u201cWhat difference does it make\u201d ad campaigns on TV and radio 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Repeat it so much that you can\u2019t say Hillary, without finishing the sentence with \u201cWhat difference does it make?\u201d\n\nStart with Benghazi. Hillary was in charge. Bury her \u201cbrand\u201d by using her own TV ads from 2008. During the Benghazi attack the red phone rang at 2 a.m., just like those ads promised. Hillary answered. When she heard the U.S. Embassy was under attack, did she say, \u201cWhat difference does it make?\u201d Four American heroes died because of her indifference.\n\nHer actions made a big difference at Benghazi. But not in a positive way. The branding campaign should ask where was Hillary when the embassy desperately needed military rescue? Why did she refuse to mount a rescue? Why did she let those brave men die?\n\nRemember when Obama compared Trayvon Martin to the sons he never had. Well if one of those Navy Seals was her son, would Hillary have said \u201cno\u201d to a rescue attempt? If it was her son, would she have said, \u201cWhat difference does it make?\u201d\n\nAnother round of branding ads should ask why Hillary participated in a cover-up. When did she realize the cover story told by Obama, herself and Susan Rice was a lie? Ask her if she still thinks a \u201cspontaneous protest\u201d over a movie that no one ever watched caused the embassy attack?\n\nThrow in scenes of the entire Middle East in flames. Tahrir Square burning in Cairo. Libya in flames. Syrian children laying dead in the streets. Venezuela\u2019s leader laughing at us. North Korea negotiating with\u2026Dennis Rodman. That all happened with Hillary as Secretary of State. Ask voters \u201cWhat difference did she make as Secretary of State?\u201d\n\nThen move to Obamacare. It\u2019s destroying jobs. It\u2019s damaging the economy. It\u2019s crippling small business.\n\n\u201cWhat difference does it make?\u201d Well plenty, if it\u2019s your business.\n\nCancer patients are losing their health insurance, or their doctors, or the drugs that keep them alive. Ask \u201cWhat difference does it make?\u201d Well plenty, if the cancer victim is your child.\n\nMiddle class jobs are being destroyed by the millions by Obamacare. The Congressional Budget Office predicts 2.3 million jobs will be lost. The CBO says Obamacare kills the incentive to work. \u201cWhat difference does it make?\u201d Well plenty, if it\u2019s your job that just got eliminated, or cut down to part time.\n\nAsk Hillary where she stands now on Obamacare? Does she support it? Does she want government to get even more intrusive? How intrusive? Like a proctologist with his finger up our\u2026wallet? Let\u2019s see what America thinks of that idea. Let\u2019s ask America \u201cWhat difference does it make, if government gets even more involved in health care under Hillary Clinton?\u201d\n\nBrand that all over national TV and radio now\u2026before Hillary\u2019s presidential campaign ever starts. Run the ads day and night in battleground states. The result? Hillary\u2019s presidential ambitions will be toast. That 61-point lead is 100 miles wide and only a half inch thick. Without Hillary, the Democrats have nothing in 2016.\n\nThat\u2019s how you use branding to destroy Hillary\u2019s campaign before it starts. To poison Hillary\u2019s brand. Turn her into \u201cHillary \u201cWhat Difference Does It Make\u201d Clinton.\n\nDo that, and soon Hillary will find out what difference four dead heroes on her watch makes. And what difference millions of lost health insurance policies make. And what difference a lie like \u201cif you like your insurance, you can keep it\u201d makes. And what difference 2.3 million lost jobs makes.\n\nMake her run on Benghazi, Obamacare and Obama\u2019s economy, and Hillary will soon find out what difference it all makes.\n\nWhen it comes to the presidency\u2026branding makes all the difference in the world.\n\n\u2013\n\nTheBlaze contributor channel supports an open discourse on a range of views.
