GOELTA, Calif. -

A new permanent Santa Barbara Neighborhood Clinic is now up and running in Goleta.

A ribbon cutting ceremony celebrated the new clinic last Friday which serves many people on low incomes or under-insured.

The clinic was established with funds from a federal grant included in the Affordable Care Act.

The clinic moved from a smaller building in Goleta. Staff say this new building is much larger and will better accommodate serving the community.

The new facility is dedicated to providing quality, affordable care throughout the greater Santa Barbara community.
