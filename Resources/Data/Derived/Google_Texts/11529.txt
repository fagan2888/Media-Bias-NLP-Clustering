Emmanuel Sanders can now change his title to “Broncos receiver/actor.”

Von Miller had hinted this day would come when he was asked last week if the Broncos would be a good fit for HBO’s “Hard Knocks.”

“We have a lot of guys that love the cameras, especially Emmanuel. He does the TV show during the season and all that stuff. I don’t know. I think it’s good that we don’t have them yet because Emmanuel — he’s got to get that out of his system,” Miller said jokingly.

Sanders got his time in front of the cameras as an “actor” in “Fandom,” a new film about the wild world of fantasy football. Check out the trailer, above.

And, yes, he’s as pumped as you’d expect him to be.
