BARTLESVILLE, Okla. - Four Oklahoma Christian colleges are suing the Obama administration over the implementation of the federal healthcare law.

The schools joining in the suit are Oklahoma Wesleyan University in Bartlesville, Southern Nazarene University in Bethany, Oklahoma Baptist University in Shawnee and Mid America Christian University in Oklahoma City.

An attorney representing the schools say the part of the law requiring employers to provide their workers with contraceptives, including birth control pills, violates his clients' religious beliefs.

The schools want a federal judge in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma to exempt them from this part of the law.

"The federal government is forcing religious employers, among others, to include in their health insurance plans, drugs and devices that destroy innocent human life," said attorney Greg Baylor.

Baylor is senior counselor at the Christian nonprofit group Alliance Defending Freedom. The organization's attorneys are representing the schools in their suit.

Baylor said the law also violates his clients' First and Fifth Amendment rights.

"The federal government has been unwilling to respect and accommodate their religious freedom and their conscience, so they found it necessary to seek relief in the courts," said Baylor.

There's also the issue of cost.

Companies and organization who don't comply with the law will face big penalties.

"We're talking six to seven figure fines each year and I don't think any institution can sustain that sort of fine," said Baylor.

The president of Oklahoma Wesleyan University in Bartlesville was not available to comment on the suit on Friday.

The federal government has 60 days to respond.
