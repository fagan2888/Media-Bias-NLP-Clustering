According to the agency, the mineral found in breast milk is an essential nutrient for infants. Among its benefits, it helps the body defend against oxidative stress and helps in the regulation of thyroid hormones.\n\nBut in its final rulemaking, which will be published in the Federal Register later this week, the FDA said evidence exists for both deficiency and toxicity of selenium.\n\n\u201cBecause infant formula often serves as a sole source of nutrition for infants, selenium in infant formula is needed to ensure that formula-fed infants are getting this essential nutrient at appropriate levels,\u201d the agency said in a news release.\n\nUnder the rule, 2.0 micrograms of selenium per 100 kilocalories is the minimum level, and 7.0 micrograms per 100 kilocalories is the maximum level of selenium in infant formula.\n\nThe agency said U.S. manufacturers began adding selenium to infant formula after the Institute of Medicine recognized it to be an essential nutrient for infants in 1989.
