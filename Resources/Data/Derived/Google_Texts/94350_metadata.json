Earlier this year, after Moore published a bizarre piece criticizing the Affordable Care Act, Paul Krugman described the conservative as \u201ca guy who has a troubled relationship with facts.\u201d\n\nKrugman added at the time, \u201cI don\u2019t mean that he\u2019s a slick dissembler; I mean that [Moore] seems more or less unable to publish an article without filling it with howlers \u2026 in a way that ends up doing his cause a disservice.\u201d\n\nThis assessment came to mind last night, reading this New York Times report on a bizarre incident involving Moore and a leading Republican presidential candidate.\n\nLast Wednesday, Stephen Moore, a scholar at the Heritage Foundation who is an outspoken supporter of an immigration overhaul, described a recent telephone call with Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin, in which he said Mr. Walker had assured him he had not completely renounced his earlier support for a pathway to citizenship for illegal immigrants. \u201c \u2018I\u2019m not going nativist, I\u2019m pro-immigration,\u2019\u201d Mr. Walker said, according to Mr. Moore\u2019s account of the call to a reporter for The New York Times. On Sunday, after three days of pressure from Mr. Walker\u2019s aides, Mr. Moore said that he had \u201cmisspoken\u201d when recounting his call with Mr. Walker \u2013 and that the call had never actually taken place.\n\nThis one\u2019s a doozy, so let\u2019s back up for a moment and consider how we got to this point.\n\nScott Walker\u2019s position on immigration has been a garbled mess for months. The Republican governor used to be quite moderate on the issue, but as he moved closer to a national campaign, he quickly shifted to the far-right , even going so far as to attack legal immigration.\n\nIn private, however, Walker has hedged on his new-found posture, and in March, the Wisconsin governor reportedly told a New Hampshire audience \u2013 behind closed doors \u2013 that he supports a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants already in the United States.\n\nWalker and his team denied the reports, but added little clarity to his actual position.\n\nWith this in mind, Moore, a reform proponent, told the New York Times last week that he had a recent phone conversation with Walker, and heard directly from the unannounced candidate that he was \u201cnot going nativist\u201d and does not oppose immigration.\n\nThis, of course, raised questions anew within the GOP \u2013 is Walker saying one thing in private and something else in public? Is the governor simply pandering, offering half-hearted promises to the right on a key issue? Moore\u2019s on-the-record comments naturally reinforced fears within the party.\n\nWhich led to yesterday, when Moore reversed course entirely. It\u2019s not that he misunderstood Walker\u2019s comments, the Heritage Foundation economist said, it\u2019s that Moore now says he never even spoke to the governor about immigration at all.\n\nWhich version of the story is true is now anyone\u2019s guess. It\u2019s possible Team Walker pressured Moore to take this new line; it\u2019s possible Moore didn\u2019t have the conversation he claimed to have.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "description": "A leading Republican economist said he had an important conversation with Scott Walker on immigration.
