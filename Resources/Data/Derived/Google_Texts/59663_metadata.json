Of these assignments, the great majority (over 90 percent) featured practices in which newly recruited physicians will be employed, either by hospitals, medical groups, community health centers, academic medical centers or other facilities.\n\nLess than 10% of the recruiting assignments featured independent practice settings, such as partnerships, concierge practices or solo practice settings, down from over 45% in 2004.\n\nEMPLOYED MODEL NOW FIRST CHOICE FOR MOST DOCTORS\n\nThe report strongly suggests that the employed model is almost the only choice for physicians seeking practice opportunities today. However, in our experience, employment also is the first choice for most physicians today. Very few are seeking small, independent practices.\n\nBoth the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and market forces are driving the trend toward larger entities such as integrated hospital systems and consolidated medical groups, which typically employ physicians.\n\nOther proliferating sites of service, such as urgent care centers, retail clinics, and Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs) also typically employ doctors.\n\nWhat this means for the quality of care patients receive is hard to determine. However, the move toward the employment of physicians may affect patient access to physician services.\n\nAccording to a 2012 survey conducted by Merritt Hawkins for The Physicians Foundation, employed physicians see 17 percent fewer patients per day than do practice owners. As more physicians become employees who work set schedules (rather than small business owners) lines to see a physician could get longer.\n\nPRIVATE PRACTICE INCREASINGLY COMPLEX AND REGULATED\n\nPhysicians themselves are seeking employed settings to mitigate financial risks and to avoid the increasingly complex and regulated environment typical of private practice.\n\nOne exception is concierge practice, the only private practice option which appears to be growing in popularity. Merritt Hawkins conducted 32 searches for concierge settings last year, up from only ten such searches two years ago.\n\nIn concierge practices, physicians contract directly with patients for payment, eliminating in whole or in part third party payers such as private insurance companies or government sponsored insurance plans such as Medicare.\n\nPRIMARY CARE PHYSICIANS, ADVANCED PRACTITIONERS IN GREATEST DEMAND\n\nThe report further indicates that for the eighth year in a row, Merritt Hawkins conducted more search assignments for family physicians than for any other type of doctor.\n\nPhysicians specializing in general internal medicine were second on the list, also for the eighth consecutive year.\n\nFamily physicians and other primary care doctors are in increased demand due in part to their expanded role as care coordinators in team-based delivery models such as Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs) and medical homes.\n\nAdvanced practitioners such as physician assistants (PAs) and nurse practitioners (NPs) also are in growing demand, the report indicates. The number of search assignments Merritt Hawkins conducted for PAs and NPs increased by 320% over the last three years.\n\nVALUE-BASED INCENTIVES\n\nThe new report suggests that the use of value-based physician incentives stalled in the last year. In 2013, 39 percent of Merritt Hawkins\u2019 search assignments offering a production bonus featured at least one value-based metric such as high patient satisfaction scores or low hospital readmission rates.\n\nIn 2014, that number dropped to 24 percent, indicating that employers are still struggling to create physician compensation formulas that incorporate both volume and value based metrics, or are hesitating to do so until the terms of such formulas become clearer.\n\nI would be happy to provide Space Coast readers with a copy of Merritt Hawkins\u2019 2014 Review of Physician and Advanced Practitioner Recruiting Incentives.
