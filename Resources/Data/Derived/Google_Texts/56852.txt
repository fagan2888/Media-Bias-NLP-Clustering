Florence — For the seventh consecutive year, the commons area of Florence High School was packed with artists from across Colorado offering a variety of goods to help shoppers complete their holiday gift lists.

The annual Arts and Crafts Fair, on Saturday and Sunday, supports the Howling Husky Pride marching Band. More than 40 vendors showcased woodworks, knitted items, jewelry, handmade cards, lotions and soaps, jams and jellies and more.

Event organizer Luna Nordstrom said this year's fair had the greatest number of vendors since she became the coordinator four years ago.

Proceeds from the event, including the concessions, benefit the band. Nordstrom said the band earns between $3,000 and $4,000 each year, making it possible to help purchase uniforms, instruments, music and other needed items.

Dave Wood, FHS band director, said proceeds from this year's event will help with the band's five-day trip to San Antonio, Texas, in 2015, where they will perform and compete.

"This will be the first band trip in probably five years," said MaKenna Green, drum major for the band.

She said the band members decided to have its own booth at the fair for the first time this year. MaKenna, along with freshmen Emily Ovnicek and Rysa Lancaster, worked tirelessly — between school, homework and sports — during the last week to make FHS-themed ornaments, flower headbands, scarves and other unique items to help their cause.

"This entire craft fair means a lot to the band because its our biggest fundraiser," Rysa said.
