How, if the needle just bobs up and down, does the thread lock in place?\n\nA great GIF reveals what is going on inside the machine as the needle does its little dance:\n\nHBR/Wikimedia Commons\n\nBeneath the needle (as the GIF shows at a very slowed down speed) a hook rotates, capturing the thread from above and looping it around another thread, this one reeling from the bobbin below. The two threads interlock around the layers of fabric, binding them to one another.\n\nSo it's not magic; it's mechanics.
