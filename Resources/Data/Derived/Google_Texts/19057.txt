The phrase “time for some traffic problems in Fort Lee” has earned an infamous place in modern American politics. One year ago it set in motion the closure of access lanes to the George Washington Bridge in the town of Fort Lee causing unprecedented gridlock and threatening the safety of area residents. Today, it has become shorthand for abusive government and the rampant dysfunction at the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. Yet, for all of its shock value, such hubris should not have come as a surprise.

The Port Authority has been dysfunctional for years, with this governor’s office its willing partner. All anyone needs to understand about this agency is that its budget is larger than that of 26 states and that most New Jersey commuters using Port Authority crossings pay more in tolls than in New Jersey state income taxes.

For years now, as chairman of the Assembly Transportation Committee, I used existing laws to try and pry information from the Port Authority on its out-of-control spending, but the agency either made excuses or ignored requests. They acted as though they were above the law.

So when I hear talk of reforming the agency, I agree. However, the Port Authority is in need of more than just one fix here or a remedy there. It is in need of top to bottom reform in almost every aspect of its structure and operation.

The events and revelations over the past year offer a rare opportunity to remake this agency to, once again, serve the public. We must do this right.

There are those who are pressing for immediate passage of a bill to require the Port Authority adhere to the Open Public Records Act. While it sounds like reform, it leaves untouched the structure and the cast of characters that have already managed to avoid disclosure in the face of a legislative inquiry and subpoenas. The same fox will be guarding the hen house.

The fundamental fix has to be a governance fix to prevent problems from happening in the first place.

The legislative inquiry into what happened with the George Washington Bridge access lane closures will continue in an effort to develop a clear understanding of how it happened. As we move toward completing that effort, I have begun to consider the reforms I believe are necessary to ensure this abuse and dysfunction cannot be repeated. Among my ideas:

-- End the Executive Branch monopoly on the appointment of Commissioners. The appointment of Commissioners ought to be shared with the legislature and, perhaps, with the public who funds its operations.

-- Establish a Citizens Advisory Committee.

-- Prohibit the Port Authority from holding a meeting unless adequate notice has actually been provided to the public, and require all meetings be open to the public except under very limited circumstances.

-- Subject the authority to New York’s Freedom of Information Law and New Jersey’s Open Public Records Act.

-- Have the Board of Commissioners select its own chairperson and vice chairperson through a fair and open process.

-- Allow the Board of Commissioners to select an executive director following a thorough and deliberative national search to fill the position and have the executive director select a deputy.

-- Make clear for the first time that the mission of the authority is solely to facilitate the movement of cargo, vehicles and people; and to construct terminal, transportation and other facilities of commerce in the port district.

-- Require a cost-benefit analysis for all proposed projects

-- Require every member of the Board to disclose any conflicts, or the appearance of a conflict, of a personal, financial, ethical or professional nature that could inhibit or be perceived as inhibiting a commissioner from performing their duties in good faith and with due diligence.

-- Require commissioners to file thorough annual financial disclosure statements.

-- Require the agency to hold at least 10 public hearings not less than 60 days prior to adoption of any increase in any fee, toll, charge or fare for the use of the transportation facilities of the Port Authority with at least one hearing is to be held in each county directly affected by the proposed increase, and at least half the hearings scheduled after 6:30 p.m. on a weekday.

-- Require the authority to provide advance notice of any planned project or operation expected to impede the normal operation of any authority facility.

-- Establish a truly independent inspector general.

-- Establish whistleblower protections for authority employees.

The public outrage fueled by that now infamous e-mail, "time for traffic problems in Fort Lee," must be used as a catalyst for change. With the white hot light of scrutiny focused on the Port Authority, we should not settle for half measures in the name of getting something done. Now is the time to be bold and far reaching in our actions. Anything less will simply result in more of the same.
