Jay Nixon (D) has also borne significant criticism for his delayed response to the situation. State Senator Maria Chappelle-Nadal held a photo of Nixon\u2019s head at a Monday protest, with the words \u201cM.I.A. Again!\u201d written over his forehead. One Missouri statehouse reporter tweeted on Wednesday that \u201cThe Where Is Jay Nixon? meme is not new (frequent critique of lawmakers), but gaining new momentum in Ferguson situation.\u201d\n\nMissouri elected officials of both parties have made statements of sympathy and called for investigation, but have done little to quell the violence:\n\nGov. Jay Nixon (D): On Tuesday, Nixon urged civic and faith leaders in North St. Louis County to \u201chave patience for the investigation that is now underway, but be unwavering in our insistence that it be open, thorough and fair,\u201d \u201ckeep the peace, while remaining uncompromising in our expectation that justice must not simply be pursued, but achieved,\u201d and \u201cexpress the anger and frustration that we rightfully feel in a way that respects the living, and honors the memory of the young man we mourn.\u201d A day later, took to Twitter to announce that he was cancelling all planned appearances to visit North St. Louis County on Thursday. He asked for calm urged law enforcement to \u201crespect rights of residents & press,\u201d adding, \u201cSituation in Ferguson does not represent who we are. Must keep the peace, while safeguarding rights of citizens and the press.\u201d\n\n\n\nAs Governor, I'm committed to ensuring pain of last weekend's tragedy does not continue to be compounded by this ongoing crisis. #Ferguson \u2014 Governor Jay Nixon (@GovJayNixon) August 14, 2014\n\nAccording to Bloomberg reports on Twitter early Thursday, Nixon also said he may relieve the St. Louis County police of their duties in Ferguson.\n\nSen. Roy Blunt (R): In a press release on Monday, Blunt grieved the \u201ctragic loss\u201d of Ferguson and urged a full investigation: \u201cEveryone deserves a transparent understanding of what happened here. I am fully supportive of County Executive Charlie Dooley and St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar calling for DOJ and the FBI to take a careful, open review of the events that led to this tragedy for everyone involved.\u201d Blunt defended local law enforcement\u2019s subsequent actions on Wednesday, saying that \u201cthe people around the country that I talk to, the Chief of Police in St. Louis County, John Belmar, is at the top of the list in terms of expertise and his preparation,\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m just really in no position to analyze, not having been there, what the police did or why they did it after the event but I do know they\u2019ve had several days of trouble they\u2019ve had to try to deal with in the best possible way.\u201d\n\nSen. Claire McCaskill (D): On Monday, McCaskill released a statement saying, \u201cAs a mother, I grieve for this child and his family. I pray that the wonderful, hardworking, and God-loving people of Ferguson will find peace and patience as we wait for the results of what will be numerous and thorough investigations of what happened. I, like so many other Missourians, will not be satisfied until we have a complete and transparent understanding of all the facts and circumstances that led to this young man\u2019s death.\u201d Wednesday, following a call with the Acting Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights at the U.S. Department of Justice, she said \u201cAs we continue to grieve for Michael and his family, I\u2019m working to make sure the federal piece of this investigation is fair, transparent, and moving forward without delay. As it proceeds, I\u2019ll be remaining in close touch with the Department of Justice, and am reaching out personally to local elected officials and religious leaders, to keep monitoring the painful events on the ground in Ferguson.\u201d\n\nRep. William Lacy Clay Jr. (D): Clay, whose 1st District includes Ferguson, joined with Reps. John Conyers (D-MI) and Marcia Fudge (D-OH) on Monday to request that the Department of Justice not only investigate the \u201cthe facts of the specific incident\u201d of Brown\u2019s shooting but also \u201cthe potential for any pattern or practice of police misconduct by the Ferguson Police Department.\u201d They argueed that \u201cthe St. Louis County Police Department may not be the most objective or credible body to investigate civil rights matters involving law enforcement given evidence of racial profiling by that department in the recent past.\u201d\n\nRep. Ann Wagner (R): Wagner, whose 2nd District neighbors Clay\u2019s district in the western St. Louis suburbs, put out a statement on Monday saying, \u201cAs a mother of three children, I cannot even imagine the pain of losing a child.
