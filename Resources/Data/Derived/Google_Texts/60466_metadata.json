While they may surprise America with some never-before-heard attacks, new misinformed arguments or gross generalizations, it\u2019s not hard to predict most of their likely talking points based on what they\u2019ve said during their campaigns so far. A not-insignificant number of them have already been debunked, but that won\u2019t stop them from being repeated. (If they repeat them often enough, maybe they\u2019ll start to believe them.)\n\nHere are 11 lies you\u2019ll likely hear the candidates say at some point during the debate:\n\n\u201c[Obamacare] has failed to accomplish its prime objective: Containing health care costs.\u201d\n\nIn the wake of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision this June leaving the Affordable Care Act intact, every Republican candidate issued a response denouncing the decision and criticizing Obama\u2019s signature health care law. Jindal\u2019s response cut right to the most prevalent misconception about the legislation \u2014 that it has caused healthcare costs to skyrocket. Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush similarly declared that the flawed law \u201cimposes job-killing mandates, causes spending in Washington to skyrocket by $1.7 trillion, raises taxes by $1 trillion and drives up health care costs.\u201d\n\nIn reality, Obamacare is spurring job-creating start-ups, dropping the uninsurance rate to historic lows, and states that accepted the law\u2019s Medicaid expansion are creating even more jobs. The Congressional Budget Office recently found that the law will cost the federal government $1.2 trillion over the next decade, 11 percent less than the agency estimated earlier in the year. Most of the tax increases have affected those making more than $200,000. And costs have increased modestly this year, but well below the double-digit hikes that many feared. The candidates likely won\u2019t admit it on Thursday but Obamacare has proven to be a success.\n\n\u201cWe need a president who will finally act to secure the border after decades of failed leadership in Washington, D.C.\u201d\n\nFormer Texas Gov. Rick Perry said this during an attack on Donald Trump last month, but most of the Republicans have said they would prioritize securing the border when they reach the White House. Trump has said that \u201cthere\u2019s a huge problem with illegals coming through\u201d the U.S.-Mexico border and Bush\u2019s immigration plan, like those of his competitors, emphasizes border security. Many candidates have also warned of terrorists getting in the U.S. through the \u201cporous\u201d borders.\n\nIt\u2019s easy for the candidates to point the finger at Obama for letting millions of undocumented immigrants into the country, but the U.S. has more resources deployed than ever before on the border and illegal crossings have dropped dramatically. Border crossings are at a 40-year low with undocumented migration at or below zero. In 2013, there were more \u201cboots on the ground\u201d at the border than there have ever been in history.\n\n\u201cPlanned Parenthood is possibly selling the body parts of the babies it has aborted.\u201d\n\nAn organization that works to discredit Planned Parenthood recently released heavily edited videos claiming the women\u2019s health group is \u201cselling aborted baby parts.\u201d In the days following the first video\u2019s release, many of the anti-choice Republican candidates denounced Planned Parenthood\u2019s actions and both Texas Sen. Ted Cruz \u2014 who said the above remark in a statement \u2014 and Jindal called for investigations.\n\nBut the findings from the sting operation video don\u2019t hold up. Planned Parenthood is open about its involvement in tissue donation, but emphasizes it is not actually selling anything or benefiting financially. In the unedited video footage, the Planned Parenthood representative says directly, \u201cNobody should be \u2018selling\u2019 tissue. That\u2019s just not the goal here.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe satellite data demonstrate that there has been no significant warming whatsoever for 17 years.\u201d\n\nThe GOP candidates range from those who call climate change a hoax to those who will acknowledge a small degree of human involvement in the warming of the plant. Cruz, who has said a variation of this statement multiple times including at the Koch brothers\u2019 summit this weekend, is the worst in terms of climate change denial. Former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum, Trump, and Walker follow closely behind.\n\nNeedless to say, the data show that the planet is warming and will continue to do so, especially if the next president doesn\u2019t expand on Obama\u2019s climate agenda. Ninety-seven percent of climate scientists agree that climate-warming trends over the past century are very likely due to human activities.\n\n\u201cOur biggest threat [in this country] is radical Islamic terrorism.\u201d\n\nWisconsin Gov. Scott Walker said this tough-on-terrorism line to a group of GOP activists in New Hampshire earlier this year, but the remark could just as likely come out of many of the contenders\u2019 mouths. The GOP candidates have been quick to criticize President Obama\u2019s decision not to call ISIS \u201cIslamic extremists.\u201d Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal appeared on Fox News last month to reiterate the same point. \u201cThis President seems to bend over backwards to want to avoid saying that, he won\u2019t even say the words \u2018radical Islamic terrorism,\u2019\u201d Jindal said.\n\nThe Republican candidates are quick to denounce Islamic terrorism after mass shootings like the recent shooting in Chattanooga, Tennessee that killed five Marines. But they will not speak out about radical, right-wing Americans who actually pose a greater terrorist threat to the country. Recent studies have shown that domestic attacks by right-wing radicals are a graver concern to law enforcement and have led to more deaths than the threat of \u201chomegrown jihadists.\u201d\n\n\u201cObama\u2019s plan should be called the Costly Power Plan because it will cost hard-working Americans jobs and raise their energy rates.\u201d\n\nThe candidates will likely bash Obama\u2019s Clean Power Plan, which the administration released this week. Walker was the only candidate to say the plan should be called the \u201cCostly Power Plan,\u201d but Cruz called it \u201clawless and radical\u201d and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio warned that the plan will raise the cost of electricity for millions of Americans. \u201cSo if there\u2019s some billionaire somewhere who is a pro-environmental, cap and trade person, yeah, they can probably afford for their electric bill to go up a couple of hundred dollars,\u201d Rubio said Sunday. \u201dBut if you\u2019re a single mom in Tampa, Florida, and your electric bill goes up by $30 a month, that is catastrophic.\u201d\n\nScientists have said the plan is necessary to stave off climate catastrophe and research shows that it will actually lower people\u2019s energy costs. A study found that energy bills in 2030 could be $35 per month lower under a \u201cClean Energy Future\u201d scenario as compared to business-as-usual. The collateral benefits of the plan include lower electricity bills, greater GDP growth, and significant reductions in SO2, NOx, and mercury emissions.\n\n\u201c[Common Core is] a scheme to drive education curriculum from Washington, D.C.\u201d\n\nThe candidates are more mixed about their feelings toward the Common Core education standards, but those who oppose them, like Jindal, are vocal about the need to return control to the states. Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee has called for killing the standards and restoring \u201ccommon sense\u201d while Cruz has said \u201cwe need to repeal every word of Common Core,\u201d despite the fact that there is no federal law to repeal.\n\nCommon Core was developed by the states with input from teachers, education experts and business leaders and has been voluntarily adopted by 43 states and the District of Columbia. The standards have become deeply controversial even though they have not changed since they were first released. At the time, both Republicans and Democrats heralded the standards as one of the most promising school reforms in decades.\n\n\u201cThis is not a good deal, but a recipe for disaster and the first fateful step toward a frenzied nuclear arms race in the Middle East.\u201d\n\nFormer neurosurgeon Ben Carson is one of many Republican contenders to speak out against Obama\u2019s Iran deal. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie similarly said that \u201cthe president is playing a dangerous game with our national security, and the deal as structured will lead to a nuclear Iran and, then, a nuclearized Middle East.\u201d\n\nThe Iranian nuclear deal struck last month was greeted internationally with much acclaim, but politicians\u2019 predictions about how the deal will play out are all speculation. The GOP candidates are repeating Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu when saying the deal will lead to an arms race in the Middle East, but many international experts have said it will actually slow development of nuclear arms in the Middle East and support the deal, including former Israeli security heads.\n\n\u201cInstead of a safety net to cushion our occasional falls, they have built a spider web that traps people in perpetual dependence.\u201d\n\nThough Bush speaking in Detroit in February might be the only candidate to word it in this particular way, many 2016 candidates believe that welfare breeds a culture of dependence in the United States. Carson similarly has said that he\u2019s \u201cnot interested in getting rid of the safety net\u201d but he is \u201cinterested in getting rid of dependency.\u201d He has even gone so far to say that Obama is purposefully depressing the economy to keep people on welfare.\n\nRepublicans love to discuss welfare dependency, but in reality, Americans who rely on programs like food stamps are extremely likely to go back to work and no longer need the safety net. A 2013 study found that 87 percent of households receiving money from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program in a given month include an individual who worked in the prior year or will work in the following year.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s sad to see the Democrats take a horrific crime and try to use it as an excuse, not to go after people with serious mental illness or people who are repeat felons or criminals, but instead try to use it as an excuse to take away Second Amendment rights of law abiding citizens.\u201d\n\nAll of the GOP candidates are staunch Second Amendment supports and love to accuse Democrats of trying to take away their guns after episodes of violence. After the shooting in Charleston, South Carolina of nine African American church members, Cruz made this remark while campaigning in Iowa. Perry has also said that \u201cthe left\u2019s move is always to say, \u2018Well, let\u2019s just take the guns away.\u2019\u201d\n\nWhen Democrats push for gun control measures after mass shootings, they are fighting for background checks, closing gun show loopholes and other moderate measures that would not affect \u201claw abiding citizens.\u201d Our lax gun laws are the main reason why the firearm homicide rate in the U.S. in nearly 20 times as high as that of the average high-income country. And the evidence proves that simple reforms would prevent violence \u2014 when Missouri repealed its law requiring permits to purchase handguns, the murder rate in the state increased by 16 percent.\n\n\u201cInstead of fighting over the minimum wage, why don\u2019t we focus on solutions that help every American earn his or her maximum wage.\u201d\n\nHuckabee, like many Republicans, isn\u2019t a fan of raising the minimum wage. In many public appearances and interviews, he has said that instead, we should aim for Americans to reach their \u201cmaximum wage.\u201d Bush and Christie have said we need to leave the minimum wage to the private sector and Walker has said his state minimum wage doesn\u2019t \u201cserve a purpose.\u201d\n\nRaising the federal minimum wage would actually help a large number of Americans and would have the greatest impact on working women. Boosting wages would also help the economy overall because it would reduce turnover and cut the costs that employers that pay low wages impose on taxpayers. And studies show that raising the minimum wage does not result in job losses, despite what many Republican candidates claim.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "How closely will the candidates follow their own scripts?", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "How closely will the candidates follow their own scripts?", "title": "11 Things You\u2019ll Probably Hear During The First GOP Debate That Are Totally False", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/politics/2015/08/04/3687520/first-republican-debate/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/03171955/GOPDEBATEDIT.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "How closely will the candidates follow their own scripts?", "creator": "@Kira_Lerner", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/03171955/GOPDEBATEDIT-321x214.jpg", "title": "11 Things You\u2019ll Probably Hear During The First GOP Debate That Are Totally False", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-politics", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/03171955/GOPDEBATEDIT.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/03171955/GOPDEBATEDIT.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2015-08-04T09:57:22+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/KiraLerner"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce4c2\"", "article_summary": "The candidates likely won\u2019t admit it on Thursday but Obamacare has proven to be a success.\nThe Republican candidates are quick to denounce Islamic terrorism after mass shootings like the recent shooting in Chattanooga, Tennessee that killed five Marines.\nAnd studies show that raising the minimum wage does not result in job losses, despite what many Republican candidates claim.\nJindal\u2019s response cut right to the most prevalent misconception about the legislation \u2014 that it has caused healthcare costs to skyrocket.\nThe GOP candidates have been quick to criticize President Obama\u2019s decision not to call ISIS \u201cIslamic extremists.\u201d Louisiana Gov."}
