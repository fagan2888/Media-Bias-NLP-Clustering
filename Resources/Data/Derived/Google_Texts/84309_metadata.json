Nearly two years ago, Oliver Dehning, the chief executive of security software maker antispameuropeGmbH called the National Security Agency spying revelations a \u201cpresent from heaven,\u201d adding that it\u2019s \u201can opportunity to strike back and protect our home market.\u201d\n\n\u201cData protection has always been a sensitive topic, but it is even more so following Edward Snowden\u2019s monitoring revelations,\u201d said Steve Phillips, CIO of Avnet, an electronics distributor with $28 billion in revenue last year. Avnet hasn\u2019t had to move data to comply with local regulations but Mr. Phillips is watching debate in Europe about whether to require companies to store European data there. Approximately 30% of Avnet\u2019s sales are from Europe. \u201cWe\u2019re monitoring that dialog closely,\u201d he said.\n\nThe issue is likely to influence the 2016 presidential race as candidates seeking donations face questions from U.S. executives about surveillance and trade policy, Mr. Castro said. Already for U.S. companies, cloud computing build-outs have become \u201cmore decentralized,\u201d than they otherwise would have been, adding to operations costs. Amazon, for example, is building new facilities in Frankfurt and Microsoft is building new facilities in Vienna, said Jon Atkin a managing director with RBC Capital Markets, LLC.\n\nMichael Overly, a partner with the law firm Foley & Lardner LLP, said he has represented cloud providers that have been required to establish a presence in other countries because of concerns about spying. \u201cAs the Snowden documents have shown, the U.S. government has a long arm when it comes to data monitoring and collection,\u201d Mr. Overly said.\n\nConsumer electronics maker Belkin International Inc. recently worked with Salesforce.com Inc. to move Belkin\u2019s customer data from servers in various locales to Russia, to comply with a new Russian law that requires that data about its citizens be stored locally.\n\nLast month, cloud vendor Rackspace lowered revenue expectations for its current quarter, in part because a major African customer was relocating its data from Rackspace\u2019s U.K. data centers due to data sovereignty laws.\n\nMicrosoft and Amazon couldn\u2019t immediately be reached for comment on this story.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "The U.S. government's widespread data surveillance practices are likely to cost U.S. cloud computing and other tech firms more money in lost sales and other expenses than originally expected, says one technology industry-funded think tank.", "title": "U.S. Surveillance Backlash Could Cost Tech Companies More Than $35 Billion by 2016", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/cio/2015/06/09/u-s-surveillance-backlash-could-cost-tech-companies-more-than-35-billion-by-2016/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-IV596_0609_c_E_20150609164730.jpg"}, "site": "WSJ", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "CSuite", "article.headline": "U.S. Surveillance Backlash Could Cost Tech Companies More Than $35 Billion by 2016", "description": "The U.S. government's widespread data surveillance practices are likely to cost U.S. cloud computing and other tech firms more money in lost sales and other expenses than originally expected, says one technology industry-funded think tank.", "article_section": "CSuite", "author": "Robert McMillan and Kim S.
