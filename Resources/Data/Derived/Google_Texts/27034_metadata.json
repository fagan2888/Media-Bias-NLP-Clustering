She says it\u2019s not fair to prevent caregivers from making some money on surplus medical marijuana. Besides, she says, patients need it.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s not a marijuana fairy going to fly around and gift the patients with medical marijuana,\u201d says Schneider.\n\nSchneider says patients are \"literally dying\" waiting for state lawmakers to make safe medical marijuana more accessible.\n\nIf the state Senate doesn\u2019t act on the legislation this week, it dies.\n\nIf the bills are approved, they will head to the governor\u2019s desk.\n\nA spokesman for Gov. Rick Snyder declined to comment on the medical marijuana bills, except to say \u201cThe governor\u2019s practice is to thoroughly review bills once they\u2019ve been presented to him before determining whether the bills should be signed into law.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"category": "Law", "description": "The state Senate may vote in the next day or so on major changes to Michigan\u2019s medical marijuana law.
