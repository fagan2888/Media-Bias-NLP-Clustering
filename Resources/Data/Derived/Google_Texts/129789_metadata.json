For the past year, Blandon has acted as both patient and teacher for Barger, a third-year medical student who accompanied her during prenatal appointments.\n\nIt\u2019s been valuable for both.\n\n\u201cShe said that whenever she has something she needs ... I\u2019m able to give her either the answer or what she needs at the clinic,\u201d said Barger, acting as Blandon\u2019s translator.\n\nThe uninsured Camden resident has received free medical care and lots of attention, thanks to a year-round clinic at 3 Cooper Plaza run by students from Cooper Medical School of Rowan University and the Philadelphia College of Pharmacy, University of the Sciences.\n\nWith 268 students who see patients weekly and just 250 patients in its files, the clinic is experiencing an embarrassment of riches when it comes to medical providers.\n\nEven so, there is a need for the clinic\u2019s services in the city.\n\nWhile the Affordable Care Act and New Jersey\u2019s participation in expanded Medicaid increased the number of people with coverage, Camden still has plenty of uninsured residents who need primary care, explained Dr. Anna Headly, a Cooper assistant professor who oversees the clinic.\n\n\u201cCooper is a safety-net hospital, but even safety nets can\u2019t catch everyone,\u201d Headly said. \u201cThat\u2019s why it\u2019s good that we\u2019re here.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of people who are not eligible \u2014 mainly (the) undocumented. They\u2019ve been here a long time. Many of them speak English ... but they\u2019ve never been able to get papers.\u201d\n\nOthers could not afford even subsidized premiums through the federal insurance marketplace or were stuck waiting for their Medicaid applications to be approved. Most of the clinic\u2019s patients are the working poor.\n\nAt the clinic, patients are matched with students who follow every aspect of their care, from the initial exam to making appointments, handing out medications, and faxing required paperwork for things such as insulin. Appointments can last from 30 to 90 minutes.\n\nTypical health issues include diabetes, high blood pressure, depression and other effects of stress and trauma. But the students also have diagnosed a few patients with terminal cancer, accompanying them through hospice care. One medical student was invited to a funeral.\n\nBut much of their clinic work involves asking questions and listening to patients, explained Christopher Smith, a second-year student at Cooper Medical School. Students aren\u2019t expected to know all the answers, but they work with faculty to find them out. In the meantime, they practice empathy as they help patients navigate the complexities of the health care system.\n\nMatched last year with a patient with uncontrolled asthma, Smith learned the man often ended up in a hospital emergency department because he didn\u2019t have medication or primary care. Smith offered him both, along with his cellphone in case he needed help between appointments.\n\n\u201cI believe it\u2019s going to help the future of medicine,\u201d said Smith, a 34-year-old who moved his young family to Camden. \u201cYou become a care provider, but you also become an advocate.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is a learning environment. We\u2019re in this together.\u201d\n\nReach Kim Mulford at (856) 486-2448 or kmulford@courierpostonline.com.
