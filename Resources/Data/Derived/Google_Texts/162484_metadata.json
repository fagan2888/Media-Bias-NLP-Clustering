For beverages, manufacturers also must provide a one-dose measuring cup with the product.\n\nDixie has spend several hundred thousand dollars developing a package that has the measuring cup integrated into the child-resistant lid, said Joe Hodas, Dixie\u2019s chief marketing officer.\n\n\u201cThere are some solutions that would have worked for a non-carbonated beverage, so we went about the process of inventing on,\u201d Hodas said. \u201cThey do not make a resealable child-resistant bottle that holds carbonation.\u201d\n\nThe company also has developed Dixie Lift, a single-serving one-ounce drink the size of an energy beverage.\n\nUnder Colorado law, child-resistant is defined as packaging that is designed or constructed to be significantly difficult for children younger than five to open and not difficult for normal adults to use properly. The law also requires packaging to be opaque so that the product cannot be seen without opening it. The packaging also must be resealable for any product intended for more than a single use or containing multiple servings.\n\nThe state has officially set the serving size of active THC in each edible marijuana product at ten milligrams. It also has set the maximum serving size of an individual marijuana product at 100 milligrams of THC. The rules also require edibles to be capable of being easily separated into a delineation that matches the serving size amount. For instance, if a chocolate bar contains ten serving sizes in a single product, it mast have indents that allow it to be easily broken into ten pieces.", "article_metadata": {"layout": "main", "description": "Dixie Elixirs has spent several hundred thousand dollars developing new packaging for its signature sodas.", "author": "Margaret Jackson", "og": {"site_name": "MainStreet", "description": "Dixie Elixirs has spent several hundred thousand dollars developing new packaging for its signature sodas.", "title": "Marijuana Edibles Companies Face Challenge of Child-Proofing Product", "url": "https://www.mainstreet.com/article/marijuana-edibles-companies-face-challenge-of-child-proofing-product", "image": {"width": 600, "secure_url": "https://s.mainstreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/1-marijuanabundles-mslarge.jpg", "identifier": "https://s.mainstreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/1-marijuanabundles-mslarge.jpg", "height": 400}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "section": "Insurance", "keywords": "personal finance, marijuana, edibles, child-proofing, stink sack, personal finance, marijuana patch", "fb": {"app_id": 925400040808836}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/MainStreet", "section": "Insurance", "tag": "marijuana patch", "published_time": "2015-02-26T10:23Z", "author": "https://www.mainstreet.com/author/1625724"}, "date": "2015-02-26T10:23Z", "contentType": "article", "guid": 13059126, "twitter": {"description": "Dixie Elixirs has spent several hundred thousand dollars developing new packaging for its signature sodas.", "title": "Marijuana Edibles Companies Face Challenge of Child-Proofing Product", "url": "https://www.mainstreet.com/article/marijuana-edibles-companies-face-challenge-of-child-proofing-product", "image": {"src": "https://s.mainstreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/1-marijuanabundles-mslarge.jpg", "identifier": "https://s.mainstreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/1-marijuanabundles-mslarge.jpg"}, "site": "@mainstr", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "personal finance, marijuana, edibles, child-proofing, stink sack, personal finance, marijuana patch"}, "article_summary": "ADVERTISEMENTDENVER (MainStreet) \u2014 When new regulations for packaging edibles went into effect this month, infused-product manufacturer Dixie Elixirs pulled its signature sodas out of dispensaries.\nThe state has officially set the serving size of active THC in each edible marijuana product at ten milligrams.\nThe rules also require edibles to be capable of being easily separated into a delineation that matches the serving size amount.\nIt also has set the maximum serving size of an individual marijuana product at 100 milligrams of THC.\nFor instance, if a chocolate bar contains ten serving sizes in a single product, it mast have indents that allow it to be easily broken into ten pieces."}
