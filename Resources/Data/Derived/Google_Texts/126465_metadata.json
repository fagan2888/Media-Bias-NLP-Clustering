Matching hysterectomies and mastectomies, however, was never the part of the plan.\n\n\u201cWe have to remind ourselves every day why we are doing this,\u201d Hannah said. \u201cIt\u2019s not a walk in the park. There is a lot of grief that is involved.\u201d\n\nThe 39-year-old twins used some bad news to change the course of their futures. Their grandmother died years ago of pancreatic cancer and their mother, Jayne Robertson, is currently undergoing chemotherapy during her fourth battle with ovarian cancer.\n\n\u201cIt is exhausting,\u201d said Robertson, who still lives in Greene County. \u201cThe fatigue is just astronomical. The fatigue never goes away.\u201d\n\nAfter watching Robertson\u2019s struggle, her three daughters opted for genetic counseling, and ultimately, genetic testing through the My Risk test from Myriad Genetics.\n\nMore and more people are searching for clues to their health through their own DNA, a trend that accelerated after actress Angelina Jolie told the public in 2013 that she\u2019d tested positive for BRCA, a gene associated with an increased risk of breast and ovarian cancers. Jolie subsequently had a double mastectomy.\n\nMedical experts say such preventative measures are a personal decision that is not for everyone. It can make people anxious or depressed and give them a false sense of security. But it can also greatly reduce the chances of contracting debilitating or deadly cancers, and improve quality of life, according to health care professionals.\n\nRobertson\u2019s youngest daughter learned she does not carry any worrisome genes, but Hannah and McWilliams both carry the BRCA 2 gene. They were told they have an 87 percent likelihood of developing breast cancer in their lifetime and are nearly as likely to develop ovarian cancer. Their cousin, Sherry, received the same results.\n\n\u201cWe said, \u2018Why not preserve life and do what we can to prevent what my mom has gone through?\u2019 \u201d Hannah said. \u201cI knew that in the long run, if I got cancer I wasn\u2019t going to forgive myself. I would not have been able to move forward, so I\u2019m doing everything I can to prevent it early on.\u201d\n\nThe twins and their cousin \u2014 all wives and mothers \u2014 opted for prophylactic hysterectomies. Williamson has already had her surgery and the other two women will go forward with the same procedure soon. They are staggering their surgeries to better care for one another.\n\nMcWilliams said the process has been positive for her family.\n\n\u201cMy (two) boys are watching this, you know. What better way \u2014 not to say that I wish this on anybody \u2014 but what better way to teach them that family takes care of family?\u201d she said.\n\nThe twins\u2019 doctor is Caroline Peterson, Kettering Health Network\u2019s director of Breast Screening & Early Detection. She says genetic testing is more affordable and comprehensive now. Doctors can screen for 25 different genes for breast, ovarian, colon, uterine, pancreatic, prostate cancer and even melanoma.\n\nThe retail cost of the test is approximately $3,500, but with changes from the Affordable Care Act that started on Jan. 1, Peterson says 92 percent of her patients pay nothing out of pocket.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re trying to do is identify those patients who are as high as 87 percent or even just greater than 20 percent,\u201d Peterson said.\n\nPatients who test negative have no guarantees they won\u2019t develop sporadic cancer. For example, Peterson said the average woman has an 11 percent chance of developing breast cancer over her lifetime, and 80 percent of women who get breast cancer develop it sporadically, meaning they don\u2019t carry the gene. The majority are in their 60s or 70s.\n\nProphylactic surgeries like mastectomies and hysterectomies reduce the cancer risk \u201cto almost zero,\u201d Peterson said.\n\nHannah and McWilliams get choked up talking about their mother\u2019s struggle with cancer.\n\n\u201dShe\u2019s the glue to our family,\u201d Hannah said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Growing up in Beavercreek, Angela Hannah and Katrina McWilliams shared a lot \u2014 outfits, hairstyles, even photographs in their wedding dresses.", "og": {"url": "http://www.daytondailynews.com/news/lifestyles/health/searching-for-cancer-markers-through-dna/nn5p7/", "image": "http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/img/photos/2015/10/19/de/88/beavercreek-twins.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Growing up in Beavercreek, Angela Hannah and Katrina McWilliams shared a lot \u2014 outfits, hairstyles, even photographs in their wedding dresses.", "title": "Beavercreek twins opt for surgeries to reduce breast cancer risk"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/lt/lt_cache/resize/120x120/img/photos/2015/10/19/de/88/beavercreek-twins.jpg", "description": "Growing up in Beavercreek, Angela Hannah and Katrina McWilliams shared a lot \u2014 outfits, hairstyles, even photographs in their wedding dresses.", "site": "@daytondailynews", "card": "summary", "title": "Searching for cancer markers through DNA"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "ddn", "vr": {"canonical": "http://www.daytondailynews.com/news/lifestyles/health/searching-for-cancer-markers-through-dna/nn5p7/"}, "cmg_revpath": "/re/292/3105099/news/lifestyles/health/searching-for-cancer-markers-through-dna/nn5p7/", "keywords": "Breast cancer", "google-site-verification": "fR8PW_DfizdYW0uymF5VkAzfbNKqKxqfnhqsbXSP7oI", "news_keywords": "Breast cancer"}, "article_summary": "They were told they have an 87 percent likelihood of developing breast cancer in their lifetime and are nearly as likely to develop ovarian cancer.\nProphylactic surgeries like mastectomies and hysterectomies reduce the cancer risk \u201cto almost zero,\u201d Peterson said.\nTheir grandmother died years ago of pancreatic cancer and their mother, Jayne Robertson, is currently undergoing chemotherapy during her fourth battle with ovarian cancer.\nFor example, Peterson said the average woman has an 11 percent chance of developing breast cancer over her lifetime, and 80 percent of women who get breast cancer develop it sporadically, meaning they don\u2019t carry the gene.\nDoctors can screen for 25 different genes for breast, ovarian, colon, uterine, pancreatic, prostate cancer and even melanoma."}
