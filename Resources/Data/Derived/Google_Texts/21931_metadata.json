How much is it going to cost? All these questions are abounding right now because the details are very few,\u201d said Jonathan Ryan, Executive Director of Refugee and Immigrant Center for Education and Legal Services.\n\nRyan worked with Spanish-language TV stations in San Antonio for three days of telethons starting immediately on the evening of the president\u2019s Nov. 20 speech. Since then, he has added community workshops. RAICES estimated its attorneys have spoken with 3,000 undocumented residents so far.\n\n\u201cWhat we do more than anything is we just clarify what the president announced,\" Ryan said. \"At this point, nobody can give specific immigration advice to anybody about whether they\u2019re eligible because we don\u2019t have the specific instructions, the specific points of eligibility. We just know the broad strokes at this point and the government has three to six months during which it\u2019s going to fill in the detail.\u201d\n\nCatholic Television of San Antonio is starting a monthly call-in program in January, underwritten in part by the Texas Bar Foundation. CTSA\u2019s J. Antonio Fernandez said many residents just want someone they can trust.\n\n\u201cSome of their questions are, \u2018How do I get a VISA to work? Can I go back to Mexico if I am here working legally? Do I have to pay taxes?\u2019 So things like that - very simple questions. But I think sometimes people are afraid to go to lawyers or they feel like coming to Catholic Charities because they think we are the church, they feel safe here, that\u2019s no one is going to deport them,\u201d Fernandez said.\n\nLaw schools are helping too. Adriane Meneses is the supervising attorney of the Immigration Human Rights Clinic at St. Mary\u2019s University, which is advising clients on paperwork they\u2019ll need to document five years of residence \u2013 and that includes tax returns. Meneses said contrary to the popular rhetoric that says undocumented immigrants don\u2019t pull their weight, most of them are paying income tax.\n\n\u201cThere are millions of people that dutifully pay their income taxes every year with I-TIN numbers,\" Meneses said. \"In fact \u2013 and I\u2019ve seen multiple hundreds of people\u2019s paperwork \u2013 I would say that the majority of our DACA applicants here in San Antonio bring in, as part of the evidence that they\u2019ve been here for the required amount of time, bring in the tax returns on which they are listed \u2013 usually the parents\u2019 tax returns or for the older applicants, their own tax returns. In fact, it\u2019s somewhat unusual when we come across an applicant who doesn\u2019t have an I-TIN.\u201d\n\nRAICES spokesman Mohammed Abdollahi said undocumented residents are not usually discovered and deported as a result of having a relationship with the Internal Revenue Service.\n\n\u201cIn the past what we\u2019ve told folks for deferred action and those cases, the IRS doesn\u2019t care about your legal status. They just want to make sure they get their tax money.\u201d\n\nA 2010 Social Security Administration report, \"Effects of the Unauthorized immigration on the Actuarial Status of the Social Security Trust Funds,\" stated that earnings by unauthorized immigrants resulted in a net positive effect on Social Security financial status and contributed roughly $12 billion to the cash flow of the program for 2010.\n\nAccording to the most recent information from the White House, immigrants protected under the executive order will become eligible for Social Security after ten years of contributions \u2013 but the money already paid into the system under phony social security numbers will not be returned to them.\n\nThey will not be eligible for other federal benefits such as welfare, food stamps, Medicaid, or benefits under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nRyan tells applicants coming to RAICES that they have a lot of work ahead of them in the next several months to get their paperwork together.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re going to have to go to their consulates, potentially, to seek passports or national IDs. People are going to have to start proving their physical presence, because in both groups \u2013 DACA (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals) and DAPA (Deferred Action for Parental Accountability) \u2013 they must have been physically present in this country since January 1, 2010.\u201d\n\nIn the meantime, they have to watch out for fraud \u2013 people who would promise them a quick application process \u2013 or who promise to remove a DWI or other offense that would disqualify them.\n\nCurrent estimates are that more than 4.5 million people may be eligible for protection from deportation.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Border & Immigration", "description": "Immigrants hoping for deferred deportation status have another two to six months before applications will become available for President Obama\u2019s", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://tpr.org/post/those-who-would-apply-daca-and-dapa-status-face-months-paperwork-ahead", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/kstx/files/styles/medium/public/201412/Eloisa_Mata%2C_left%2C_and_Maria_Calixto%2C_right%2C_work_on_DACA_cases.JPG", "type": "article", "description": "Immigrants hoping for deferred deportation status have another two to six months before applications will become available for President Obama\u2019s", "title": "Those Who Would Apply for DACA and DAPA Status  Face Months of Paperwork Ahead"}, "story_id": 368757764, "twitter": {"site": "@TPRNews", "card": "summary", "creator": "@TPRNews"}, "author": "Eileen Pace", "org_id": 0, "dc": {"title": "Those Who Would Apply for DACA and DAPA Status  Face Months of Paperwork Ahead"}, "nid": 42362, "datePublished": "2014-12-05", "wordCount": 1074, "has_audio": 1, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcab87\"", "article_summary": "\"In fact \u2013 and I\u2019ve seen multiple hundreds of people\u2019s paperwork \u2013 I would say that the majority of our DACA applicants here in San Antonio bring in, as part of the evidence that they\u2019ve been here for the required amount of time, bring in the tax returns on which they are listed \u2013 usually the parents\u2019 tax returns or for the older applicants, their own tax returns.\nImmigrants hoping for deferred deportation status have another two to six months before applications will become available for President Obama\u2019s Immigration Accountability Executive Actions program.\nRyan tells applicants coming to RAICES that they have a lot of work ahead of them in the next several months to get their paperwork together.\n\u201cIn the past what we\u2019ve told folks for deferred action and those cases, the IRS doesn\u2019t care about your legal status.\nAttorneys and refugee organizations in Texas have been working non-stop to answer the tide of questions arising from the president\u2019s speech."}
