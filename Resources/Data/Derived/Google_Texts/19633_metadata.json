Henson, who plays matriarch Cookie Lyon in \u201cEmpire,\u201d will \u201cadd a line or word that makes it sparkle,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe Affair\u201d producer Sarah Treem agreed with his assessment. Treem, a playwright whose other TV credits include \u201cHouse of Cards,\u201d produces Showtime\u2019s drama series with a cast that includes American actors Maura Tierney and Joshua Jackson and, from England, Dominic West and Ruth Wilson.\n\n\u201cBritish actors really like the text. \u2026 They practice the text, and they\u2019re perfect on the text,\u201d she said. In contrast, Tierney is a \u201cgenius\u201d at improvising, Treem said. That\u2019s prompted the script supervisor to ask if the actress should be told to refrain.\n\n\u201d \u2018No, let the woman speak,\u2019 \u201d is Treem\u2019s reply. \u201cShe\u2019ll come up with something that is honestly more instinctive and more natural than what\u2019s on the page,\u201d the writer added.\n\nShe noted another national difference, this involving America and France. Treem said that \u201chate mail\u201d was posted online after she gave a U.S. interview in which she questioned whether monogamy can hold in a long-term relationship.\n\n\u201cI was on the phone talking with somebody from France about the show and they had this totally different perspective. It\u2019s great talking to the French,\u201d Treem said.\n\nIn the event that included producers from CBS\u2019 \u201cThe Good Wife,\u201d FX\u2019s \u201cFargo\u201d and Amazon Studios\u2019 \u201cTransparent,\u201d the panelists were asked about a dream writing project they have yet to pursue.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t been afraid since \u2018Rosemary\u2019s Baby\u2019 or \u2018The Exorcist,\u2019 Daniels said. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t think there\u2019s been an African-American horror movie that\u2019s really got me to the bones. I think I\u2019d like to tackle that.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Producers spill on Yanks vs. Brits \u2014 who ad-libs best", "title": "Producers spill on Yanks vs. Brits \u2014 who ad-libs best", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/04/09/producers-spill-on-yanks-vs-brits-who-ad-libs-best/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150409__20150412_E2_AE12TVSCRIPTp1.jpg", "height": 436}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150409__20150412_E2_AE12TVSCRIPTp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-04-09T17:58:17+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-25T12:27:15+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca81c\"", "article_summary": "\u201cI said, \u2018You don\u2019t have to say the word.\u2019 \u2026 And he was like, \u2018No, this is the word,\u2019 \u201d Daniels said.\n\u201cAnd I don\u2019t think there\u2019s been an African-American horror movie that\u2019s really got me to the bones.\nDuring production of the 2013 film \u201cLee Daniels\u2019 The Butler,\u201d veteran British actor Alan Rickman, playing President Ronald Reagan, \u201cwas married to the word,\u201d Daniels said.\nLOS ANGELES \u2014 American actors don\u2019t always stick to the scripts the way their U.K. counterparts do, but that\u2019s OK, according to two top writer-producers.\n\u201cBritish actors really like the text."}
