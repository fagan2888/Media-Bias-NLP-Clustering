A patient is believed to have walked away from a Pueblo mental health facility Friday night.

The Colorado Mental Health Institute at Pueblo (CMHIP) says Billy Ray Raines was last seen at Golden Gate Manor on 606 W. Abriendo Ave. around 8 p.m., but could not be found during the 9 p.m. and 11 p.m. checks. Golden Gate Manor is one of the facilities that CMHIP says it places its patients in.

Raines was committed to CMHIP in 1990, following convictions for second-degree burglary, conspiracy and criminal mischief.

Raines,55, is identified as 5-foot-7 Hispanic man. He has black hair with some gray/silver, brown eyes and weights about 140-150 pounds. He was last seen wearing a blue and gray v-neck shirt with cut off sleeves, jeans and silverish-white tennis shoes with red accents.

CMHIP says that as with all their patients, there is a potential for Raines to be a threat to public safety if he's not in a controlled environment where he is taking medications.

Contact authorities right away if you know where he is.
