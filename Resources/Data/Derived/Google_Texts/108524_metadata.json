(SAUL LOEB/AFP/Getty Images)\n\n4440846\n\nThe decisive midterm election results have done little to affect President Obama\u2019s determination to continue to expand government. As Mr. Obama nears the end of his presidency, he continues to promise \u201ca new future\u201d of even more big-government initiatives.\n\n\u201cMy presidency is entering the fourth quarter,\u201d said Mr. Obama, \u201cinteresting stuff happens in the fourth quarter.\u201d For those who believe the Obama administration has already given the country more than enough \u201cinteresting stuff,\u201d the only thing standing between the American people and Mr. Obama\u2019s vision of a new future is our recently seated 114th Congress.\n\nMr. Obama refuses to acknowledge the vote of no confidence that his administration received in the midterm elections. \u201cI\u2019m going to play offense,\u201d he said as he recently outlined his political strategy for dealing with the Republican majority. \u201cI\u2019m not going to spend the next two years on defense.\u201d\n\nThe GOP should take note. Recognizing this reality, a diverse group of thought leaders and concerned citizens has recently published the citizens\u2019 mandate. This document calls for congressional action and provides a playbook for the legislative branch to challenge executive overreach, abuses of power and failures in national security.\n\nIn clear and simple terms, the citizens\u2019 mandate urges Congress to pursue policy initiatives that are true to the principles of smaller government and individual rights. The mandate urges congressional leaders in the GOP to focus on returning to principles of smaller government, accountability, and market-based solutions.\n\nThe mandate\u2019s prescriptions include specific steps toward real accountability. To check abuses of power, congressional hearings should investigate lawlessness in the Obama administration, from the Benghazi cover-up to Operation Fast and Furious gun-running to the Internal Revenue Service\u2019s illegal targeting of conservative groups. Congressional committees should each produce a biannual report spotlighting waste, fraud and abuse by administrative agencies, from the IRS to the National Labor Relations Board to the Environmental Protection Agency. These reports would also expose bureaucratic obstruction, nullification of laws, and vindictive agency actions designed to punish or intimidate political adversaries.\n\nThe Democrats\u2019 resounding defeat in the midterms has not affected Mr. Obama\u2019s game strategy. He seems to have concluded that it makes sense to stay on the offensive when you cannot defend the indefensible. The alternative, surely, is daunting:\n\nHe would need to acknowledge gross overreach in his wildly unpopular health care legislation and work with the 114th Congress to develop a bipartisan approach to fix Obamacare.\n\nHe would need to acknowledge his foreign policy failures and work with Congress to answer the threat posed by violent Islamic jihadists such as ISIS, a resurgent Al Qaeda, Boko Haram, and other groups.\n\nHe would need to hold accountable those responsible for murdering four brave Americans in Benghazi on the eve of his reelection.\n\nHe would need to stop exceeding his constitutional authority and begin to respect the coequal branches of our federal government by upholding the laws and retracting his executive amnesty actions.\n\nHe would need to require his administration to clean house, to stop the jaw-dropping abuses of power, and to prosecute those responsible for criminal conduct, including the investigation and prosecution of journalists in violation of free speech and DOJ guidelines and the unilateral and illegal release of five Taliban commanders in exchange for Bowe Bergdahl.\n\nInstead, with the fourth quarter\u2019s opening buzzer, Obama chose to ignore the election results and to press on. While minimizing the GOP\u2019s electoral results as \u201ca good night\u201d \u2014 a nice little aberration, aren\u2019t they cute sometimes? \u2014 he was quick to add that \u201ctwo-thirds of voters that chose not to participate in the process yesterday,\u201d as if those were abstentions that invalidated the result.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Gayle Trotter", "description": "Congressional Republicans are the only thing standing in the way of Obama's agenda, and they're chickening out.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "The decisive midterm election results have done little to affect President Obama\u2019s determination to continue to expand government.
