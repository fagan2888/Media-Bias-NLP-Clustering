An effort to shoplift a number of items from a WalMart in Fort Walton Beach puts three people behind bars.

Okaloosa County Sheriff's officials say around 6:30 Friday evening, two females, later identified as Rashavia Manuel, and Lauren Pinkney walked out of Walmart with shopping carts full of unpaid items.

When they were approached by deputies, they ran.

The driver, Freedie McCrea, sped off, but Okaloosa County Sheriff's deputies found him moments later hiding in a dumpster.

They then found Manuel, and Pinkney in the women's bathroom at the Panda Express Resaturant.

McCrea is charged with fleeing the scene, and driving with a revoked license.

Manuel was charged with theft, and possession of marijuana, and Pinkney is charged with theft.
