Play this clip from the new \u201cSleep\u201d album by British music composer Max Richter.\n\nFans of the HBO show The Leftovers and the movie Shutter Island may recognize Richter\u2019s name from the accompanying soundtracks, Time reported. Only now Richter isn\u2019t so much trying to haunt you as he is trying to get you to slow down and sleep. To make sure his music would effectively lull listeners, Richter consulted author and neuroscientist Dr. David Eagleman of the Baylor College of Medicine in Texas over the two years he spent composing the album.\n\nThe final product is a \u201cperfect lullaby for a frenetic world,\u201d Richter told Time.\n\nClassical music has previously been shown to help people fall asleep. The Huffington Post cited a 2005 study that found seniors with sleep problems improved their sleep quality when they listened to subdued classical music at least 45 minutes before they went to bed. Time added, too, that more recent research from the British Academy of Sound Therapy found that a relaxing song called \u201cWeightless\u201d could reduce a womens' heart rate by 35 percent among women \u2014 that was more than Mozart and Coldplay.\n\nRichter will debut the full album during a series of live performances scheduled for this fall in Berlin. The series will begin at midnight and end at 8 a.m., at which point Richter will ask the audience about their experience. \"We basically will play in the round, so the band is in the middle, and ringed around it are four or five hundred beds,\" Richter told NPR.\n\nBut you don\u2019t have to be in Berlin to get a feel for this album. Check out the video above for a sample of Richter's sleepy track titled \"Dream 13.\"", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "max, richter, british, music, composer, consults, science, design, 8, hour, sleep, album", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Max Richter and neuroscientist David Eagleman spent the last two years working together to compose special music to fall asleep to.", "title": "Listen To A Clip Of The Album Designed To Put You To Sleep", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/max-richter-british-music-composer-consults-science-design-8-hour-sleep-album-351404", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured_video/public/2015/09/06/max-richter-british-music-composer-releases-sleep-album-people-who-have-trouble.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Max Richter and neuroscientist David Eagleman spent the last two years working together to compose special music to fall asleep to.", "title": "Listen To A Clip Of The Album Designed To Put You To Sleep", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/max-richter-british-music-composer-consults-science-design-8-hour-sleep-album-351404", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured_video/public/2015/09/06/max-richter-british-music-composer-releases-sleep-album-people-who-have-trouble.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/09/06/max-richter-british-music-composer-releases-sleep-album-people-who-have-trouble.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Vitality", "published_time": "2015-09-06T15:43:26-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-09-06T23:12:37-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Max Richter and neuroscientist David Eagleman spent the last two years working together to compose special music to fall asleep to."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9bd5\"", "article_summary": "Play this clip from the new \u201cSleep\u201d album by British music composer Max Richter.\nThe final product is a \u201cperfect lullaby for a frenetic world,\u201d Richter told Time.\nOnly now Richter isn\u2019t so much trying to haunt you as he is trying to get you to slow down and sleep.\nRichter will debut the full album during a series of live performances scheduled for this fall in Berlin.\n\"We basically will play in the round, so the band is in the middle, and ringed around it are four or five hundred beds,\" Richter told NPR."}
