You can never be too prepared and now is the time to start gathering your documents.\u201d\n\n2014 TAX CHANGES AND ADJUSTMENTS\n\nThe new Affordable Care Act (ACA) penalty for non-compliance\n\nPotential individual exceptions to the ACA penalty\n\nA streamlined, standard home office deduction available\n\nThe standard mileage rate for business use of an automobile has changed to 56 cents per mile (57.5 cents for 2015)\n\nLimits for retirement plan contributions such as IRAs and 401(k) plans have increased\n\nThe loss of the applicability of Health Reimbursement Accounts (HRAs)\n\n\u201cAs Congress considers tax reform this year, it is important that the small business community be included in any overhaul of the tax system. To ensure fairness, sole proprietors and small employers on Main Street should also be part of any comprehensive tax reform just like their corporate counterparts on Wall Street,\u201d concluded Hall.\n\nSmall employers across the nation are part of the largest small business demographic of 27 million self-employed and micro-businesses, according to newly released 2012 U.S. Census statistics. This is an increase of 80,822 self-employed (55,165) and micro-businesses (25,657) nationally over 2011. In fact, 2012 represents a peak year for the self-employed with an average growth rate of 2.86 percent over the last 10 years (more than any other small business demographic).\n\n*latest information available from 2012 provided by the U.S. Census Bureau Statistics on Nonemployer and U.S. Small Businesses\n\nTIPS FOR FILING\n\nYou are not alone: use many of the countless NASE resources available to help you through your preparation, in addition the SBA and local Small Business Development centers are standing by to help\n\nuse many of the countless NASE resources available to help you through your preparation, in addition the SBA and local Small Business Development centers are standing by to help Get details straight from the source: bookmark the IRS website in order to get the details you need\n\nbookmark the IRS website in order to get the details you need Look for hidden deductions: many people overlook deductions that could save thousands of dollars\n\nmany people overlook deductions that could save thousands of dollars File Electronically to avoid math errors\n\nAvoid shortcuts\n\nIf you just can\u2019t get it done, you can ask for more time\n\nThe NASE advocates for fairness and simplification in the nation\u2019s tax code. Not only should adjustments be made to the corporate tax rate, but also the individual rate \u2013 the rate at which the majority of the self-employed and small employers\u2019 taxes are calculated.\n\nThe NASE is also a leading supporter of the Small Business Healthcare Relief Act, which would allow for the continued utilization of standalone health reimbursement arrangements (HRAs) for small employers (49 or less employees). These HRA arrangements have currently been disqualified under the new regulations outlined in the Affordable Care Act - a major change for the small business community this year. The Administration has recently delayed the implementation of this regulation for the short-term, but a long-term bipartisan solution is needed to address this issue.", "article_metadata": {"description": "With a month until the April 15 deadline when millions of Americans and small businesses must file their 2014 tax returns, the National Association for the Self-Employed (NASE), has released a list of changes and updates to the tax code along with ...", "og": {"site_name": "CPA Practice Advisor", "description": "With a month until the April 15 deadline when millions of Americans and small businesses must file their 2014 tax returns, the National Association for the Self-Employed (NASE), has released a list of changes and updates to the tax code along with ...", "title": "The Top Income Tax Changes for Small Businesses and Self-Employed", "url": "http://www.cpapracticeadvisor.com/news/12055578/the-top-income-tax-changes-for-small-businesses-and-self-employed", "image": {"width": 1280, "identifier": "http://r1.cpapracticeadvisor.com/files/base/CSN/image/2015/02/16x9/1280x720/Self_Employed_1_.54d28051c8e33.jpg", "height": 720}, "type": "article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 203013999739730}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "keywords": "Small Businesses, Small business, small busineses, small employers, small business taxes, self-employment", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf0fe\"", "article_summary": "Small employers across the nation are part of the largest small business demographic of 27 million self-employed and micro-businesses, according to newly released 2012 U.S. Census statistics.\nNot only should adjustments be made to the corporate tax rate, but also the individual rate \u2013 the rate at which the majority of the self-employed and small employers\u2019 taxes are calculated.\nThese HRA arrangements have currently been disqualified under the new regulations outlined in the Affordable Care Act - a major change for the small business community this year.\n\u201cThe number one thing individuals and small businesses across the country can do now to prepare for tax season is educate themselves about the changes and new adjustments to the tax code,\u201d said Keith Hall, President and CEO of NASE.\nTo ensure fairness, sole proprietors and small employers on Main Street should also be part of any comprehensive tax reform just like their corporate counterparts on Wall Street,\u201d concluded Hall."}
