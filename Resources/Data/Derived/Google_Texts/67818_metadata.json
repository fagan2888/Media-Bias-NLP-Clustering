One was that I, too, was writing a lot, debunking one bad argument for privatization after another. It wasn\u2019t the first time I had done that kind of thing, but this was different in two ways: it was really intense, and for once my side of the argument won the political fight.\n\nIt was also a formative period for my perceptions of how policy arguments actually play out in modern America. There are always three sides here: the right, which isn\u2019t interested in facts or logic; the left (which isn\u2019t very leftist in this country \u2014 they\u2019re really center-left by anyone else\u2019s standards); and self-proclaimed centrists, who have very little in the way of a constituency in the country at large but have a lot of influence inside the Beltway.\n\nAnd what you learned early on in the Social Security debate was that centrists desperately want to believe that there is symmetry between the left and the right, that Democrats and Republicans are equally extreme in their own way. And this means that they are always looking for ways to say nice things about Republicans and their policy proposals, no matter how bad those proposals are. That\u2019s how Paul Ryan ended up getting an award for fiscal responsibility.\n\nSo back in 2005, Bush was making a dubious claim coupled with a complete non sequitur. First, the claim that Social Security was in crisis; second, that privatization was the answer, even though it would do nothing at all to help the system\u2019s finances. How could centrists say nice things about such a crude bait-and-switch?\n\nWell, here\u2019s Joe Klein in 2005:\n\nI agree with Paul [Krugman] in that private accounts have nothing to do with solvency and solvency is the issue. I disagree with Paul because I think private accounts [are] a terrific policy and that in the information age, you\u2019re going to need different kinds of structures in the entitlement area than you had in the industrial age. But it is very hard to do that kind of change under these political circumstances where you have the parties at such loggerheads. The Democrats have for the last 10 or 15 years blatantly, shamelessly demagogued this issue. They\u2019ve offered nothing positive on Social Security or on Medicare or on Medicaid, and it\u2019s time for them to compromise here.\n\nSay what? To his credit, Klein later admitted that he was all wrong here. But the point is that what we saw here was the instinct to come up with something, anything, that would let centrists pretend symmetry between the parties.\n\nIncidentally, about Democrats doing nothing about Medicare and Medicaid: it\u2019s interesting to look at budget projections made around the time of the Social Security debate. Back then CBO projected that by fiscal 2014 Medicare spending would rise to $708 billion and Medicaid spending to $361 billion. The actual numbers for 2014 were 600 and 301, respectively, despite the Medicaid expansion under Obamacare. At least some of this unexpectedly low cost can be attributed to measures included in the Affordable Care Act. And strange to say, this was achieved without destroying or privatizing the programs.\n\nBut back to 2005: what Harry Reid realized was that it was time to stop courting the Very Serious People and instead make an alliance with the DFHs \u2014 which isn\u2019t quite shorthand for Dirty Foolish Hippies \u2014 who, unlike the VSPs, were actually making sense on both the policy and the politics. It was an important turning point.", "article_metadata": {"ptime": 20150328154555, "BN": "krugman", "dfp-ad-unit-path": "opinion/krugman", "DISPLAYDATE": "March 28, 2015", "keywords": "Uncategorized", "communityAssetTaxonomy": "blogs/krugman/Privatization Memories ( 20150328 )", "PT": "Blogs", "SCG": "krugman", "sourceApp": "blogs", "twitter": {"description": "Harry Reid turns from VSPs to DFHs.", "title": "Privatization Memories", "url": "http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/03/28/privatization-memories/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "site": "@NytimesKrugman", "card": "summary"}, "adxPage": "blog.nytimes.com/krugman/post", "description": "Harry Reid turns from VSPs to DFHs.", "CG": "Opinion", "robots": "noodp", "dat": "March 28, 2015", "article": {"published_time": 1427571955, "author": "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/opinion/editorialsandoped/oped/columnists/paulkrugman/index.html", "section": "Opinion", "collection": "http://json8.nytimes.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "tag": "Uncategorized", "modified_time": "2015-03-28T19:45:55-04:00"}, "utime": 20150328194555, "communityAssetLabels": "NYT_Blogs", "PUD": 20150328, "pdate": 20150328, "thumbnail": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "og": {"site_name": "Paul Krugman Blog", "description": "Harry Reid turns from VSPs to DFHs.", "title": "Privatization Memories", "url": "http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/03/28/privatization-memories/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/blogs_v5/../icons/t_logo_291_black.png", "type": "article"}, "communityAssetURL": "http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/03/28/privatization-memories/", "PUV": "normal", "hdl": "Privatization Memories", "thumbnail_150": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "PST": "Blog Post"}, "article_summary": "First, the claim that Social Security was in crisis; second, that privatization was the answer, even though it would do nothing at all to help the system\u2019s finances.\nOne was that I, too, was writing a lot, debunking one bad argument for privatization after another.\nHow could centrists say nice things about such a crude bait-and-switch?\nThey\u2019ve offered nothing positive on Social Security or on Medicare or on Medicaid, and it\u2019s time for them to compromise here.\nIncidentally, about Democrats doing nothing about Medicare and Medicaid: it\u2019s interesting to look at budget projections made around the time of the Social Security debate."}
