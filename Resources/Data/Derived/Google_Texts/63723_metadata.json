Making those solutions stick is another thing altogether.\n\nWhen it comes to health care, the enactment of the Affordable Care Act, rather than tamping down chatter about how to insure people, seems only to have spurred more of it.\n\nBut you know what? There's a reason some problems are long-standing. They may have no easy solution. Or the solution isn't politically feasible. Or there's a solution that sounds good on the campaign trail but isn't likely to actually work.\n\nIn the first of a series of videos about health policy promises that sound like a good idea but maybe aren't, Julie Rovner explores why increasing competition in health insurance by allowing sales of policies across state lines might not be such a hot idea after all.\n\nOne of the seven planks outlined by Donald Trump in a health plan his campaign released in March calls for interstate sales of insurance.\n\nWatch and listen as Julie explains why selling insurance across state lines isn't all it's cracked up to be.
