Hospital leaders say they've reached an agreement to manage Monroe County Hospital. Claire Davis spoke with County Commission Chairman Michael Bilderback who says he hopes the joint venture will help keep the hospital's doors open.\n\nMonroe County Hospital sits in a quiet part of Forsyth, serves around 400 - 500 patients a year and has a 25 patient bed capacity.\n\n\n\nCounty Commission Chairman Michael Bilderback says the county has subsidized the hospital over the years and he hopes their new partnership with Navicent Health will eliminate that. \u201cThe Affordable Care Act has caused a lot of distress to rural hospitals, ours being one of them,\u201d he said. \u201cWe were putting about $300,000 on average. Like I said one year it was 700, one year it was 250,\u201d said Bilderback.\n\n\n\nBilderback says commission has always backed the hospital because the county needs it. \u201cIndustry likes to have medical care very close by.\n\nSo for us to retain the hospital services it's important for a number of reasons. But economic development is probably one of the largest reasons,\u201d said Bilderback.\n\n\n\nHe says he hopes to see the employees of Monroe County hospital under the employment umbrella of Navicent, ultimately saving even more money. \u201cYour personnel costs are your greatest costs when you're providing a service,\u201d said Bilderback.\n\nSeveral patients at the hospital say they\u2019re looking forward to Navicent coming in to help manage the hospital. They say it guarantees medical care in their own backyard.\n\nMonroe County Hospital CEO Kay Floyd says the hospital board is meeting tonight to sign the final contract of the management agreement.\n\nTwo years ago, Navicent also reached an agreement to help manage Oconee Regional Hospital in Milledgeville. But Navicent ended the partnership last summer after some physicians and Baldwin County commissioners complained about a loss of local control at the hospital.\n\n(\u00a9 2016 WMAZ)", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "A deal for&nbsp;Navicent&nbsp;health to begin managing another Central Georgia hospital awaits approval from the state attorney general.", "author": "TEGNA", "og": {"site_name": "WMAZ", "description": "A deal for\u00a0Navicent\u00a0health to begin managing another Central Georgia hospital awaits approval from the state attorney general.", "title": "Navicent to manage Monroe County Hospital", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://content.13wmaz.com/photo/2016/05/18/monroehosp_1463595377830_2361950_ver1.0_640_360.JPG", "height": 360}, "url": "http://www.13wmaz.com/news/navicent-to-manage-monroe-county-hospital/201714297", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "http://www.13wmaz.com", "description": "A deal for\u00a0Navicent\u00a0health to begin managing another Central Georgia hospital awaits approval from the state attorney general.", "title": "Navicent to manage Monroe County Hospital", "image": {"src": "http://content.13wmaz.com/photo/2016/05/18/monroehosp_1463595377830_2361950_ver1.0_640_360.JPG"}, "site": "@13WMAZNEWS", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"app_id": 167667113279341}, "keywords": "health,hospital,News,Facebook-Instant,Where-You-Live,Local,Health", "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1280"}, "article_summary": "Navicent to manage Monroe hospital (Photo: Davis, Claire, WMAZ)A deal for Navicent health to begin managing another Central Georgia hospital awaits approval from the state attorney general.\nHospital leaders say they've reached an agreement to manage Monroe County Hospital.\nMonroe County Hospital CEO Kay Floyd says the hospital board is meeting tonight to sign the final contract of the management agreement.\nMonroe County Hospital sits in a quiet part of Forsyth, serves around 400 - 500 patients a year and has a 25 patient bed capacity.\nSeveral patients at the hospital say they\u2019re looking forward to Navicent coming in to help manage the hospital."}
