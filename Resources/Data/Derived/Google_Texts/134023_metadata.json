McConnell has sent a letter to governors across the country urging them not to comply with the plan\u2019s new rules \u2014 which direct states to set up their own plans to reduce emissions or face the imposition of a federal plan \u2014 on the grounds that they are unconstitutional and may soon be blocked in the courts.\n\nAnd this deserves more attention: McConnell\u2019s campaign is explicitly designed to undermine the administration\u2019s efforts to negotiate a global climate treaty, by sowing doubts as to whether the U.S. could uphold its end of any carbon-emissions-reducing bargain, according to Coral Davenport of the New York Times.\n\nMcConnell\u2019s argument that Obama\u2019s new proposal, the Clean Power Plan, is unconstitutional has the support of law professor Laurence Tribe, a onetime Obama mentor. Tribe says its rules commandeer the states in violation of core principles of federalism by forcing them to choose between setting up a plan according to federally mandated goals and methods, or submitting to the federal government imposing those goals in its own way \u2014 under threat of losing federal funds such as highway money. A dozen states have already filed suit to block the rules on these grounds, as have industry groups; the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals will hear several challenges next month in a preliminary hearing. The administration argues that the Clean Air Act authorizes the rules, a final version of which will be released this summer.\n\n\n\nOne of the most prominent defenders of the administration\u2019s position is Richard Revesz, the director of the Institute for Policy Integrity at New York University law school. I asked Revesz to respond to McConnell\u2019s arguments and to discuss the broader implications of his campaign; an edited and condensed version of our conversation follows.\n\n******************************************************************************\n\nTHE PLUM LINE: It seems like the stakes are enormously high here. Couldn\u2019t a number of GOP states decline to create a plan to hit carbon reduction targets \u2014 as we saw with Obamacare \u2014 while this gets resolved in the courts? If so, what would be the consequences of that?\n\nRICHARD REVESZ: The states could do that. If the states decline to participate, at some point the EPA will have the authority to issue a federal plan for them. That would be a harder sell politically. Additional legal arguments could then be leveled against the federal plan. And opponents are betting on the possibility that a Republican gets elected president in 2016. If the states don\u2019t come up with plans, and wait until the legal issues get resolved, the EPA may not get around to issuing a federal plan before the end of this administration. The Republican candidates will be pushed to take a pledge not to issue a federal plan. That could kill the whole thing if one of them wins.\n\nPLUM LINE: The D.C. Circuit Court has announced the three judges that will hear the legal challenges to the new rules, and they are all GOP appointees. Isn\u2019t there a real possibility that the D.C. Circuit could rule against the administration? What would happen then?\n\nREVESZ: The main issue that will be argued on April 16th is whether the opponents can challenge the proposed rule, which won\u2019t be finalized until some time in the summer. It would be unprecedented for a court to say that they can. The impact of an adverse decision would depend on the grounds invoked by the judges. They might say that certain interpretations of the Clean Air Act are impermissible, but might leave open the possibility of other interpretations that the administration could then use in its final rule. It\u2019s hard to imagine that they could hold that carbon emissions cannot be regulated under the Clean Air Act.\n\nBut they could certainly close down a number of legal paths that the administration might want to take in a final rule. It is clear that there is some scenario under which the D.C. Circuit could do a great deal of damage to the Clean Power Plan.\n\nPLUM LINE: McConnell and Tribe are saying that this commandeers the states, not only by setting its energy goals, but by potentially dictating the way they must achieve them, and could potentially impose penalties for the failure to do so. Given the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in striking down the Medicaid expansion, isn\u2019t this vulnerable to a legal challenge?\n\nREVESZ: I think their argument is actually frivolous. In this case, the states are given the option to come up with state plans. They don\u2019t have to do anything. In fact, McConnell is urging them not to do anything, which shows that they in fact are not compelled to do anything.\n\nThe scheme here is the bread and butter scheme under the Clean Air Act. Going back to 1970, the centerpiece of the Clean Air Act \u2014 which everyone takes as its most successful component \u2014 is the national ambient air quality standards. They set the maximum permissible concentration of pollutants. Under this scheme, the EPA comes up with the maximum permissible concentrations. The states then have a period within which come up with state implementation plans. If they don\u2019t, EPA imposes a federal plan. We\u2019ve been basically administering this system for 45 years. The system under the Clean Power Plan is modeled on that system. The opponents are essentially arguing that the centerpiece provisions of the Clean Air Act \u2014 which have had bipartisan support going back to the Nixon administration \u2014 are somehow Constitutionally deficient.\n\nPLUM LINE: But doesn\u2019t this still force the states to choose between meeting federally mandated goals with predetermined methods, or submitting to the federal government imposing those goals in its own way \u2014 what they call a Hobson\u2019s choice? Isn\u2019t there coercion of the states here?\n\nREVESZ: That is the scheme under national air quality standards. The states can come up with an implementation plan using any methods they like, but if they don\u2019t, the federal government comes up with a plan for them. There have been many federal implementation plans under national air quality standards that have been upheld by the courts for decades. The Clean Power Plan has exactly the same system. This is not like the Affordable Care Act case, where potentially the loss of enormous amounts of Medicaid funding were at stake, and the states did not have a realistic choice.\n\nPLUM LINE: Aren\u2019t there still penalties of some kind imposed for not coming up with a plan? Is money lost?\n\nREVESZ: The main penalty is that if the federal government comes up with a plan, the state loses some options it otherwise would have. There\u2019s probably no money lost. Under the national air quality standards \u2014 which have been around for 45 years \u2014 the states actually can lose highway funds. It appears that states might not lose any funds here. But even if they lost some funds, that would be just like the provisions of the national air quality standards, which have been upheld for a long time. It\u2019s not the case that losing funds makes this a constitutional violation. It\u2019s the enormous magnitude of the loss of funds in the Medicaid case that made that an exception.\n\nStill, the more likely interpretation is that under this provision, no highway funds would be lost at all.\n\nPLUM LINE: It\u2019s remarkable that McConnell appears to be deliberately trying to damage the administration efforts to reach a global climate deal by sowing doubts as to whether the U.S. can meet its end of the bargain.\n\nREVESZ: It\u2019s part and parcel of the Republican strategy to undermine the president\u2019s conduct of foreign affairs. It\u2019s like Tom Cotton\u2019s open letter to Iran.\n\nPLUM LINE: Is there a plausible chance that it could work? What\u2019s the worst case scenario?\n\nREVESZ: It\u2019s always plausible that enough questions could be raised in foreign countries about the ability of the United States to carry out its commitments. I regard the decision by China to reduce its greenhouse gases to be very significant, and I don\u2019t think China would have done it if it had not believed the U.S. is committed to reducing its own greenhouse gases. The U.S. approach is likely to bring other countries into the fold as well.\n\nIf McConnell succeeds in convincing enough foreign countries that the administration\u2019s view is wrong, which I doubt will be the case, it could have a serious impact on the probability that other countries would make significant commitments to reducing their own greenhouse gases.\n\n*******************************************************************************\n\nNote: For a deeper look at the intricacies of the legal dispute here, read McConnell\u2019s letter to governors and Tribe\u2019s recent testimony to Congress, and Revesz\u2019s detailed response.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A worst-case scenario.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/WashingtonPostPlumLine?ref=hl", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "A worst-case scenario.", "title": "Mitch McConnell has a plan to derail Obama\u2019s climate agenda.
