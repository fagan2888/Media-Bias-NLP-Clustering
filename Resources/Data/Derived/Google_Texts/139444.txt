Two Dallas-area doctors have been charged, according to a superseding indictment that was unsealed Friday, for their alleged participation in a $13.4 million health care fraud scheme that bilked Medicare for millions.

Dr. Kelly Robinett, 66, of Denton County, Texas and Dr. Angel Claudio, 60, of Hood County, Texas were each charged with one count of conspiracy to commit healthcare fraud. They were also charged with multiple counts of health care fraud, announced the U.S. Attorney's office.

Robinett owns Boomer Housecalls, which is based in Frisco, Texas. Claudio, a medical doctor, works for Dallas-based Texas Medical Housecalls, the U.S. Attorney's office said.

Patience Okoroji, 57, of Dallas County, Usani Ewah, 58, of Dallas County, Kingsley Nwanguma, 45, of Dallas County and Joy Ogwuegbu, 39, of Collin County who are charged in the current indictment, were also charged in a previous indictment that did not include the doctors.

Authorities said Okoroji and Ewah co-owned Timely Home Health Services Inc. (Timely), where Okoroji was an administrator and licensed vocational nurse. Ewah was the director of nursing and a registered nurse for Timely, Nwanguma was a licensed vocational nurse for Timely and Ogwuegbu was its former director of nursing.

The allegations accuse Robinett and Claudio of falsely certifying beneficiaries for home health care when the patients weren't actually under their care and did not qualify for home health services. The defendants allegedly billed Medicare approximately $13,434,550 based on false home health certification signed by doctors, including Robinett and Claudio, as well as false and fraudulent claims for home health services, said the U.S. Attorney's office.
