Is Trump Paving the Way for Ted Cruz?

"I can’t believe I’m saying this. But I might prefer President Trump," writes liberal columnist Ruth Marcus for the Washington Post in a piece declaring Texas Senator Ted Cruz "more dangerous" than the real estate mogul. Marcus argues that Trump would be far more likely to cut deals with Democrats "on taxes, on funding Planned Parenthood, on implementing Obamacare, you name it." Cruz, by contrast, would die hard on such issues.

Marcus offers an enlightening glimpse into the fears of the political establishment. Of particular note is this unexpected benefit of Trump's candidacy:

... Trump’s ascendancy and the outrageousness of his pronouncements have made Cruz appear like the more reasonable alternative. As Sen. Dean Heller (R-Nev.) told me in an interview for Washington Post Live, “I don’t think six months ago anybody would have thought that Ted Cruz was mainstream. . . . Trump has made Cruz mainstream.”

That's one way to look at it. Perhaps the Republican Party will ultimately end up with a nominee other-than-Trump who Trump effectively enables. Wouldn't that be something?
