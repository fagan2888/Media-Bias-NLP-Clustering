Large gatherings were also seen in the capital Brasilia, Rio de Janeiro and the southern city of Porto Alegre.\n\nRousseff didn\u2019t appear in public, but government ministers held a nationally televised press conference in which they said they would introduce anti-corruption measures in Congress, action the president promised during her campaign for re-election in October.\n\n\u201cWe are here to express our indignation with the government-sponsored corruption and thieving, and to demand Dilma\u2019s impeachment,\u201d said Andre Menezes, 35, protesting on Avenida Paulista in Sao Paulo.\n\n\u201cShe may have not been directly involved in the corruption at Petrobras, but she certainly knew about it, and for me that makes her just as guilty and justifies her ouster,\u201d he added.\n\nIn Rio, police estimated 15,000 people marched along the golden sands of Copacabana beach, where they waved Brazilian flags and many openly called for a military coup to dissolve the government.\n\nIn contrast to the widespread violence seen during Brazil\u2019s 2013 protests, on Sunday the only conflict reported was police using tear gas and stun grenades to disperse a small group of protesters in Brasilia who authorities said were trying to enter the Congress. In Sao Paulo, police arrested about 20 young men who were carrying powerful fireworks and brass knuckles.\n\nJustice Minister Jose Eduardo Cardozo defended the government, emphasizing Rousseff\u2019s record as a leftist guerrilla who stood up to Brazil\u2019s 1964-85 military regime \u2014 and who was jailed for three years and brutally tortured because of it.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Mass protests present big challenge to Brazil\u2019s Rousseff", "author": "Brad Brooks and Stan Lehman", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Mass protests present big challenge to Brazil\u2019s Rousseff", "title": "Mass protests present big challenge to Brazil\u2019s Rousseff", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/03/16/mass_protests_present_big_challenge_to_brazils_rousseff/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/03/aptopix-brazil-protests.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Mass protests present big challenge to Brazil\u2019s Rousseff", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/03/aptopix-brazil-protests.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "title": "Mass protests present big challenge to Brazil\u2019s Rousseff", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Mass protests present big challenge to Brazil\u2019s Rousseff", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe04b9\"", "article_summary": "In Sao Paulo, police arrested about 20 young men who were carrying powerful fireworks and brass knuckles.\nThe biggest protest was seen in Sao Paulo, where some 210,000 people gathered on a main avenue, according to the polling and statistics firm Datafolha.\n\u201cWe are here to express our indignation with the government-sponsored corruption and thieving, and to demand Dilma\u2019s impeachment,\u201d said Andre Menezes, 35, protesting on Avenida Paulista in Sao Paulo.\nLarge gatherings were also seen in the capital Brasilia, Rio de Janeiro and the southern city of Porto Alegre.\nThe Sunday protests, organized by right-leaning groups on social media and held across the continent-sized nation, had none of the violence seen in massive anti-government demonstrations that hit the country in 2013 and lingered into the following year."}
