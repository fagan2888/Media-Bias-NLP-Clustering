Waxman, Levin, Becerra and Miller urged members to oppose the bill. | AP Photos House rejects expatriate ACA bill\n\nThe House on Wednesday rejected a bipartisan bill that would have changed how expatriates and their insurance carriers comply with Obamacare, amid strong opposition from senior Democrats who said it created large loopholes in the health law.\n\nThe bill, H.R. 4414, fell 257-159. Republican leaders brought the bill to the floor under suspension of the rules, a procedure that requires support from two-thirds of members voting. It\u2019s usually used for noncontroversial legislation, but opposition to this bill mounted all day, leading to its surprise defeat.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nIf it were brought up again under a simple majority vote, it would most likely have enough votes to pass.\n\nThe proposal would have softened the health law\u2019s rules for insurance companies who cover people who work outside of the United States, or for foreigners who live in the country. But several top Democrats urged members to oppose the bill amid concern that it defined \u201cexpatriates\u201d so broadly that it would carve out big exemptions for health plans and the people they cover.\n\nThe bill was sponsored by Democratic Rep. John Carney of Delaware and Republican Rep. Devin Nunes of California.\n\nThe Obama administration had urged the House to postpone the vote to address concerns that the legislation could \u201cundermine essential protections for American workers.\u201d\n\nThere is bipartisan agreement that the health law may need some tweaks for insurers who offer plans to expatriates, citing the additional cost they have to operate outside of the country. But top Democrats \u2014 including Reps. Henry Waxman, Sander Levin, George Miller and Xavier Becerra \u2014 said this bill went way too far. They said it would create major loopholes to allow insurance companies to \u201cavoid their responsibilities under the law and sell inferior insurance policies\u201d in the United States, according to a letter they circulated to colleagues on Wednesday.\n\nBill sponsor Carney defended the legislation as fair to the American businesses. \u201cForeign plans don\u2019t have to comply with the Affordable Care Act,\u201d he said. Forcing U.S. expatriate insurance plans to comply with the Affordable Care Act gives their foreign competitors \u201ca distinct advantage,\u201d he said.\n\nCritics said Carney stretched the definitions too far. Under the bill, any insurance plan for an American who is out of the country for 90 days or 15 trips or a foreigner working in the United States who is gone from his or her country for 90 days or 15 trips would be exempt from the Affordable Care Act. Their families would be exempt, too. That means they are exempt from all of it \u2014 from requiring young adults under age 26 to stay on a parents plans to the new mandatory coverage benefits. And the health plans wouldn\u2019t have to pay ACA-related taxes and fees.\n\nLabor and immigration groups, such as the AFL-CIO and the SEIU, oppose the bill, too. They say it would encourage companies to hire foreign workers instead of Americans, because they wouldn\u2019t have to provide the same comprehensive coverage. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce supported the bill.\n\n\u201cThis bill contains too many loopholes that amount to an extraordinary bailout for insurance companies,\u201d Rep. Jim McDermott (D-Wash.) said on the House floor.\n\n\u201dThis is a bill for an insurance company that is threatening to fire people in the district \u2026 in Delaware and a little small part of California,\u201d Waxman said, referring to the districts of the two sponsors and the insurance company Cigna.\n\nCigna, which has operations in Delaware, did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nNunes and Carney pegged their legislation as a jobs bill and said it would save at least 1,000 jobs in their districts alone. They say that the health law now has incentives for companies to use foreign insurers because it is too costly for American companies to comply with it.\n\nNunes said the bill was drafted after \u201cextensive discussions with the Obama administration.\u201d While the administration was consulted and indicated that it\u2019s open to adjusting the expatriate rules, it did not back this bill.\n\nJoanne Kenen contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "The bill would have softened Obamacare rules for companies covering those outside of the U.S.", "title": "House rejects expatriate ACA bill", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2014/04/house-rejects-expatriate-obamacare-affordable-care-act-bill-105551.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2014/04/09/140409_democrats_aps_6051.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Obamacare,Health Care,Affordable Care Act,Health Insurance", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "The bill would have softened Obamacare rules for companies covering those outside of the U.S.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdeb64\"", "article_summary": "| AP Photos House rejects expatriate ACA billThe House on Wednesday rejected a bipartisan bill that would have changed how expatriates and their insurance carriers comply with Obamacare, amid strong opposition from senior Democrats who said it created large loopholes in the health law.\n\u201cThis bill contains too many loopholes that amount to an extraordinary bailout for insurance companies,\u201d Rep.
