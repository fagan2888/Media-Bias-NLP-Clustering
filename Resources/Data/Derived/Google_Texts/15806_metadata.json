CoOpportunity Health, the CO-OP plan in Iowa and Nebraska, failed at the end of last year; state insurance regulators took control and moved to liquidate the plan when it was deemed financially insolvent. Other reports have speculated that other CO-OPs may face similar fates.\n\nBut this perhaps inevitable emphasis on the negative aspects of a federally spawned program misses the forest for the trees. CO-OPs reflect a fundamental reorientation of the relationship between plan and patient, one of the scarce revolutions in our system going on that truly merits the title \u201chealth reform.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nBy law, CO-OPs are member-directed and true nonprofits. What that means is our boards are not solely comprised by well-heeled executives and industry insiders. They are populated by our members \u2013 the people our plan serves. This is a real and powerful deviation from status quo health plan practice. Instead of an overarching emphasis on profit margins, our board is devoted to the wellbeing and consumer experience of our members. Instead of getting too caught up in policy trends and shiny vendor pamphlets, they consider the practical implications \u2013 especially to cost and health \u2013 for our enrollees.\n\nAnd the market is responding. This year, Colorado HealthOP has over 75,000 members enrolled in our individual market health plans. That\u2019s an over 40 percent share of the individual Exchange market, quite a bit considering we launched only a little over a year ago. This has also made us the \u201cbenchmark silver plan\u201d for purposes of calculating subsidies for Exchange enrollees in all counties save one, putting us in the driver\u2019s seat to reduce healthcare costs and premiums statewide. Rates in the individual market in Colorado rose less than one percent from 2014 to 2015. Yes, we are taking some credit for that.\n\nIt is in our DNA to prioritize quality and value via evidence-based approaches to care. For example, our members receive enhanced benefits if they take three critical steps to manage their health: (1) complete a health risk assessment; (2) get a biometric screening; and (3) come in for their annual wellness visit. We don\u2019t charge out-of-pocket for primary care visits, mental healthcare or generic drugs for certain high cost conditions and leverage \u201cextension agents\u201d in rural areas to ensure basic preventive and primary care needs are met in those regions. These are bona fide investments in health and they are already paying dividends.\n\nTo be sure, all is not hunky-dory in CO-OP land. We are start-ups. That means we have growing pains. Capital is not always easy to come by. At our outset, we were dependent on Federal loans to cover costs and ensure adequate solvency reserves. The vast majority of the funding initially allocated to CO-OPs was cut by Congress to offset other spending. In fairness to them, those cuts were enacted before our plans really took off in our markets: they knew not what they did, you might say. But we have been forced to modify our business plans, to say the least, to overcome these unexpected turns.\n\nThe good news is there are some very modest policy steps the Federal government could take that would go a long way to easing the financial challenges some CO-OPs now face. Relative to the multi-billion dollar bait-and-switch we\u2019ve experienced, where future funding was pulled out from under us, we think these solutions are practical, actionable, and would have only nominal impacts on the Federal ledger.\n\nApologies that these issues quickly get esoteric, but one relatively straightforward action the Administration could take would be to allow us to convert our \u201cstart-up\u201d loans to \u201csolvency\u201d loans. The amount of money wouldn\u2019t change; we\u2019d simply be able to use those dollars to meet state and Federal financial reserve requirements. That\u2019s something we can\u2019t currently do thanks to outdated restrictions in the CO-OP program.\n\nFurther, the administration could allow us to \u201cbank\u201d future receivables under the federal reinsurance program to ease our access to private, third party sources of capital. Paradoxically, perhaps, our initial reliance on federal dollars has substantially restricted our ability to become self-sufficient by finding new partners and funding sources. This one change would go a long way to remedying that inefficiency in the CO-OP program.\n\nAt Colorado HealthOP, we pride ourselves in being \u201cCO-OPy.\u201d That means we use scientifically valid approaches to improving care; it means we actively pursue \u2013 not passively avoid \u2013 underserved areas and populations; and it means every day we build a creative, entrepreneurial approach to solving problems. But, most of all, it means our first priority is and always is our members. In case you didn\u2019t know, that\u2019s something new, a revolution even. And it\u2019s worth hanging on to.\n\nHutchins is the CEO of Colorado HealthOP.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Instead of an overarching emphasis on profit margins, our board is devoted to the wellbeing and consumer experience of our members.", "description": "Instead of an overarching emphasis on profit margins, our board is devoted to the wellbeing and consumer experience of our members.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "rdfs": {"label skos": {"prefLabel": "Congress Blog"}}, "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "Instead of an overarching emphasis on profit margins, our board is devoted to the wellbeing and consumer experience of our members.", "title": "When the revolution comes, I\u2019ll be in a CO-OP", "url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/healthcare/238109-when-the-revolution-comes-ill-be-in-a-co-op", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/thehill_logo_200.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-04T03:39:59-05:00", "type": "article"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-04T03:39-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/healthcare/238109-when-the-revolution-comes-ill-be-in-a-co-op", "dcterms.date": "2015-04-08T14:00-04:00", "dcterms.creator": "Joe Picard", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.language": "und", "author": "Julia Hutchins", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": ",,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-04-08T14:00:03-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-04T03:39:59-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/healthcare/238109-when-the-revolution-comes-ill-be-in-a-co-op", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "Instead of an overarching emphasis on profit margins, our board is devoted to the wellbeing and consumer experience of our members.", "card": "summary", "title": "When the revolution comes, I\u2019ll be in a CO-OP"}, "dcterms.title": "When the revolution comes, I\u2019ll be in a CO-OP"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc3d7\"", "article_summary": "This is a real and powerful deviation from status quo health plan practice.\nThis year, Colorado HealthOP has over 75,000 members enrolled in our individual market health plans.\nCoOpportunity Health, the CO-OP plan in Iowa and Nebraska, failed at the end of last year; state insurance regulators took control and moved to liquidate the plan when it was deemed financially insolvent.\nIf you\u2019ve only been thumbing through recent headlines about health insurance consumer oriented and operated plans (CO-OPs), you couldn\u2019t be blamed for thinking the program is on the ropes.\nThis one change would go a long way to remedying that inefficiency in the CO-OP program."}
