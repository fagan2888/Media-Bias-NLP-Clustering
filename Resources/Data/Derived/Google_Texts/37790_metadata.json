Facebook\n\nSocial media users outraged over NSA surveillance programs: The federal government probably knows way less about you compared to Facebook. Because Facebook knows when you\u2019re more likely to fall in love, start a relationship, exchange cute notes online, and be lulled into a long-term relationship. It\u2019s true.\n\nLast week, the media behemoth\u2019s \u201cdata science\u201d unit released a somewhat unnerving write-up on its recent foray into the most titillating aspect of intimacy: statistics. The mini-study, which (we guess) was supposed to coincide with Valentine\u2019s Day, basically formalizes the social milestones of the average user\u2019s love life by reviewing timeline-posts, status updates, photos, and \u2014 of course \u2014 relationship updates. The results?\n\nGraph shows the tremendous drop from 1.67 to 1.53 posts/day that obtains on day zero of the relationship. Facebook\n\n\u201cRelationships start with a period of courtship: on Facebook, messages are exchanged, profiles are visited, posts are shared on each other's timelines,\u201d Carlos Diuk explains. \u201cThe following graph shows the average number of timeline posts exchanged between two people who are about to become a couple.\u201d\n\nMake no mistake: This gray line chart is perhaps the most accurate representation of awkward 21st century courtship available. We see how lonely hearts exchange notes at an increasing rate, only to pretty much stop once their union is announced (that is, the box labeled \u201crelationship status\u201d suddenly reads \u201cin a relationship with so and so\u201d). Cool with that? Then there\u2019s more:\n\nCouples are more likely to use cute words with each other compared to people who are not in a relationship with each other. Facebook\n\n\u201cDon't be discouraged by the decrease in online interactions, as the content of the interactions gets sweeter and more positive,\u201d Diuk continues. \u201cWe used statistical methods to automatically analyze a set of aggregated, anonymized timeline interactions. For each timeline interaction, we counted the proportion of words expressing positive emotions (like \"love,\" \"nice,\" \"happy,\" etc.) minus the proportion of words expressing negative ones (like \"hate,\" \"hurt,\" \"bad,\" etc.).\u201d\n\nThere you have it, ladies and gentlemen \u2014 love made easier than ever.\n\nAdmittedly, there are some limitations. For example, it doesn\u2019t take into account the practice of faux-weddings and other non-relationships between friends. Similarly, its language-use analysis only handles English.
