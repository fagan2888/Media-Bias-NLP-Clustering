While many children are covered under the Affordable Care Act with dental benefits, some adults are scrambling for basic dental services.

Mission of Mercy's mobile medical clinic is in high demand. Long before dawn in Reisterstown, a free walk-in dental clinic was already completely booked on a recent morning when 11 News visited.

Sharon Ford, 63, was indeed an early bird, waking at 4:30 a.m., for one of the first come, first serve spots. She is in pain and thinks she needs a tooth pulled.

"It's expensive to have dental work done and you find something like this, it's worth coming early as long as you have to get it done," Ford said.

The clinic is run by the Mission of Mercy, a nonprofit organization that, on this day, operates the mobile clinic out of the United Methodist Church in Reisterstown.

It didn't take long at all for the church's day care room to be transformed into a dental clinic, and the sole volunteer dentist, Dr. T.L. Llewellyn, will try to see as many patients as he can.

Most of the clinic's patients are employed and while their children may be covered under Affordable Care Act plans or expanded Medicaid, the adults are not.

"It's not just a tooth pulled, it's not unusual to do five procedures," said Jennifer Charlton, executive director of the Mission of Mercy. "It's vast, it's complicated, it's important."

The dentist was able to save Ford's tooth.

"I feel great. All the pain is gone," Ford said.

A simple filling made all the difference, but filling the hole created by a lack of affordable dental care is not nearly as simple.

Given the link between oral health and overall health, the last thing volunteers want to do is send people away, so, starting in October, they will add a second clinic day to help the under-insured and uninsured.
