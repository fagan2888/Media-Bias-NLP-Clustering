It recovered and was posting slight gains then fell below the 200-day again in recent action.\n\nShutterstock\n\nThe index also dropped 21% below its Feb. 25 intraday peak right after the opening bell. A 20% drop from the most recent peak is considered by some experts to be the sign that the bears have taken over.\n\nExchange-traded funds specializing in biotech were flat to down after a dismal Thursday in which all the major funds fell 5% or more. A couple of the funds were below their 200-day moving average: The SPDR S&P Biotech ETF /quotes/zigman/477927/delayed /quotes/nls/xbi XBI and the Market Vectors Biotech ETF /quotes/zigman/7870982/delayed /quotes/nls/bbh BBH .\n\nThe First Trust NYSE Arca Biotechnology Index Fund /quotes/zigman/1497293/delayed /quotes/nls/fbt FBT remains well above the 200-day while the iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF /quotes/zigman/85342/delayed /quotes/nls/ibb IBB , tied to the Nasdaq Biotech Index, was right around the 200-day.\n\nA few individual equities struggled to get into positive ground, but the sector was largely in the red. However, stocks were not down nearly as much as they were on Thursday, when 5% losses were commonplace and 10%-plus drops weren\u2019t that rare.\n\nToday and the next few days look to be critical for biotechs.
