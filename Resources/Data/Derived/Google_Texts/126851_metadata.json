As far as politics goes, this year won\u2019t go down in American history as one of the more notable ones.\n\nBut sometimes it\u2019s the things that didn\u2019t happen that are more interesting. And some very big things didn\u2019t happen this year, even though pundits and commentators once thought they might.\n\nHere\u2019s a look at the seven biggest things that didn\u2019t happen in Washington in 2014.\n\nThe House never passed an immigration reform bill.\n\nWhat might have happened: In June of 2013, the Senate passed a bipartisan overhaul of the nation\u2019s immigration laws. The House could have voted on that bill or passed its own version.\n\n\n\nWho thought it would happen: Some Republicans. Many party leaders thought Republicans needed to put the immigration issue behind them in order to win the White House in 2016.\n\nWhy it didn\u2019t happen: House Republicans sat the issue out. Speaker John Boehner never brought the Senate bill to the House floor or offered an alternative.\n\nCould it happen next year? Not likely. When President Obama deferred deportation for millions on his own in November, Boehner argued that he had poisoned the well.\n\nThere was no big Supreme Court nomination fight.\n\nWhat might have happened: With four justices born in the 1930s, one could have retired, following in the footsteps of former Justices David Souter, Sandra Day O\u2019Connor and John Paul Stevens.\n\nWho thought it would happen: Some liberal court-watchers suggested that Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, 81, should step down to ensure a Democratic-appointed successor.\n\nWhy it didn\u2019t happen: They weren\u2019t interested. For her part, Ginsburg noted that she\u2019s still capable of doing the work and she seems to be having the time of her life.\n\nCould it happen next year? Unlikely. The combination of a Democratic president and a Republican Senate would give both liberal and conservative justices pause.\n\nRepublicans never settled on an alternative to Obamacare.\n\nWhat might have happened: Republicans in Congress could have gotten serious about the \u201creplace\u201d in \u201crepeal and replace\u201d and introduced an official alternative to the Affordable Care Act.\n\nWho thought it would happen: Former House Majority Leader Eric Cantor. In January, he said the party would \u201crally around an alternative to Obamacare and pass it on the floor of the House.\u201d\n\nWhy it didn\u2019t happen: Election-year politics. An official Republican alternative would have been a sitting target for Democratic candidates.\n\nCould it happen next year? Not likely. Republicans may now control all of Congress, but as long as they can\u2019t get their plan past the president\u2019s desk, there\u2019s little incentive to produce one.\n\nCongress didn\u2019t debate tax reform.\n\nWhat might have happened: The House Ways and Means Committee chairman Dave Camp\u2019s tax reform plan, unveiled in February, could have sparked a serious effort to reform the tax code.\n\nWho thought it would happen: Camp. He argued that Congress has an \u201cobligation to debate the big issues of the day.\u201d His plan was also praised by Rep. Paul Ryan, who called it a \u201cterrific first step.\u201d\n\nWhy it didn\u2019t happen: Election-year politics. Passing tax reform would mean picking fights with a number of special interests and handing the president a win.\n\nCould it happen next year? Probably not. Political observers now think the tax reform debate probably won\u2019t begin in earnest until at least 2017.\n\nThe government didn\u2019t shut down.\n\nWhat might have happened: Conservatives angry over President Obama\u2019s immigration and liberals angry over the repeal of some Wall Street oversight could have shut the government down.\n\nWho thought it would happen: After last year\u2019s bruising shutdown, no one thought it would happen again, but Congress came pretty close in December.\n\nWhy it didn\u2019t happen: Both sides punted. The trillion-dollar spending bill passed earlier this month funded the government through September, but it left open a fight over immigration funding.\n\nCould it happen next year? It\u2019s unlikely. Even if conservatives pick a fight over immigration next year, it would only affect one federal agency, Homeland Security.\n\nObama didn\u2019t become a powerless lame duck.\n\nWhat might have happened: President Obama could have coasted into the final, lame-duck years of his presidency, wary of taking risks that might hurt Hillary Clinton in 2016.\n\nWho thought it would happen: Some commentators and pundits already said that it had, slamming him for being passive and uninspiring.\n\nWhy it didn\u2019t happen: Obama got energized. After Democrats lost the midterms, Obama took bold steps on immigration and reopening diplomatic relations with Cuba.\n\nCould it happen next year? Certainly. There\u2019s only so much the president can do on his own, so at some point he\u2019ll be stuck either vetoing or approving Republican plans.\n\nCongress didn\u2019t find an intelligence failure on Benghazi.\n\nWhat might have happened: The House Intelligence Committee could have unveiled dramatic, damning findings after a two-year investigation into the Benghazi attacks in Libya.\n\nWho thought it would happen: Republicans. Despite multiple investigations into the attacks, many conservatives have been certain they\u2019ll find a smoking gun.\n\nWhy it didn\u2019t happen: The House committee didn\u2019t find anything. The report, which was pushed out quietly on a Friday, found \u201cno intelligence failure prior to the attacks.\u201d\n\nCould it happen next year? Unlikely. Rep. Trey Gowdy, who chairs the House Benghazi Committee, has promised more hearings, but it\u2019s hard to imagine he\u2019ll find anything new.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Sometimes it's the things that didn't happen that are the most notable.
