Speaking about Obamacare, Barnes said it\u2019s \u201cto everyone\u2019s benefit that people back off of what was the Reagan administration legacy that government is bad, government workers are bad, and think about how we\u2019re going to make this work.\u201d\n\nShe added that disasters such as Hurricane Katrina prove that \u201cif we don\u2019t have an effective federal government, people get hurt. In fact people can die.\u201d\n\nHost Joe Scarborough pushed back.\n\n\u201cWhy would I back off if I think health care policy is bad for the country in the the long run?\u201d he asked. \u201cThe federal government is not competent enough to run it, and the launch has been terrible. (The Huffington Post\u2019s) Sam Stein asks the question, \u2018Are Republicans going to do their best to help this implementation?\u2019 No, I don\u2019t think they are. And I don\u2019t think it means they\u2019re unpatriotic if they don\u2019t.\n\nScarborough continued, \u201cObviously what happened over the past few weeks, Sam, absolutely idiotic and self-defeating, but why should the Republicans say, \u2018Hey listen, we want to help you implement a program that we think will end private insurance over the next decade\u2019? That goes against everything I believe and millions and millions of Americans believe.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s the clip from MSNBC via NewsBusters:\n\n(H/T: NewsBusters)\n\n\u2013", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30; polling-uri=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/1.xml; polling-uri2=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/2.xml; polling-uri3=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/3.xml; polling-uri4=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/4.xml", "application-name": "TheBlaze.com", "twitter": {"description": "Former Obama administration official Melody Barnes says Americans opposed to Obamacare and big government should \"back off\" from their criticism -- because without effective government, people can die.
