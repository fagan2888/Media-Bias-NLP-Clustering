Results of a retrospective observational study tracking changes since the nonpayment policy was initiated showed that the incidence of hospital-associated pressure ulcers had decreased significantly among 210 academic medical centers, a clear indication that hospitals are reacting efficiently to economic policy incentives by improving prevention efforts.\n\nIt takes time for a new culture to supersede business as usual and for new habits to form; this is especially true when the threat of a penalty looms large.\n\nYes, the \"stick\" is working, but so is the \"carrot\" -- the professional satisfaction of making real progress in combatting HACs.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "David   Nash, MD, MBA, FACP", "twitter": {"url": "http://www.medpagetoday.com/Columns/FocusonPolicy/54790", "image": "http://clf1.medpagetoday.com/assets/images/defaultLede.png", "description": "For hospital-acquired conditions, the answer seems to be yes", "card": "Summary", "title": "Does a 'Stick' Work Without a 'Carrot'?"}, "dc.date.issued": "2015-11-19 16:00:00", "sailthru.is_cme": 0, "sailthru.tags": "arrhythmias,hivaids,asthma,cardiology,dermatology,endocrinology,gastroenterology,hematologyoncology,infectiousdisease,allergyimmunology,nephrology,neurology,obgyn,pediatrics,primarycare,psychiatry,publichealthpolicy,pulmonology,rheumatology,urology,ophthalmology,radiology,surgery,generaldermatology,generalhepatology,generalnephrology,generalneurology,generalpediatrics,generalpsychiatry,healthpolicy,generalrheumatology,orthopedics,generalendocrinology,generalgastroenterology,generalinfectiousdisease,generalobgyn,generalprimarycare,generalophthalmology,emergencymedicine,transplantation,painmanagement,geriatrics,anesthesiology,columns,nuclearmedicine,generalgeriatrics,genetics,generalgenetics,hospitalbasedmedicine,practicemanagement,focusonpolicy,criticalcare,generalcriticalcare,pathology,generalpathology,anemia,nursing,nursing,sportsmedicine,generalsportsmedicine", "sailthru.date": "2015-11-19 16:00:00", "sailthru.title": "Does a 'Stick' Work Without a 'Carrot'?", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "verify-v1": "Vy2WQqSVx1yA90Uu2Rw12f2R8yqP7X0cxBFbafIuqao=", "sailthru.exclude": 1, "description": "For hospital-acquired conditions, the answer seems to be yes", "sailthru.expire_date": "2015-11-20 16:11:00", "date": "2015-11-19 16:00:00", "sailthru.description": "For hospital-acquired conditions, the answer seems to be yes", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "og": {"url": "http://www.medpagetoday.com/Columns/FocusonPolicy/54790", "image": "http://clf1.medpagetoday.com/assets/images/defaultLede.png", "type": "article", "description": "For hospital-acquired conditions, the answer seems to be yes", "title": "Does a 'Stick' Work Without a 'Carrot'?"}, "sailthru.featured": 0, "dc.date": "2015-11-19 16:00:00", "sailthru.is_video": 0, "google-site-verification": "0uwxbLV_H5lccP3wm0UgRXFQ9w6ZQXh9ZLn-G0av8i0", "sailthru.speciality": "infectiousdiseases,allergyandimmunology,primarycare,anesthesiology,cardiology,dermatology,endocrinology,emergencymedicine,gastroenterology,genetics,hematologyoncology,obstetricsandgynecology,nephrology,neurology,painmanagement,ophthalmology,orthopedics,pathology,pediatrics,psychiatry,pulmonarymedicine,radiology,rheumatology,sportsmedicine,surgery,urology,criticalcare,geriatrics,otolaryngology,hospitalmedicine,hematology_oncology,pain_management,Other,Radiology", "sailthru.image.full": "http://clf1.medpagetoday.com/assets/images/defaultLede.png"}, "article_summary": "Yes, the \"stick\" is working, but so is the \"carrot\" -- the professional satisfaction of making real progress in combatting HACs.\nA study published in 2012 found no evidence that the 2008 CMS policy had any measurable effect on infection rates in U.S. hospitals.\nWell before the Affordable Care Act became the law of the land, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) implemented the Hospital-Acquired Conditions (HACs) Initiative as part of a value-based purchasing program.\nSo, is the \"stick\" working?\nIt takes time for a new culture to supersede business as usual and for new habits to form; this is especially true when the threat of a penalty looms large."}
