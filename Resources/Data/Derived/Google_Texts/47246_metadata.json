There is no family calling Thompson to the dinner table. He sits on a disheveled bed, clich\u00e9d flower paintings adorning the walls. Though he has been there for three weeks, the television menu reads \u201cWelcome to Homewood Suites.\u201d\n\nThe Homewood Suites in San Jose has been Thompson\u2019s home since he left Indiana University to begin playing for the San Jose Earthquakes. At 18, Thompson, a 5-foot-7 forward, is not only the youngest player on the Earthquakes roster, but also the club\u2019s first ever homegrown signing.\n\nMajor League Soccer\u2019s homegrown player rule, established in 2008, allows teams to sign local players who ascend through the ranks of their development academies, to first team rosters. The Homegrown Player program, which has resulted in more than 75 signings in MLS, \u201cmotivates clubs to invest and sign local players,\u201d said Earthquakes President David Kaval. \u201cIt has been very effective at creating opportunities for young American players.\u201d San Jose was the last MLS franchise to sign a homegrown player.\n\nBut Thompson\u2019s decision to leave school early to sign with the Earthquakes was not easy.\n\nThompson was raised with two older brothers, Tyler and Tanner, and younger sister, Tatum, in Loomis, Calif., in Placer County. Growing up, soccer brought the family together.\n\n\u201cSoccer kept our family pretty close. With two brothers, all of us just a year apart from each other, it bonded us together,\u201d Thompson said.\n\nStarting at age four, Thompson learned the game from his father, Gregg. In his own playing days, Gregg scored the winning free kick against Duke in 1982 that earned Indiana University its first soccer national championship. He also played for the U.S. in the 1984 Summer Olympics.\n\nOne of the first lessons Thompson learned from his father was competitiveness \u2014 the drive to win. But even Thompson admits this competitive spirit sometimes got out of hand. At 10, he joined 11-year-old Tanner\u2019s team, coached by their father.\n\n\u201cTanner and I had a competitive relationship,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cAt practice my dad would always have to separate us and sometimes he would even kick us out of practice because we would get too heated.\u201d\n\nBy ages 16 and 17, the Thompson brothers had risen through the ranks of their local Sacramento club, the California Development Academy. With Tommy playing forward and Tanner supplying the assists from central midfield, they developed a special chemistry and connection on the field.\n\nThen, one day, in August of 2012, their CDA team faced the Earthquakes\u2019 youth academy. Due to scheduling conflicts, the brothers arrived at halftime, but a half was all Earthquakes\u2019 technical director Chris Leach needed to realize the talent and potential of the duo.\n\n\u201cHe (Chris Leach) approached me right after the game,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cI didn\u2019t even know who he was at first. He introduced himself and was real complimentary on how I played. Then he invited me to come train with the first team.\u201d\n\nThompson trained with the Earthquakes\u2019 first team and traveled with the development academy. \u201cI really took a liking to the club and felt a connection right away.\u201d The homegrown link, the connection to a club\u2019s youth system that would allow him to sign professionally at any time, was sealed.\n\nBut what Thompson was thinking about was how to continue playing with Tanner. \u201cTanner and I always planned to go to college together,\u201d Thompson said.\n\n\u201cBy the end of sophomore year, we knew we were going to go together wherever it was,\u201d Tanner recalled.\n\nThat plan became a reality when Indiana University, their father\u2019s alma mater, saw Tommy and Tanner link up at a tournament in Dallas.\n\n\u201cIndiana recruited us almost as a package deal,\u201d said Thompson. \u201cWe committed together. I was a [high school] sophomore and Tanner was a junior.\u201d\n\nThe excitement of teaming up for Indiana University led both Thompson brothers to leave high school early. Tanner graduated a half year early and convinced his younger brother to graduate a full year early.\n\n\u201cThe idea was to play with each other as much as possible and as soon as possible,\u201d said Thompson, who led his Indiana team with five goals and three assists in 16 games, and was named Big-10 Conference Freshman of the Year. \u201cIt was a little bit of a scare for my parents. They didn\u2019t want me to rush through life. But they saw how much I wanted to team up with Tanner.\u201d\n\nThe connection between the Thompson brothers was on display during the 2013-2014 season for the Hoosiers. In a game on Oct. 11 at Wisconsin, Thompson scored two goals off assists from his older brother.\n\n\u201cTanner got the ball at center midfield and I made the looping run that I always did growing up with him,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t even have to look back. I knew the ball was coming. He played the ball he\u2019d played a million times before. I was through and put it away.\u201d\n\nIndiana\u2019s national tournament run ended in the first round at Akron. When the final whistle blew in that 3-2 loss, Thompson would not have guessed it would be his last game playing with Tanner in the red and white. \u201cI had no idea that I would be leaving,\u201d Thompson said.\n\nAfter the season, Thompson got the call from the Earthquakes. They wanted to sign him as their first homegrown player in history after just one semester of college. But that would mean leaving Tanner \u2014 his brother, his teammate and the one he promised to play with as long as possible.\n\n\u201cTanner and I got closer than we had ever been before at IU. We lived together and played together,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cThat\u2019s what made the decision difficult.\u201d\n\nThe whole family weighed the pros and cons: risk of injury, personal development and how it would be socially as a teenage professional soccer player surrounded by grown men with families.\n\n\u201cTanner knew this was a huge opportunity. He didn\u2019t hesitate to encourage me to make my dream a reality,\u201d Thompson said.\n\n\u201cWe always planned on playing together,\u201d Tanner said. \u201cBut once he got the offer, I realized he had to go. We both knew that we would never hold each other back.\u201d\n\nAfter weeks of negotiation, the deal was done. Thompson was a professional soccer player, the Earthquakes\u2019 first homegrown signing.\n\nIt remains to be seen how Thompson will fit into the Earthquakes\u2019 lineup this season. As a 5-foot-7 forward, Thompson breaks the mold of San Jose\u2019s tall, aerially dominate forward line. \u201cThompson is a technically sound, versatile attacking player,\u201d Earthquakes President David Kaval said. He is quick, creative on the dribble and makes intelligent attacking runs. Currently making his way back from injury, Thompson hopes to make an impact in 2014.\n\nTanner and Thompson still talk all the time. However, now they aren\u2019t separated by a couch in their apartment, but by 2,200 miles, from the limestone buildings of Indiana University to a disheveled white bed at San Jose\u2019s Homewood Suites.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Austin Meyer,homegrown player,homegrown player program,Indiana University,major league soccer,MLS,professional soccer,professional sports,San Jose Earthquakes,soccer,Sports,Tanner Thompson,Tommy Thompson,Culture & Features,Features,Frontpage Featured", "description": "Growing up, soccer brought the Thompson family together.
