The agency asked Congress for close to $2 billion more for operations than last year\u2014a 16 percent increase.\n\nThe billions of dollars will help the agency bolster its staff by adding more than 9,280 full-time employees. The proposed jump in employment at the IRS is an 11 percent increase from 2015.\n\nTo enforce the 46 new tax provisions of the Affordable Care Act specifically, the IRS asked for $67 million. That will cover 483 new employees related to Obamacare\u2019s implementation.\n\n\u201cAs the tax law changes, the IRS must implement programs to ensure that taxpayers understand the new laws, and that the IRS can address noncompliance,\u201d the agency\u2019s budget proposal states.\n\nIn addition, the agency requested $301.5 million to hire close to 3,000 additional staff to assist taxpayers calling into the agency with questions. The IRS said it needs to staff to address the \u201cincreased demand\u201d for assistance resulting from Obamacare\u2019s implementation and managing taxpayer submissions relating to the health care law.\n\n>>> A Quick Guide to Obama\u2019s New Budget\n\nThough Obamacare went into effect in October 2013, this tax filing season is the first in which consumers are required to report whether they had health insurance in 2014. Those who did not have coverage\u2014close to 6 million Americans, according to the government\u2019s own projections\u2014are required to pay a penalty of either $95 or 1 percent of their income.\n\nMeanwhile, consumers who received subsidies available under the Affordable Care Act may have to \u201creconcile\u201d their tax credits. Those who received a subsidy last year will be forced to return some money, as any increase in income could mean they received more in tax credits than they were entitled to.\n\nEd Haislmaier, a health policy expert at The Heritage Foundation, told The Daily Signal the rules for calculating tax credits available under Obamacare are a major design flaw of the law.\n\nHaislmaier noted that any tax credit payment made during the year by the IRS to an insurer must be reconciled on the enrollee\u2019s tax form, which is two pages and 36 lines. That form, he said, is included with the consumers\u2019 federal income tax return.\n\nTo remedy potential changes to and the delivery of tax credits, the IRS requested more than $305.6 million, or 818 new employees, to implement technology changes.\n\nMeanwhile, the Department of Health and Human Services announced a partnership with close to a dozen nonprofits and tax-preparation companies, including H&R Block and Jackson Hewitt, to assist with those who are confused about how Obamacare impacts their tax filings.\n\nAccording to HHS, the government\u2019s collaboration with the private sector aims to \u201censure that the public understands how health care and their taxes intersect.\u201d\n\n>>> Obama\u2019s Budget Hikes Taxes by $1.6 Trillion", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Internal Revenue Service is requesting a $2 billion boost to its budget and 9,000 new employees as it prepares to enforce Obamacare\u2019s tax provisions.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The Internal Revenue Service is requesting a $2 billion boost to its budget and 9,000 new employees as it prepares to enforce Obamacare\u2019s tax provisions.", "title": "IRS Seeks 9,000 New Employees as It Prepares to Enforce Obamacare", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/sipaphotosfour6866941.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-02-04T22:05:27+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/18PbgrO"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The Internal Revenue Service is requesting a $2 billion boost to its budget and 9,000 new employees as it prepares to enforce Obamacare\u2019s tax provisions.", "creator": "@dailysignal", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/sipaphotosfour6866941.jpg"}, "title": "IRS Seeks 9,000 New Employees as It Prepares to Enforce Obamacare", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Health Care", "tag": "obamacare", "published_time": "2015-02-05T03:01:28+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-02-04T22:05:27+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Internal Revenue Service, Obamacare, Department of Health and Human Services, immigration executive action, Affordable Care Act, H&R Block, Jackson Hewitt"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf0d3\"", "article_summary": "To enforce the 46 new tax provisions of the Affordable Care Act specifically, the IRS asked for $67 million.\nTo remedy potential changes to and the delivery of tax credits, the IRS requested more than $305.6 million, or 818 new employees, to implement technology changes.\nMeanwhile, consumers who received subsidies available under the Affordable Care Act may have to \u201creconcile\u201d their tax credits.\nThe billions of dollars will help the agency bolster its staff by adding more than 9,280 full-time employees.\nAs millions of Americans brace for tax season, the Internal Revenue Service is requesting a $2 billion boost to its budget and 9,000 new employees as it prepares to enforce Obamacare\u2019s tax provisions."}
