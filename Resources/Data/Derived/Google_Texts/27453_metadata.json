Al Melvin (R-District 11) and former Republican State Sen. Frank Antenori for a meet-and-greet with voters.\n\nMelvin said he supported Ducey\u2019s conservative credentials in the race for governor. Melvin was previously in the running for the Republican nomination for governor before dropping out and endorsing Ducey.\n\n\u201cI believe he\u2019s got the leadership, the vision and the integrity to keep our state red and keep it as far away from blue or purple as we can make it,\u201d Melvin said.\n\nBy Ethan McSweeney / Arizona Summer Wildcat\n\nDoug Ducey, Arizona state treasurer, speaks with voters at a meet and greet at Hotrods Old Vail. Ducey is running for Arizona governor in a crowded Republican primary field.\n\nDucey spoke with those in attendance and responded to their questions on topics from immigration to the Affordable Care Act to lay out his positions. He also spoke of his qualifications with his history of work in the private sector and building up Cold Stone Creamery.\n\n\u201cI built a company, now I want to shrink a government and grow an economy,\u201d he said.\n\nDucey said he wants to get rid of unnecessary taxes and regulations and to ultimately eliminate the state income tax.\n\nHe also focused on immigration and border issues and said President Barack Obama has failed Arizona in his duty to protect the southern border, calling it a national security issue as well as a criminal one.\n\n\u201cI believe it\u2019s the first job of our federal government to protect its citizens,\u201d Ducey said.\n\n\u201cOur Tucson sector is wide open and unprotected.\u201d\n\nDucey touted his recent endorsement from Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio,who is known for his tough stance on illegal immigration. He has also been endorsed by Texas Republican Sen. Ted Cruz and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker.\n\nDucey also addressed concerns over rising tuition costs at the state\u2019s public universities. He praised the three state universities \u2013 the UA, Arizona State University and Northern Arizona University \u2013 but added that Arizona has less choice than other states when it comes to higher education.\n\n\u201cI want to make sure we get these costs under control so these kids have some idea what their budget will be for four or five years as they get their education,\u201d he said. \u201cI think there\u2019s a way we can do that from state government to lock in those costs.\u201d\n\nDucey later responded to criticism he has received on the campaign trail in recent days regarding the sale of Cold Stone Creamery and his failure to appear at a candidate forum at Pima Community College \u2013 West Campus on July 30.\n\nDucey said he had a conflict and could not attend the debate. He added that he has been in Pima County more than any other candidate during the campaign with an average of twice a month.\n\nScott Smith, mayor of Mesa and a Republican gubernatorial opponent, called out Ducey at the July 30 debate for not answering questions over Cold Stone Creamery and not appearing with the other candidates.\n\nAntenori said Ducey\u2019s opponents were trying to spread rumors about the candidate and said they were trying to buy the governor\u2019s seat.\n\n\u201cThey want to buy a governor,\u201d he said. \u201cThey want to own the ninth floor [of the Arizona Capitol building] and the last thing you want is to allow one of those folks to get into the ninth floor.\u201d\n\nDucey is running close in the polls with former GoDaddy executive Christine Jones in a crowded Republican primary field. The primary election is set for Aug. 26 and early voting is underway to see who will face likely Democratic nominee Fred DuVal.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.wildcat.arizona.edu/article/2014/08/ducey-campaign-swings-through-southern-arizona", "image": "http://d1kuv9frcfm3m7.cloudfront.net/20150818Xkx8qk2H8x/dist/images/fb-hidden-icon.png", "type": "article", "title": "Ducey campaign swings through Southern Arizona"}, "twitter": {"site": "@dailywildcat", "card": "summary"}, "generator": "Gryphon 20160217001 (Foundry 6.1-20150615001)", "viewport": "width=device-width", "description": "The Daily Wildcat is where you can find Arizona University\u2019s campus news, Wildcat sports coverage, features, opinions and breaking news for Tucson, Arizona."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd7f67\"", "article_summary": "Ducey campaign swings through Southern ArizonaBy Ethan McSweeney | Published 08/06/14 9:40am | Updated 08/06/14 9:45amRepublican gubernatorial candidate Doug Ducey toured through Southern Arizona on Tuesday as the campaign for the Republican nomination for Arizona governor enters its final weeks.\nBy Ethan McSweeney / Arizona Summer WildcatDoug Ducey, Arizona state treasurer, speaks with voters at a meet and greet at Hotrods Old Vail.\nHe praised the three state universities \u2013 the UA, Arizona State University and Northern Arizona University \u2013 but added that Arizona has less choice than other states when it comes to higher education.\nDucey is running for Arizona governor in a crowded Republican primary field.\nHe has also been endorsed by Texas Republican Sen.
