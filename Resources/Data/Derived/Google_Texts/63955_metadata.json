Her partner, also without weapons, could do nothing to stop the gunman.\n\nAnother was a first responder with a service gun, rushing to the Charlie Hebdo offices where a pair of masked men with high-powered weapons had opened fire on an editorial meeting. Among their primary targets: the armed police bodyguard inside the room.\n\nWith the deaths of the three French officers during three days of terror in the Paris region and the suggestion of a plot in Belgium to kill police, European law enforcement agencies are rethinking how \u2014 and how many \u2014 police should be armed.\n\nPHOTOS: To counter terror, Europe's police reconsider their arms\n\nScotland Yard said Sunday it was increasing the deployment of officers allowed to carry firearms in Britain, where many cling to the image of the unarmed \u201cbobby.\u201d In Belgium, where officials say a terror network was plotting to attack police, officers are again permitted to take their service weapons home.\n\nOn Monday, French law enforcement officials demanding heavier weapons, protective gear and a bolstered intelligence apparatus met with top officials from the Interior Ministry. An official with the ministry, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss ongoing talks, said automatic weapons and heavier bulletproof vests were on the table.\n\nAmong the most horrific images from the Paris attacks was the death of police officer Ahmed Merabet, who can be seen on eyewitness video lying wounded on the pavement as a gunman approaches and fires a final bullet into his head. Merabet, who is seen alone on the street, had a service gun and a bullet proof vest, said Michel Thooris, of the France Police labor union.\n\n\u201cBut he did not come with the backup he needed, and the psychology to face a paramilitary assault,\u201d Thooris said. \u201cWe were not prepared in terms of equipment or mind-set for this kind of operation.\u201d\n\nOne of the attackers, Amedy Coulibaly, said in a posthumous video that his plan all along was to attack police.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want necessarily the arms that American police have. We need weapons that can respond,\u201d said Philippe Capon of French police union UNSA.\n\nAmong those weapons, he added, are modernized criminal databases, because the current databases are out of date, and firewalled between different law enforcement branches. \u201cThe databases are not interactive. They are not accessible to all. They are not up to date,\u201d he said.\n\nUnlike their British counterparts, French national police are armed although their municipal counterparts tend to be weaponless. But Thooris said they are not permitted to have their service weapons while off duty, raising the possibility that they could be targeted when vulnerable or unable to help if they stumble across crime afterhours.\n\nBecause of increasing unease and last week\u2019s anti-terror raids, police in Belgium are again allowed to carry weapons home rather than put their handguns and munition in specialized lockers.\n\n\u201cThe conditions we have now are clearly exceptional,\u201d said Fons Bastiaenssens, a police spokesman in Antwerp, where there are many potential targets, especially in the Jewish quarter.\n\nIn addition, firearms suddenly became far more visible, with some police carrying heavier weaponry as they guard sensitive buildings and police offices, and paratroopers in the streets of the major cities.\n\nIn Britain, the overall threat level is \u201csevere\u201d - meaning intelligence and police officials have evidence that a terrorist attack is highly likely. The threat to police officers themselves is judged to be very high after the Paris attacks as well as the recent disruption of a reported Islamist extremist plot to attack individual police officers in west London.\n\nIn response, the Metropolitan Police said Sunday it is bolstering the deployment of specialist firearms officers who are authorized to carry weapons. The force, also known as Scotland Yard, declined to provide details, and senior police officials say there is no need for a wholesale policy shift that would arm all police.\n\nBut Mark Rowley, chief of the counter-terror operation, said the \u201coverall security posture\u201d of the police is being reviewed in light of the Paris attacks.\n\nIn Norway, where far-right fanatic Anders Behring Breivik killed 69 people in a shooting spree at a political youth camp and eight others by bombing a government office, police are increasingly agitating for weapons.\n\n\u201cWe have seen from the declarations of Coulibaly and also from what happened in Belgium that police can be primary targets for terrorist groups,\u201d said Nicolas Comte, of the SGP police union in France. \u201cWe have to give the means to police services, and notably intelligence, to fight this new form of terrorism.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Jamey Keaten and Milos Krivokapic in Paris; Raf Casert in Brussels; Greg Katz in London; and Jan Olsen in Copenhagen contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"description": "With the deaths of the three French officers during three days of terror in the Paris region and the suggestion of a plot in Belgium to kill police, European law enforcement agencies are rethinking how \u2014 and how many \u2014 police should be armed.", "Author": "Lori Hinnant", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "With the deaths of the three French officers during three days of terror in the Paris region and the suggestion of a plot in Belgium to kill police, European law enforcement agencies are rethinking how \u2014 and how many \u2014 police should be armed.", "title": "To counter terror, Europe\u2019s police reconsider their arms", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jan/19/to-counter-terror-europes-police-reconsider-their-/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/01/19/783b22a91110aa036b0f6a7067006ed0.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/01/19/783b22a91110aa036b0f6a7067006ed0.jpg", "title": "To counter terror, Europe\u2019s police reconsider their arms", "description": "With the deaths of the three French officers during three days of terror in the Paris region and the suggestion of a plot in Belgium to kill police, European law enforcement agencies are rethinking ho", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "news_keywords": "War Conflict, Paris, Belgium, Scotland Yard, Michel Thooris"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd38d\"", "article_summary": "PARIS (AP) \u2014 One was a young policewoman, unarmed on the outskirts of Paris and felled by an assault rifle.\nOn Monday, French law enforcement officials demanding heavier weapons, protective gear and a bolstered intelligence apparatus met with top officials from the Interior Ministry.\nPHOTOS: To counter terror, Europe's police reconsider their armsScotland Yard said Sunday it was increasing the deployment of officers allowed to carry firearms in Britain, where many cling to the image of the unarmed \u201cbobby.\u201d In Belgium, where officials say a terror network was plotting to attack police, officers are again permitted to take their service weapons home.\n\u201cBut he did not come with the backup he needed, and the psychology to face a paramilitary assault,\u201d Thooris said.\nIn response, the Metropolitan Police said Sunday it is bolstering the deployment of specialist firearms officers who are authorized to carry weapons."}
