â€” Police said Friday that bad weather, excessive speed and tire condition were all factors in a fiery crash in Rocky Mount a week ago that killed three people.

Jason Javon Britt, 29, Dennis Ray Battle Jr., 21, and Kyol Germane Allen, 27, were killed when the car Britt was driving slammed into a brick building at the intersection of South Grace and Chester streets on May 16 and burst into flames.

All three were musicians and the sons of ministers, according to friends and family.
