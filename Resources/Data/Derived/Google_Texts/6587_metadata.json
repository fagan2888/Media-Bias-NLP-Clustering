The DACA program was not impacted by this.\n\nA federal appeals court is currently deciding whether to allow the 2014 program to move forward. The case is expected to rise to the Supreme Court.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Obama administration is rushing to comply with a federal court order, dispersing officials to seize work permits granted to illegal immigrants.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The Obama administration is rushing to comply with a federal court order, dispersing officials to seize work permits granted to illegal immigrants.", "title": "DHS to Seize Work Permits From Illegal Immigrants", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150717_ObamaImmigration_Johnson.jpg", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1GqWS1D"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The Obama administration is rushing to comply with a federal court order, dispersing officials to seize work permits granted to illegal immigrants.", "creator": "@dailysignal", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150717_ObamaImmigration_Johnson.jpg"}, "title": "DHS to Seize Work Permits From Illegal Immigrants", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Society", "tag": "immigration", "published_time": "2015-07-17T14:46:11+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Andrew Hanen, Jeh Johnson, illegal immigration"}, "article_summary": "The Obama administration is rushing to comply with a federal court order, dispersing officials throughout the U.S. to personally seize more than 2,000 work permits that were granted to illegal immigrants under the president\u2019s executive actions.\nCitizenship and Immigration Services, an agency under Homeland Security, told Politico that immigration officials have collected about 900 of the nearly 2,500 three-year permits.\nObama\u2019s 2014 executive action also shields certain parents of already protected children from deportation.\nIn February, Hanen issued an injunction against Obama\u2019s 2014 executive action.\nHanen demanded the officials explain why they should not be held in contempt for violating the court\u2019s February injunction barring a program granting extended work permits under President Obama\u2019s executive actions."}
