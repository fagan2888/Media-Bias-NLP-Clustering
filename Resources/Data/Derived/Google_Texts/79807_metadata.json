Fortunately, we don\u2019t need the income from the IRA to support our living expenses. And because I have a $176,000 tax-loss carryforward from a business that went bust a decade ago, my broker suggested that I convert my traditional IRA to a Roth IRA and use the carryforward to pay the taxes. If I did that, I would make the beneficiaries our grandkids, who could enjoy the continued stock growth and stretch the Roth payments over their much-longer lifetimes. Because their parents are \u201cfinancial stupids\u201d (your words), I need to change the investment mix to some Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 index funds and several no-load mutual funds. I would appreciate your recommendations.\n\n\u2014 B.R., Erie, Pa.\n\nDear B.R.: Fire that brokster, who is a blithering, brain-dead idiot and dangerous to your wealth. He should have \u201cstupidity\u201d branded on his forehead in large letters. You can\u2019t use a tax-loss carryforward to pay those taxes yet.\n\nLeaving a Roth IRA for your grandkids to grow tax-free over your lifetime and theirs is an expialidocious idea. Many folks have Roth IRAs because, unlike the case with traditional IRAs, they\u2019re not required to take distributions at age 70\u00bd. As of today, a Roth IRA can still remain untouched throughout your lifetime, even if you live to be older than Methuselah, and the income is tax-free. Today, those who inherit an IRA (Roth or traditional) can stretch those payments over their lifetime. This permits most of an inherited Roth to continue growing tax-free for your grandkids.\n\nBut that old gray mare ain\u2019t what she used to be, and that old Roth IRA we believed to be sacrosanct and immune to change might soon be corrupted by our government\u2019s insatiable greed for money. There are two proposals in the 2015 budget that are likely to be passed and might toss a grenade into many estate plans.\n\n1) Next year, all Roth owners might be required to take distributions at age 70\u00bd. So if you\u2019re moderately healthy with a normal life span, your Roth might be significantly depleted when you pass away.\n\n2) The Obama administration wants to eliminate the ability of nonspousal IRA beneficiaries to stretch their distributions. This means that the assets of nonspousal beneficiaries of inherited IRAs must be fully distributed within five years of the owner\u2019s passing. Certain beneficiaries would be exempt, but the language identifying their status (the specifics are silent concerning children, grandchildren or other family members) is unclear. Seeing as there may be no \u201cstretch\u201d available, it doesn\u2019t make sense to convert to a Roth and pay the taxes for 2014, because the deferral rate when you die could be limited to five years.\n\nOther changes coming\n\nBut consider yourself lucky, because other changes are a-comin\u2019 to finance the numerous new government initiatives, including the Affordable Care Act. Though the income from your Roth is currently not taxable, Congress might impose some kind of teensy excise tax on Roth distributions beginning in 2016.\n\nSome of us may recall when Hillary Clinton, in 1994, tried to pass her plan for universal health care. It was suggested then that the government could pay for a large portion of the costs by taxing this country\u2019s greatest and last nontaxed asset: the American retirement plan. There were proposals floating between Congress and the White House about taxing an employer\u2019s annual contribution to all retirement plans and taxing, at a reduced rate, the annual investment gains in our retirement plans.\n\nThis Golconda is a treasure-trove of untapped wealth and could be a superb source of new tax revenues for our Congress. The combined value of America\u2019s qualified retirement accounts at the end of 2013 \u2014 IRAs, pensions, 401(k) plans, defined-benefit plans, federal and state plans, and annuities \u2014 was more than $22 trillion. This is an alluring stash that Congress won\u2019t be able to resist as it strives to pay for our growing social programs. (Remember that Social Security income was not taxable until 1984.) And most members of Congress would prefer to tax our retirement plans as an alternative to a value-added tax that\u2019s been proposed by their colleagues.\n\nMalcolm Berko addresses questions about stocks.
