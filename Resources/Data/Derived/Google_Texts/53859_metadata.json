Such is the case with the 1,532-page, $1.1 trillion Consolidated Appropriations Act, as the lumbering bill that will fund federal agencies and assorted programs through September 30 has been christened. Though it has not yet begun to smell, the big bill is already offending those of a more frugal mindset. Citizens Against Government Waste deems the legislation objectionable because it breaks the sequester budget caps. And there are earmarks which meet the watchdog group\u2019s \u201clongstanding, seven-point criteria for pork-barrel spending.\u201d Among them:\n\n$112.9 million for the Rural Utilities Service; $90 million for continued upgrade of M1 Abrams; $60 million for alternative energy research; $341 million for the Army Corps of Engineers; $4 million for aquatic plant control; $45.1 million for high-intensity drug trafficking areas programs; $98 million for the National Domestic Preparedness Consortium; $25 million for the National Predisaster Mitigation Fund; $9.3 million for Heritage Partnership Programs through the National Park Service; and $14.4 million for Rural Hospital Flexibility Grants.\n\nThe group acknowledges that there are a few provisions that would increase transparency and eliminate wasteful spending \u2014 a reduction of $49 million for the federal biofuels program, for instance \u2014 but earmarks and other wasteful spending \u201cfar outweigh any positive aspects.\u201d\n\nAPPROPRIATIONS OFFENSE CONTINUES\n\nFiscal conservatives and grassroots folk are already holding their noses over the aforementioned legislation, however.\n\n\u201cWe have seen this infuriating shell game of increased spending now, and promised cuts later \u2014 a game of deception. And it\u2019s why people are so fed up with Washington,\u201d declares Brent Bozell, chairman ForAmerica, who is especially critical of \u201cgo-along Republicans\u201d for creating a divide between GOP leadership and the party rank-and-file.\n\n\u201cAll the programs the GOP leadership has repeatedly promised to end \u2014 Obamacare, taxpayer funding of Planned Parenthood, public broadcasting and others \u2014 are still being funded. So what\u2019s the difference between John Boehner and Nancy Pelosi and Mitch McConnell and Harry Reid? Answer: The Democratic leadership honors its promises. Republican leaders have abandoned theirs,\u201d Mr. Bozell says.\n\n\u201cIn sum, House leaders have written a sequester-scrapping spending bill in secret, given members and the public barely a day to read it, and shut down all amendments. These are Pelosi tactics, not the \u2018transparent\u2019 government and \u2018regular order\u2019 Republicans promised,\u201d observes Matt Kibbe, president of FreedomWorks, who is asking the 6 million members of the group to contact their local lawmakers and protest.\n\n\u201cThis proposal essentially kicks the can down the road. Where is the leadership in Washington? Until long-term entitlements are reformed, taxpayers will be an economic hiccup away from being burdened with massively higher taxes,\u201d notes John Nothdurft, director of government relations at the Heartland Institute, a free market think tank.\n\nHUCKABEE\u2019S RINO RANT\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the Republican Party\u2019s biggest obstacle in this year\u2019s elections? Republicans! With Benghazi, Obamacare, NSA spying, al Qaeda and the still-staggering economy, 2014 should be a record year for the GOP. But they risk disaster if they let the primaries be hijacked by ad campaigns by groups that don\u2019t target Democrats, but fellow Republicans who aren\u2019t \u2018pure\u2019 enough. And one term that I\u2019d like to see outlawed from the vernacular of the party is \u2018RINO.\u2019 It stands for \u2018Republicans in name only,\u2019 and it\u2019s a pejorative term that questions the authenticity and orthodoxy of someone\u2019s party purity. I\u2019ve been called that myself, even though I fought in the trenches of Republican politics for over two decades. Even so, I would never pretend that I\u2019m lord over determining who the real Republicans are.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Mike Huckabee, in a Facebook post on Tuesday.\n\nSANTORUM FINDS A NEW DEMOGRAPHIC\n\n\u201cBlue Collar Conservatives\u201d\n\n\u2014 New book by Rick Santorum from Regnery Publishing, due out in April\n\n\u2018COMMON-SENSE PRO-LIFE LEGISLATION\u2019\n\nThe aforementioned Mr. Santorum will be a key figure at the 41st annual March for Life along the National Mall one week from Wednesday. The event is also accompanied by a raft of new pro-life information to engage an oft-ambivalent press and public.\n\nThere is Americans United for Life\u2019s new \u201cLife List,\u201d ranking all 50 states based on how well each protects life through law. For the fifth year in a row, Louisiana is in first place, followed by Oklahoma, Arkansas, Arizona, Pennsylvania and Texas.\n\nAnd for the 5th year in a row, Washington state ranked as the worst state for life for failing to protect women from an unmonitored and underregulated abortion industry, followed by California, Vermont, New York and Connecticut.\n\n\u201cReal pro-life momentum is reshaping the country as legislators craft protections for both mother and child, the victims of an avaricious abortion industry,\u201d said Charmaine Yoest, president of the nonprofit law and policy organization.\n\n\u201cCommon-sense pro-life legislation saves lives and has broad public support in light of what we\u2019re learning about the health risks of abortion for women,\u201d Mrs. Yoest adds.\n\nThe Family Research Council, meanwhile, is releasing a significant analysis of the \u201cdemographics of abortion\u201d on Wednesday. The findings show that the number of American women who actually have had an abortion is significantly less than previously thought, according to Patrick Fagan, director of the organization\u2019s Marriage and Religion Research Institute.\n\nRep. Christopher H. Smith, New Jersey Republican and co-chairman of the House Pro-Life Caucus, also will be on hand to discuss the conclusions. The title of it all: \u201cAbortion Myths and Facts: New Research Challenges Abortion Advocates\u2019 Claims.\u201d See their conversation live at 12 p.m. ET, videocast here: Frc.org\n\nPARTY LIKE A PATRIOT\n\nOn the radar: the \u201cRed, White & Blue Gala\u201d on Feb. 5 at a glittering old hotel a few blocks north of the White House. It is refreshingly billed as a \u201ccelebration of principles\u201d by organizers at \u2014 but of course \u2014 the American Principles Project, a nonprofit that celebrates \u201cthe dignity of the person as the basis of the founding principles of the United States.\u201d\n\nThe keynote speaker for the reception and dinner is none other than Sen. Rand Paul, Kentucky Republican; the master of ceremony is RedState.com founder Erick Erickson. And this is a celebration: Guests are encouraged to wear swank cocktail attire \u2014 but in hues of red, white or blue.\n\nPOLL DU JOUR\n\n\u2022 64 percent of New Jersey residents say they believe Gov.
