A White House official said earlier this week that Yellen was the leading candidate.\n\nThe third source said the calls were mostly at the staff level, although some senators may have been contacted directly.\n\nObama, who leaves on a week-long tour of Asia on October 6, is expected to announce his decision in the coming weeks.\n\nYellen, who is seen as one of the most dovish Fed officials, is likely to enjoy solid backing from Democrats, but could draw some fire from Republicans worried that the central bank's aggressive efforts to spur stronger economic growth could fuel inflation or asset bubbles.\n\nDemocrats control the Senate 54-46, but any nomination is likely to need to secure 60 votes to overcome procedural hurdles. Republicans have not indicated whether they might seek to block a Yellen nomination.\n\nYellen became the front runner after former Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers withdrew from the race on Sunday in the face of opposition from liberal Democrats.\n\nObama was felt to favor his selection. But Summers' record of advocacy for financial deregulation, as well as remarks in the past deemed as sexist, sparked a backlash among some Democrats on the banking panel that would need to decide whether to send any nomination to the full Senate for approval.\n\nObama said last month that Summers and Yellen were both being considered for the job, the most powerful economic office in the nation, as was former Fed vice chair Donald Kohn.\n\nOne of the senate aides said Kohn's name had not come up in the conversations with the White House.\n\n(Writing by Alister Bull; Editing by Tim
