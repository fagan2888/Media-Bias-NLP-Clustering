Kay Hagan for her support of Obamacare.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re now finding out that ObamaCare could cause premiums to skyrocket by up to 60 percent over the next few years, a painful reminder of how Kay Hagan deliberately misled North Carolinians with false promises that ObamaCare would control costs and make healthcare more affordable,\u201d said Tillis spokesman Daniel Keylin.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nEarlier in the week, the Carolina Journal reported on a panel discussion about Obamacare in which an insurance agent said that Coventry Health Care of the Carolinas CEO Tracy Baker told his organization that premiums will rise.\n\n\u201cHe can see in 2016 this thing shooting up anywhere from 30 to 60 percent in costs\u201d insurance agent Rufus Langley said, according to the Carolina Journal.\n\nLangley added that people will be also receiving termination notices, Carolina Journal reported:\n\n\u201cTermination letters are going out this month,\u201d he said. \u201cA fair amount [of consumers] didn\u2019t qualify\u201d for coverage, though he had no specific numbers. \u201cThere will be people who are going to be flushed out, and not eligible for subsidies, because they didn\u2019t provide the right information, or they didn\u2019t verify whether or not they were U.S. citizens,\u201d Langley said.\n\nThe Tillis campaign recalled in a release how Hagan sold Obamacare to North Carolinians and slammed her for her vote in favor of the law.\n\n\u201cWhen selling ObamaCare to North Carolinians, Kay Hagan repeated PolitiFact\u2019s \u2018Lie of the Year\u2019 no fewer than 24 times by promising that people who like their plans could keep them,\u201d the Tillis campaign wrote in a release. \u201cHagan at one point even declared it was the \u2018fundamental promise\u2019 of the President\u2019s bill. Last fall, over 473,000 North Carolinians received cancellation notices.\u201d\n\nHagan and Tillis are engaged in a tight race for the U.S. Senate. The most recent Real Clear Politics Average has Hagan leading Tillis by 4.5 percentage points.\n\n\u201cObamaCare is hurting middle-class families who now won\u2019t be able to pay their bills, yet Kay Hagan says she would still vote for ObamaCare again if given the chance,\u201d Keylin added. \u201cThom Tillis is the only candidate in this race who will work towards healthcare reform that actually controls costs and increases healthcare options for North Carolinians.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "North Carolina: Thom Tillis Campaign Attacks Kay Hagan for Obamacare Support", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "North Carolina: Thom Tillis Campaign Attacks Kay Hagan for Obamacare Support", "title": "North Carolina: Thom Tillis Campaign Attacks Kay Hagan for Obamacare Support - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Big-Government/2014/09/25/Kay-Hagan-png.png", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2014/09/25/tillis-campaign-attacks-hagan-for-obamacare-support-amid-report-premiums-to-rise-up-to-60-percent-in-nc/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "North Carolina: Thom Tillis Campaign Attacks Kay Hagan for Obamacare Support", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Big-Government/2014/09/25/Kay-Hagan-png.png", "title": "North Carolina: Thom Tillis Campaign Attacks Kay Hagan for Obamacare Support - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "app_id": 1243316582352556, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Kay Hagan, Senate,Big Government,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Big Government", "tag": "Senate", "published_time": "2014-09-25T15:47:16-07:00", "categories": "Big Government"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce693\"", "article_summary": "The Tillis campaign recalled in a release how Hagan sold Obamacare to North Carolinians and slammed her for her vote in favor of the law.\nLast fall, over 473,000 North Carolinians received cancellation notices.\u201dHagan and Tillis are engaged in a tight race for the U.S. Senate.\n\u201cWhen selling ObamaCare to North Carolinians, Kay Hagan repeated PolitiFact\u2019s \u2018Lie of the Year\u2019 no fewer than 24 times by promising that people who like their plans could keep them,\u201d the Tillis campaign wrote in a release.\n\u201cObamaCare is hurting middle-class families who now won\u2019t be able to pay their bills, yet Kay Hagan says she would still vote for ObamaCare again if given the chance,\u201d Keylin added.\n\u201cThom Tillis is the only candidate in this race who will work towards healthcare reform that actually controls costs and increases healthcare options for North Carolinians.\u201d"}
