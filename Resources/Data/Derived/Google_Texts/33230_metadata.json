Jason Chaffetz: Mitt Romney will run in 2016 \u2014 and he\u2019ll win\n\nposted at 4:01 pm on July 8, 2014 by Allahpundit\n\nVia Mediaite, I don\u2019t deny that I enjoy trolling the HA faithful with stories about (groan) yet another Romney campaign, but is it trolling or is it news when the rumor du jour\u2019s coming from a Republican congressman? And Chaffetz is no random House member: Romney endorsed him when he first ran for Congress in Utah in 2008 and Chaffetz returned the favor when Romney ran for president in 2011, even though Chaffetz had been the gubernatorial campaign manager for Romney rival Jon Huntsman. He went on to server as a surrogate for Mitt during media hits after some of the primary debates in 2012. If there\u2019s anyone on the Hill who *might* have an inside track into Romney\u2019s thinking, it\u2019s him.\n\nAnd yet \u2026 no one seriously believes Romney\u2019s running, right? In which case, what\u2019s Chaffetz\u2019s angle here? Gotta be one of two things, I think. One: Mitt\u2019s inner circle is worried that Jeb Bush won\u2019t run and that Christie is now too damaged to hold off a conservative in the primaries, so they\u2019re trying to pressure him into reconsidering. Chaffetz\u2019s shpiel here is part of the wider media effort lately by Team Romney to encourage him by showing him that the public might be more receptive to Romney 3.0 than Mitt thinks. Two: Chaffetz knows full well this is BS but he\u2019s pushing it anyway for his own interests, i.e. making sure that Romney\u2019s on his side when he eventually runs for Senate. Chaffetz nearly primaried Orrin Hatch two years ago, remember; ultimately he declined, but Hatch just turned 80 and may well retire when his term is up in 2018. Chaffetz will be just 51 then and eager to fill the vacancy. Utah\u2019s Republican field could be crowded and nasty \u2014 Dan Lilijenquist, Hatch\u2019s last challenger, and even Chaffetz\u2019s old boss Huntsman could be eyeing Hatch\u2019s seat \u2014 so, assuming one of Romney\u2019s own sons doesn\u2019t run, competition for Mitt\u2019s endorsement and fundraising will be stiff. Maybe Chaffetz is just keeping his ducks in a row here.\n\nIncidentally, since we\u2019re on the subject, what would the Romney 3.0 campaign narrative even look like? Mitt, (in)famously, is a creature of reinvention: When he ran for Senate against Ted Kennedy, he was a Massachusetts moderate; when he ran for president in 2008, he was a staunch social conservative; when he ran in 2012, he was an economy-healing technocrat. I assume he\u2019d stick with the last message for 2016, but that\u2019s complicated by the fact that (a) the economy will probably be better than it was in 2012, which bodes ill for a guy whose economic message didn\u2019t work the last time, and (b) Democrats will be running against income inequality, which makes Mr. \u201c47 Percent\u201d uniquely poorly suited to parry their attacks. So what does he run as, then? As a foreign-policy candidate? Apart from 2004, which was sui generis because it followed 9/11, when was the last time someone won the presidency running on foreign policy?\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "Oh my.", "title": "GOP Rep.
