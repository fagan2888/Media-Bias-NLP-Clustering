Record turnout. That doesn't happen by accident, said Clovis, national campaign co-chairman.\n\nTrump is \"tapping into what is going on in this country like no one else has in a long, long time. I haven't seen anything like this since Ronald Reagan.\"\n\nColumnist Peggy Noonan, a former Reagan speechwriter, had a different lament in the Wall Street Journal on Friday. \"I think we are seeing a great political party shatter before our eyes,\" she said.\n\n\"But we are witnessing history. Something important is ending. It is hard to believe what replaces it will be better. No one knows where this goes. The top of the party and the bottom have split.\"\n\n(Reporting by Doina Chiacu and Megan Cassella; Writing by Doina Chiacu; Editing by Bill Trott)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - With U.S.", "title": "Republicans in tailspin, group forms to draft Ryan for U.S. president", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/03/04/Republicans-tailspin-group-forms-draft-Ryan-US-president", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/usa-court-abortion_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/03/04/Republicans-tailspin-group-forms-draft-Ryan-US-president", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/usa-court-abortion_1.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - With U.S.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "The Republican Party may need more than a hero as it grapples with its deepest divisions in decades.\nWhile the anti-Trump movements proliferated, some Republicans have urged party leaders to respect the will of the voters.\n\"That is the quandary I'm trying to avoid the Republican Party having to face,\" Rubio said on CNN on Friday.\nTrump spokesman Sam Clovis seized on that message on Friday, warning on CNN that it was dangerous for Republican leaders to \"call American voters stupid\" because they support Trump.\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - With U.S. Republicans sharply split over a front-runner they cannot unite behind, a new group is trying to push the country's top elected Republican, Paul Ryan, into the White House race."}
