Perhaps if you kept your building in top-notch condition, you would not worry about when they walk into the building like we do.\n\nPottsville\n\n\u2022\n\nThis is for the person from Pottsville calling in about Schuylkill Center receiving advance notice of inspection from the state: I\u2019d like to inform you that you\u2019re totally wrong. You should get your facts straight and not from the local pub.\n\nNew Philadelphia\n\n\u2022\n\nTo the person who thinks we are children: We are adults. Obama has put us in debt every year he has been in office. Obama has had the IRS, NSA and VA scandal. He and Hillary did not send help when it was needed in Benghazi. Watch \u201cThirteen Hours\u201d and you will learn about our government and our people. We are adults.\n\nSaint Clair\n\n\u201cThirteen Hours\u201d is a movie produced for entertainment, not for educational purposes.\n\n\u2022\n\nFYI: Just because you are admitted to a hospital that\u2019s in your network doesn\u2019t mean the doctors that are employed at that hospital are also in network. It just happened to me recently. The doctors were not in network and were not covered. If you\u2019re not going to be admitted to the hospital, you need to check that out if they\u2019re putting you in for observation, your insurance may not cover that. That happened to me as well. You need to check these things out. Insurance is so screwed up since Obamacare, nobody knows what they\u2019re doing. Just be sure to check. Make sure you\u2019re admitted and not just in for observation. Make sure the doctors are also in network, not just the hospital.\n\nPottsville\n\n\u2022\n\nWe have great people in this area. Thank you to the person who found my lost key at Boscov\u2019s. You are a sweetheart.\n\nAshland", "article_metadata": {"description": "Commentary, Pottsville editorials, Schuylkill, Editorials, editors column, op-ed, opinion, Republican Herald editorials", "author": "From Callers", "title": "Thunder/Enlightning, May 3, 2016", "robots": "ACAP allow-index", "DC.creator": "From Callers", "tout": {"article": {"id": "1.2037762"}}, "keywords": "Opinion", "DC.subject": "Opinion", "DC.title": "Thunder/Enlightning, May 3, 2016"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3ae0\"", "article_summary": "Make sure you\u2019re admitted and not just in for observation.\nMake sure the doctors are also in network, not just the hospital.\n\u2022FYI: Just because you are admitted to a hospital that\u2019s in your network doesn\u2019t mean the doctors that are employed at that hospital are also in network.\nPerhaps if you kept your building in top-notch condition, you would not worry about when they walk into the building like we do.\nJust be sure to check."}
