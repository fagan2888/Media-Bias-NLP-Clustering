We have a strong commitment to upholding the First Amendment.\"\n\nTrump and Ben Carson are the only two Republican presidential contenders to receive Secret Service protection, along with Democratic contenders Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders.\n\nCandidates must request the coverage.\n\nWhite House spokesman Josh Earnest on Tuesday acknowledged that the Secret Service has indicated it would \"look at this particular situation.\"\n\n(Reporting by Julia Edwards; Editing by Richard Chang)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Secret Service is investigating an incident at presidential", "title": "Secret Service probing agent, photographer fight at Trump rally", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/03/01/Secret-Service-probing-agent-photographer-fight-Trump-rally", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/usa-election-trump_3.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/03/01/Secret-Service-probing-agent-photographer-fight-Trump-rally", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/usa-election-trump_3.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Secret Service is investigating an incident at presidential", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "White House spokesman Josh Earnest on Tuesday acknowledged that the Secret Service has indicated it would \"look at this particular situation.\"\nThe Secret Service said it would never intervene to quiet protesters or restrict journalists unless there was a public safety matter.\nTrump and Ben Carson are the only two Republican presidential contenders to receive Secret Service protection, along with Democratic contenders Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders.\nIn a statement published in Time, Morris said he had covered the White House for nine years without altercations with the Secret Service.\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Secret Service is investigating an incident at presidential candidate Donald Trump's rally in Radford, Virginia in which an agent shoved a Time magazine photographer to the ground, an agency spokesman said on Tuesday."}
