(BLOOMBERG) — Billionaire Donald Trump sees economic clouds hovering above the U.S. economy. And if it’s going to rain, he wants the precipitation to fall while President Barack Obama is still in the White House.

“Remember the word bubble? You heard it here first,” the Republican presidential front-runner told about 1,200 people at a rally Saturday afternoon in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. “I don’t want to sound rude, but I hope if it explodes, it’s going to be now, rather than two months into another administration.”

With the unemployment rate on the decline, the Federal Reserve on Dec. 16 raised its benchmark interest rate for the first time since 2006, after deciding the U.S. economy is now performing well enough that it could make the move.
