The choices of these teens and 20-somethings can be anything from \u201cFast and Furious 5\u201d or \u201cThe Hunger Games\u201d to the occasional retro pick like \u201cThe Sound of Music.\u201d\n\nIt prompts the question \u201cWhy that movie?\u201d There\u2019s probably more behind the choice than just a favorite star or mind-blowing special effects. Often it\u2019s the context we bring to the theater that makes it a particular kind of experience, good or bad, and says something about us and our lives at a moment in time.\n\nAnswering that potentially personal question is one factor that sets \u201cKeepers\u201d apart from other books extolling Hollywood\u2019s best. Another is its author, film critic and historian Richard Schickel, a keeper himself after a half-century of ruminating about the cinema. For kindred spirits who would rather watch a movie than do pretty much anything else, reading Schickel\u2019s memoir is like paging through a family photo album with a wise and witty elder who tells you what he thinks is going on around a picture\u2019s edges.\n\nUnlike those who point out the films to see before your internal bulb burns out, Schickel doesn\u2019t provide a handy list. He has a story to tell \u2014 his or the movie\u2019s, if not both \u2014 and goes beyond a recap of the plot. He also provides a bit of insight gleaned from having known an actor or filmmaker. Of the enigmatic director Stanley Kubrick, he remarks: \u201cYou never had a bad time with Stanley. You never came away from time spent with him unenlightened.\u201d\n\nMany of Schickel\u2019s keepers will be familiar to seasoned movie fans. After all, there is wide agreement about films like \u201cCitizen Kane,\u201d \u201cDouble Indemnity,\u201d \u201cThe Searchers,\u201d \u201cThe Godfather\u201d and \u201cChinatown.\u201d One of the attractions of \u201cKeepers\u201d is the encouragement to check out less prominent films, for example, writer-director Preston Sturges\u2019 work from the 1940s and foreign films from the 1950s like \u201cThe 400 Blows\u201d and \u201cIkiru.\u201d Schickel makes room on the buffet for low-budget entertainments, too, such as the 1959 Audie Murphy Western \u201cNo Name on the Bullet.\u201d\n\nGoing against the grain of a best-of book, Schickel devotes space to movies he\u2019s not that keen on. Some of those choices are surprising. He prefers Woody Allen\u2019s \u201cZelig\u201d to \u201cAnnie Hall.\u201d\n\nHe isn\u2019t watching \u201cTaxi Driver\u201d again for a notable reason: \u201cIt is perhaps the most terrifying great movie ever.\u201d Relatively few such superlatives are dished out: the masterpiece of Disney\u2019s studio (\u201cPinocchio\u201d); one of the greatest works in the history of popular culture (\u201cKing Kong\u201d); best actor of the Golden Age (Henry Fonda); his own favorite movie star (Errol Flynn); and perhaps his own favorite movie (\u201cFargo\u201d).\n\nThat curious question \u2014 why that movie? \u2014 is one we might ponder for our own cinematic keepers. Maybe the answer lies somewhere near the theme of another one of Schickel\u2019s, Vittorio de Sica\u2019s 1952 film \u201cUmberto D,\u201d about a pensioner who tries to lose a burdensome dog but eventually accepts with joy that the dog is his for life. Schickel surmises, \u201cVery simply, it says, I guess, that we do not choose what or whom we love, that somehow the object of our affection chooses us \u2014 and we reject that choice at our peril.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Book review: \u201cKeepers: The Greatest Films \u2014 and Personal Favorites \u2014 of a Moviegoing Lifetime,\u201d by Richard Schickel", "title": "Book review: \u201cKeepers: The Greatest Films \u2014 and Personal Favorites \u2014 of a Moviegoing Lifetime,\u201d by Richard Schickel", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/06/25/book-review-keepers-the-greatest-films-and-personal-favorites-of-a-moviegoing-lifetime-by-richard-schickel/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "height": 630}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-06-25T18:12:28+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-06-25T18:12:28+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "A theater up the street asks its employees to include the title of a favorite movie on their name tags.\nYou never came away from time spent with him unenlightened.\u201dMany of Schickel\u2019s keepers will be familiar to seasoned movie fans.\nAnother is its author, film critic and historian Richard Schickel, a keeper himself after a half-century of ruminating about the cinema.\nUnlike those who point out the films to see before your internal bulb burns out, Schickel doesn\u2019t provide a handy list.\nAnswering that potentially personal question is one factor that sets \u201cKeepers\u201d apart from other books extolling Hollywood\u2019s best."}
