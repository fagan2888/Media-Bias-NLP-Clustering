State treasurer candidate Betsy Markey’s campaign made an embarrassing mistake on Facebook, claiming she’s the only woman running statewide when Cynthia Coffman is the GOP nominee for attorney general.

Markey, a Democrat, is trying to unseat state Treasurer Walker Stapleton. Campaign spokesman Kyle Miller responded that the error was a “typo” and the post has been updated to say “only Democratic woman.”

But GOP operative Tyler Sandberg, campaign manager for Coffman’s husband, U.S. Rep. Mike Coffman, didn’t want Markey’s campaign left off the hook so easily for forgetting the AG nominee.

“Does Obamacare cover Narcissistic Personality Disorder?” he asked. .

Markey’s campaign in January sent fundraising e-mails from info@markeyforcongress.com, although she’s no longer a congresswoman, having been defeated by Republican Cory Gardner in 2010.

“Just a mistake by a new volunteer,” Markey said, at the time.
