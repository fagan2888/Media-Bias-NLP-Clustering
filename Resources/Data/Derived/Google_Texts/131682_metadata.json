We set fires to create prairies and improve habitat for butterflies; we allow wolves to be killed for the greater good of communities affected by having too many; and we treat rivers with chemicals to kill \u201crough\u201d species, such as carp, so other popular game fish can thrive.\n\nBut, what if attaining that greater good means killing a threatened species?\n\nI was troubled by what happened on the Muskegon River in September, when 32 baby sturgeons were killed during a sea lamprey treatment conducted by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.\n\nThe lampricide TFM \u2014 3-trifluoromethyl-4-nitrophenol \u2014 can kill non-target species, but lake sturgeons are a state-designated threatened species. Extraordinary measures should be undertaken to preserve them. Work to restore them in the Muskegon River has been ongoing since 2006.\n\nDidn\u2019t have to happen\n\nWhat\u2019s troubling is the kill could have been avoided with better communication between state and federal agencies and, perhaps, more flexible treatment scheduling. It appears the kill was the result of bad timing rather than the misapplication of TFM, the standard chemical used to treat lamprey-infested rivers.\n\n\u201cThirty two is the number we found, and there are probably others we haven\u2019t found,\u201d said Kregg Smith, the Michigan Department of Natural Resources biologist who supervises the Muskegon River sturgeon restoration effort. \u201cI don\u2019t think it was a matter of human error. And I know the Fish and Wildlife Service is concerned about it and is working on ways to improve (TFM applications and strategy).\u201d\n\nWhat happened, according to Smith, might be the result of changing weather patterns. Adult sturgeons in the river spawned later than usual, sometime in June, possibly because of the late spring and colder water temperatures. They still were upstream in mid-September. Normally, they are downstream or in Muskegon Lake.\n\nThe young that died were 6 to 8 inches long; all were born this year. And it is known that sturgeons, like the mudpuppies that died, are susceptible to TFM.\n\n\u201cWe were never made aware of any concerns,\u201d said Shawn Nowicki, the supervisory fish biologist with the Fish and Wildlife Service\u2019s Marquette Biological Station. She coordinates the TFM treatment program.\n\n\u201cWe put a treatment schedule together in January and then consult with state agencies about the dates,\u201d Nowicki said. \u201cWe scheduled the Muskegon as late as possible, and there were no concerns or issues (expressed by the DNR) then.\u201d\n\nThe Muskegon\u2019s treatment was changed from mid-August to mid-September, she added, because of concerns sturgeon might be present in August. The treatment schedules for many rivers were all developed at that time. Work orders then went out to the field. The treatment was executed as planned, with no glitches. Everything was done to standard, Nowicki said.\n\nWas it worth it?\n\nAnglers, however, reported seeing dead sturgeon along with walleyes, northern pike, smallmouth bass and salmon.\n\nNowicki said she was aware of the sturgeons, salmon, logperch and mudpuppies, along with \u201cthousands and thousands of sea lamprey larvae \u2014 the most observed during a treatment.\u201d\n\nThat, she suggested, was a greater good.\n\n\u201cThe Muskegon River has 4.5 million sea lamprey larvae in it,\u201d Nowicki said. \u201cIf we didn\u2019t treat it, the river would produce 111,000 parasitic adults annually. Each of those can kill 40 pounds of fish, so we are looking at 4.5 million pounds of Great Lakes fish (that are saved). It\u2019s unfortunate that this happened, but we are saving those adult fish that are out in the lake already.\u201d\n\nJay Wesley, the southern Lake Michigan supervisor for the DNR, said, \u201cIt\u2019s not big news that TFM affects non-target species. And, we write off other fish mortality for the greater good of the Great Lakes because we know we have to keep the number of lamprey down.\n\n\u201cBut when you see a threatened species affected, it is a concern. We spend a lot of time and effort trying to rehabilitate those species, so that is something we will try to do better in the future.\u201d\n\nDNR fisheries chief Jim Dexter concurred.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a concern for everyone,\u201d Dexter said. \u201cWhat this will lead to is further discussion by all the management agencies on the Great Lakes about how we can fine-tune treatment so we don\u2019t lose sturgeon. Thirty-two is a lot of dead sturgeons.\u201d\n\nFar too many to allow for a state threatened species.\n\nEmail Howard Meyerson at howardmeyerson@gmail.com; follow him on his blog: The Outdoor Journal at howardmeyerson.com and on Twitter at twitter.com/hmeyerson\n\n", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "living", "title": "When the greater good might not be good enough", "og": {"site_name": "MLive.com", "description": "MLive Outdoors Columnist Howard Meyerson features a sturgeon kill that took place in mid-September (2014)  on the Muskegon River when the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service conducted a sea lamprey treatment there.", "title": "When the greater good might not be good enough", "url": "http://www.mlive.com/outdoors/index.ssf/2014/10/when_the_greater_good_might_no.html", "image": "http://image.mlive.com/home/mlive-media/width620/img/outdoors_impact/photo/16086914-standard.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://image.mlive.com/home/mlive-media/width620/img/outdoors_impact/photo/16086914-standard.jpg", "description": "MLive Outdoors Columnist Howard Meyerson features a sturgeon kill that took place in mid-September (2014)  on the Muskegon River when the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service conducted a sea lamprey treatment there.", "site": "@mlive", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "When the greater good might not be good enough"}, "article_date_updated": "Sunday, October 19, 2014,  6:26 AM", "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "MLive.com", "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Sunday, October 19, 2014,  6:26 AM", "article_author": "Howard Meyerson | The Grand Rapids Press", "Description": "MLive Outdoors Columnist Howard Meyerson features a sturgeon kill that took place in mid-September (2014)  on the Muskegon River when the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service conducted a sea lamprey treatment there."}, "article_summary": "Wildlife and fisheries management is full of seemingly damaging actions \u2014 those undertaken to achieve some \u201cgreater good,\u201d meaning the betterment of a particular species.\nBut, what if attaining that greater good means killing a threatened species?\nWork to restore them in the Muskegon River has been ongoing since 2006.\nAnd, we write off other fish mortality for the greater good of the Great Lakes because we know we have to keep the number of lamprey down.\n\u201cThe Muskegon River has 4.5 million sea lamprey larvae in it,\u201d Nowicki said."}
