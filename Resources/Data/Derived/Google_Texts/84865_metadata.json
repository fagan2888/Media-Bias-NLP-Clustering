This suggests that the wearable market is still very much consumer-driven, with growing support from payers but little acceptance from healthcare providers.\n\n\"Digital health tools have exploded in growth - but more so in the lifestyle management category than in clinical/disease management,\u201d Bryce Williams, HealthMine\u2019s CEO and president, said in remarks accompanying the March 2016 survey of 500 newly insured consumers. \"Every member may not benefit from an activity tracker. For these tools to be effective, they must be tailored to individual needs and connect to the individual's bigger picture of health data.\"\n\nAnd that bigger picture may very well include a chronic condition.\n\nAccording to the survey, 59 percent are dealing with at least one chronic condition. This coincides with a recent Blue Cross Blue Shield Association report that finds Americans enrolling in a health plan following the 2014 expansion under the Affordable Care Act have more chronic conditions and incur more medical costs. Simply put, these consumers are in more need of expensive healthcare services.\n\nThose bills could be eased somewhat with a chronic care management plan that includes mHealth monitoring. And yet, of the almost 60 percent in the HealthMine survey who have a chronic condition, only 7 percent reported using a digital health tool for care management.\n\nThis time, however, the problem may not lie in engagement, but motivation. According to the survey, 52 percent are enrolled in a wellness program, and one-third received a digital health device and/or app from their wellness program.\n\nBroken down further, 50 percent use an exercise, fitness or pedometer app, while 38 percent have a wearable activity tracker like a Fitbit or Jawbone. Other listed in the survey included a food/nutrition app (46 percent), weight loss app (39 percent), heart rate app (30 percent), pharmacy app (28 percent), patient portal 22 percent), sleep app (22 percent), blood pressure app (19 percent), smart/wireless scale (16 percent) and stress app (15 percent).\n\nMost of those numbers are good, indicating consumers are using digital health devices and apps to improve their health and wellness. In fact, 42 percent of those surveyed cited \u201cknowledge of my numbers\u201d is the biggest motivator to using technology tools, while another 26 percent cited \u201cimproving my health\u201d and 19 percent said \u201caccountability \u2013 I know someone is tracking the results.\u201d\n\nConversely, while two-thirds said their wellness program offers incentives for using digital health tools, only 10 percent listed that as the biggest motivator.\n\nTaken as a whole, the survey indicates newly insured Americans are interested in using mHealth devices and platforms to track their health, and they\u2019re motivated by personal responsibility more than rewards or incentives. But if they have a chronic condition \u2013 and more than half of them do, according to the survey \u2013 they aren\u2019t using mHealth for health management.\n\nMore succinctly, according to the survey, only 5 percent use a telemedicine app, 6 percent use a smoking cessation app, 7 percent use a disease management app, and 9 percent use a blood glucose monitor.\n\nThat\u2019s where mHealth may have the most immediate impact. Studies have shown that chronic disease costs billions each year in care management, with the typical high-end chronic disease patient spending 13 times more on outpatient services, 11 times more on professional services and 17 times more on medications than the average consumer.\n\nThat\u2019s where healthcare use and costs are high. And that\u2019s where the provider market need to step in and take a stand.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Survey finds divide between digital health, chronic disease management", "author": "mHealthIntelligence", "og": {"url": "http://mhealthintelligence.com/news/digital-health-gets-a-failing-grade-in-chronic-care-management", "type": "article", "image": "http://mhealthintelligence.com/images/site/articles/468404289.jpg", "site_name": "mHealthIntelligence", "title": "Digital Health Gets a Failing Grade in Chronic Care Management"}, "twitter": {"description": "Survey finds divide between digital health, chronic disease management", "title": "Digital Health Gets a Failing Grade in Chronic Care Management", "image": {"src": "http://mhealthintelligence.com/images/site/articles/468404289.jpg"}, "creator": "@mHealthIntel", "site": "@mHealthIntel", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "index, follow", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "Most of those numbers are good, indicating consumers are using digital health devices and apps to improve their health and wellness.\nAnd yet, of the almost 60 percent in the HealthMine survey who have a chronic condition, only 7 percent reported using a digital health tool for care management.\nBut if they have a chronic condition \u2013 and more than half of them do, according to the survey \u2013 they aren\u2019t using mHealth for health management.\nThose bills could be eased somewhat with a chronic care management plan that includes mHealth monitoring.\n\"Digital health tools have exploded in growth - but more so in the lifestyle management category than in clinical/disease management,\u201d Bryce Williams, HealthMine\u2019s CEO and president, said in remarks accompanying the March 2016 survey of 500 newly insured consumers."}
