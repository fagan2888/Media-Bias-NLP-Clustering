Ted Cruz (R-TX) took aim at his opponent GOP presidential front-runner Donald Trump, arguing conservatives don\u2019t want a candidate that once supported Democrats.\n\nPartial transcript as follows:\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: \u201cThat may be true, but as long as you and Marco Rubio are going after each other, doesn\u2019t that give Donald Trump a clear path?\u201d\n\nCRUZ: \u201cLook, no doubt. And I thought the question you asked Marco a minute ago about why he\u2019s afraid to take on Donald Trump is a great question. You know, if you look at Donald, Donald devotes all of his time and energy, all of his money, to attacking me. That demonstrates that Donald sees me as the only real threat to him. And for that matter, Marco devotes all of his time and energy to attacking me as well. He\u2019s been unwilling or afraid or for whatever reason he won\u2019t take on Donald Trump. If you want to beat Donald Trump, you\u2019ve got to go with the only campaign that has demonstrated we can beat Donald Trump. And I\u2019ll tell you going in to Super Tuesday, I think we are positioned nine days from today to have an amazing day on Super Tuesday. Our base on the ground is strong. And listen, Republicans want a real conservative. They don\u2019t want someone like Donald Trump who supported Jimmy Carter and John Kerry and Hillary Clinton, who supported expanding ObamaCare into socialized medicine, who supported the Wall Street bailouts and cronyism in the Obama stimulus. They want instead someone who will stand up to the Washington deals.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Cruz: Voters Want a Real Conservative --- Not Trump Who Supported Carter, Kerry and Hillary", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Cruz: Voters Want a Real Conservative --- Not Trump Who Supported Carter, Kerry and Hillary", "title": "Cruz: Voters Want a Real Conservative - Not Trump Who Supported Carter, Kerry and Hillary - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2016/02/cruz-1.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/video/2016/02/21/cruz-republicans-want-a-real-conservative-not-trump-who-supported-carter/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Cruz: Voters Want a Real Conservative --- Not Trump Who Supported Carter, Kerry and Hillary", "title": "Cruz: Voters Want a Real Conservative - Not Trump Who Supported Carter, Kerry and Hillary - Breitbart", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2016/02/cruz-1.jpg", "creator": "@pamkeyNEN", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true", "app_id": 1243316582352556}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Donald Trump, Ted Cruz,2016 Presidential Race, Breitbart TV,Cruz", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "2016 Presidential Race", "tag": "Ted Cruz", "published_time": "2016-02-21T11:39:50-07:00", "categories": "Breitbart TV,2016 Presidential Race"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "If you want to beat Donald Trump, you\u2019ve got to go with the only campaign that has demonstrated we can beat Donald Trump.\nThey don\u2019t want someone like Donald Trump who supported Jimmy Carter and John Kerry and Hillary Clinton, who supported expanding ObamaCare into socialized medicine, who supported the Wall Street bailouts and cronyism in the Obama stimulus.\nYou know, if you look at Donald, Donald devotes all of his time and energy, all of his money, to attacking me.\nHe\u2019s been unwilling or afraid or for whatever reason he won\u2019t take on Donald Trump.\nAnd I thought the question you asked Marco a minute ago about why he\u2019s afraid to take on Donald Trump is a great question."}
