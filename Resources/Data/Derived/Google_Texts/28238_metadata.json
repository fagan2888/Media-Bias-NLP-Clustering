According to federal health officials, 35 states are now experiencing \u201cwidespread influenza activity.\u201d And although the flu typically has the biggest impact on children and seniors, officials are noticing a different pattern this year.\n\nSo far this season, about 61 percent of people who landed in the hospital with the flu have been adults in between the ages of 18 and 65. That\u2019s a sharp contrast to the trend in previous years, when senior citizens over the age of 65 have made up more than half of flu-related hospitalizations. Public health experts believe that\u2019s because the H1N1 strain is more dangerous for the younger people who assume they don\u2019t need to worry about the flu.\n\nSo far, a 29-year-old woman and a 41-year-old man have died after experiencing flu-like symptoms. But states are beginning to confirm additional deaths. There have been at least 16 flu-related deaths in the Bay Area alone among people under the age of 65.\n\nDr. Daniel Spogen, who chairs the department of family and community medicine at the University of Nevada School of Medicine, told HealthDay that young adults incorrectly assume they don\u2019t need a flu shot. \u201cThe ones that tend to be sick this season are young and otherwise healthy adults,\u201d Spogen noted. \u201cIf you take a look at the data, the people who are getting sick enough to be hospitalized are the ones who didn\u2019t get their flu shot.\u201d\n\nAccording to a new analysis released on Tuesday, almost two-thirds of people between the ages of 18 and 65 skipped out on the flu shot during the 2012-2013 season. That\u2019s in line with data from CDC officials, who estimate that just 30 percent of people in this age range get vaccinated against the flu each year.\n\nLast year\u2019s flu season was particularly harsh, resulting in overcrowded emergency rooms and leading some lawmakers to declare an official state of emergency. But public health officials warn that this season threatens to be even worse. \u201cBased on what we\u2019re seeing so far, this year will be a very different picture than last year,\u201d Michael Osterholm, the director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, told USA Today in an interview last week. \u201cMark my word, by the end of next week we\u2019ll probably see some fear and panic as it starts to hit kids.\u201d\n\nLast year, 90 percent of the children who died from the flu hadn\u2019t received their vaccinations.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "The same strain of flu that caused the 2009 \"swine flu\" pandemic is spreading rapidly this year, and most young adults aren't protected from it.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "The same strain of flu that caused the 2009 \"swine flu\" pandemic is spreading rapidly this year, and most young adults aren't protected from it.", "title": "Flu Season Is Hitting Young People Harder This Year Because They\u2019re Not Getting Their Shots", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/health/2014/01/14/3162641/flu-season-young-people/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/flu-shot-e1390319812428.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The same strain of flu that caused the 2009 \"swine flu\" pandemic is spreading rapidly this year, and most young adults aren't protected from it.", "creator": "@Tara_CR", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/flu-shot-321x214.jpg", "title": "Flu Season Is Hitting Young People Harder This Year Because They\u2019re Not Getting Their Shots", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-health", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/flu-shot-e1390319812428.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/flu-shot-e1390319812428.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2014-01-14T16:52:34+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/tculpressler"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9e47\"", "article_summary": "Health Flu Season Is Hitting Young People Harder This Year Because They\u2019re Not Getting Their Shots CREDIT: ShutterstockThe U.S. is in the midst of a particularly severe flu season, dominated by the H1N1 strain \u2014 popularly called \u201cswine flu\u201d \u2014 responsible for the 2009 pandemic that killed 284,000 people worldwide.\nLast year\u2019s flu season was particularly harsh, resulting in overcrowded emergency rooms and leading some lawmakers to declare an official state of emergency.\nBut public health officials warn that this season threatens to be even worse.\n\u201cThe ones that tend to be sick this season are young and otherwise healthy adults,\u201d Spogen noted.\nSo far this season, about 61 percent of people who landed in the hospital with the flu have been adults in between the ages of 18 and 65."}
