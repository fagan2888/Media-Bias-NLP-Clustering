When it's breezy, wear a scarf that flatters your skin or matches your eyes. Swap out your old glasses for a pair of classic, plastic frames in a color that matches your hair. \u2022 Wear a sport jacket: Pair a jacket with slacks or properly fitting, dark-wash jeans in a straight cut. \u2022 Vest side: Consider wearing a vest. Just make sure it buttons comfortably. \u2022 Go black: Black shoes match everything. Pick narrow-toe (not round) slip-ons or lace-ups. \u2022 Add blue: When wearing a suit, pair it with either a blue shirt or a blue tie. \u2022 Stand up straight: Slouching will get you nowhere \u2014 career-wise, date-wise and respect-wise.\n\nKendall Qualls was so appalled that he took a photo of the man, dining in a nice restaurant. A VPL (visible panty line) had nothing on this man's VPC (visible plumber's crack).\n\n\"I've seen enough underwear by now, and man, it's killing me. The involuntary exposure is not a pretty sight,\" Qualls says. \"I'm sad that I have to say it, but it happens too frequently: Wear a belt.\"\n\nThat's his first piece of advice for the modern American man.\n\nHe also thinks every man should own a navy blue blazer and a collared shirt, either a polo or dress shirt.\n\nThese aren't revolutionary ideas, but they are far from commonplace in today's society, says Qualls, of Erie. He says the degeneration in the American man's attire is directly linked with the decline in chivalry, manners and, well, self-respect. He's working on a book about this topic, \"Man up and Dress Up: Reviving American Masculinity and Chivalry.\"\n\nKendall Qualls, of Erie, is working on a book about cleaning up the way American men dress and act. (Courtesy photo)\n\n\"It's starkingly embarrassing for American men. We need to sharpen this up,\" Qualls says.\n\n\"Man Up\" will identify some of the common concerns about how men look and act and provide specific solutions that any man can implement to transform his life, and that of the women around him, Qualls says.\n\nMultiple studies have shown women aren't impressed with how men treat them these days. One study, by Scaramouche & Fandango, found 61 percent of women polled preferred the image of a man in the '50s to young men of today, in large part because of their manners.\n\nThat's not to say we should regress to the '50s and remove women from the workforce, Qualls says.\n\n\"But just because women have advanced doesn't mean we're off the hook\" and can let it all go, Qualls says.\n\nQualls says his campaign has nothing to do with socio-economic lines; hyper-casual dress of the typical American male \u2014 a T-shirt and baggy jeans \u2014 spans age, income and is not just relegated to notoriously relaxed Colorado.\n\n\"The message is for American men that they need to sharpen up,\" he says.\n\nQualls is running a Kickstarter campaign to raise money to publish his book nationally. Otherwise, he hopes to self-publish it.\n\nQualls, vice president of marketing for a $27 billion global medical device company, says he's not blaming men.\n\n\"They don't know any better,\" he says. \"Believe me, it's not being rude. The culture reinforces this. What has happened to the guys?\"\n\nAimee Heckel: 303-473-1359, heckela@dailycamera.com or twitter.com/aimeemay", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/lifestyles/ci_28165256/what-happened-men-distinction-fashion-advice-modern-american-guys", "sailthru.author": "By Aimee Heckel \n \n  Staff Writer", "ag": {"canon": "BoulderDailyCamera:article:28165256:view"}, "startDate": "2015-05-23T16:00:00-0600", "twitter": {"domain": "dailycamera.com", "description": "Kendall Qualls was so appalled that he took a photo of the man, dining in a nice restaurant.
