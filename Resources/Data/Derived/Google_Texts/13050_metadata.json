Walgreen's stock looked fairly valued, even if it didn't win back the customers it lost during its battle with Express Scripts.\n\nWalgreen had a strong balance sheet that looked like it would survive another economic downturn.\n\nWalgreen had a strong dividend and dividend growth history and looked capable of keeping that trend alive.\n\nNet: The gain on Walgreen's business recovery was a nice bonus, but that recovery wasn't needed to make the stock seem worth owning in the first place.\n\nIn other words, when stocks have low enough expectations priced into them, there's a reasonable shot that the surprises they'll have for their owners will be good ones.
