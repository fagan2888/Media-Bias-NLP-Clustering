This year the GOP closed that gap\u2014and one all-female consulting firm is a big reason why.\n\nWhen Katie Packer Gage and Ashley O\u2019Connor sat down to lunch at Boston\u2019s Anthem restaurant one day in the winter of 2012, their conversation quickly turned to what had gone wrong with Mitt Romney\u2019s presidential campaign.\n\nGage had been Romney\u2019s deputy campaign manager, while O\u2019Connor was director of advertising. Both took part in the campaign\u2019s daily strategy meetings, and both were asking themselves how Romney had lost to Barack Obama by four points. That defeat was driven largely by Romney losing women voters by an insurmountable 11 points.\n\n\u201cRepublicans weren\u2019t doing a very effective job of communicating the Republican message to women,\u201d said Gage. \u201cWe asked how we could go about doing that better, and ultimately that\u2019s how Burning Glass came together.\u201d\n\nBurning Glass Consulting is the all-female consulting firm Gage and O\u2019Connor founded in 2013 along with GOP pollster Christine Matthews to focus Republican campaigns solely on refining their message to women voters. Burning Glass is also a major piece of the puzzle of how the GOP was able not only to neutralize but in some cases defeat the Democrats\u2019 \u201cwar on women\u201d message that had hurt some Republican campaigns badly with female voters in 2010 and 2012.\n\nAs a party, Burning Glass told Republicans, they needed to recruit better candidates, shut down GOP voices that made comments that would be offensive to women voters, and prepare campaigns for the Democrats to replay their \u201cwar on women\u201d message in 2014 on a national scale.\n\n\u201cOne of the first things that we felt was important was avoiding another Todd Akin or Richard Murdock moment, which was so difficult to deal with in 2012,\u201d Gage said. \u201cThe whole candidate-recruitment process, making sure that one candidate was not going to put our whole party in a negative light, was something we felt strongly about.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Connor also said the party needed better polling information about women voters, including why so many had responded to the Democrats\u2019 message in 2012 that Republicans were essentially bad for women, especially on social issues.\n\n\u201cComing into 2014, we really wanted to have some good research and data to be able to talk about how to handle this, because we knew it was coming,\u201d O\u2019Connor said. \u201cFor us, it was really important to make sure that candidates were ready for this and that they knew how to handle it. We learned that you can\u2019t just dismiss it. You have to be ready to talk about those issues as well as other issues.\u201d\n\nOver the course of 2013 and 2014, as Democratic campaigns targeted female voters on abortion rights, equal pay, and access to birth control, Burning Glass worked with the House Republican caucus to train members to avoid Todd Akin-style gaffes about things like \u201clegitimate rape\u201d; with Senate Republican candidates on debate prep and issue messaging around the Affordable Care Act; and with independent expenditure groups on the tone and tenor of their ads.\n\nThe results speak for themselves. Burning Glass\u2019s 2014 client list reads like a page out of the new Senate roster, including candidates or groups in Arkansas, Georgia, Colorado, Louisiana, North Carolina, and Virginia. In each contest, the Republican candidate outperformed the GOP result from 2012 among women voters. All but Ed Gillespie in Virginia won, and even Gillespie made significant gains among female voters compared to now-Gov. Terry McAuliffe\u2019s nine-point win over Ken Cuccinelli.\n\nAmong GOP victories in 2014, no other race is quite as emblematic of Republicans\u2019 new approach to women as the Colorado Senate race, where incumbent Democratic Sen. Mark Udall lost to Rep. Cory Gardner after Udall spent nearly the entire campaign talking about women\u2019s access to abortion and birth control. Gardner, a sunny, 40-year-old House member, responded with a position championed by Burning Glass for Republicans to stand by their opposition to abortion, but also push for women\u2019s expanded access by making it available without a prescription.Udall won with women by four points, but it wasn\u2019t enough to counter Gardner\u2019s 20-point margin among men.\n\n\u201cColorado was a great example of Democrats deciding to run a playbook and stick to it,\u201d said O\u2019Connor. \u201cI think Sen. Udall make a really grave mistake by only focusing on \u2018women\u2019s issues\u2019 and just beating it over and over and over when people, and especially women, in Colorado wanted to hear more from him.\u201d\n\nIn Iowa, a state that had never elected a women to Congress, women split their votes evenly, 49 percent to 49 percent, between Joni Ernst and the Democrat, Rep. Bruce Braley, while Ernst swept men\u2019s votes by 18 points.\n\nIn Georgia, North Carolina, and Louisiana, where Democrats had female candidates, Burning Glass suggested Republicans stay away from aggressively negative ads and instead feature Michelle Nunn, Kay Hagan, and Mary Landrieu\u2019s own words supporting President Obama, who was unpopular in those states among the women who were likely to turn out in the midterm elections.\n\n\u201cYou let the opponents\u2019 own words work against them,\u201d O\u2019Connor said of the strategy. \u201cTherefore, we\u2019re not attacking her, we\u2019re saying, \u2018Here\u2019s where she stands, here\u2019s what she\u2019s saying.\u2019\u201d\n\nGet The Beast In Your Inbox!
