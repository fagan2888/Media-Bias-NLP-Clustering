JACKSONVILLE, Fla - We went inside a popular restaurant in the Regency area because it was shut down because of roaches. O' Charley's on Commerce Center Drive was shut down because of 20 live roaches. They were found in a prep area that the inspector wrote an employee had just prepped chicken in.

Dairy Queen on University Boulevard was cited last week withive5 high priority violations. Frozen raw burgers were stored over bags of fries. The manager rearranged the food. A manager was seen talking on the phone and then grabbed toast for customers. The inspector discussed hand washing with the employee and also one roach was spotted coming out from underneath the chest freezer. Two days after the failing inspection the Dairy Queen was checked again and this time it passed.

Last week Ellen's Oriental on 103rd Street was cited with five high priority violations. Another employee was seen washing her hands with no soap. There was also raw fish on a shelf above green beans and flan that had to be thrown out because it was made more than seven days ago. All of these problems were fixed on site but the inspector must come back in three months for a recheck.

Finally, Uptown Pizza and Wings on Lane Avenue had two failing inspections in a row. The first one was last week when the inspector found 11 high priority violations. They found more than a dozen dry rodent droppings in the kitchen, raw hamburger on the same container as cooked hamburger. They had to throw the cooked meat away. They also saw an employee wash his hands without soap and then plate food. The inspector corrected many of the problems on site and came back the next day.
