Kirsten Gillibrand\u2019s most notable ally might be her most improbable.\n\nThe New York Democrat is taking on the goliath U.S. military over a central premise: that a commander has sole authority over his underlings.\n\nWhen it comes to a plague of sexual assaults, she proposes yanking a commander\u2019s authority to decide whether an allegation is prosecuted. Her bill to institute an independent system is expected to be voted on this week.\n\nThe intrepid challenge to the military\u2019s hallowed \u201cchain of command\u201d lures mostly Democrats. But there\u2019s also Republican freshman firebrand Ted Cruz of Texas.\n\nWashington is a naval-gazing, claustrophobic town that can turn on caricature. It\u2019s easier to label folks saints or sinners than capture life\u2019s true complexity.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s portraying opponents as too dumb to know the truth, or smart enough and wanting people to suffer. In fact, most people are neither stupid nor evil,\u201d Cruz told me Friday.\n\nNobody is more subject to cartoonish depiction than Cruz, 43, who joined the cozy Senate Club just 13 months ago after a huge upset win in his very first campaign.\n\nHe\u2019s thus derided as a fire-breathing, self-promoting Tea Party \u201cwacko bird\u201d (John McCain\u2019s term, for which he\u2019s since apologized) who is interested in scorching earth, not compromising.\n\nIn fact, he\u2019s more wonk than wacko bird. A failing might be revealing a bit too much head, not quite enough heart \u2014 which might make him a bit of a conservative counterpart to President Obama.\n\nAlso like Obama, there\u2019s brainpower and fearlessness. He\u2019s shrewd and has a penchant for empirical results.\n\nWhen it came to Gillibrand\u2019s argument, Cruz said that two realities were ultimately convincing.\n\nFirst, after decades of well-intentioned efforts, the military was failing and female victims were ever more reluctant to come forward out of fear.\n\nSecond, U.S. allies such as Great Britain and Israel had instituted similar reforms and not experienced declines in order and discipline, as the Pentagon warns.\n\nCruz did struggle. If you\u2019re going to change the culture as it relates to commanders, he said, you run risks by removing them from the process and not \u201cincentivizing them\u201d to change that culture.\n\n\u201cThat gave me the most pause,\u201d he said. But he sided with Gillibrand.\n\nAnd this was all before his national profile reached a zenith last fall, with his nearly 21-hour, sort-of filibuster of Obamacare.\n\nThat endeared him to many opponents of the law and chagrined others. It also came amid his very public campaign to push Republicans to not fund government even if they did fund Obamacare.\n\nHe came off as a catalyst of the subsequent government shutdown. Some GOP colleagues thought it was dumb, in the process revealing their own \u201cHow dare he?!\u201d attitude toward the freshman.\n\nAnd at that point, Cruz already had detractors on Capitol Hill, including Republicans who derided him as a self-promoting gadfly with a penchant to attack his own party colleagues.\n\nSome would roll their eyes when he came off to them like some eighth-grade civics teacher explaining to other senators \u2014 a generally self-confident and thin-skinned lot \u2014 how the Senate is meant to work.\n\nPerhaps it\u2019s the champ college debater in him, or the former Texas solicitor general who was an able litigant when arguing before the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nAnd, as an excellent profile in the current Texas Monthly underscores, the polarizing Cruz, 43, is a more nuanced and nimble figure than the D.C. caricature suggests.\n\nHis improbable Senate victory in 2012 included tactics that one Texas observer tagged \u201cpolitical jujitsu\u201d as he upended the heavy favorite in the GOP primary.\n\nThere was luck, but also cunning in branding himself a \u201cfighter\u201d in ways that belied a pretty establishment (Princeton, Harvard law) pedigree.\n\nAs for Gillibrand, she doesn\u2019t buy into the wacko bird caricature.\n\n\u201cI think he\u2019s looked at the issue [sexual assault] thoughtfully and objectively as a former lawyer and Supreme Court advocate and was persuaded by the substance.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe believes the decision-makers are biased and that this kind of reform would make a difference.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think he is thoughtful,\u201d she said, careful to add: \u201cI disagree with him on many issues.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s had probably the most impactful first year as a senator since . . . who?\u201d asked Bill Kristol, the Upper West Side native and conservative editor-observer.\n\n\u201cSome of what he\u2019s done is problematic, but it\u2019s still pretty darn impressive.\"\n\njwarren@nydailynews.com", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "James Warren", "twitter": {"description": "Warren: In a valiant struggle, Sen.
