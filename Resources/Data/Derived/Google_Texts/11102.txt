Shares of asset management holding company Janus Capital Group, Inc. (JNS) are up $4.44, or 39.65%, at $15.50, after the company this morning reported that Bill Gross, founder of bond giant PIMCO, has left his post as chief investment and joined Janus.

“Today, with a mixture of excitement and sadness, I am announcing that I have decided to join Janus Capital Group and end my association with PIMCO,” Gross said in a statement.

“But now, after having spent considerable time serving in senior management, it is a time for me to reduce executive and people management responsibilities at a larger firm and focus on the pure aspects of portfolio management at a smaller one. Janus is the right fit at the right time in my career – and my life.”

Janus said Gross will manage a recently launched Janus Global Unconstrained Bond Fund and related strategies, and will join Myron Scholes, Ph.D., and other members of the Janus team focused on global asset allocation. Mr. Gross’ employment will be effective September 29, 2014 and he will begin managing the Janus Global Unconstrained Bond Fund and related strategies effective October 6, 2014.

“The discussion with the FDA was productive,” Richard King, president and CEO of AcelRx said in a press release.”Over the coming months we will prepare, submit and finalize with the FDA the protocols required to complete this work. Assuming timely review by the FDA on the protocols, we anticipate being able to complete the work with a target to refile the Zalviso NDA in the first quarter of 2015.
