Here are your starts and sits for Week 10.\n\nStart\n\nJustin Forsett, RB, Baltimore Ravens\n\nBaltimore Ravens back Justin Forsett has cooled off in recent weeks, posting just one touchdown in his last three games. Expect things to turn around Sunday when the Ravens face Jacksonville who has allowed some big days to opposing running backs. Last week, Chris Ivory had just 48 scrimmage yards but had two rushing touchdowns against Jacksonville. Texans back Arian Foster had 125 scrimmage yards and rushing and receiving touchdowns in Week 7 against the Jags before tearing his Achilles tendon. Doug Martin had 123 yards rushing yards and two rushing touchdowns alongside 35 receiving yards and touchdown in Week 5. Start Forsett with confidence Sunday.\n\nJames Starks, RB, Green Bay Packers\n\nJames Starks owners rejoice! Green Bay\u2019s head coach Mike McCarthy named Starks the No.1 running back over Eddie Lacy. \u201cI would say James is our No. 1 back right now going into Detroit,\u201d McCarthy told the Green Bay Press-Gazette . \u201cHe\u2019s played very well. He\u2019s earned that opportunity. I\u2019ve never been, and we talked about this a number of times in the past, I\u2019m not a big believer in just riding one running back the whole season. We\u2019ll stay with the one-two punch.\u201d Starks was impressive last Sunday against Carolina. While he only had 39 yards on the ground, he added another 83 receiving yards and a receiving touchdown to that total. He\u2019s got a great matchup coming up against the Detroit Lions who allowed 97 rushing yards and a touchdown to Kansas City back Charcandrick West in Week 8. Detroit\u2019s defense is allowing 134 rushing yards per game this season. That puts them at 30th in the league.\n\nDeAngelo Williams, RB, Pittsburgh Steelers\n\nIf I had to choose a start of the week, Steelers back DeAngelo Williams\u2019 matchup against the Browns would be it. Cleveland has the league\u2019s worst run defense, allowing an average of 148 yards per game. After running back Le\u2019Veon Bell injured his MCL, Williams picked up right where he left off in Week 2, rushing for a huge 170-yard, two-touchdown day against the Raiders last week. He could very well go off again on Sunday.\n\nRyan Mathews, RB, Philadelphia Eagles\n\nIn last Sunday\u2019s game against the Cowboys, Eagles back Ryan Mathews racked up 67 rushing yards and a touchdown, marking his third time in four games he\u2019s rushed for at least 60 yards and a score. While his teammate DeMarco Murray will continue to lead the team in carries, Mathews has made the most of his carries. That trend should hold true Sunday when the Eagles host the Dolphins who are allowing 142 rushing yards per game, which is the second-most in the league.\n\nSit\n\nLarry Fitzgerald, WR, Arizona Cardinals\n\nWide receiver Larry Fitzgerald has been resurgent this year with 706 yards and seven touchdowns on the season. He\u2019s a top-five fantasy wide receiver for the first time since 2011. The good times are rolling for Fitzgerald and the Cardinals, but the 32-year-old won\u2019t have much success in Seattle for Sunday night\u2019s primetime tilt. In his last five games against Seattle, Fitz has averaged just 27 yards. He\u2019ll probably draw cornerback Richard Sherman who has been very effective in limiting Fitzgerald\u2019s production.\n\nLatavius Murray, RB, Oakland Raiders\n\nLatavius Murray and the Oakland Raiders have been one of the bigger surprises in real and fantasy football. While the Minnesota Vikings are far from impenetrable on defense, they excel in limiting backs to mediocre outings. The Raiders rank 18th in rushing offense with 105 yards per game. The Vikings rank 14th with 112 yards allowed per game. That looks good on paper but Minnesota has limited Matt Forte, Charcandrick West and Melvin Gordon to less than 70 scrimmage yards in past weeks. St. Louis running back Todd Gurley had a big day against them last week with 89 rushing yards, 20 receiving yards and a touchdown. However, that was Gurley\u2019s first sub-100-yard rushing game since Week 3. The Vikings have allowed just five rushing touchdowns on the season and I believe they\u2019ll rebound defensively against Oakland.\n\nRussell Wilson, QB, Seattle Seahawks\n\nThe last time quarterback Russell Wilson squared off against the Arizona Cardinals, he threw for 339 yards and two touchdowns while rushing for 88 yards and another score. That was the Wilson of old however. Through eight games this season, Wilson has thrown for multiple touchdowns just once (Week 2 at Green Bay). Wilson hasn\u2019t rushed for 88 yards at all this year, and he doesn\u2019t have a rushing score on the season. A lot of that drop off has to do with the fact that Wilson\u2019s offensive line isn\u2019t what it used to be during the team\u2019s Super Bowl seasons. This year, the Cardinals give up the sixth fewest points to quarterbacks in fantasy according to NFL.com.\n\nJeremy Maclin, WR, Kansas City\n\nLast week was a wake up call for the Denver Broncos and the defense will be eager to rebound from the loss to Indianapolis. Last week, Andrew Luck and the Colts had 252 yards of passing offense, well above the 181 yards per game average allowed by the Denver defense (honestly that average went up because of what the Colts did last week). With the defense reeling, expect them to return to form against Chiefs. Wide receiver Jeremy Maclin will probably line up against Chris Harris where he will be limited. Maclin had just 57 yards in the last meeting between the Broncos and Chiefs.\n\nCurb Your Enthusiasm\n\nMarshawn Lynch, RB, Seattle Seahawks\n\nSeahawks running back Marshawn Lynch has been far from beastly this season. Lynch has just two touchdowns over the course of the year. He has only one game in which he rushed for more than 100 yards this season. If he plays\u2013reports have him at a 50 percent chance\u2013I don\u2019t expect him to start being the Marshawn of old against the Cardinals. The Cardinals have only allowed three rushing touchdowns all season and an average of 91 rushing yards a game. Sunday night\u2019s game may be a low scoring affair with Beast Mode\u2019s numbers limited.\n\nHugh Johnson: 303-954-1037, hjohnson@denverpost.com or @HughJohnsonDP", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Fantasy Football Start/Sit Week 10: DeAngelo Williams, Larry Fitzgerald", "title": "Fantasy Football Start/Sit Week 10: DeAngelo Williams, Larry Fitzgerald", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/11/15/fantasy-football-startsit-week-10-deangelo-williams-larry-fitzgerald/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151115__Marshawn-Lynchp1.jpg", "height": 469}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151115__Marshawn-Lynchp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-11-15T09:08:23+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-05-23T05:33:10+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Fantasy Football"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3854\"", "article_summary": "Doug Martin had 123 yards rushing yards and two rushing touchdowns alongside 35 receiving yards and touchdown in Week 5.\nThe Cardinals have only allowed three rushing touchdowns all season and an average of 91 rushing yards a game.\nDeAngelo Williams, RB, Pittsburgh SteelersIf I had to choose a start of the week, Steelers back DeAngelo Williams\u2019 matchup against the Browns would be it.\nLast week, Chris Ivory had just 48 scrimmage yards but had two rushing touchdowns against Jacksonville.\nSitLarry Fitzgerald, WR, Arizona CardinalsWide receiver Larry Fitzgerald has been resurgent this year with 706 yards and seven touchdowns on the season."}
