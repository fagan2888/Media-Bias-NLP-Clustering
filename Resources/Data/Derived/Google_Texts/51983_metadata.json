Scott Tipton, R-Cortez, Thursday at the Durango Public Library.\n\n\u201cUnless we get not just Internet access, but some fast Internet access, La Plata County will suffer,\u201d said Jim Tencza, the owner of HDS Freight Services in Bayfield and a La Plata County planning commissioner.\n\nThe message was the same from businesses across the region, in all different industries.\n\nParelli Natural Horsemanship played a key role in bringing fiber optic Internet access to Archuleta County, but unless businesses are near U.S. Highway 160, the access is still limited, said Mark Weiler, the president of the company.\n\n\u201cOur community is dying. It is dying from the inside out,\u201d he said.\n\nLaying fiber-optic lines might not be financially realistic, but microwave links and a more equal playing field for Internet providers could help solve the problem, he said.\n\n\u201cCreate an environment where the monopolistic patterns of CenturyLink do not preclude access to wireless Internet,\u201d he said.\n\nInternet access is also a barrier when recruiting businesses and people who work from home to Vallecito, said Paul Eckenrode, president of the Vallecito Lake Chamber of Commerce.\n\n\u201cThis is something we are looking into,\u201d Tipton said. \u201cWe are having conversations with CenturyLink.\u201d\n\nIn August, CenturyLink accepted $26.5 million from the Federal Communications Commission to improve service to Colorado customers, according to a news release.\n\nThe company is working with the La Plata County Economic Development Alliance to identify areas that will see improved service, said Mark Soltes, a representative for the company in January.\n\nIn addition to lobbying for Internet, the group told Tipton the Affordable Care Act has slowed growth.\n\nIn some cases, owners have decided not to grow their businesses because of the law\u2019s health care requirements.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.durangoherald.com/article/20160310/NEWS01/160319985/", "site_name": "The Durango Herald", "image": "http://durangoherald.com/storyimage/DU/20160310/NEWS01/160319985/AR/0/AR-160319985.jpg?maxw=1000&imageversion=16by9", "type": "article", "title": "Small businesses in La Plata County push for better Internet"}, "fb": {"app_id": 263076300371367, "pages": 205518469520233}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd86c\"", "article_summary": "\u201cUnless we get not just Internet access, but some fast Internet access, La Plata County will suffer,\u201d said Jim Tencza, the owner of HDS Freight Services in Bayfield and a La Plata County planning commissioner.\nThe company is working with the La Plata County Economic Development Alliance to identify areas that will see improved service, said Mark Soltes, a representative for the company in January.\nInternet access is also a barrier when recruiting businesses and people who work from home to Vallecito, said Paul Eckenrode, president of the Vallecito Lake Chamber of Commerce.\nIn addition to lobbying for Internet, the group told Tipton the Affordable Care Act has slowed growth.\n\u201cCreate an environment where the monopolistic patterns of CenturyLink do not preclude access to wireless Internet,\u201d he said."}
