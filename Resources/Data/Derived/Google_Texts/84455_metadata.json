As trees grew back, songbirds and beavers returned, he says.\n\n\u201cThe dams (beavers) built provided habitats for muskrats, otters, ducks and fish and reptiles and amphibians,\u201d Monbiot says in the video, which now has more than 3.7 million views.\n\nMonbiot\u2019s talk was focused on the concept called \u201ctrophic cascade\u201d \u2014 when predator species suppress their prey, thus alleviating pressure on that animal\u2019s food source.\n\nMonbiot points to river banks growing sturdier with vegetation and rivers becoming less meandering, creating pools that attracted more wildlife. \u201cThe wolves changed the behavior of the rivers,\u201d Monbiot says.\n\nWell, not so much, say researchers at Colorado State University.\n\n\u201cIt has been popular and convenient to tell the romantic tale that wolves have restored Yellowstone, but our findings prove it is not so simple,\u201d said CSU professor Thompson Hobbs, who co-authored the paper.\n\nResearchers looked at 30 years of riparian willow growth and also the annual precipitation, stream flow, growing season length, soil moisture and abundance of elk.\n\nTheir central finding was the relationship between elk populations and willow growth cannot solely be attributed to the reintroduction of wolves but also is dependent on geography, climate and water supply for the willows.\n\n\u201cNo single force explains the patterns of plant establishment and growth in Yellowstone over the past three decades,\u201d Hobbs said in a press release.\n\nA 2013 CSU paper found beaver dams\u2019 impact on water levels were as responsible for the health of vegetation as elk. In other words: science, not romance.\n\nI contacted Chris Agnos, who produced the video of Monbiot\u2019s talk for his website, Sustainable Man. Agnos said the video was never meant to suggest other factors weren\u2019t at play.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t attribute any one effect in nature to any one cause in nature,\u201d he said. \u201cEverything is connected to everything and it all matters. That was the moral of the story.\n\n\u201cPerhaps some of the other causes of Yellowstone revival were omitted from the video, but if we were to identify every micro cause of Yellowstone, we would literally have to analyze every single action that every being has taken on the planet, since every action affects everything else, even if ever so slightly,\u201d Agnos added.\n\n\u201cThis does not take away from the impact the wolves have had; it only more accurately reflects the knowledge that there is no separation and that everything we do affects the entire world.\u201d\n\nE-mail Jeremy Meyer at jpmeyer@ denverpost.com.
