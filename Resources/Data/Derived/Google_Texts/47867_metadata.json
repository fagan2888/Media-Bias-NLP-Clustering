He touted their educational and professional credentials, and their life stories. And all of them survived this White House\u2019s very extensive vetting process.\n\nSrinivasan, a judge on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, checks every box \u2014 which is why he\u2019d already been considered a shoo-in for the high court if Ruth Bader Ginsburg had stepped down before the end of Obama\u2019s term.\n\nBut if Srinivasan doesn\u2019t want to sign up for what could be a year in limbo or if Obama decides to go with the more politically potent choice, well-connected lawyers say Lynch makes almost as much sense.\n\n\u201cObama\u2019s had a record of nominating people with sterling credentials,\u201d said Caroline Fredrickson, president of the American Constitutional Society, which does not endorse potential nominees. \u201cHe has brought greater diversity to the bench, so that will probably be on his mind to see if that\u2019s a possibility.\u201d\n\nSrinivasan, who immigrated with his family from India as a child (then grew up in Kansas, to boot) and went on to Stanford for undergradate, law and business school, clerked for Ronald Reagan appointee Sandra Day O\u2019Connor and was an assistant solicitor general under George W. Bush. He argued 25 cases before the Supreme Court and then became a deputy solicitor general under Obama.\n\nRepublicans delayed his appointment for six months when Obama nominated him to the D.C. Circuit in 2012. Then he was approved in committee and on the floor in 2013 by a vote of 97-0 \u2014 as it happens, just one short of the 98-0 vote count that put Scalia on the bench in 1986. Former Whitewater independent counsel Ken Starr was among the people who supported his nomination.\n\nSrinivasan would be the first Hindu on the Supreme Court, and took the oath for his current job on a copy of the Bhagavad Gita. He\u2019s spent just 2\u00bd years as a judge, which gives him that politically important shine of experience on the bench, but before that was a litigator, which means he\u2019s got very little record of judicial opinions to pick through. Democrats hate that he worked for Bush, Exxon, and Enron CEO Jeffrey Skilling.\n\nObama\u2019s nominating speech, delivered in his familiar how-can-you-disagree-with-this-based-on-anything-but-politics tone, would write itself. Well-connected lawyers in town spent Sunday imagining the possibility that O\u2019Connor or Harvie Wilkinson, the conservative former chief judge for the Fourth Circuit whom Srinivasan also clerked for, might be willing to testify for him in front of Congress.\n\nPlus, if Srinivasan were to be confirmed to the high court, he\u2019d be 49 when he joined, allowing him to flip the ideological balance of the court now and likely for decades to come.\n\nLynch looks good for many of the same reasons that drive talk of Srinivasan, which all helped make her a surprise pick for attorney general in November 2014.\n\nObama touted her childhood in North Carolina rooted in the civil rights movement and her well-respected work as a United States attorney from Brooklyn (approved in 2010 for a second tour on the job), as she became his answer to how he\u2019d possibly get a replacement for Eric Holder through Congress: by holding her up as the first female African-American attorney general.\n\nLynch\u2019s confirmation fight became one of the longest in American history, but facing this same Republican Senate, the White House and allies wore it down to a win last year by pressing those points over and over again. But the wounds from that fight may still be too fresh for the White House to put Lynch\u2019s name forward again, and there\u2019s a sense among lawyers with close ties to the White House that she wouldn\u2019t get as high a grade as Srinivasan on Obama\u2019s former constitutional law professor test.\n\nObama might pick neither Srinivasan nor Lynch, but most of the other names floating as serious possibilities in the informed speculation fit Obama\u2019s nomination formula, too.\n\nThe unfolding presidential election and the much higher stakes of a lifetime appointment make these circumstances different from Obama\u2019s previous showdowns with Congress. Democrats\u2019 best case scenario is probably that the five blue and swing state Senate Republicans up for reelection this year (New Hampshire\u2019s Kelly Ayotte, Wisconsin\u2019s Ron Johnson, Pennsylvania\u2019s Pat Toomey, Illinois\u2019 Mark Kirk and Ohio\u2019s Rob Portman) are driven to help the 46 Democrats to oppose a filibuster, and nine other Republicans somehow come along, because they\u2019re in safe seats or worried about the longer term political fallout for the GOP from Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell\u2019s threat to block any nominee.\n\n\u201cA large question is whether the fight is framed as one about the nominee, or President Obama. They are different fights,\u201d said Robert Raben, a former assistant attorney general under Bill Clinton who\u2019s managed and staffed many confirmations. Given how the battle lines have been drawn, Obama\u2019s play is against Republicans, not so much keeping Democrats in line, Raben said.\n\nThe White House is avoiding any comment about Obama\u2019s process or the potential nominees. All that aides will confirm is that he won\u2019t make an announcement this week.\n\n\u201cGiven that the Senate is currently in recess, we don\u2019t expect the president to rush this through this week, but instead will do so in due time once the Senate returns from their recess,\u201d said White House principal deputy press secretary Eric Schultz on Sunday.\n\nThe White House wouldn\u2019t comment on whether Obama has started having meetings with staff or reviewing materials about a possible confirmation. People familiar with the West Wing say that this situation is a surprise, both in Obama\u2019s confronting a vacancy in his final year and in having the open seat be Scalia\u2019s.\n\nThe White House has been struggling with much simpler confirmations. Obama\u2019s nominees to be ambassador to Norway and Sweden spent seven months held up by Sen. Ted Cruz, who was trying to make a statement about the Iran nuclear deal, and others are still being delayed. The White House also can\u2019t get a vote on Adam Szubin to be the Treasury undersecretary in charge of tracking terrorist finances, despite many public complaints centered, naturally, on the fact that Szubin\u2019s got strong credentials and a history of working for Republicans.\n\nThe White House was considering skipping a formal nomination of John King to be the new education secretary, though he\u2019s qualified and an African-American and has amazing life story: He was orphaned at 12 and found his way through public schools in New York. King has been acting secretary since October, and Obama formally nominated him only Friday afternoon, when the West Wing felt it had received enough assurances from Congress that, at least at that moment, it seemed like he\u2019d go through.\n\nAs the trenches are dug, the absolutists on the left are already preparing to settle for whatever they can get.\n\n\u201cBut is Srinivasan progressive?\u201d former Labor Secretary Robert Reich wondered on Facebook on Sunday morning, insisting that his \u201cWhite House mole\u201d had told him Srinivasan\u2019s the one.\n\nReich couldn\u2019t give an answer, but seemed fine with that.\n\n\u201cMy suspicion is Obama couldn't do better than Srinivasan,\u201d he wrote. \u201cNo other nominee [will] get a majority of Senate votes.\u201d\n\nJosh Gerstein contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "In pushing candidates through a reluctant Senate, he has emphasized demographic firsts and cooperation with GOP.", "title": "Srinivasan, Lynch fit Obama's formula for nominees", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2016/02/srinivasan-lynch-fit-obamas-formula-for-nominees-219296", "image": "http://static.politico.com/77/c5/64f8bdbc4fc1837674a825ec7d0b/160202-barack-obama-ap-1160.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "In pushing candidates through a reluctant Senate, he has emphasized demographic firsts and cooperation with GOP.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Obama might pick neither Srinivasan nor Lynch, but most of the other names floating as serious possibilities in the informed speculation fit Obama\u2019s nomination formula, too.\nThe White House is avoiding any comment about Obama\u2019s process or the potential nominees.\nThe White House wouldn\u2019t comment on whether Obama has started having meetings with staff or reviewing materials about a possible confirmation.\nThe White House has been struggling with much simpler confirmations.\n\u201cBut is Srinivasan progressive?\u201d former Labor Secretary Robert Reich wondered on Facebook on Sunday morning, insisting that his \u201cWhite House mole\u201d had told him Srinivasan\u2019s the one."}
