Politico notes that GOP lawmakers in the state got together to urge him to run earlier this month. But Donald said Monday he\u2019s not ready to commit to a gubernatorial bid, implying that the office was beneath him.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s see what happens,\u201d said the ever-enigmatic Trump. \u201cI had something else in mind, and this was not actually something that I wanted to do.\u201d\n\nAsked whether that something else was a presidential bid in 2016 Donald wouldn\u2019t say. Which I\u2019m sure he is hoping will create the perfect air of mystery and speculation to launch his 2016 campaign.\n\nOf course, 2012 saw Donald\u2019s presidential campaign crash and burn amid an embarrassing speech in Las Vegas punctuated with f-bombs and openly hostile threats to other countries. It also saw Trump fired from managing his own namesake Trump Place in New York. Donald also threatened the creator of a petition for Macy\u2019s to sever ties with Trump with a $25-million dollar lawsuit earlier in 2013 when the petition reached nearly 700,000 signatures.\n\nIn short, Trump is not well-liked.\n\nCompounding matters, Governor Cuomo\u2019s approval rating is only rising, hitting an impressive 65% in late November. And this is for the guy who orchestrated New York\u2019s marriage equality law and who\u2019s been an outspoken champion for Obamacare.\n\nSo Donald should probably find something else to do for the next couple years. Like maybe go back to looking for that birth certificate.", "article_metadata": {"description": "This should go well.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Death and Taxes", "description": "This should go well.", "title": "Donald Trump may run for governor of New York", "url": "http://www.deathandtaxesmag.com/211377/donald-trump-may-run-for-governor-of-new-york/", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://static.deathandtaxesmag.com/uploads/2013/12/Screen-Shot-2013-12-16-at-11.36.20-AM.png", "height": 408}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "This should go well.", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 119986914707220}, "keywords": "donald trump,donald trump governor,donald trump new york governor,politics", "article": {"published_time": "2013-12-16T15:57:40Z", "modified_time": "2013-12-16T15:57:40Z"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc96ed\"", "article_summary": "Professional wig mannequin and real estate developer Donald Trump hinted this morning that he may run for governor of New York next year against Governor Cuomo.\nIt also saw Trump fired from managing his own namesake Trump Place in New York.\nthe Donald responded to questions about how the Republican leadership needs him so badly in his home state.\nPolitico notes that GOP lawmakers in the state got together to urge him to run earlier this month.\nBut Donald said Monday he\u2019s not ready to commit to a gubernatorial bid, implying that the office was beneath him."}
