It is one of those rare, magical aptonyms that are subtle enough to have hidden in plain sight, until someone -- often an aptonymic genius such as myself -- makes the connection.\n\nThis aptonym is good not just because of its aptness, but because of the rarity of the sequencing of these letters in a name.\n\nI present to you a scientist profiled today in the New York Times, which of course made no mention of her parallel life as an aptonym because they no doubt failed to see it. She is urging ethical restraints in genetic manipulation, yet also is seeking intellectual property rights for a genome-editing process she pioneered. She is an expert in genetic sequencing. What does she do? She does DNA.
