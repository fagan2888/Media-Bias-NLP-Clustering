One family is without a home after theirs caught fire early Sunday morning in Greene County.

Curtis Hilbourn is the fire chief of Jason Volunteer Fire Department. He says his team, along with two other volunteer departments, arrived to 86 Piney Circle in Snow Hill around 5:15 this morning.

Hilbourn says flames could be seen from miles away.

He couldn't confirm how many people were in the house at the time of the fire, but says a family of four stays there.

One person was treated for smoke inhalation, but no one was taken to the hospital.

The house is said to be heavily damaged, which is why the Red Cross has stepped in to help the family find shelter, according to Hilbourn.

Meanwhile, the cause of the fire is still under investigation.
