Last year, the company upped their investment in marketing and training employees to handle complicated questions on the health care law and their impact on taxes, the Kansas City Star reports.\n\nThe company sees the IRS as being a facilitator of business of sorts, as the agency will be stepping up enforcements as penalties for not being enrolled in Obamacare increases.\n\n\u201cI have news for you: IRS enforcement is coming,\u201d warned Mark Ciaramitaro, vice president of taxes and health care at H&R Block. \u201cThe era of tax leniency with the Affordable Care Act is coming to an end.\u201d\n\nH&R Block is heavily invested in the law as they spent millions on high-priced lobbyists who worked tirelessly in helping shape Obamacare. The company, in fact, was the only tax preparation company to lobby for the health care overhaul.\n\nUp until 2007, H&R Block spent little in the way of lobbying. However, between 2007 and 2008, the company tripled its lobbying expenditures from $300,000 to $952,000. In 2009, Block upped their lobbying output even more, tallying $1,705,088 on the year before jumping up yet again to $1,960,000 in 2010. Since 2010, the company has topped $2 million in lobbying expenditures in both 2013 and 2014.\n\nDue to the company\u2019s involvement in helping craft Obamacare while seeking to benefit from the subsequent windfall profits, H&R Block\u2019s practices have received criticism.\n\n\u201cThis will help H&R\u2019s growth and profitability because they\u2019ll be able to charge all these consumers for more services, for more filing of forms,\u201d Gil Luria, the managing director of securities and investments company Wedbush told the Daily Caller.\n\n\u201cIn addition, they may get some new filers that ordinarily would have done taxes themselves because those filers will be uncomfortable doing taxes on their own.\u201d\n\nCompetitors of H&R Block have taken it upon themselves to counter their extra fees for filing out Obamacare forms.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t think people should have to pay extra for ACA-related forms,\u201d said Debra Hammer, a senior health care communications manager at Intuit.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Free Beacon", "description": "A tax company that spent millions on lobbyists to help shape Obamacare is set to \u201creap the benefits\u201d of their efforts through Affordable Care Act taxes.
