One of Chicago’s largest hospital and healthcare coalitions has named a new top leader. Dan Yunker will take over as CEO of the Metropolitan Chicago Healthcare Council on Sept. 30.



Yunker, 45, has been with MCHC for almost 10 years. Most notably, he has served as CEO of the group’s health information exchange and CEO of MCHC’s Land of Lincoln Health, a not-for-profit, consumer-governed health insurer that was started with $160 million in seed money through a program set up by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.





Prior to MCHC, Yunker worked at Aon Corp., the Healthcare Financial Management Association and Cadence Health.



Yunker will replace Kevin Scanlan, 65, who is retiring. Scanlan worked at MCHC, which represents hospitals, health systems, physician groups, nursing homes, insurers and other organizations, for 26 years, eight as CEO.
