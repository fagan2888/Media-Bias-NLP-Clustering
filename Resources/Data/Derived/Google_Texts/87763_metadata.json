Ted Cruz of Texas with 13 percent and former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin with 12 percent. All three were speakers at the fifth annual conference, sponsored by the Centennial Institute and Colorado Christian University.\n\nOther prominent conservatives who received votes included Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, former New York Lt. Gov. Betsy McCaughey, Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, Texas Gov. Rick Perry, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker and former Rep. Allen West of Florida.\n\nSEE ALSO: \u2018Carson for president\u2019 troops converge on Western Conservative Summit\n\nThe poll of 3,300 conference attendees wrapped up an event focused on how conservatives can win the battle of ideas in a culture that increasingly tilts toward progressives.\n\n\u201cWhat we have to do as conservatives is not just beat Republicans over the head and say, \u2018You\u2019ve got to carry our message and vote for our bills.\u2019 We have to pave the road for them,\u201d said former Sen. Jim DeMint of South Carolina, who now heads the Heritage Foundation.\n\n\u201cWe have to convince Americans that these ideas are best for them, and what we\u2019ll see is politics will follow the culture,\u201d said Mr. DeMint. \u201cThat\u2019s why I left the Senate. Politics is a lagging indicator \u2014 it follows the culture. If we can\u2019t win the battle of ideas among the American people, it doesn\u2019t matter who we elect. They eventually will have to vote with their constituents.\u201d\n\nSEE ALSO: Inside the Beltway: America still dreams of \u2018President\u2019 Ben Carson\n\nA big part of winning back the culture is connecting with younger voters, who overwhelmingly supported Barack Obama for president in 2008 and 2012. That means nominating candidates who have a better grasp of pop culture, said Charlie Kirk, head of the student group Turning Point USA.\n\n\u201cI have a really simple test for the next candidate that we\u2019re going to nominate for president of the United States: If you can\u2019t tell me which team LeBron James plays for, if you can\u2019t tell me if Derek Jeter is still playing baseball, and if you can\u2019t tell me how many \u2018Hunger Games\u2019 movies there are, then I really don\u2019t think you should be our nominee,\u201d Mr. Kirk said.\n\nSen. Tim Scott, South Carolina Republican, said conservatives need to seek out candidates who are upbeat and positive.\n\nHe cited Rep. Cory Gardner of Colorado, who is challenging Democratic Sen. Mark Udall, saying, \u201cYou can\u2019t see Cory and not smile, because he\u2019s always smiling.\n\n\u201cOne of the keys to success is making sure our candidates are likable and armed with the right message,\u201d Mr. Scott said.\n\nNo conservative gathering would be complete without a few shots at the left, and plenty of those were made at the Hyatt Regency Denver.\n\nSen. Mike Lee of Utah said the GOP must be the \u201cparty of ideas\u201d because Democrats are \u201cintellectually exhausted\u201d after decades of propping up the welfare state and dividing voters \u201cwith identity politics and the make-believe war on women.\u201d\n\nMr. West brought the crowd to its feet repeatedly with his dissection of the progressive agenda and how it failed to represent \u201cAmerica at its best,\u201d the conference theme.\n\n\u201cAmerica is at its worst when we enslave individuals economically,\u201d said Mr. West. \u201cIf you don\u2019t believe what I\u2019m talking about, go to any inner city, in Atlanta, in Detroit, in Chicago, in Washington, D.C., and Philadelphia, and you will see America when it is not at its best. You\u2019ll also see that liberal progressive socialists are in charge of those communities.\u201d\n\nMr. Cruz said he is optimistic because he sees parallels with the 1980 presidential election, when Ronald Reagan defeated Jimmy Carter after four years of economic stagnation and a \u201cnaive foreign policy.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf there\u2019s one person who\u2019s thrilled with the job President Obama\u2019s doing, it\u2019s Jimmy Carter,\u201d Mr. Cruz said.\n\nAnalysts are predicting this will be a grim election year for progressives, and Mr. Carson said he is seeing evidence of that on his tour to promote his latest book, \u201cOne Nation.\u201d\n\nPeople \u201care just completely fed up with what\u2019s going on with our nation,\u201d said Mr. Carson. \u201cOur nation is waking up very, very rapidly. I predict in November there\u2019s going to be a sea change, and the liberals will be scratching their heads. They won\u2019t be able to figure out what happened.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Dr. Ben Carson won the Western Conservative Summit's annual presidential straw poll Sunday, capping a three-day extravaganza billed as the \"rally on the right.\"", "Author": "Valerie Richardson", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Dr. Ben Carson won the Western Conservative Summit\u2019s annual presidential straw poll Sunday, capping a three-day extravaganza billed as the \u201crally on the right.\u201d", "title": "Carson wins straw poll as conservatives focus on winning battle of ideas", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/jul/20/carson-wins-straw-poll-conservatives-focus-winning/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/07/15/7_152014_beltway-carson8201.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/07/15/7_152014_beltway-carson8201.jpg", "title": "Carson wins straw poll as conservatives focus on winning battle of ide", "description": "Dr. Ben Carson won the Western Conservative Summit's annual presidential straw poll Sunday, capping a three-day extravaganza billed as the \"rally on the right.\"", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "news_keywords": "Politics, Ben Carson, Ted Cruz, Allen West, Denver"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdfaea\"", "article_summary": "Analysts are predicting this will be a grim election year for progressives, and Mr. Carson said he is seeing evidence of that on his tour to promote his latest book, \u201cOne Nation.\u201dPeople \u201care just completely fed up with what\u2019s going on with our nation,\u201d said Mr. Carson.\n\u201cAmerica is at its worst when we enslave individuals economically,\u201d said Mr. West.\nIf we can\u2019t win the battle of ideas among the American people, it doesn\u2019t matter who we elect.\nSen.
