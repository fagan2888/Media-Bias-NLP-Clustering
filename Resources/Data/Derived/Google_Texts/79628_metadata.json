As former Bush ambassador to Israel Daniel Kurtzer admits, it was as if Netanyahu\u2019s \u201carrogance [has] reached a point where he assumes Israel will ask and the United States simply [says] yes.\u201d\n\nBut for many American conservatives, the Netanyahu visit was a moment of celebration; some even openly wished that Netanyahu was our president instead of Obama. Here\u2019s one example, from Twitter:\n\nClick to enlarge.\n\nPublic Policy Polling actually did a poll that found Netanyahu has a 57 percent approval rating among Republican voters, higher than any potential Republican presidential nominee.\n\nBut there are a number of reasons conservatives should be wary about wanting Netanyahu as president, ranging from Israel\u2019s left-wing healthcare policy to its lack of a constitution to limit government power. Here are five:\n\n1. Israel\u2019s Universal Healthcare: While American conservatives rallied en masse in 2009 and 2010 to try to stop the modest Affordable Care Act, even Israel\u2019s most right-wing parties don\u2019t object to that country\u2019s universal healthcare system. Healthcare there today is managed by the 1995 National Health Insurance Law, which mandates that every Israeli citizen has a right to be covered by one of the country\u2019s four non-profit HMOs, with about 40 percent of the costs being covered through taxation from income and the state paying for the other 60 percent.\n\n2. Israel\u2019s Government Directly Pays for Abortions: In the United States, even most Democrats do not call for state subsidies for abortion and numerous other reproductive healthcare options. But Israel last year included abortion in the basket of health services covered under state-approved HMOs; the Times of Israelnotes that this makes Israel\u2019s abortion law \u201camong the world\u2019s most liberal.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The GOP is enamored with the Prime Minister, but Israel endorses many policies Republicans would loathe", "author": "Zaid Jilani", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The GOP is enamored with the Prime Minister, but Israel endorses many policies Republicans would loathe", "title": "5 reasons conservatives wouldn\u2019t actually want Netanyahu to be our president", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/03/05/5_reasons_conservatives_wouldnt_actually_want_netanyahu_to_be_our_president_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2012/05/mideast-israel-politics1-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The GOP is enamored with the Prime Minister, but Israel endorses many policies Republicans would loathe", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2012/05/mideast-israel-politics1-1280x960.jpg", "title": "5 reasons conservatives wouldn\u2019t actually want Netanyahu to be our president", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "5 reasons conservatives wouldn\u2019t actually want Netanyahu to be our president", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, AlterNet, Benjamin Netanyahu, IDF, Israel, Sharia Courts", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd6b4\"", "article_summary": "But there are a number of reasons conservatives should be wary about wanting Netanyahu as president, ranging from Israel\u2019s left-wing healthcare policy to its lack of a constitution to limit government power.\nIsrael\u2019s Universal Healthcare: While American conservatives rallied en masse in 2009 and 2010 to try to stop the modest Affordable Care Act, even Israel\u2019s most right-wing parties don\u2019t object to that country\u2019s universal healthcare system.\nPublic Policy Polling actually did a poll that found Netanyahu has a 57 percent approval rating among Republican voters, higher than any potential Republican presidential nominee.\nBut Israel last year included abortion in the basket of health services covered under state-approved HMOs; the Times of Israelnotes that this makes Israel\u2019s abortion law \u201camong the world\u2019s most liberal.\u201d\nIsrael\u2019s Government Directly Pays for Abortions: In the United States, even most Democrats do not call for state subsidies for abortion and numerous other reproductive healthcare options."}
