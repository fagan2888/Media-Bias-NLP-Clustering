2016 Tax Season May be a Nightmare

Many taxpayers might think what's bad for the IRS is good for them. But tax preparers say the Obama administration has gutted customer service and if you think last year's tax season was bad, you ain't seen nothin' yet.

Houston CPA Michael Parmet says frustrated taxpayers will throw up their hands and just skip filing.

"We're starting to get into a position with the IRS that we're losing voluntary compliance."

Parmet says that'll put us on the road to a financial meltdown like Greece.

"All taxpayers eventually will be paying more taxes because there is no compliance and people know they can get away with anything."

Parmet says the administration has squandered IRS money on Obamacare enforcement and spent too much fighting identity theft.

"We're getting to a point where the people are saying 'I can't get any help from the IRS. They're not trying to help me.' They're saying after six months, 'they sent me a letter saying it'll be another three months to respond to my letter where they accuse me of not paying my taxes.'"
