House Democrats\u2019 continued support for this failed attempt at health care reform hurts their constituents and they will be forced to answer for it in November.\u201d National Republican Congressional Committee spokesman Bob Salera said in a statement.\n\nFollow Juliegrace Brufke on Twitter\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
