The FCC\u2019s handling of spectrum use around the auction will put wireless hospital devices \u2014 fetal-heart monitors, trackers on Alzheimer\u2019s patients and the like \u2014 at risk for interference from others placed very near it, the American Hospital Association says. Hospitals already have a dedicated channel to use for such devices, Channel 37, but the FCC is endangering that by crowding the space with new wireless broadcasting, the AHA says. They continue to plead with the commission and Congress for help.\n\n\u2014 But wireless companies say the upcoming spectrum auction \u2014 expected to generate billions in revenue \u2014 will greatly benefit the growing world of health gadgets and remote health monitoring devices. The broadcast airwaves up for sale are the beachfront property of spectrum \u2013 finite, highly desirable ways to wirelessly deliver data that can penetrate walls and travel great distances. Companies like Verizon and other tech companies say the additional spectrum could free up uses for round-the-clock monitoring of blood-sugar readings, heart rates and other health data. They\u2019re pushing to keep the March 29 auction on track.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\u2014 The FCC \u2014 and Capitol Hill staffers paying close attention to the auction \u2013 don\u2019t have the knowledge of health care and hospital engineering to fully grasp the fallout of commission\u2019s policies, the Hospital Association says. The health staffers in Congress aren\u2019t the ones working on FCC policies and vice versa. If something goes wrong and new broadcasters interfere with hospital wireless devices, they say, it will put patient lives at risk.

A community-wide health information exchange used by any and all willing participants or one developed by a health system for its affiliated hospitals and doctors? The question is explored in the March issue of The Milbank Quarterly. Both types have challenges, but so-called enterprise HIEs may be better, says the paper. And it\u2019s all about the money. \u201cHealth policymakers might try to encourage the exchange of public information, but the business case for enterprise HIEs clearly is stronger,\u201d the research concludes. \u201cThe sustainability of a community HIE, potentially a public good, may necessitate ongoing public funding and supportive regulation.\u201d The paper: http://bit.ly/1XqaHaV\n\neHealth tweet of the day: @bobkocher: Retweeted OMBPress: Some of the biggest accomplishments of Obama is 18F, USDS, and Health Datapalozza = The Todd Park effect!\n\n@OMBPress: ICYMI .@potus travels to SXSW to make his pitch to America's best & brightest: Help make government work http://wapo.st/1WewH8h\n\nWelcome to Monday morning eHealth where the dorky side of us is celebrating Pi Day, 3.1416.

The large number of new codes is due to the fact that updates weren\u2019t allowed prior to last year\u2019s implementation. That and the multiple delays in ICD-10 left a long list of new codes waiting to be added, according to the American Hospital Association.\n\nUPDATE ON REMOVING SOCIALS FROM MEDICARE: Per last year\u2019s Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act, CMS will start issuing new Medicare cards in April 2018 with a new Medicare billing identifier, HIMSS is telling its members. MACRA requires CMS to remove Social Security number-based IDs from cards, to cut down on identify theft. \u201cAll systems and business processes will need to be able to accept and process transactions using the new MBI by April 2018,\u201d HIMSS says. Over 60 million Medicare cards with the new identifier will be distributed to beneficiaries between April 2018 and April 2019, says HIMSS.

The first teleconference for the task force is set for Thursday, per HHS\u2019s Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response.

Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse is pushing for the meaningful use pilot. \u201cAs he\u2019s seen in Rhode Island and elsewhere, leaving behavioral health providers out of our IT infrastructure makes the challenging task of coordinating care for patients with mental health conditions even more difficult,\u201d his spokesperson tell us.\n\nMACRA OVERSIGHT: The House Energy and Commerce Committee on Thursday will hold a hearing on MACRA implementation.
