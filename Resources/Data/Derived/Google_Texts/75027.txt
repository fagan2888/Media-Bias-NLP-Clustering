MRCTV.org got a chance to catch up with Democratic National Committee Chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz at the first Democratic debate on Tuesday. Among the questions they asked was one relating to abortion.

MRC started off by inquiring about whether she has children. Wasserman Schultz proudly responded, “I do,” and also told of their ages: “twin 16-year-olds and a 12-year-old,” she said.

“In your opinion,” MRC replied, “were they human beings before they were born?”

Quickly understanding where the line of questioning was going, Wasserman Schultz responded with a talking point.

“You know,” she said, “I believe that every woman has the right to make their own reproductive choices.”

“But what did you believe about your children,” MRC pressed.

To which DWS again replied with a talking point about reproductive choices.

Frustrated by her evasiveness, MRC responded, “So were they human beings? Just yes or no.”

“They’re human beings today,” she emphasized, “and I’m glad I had the opportunity to make my own reproductive choices, as – a right that every woman has and should maintain.”

It’s unclear from this video whether Wasserman-Schultz actually falls into the category of people who truly believe that life only begins at birth. Rather, it seems she’s just carefully parroting DNC talking points that cover the full spectrum of pro-choice women. If she does, though, science is definitely not on her side.
