Most are obscure games \u2014 including \u201cWaxing Eyebrows,\u201d \u201cPet Dentist,\u201d \u201cVampire Doctor,\u201d \u201cBounce the Cat\u201d and \u201cAir Fighting 3D\u201d \u2014 but also include utility apps ranging from flashlights to breastfeeding trackers.\n\nThe good news: No popular games, such as Angry Birds, were implicated in Forensiq\u2019s study, which analyzed 16 billion views and tests on its own pool of smartphones.\n\nOnce installed, these apps constantly run \u2014 even when not used \u2014 to stealthily run up to 16,000 ads to generate inflated but false views on industry-used ad-tracking networks. Both Androids and iOS phones are vulnerable. Users generally don\u2019t see these ads running, or may watch one ad while using the app as it or others hidden simultaneously play. And it all goes undetected by current protection software, says Sendroff.\n\nHis advice to protect your phone (and data plan):\n\n* Read reviews before installing apps. Huge red flags include complaints of excessive data usage, drained battery life and/or slower device performance.\n\n* Stick with the popular. There\u2019s no indication that any well-known app or those from trusted vendors are hijacking your phone to run invisible ads.\n\n* Beware of suspicious permissions. \u201cPermissions like the ability to run at startup and keeping the phone from sleeping are rarely needed by apps to perform their intended function,\u201d notes Sendroff.\n\nGet discounts on financial services from trusted companies \u2014 AARP Member Advantages \u00bb\n\n* Disable Internet access to the app in its setting. It\u2019s not needed for most games and prevents ads from being displayed.\n\n* Uninstall apps you don\u2019t use. \u201cWe believe that a lot of the fraudulent traffic is coming from users who installed apps and forgot they are still present on their phone or tablet.\u201d Industry stats suggest that after being installed, 1 in 4 apps are never used.\n\nFor information about other scams, sign up for the Fraud Watch Network.
