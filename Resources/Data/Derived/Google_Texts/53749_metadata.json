Barack Obama, \u201cwould you be willing to meet separately, without precondition, during the first year of your administration, in Washington or anywhere else, with the leaders of Iran, Syria, Venezuela, Cuba and North Korea, in order to bridge the gap that divides our countries?\u201d To everyone\u2019s shock, Obama said he would, and that \u201cthat the notion that somehow not talking to countries is punishment to them--which has been the guiding diplomatic principle of this administration--is ridiculous.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nThe response was slammed as \u201cirresponsible and frankly naive\u201d by Hillary Clinton campaign. Republicans were even harsher. But rather than backtrack, Obama doubled down on the idea, saying during a later one-on-one debate with Hillary Clinton that \u201cit's important for the United States not just to talk to its friends, but also to talk to its enemies. In fact, that's where diplomacy makes the biggest difference.\u201d My now-colleague Matthew Yglesias argued in the Atlantic in 2008 that it was this early \u201cgaffe\u201d that helped Obama discover his distinctive voice on foreign policy.\n\nThe thing is, it never really happened, either in Obama\u2019s first year or any point afterward. Obama did \u201cgreet\u201d Hugo Chavez at a summit in 2009, and received some reading material, but there was never an official meeting with the late Venezuelan leader or his successor, Nicolas Maduro. There\u2019s been some low-level thawing of diplomatic relations with Cuba, but nothing close to a meeting between Obama and either Castro brother. Same story with both Kims. There was movement to normalize relations with Syria during the first term, but generally with then Sen. John Kerry acting as intermediary.\n\nOf course, at the time, the question was really about Iran, and its bellicose president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. Obama has recorded yearly Nowruz messages aimed at the Iranian public, but never a sit-down with Ahmadinejad or anything close to it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nNow, it appears, with a new president in Tehran, the U.S.-Iranian presidential meeting that Obama said he was open to in 2007 might actually happen:\n\nWhite House spokesman Jay Carney has deflected questions all week about whether the two leaders would meet during the U.N. gathering. On Thursday, he acknowledged a change in tone between Iran and the West since Rouhani took office and said a meeting was possible, though one was not scheduled. \"It's possible, but it has always been possible,\" Carney said. \"The extended hand has been there from the moment the president was sworn in.\"\n\nThe meeting in question would probably be more along the lines of the brief Chavez encounter. But with Rouhani making all the right noises in advance of the U.N. summit this week, a more formalized summit seems more plausible than it ever did in the Ahmadinejad days.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.tags": "will obama meet with the presient of iran, obama rouhani meeting, obama administration diplomacy, obama meet with america\u2019s enemies", "sailthru.author": "Joshua Keating", "description": "In this season of off-the-cuff statements that turn out to have wide-ranging diplomatic consequences, it\u2019s worth thinking back to the ur-substantive ga ...", "og": {"site_name": "Slate Magazine", "description": "In this season of off-the-cuff statements that turn out to have wide-ranging diplomatic consequences, it\u2019s worth thinking back to the ur-substantive ga ...", "title": "It Took Six Years, but Obama Might Finally Sit Down With One of \u201cAmerica\u2019s Enemies\u201d", "url": "http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_world_/2013/09/20/obama_may_meet_iran_s_president_is_this_finally_the_foreign_policy_we_were.html", "image": "http://www.slate.com/content/dam/slate/blogs/the_world_/2013/09/20/obama_may_meet_iran_s_president_is_this_finally_the_foreign_policy_we_were/75607766.jpg.CROP.cq5dam_web_1280_1280_jpeg.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "In this season of off-the-cuff statements that turn out to have wide-ranging diplomatic consequences, it\u2019s worth thinking back to the ur-substantive ga ...", "creator": "@joshuakeating", "url": "http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_world_/2013/09/20/obama_may_meet_iran_s_president_is_this_finally_the_foreign_policy_we_were.html", "image": "http://www.slate.com/content/dam/slate/blogs/the_world_/2013/09/20/obama_may_meet_iran_s_president_is_this_finally_the_foreign_policy_we_were/75607766.jpg.CROP.cq5dam_web_1280_1280_jpeg.jpg", "title": "It Took Six Years, but Obama Might Finally Sit Down With One of \u201cAmerica\u2019s Enemies\u201d<strong></strong>", "site": "@slate", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2013-09-20T11:53:51Z", "sailthru.promoheadline": "It Took Six Years, but Obama Might Finally Sit Down With One of \u201cAmerica\u2019s Enemies\u201d", "sailthru.headline": "It Took Six Years, but Obama Might Finally Sit Down With One of \u201cAmerica\u2019s Enemies\u201d", "fb": {"app_id": 142011022527753}, "parsely-page": "{\n  \"title\": \"It Took Six Years, but Obama Might Finally Sit Down With One of \\u201cAmerica\\u2019s Enemies\\u201d\",\n  \"link\": \"http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_world_/2013/09/20/obama_may_meet_iran_s_president_is_this_finally_the_foreign_policy_we_were.html\",\n  \"image_url\": \"http://www.slate.com/content/dam/slate/blogs/the_world_/2013/09/20/obama_may_meet_iran_s_president_is_this_finally_the_foreign_policy_we_were/75607766.jpg.CROP.thumbnail-small.jpg\",\n  \"type\": \"post\",\n  \"post_id\": \"236130920001\",\n  \"pub_date\": \"2013-09-20T11:53:51Z\",\n  \"section\": \"News and Politics\",\n  \"author\": \"Joshua Keating\",\n  \"tags\": [\n    \"barack obama\",\n    \"diplomacy\",\n    \"iran\",\n    \"hassan rouhani\",\n    \"international\",\n    \"politics\"\n  ]\n}", "fb-share": "It Took Six Years, but Obama Might Finally Sit Down With One of \u201cAmerica\u2019s Enemies\u201d", "tw-line": "It Took Six Years, but Obama Might Finally Sit Down With One of \u201cAmerica\u2019s Enemies\u201d", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/Slate"}, "keywords": "will obama meet with the presient of iran, obama rouhani meeting, obama administration diplomacy, obama meet with america\u2019s enemies", "google-site-verification": "jXqoqqPSmx_PWchRdG-IXu-X616Ee2Ptf_AiElI9LzQ", "sailthru.description": "In this season of off-the-cuff statements that turn out to have wide-ranging diplomatic consequences, it\u2019s worth thinking back to the ur-substantive ga ...", "sailthru.image.full": "http://www.slate.com/content/dam/slate/blogs/the_world_/2013/09/20/obama_may_meet_iran_s_president_is_this_finally_the_foreign_policy_we_were/75607766.jpg.CROP.cq5dam_web_1280_1280_jpeg.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcdaf9\"", "article_summary": "Of course, at the time, the question was really about Iran, and its bellicose president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.\nPhoto by STAN HONDA/AFP/Getty ImagesIn this season of off-the-cuff statements that turn out to have wide-ranging diplomatic consequences, it\u2019s worth thinking back to the ur-substantive gaffe of the Obama administration\u2019s foreign policy.\nThere\u2019s been some low-level thawing of diplomatic relations with Cuba, but nothing close to a meeting between Obama and either Castro brother.\nObama has recorded yearly Nowruz messages aimed at the Iranian public, but never a sit-down with Ahmadinejad or anything close to it.\nThe meeting in question would probably be more along the lines of the brief Chavez encounter."}
