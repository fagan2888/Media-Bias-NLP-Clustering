Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544 (2007) and Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662 (2009) applies to affirmative defenses. See Exclusively Cats Veterinary Hospital, P.C. v. Pharmaceutical Credit Corp., No. 13-14376, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 132440 (E.D. Mich. Sept. 22, 2014).\n\nAlthough there is a split of authority in the district courts and no authority from the circuit courts, most courts and commentators have concluded that affirmative defenses need not satisfy the plausibility standard articulated in Twombly and Iqbal. They have reasoned that the standard should be different because the rules are different; whereas those pleading a claim for relief must make a \u201cshowing that the pleader is entitled to relief,\u201d those pleading a defense or affirmative defense must only \u201cstate in short and plain terms its defenses\u201d and \u201caffirmatively state any avoidance or affirmative defense.\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2) (claims), 8(b)(1)(A) (defenses), 8(c)(1) (affirmative defenses). Because the Supreme Court\u2019s discussion of the plausibility standard hinged on the requirement that claims be \u201cshown,\u201d and because affirmative defenses can be \u201cstated\u201d without being \u201cshown,\u201d most courts have found that affirmative defenses should not be held to that higher standard. Some have also explained that the Supreme Court\u2019s concerns about \u201cunlock[ing] the doors of discovery for a plaintiff armed with nothing more than conclusions\u201d do not apply to affirmative defenses because the plaintiff has already unlocked those doors himself. Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678-79. Others have noted that it would be unfair to hold defendants to a plausibility standard because whereas plaintiffs may file their complaints after months or even years of investigation, defendants must file their answers within 21 days. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(a)(1)(A).\n\nThe Exclusively Cats court began by acknowledging that district courts within the Sixth Circuit have split on this issue. See Exclusively Cats, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 132440 at *4 (citingSafeco Ins. Co. of Am. v. O\u2019Hara Corp., No. 08-10545, 2008 WL 2558015, at *1 (E.D. Mich. June 25, 2008) (applying plausibility standard to affirmative defenses); Int\u2019l Outdoor, Inc. v. City of Southgate, No. 11-14719, 2012 WL 2367160, at *7-9 (E.D. Mich. Apr. 6, 2012) (declining to do so)). It then sided with the majority view and explained that Rules 8(b) and 8(c) contain \u201cno language similar to that of Rule 8(a).\u201d Id. at *5. It also reasoned that the policy of containing discovery costs was not enough to tip the scales in the opposite direction. Id. Finally, it noted that its holding was consistent with a number of Sixth Circuit decisions\u2014both before and after Twombly and Iqbal\u2014that suggested that affirmative defenses can be stated in general terms. Id. at *3-4 (citing Lawrence v. Chabot, 182 F. App\u2019x 442, 456-57 (6th Cir. 2006) (\u201cAn affirmative defense may be pleaded in general terms and will be held to be sufficient \u2026 as long as it gives plaintiff fair notice of the nature of the defense\u201d); Davis v. Sun Oil Co., 148 F.3d 606, 612 (6th Cir. 1998) (holding that an affirmative defense that \u201cclaims are barred by the doctrine of res judicata\u201d was sufficient under Rule 8(c)); Montgomery v. Wyeth , 580 F.3d 455, 468 (6th Cir. 2009) (holding that \u201c[t]he Federal Rules of Civil Procedure do not require a heightened pleading standard for a statute of repose defense\u201d and citing Rule 8(b)(2)\u2019s requirement that a party \u201cstate in short and plain terms its defenses to each claim\u201d).\n\nHowever, the court did grant the plaintiff\u2019s requested relief with respect to two affirmative defenses. First, it held that simply stating that claims \u201care barred, in whole, or in part by 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 227(b)(1)(C) et seq.\u201d was insufficient because it did not specify which statutory provision allegedly barred the plaintiff\u2019s claim. Exclusively Cats, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 132440, at *5-6. Second, it struck a mitigation of damages defense because the plaintiff did not \u201cseek actual damages exceeding the statutory amount.\u201d Id. at *13-14. But it held that affirmative defenses such as consent, established business relationship, and unclean hands were appropriately raised and properly pleaded.
