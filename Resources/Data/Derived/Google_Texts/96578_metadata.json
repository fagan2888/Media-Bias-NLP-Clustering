Eastern Time (come to Reason.com for live blogging and tweeting), here's something he can chew on: Pew Research asked Americans to sum him up in one word.\n\nThe most popular choices? \"Good/Good man\" and \"Incompetent.\" Intelligent is well represented as is \"idiot/dumb/stupid,\" honest, dictator, liar, awesome, and arrogant.\n\nIn the interest of #realkeeping, George W. Bush was viewed similarly at this point in his presidency:\n\nAt a comparable point in his presidency, incompetent, arrogant andhonest were frequently used descriptions of George W. Bush. Bush\u2019s approval rating was lower than Obama\u2019s (33% for Bush then, 47% for Obama today) and negative terms were used more frequently to describe him.\n\nWhich seems about right.\n\nWhile most of us will be tuning out tonight's speech, Jack Shafer, now writing at Politico, says the annual speech \"isn't completely useless.\" It's the only speech a prez can expect all the networks to cover, writes Shafer, and there's this:\n\nAccording to research conducted by political scientists Donna R. Hoffman and Alison D. Howard, about 40 percent of the requests a president makes in a State of the Union speech are enacted in some form as law\u2014a batting average the major leagues haven\u2019t seen since Ted Williams. Perhaps presidents have inflated their batting averages by including sure-bet legislative proposals in addresses, but the addresses still frame the White House\u2019s intentions, clarify the direction the president\u2019s budget will take, focus press corps coverage, and help structure the legislative agenda. Language about an issue into the State of the Union also has a tendency to increase the public\u2019s sense of urgency about it. One study of addresses from 1946 to 2003 found that every 50 words devoted by a president to an issue resulted in a 2 percentage point increase (sometimes temporary) in the public\u2019s identification of the issue as America\u2019s most important problem. Laugh if you want to, but political revolutions are won by 2 percentage point swings, even temporary ones.\n\nRead the whole thing.\n\nAccording to Veronique de Rugy's tally here last Friday, Obama batted considerably lower that .400 when it comes to last year's SOTU. Indeed, very few of his proposals became a reality (that's a good thing).
