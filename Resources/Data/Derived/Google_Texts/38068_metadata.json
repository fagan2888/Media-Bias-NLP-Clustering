Franklin Graham claimed that the president \u201cwas \u2018fundamentally mistaken\u2019 about radical Islam . . . and argued that Islam \u2018is a false religion\u2019 and that \u2018it is impossible for a false religion to be a true religion of peace.\u2019\u201d\n\nWho\u2019s right?\n\nLet\u2019s start with some simple math.\n\nRecent surveys indicate that the Muslim population in America is slightly under one percent, so, to be generous, let\u2019s use one percent as the figure, which would mean that roughly three million Americans are Muslim. (Oddly enough, the MuslimPopulation.com website claims that 2.11 percent of Americans are Muslims, supporting this with a reference to a Wikipedia article that puts the figure at 0.8 percent!)\n\nAccording to President Obama, this figure of three million Muslims would make us \u201cone of the biggest Muslim nations.\u201d\n\nWas he accurate? Not by a mile. Not by many, many miles. In fact, he was embarrassingly wrong and inaccurate.\n\nHere\u2019s the list of the top 10 countries with more Muslims than America (as of 2012, with figures rounded off): 1). Indonesia 209 million; 2). India 177 million; 3). Pakistan 167 million; 4). Bangladesh 134 million; 5). Nigeria 77 million; 6). Egypt 77 million; 7). Iran 74 million; 8). Turkey 71 million; 9). Algeria 35 million; 10). Morocco 32 million.\n\nHow big is America\u2019s Muslim population looking right now? How does 3 million compare with 209 million of 177 million?\n\nUzbekistan, number 15 on the list, has 27 million Muslims; little Yemen, number 17, has 24 million; China, number 18, has 23 million, and Russia, number 21, has 16 million, more than 5 times our national total.\n\nWhat was the president thinking?\n\nIn terms of world Islamic populations, America is about 38th on the list, meaning that we have one of the smaller Muslim populations worldwide, despite the size of our country.\n\nThe president\u2019s error, then, would be akin to a stating that the United States was one of the world\u2019s oldest civilizations. Not quite!\n\nSeeing, then, that Mr. Obama was so grossly wrong in his assessment of our Muslim population (again, a matter of simple math), can he be trusted in his assessment of Islam in general?\n\nRev. Graham said, \u201cI . . . believe our president is completely and fundamentally mistaken about the intolerant and violent nature of hardened Islamic followers.\u201d\n\nSo who is more accurate when it comes to the nature of Islam itself?\n\nWithout a doubt, there are tens of millions of peace-loving Muslims worldwide, including many American Muslims.\n\nAnd without a doubt, there are Muslim theologians and political leaders who deplore the actions of groups like ISIS and Boko Haram.\n\nThis means that we make a serious mistake when we demonize all Muslims and treat them as if they were murderous terrorists.\n\nIn that respect, yes, we need to be better educated regarding Islam. Absolutely.\n\nAt the same time, it cannot be denied that large Islamic countries like Pakistan and Iran mistreat and persecute Christians (especially those who convert from Islam), sometimes to the point of death; that countries like Saudi Arabia and Afghanistan allow no true religious freedom for other faiths; and that there are a multiplicity of substantial terrorist groups using the Koran for justification, in glaring contrast with Christianity worldwide.\n\nMore importantly, even if 80-90 percent of Muslims are not radicals, this means absolutely nothing in terms of our recognition of the very real dangers posed by radical Islam. After all, what percentage of Germans were Nazis? If the large numbers don\u2019t prevent the small numbers from taking murderous action, why does that matter?\n\nAnd should we snivel at a figure of, at the very least, 150 million radical Muslims worldwide?\n\nWhat our president should be doing is recognizing the tremendous dangers posed by radical Islam and making every effort to ensure that our nation is addressing these dangers both here and abroad. (This includes not calling blatant Islamic terror attacks \u201cworkplace violence.\u201d)\n\nTo paraphrase what I\u2019ve said before, while here in the West we are putting our heads in the sand, in other parts of the world, the heads of the victims of radical Islam are rolling in the sand.", "article_metadata": {"description": "According to President Obama, this figure of three million Muslims would make us one of the biggest Muslim nations.
