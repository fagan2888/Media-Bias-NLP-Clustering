Nikki Haley is winnable.\n\n\u201cIt would not surprise me if the two candidates from the 2014 lieutenant governor\u2019s race decided to run for governor in 2018,\u201d said Gibbs Knotts, head of the political science department at the College of Charleston. \u201cHenry McMaster is the sitting lieutenant governor and Bakari Sellers has experience running a statewide campaign.\u201d\n\nOther sources say McMaster, a Republican, is happy being lieutenant governor and Sellers, a Democrat who may be eyeing 2018, also is interested in serving in Congress should Sixth District U.S. Rep. Jim Clyburn decide to retire.\n\nMany suggest that two-term Republican Attorney General Alan Wilson is the hands-on favorite for now for Republicans. Why? Because he\u2019s vigorously opposed several hot-button big issues, such as Obamacare and gay marriage, by joining federal lawsuits.\n\nKnotts said it would not be surprising if a current member of Congress decided to try to become governor. \u201cIt is possible, though not likely, that U.S. Sen. Tim Scott could run in 2018,\u201d he said.\n\nOthers point to GOP Congressman Mick Mulvaney of the Rock Hill area. He\u2019s got a harder edge, they say. And early front-runners often lose in primaries, one insider suggested.\n\nAlso mentioned as possibilities to top the 2018 GOP ticket are U.S. Rep. Jeff Duncan, state Treasurer Curtis Loftis, former state Department of Health and Environmental Control head Catherine Templeton and (wait for it) former Gov. and current U.S. Rep. Mark Sanford. Update: Also reportedly considering a race is House Speaker Pro Tem Tommy Pope, R-York.\n\nOn the Democratic side besides Sellers, two popular officials often also are mentioned: Columbia Mayor Steve Benjamin and state Rep. James Smith, also of Columbia. Both have put in long years in party politics, but are relatively young and would bring fresh approaches, observers suggest.\n\nWhat will it take to win?\n\nAt this point, the state is likely to vote in a Republican in 2018 because South Carolina is deeply red, Knotts said.\n\n\u201cWhoever gets the Republican nomination will have a tremendous advantage,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is not impossible for a Democrat to win, but a Republican starts with a big head start.\u201d\n\nLouis Jacobson, a Washington columnist with Politico, observed this week that Republicans seem to have an advantage in gubernatorial elections in mid-term elections, which is what would happen in 2018. And that is borne out in data \u2014 currently there are 31 GOP governors, 18 Democrats and one independent.\n\n\u201cMid-term electorates tend to be smaller, whiter, older and more Republican,\u201d Jacobson wrote. \u201cPresidential electorates tend to be larger, more demographically diverse and more Democratic.\u201d\n\nFor a Republican to become governor in 2018 in South Carolina, pushing what\u2019s already been successful \u2014 jobs, jobs, jobs \u2014 is what voters likely will hear.\n\n\u201cThe winning formula for Republicans has been a low-tax, fiscally-conservative, job-friendly agenda,\u201d Knotts said. \u201cI would continue that approach. Demographic shifts will make it increasingly difficult for Republicans to take far right positions on social issues, however.\u201d\n\nDemocrats, who last won the governorship in 1998, will have a tougher time, he said.\n\n\u201cThey would need to unite a coalition of minority voters and women. Education and health care could be issues that help Democrats.\u201d\n\nOne insider cautioned that if a Democrat becomes president in 2016, it would be harder in South Carolina for a Democrat to become governor because of how elections have become nationalized. In other words, the GOP at a national level would heap criticism on a Democratic president, which would drive issues in any gubernatorial race.\n\nBut if a Republican becomes president in 2016, the same logic would benefit Democratic candidates in the Palmetto State. They would be able to highlight GOP problems at a national level in statewide campaigns.\n\nA key Democratic operative observed: \u201cWe have to ride a positive wave if we are going to win. They can have a bad national wave and they can still win.\u201d\n\nElection Day 2018 is 1,201 days away.", "article_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "generator": "WPZOOM Framework 1.5.0"}, "article_summary": "But if a Republican becomes president in 2016, the same logic would benefit Democratic candidates in the Palmetto State.\nOn the Democratic side besides Sellers, two popular officials often also are mentioned: Columbia Mayor Steve Benjamin and state Rep.
