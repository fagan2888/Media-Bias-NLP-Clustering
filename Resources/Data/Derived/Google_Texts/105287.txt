The 68-year-old former presidential candidate will face off against the former heavyweight champion of the world for a good cause: CharityVision, a nonprofit that provides surgery for people with vision-related issues in developing countries. NPR reports the former Utah governor observed the charity's work firsthand on a recent visit to India and was very moved by their mission. (His son Josh is the part-time volunteer president of the organization.)

According to his interview with the New York Times, Romney has given some thought to his nascent boxing career: He says his boxing nickname is "The Glove," and he'd like his entrance music to be "I Will Survive." His son brought him a red silk robe and shorts to wear in the ring.

In what is probably a first for the boxing world, Romney says he "will get in Holyfield's face with compliments and good humor." (Is that how Mormons think trash talk works?)

The event is expected to raise $1 million for charity. No reports yet as to whether Barack Obama has reserved ringside seats -- though Romney told the Times that if he wins, he wants his next match to be against Harry Reid.
