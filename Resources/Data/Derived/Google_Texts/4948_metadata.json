See the report: http://1.usa.gov/25Of067\n\nICYMI: GALLUP SAYS UNINSURED RATE AT RECORD LOW \u2014 The uninsured rate among all adults was 11 percent in the first quarter of 2016, a slight decline from 11.9 percent in the fourth quarter of 2015, according to Gallup data released Thursday. It's the lowest level since Gallup and Healthways began tracking the uninsured rate in 2008.\n\n\u2014 A tale of three Americas. The Gallup data continues to show that the uninsured rate remains dramatically different among adults of different ethnic subgroups. According to Gallup, the uninsured rate for adults who are:\n\nWhite: 6.4 percent\n\nBlack: 11.4 percent\n\nHispanic: 28.3 percent\n\nSee the Gallup data: http://bit.ly/1Nc8nie\n\nBUT SAFETY-NET EFFORTS ARE STILL NECESSARY \u2014 That's according to new research from Georgetown University's Center on Health Insurance Reforms, which concludes that charity care programs are still playing essential roles. Researchers found that even though the programs received fewer patients after open-enrollment season, many returned later in the year because they dropped exchange coverage.\n\n\"What was not anticipated was how many people who are eligible for marketplace plans with subsidies, and even those who are enrolled, still need help,\" co-author JoAnn Volk told POLITICO's Paul Demko. More here.\n\nCA EXCHANGE CLEARS WAY FOR UNDOCUMENTED COVERAGE WAIVER \u2014 The California exchange on Thursday moved to send ACA \u201cSection 1332\u201d waiver proposals to the state legislature, including a request to let undocumented immigrants purchase unsubsidized plans on the state-run marketplace, Pro's Rachana Pradhan reports.\n\nThe California legislature still needs to pass a bill authorizing the state to submit an application to the federal government, where approval is uncertain even under a Democratic administration. However, some board members indicated the concept was the right one to support. \u201cI haven\u2019t been shy about making clear that this is somewhat symbolic,\u201d California HHS Secretary Diana Dooley said during a board meeting. But she added, \u201cI do understand that symbolism is important.\u201d\n\n\u2026 Covered California also approved a novel plan to identify \u2014 and possibly ban \u2014 providers that provide poor-quality or unjustifiably high-cost care. By 2018, insurers will identify poor performing providers, who could be excluded from exchange plan networks as early as 2019. The exchange will also adopt a payment system intended to link at least 6 percent of hospital reimbursement risk or subject to bonuses based on quality.\n\nDetails on the new health insurer contract terms: http://bit.ly/1Vcauup\n\nMedPAC PART D RECS RILE PhRMA, PLEASE GPhA \u2014 The Medicare Payment Advisory Commission approved a slate of recommendations Thursday that irked PhRMA, Pro's Brett Norman reports.\n\nWhat MedPAC wants\n\n\u2014 MedPAC would lower the government\u2019s share of Part D reinsurance subsidies, after reinsurance spending in the program has grown 20 percent annually in recent years. MedPAC would also have Congress eliminate cost-sharing for beneficiaries who have blown through their out-of-pocket cap, and wants to no longer count some drugmaker discounts toward that cap.\n\n\u2014 The commission would lower co-pays for the low-income subsidy population for generic drugs to encourage broader use of the cheaper products.\n\n\u2014 And it would remove the requirement that plans cover virtually every anti-depressant and anti-transplant rejection product as \u201cprotected classes\u201d in Part D.\n\nHow industry reacted\n\nPhRMA says: \u201cTaken together, these recommendations will significantly harm beneficiaries by eroding coverage and protections for some of the most vulnerable enrollees in the program. MedPAC\u2019s vote also ignores broad stakeholder concerns raised in response to these proposals.\u201d\n\nBut GPhA cheered the recommendation on generics, which are used less often by low-income beneficiaries. That lagging rate is \u201cparticularly troublesome because, as patients who fall below 135 percent of the poverty line, the [low-income-subsidy] population is particularly vulnerable to lapses in medication adherence due to inability to pay out-of-pocket costs,\u201d Christine Simmon, GPhA\u2019s SVP for policy, said in a statement.\n\nPART B PROPOSAL: BAD FOR OUTPATIENT DEPARTMENTS, GOOD FOR PRIMARY CARE \u2014 That's according to a new Avalere analysis of CMS's controversial proposal to change how it pays for physician-administered drugs.\n\n\u201cWe have found that $480 is the tipping point for how Part B drug reimbursement would change under this new rule,\u201d Avalere's Adam Borden said in a statement. \u201cPhysicians who prescribe drugs that cost more would receive lower Medicare payments.\u201d\n\nThe change would mostly hit hospital outpatient departments, which would account for 60 percent of payment reductions if the proposal was implemented nationwide. In contrast, primary care providers and orthopedic surgeons would be among those groups that stand to gain.\n\nSee the analysis: http://bit.ly/1SDUuv3\n\nPORTMAN PRESSURES HOUSE ON CARA \u2014 Sen. Rob Portman, one of the authors of the Senate's opioid bill, is trying to pressure the House to act on his bill, which was approved by the Senate about a month ago.\n\n\"Every day, we lose about 120 Americans to drug overdoses. That means that we\u2019ve lost more than 3,240 Americans since the Senate passed this bill,\" Portman said on the Senate floor Thursday. \"Let me just say to my friends in the House, respectfully, the Senate has made your job a lot easier. We have already done the hard part.\u201d\n\nTENET DROPPED FROM S&P 500 \u2014 The for-profit hospital company has seen its stock slide after losing $140 million last year. Why the downturn? Blame a major settlement under the False Claims Act and dwindling returns from ACA coverage expansion.\n\nKFF's ALTMAN ON HEALTH CARE AND THE CAMPAIGN \u2014 Writing in the Wall Street Journal, Kaiser Family Foundation CEO Drew Altman discusses new data on how \"health care\" issues \u2014 which include reproductive health, rising drug costs and more \u2014 are playing in this year's presidential election. For example, 44 percent of Republican women say that health care issues are \"extremely important\" to their vote.\n\n\"It\u2019s likely that the gender gap on health as a voting issue will carry over to the general election, with women forming the bloc of voters who feel strongest about health-care issues,\" Altman predicts. He adds that candidates' competing ideas about the future of Medicare could potentially \"drown out other health issues and activate senior voters.\"\n\nRead the column: http://on.wsj.com/1TEXcp8\n\nWHY IT'S HARD TO BE FLUENT WITH PATIENT-GENERATED DATA \u2014 The National Quality Forum delved into patient engagement and patient-generated data at its annual meeting Thursday \u2014 and found there are so many new forms of patient-generated data that there isn\u2019t yet a common language about it.\n\nOne interesting element flagged by POLITICO health editor Joanne Kenen \u2014 who moderated the panel \u2014 was how masses and masses of data are being gathered and then sliced, diced, analyzed and marketed by data brokers. (Not everyone agreed on its importance or priority for health care, however.) That trove of information about so many aspects of our lives can also reveal a lot about social determinants of health and risk factors for individuals within a patient population. Brad Bowman of Healthgrades said it\u2019s already being used by hospital marketing departments.\n\nWhich prompted us to ask \u2014 if it\u2019s being used to make hospitals richer, shouldn\u2019t it be used to make us healthier?\n\nTHE STORY OF THE WEEK \u2026 is this ProPublica investigation into New York's lax regulations for how nurses are vetted and disciplined. Unlike many states, New York doesn't require applicants for nursing licenses to undergo simple background checks or submit fingerprints. Within hours of the story, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said he'd consider changing the law.\n\nRead ProPublica's story: http://bit.ly/1Xko50C\n\nON TAP NEXT WEEK \u2014 The House Ways and Means Committee on Thursday will hold a hearing on how health tax expenditures affect cost, access, choice and portability in the health care system.\n\nWHAT WE'RE READING\n\nImagine having your baby switched in the hospital. It briefly happened to a former POLITICO reporter recently: http://wapo.st/1oHwE9D\n\nBig California firms are taking on a local health system over its high cost of care, and it could be a precedent-setting legal battle, Chad Terhune reports: http://n.pr/20cQQOC\n\nEffective, cutting-edge drugs and low costs? We can't have it all when it comes to pharmaceutical innovation, Austin Frakt argues at the JAMA Forum: http://bit.ly/23h0a9c\n\nThe controversial head of Google's biotech venture awarded a major contract \u2026 to a luxury clinic that he owns: http://bit.ly/1SUbD6r\n\nWhat surgeons say when they don't think their patient is listening: http://wapo.st/1YibHyp\n\n** A message from National Community Pharmacists Association (NCPA): While approximately 80 percent of prescription drugs dispensed are generic drugs, the reimbursement system for these medications is largely unregulated and a mystery to pharmacists and patients. The lack of transparency also raises questions as to whether drug plan middlemen, pharmacy benefit manager (PBM) corporations, are overpaid by Medicare and other federal health programs. Moreover, when generic drug prices spike, PBM corporations are slow to update reimbursement rates, leaving community pharmacies with payments that don\u2019t cover costs and unsustainable financial losses. H.R. 244 would increase transparency and facilitate timely payment updates.
