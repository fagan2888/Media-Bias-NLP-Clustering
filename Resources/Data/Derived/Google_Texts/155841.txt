A man is dead after being hit by a train in North Austin. It happened around 8p.m. Saturday.

First responders found a body near the Arbor Walk shopping center at 9416 Neils Thompson Drive.

Police say a white male in his 3o’s was sitting near the tracks when he was hit by a Union Pacific train heading north.

According to the train’s conductor, the man was sitting next to the train tracks with his back facing west and got up to begin walking north as the train approached.

The conductor told police he was unsure if the horn was blown, saying the incident happened too fast.

“They said it was about three car lengths away when they actually saw him,” said APD Corporal Shane Duprey. “They didn’t have time to stop and when they do it takes a long time for them to stop.”

The train came to a hault just before Braker Lane which is about a half mile away from where the man was hit. Police say the man’s body was thrown roughly 50 feet, and he was wearing a backpack when he was struck. The man was pronounced dead on the scene.

Homicide investigators are now trying to determine if the man was homeless and whether this incident was a suicide.
