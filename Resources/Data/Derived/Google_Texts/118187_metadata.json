This according to new research from the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC).\n\n\u201cThese updated projections confirm that the physician shortage is real, it\u2019s significant, and the nation must begin to train more doctors now if patients are going to be able to receive the care they need,\u201d AAMC President and CEO Darrell Kirch said in a statement.\n\nWhile the doctor shortage has been well documented for years, the report shows that much of the country is in need of primary care physicians partly because of the aging population and because more Americans can now pay for treatment\u2014thanks to the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare.\n\n\u201cThe majority of the reason is demographics,\u201d Janis Orlowski, M.D., Chief Health Care Officer at AAMC tells FOXBusiness.com. \u201cThe number of people over the age of 65 is expected to go up by 40% to 45% within the next 10 years.\u201d\n\nThe Affordable Care Act, which was signed into law in 2010 by President Obama has also caused an increase in demand for more doctors.\n\nContinue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT\n\nBefore Obamacare, reports estimated that 44 million Americans were living without health insurance due to the high costs.\n\n\u201cNow more and more Americans are seeking physicians because they have insurance,\u201d adds Orlowski.\n\nThe study estimates the shortfalls will run as high as 35,600 primary care physicians and 60,300 physicians among non-primary care specialties.\n\nSince 2001, medical schools across the country have been responding to the need by making their class sizes bigger than ever before.\n\n\u201cRight now, medical schools are on par to increase their enrollment by 26%,\u201d says Orlowski, who warns that more still needs to be done.\n\n\u201cMost residency positions are paid for by the federal government but there\u2019s been a freeze on those slot numbers for 20 years,\u201d she adds.\n\nAnd to make matters worse, doctors are burning out more than ever before. Earlier this month, the U.S. Surgeon General, Vivek Murthy spoke about his concerns at the Association of Health Care Journalists annual meeting.\n\n\"The suicide and burnout rate is very high, and this is concerning to me because we're at a point in our country where we need more physicians, not fewer; we need more people entering our profession, not fewer,\" he said. \"If we have people burning out, it really goes against our needs.\u201d\n\nEach year in the U.S., roughly 300-400 physicians die by suicide. Medical students have rates of depression 15% to 30% higher than the general population, according to the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention.\n\nAAMC says it is vital that Congress steps in and increases their federal support for new doctor training.\n\n\u201cIt can take up to 10 years to train a doctor, our nation needs to act now,\u201d says Kirch.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"classification": "/FOX BUSINESS/HEALTH CARE,/FOX BUSINESS/LIFESTYLE AND BUDGET,/FOX BUSINESS/INDUSTRIES/Health Care", "dcterms.modified": "2016-04-20 09:07:17 EDT", "dcterms.abstract": "The U.S. will face a physician shortage over the next decade; potentially as many as 90,000 doctors could be needed.", "twitter": {"url": "http://www.foxbusiness.com/features/2016/04/20/why-u-s-doctor-shortage-is-getting-worse.html", "image": "http://a57.foxnews.com/images.foxnews.com/content/fox-business/features/2016/04/20/why-u-s-doctor-shortage-is-getting-worse/_jcr_content/par/featured-media/media-0.img.jpg/0/0/1461095711941.jpg?ve=1", "description": "The U.S. will face a physician shortage over the next decade; potentially as many as 90,000 doctors could be needed.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Why the U.S. Doctor Shortage is Getting Worse"}, "dc.format": "text/html", "dc.publisher": "Fox Business", "parsely-metadata": "{\"tags\":[\"/FOX BUSINESS/HEALTH CARE\",\"/FOX BUSINESS/LIFESTYLE AND BUDGET\",\"/FOX BUSINESS/INDUSTRIES/Health Care\"],\"author\":\"Jade Scipioni\",\"subSection\":\"features\",\"title\":\"Why the U.S. Doctor Shortage is Getting Worse\",\"image_url\":\"http://a57.foxnews.com/images.foxnews.com/content/fox-business/features/2016/04/20/why-u-s-doctor-shortage-is-getting-worse/_jcr_content/par/featured-media/media-0.img.jpg/0/0/1461095711941.jpg?ve=1\",\"pub_date\":\"2016-04-20T11:30:00Z\",\"link\":\"http://www.foxbusiness.com/features/2016/04/20/why-u-s-doctor-shortage-is-getting-worse.html\",\"type\":\"article\",\"identifier\":\"a33b73cc-58b9-4b4a-8cb4-c6e721f468a4\",\"section\":\"features\"}", "prism.aggregationType": "subsection", "prism.channel": "fbn", "dc.description": "The U.S. will face a physician shortage over the next decade; potentially as many as 90,000 doctors could be needed.", "dc.identifier": "a33b73cc-58b9-4b4a-8cb4-c6e721f468a4", "dc.language": "en-US", "pagetype": "article", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://global.fncstatic.com/static/cq/fb/img/all/mediumtile.png", "classification-isa": "healthcare,lifebudget,healthcare", "description": "The U.S. will face a physician shortage over the next decade; potentially as many as 90,000 doctors could be needed.", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://global.fncstatic.com/static/cq/fb/img/all/widetile.png", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://global.fncstatic.com/static/cq/fb/img/all/smalltile.png", "prism.section": "features", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://global.fncstatic.com/static/cq/fb/img/all/largetile.png", "fb": {"app_id": 116027085089150}, "dc.source": "Fox Business", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "dc.title": "Why The U.s.
