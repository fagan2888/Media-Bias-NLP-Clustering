It works in stop-and-go traffic and on highways. Plus it lets the vehicle park itself.\n\nBut some people may have been using the feature in ways Tesla didn't intend.\n\nAlthough these people say they took safety precautions while recording, in November Tesla's CEO called some of the YouTube videos \"fairly crazy.\" So some restrictions were put in place.\n\nNow autopilot mode is off limits on residential streets and streets without a center divide. Plus the vehicle won't be able to go more than 5 miles per hour over the speed limit.\n\nBut the company also added a feature for drivers. Owners of Tesla Model S or Model X can now \"summon\" their vehicles from up to 39 feet away.\n\nThe beta version of the \"summon feature\" will let the vehicle park in, or back out of, a tight spot with the click of a button or through a smartphone app while you stand by and watch.\n\nOh, and Tesla also wants to help you avoid parking tickets.\n\n\"If Model S detects and imminent ticket it will deploy countermeasures to deter the ticket writer.\"\n\nWe're not so sure about that.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Tesla Motors seems to have backpedaled on its autopilot feature after people posted \"fairly crazy\" videos.", "og": {"site_name": "Newsy", "description": "Tesla Motors seems to have backpedaled on its autopilot feature after people posted \"fairly crazy\" videos.", "title": "Tesla Limits Autopilot Feature After Drivers Do Some Absurd Things", "url": "http://www.newsy.com/videos/tesla-limits-autopilot-feature-after-drivers-do-some-absurd-things/", "image": "http://newsymain.npgroup.netdna-cdn.com/images/videos/m/1452463146.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Tesla Motors seems to have backpedaled on its autopilot feature after people posted \"fairly crazy\" videos.", "title": "Tesla Limits Autopilot Feature After Drivers Do Some Absurd Things", "url": "https://www.newsy.com/videos/tesla-limits-autopilot-feature-after-drivers-do-some-absurd-things/", "image": "https://newsymain-npgroup.netdna-ssl.com/images/videos/m/1452463146.jpg", "site": "@newsyvideos", "player": {"width": 400, "identifier": "https://player.ooyala.com/tframe.html?embedCode=ZyZzE0MDE6ifKKkmcESDcIITOSrTmMgS&pbid=54ea1c2f14ee44369ddf31ac887ffe7e", "height": 225}, "app": {"url": {"ipad": "newsy://55806", "iphone": "newsy://55806", "googleplay": "com.newsy"}, "name": {"ipad": "Newsy: Video News", "iphone": "Newsy: Video News", "googleplay": "Newsy: Multisource Video News"}, "id": {"ipad": 330879884, "iphone": 330879884, "googleplay": "com.newsy"}}, "card": "player"}, "al": {"ios": {"url": "newsy://55806", "app_store_id": 330879884, "app_name": "Newsy: Video News"}}, "msvalidate.01": "675C8D40A5F1E0722AA2D3A33379E884", "fb": {"app_id": 380870506022, "pages": 49978948774}, "google-site-verification": "o36fft0HATmhbZ_GPX4YSOS3EmkTGkPrvNFxQwzcNbY", "keywords": "Tesla Motors,Tesla self-driving car,Tesla autopilot,Tesla autodrive,Tesla updates,Tesla Model S,Tesla Model X,self-driving cars,Tesla \"summon\" feature,Tesla autopark cars,Tesla autopilot feature,updates to autopilot,dangerous videos", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/newsyvideos"}, "thumbnail": "http://newsymain.npgroup.netdna-cdn.com/images/videos/m/1452463146.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=0"}, "article_summary": "Tesla Motors seems to have backpedaled on its autopilot feature after people posted \"fairly crazy\" videos.\nOwners of Tesla Model S or Model X can now \"summon\" their vehicles from up to 39 feet away.\nTesla Motors introduced an autopilot feature for its vehicles in October.\n\"If Model S detects and imminent ticket it will deploy countermeasures to deter the ticket writer.\"\nNow autopilot mode is off limits on residential streets and streets without a center divide."}
