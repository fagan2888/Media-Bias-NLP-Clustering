One hit a passing tractor-trailer truck.\n\nOver the past week, Colorado Department of Transportation crews removed an estimated 400 tons of rock from Glenwood Canyon, mostly from an area 9 miles east of Glenwood Springs.\n\nThey planned to open one lane of I-70 between 4 p.m. and 9 a.m. using pilot car escorts, officials said. Large trucks still will be routed along detours adding up to 146 miles, using U.S. 40 and U.S. 50. Snow expected Monday night may complicate the work.\n\n\u201cThis week will be more about putting in fencing and tie-backs,\u201d CDOT\u2019s northwest region coordinator Dave Eller said.\n\n\u201cWe feel confident we\u2019ve got the large material down and it should be safe if we get the moisture. \u2026 It may be muddy. We don\u2019t anticipate any problems.\u201d\n\nCDOT has hired a contractor to haul away rock, including three large boulders removed on Sunday. On average, 300 vehicles per hour move through Glenwood Canyon.\n\nRock falls threaten travelers along hundreds of miles of roads through Colorado mountains, where freezing and thawing loosens slopes. CDOT has installed barriers along major routes to reduce risk.\n\n\u201cIt is a constant battle,\u201d Eller said. \u201cThere are many locations around the state where there is not netting in place. \u2026 We do our best to mitigate loose rock.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Limited access on I-70 in Glenwood Canyon; pilot cars being used", "title": "Limited access on I-70 in Glenwood Canyon; pilot cars being used", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/02/21/limited-access-on-i-70-in-glenwood-canyon-pilot-cars-being-used/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160219__DP_NGPS_TypeSetExport20160220_A1_CDXXROCKFALLp2.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160219__DP_NGPS_TypeSetExport20160220_A1_CDXXROCKFALLp2.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2016-02-21T18:08:27+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-18T02:21:19+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Traffic"}, "article_summary": "Large trucks still will be routed along detours adding up to 146 miles, using U.S. 40 and U.S. 50.\nOver the past week, Colorado Department of Transportation crews removed an estimated 400 tons of rock from Glenwood Canyon, mostly from an area 9 miles east of Glenwood Springs.\nThey planned to open one lane of I-70 between 4 p.m. and 9 a.m. using pilot car escorts, officials said.\nA slide that loosened boulders as big as small cars pounded I-70 nearly a week ago, forcing the closure.\nWe don\u2019t anticipate any problems.\u201dCDOT has hired a contractor to haul away rock, including three large boulders removed on Sunday."}
