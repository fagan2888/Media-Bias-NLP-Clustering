The panel held its first meeting Sunday.\n\nThe army meanwhile Sunday carried out a second day of air raids on suspected militants in Sinai, witnesses said.\n\nThe army said nine \"radical Islamists\" were killed on Saturday in north Sinai when it launched its air and ground offensive in which nine suspects were also arrested and three arms caches destroyed.\n\nAuthorities describe the security campaigns against both Sinai militants and Islamists across Egypt as a \"war on terrorism\", often lumping in the Brotherhood with jihadists.\n\nAnalyst Karim Bitar warned against the official rhetoric blaming jihadists for unrest in Egypt.\n\nThis is \"dangerous\", he said, because it allows the security forces \"to grant themselves permission to brutally repress\" suspects.\n\nMore than 1,000 people, mostly Morsi backers, have been killed in violence across Egypt since July 3.\n\nAnalysts fear that diehard Morsi supporters, who insist on the legitimacy of their democratically-elected leader, could become radicalised and launch attacks across Egypt.\n\nIn that case Egypt will be caught in a \"vicious circle of repression and political violence,\" said Bitar.\n\nHe expected that the army will continue acting \"as a safeguard\" in Egypt, where security and the economy have been the main challenges since the 2011 uprising that toppled Mubarak.\n\n...,/.,", "article_metadata":
