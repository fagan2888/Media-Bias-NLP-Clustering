But do you really need dental insurance?\n\nIt\u2019s an interesting question, because you can avoid the most likely causes and expenses of dental problems, decay and gum disease, by brushing your teeth and flossing diligently. \u201cThe cheapest cavity is the one you never get,\u201d Cleveland dentist Matt Messina tells U.S. News & World Report.\n\nThe Price of Insurance\n\nAbout 61% of Americans have dental insurance. Nearly all of them have coverage through work or a group plan like AARP\u2019s, Medicaid, Tricare (for military families) and the federal Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program, wrote Evelyn Ireland, executive director of the National Association of Dental Plans, in an email interview.\n\nMost dental preferred provider organization and regular insurance (indemnity) plans have an average deductible of $50 and a maximum yearly benefit of $1,000, Ireland says. Only 2% to 4% of Americans with dental insurance use up their yearly maximum allowance.\n\nDental plans offered through a workplace typically are one of three types:\n\nIndemnity plan. You choose your provider of choice, and your plan pays a percentage of the fees.\n\nYou choose your provider of choice, and your plan pays a percentage of the fees. PPO. Preferred provider organization plans have groups of practitioners who agree to reduced fees for patients within the network. Your costs are lower with network dentists. You may see out-of-network dentists, but it\u2019ll cost you more.\n\nPreferred provider organization plans have groups of practitioners who agree to reduced fees for patients within the network. Your costs are lower with network dentists. You may see out-of-network dentists, but it\u2019ll cost you more. HMO. Health maintenance organizations cut costs by requiring members to use only providers within the network.\n\nAnnual premiums for dental insurance run, on average, according to Ireland at the NADP:\n\n$166 to $326 per person yearly for an employee only.\n\n$325 to $667 a year for an employee and family.\n\nIs Insurance Worth It?\n\nThe National Association of Dental Plans describes coverage in a typical plan:\n\nPreventive care (periodic exams, X-rays and, for some age groups, sealants) \u2014 100%.\n\n(periodic exams, X-rays and, for some age groups, sealants) \u2014 100%. Basic procedures (office visits, extractions, fillings, root canals (sometimes), and periodontal treatment) \u2014 80%.\n\n(office visits, extractions, fillings, root canals (sometimes), and periodontal treatment) \u2014 80%. Major procedures (crowns, bridges, inlays, dentures and sometimes implants and root canals) \u2014 50% or less.\n\nOrthodontics coverage usually can be purchased as a rider, says the NADP. Cosmetic care is not covered.\n\nIn deciding if insurance is worthwhile for you, consider:\n\nThe annual price of premiums.\n\nThe cost of the dental care you need.\n\nYour policy\u2019s limit on how much it pays out in benefits. Some plans let you roll over unused benefits from the previous year.\n\nPolicy coverage.\n\n\u201cWhile many dental policies focus on preventive measures by offering two annual visits, you\u2019ll really start seeing the savings with more expensive treatments, like root canals and crowns,\u201d explains Angie\u2019s List.\n\nGet Your Free Credit Score & Monitoring Plus Weekly Updates From Our 50+ Experts Get It Now\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nHelp From the Affordable Care Act\n\nThe Affordable Care Act requires insurance providers to offer dental insurance for children younger than 18.\n\n\u201cAlthough the new act does not require dental coverage for adults, most state marketplaces will also offer dental coverage for adults,\u201d says the American Dental Association. Adult dental coverage may be offered as part of a comprehensive health plan or as stand-alone dental insurance. Here\u2019s more about the ACA and dental coverage:\n\nThe ADA tells how to compare benefits and assess a dental plan.\n\nUse this Healthcare.gov plan locator to find Affordable Care Act dental plans locally and compare costs.\n\n10 Alternatives\n\nDental insurance isn\u2019t the only way to cut dental bills. In fact, 39% of Americans have no dental insurance. Here are 10 other ways to cut your costs:\n\n1. Self-Insure\n\nIt may be less expensive to pay out of pocket than buy a plan. Fees vary by dentist office and by geographic region. Here are average costs in the U.S. for several common procedures, from the American Dental Association Health Policy Institute\u2019s 2013 Survey of Dental Fees:\n\nTeeth cleaning (prophylaxis) adult \u2014 $85.\n\nWhite dental filling (one surface, anterior) \u2014 $149.\n\nSilver filling (one surface, primary or permanent) \u2014 $125.\n\nPorcelain crown fused to noble metal \u2014 $1,003.\n\nComplete series of intra-oral X-rays \u2014 $124.\n\n2. Preventive Care\n\nIn many cases, the best way to save on dentistry is to take excellent care of your teeth and gums and teach children healthy dental routines. For example, did you know that fruit juices, carbonated drinks and acidic foods can help wear away your tooth enamel?\n\nThe American Dental Association tells how to brush correctly, how to floss effectively and offers more information on dental health.\n\n3. Cut Back to One Cleaning a Year\n\nIf you don\u2019t have serious dental issues, you can probably get by with one cleaning annually, not two. \u201cSeveral studies have indicated that visiting the dentist twice a year has no notable benefits when compared with a single visit annually,\u201d writes U.S. News & World Report.\n\nJust don\u2019t skip that annual cleaning and exam; it could save you from costly and serious problems.\n\n4. Discount Dental Plans\n\nDiscount plans charge an annual fee in exchange for discounted services from network providers. Before buying in, be sure to look at a list of covered procedures.\n\nEnrollment fees often run between about $80 and $120 a year. Providers\u2019 discounts commonly are 10% to 60%, says NerdWallet.\n\nBut note: \u201cThese plans typically cost less than HMOs and PPOs, but they won\u2019t save you as much money in the long run,\u201d Angie\u2019s List says.\n\n5. Request 10% Off\n\nSome dentists will take 10% off the cost of a visit or procedure if you pay at the time of the visit. Some offer a discount for cash.\n\nIf your dentist doesn\u2019t provide a discount, ask for one. A respectful and polite request has the best chance of success. Or shop around for a dentist, gathering recommendations from friends and then phoning those offices to find out if they offer a discount.\n\nFree Credit Consultation - Call 844-346-3296 Repairing Your Credit With Lexington Law Can Help You Save Money Get Help Now\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n6. Charitable Clinics\n\nLook for low-cost or free dental clinics offered in your community by local dentist volunteers.\n\nFind opportunities in your area through America\u2019s Dentists Care Foundation. Another charitable organization with volunteer dental professionals is Dentistry From the Heart, a global nonprofit organization (727-849-2002). Or ask your state\u2019s dental association (find it online) about low-cost care.\n\n7. Dental Schools\n\nDental schools, at many colleges and universities around the U.S., often offer free or reduced-cost care. Accredited programs are listed at the American Dental Association website.\n\n8. Federally Qualified Health Centers\n\nPrivate health centers offering dental services are in cities and counties across the country. They receive some government funding and charge according to what you can afford. Use the clinic locator at the federal Health Resources and Services Administration website.\n\n9. Look into Dental Tourism\n\nCost savings can be had by traveling to other countries for dental care. \u201cDental patients who live close to an international border form the majority of dental health travelers,\u201d according to Patients Beyond Borders, which publishes a site and books with information about medical and dental tourism.\n\nJosef Woodman, CEO of Patients Beyond Borders, told Fox News that an estimated 400,000 Americans crossed international borders for dental care in 2012.\n\nDo plenty of research to ensure you are getting safe and high-quality care. Some resources:\n\nThe American Dental Association has information and cautions about dentistry outside the U.S.\n\nOSAP, the Organization for Safety and Asepsis Procedures, tells how to assess infection-control practices in a dentist office and gives a checklist for obtaining safe dental care abroad. It cautions:\n\nThe decision to visit another country for dental care should go beyond simply comparing prices or even evaluating the dentists\u2019 expertise. Countries differ in their standards for infection control and safety. The use of fresh gloves, sterile instruments and safe water are not standard practice in all countries. Without these precautions, patients could be infected with diseases such as hepatitis B.\n\nThe American Dental Society of Europe connects travelers with American- or Canadian-trained dentists and provides an online referral directory.\n\n10. Broaden Your Reach\n\nDentist fees in rural counties typically are lower than in urban areas, the ADA\u2019s 2011 survey of fees found. Comparison shop for the procedure you need by phoning offices of American Dental Association member dentists outside your metro area and asking about fees.\n\nThis post originally appeared on Money Talks News.\n\nMore from Money Talks News:\n\nImage: iStock", "article_metadata": {"shareaholic": {"site_name": "Credit.com", "language": "en-US", "url": "http://blog.credit.com/2014/10/is-dental-insurance-worth-it-97371/", "article_author_name": "Marilyn Lewis - Money Talks News", "image": "//cache-blog.credit.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/dental-insurance.jpg", "site_id": "b7019d11c34f5e8ba3eb19028e0b5f7b", "article_published_time": "2014-10-04T04:01:03+00:00", "shareable_page": "true", "article_modified_time": "2016-05-26T13:45:58+00:00", "keywords": "dental care, dental health, dental insurance, dental plan, preventive dental care, personal finance", "wp_version": "7.8.0.0"}, "description": "With health insurance, there's little question that you need it.
