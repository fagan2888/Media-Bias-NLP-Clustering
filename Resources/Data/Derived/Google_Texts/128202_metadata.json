Ted Cruz, R-Texas has earned a singular honor once reserved for movie villains, according to a Friday story on Breitbart TV. Bill Maher laid into the possible Republican presidential candidates on his HBO political rant show. He had little good to say about any of them, but he reserved a special sort of ire, on the level of what he has used for Sarah Palin, for Cruz. Putting it simply, the bad boy of pay for view cable is deathly afraid of the junior senator from Texas.\n\nMaher minced no words about how terrified he is about Cruz. \u201cMaher then turned to Ted Cruz, who he said was \u2018a real a**hole\u2019 who \u2018oozed down from Canada,\u2019 was \u2018the scariest Hispanic to come out of [Texas] since Javier Bardem in No Country for Old Men,' and is \u201cwhat you\u2019d get if Ayn Rand had half a sex-change and moved to Waco.\u201d\n\nJavier Bardem is an actor who hails from Spain and is most famous for playing a psychotic murderer in the before mentioned movie. However, his politics could not be more different that Cruz\u2019s. He recently got himself in hot water for signing an open letter stating that Israel\u2019s campaign against the Hamas terrorist state in Gaza was \u201cgenocide.\u201d Cruz, on the other hand, is a warm supporter of the state of Israel.\n\nWhat political fallout that Maher's confession might create will likely redound to the benefit of Senator Cruz. Cruz\u2019s voting base, if they are aware of Maher at all, regard him as pond scum. Now, if only Vladimir Putin would confess how the prospect of President Cruz keeps him awake at night, the senator from Texas will find his political fortunes in the ascendance.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Sen.
