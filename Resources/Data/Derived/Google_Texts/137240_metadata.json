It\u2019s yet another example of why our nation\u2019s antiquated antitrust law should be either reformed or repealed entirely.\n\nThe ink wasn\u2019t even dry on the judge\u2019s order when, as CNBC.com noted, \u201canalysts called into question the office-supply chains\u2019 ability to effectively compete in the market as stand-alone companies.\u201d\n\nSpecifically, Jefferies analyst Daniel Binder advised his investor clients that Office Depot and Staples \u201cwill continue to face secular declines and each company\u2019s business is vulnerable to competition from online and non-office-supply retailers,\u201d such as Costco and Wal-Mart.\n\nBoth companies are deeply troubled, suffering from revenue and profit declines in recent years. So we wonder: What, exactly, was gained by disallowing this merger?\n\nYet U.S. District Judge Emmet G. Sullivan, who has been on the bench since the 1990s, decided that there \u201cis a reasonable probability that the proposed merger will substantially impair competition.\u201d\n\n\u201cImpair competition?\u201d Seriously?\n\nAs Binder noted, both companies separately face very real, very stiff competition whether merged or not. Amazon Business and other Internet-based business-supply companies don\u2019t have the same enormous overhead as Office Depot and Staples. And they\u2019re growing, not shrinking. So look for both of the brick-and-mortar companies now to close hundreds of stores, as they\u2019ve already announced they will, and to lay off hundreds if not thousands of workers.\n\nIt\u2019s now questionable whether Staples and Office Depot can stay in business at all. And they do go belly-up, guess what happens then? Less competition, higher prices, less choice, fewer jobs, poorer workers, another industry crushed, all for \u2026 nothing.\n\nJust as bad, both companies plunged in trading on Wednesday, a result of the grim outlook for them. Office Depot lost nearly 40% of its market value in heavy trading, while Staples lost 18%.\n\nThis, too, will have a big impact, especially on the 401(k) and IRA retirement plans that own their stock \u2014 not to mention the companies\u2019 employees, who may have a big part of their nest eggs locked up in company shares. The huge loss of wealth will have a big impact. But maybe that\u2019s the point.\n\nThis is what antitrust in the Obama Era looks like. Antitrust for antitrust\u2019s sake, with no actual economic reasoning behind it at all, an unthinking political reflex to serve progressive ideals about regulating markets. There will be no gain to consumer from this, but lots of pain.\n\nMeanwhile, ObamaCare is doing exactly what Office Depot and Staples were accused of doing \u2014 reducing competition through anti-competitive practices, in this case encouraged and abetted by the federal government. So far, it\u2019s done a bang-up job, with fewer hospitals, higher premiums, a growing doctor shortage, and less health care choice.
