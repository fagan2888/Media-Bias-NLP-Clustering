Xinhua News Agency via AP\n\nChina completed the first soft landing on the moon\u2019s surface in 37 years Saturday, marking a significant advance in Beijing\u2019s space program and a step toward its ambitions of mounting a manned lunar mission.\n\nChina took a significant step toward eventually landing a person on the moon with Monday\u2019s successful launch of a rocket carrying its first moon rover, the \u201cJade Rabbit.\u201d\n\nChina took a significant step toward eventually landing a person on the moon with Monday\u2019s successful launch of a rocket carrying its first moon rover, the \u201cJade Rabbit.\u201d\n\nChina completed the first soft landing on the moon\u2019s surface in 37 years Saturday, becoming only the third country to pull off the feat.\n\nState television showed scientists in white and pale-blue coats applauding, shaking hands and congratulating each other after the craft, Chang\u2019e 3, landed safely at 9:12 p.m. local time. It also showed photographs of the moon\u2019s surface beamed back from the craft.\n\nThe landing marked a significant advance in China\u2019s space program and a step toward its ambitions of one day following the United States in mounting a manned lunar mission.\n\nOn Sunday, a six-wheeled rover named Yutu, or Jade Rabbit, is scheduled to emerge from the landing vehicle and begin a three-month-long mission to explore the moon\u2019s surface.\n\nThe moon lander, which weighs more than a ton, landed in the right eye of the lunar feature dubbed the Man in the Moon, in a large and relatively flat volcanic crater known as the Sinus Iridum, or Bay of Rainbows. Its rockets shut off when it was about four yards above the surface, and the craft fell the remaining distance.\n\nView Graphic China sends a rover to the moon\n\nThe landing craft, which is designed to remain in place and operate for a year, carries a telescope that will survey space from the moon\u2019s surface and an ultraviolet camera that will observe the Earth and the plasmasphere surrounding it.\n\nThe rover, which will roam around for three months, will not only analyze the topsoil in a previously unexplored region of the moon but also will collect through its radar system information about the lunar surface to a depth of 100 yards.\n\nDean Cheng, a senior research fellow at the Heritage Foundation in Washington, said the radar system, in particular, would yield useful data.\n\n\u201cChina has said that to be a global power, you do have to contribute to the global pool of scientific knowledge,\u201d he said. \u201cThe moon, for all that it is our closest celestial neighbor, is rather unexplored. . . . China is, in fact, contributing to the pool of lunar knowledge.\u201d\n\nThe rover will be powered by solar panels during the lunar day, and atomic energy storage batteries will keep it warm and prevent its electronic systems from freezing during the lunar night, which lasts the equivalent of two weeks on Earth and can see temperatures as low as 180 degrees below zero Celsius, the equivalent of 292 degrees below zero Fahrenheit.\n\n\u201cCompared to the last century\u2019s space race between the United States and the former Soviet Union, mankind\u2019s current return to the moon is more based on curiosity and exploration of the unknown universe,\u201d Sun Huixian, the project\u2019s deputy chief engineer told the official Xinhua News Agency. \u201cChina\u2019s lunar program is an important component of mankind\u2019s activities to explore the peaceful use of space.\u201d\n\nThe lander and the rover are named for a Chinese myth about a woman named Chang\u2019e who swallowed magic pills and took her pet rabbit, Yutu, to the moon, where she has lived as a goddess ever since.\n\n\u201cThough people have discovered that the moon is bleached and desolate, it doesn\u2019t change its splendid role in Chinese traditional culture,\u201d Zhang Yiwu, a professor at Beijing\u2019s Peking University, told Xinhua.\n\nChina hopes to mount another mission to the moon in 2017 that would collect rock and soil samples. It also hopes to launch a space station by about 2023 and eventually, perhaps, establish lunar bases and send missions into deep space. Its space program has the advantage of consistent funding and top-level political support, and the successful moon landing will ensure that continues, Cheng said.\n\n\u201cThis was a big step,\u201d said Joan Johnson-Freese of the U.S. Naval War College in Newport, R.I. \u201cIt makes [a manned mission] far more feasible.\u201d\n\nChina\u2019s space program has established itself as a significant player globally, Johnson-Freese said. \u201cIt wants to work with developed countries to show it is a major space nation,\u201d she said, adding that China\u2019s program has also encouraged other countries, such as India, to invest more in space exploration to show they are not falling behind in the technological race.\n\nThe program is a source of deep national pride and was widely celebrated Saturday by users of the weibo microblogging sites.\n\n\u201cAt this moment my eyes are full of tears, I\u2019m proud of my motherland, I\u2019m proud that I\u2019m Chinese,\u201d wrote Huanranbingshi2000.\n\nMissK-Xiaoqiu posted: \u201cChina is mighty! It\u2019s so thrilling.\u201d\n\nBut a minority of users appeared less impressed. \u201cSo . . . the poor are still suffering from hunger, corrupt officials are still corrupt,\u201d one wrote.\n\n\u201cA lot of countries can\u2019t land on the moon, but they can make houses affordable, tuition fees affordable, medical care affordable. I think that is a better reason to be proud,\u201d wrote another.\n\nChinese media reported this month that more than 160,000 people were temporarily evacuated from their homes after the launch of the rocket carrying the moon lander dumped debris on two farm buildings.\n\nThe last soft landing on the moon was by the unmanned Soviet Luna 24 probe, which collected soil samples in 1976.\n\nLiu Liu contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Landing marks significant advance in China's space program, and step towards manned mission.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/simon.denyer?fref=ts", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Landing marks significant advance in China's space program, and step towards manned mission.", "title": "China on the moon: First soft landing in 37 years", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/china-successfully-completes-first-soft-landing-on-moon-in-37-years/2013/12/14/fad6ffb4-64c6-11e3-af0d-4bb80d704888_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2013/12/02/Foreign/Images/TS-Hkg9246450-7812.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@simondenyer"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/china-successfully-completes-first-soft-landing-on-moon-in-37-years/2013/12/14/fad6ffb4-64c6-11e3-af0d-4bb80d704888_story.html", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "China moon landing, China moon rover, China Jade Rabbit rover, Asian space race, India Mars mission, china moon", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/simon.denyer?fref=ts"}, "eomportal-uuid": "fad6ffb4-64c6-11e3-af0d-4bb80d704888", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "China moon landing, China moon rover, China Jade Rabbit rover, Asian space race, India Mars mission, china moon"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1126\"", "article_summary": "Its space program has the advantage of consistent funding and top-level political support, and the successful moon landing will ensure that continues, Cheng said.\nThe last soft landing on the moon was by the unmanned Soviet Luna 24 probe, which collected soil samples in 1976.\nIt also showed photographs of the moon\u2019s surface beamed back from the craft.\nChina took a significant step toward eventually landing a person on the moon with Monday\u2019s successful launch of a rocket carrying its first moon rover, the \u201cJade Rabbit.\u201dChina took a significant step toward eventually landing a person on the moon with Monday\u2019s successful launch of a rocket carrying its first moon rover, the \u201cJade Rabbit.\u201dChina completed the first soft landing on the moon\u2019s surface in 37 years Saturday, becoming only the third country to pull off the feat.\nChina hopes to mount another mission to the moon in 2017 that would collect rock and soil samples."}
