A store selling police supplies was broken into and now thousands of dollars worth of their gear is gone.

A store selling police supplies was broken into and now thousands of dollars worth of their gear is gone.

It happened at a place called COPS Products near Reno and Portland, and the owner said it's only a matter of time before the burglar is caught.

There's a reason Mike Schoenberger is so passionate about his product.

“The idea of a uniform goes beyond just clothing. It is a symbol of the authority that they represent and that pride goes with that,” he told News 9.

Schoenberger said he served with pride for more than 30 years as an officer with Oklahoma City police, before opening COPS Products, a supply store for first responders.

Now, he's fallen victim to a crime he investigated countless times; burglary.

“That’s a dishonorable act committed by somebody who is unwilling to adhere to a strict code of ethics. That’s what bothers me the most,” Schoenberger explained.

The police report said it happened late Wednesday night.

Someone apparently broke through the front door, and took their hammer to the glass cases inside.

Schoenberger said they stole binoculars, flash lights and knives.

Some of the pocket knives have images of police badges on them from Oklahoma City, the Oklahoma Highway Patrol, Oklahoma County Sheriff's Office and Edmond police.

But Schoenberger said no uniforms or guns were taken. The police report said the hammer was left behind.

It was a bold a desperate move to steal from those helping service men and women keep the community safe.

“If you take it upon yourself to do it, you might oughta come in and just turn yourself in because you will be found soon,” he assured those responsible.

Shoenberger said his surveillance cameras caught a person and vehicle that night. He is in the process of turning that footage over to police.
