Since the ACA mandates employers provide insurance to all \u201cfull-time\u201d employees (those working 30 hours or more), some argued workers would likely see their hours capped at 29.\n\nA report released today, examining data from the Current Population Survey (CPS) for 2005\u201315, found limited evidence this really happened.\n\n\n\nAsako Moriya, of the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), and Professor Kosali Simon, of Indiana University School of Public and Environmental Affairs, with other authors, determined the adjusted probability of working part-time before and after the ACA\u2019s enactment did not show significant change.\n\n\u201cWe did not see increases in 2015 in the probability of working either 25\u201329 hours or fewer than 25 hours per week,\u201d the authors wrote. \u201cMoreover, the increased prevalence from 2013 to 2014 in working 25\u201329 hours, while significant, was small (0.18 percentage points) and reflected an upward trend that began before passage of the ACA.\u201d\n\nHealth Affairs ID: 7698567\n\nThe data also did not show a large reduction in 2015 (or in 2014, for that matter) in the frequency of employees working 30\u201334 hours, as one might expect if employers reduced hours for workers just above the 30-hour threshold.\n\n\n\nA FiveThirtyEight analysis of the data from last January, and a separate Urban Institute report, supported the same conclusion: the ACA hasn\u2019t led to a significant number of workers being shifted from full-time employment to part-time.\n\nBut the article also noted that evidence suggests the Act \u201chas led some employers to limit the hours of workers who were already part-time, effectively giving a pay cut to some of the most vulnerable Americans,\u201d since cuts in hours mainly hit low-wage workers.\n\n\n\nFiveThirtyEight\u2019s Ben Casselman estimated \u201cthe health law has likely led a few hundred thousand workers to see their hours cut or capped. That\u2019s small in the context of an economy with 150 million workers. But it isn\u2019t a minor issue for those workers. Most of them are among the economy\u2019s most vulnerable: low-wage, part-time workers who likely have few other options.\u201d\n\nWorker advocates maintain this risk is real and pernicious. \u201cIt\u2019s important to consider how erratic work schedules have blurred the line between full-time and part-time work, and also increased turnover,\u201d said Carrie Gleason, Director of the Fair Workweek Initiative. \u201cIn low wage retail and fast food industries, unpredictable schedules and high turnover make it easy for employers to avoid the health care mandate without cutting hours.\u201d\n\nJed Graham at Investor\u2019s Business Daily has compiled a list of employers who have cut hours for hundreds of workers since 2012.\n\n\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s certainly evidence for other groups \u2014 sub-groups \u2014 where there seem to be increases in part-time work,\u201d Professor Simon told BuzzFeed News, citing workers with only high-school level education and older employees. \u201cBut at the aggregate national level, there is no statistically significant change.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"bf": {"buzzid": 4116567, "userid": 2478649}, "google-signin-clientid": "895639880237-tcoheof19odpd88p676rjc70v0iqit0o.apps.googleusercontent.com", "description": "Researchers found little evidence employers cut back on full-time hours to avoid new healthcare costs.
