Beer, wine and holiday cookies — that’s the spread the Colorado Democratic Party put out for it holiday party tonight, prompting the question: Where’s the beef? Or chicken? Or even cheese?

Democrats are saving their money for November, said chairman Rick Palacio, so they can celebrate another victory over Colorado Republicans.

U.S. Rep. Diana DeGette was one of the first Democrats to arrive for the festivities. She and Doug Linkhart, who is in Denver Mayor Michael Hancock’s administration, reminisced about serving together in the state House.

“She was my minority leader,” Linkhart said.

That’s before Democrats captured both chambers of the Colorado Legislature, a trend Colorado Republicans are optimistic about reversing next year, as evidenced by their Christmas Party last week. They believe Christmas came early this year bearing a gift called “Obamacare.”
