You know at least some of these names, probably: Wallace, Faubus, Barnett. They were men who fed our worst impulses, men who rallied citizens against citizens, instead of leading their states forward. This is what Pat McCrory did Wednesday. In just 12 hours. It wasn\u2019t the stand in the schoolhouse door. It was a sprint past the bathroom door and straight into the South\u2019s dark, bigoted past.\u201d\n\nAnd judging by the mostly mocking national reviews of the new discrimination law \u2014 the New Yorker published an article in which McCrory is described as swearing in a class of \u201cbathroom cadets\u201d to enforce the new law \u2014 it would appear that any hopes McCrory may have harbored for a national political future after his time in the mansion expires have been pretty definitively flushed down the drain.", "article_metadata": {"fb": {"pages": 71966175060}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://pulse.ncpolicywatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/cropped-logo_shadow-square-270x270.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "article_summary": "North Carolina Governor Pat McCrory did not have a good weekend on the editorial pages of the state\u2019s major newspapers.\n\u201dThe Greensboro News & Record called it \u201ca sad day for North Carolina and its cities.\u201dThe Asheville Citizen-Times decried the law\u2019s effort to demonize LGBT people.\nThis is what Pat McCrory did Wednesday.\nRaleigh\u2019s News & Observer called it \u201can insult to all the people of North Carolina.\nThe Winston-Salem Journal blasted the administration\u2019s decision to make well water near coal ash cites \u201csafe\u201d by raising the permissible amount of coal ash chemicals in the water."}
