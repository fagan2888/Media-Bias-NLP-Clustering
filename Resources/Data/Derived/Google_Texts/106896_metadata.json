But the event itself is still a mystery, even down to the contents of the barrel that exploded, and the U.S. Department of Energy is far from understanding what happened, and thus how to prevent it. This in a facility that was designed as a flagship, an example of state-of-the-art storage for nuclear waste, in particular the leftovers from weapons manufacturing.\n\nOver and over again, industrial accidents belie the assurances that corporations and governments give the doubting public about fail-safe practices for fossil-fuel extraction, waste storage and the like, the one thing that never seems to factor in is an allowance for human error.\n\nThese omissions can have deadly consequences, as with the Lac Megantic train derailment that destroyed the center of a small town in Quebec, or devastate the environment, as with the Polley Mine tailings pond dam breach that poisoned pristine British Columbia waterways earlier this month. It\u2019s the basis for lack of trust over everything from pipelines to coal trains, and it\u2019s the one thing that corporations would rather we not see.\n\nThe Los Angeles Times\u2019s stunning report illustrates just such a set of lapses and shows their effect on the environment, and beyond.
