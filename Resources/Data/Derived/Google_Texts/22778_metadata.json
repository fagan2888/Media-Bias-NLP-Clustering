ObamaCare is now a proven failure not just a potential failure. Spending is out of control, debt is rising, Americans are having a harder and harder time finding a job and the party in power always takes the blame and I believe Republicans will benefit from that.\n\nWhat do you see in the state of Missouri that Republicans need to do to maintain their supermajority?\n\nI think candidate recruitment it always a critical piece of that there are some swing seats that are open and the HRCC has done a good job with recruitment, as they always have. We are always very careful to never underestimate our Democrat opponents and they never let us down. There is no recruitment, there is no money, there is no energy, they are essentially a two county party in a 114 county state.\n\nTell me what your company is doing now, if you could sum up Axiom in one sentence how would you put it?\n\nWe are trying to win campaigns at every level of government.\n\nHow many races do you see yourself being actively engaged in in 2014?\n\nWell, we are excited about our Texas races, at the Governor\u2019s level and the statewides, and then the state senate and congressional levels, so we\u2019re excited about that expansion. We\u2019re also focused on keeping Missouri solidly Republican and serving our clients here. Keeping the house in Republican hands and not only defending our majority but growing our majority.\n\nWe are involved in 5 of the top 10 Republican takeover seats in the country; North Carolina, Arizona, California, Florida, and Minnesota, we\u2019re excited about those campaigns. And we\u2019re excited about gaining control of the U.S. Senate, by holding our seat in Georgia and capturing seats for our candidates in Iowa and Alaska.\n\nWhat do you think about becoming a father?\n\nSomewhere between excited and panicked.\n\nBonus Question\n\nWhat is your favorite movie?\n\nRed Dawn, isn\u2019t that everyone\u2019s favorite movie?", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Missouri Times", "description": "What does 2014 look like for Republicans Nationally?
