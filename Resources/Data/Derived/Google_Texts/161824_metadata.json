I can\u2019t argue with Dave\u2019s analysis. Certainly a close reading of the statute might persuade one that Obamacare is in trouble. But I don\u2019t see it that way. One thing that\u2019s clear from John Roberts\u2019 decision in Sebelius is that the canons of statutory construction get thrown out the window when they get in the way of a politically minded judge.\n\nSo here\u2019s an alternative view of the Court\u2019s decision to hear the Burwell case. It takes only four judges to accept certiorari, and those four judges were likely the dissenters in Sebelius. It\u2019s no secret that they were hopping mad at what was apparently Roberts\u2019 last minute switch in that case. What better way to embarrass him, then, than to take cert. on Burwell and ask him to reconsider Obamacare. You see, according to the principle of statutory construction adopted by Roberts in Sebelius, a judge must be willing to perform summersaults to uphold a statue if there is any basis upon which to do so. Two lower Circuit Courts have found that such a basis does in fact exist. They interpreted Obamacare\u2019s reference to \u201cthe state\u201d to include the Federal government and not just state governments. In the context, that seems wrong, but it\u2019s not altogether crazy. But the point is that Roberts cannot reject that argument and strike down Obamacare without revealing that his decision in Sebelius was an unprincipled act of a timorous politician.\n\nBut then perhaps that means that this time the Supreme Court will strike down Obamacare\u2026", "article_metadata": {"fb": {"pages": 1742097289343962}, "generator": "WordPress 4.4", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "But then perhaps that means that this time the Supreme Court will strike down Obamacare\u2026\nMy colleague on these pages, Dave Catron, is persuaded that the Supreme Court\u2019s decision to take certiorari on the Obamacare litigation (Burwell) means that one can expect the Court to undo the 2012 Sebelius decision which upheld the law.\nSo here\u2019s an alternative view of the Court\u2019s decision to hear the Burwell case.\nCertainly a close reading of the statute might persuade one that Obamacare is in trouble.\nBut the point is that Roberts cannot reject that argument and strike down Obamacare without revealing that his decision in Sebelius was an unprincipled act of a timorous politician."}
