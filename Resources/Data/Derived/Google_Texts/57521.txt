JOHANNESBURG (AP) — South Africans honored the 67 years of former president Nelson Mandela’s service to the country with 67 minutes of charity and community action around the country on his birthday.

Established in 2009, the day is meant to encourage South Africans to emulate Mandela’s humanitarian legacy and recognize the decades he spent fighting apartheid.

All over the country, South African volunteers handed out blankets and books, distributed toys at orphanages, and cleaned up public areas, before reporting their activities on social media.

His former wife Winnie Madikizela-Mandela held a lunch for elderly, needy women at the Mandela family restaurant near the family’s home in Soweto, and handed out blankets.

At the University of Johannesburg, his widow Graca Machel gave out food parcels.

Mandela died in December 2013.
