With Empire, beggars can't even be beggars.\u201d\n\nFougner, 31, says he started ponying up $620.69 a month for Empire's Platinum Guided Access health insurance plan in July because he wanted a new primary care physician, but the company \"frustrated my every effort\" to obtain one.\n\n\"Empire promised that its website would be available to find a PCP 'anytime.' Sadly, nothing could have been further from the truth,\" the suit says.\n\nHe says he used the \u201cfind a doctor\u201d function on Empire's website to track down a doctor near him who was accepting new patients, and 30 names came up.\n\nHe called the first doctor, who turned out to be working at an HIV clinic and not accepting new patients, the Manhattan Supreme Court suit says.\n\nThe second listing had the wrong phone number for the doctor, and when he got the right number, the doctor never returned his calls.\n\nJon Fougner claims Empire failed to deliver him with a primary care physician.

Others had their phones disconnected, or said they didn't accept the insurance, says the suit - which includes a pie chart of the panoply of problems he had with all 30 listings.\n\nHe says he called Empire for help and to complain numerous times, and when he was finally able to get a human being on the phone, the person said he would send him a list of available doctors. He was eventually emailed a list of the same doctors and with the same bad contact info, the suit says.\n\nAnd when he tried to find a physician on his own, the various doctors' offices he talked to were so confused by the plan information they couldn't figure out if they accepted it.\n\nHe finally got a check up on Sept. 24 by one doctor who thought she accepted the insurance \u2014 only to get a call later that day from her receptionist saying they actually did not take it. \"The receptionist claimed that, in her years of experience, no other plan had ever caused her such confusion,\" the suit says.\n\nThe experience just left Fougner frustrated.\n\n\"You feel you're in some Dickensian nightmare, you've finally solved it, and then . . . no,\" he said.\n\nFougner said he started looking for a primary physician because he\u2019s training for the New York City Marathon and wanted to have a doctor lined up.\n\nHe said what bothered him in his various communications with Empire staffers was \"they didn't seem to really care.\"\n\nJon Fougner claims that finding a doctor through the Empire website turned into a nightmare.
