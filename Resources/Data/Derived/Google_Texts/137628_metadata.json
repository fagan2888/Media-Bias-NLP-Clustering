In fact, the inaugural Dentist Quality Report, conducted by healthcare discovery platform Opencare, shows that patients gave Santa Monica a D for \u201cdental satisfaction.\u201d\n\nThe Dentist Quality Report evaluated cities and states nationwide across multiple metrics to determine where patients are most satisfied, as well as what key factors drive satisfaction. According to the report, the metric that correlates strongest with overall satisfaction is the level of trust patients have in their dentist.\n\nTo create the report, Opencare.com analyzed over 56,000 dentists across the United States. The analysis looked at over 250,000 individual online patient reviews on subjects such as a patients level of trust in their dentist\u2019s decisions, how well the patient\u2019s dentist explained medical condition(s), and the level of staff friendliness and courteousness at a dentist\u2019s office.\n\nOpencare then evaluated cities and states against one another along multiple metrics. A detailed write up explaining the report\u2019s methodology can be obtained by contacting Eva Tang, vice president of Data Science at Opencare.\n\n\u201cAfter months of analyzing thousands of individual patient reviews, the data shows that patients give Santa Monica dentists the 10th lowest grade in California for overall satisfaction,\u201d Tang said. \u201cCreating a dental environment that is attractive to patients is more important now than ever, and Santa Monica definitely has room for improvement.\u201d\n\nThough the report, which ranked the City 28th out of the 38 cities analyzed in California, was grim in the overall ranking, it did show a few things area dentists can be proud of, including the fact that Santa Monica has the highest grade (A) in \u201cscheduling speed.\u201d The report also showed that Santa Monica came in 2nd in Southern California in staff friendliness (B-), ahead of Los Angeles (C-) and San Diego (C+). Santa Monica patients also \u201ctrust their dentist\u201d more than patients in Santa Barbara (D), Los Angeles (C-) and San Diego (C-).\n\nAccording to the report, after 15 years of stagnant growth, dental expenditure in the U.S. is projected to increase 5.8 percent every year until 2023, totaling $650.2 billion dollars spent on dentistry by private health insurers alone.\n\nDespite this, there are very few reports that look directly at the quality of dentists and what patients are saying about them.\n\n\u201cWith the increase of newly insured patients seeking dental care for the first time due to programs such as Obamacare, dentists need to better understand the needs of patients,\u201d said Francois Mathieu, lead on the report at Opencare. \u201cBefore the Dental Quality Report, there was no analysis to shed any light on the quality of dental care in the country. With this data, Opencare is hoping to empower dentists with the knowledge of what patients care about so they know where to focus their efforts when trying to create a great patient experience.\u201d\n\nThe full results of Santa Monica\u2019s Dentist Quality Report can be found at https://www.opencare.com/dentists/santa-monica-ca/. The report also includes the full sets of rankings for other cities in California.\n\njennifer@smdp.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "A recent report shows that Santa Monicans don't believe their City is full of top-notch dentists.", "og": {"site_name": "Santa Monica Daily Press", "description": "A recent report shows that Santa Monicans don't believe their City is full of top-notch dentists.
