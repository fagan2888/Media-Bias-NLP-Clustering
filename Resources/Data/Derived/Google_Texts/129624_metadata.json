Another collapsed on the porch.\n\nA third man was hit. Bullets shattered glass, and a woman suffered cuts.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of crazy people out there,\u201d said Andreas Morales, 69, who owns the house, pointing to the porch where the men fell. Morales was out back, picking up bottles, when he heard the shots, he said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s my house. I feel really sad. Here in this area there are not many problems with the people,\u201d he said.\n\nMost of the guests, including the wounded men, were in their early 20s, he said. A 19-year-old girl, who had minor injuries and asked not to be named, said residents, who were cooperating with Denver police, believe the shots were fired from a gray vehicle carrying people in their 30s who were involved in the fight.\n\n\u201cIt was a fight out by the stop sign. We are pretty sure that the people who fired the shots were the ones who started the fight. They were older people, like, in their 30s,\u201d she said.\n\nDenver police said they were talking with witnesses after responding to a call from the scene at 59 Stuart St. at about 2 a.m. Sunday. Police issued a statement saying they found three victims who appeared to be suffering from gunshots. \u201cPolice are investigating what led up to the shooting,\u201d the statement said.\n\nNo suspect information was released. The medical examiner\u2019s office will release the identity of the deceased, the police statement said.\n\nThree victims were taken by ambulance to a hospital, where one was pronounced dead, police said.\n\nA 36-year-old homeowner down the block, who asked not to be identified, said he was awake and heard the party and a shot.\n\n\u201cA car zoomed down this way. It was a drive-by. Then I heard screaming. A girl said: \u2018My cousin got shot! Call an ambulance!\u2019 \u2026 It\u2019s scary.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "One man dead, another wounded as shooters attack west Denver party", "title": "One man dead, another wounded as shooters attack west Denver party", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/07/19/one-man-dead-another-wounded-as-shooters-attack-west-denver-party/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "height": 630}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-07-19T11:20:31+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-07-19T11:20:31+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "One young man is dead and another was clinging to life Sunday night after a drive-by shooter attacked a west Denver house party.\nWe are pretty sure that the people who fired the shots were the ones who started the fight.\nThen a vehicle rolled by the house, and about four shots were fired as men and women in their 20s were talking on the front porch, witnesses said.\nMorales was out back, picking up bottles, when he heard the shots, he said.\nA 36-year-old homeowner down the block, who asked not to be identified, said he was awake and heard the party and a shot."}
