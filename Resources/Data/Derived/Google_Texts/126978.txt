AUSTIN, Texas (AP) — Not even a stopped bike and a “sprint” on foot could keep Marc Marquez off the pole at the MotoGP Grand Prix of the Americas.

With barely three minutes left in qualifying Saturday, Marquez had to ditch his Repsol Honda shortly after leaving his garage when a warning light flashed.

With time running out, he scaled a 5-foot concrete wall, scampered back about 50 yards to hop on a replacement bike before delivering a blistering final lap at the Circuit of the Americas to claim pole position for the third straight year.

“My adrenaline was 100 percent,” the two-time defending world champion said. “Most important was we got the pole. It doesn’t’ matter how.”

His fastest lap was 2 minutes, 2.135 seconds and stunned the Ducati garage. Ducati rider Andrea Dovizioso appeared to be cruising to the pole when Marquez was trotting through pit lane on foot.

Marquez dropped to seventh before he got back on the track and ripped through each sector, picking up time with each split to earn his 23rd career pole position.

Two hours later, Marquez said he still didn’t know if the warning light was an engine or gearbox problem. He stopped the bike to preserve the engine because MotoGP allows teams to use only five in a season.

But even then, he still had to run stiff-legged and stiff-armed in his protective riding gear.

“The last lap was pushing 100 percent,” he said. “I nearly crashed.”

Marquez was lucky to be so close to his garage when the problem happened. Had he been at the far turn, it would have been about a two-mile run and too far to even bother.

Movistar Yamaha’s Jorge Lorenzo and Valentino Rossi will start third and fourth Sunday. Rossi won the season opener in Qatar.
