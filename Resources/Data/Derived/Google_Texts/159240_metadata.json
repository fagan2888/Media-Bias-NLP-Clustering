Patrick Kennedy (D-R.I.) have one thing in common: bipolar disorder. Both of them have publically spoken out about their struggle with mental illness, but now they are working together to push Congress to pass mental health legislation, the Business Standard reported.\n\nAt this year\u2019s National Alliance on Mental Illness Annual Convention on Thursday, some of the biggest leaders in the mental health community were in attendance, including the alliance's executive director, Mary Giliberti, as well as Kennedy and Lovato, to advocate for an urgent mental health care bill. \u201cToday our message is very clear. It\u2019s time for Congress to act for mental health by supporting the passage of a comprehensive mental health bill this year,\u201d Lovato said in CSPAN's video of the convention.\n\nKennedy expressed his gratitude to Lovato for joining NAMI\u2019s efforts. \u201cI tell you, Demi. You\u2019re our skyscraper,\" he said, referring to her song \"Skyscraper,\" \"when it comes to standing up tall, when things are falling around us because of the stigma and discrimination against mental health, and to have someone like you willing to take a stand means something to all of us, and we're really grateful again that you're here.\u201d\n\nLovato, 22, is a younger voice in the mental health care movement. She spoke out publically about her mental illness in her MTV documentary \u201cStay Strong.\u201d She also shared a little bit of her dark past and present struggles with bipolar disorder at the convention.\n\nDemi Lovato's Personal Struggle With Mental Illness\n\n\u201cI had very low periods that were so emotionally draining, that I couldn\u2019t find the strength to crawl out of bed in the morning. I was withdrawn, disconnected, and very angry. There were stretches of time that I felt nothing but shame. I would medicate myself with drugs and alcohol in an effort to feel normal. Not better, just normal,\u201d she said at the convention.\n\nIn her documentary, Lovato talks about refusing help when it came to her mental health. She had every reason to be happy but was extremely angry and developed an eating disorder and began to cut herself to self-medicate. She says she can relate to Kennedy, who said at the convention that he, too, turned to alcohol as a way to cope with his mental illness.\n\nOne of Lovato\u2019s key messages to Congress was to provide comprehensive care for people who have mental illness. Even with her fame and fortune, her fight against mental illness has not been an easy one, and without the proper care, she said she wouldn\u2019t be where she is today. Now that she is on her way to enjoying a more beautiful and healthier life, she wants others to join her. \u201cWe need to send a simple message to our nation\u2019s leaders. Mental health matters, and needs, and must be taken seriously,\u201d she said.\n\nAfter the convention, Lovato, Kennedy, and other supporters went to Capitol Hill to share a clear message with Congress: Mental illness needs to be dealt with just like any other illness. \u201cGo up there and talk about simply treating the brain like any other organ of the body,\u201d Kennedy said.\n\nOne out of 17 Americans lives with a serious mental illness and 10 percent of children and adolescents suffer from a mental or emotional disorder, NAMI reported in a fact sheet. Lovato wants to help keep these populations from falling through the cracks, which is why getting a bill passed is so important to her. She has even written a book about living with a mental illness, Staying Strong: 365 Days a Year, to help others who are just like her who need to get comprehensive mental health care. This year, Lovato's book made the New York Times bestseller list.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "mental health, demi lovato, patrick kennedy, bill, comprehensive care, capitol hill", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "At the National Alliance on Mental Illness convention, Lovato urged Congress to pass a mental health care bill this year.", "title": "Demi Lovato Tells Congress To Pass A Bill This Year For Mental Health", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/nami-convention-demi-lovato-tells-congress-pass-bill-year-mental-health-301484", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/09/05/nami-convention-demi-lovato-tells-congress-pass-bill-year-mental-health.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "At the National Alliance on Mental Illness convention, Lovato urged Congress to pass a mental health care bill this year.", "title": "Demi Lovato Tells Congress To Pass A Bill This Year For Mental Health", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/nami-convention-demi-lovato-tells-congress-pass-bill-year-mental-health-301484", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/09/05/nami-convention-demi-lovato-tells-congress-pass-bill-year-mental-health.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/09/05/nami-convention-demi-lovato-tells-congress-pass-bill-year-mental-health.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2014-09-05T16:29:35-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-09-05T16:29:34-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "At the National Alliance on Mental Illness convention, Lovato urged Congress to pass a mental health care bill this year."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe214d\"", "article_summary": "It\u2019s time for Congress to act for mental health by supporting the passage of a comprehensive mental health bill this year,\u201d Lovato said in CSPAN's video of the convention.\nBoth of them have publically spoken out about their struggle with mental illness, but now they are working together to push Congress to pass mental health legislation, the Business Standard reported.\nShe has even written a book about living with a mental illness, Staying Strong: 365 Days a Year, to help others who are just like her who need to get comprehensive mental health care.\nAt this year\u2019s National Alliance on Mental Illness Annual Convention on Thursday, some of the biggest leaders in the mental health community were in attendance, including the alliance's executive director, Mary Giliberti, as well as Kennedy and Lovato, to advocate for an urgent mental health care bill.\nMental health matters, and needs, and must be taken seriously,\u201d she said."}
