The state collected $447.8 million in March, when it anticipated taking in $449.4 million, a shortfall of only 0.4 percent.\n\nInsurance premium tax collections were robust. For March, the collections of $21.7 million exceeded expectations by $6.7 million, or nearly 46 percent. For the fiscal year to date, the collections were $107.3 million, ahead of expectations by $11 million, or 11 percent.\n\nClark Shultz, the state Insurance Department\u2019s director of governmental affairs, said the increase is tied largely to rising health insurance premiums. He said the 2010 federal health overhaul championed by President Barack Obama has led to more people having coverage and \u2014 because of its mandates \u2014 consumers paying higher premiums overall.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s almost right on target,\u201d Revenue Secretary Nick Jordan said during an interview. \u201cWe\u2019re pleased to see March like it is.\u201d\n\nBut the shortfall in tax collections since the fiscal year began in July 2015 remains larger, at 1.9 percent. The state collected $4.13 billion through March, about $81 million less than anticipated.\n\nThe $16 billion budget approved by lawmakers for the state\u2019s next fiscal year, beginning in July, would leave less than $50 million in cash reserves at the end of June 2017.\n\nThe report on March tax collections came ahead of an April 20 meeting in which legislative researchers, university economists and officials in Gov. Sam Brownback\u2019s administration will revise the state\u2019s revenue projections. Legislators have expected the new forecast to be more pessimistic because tax collections have fallen short of expectations 11 of the past 12 months.\n\n\u201cI still have grave concerns regarding the overall shortfall for the year,\u201d House Minority Leader Tom Burroughs, a Kansas City Democrat, said in a statement. \u201cLooking at other economic indicators, we see Kansas families struggling to improve their quality of life.\u201d\n\nKansas has struggled to balance its budget since the Republican-dominated Legislature slashed personal income taxes in 2012 and 2013 at Brownback\u2019s urging in hopes of stimulating the economy.\n\nIndividual income tax collections fell about 9 percent short of expectations in March, off $14.4 million, at $145.6 million. The picture for the fiscal year to date was better: Collections of $1.55 billion, short of expectations by $56.1 million, or 3.5 percent.\n\nJordan said the shortfall in individual income tax collections were largely a result of ongoing \u201cweakness\u201d in manufacturing and oil and natural gas production.\n\nAs for the rebound in sales tax collections, Jordan said he does not yet know what the state can read into the numbers.\n\nThe state collected $181.9 million in sales taxes in March, $5.9 million, or 3.3 percent, greater than expected. But collections for the fiscal year to date, at $1.7 billion, are $20.8 million, or 1.2 percent less than anticipated.\n\nCopyright 2016 Associated Press. All rights reserved.
