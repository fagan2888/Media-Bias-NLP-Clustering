New Federal Investigation Shows Cost Of Loebsack’s Vote Against Subsidy Verification

WASHINGTON – The Washington Post is out with a new report showing federal investigators were able to sign up fake applicants for ObamaCare and its subsidies. This is a stunning indictment against Dave Loebsack and his fellow Democrats who voted against verifying these very same subsidies last year.

In a very real way, the failure of ObamaCare is made clear. Not only is Dave Loebsack supporting a failing law, but now he let the law’s subsidies go to waste. From the failed website, to the Medicare cuts, and now this new investigation, it is clear ObamaCare is riddled with waste, fraud, and abuse. He should be ashamed and apologize to Iowa voters for this reckless and irresponsible vote.

“With his vote last year, Dave Loebsack ensured Stan Dupp, Sid Down, and the rest of their fake-named friends can get ObamaCare subsidies,” said NRCC Communications Director Andrea Bozek. “Meanwhile real people in Iowa are clearly suffering because of his disgraceful vote.”

Federal Investigators Were Able To Sign Up Fake Applicants Onto ObamaCare And Receive Subsidies. “In undercover tests of the new federal health insurance marketplace, government investigators have been able to procure health plans and federal subsidies for fake applicants with fictitious documents, according to findings that will be disclosed to lawmakers Wednesday.” (Amy Goldstein, Federal Undercover Investigation Signs Up Fake Applicants For ACA Coverage, Subsidies, The Washington Post, 7/22/14)

Last Year, Dave Loebsack Voted Against A Bill Requiring Income Verification For ObamaCare Subsidies. (H.R. 2775, Roll Call Vote 458, 235-191, 9/12/13)
