Why should it come as a surprise at all? Lifetime\u2019s long been the refuge of stars whose wattage has dimmed somewhat. Far from a star turn, the Grumpy Cat Lifetime movie may be a sign that we\u2019ve passed the peak of this dejected pet\u2019s fame.\n\nChristmas movies are a huge part of the women-focused cable network Lifetime\u2019s output, and they\u2019ve been a comfortable landing place for stars of yesteryear \u2014 combing through recent holiday offerings, one finds onetime TV Superman Dean Cain (in \u201cA Christmas Wedding\u201d), \u201cNoxzema Girl\u201d Rebecca Gayheart (in \u201cThe Christmas Blessing\u201d), and Hollywood cautionary tale Sean Young (in \u201cHome for the Holidays\u201d). Outside of the Christmas space, Tori Spelling \u2014 who went on to get a Lifetime reality show about her disastrous marriage \u2014 made a post-\u201c90210\u2033 career of appearing in Lifetime movies including the infamous \u201cMother, May I Sleep With Danger?\u201d\n\nThe network plays a volume game: Even now, in an era when prestige-y cable networks are producing fewer and fewer original movies, Lifetime churns out enough content that it has a separate network just for its movies. Though the offerings differ wildly in substance, a sort of famous person is the hook \u2014 recognizable on sight and bringing a bit of baggage to save on exposition, but not actually famous enough to be able to say no to the gig. As Lifetime\u2019s, lately, been producing tonier entertainments, this hasn\u2019t abated. Heather Graham in \u201cFlowers in the Attic,\u201d Rob Lowe in \u201cDrew Peterson: Untouchable,\u201d and Lindsay Lohan in \u201cLiz & Dick\u201d may have had marginally more to lose than Rebecca Gayheart or Tori Spelling, but they all bring a set of associations that act as a multiplier for audience interest. That they all are not exactly potential EGOTs acting-wise is beyond the point, or maybe precisely the point \u2014 no star of a Lifetime movie is liable to shut the set down while finding his or her motivation.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Tori Spelling and Lindsay Lohan made the leap first.
