It is assisted by the European Union.\n\nJames Phillips, an expert on the Middle East at The Heritage Foundation, said that \u201cthe report raises questions about whether the Obama administration and European allies have looked the other way on some sanctions violations.\u201d\n\n\u201cUnited Nations monitors issued a report that expressed frustration about the failure of United Nations member states to report back to the United Nations about new incidents of Iran violating Security Council sanctions against its nuclear program, even though some have unfolded in plain sight,\u201d Phillips said. \u201cAs an example, the United Nations report cited the failure of member states to report the highly publicized presence of Iranian General Qassem Suleimani\u2014the leader of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps elite Quds Force\u2014in Iraq. His Iraq visit was a violation of the United Nations-imposed travel ban on key Iranian officials.\u201d\n\nPhillips added:\n\n\u201cThe United Nations report underscores the danger that the Obama administration and other governments may purposely ignore Iranian cheating on the impending nuclear agreement, just as they already apparently are ignoring Iranian violations of United Nations sanctions resolutions.\u201d\n\nThe Security Council imposed the sanctions against Iran to inhibit Tehran\u2019s ability to develop nuclear weapons, despite claims by Tehran that its enrichment program is merely intended for peaceful purposes.\n\nThe report comes just weeks before the June 30 deadline for a nuclear deal with Iran.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Countries monitoring the Iranian nuclear program are failing to report Iran for violating sanctions imposed against it, according to a UN report.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Countries monitoring the Iranian nuclear program are failing to report Iran for violating sanctions imposed against it, according to a UN report.", "title": "United Nations Report: Iranian Violations of Sanctions Are Going Unreported", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150610_UNReport_Scanlon.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-06-10T20:33:06+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1QN8SAv"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Countries monitoring the Iranian nuclear program are failing to report Iran for violating sanctions imposed against it, according to a UN report.", "title": "United Nations Report: Iranian Violations of Sanctions Are Going Unreported", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150610_UNReport_Scanlon.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Security", "tag": "diplomacy", "published_time": "2015-06-10T20:10:06+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-06-10T20:33:06+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Iran, Iranian nuclear deal, P5+1, Iranian nuclear weapons"}, "article_summary": "Countries monitoring the Iranian nuclear program are failing to report Iran for violating sanctions imposed against it, according to a United Nations report.\nThe report also suggests that violations of the United Nations Security Council\u2019s sanctions by the Iranian regime are going unreported because it would reflect poorly on Tehran as they negotiate a nuclear deal with the U.S. and other world powers.\n\u201cAs an example, the United Nations report cited the failure of member states to report the highly publicized presence of Iranian General Qassem Suleimani\u2014the leader of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps elite Quds Force\u2014in Iraq.\nThe report comes just weeks before the June 30 deadline for a nuclear deal with Iran.\nIt is assisted by the European Union."}
