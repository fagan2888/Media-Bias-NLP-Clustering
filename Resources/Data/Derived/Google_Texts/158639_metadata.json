At the end of \u201cCatching Fire\u201d you learn the victors of the previous \u201cHunger Games\u201d are conspiring to secretly take down the Capitol and its president, and Katniss will be their leader, their Luke Skywalker if you will (or at the least, their symbol).\n\nPhilip Seymour Hoffman\u2019s character Plutarch Heavensbee is being compared to Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams).\n\nWhose side is Heavensbee on anyway? Much like Calrissian, Heavensbee originally works with \u201cthe empire\u201d (in this case the Capitol), using them for their tools, before ditching them for the rebellion.\n\nThey even have their own ship! (It\u2019s no Millennium Falcon, but it will do.)\n\nThe endings of both films are similar.\n\nThe ending of \"Empire Strikes Back\" had Han Solo kidnapped by the Empire and Luke Skywalker saved by a rebel ship. The ending of \"Catching Fire\" had Peeta captured by the Capitol and Katniss Everdeen saved by a rebel ship flying to the outskirts of Panem to figure out how to save Peeta.\n\nMany reviews were already comparing the Capitol militants to \u201cStar Wars\u201d Stormtroopers.\n\n\u201cCatching Fire\u201d:\n\n\u201cStar Wars\u201d:\n\nObviously coincidental, but people can\u2019t help but compare this image of Finnick carrying a mute Mags from \"Catching Fire\" to Luke running around with Yoda on his back.\n\n\n\n\n\nMTV compiled even more possible parallels between the two (most a bit too far-reaching).\n\nDid you think of \u201cStar Wars\u201d while seeing \u201cThe Hunger Games\u201d sequel?", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#185f7c", "sailthru.author": "Kirsten Acuna", "application-name": "Business Insider", "twitter": {"description": "Now that \"The Hunger Games: Catching Fire\" is out in theaters, some are already comparing its similarities to arguably the best \"Star Wars\" film.", "creator": "KirstenAcuna", "url": "http://www.businessinsider.com/hunger-games-catching-fire-star-wars-the-empire-strikes-back-2013-11", "image": "http://static2.businessinsider.com/image/529226d869bedd2c3c219fb2-506-253/people-are-comparing-the-hunger-games-catching-fire-to-star-wars-the-empire-strikes-back.jpg", "title": "People Are Comparing \u2018The Hunger Games: Catching Fire\u2019 To \u2018Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back\u2019", "site": "BI_Entertain", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.verticals": "thewire", "linkedin": {"owner": "mid:1d5f7b"}, "sailthru.tags": "Movies, The Hunger Games: Catching Fire, The Hunger Games, Star Wars, Film Industry, Kirsten Acuna", "description": "Now that \"The Hunger Games: Catching Fire\" is out in theaters, some are already comparing its similarities to arguably the best \"Star Wars\" film.", "author": "Kirsten Acuna", "sailthru.date": "2013-11-24", "sailthru.title": "People Are Comparing \u2018The Hunger Games: Catching Fire\u2019 To \u2018Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back\u2019", "theme-color": "#185f7c", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://static2.businessinsider.com/image/529226f2eab8eae65a3a191c-50-50/people-are-comparing-the-hunger-games-catching-fire-to-star-wars-the-empire-strikes-back.jpg", "news_keywords": "Movies, The Hunger Games: Catching Fire, The Hunger Games, Star Wars, Film Industry, Kirsten Acuna", "tbi-image": "http://static1.businessinsider.com/image/529226f2eab8eae65a3a191c/people-are-comparing-the-hunger-games-catching-fire-to-star-wars-the-empire-strikes-back.jpg", "fb": {"app_id": 155043519637}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://static1.businessinsider.com/assets/images/us/favicons/mstile-144x144.png?v=BI-US-2016-03-31", "date": "2013-11-24", "article": {"publisher": "businessinsider", "author": "http://www.businessinsider.com/author/kirsten-acuna"}, "sailthru.description": "Now that \"The Hunger Games: Catching Fire\" is out in theaters, some are already comparing its similarities to arguably the best \"Star Wars\" film.", "viewport": "width=1024", "og": {"site_name": "Business Insider", "description": "Now that \"The Hunger Games: Catching Fire\" is out in theaters, some are already comparing its similarities to arguably the best \"Star Wars\" film.", "title": "People Are Comparing \u2018The Hunger Games: Catching Fire\u2019 To \u2018Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back\u2019", "url": "http://www.businessinsider.com/hunger-games-catching-fire-star-wars-the-empire-strikes-back-2013-11", "image": "http://static1.businessinsider.com/image/529226d869bedd2c3c219fb2-1190-625/people-are-comparing-the-hunger-games-catching-fire-to-star-wars-the-empire-strikes-back.jpg", "type": "article"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Business Insider", "title": "People Are Comparing \u2018The Hunger Games: Catching Fire\u2019 To \u2018Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back\u2019", "sailthru.image.full": "http://static1.businessinsider.com/image/529226f2eab8eae65a3a191c/people-are-comparing-the-hunger-games-catching-fire-to-star-wars-the-empire-strikes-back.jpg", "tbi-vertical": "thewire"}, "article_summary": "\u201cThe Hunger Games: Catching Fire\u201d came out this weekend and some are comparing the second film in a four-part series of adaptations to arguably the best \u201cStar Wars\u201d film, \u201cThe Empire Strikes Back.\u201dWhat?\nDid you think of \u201cStar Wars\u201d while seeing \u201cThe Hunger Games\u201d sequel?\nBut \u201cStar Wars\u201d?\nWhen the first film came out, people obviously compared \u201cThe Hunger Games\u201d to \u201cBattle Royale.\u201d Both works pitted children fighting against each other to the death.\nOnce you get past the kid-killing in the original \u201cHunger Games,\u201d you realize this isn\u2019t a story about killing children, but one about rebellion."}
