Clinton will be back in California on Sunday to collect yet more checks. And one of the toughest challenges she and her advisors face is convincing this crowd of Hollywood executives and other titans of West Coast industry that they\u2019ve got the campaign under control.\n\nLately, it\u2019s been tough. Rival Bernie Sanders \u2013 a self-described socialist \u2013 is ahead in New Hampshire. The threat of the charming and formidable Vice President Joe Biden crashing the nominating contest looms. The FBI is investigating Clinton\u2019s email server. It has all amounted to a lot of nail-biting and hand-wringing in the cocktail lounges of Beverly Hills and beach houses of Malibu.\n\n\u201cIt is something everyone is talking about,\u201d said one prolific Clinton fundraiser, who asked to remain unidentified for fear of antagonizing the campaign. \u201cIs she going to lose? What is going on? Is Biden running? Is she in trouble? Why is the campaign doing this or that?\u201d\n\nThe worrying calmed down some after the \u201cTonight Show\u201d appearance, where Clinton showed her easygoing, relatable and ultimately reassuring side that voters so rarely get to see. It aired Sept. 16, the same night as the GOP debate in Simi Valley, the content of which panicked some previously unmotivated Clinton donors in California enough to pull out their checkbooks.\n\nTRAIL GUIDE: All the latest news on the 2016 presidential campaign >>\n\nBut by the time Clinton was preparing this week to roll back into California for her next fundraising swing, jitters set in anew. The problem now: Not enough glitterati are hosting her during this three-day blitz through Los Angeles and the Bay Area. There is an event hosted by Lionsgate Motion Picture Group Co-Chairman Rob Friedman, but beyond that, one campaign check bundler said, \u201cit is the absolute B team.\u201d\n\nThe reasons why are in dispute. One Hollywood-based advisor to top donors, whose A-list clients turned down requests to host Clinton next week, said it wasn\u2019t a matter of waning support. The clients were feeling that the star-studded events should be more spaced out, and Clinton has already had a few, this person said, adding that reading the tea leaves of Hollywood donors is never a great idea.\n\n\u201cYou should never use Hollywood as a litmus test for how a candidate is performing,\u201d the advisor said. \u201cWe are fickle, and we are used to building up and discarding our stars.\u201d\n\nThere has been no shortage of that. Early exhilaration over the possibility that Democrats could avoid a damaging nomination fight fades further into doubt each time Clinton stumbles. Days before Clinton was to show up in California, campaign manager Robby Mook was dispatched to the homes of loyalist donors in the Bay Area for some reassurance. The major givers whom others look to for a signal insist that everything is fine.\n\nAndy Spahn, whose political consulting firm advises both Jeffrey Katzenberg and Steven Spielberg, said that if donors are frustrated, it is not with the campaign but with the media for its attention to Clinton\u2019s use of private email while secretary of State. He said Clinton\u2019s much-anticipated testimony next month on the matter before a congressional committee, along with the first Democratic debate a week earlier, will allow her to \u201cfurther showcase her strength as a candidate.\u201d\n\nGet more national political news and the latest from Campaign 2016 >>\n\nThat\u2019s not to say the big donors he represents wouldn\u2019t run the campaign differently. They want Clinton to shift her focus to the main super PAC supporting her, Priorities USA, which can raise unlimited amounts, so long as it doesn\u2019t coordinate with the official campaign. Clinton has avoided private meetings with potential donors to the organization, opting instead to attend fundraisers for the official campaign, which can only legally raise $2,700 from each donor.\n\n\u201cWe are certainly weighing in and looking to get more time from the campaign for Priorities,\u201d Spahn said. \u201cShe is being attacked by 16 Republican campaigns and super PACs run by the Koch brothers, Karl Rove, et cetera. She needs resources to respond and put out a positive message. The super PAC is critically important at this stage of the campaign.\u201d\n\nPriorities had a lackluster first quarter, raising just $15 million, a big chunk of it coming from Californians such as Katzenberg, Spielberg, San Francisco philanthropist Herbert Sandler, entertainment tycoon Haim Saban and his wife, Cheryl, all of whom gave $1 million each. Right to Rise, the super PAC backing Republican heavyweight Jeb Bush, eclipsed Priorities that quarter, raising $103 million.\n\nIn the current reporting period, John Podesta, the Clinton campaign chairman, and Paul Begala, the star Democratic operative, among other notable surrogates, began aggressively soliciting donations for Priorities. But even with $25 million in new commitments, it is still far behind the pace Right to Rise set last quarter.\n\nThen there is the Biden factor \u2013 another issue on which Clinton\u2019s California loyalists can\u2019t seem to agree. Some fret that big donors will defect if the vice president mounts a credible run. Others predict it would only help Clinton.\n\nSeveral Californians who\u2019ve raised money for President Obama signed a letter this month pledging support for Biden should he enter the race. \u201cIf he jumps in, we will be there for him 100%,\u201d said Samantha Millman, a Los Angeles real estate investor who was among them.", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Hillary Clinton's big donors in California have found all sorts of reasons to be nervous", "Description": "During a month in which some of Hillary Rodham Clinton\u2019s biggest donors fretted, obsessed over and second-guessed her campaign, it wasn\u2019t Clinton\u2019s big policy speeches on healthcare or her vow to block the Keystone XL pipeline that helped ease nerves.
