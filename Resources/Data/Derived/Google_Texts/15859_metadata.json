Obama\u2019s health care law created the exchange system.\n\nUnder an amendment to the law crafted by Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, the government can only offer members of Congress and their staff health care insurance that\u2019s sold through an exchange.\n\n\u201cWe will presumably go on the exchange and sign up for health care, and we\u2019re in the process of transitioning over to do that,\u201d Cruz said in an interview with The Des Moines Register.\n\nCruz could go without insurance, or his family could get its coverage directly from an insurance company at what would likely be a far higher rate than is available via an exchange. Doing so would mean Cruz would not get the contribution from his employer to help offset the full cost of his coverage.\n\nAsked about his plans for health care insurance on Tuesday, Cruz\u2019s staff initial pointed reporters to his interview with the Register. Several hours later, Rick Tyler, a Cruz spokesman, said Cruz and his family had not yet settled on an option or the financial implications of such a choice.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s let them make a decision on what coverage they\u2019ll get before we start speculating on every variable,\u201d Tyler said.\n\nCruz has been a vocal critic of the health care law and, in 2013, set in motion a partial government shutdown as part of a 21-hour filibuster that partially shuttered the government in an attempt to sever funding for the law.\n\nIn his campaign kick-off speech Monday, Cruz pledged to dismantle the law. His advisers said that remains his plan and pointed to his comments to the newspaper from Iowa, which hosts the lead-off caucuses in early 2016.\n\n\u201cI believe in 2017, a new president, a Republican president, will sign legislation repealing every word of it,\u201d Cruz told the Register.\n\nDemocrats highlighted that Cruz is now enrolling in a program he frequently criticizes.\n\n\u201cThe Affordable Care Act, by design, helps Americans who have gaps in employment get coverage, and it\u2019s working,\u201d Democratic National Committee spokeswoman Holly Shulman said. \u201cWe encourage others to follow presidential candidate Ted Cruz to http://www.healthcare.gov and get covered.\u201d\n\nPresident Barack Obama, meanwhile, was marking the law\u2019s fifth anniversary in remarks Wednesday at the White House.\n\n___\n\nFollow Philip Elliott on Twitter at: http://twitter.com/philip_elliott", "article_metadata": {"description": "GOP presidential candidate Ted Cruz could soon be buying his family's health care coverage through the Affordable Care Act he has vowed to d\u2026", "generator": "WordPress.com", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.linmedia.newstouch.krqe", "og": {"site_name": "KRQE News 13", "description": "GOP presidential candidate Ted Cruz could soon be buying his family\u2019s health care coverage through the Affordable Care Act he has vowed to dismantle.", "title": "Cruz eyes insurance via Obamacare, a law he vows to scrap", "url": "http://krqe.com/2015/03/25/cruz-eyes-insurance-via-obamacare-a-law-he-vows-to-scrap/", "image": {"width": 660, "identifier": "https://lintvkrqe.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/gop-2016-cruz_newb.jpg?w=1200", "height": 371}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "GOP presidential candidate Ted Cruz could soon be buying his family\u2019s health care coverage through the Affordable Care Act he has vowed to dismantle.", "title": "Cruz eyes insurance via Obamacare, a law he vows to scrap", "image": {"src": "https://lintvkrqe.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/gop-2016-cruz_newb.jpg?w=640"}, "creator": "@krqe", "site": "krqe", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "keywords": "Home, National, World, News, Politics", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-tooltip": "Albuquerque News and Weather, Santa Fe, Rio Rancho, New Mexico | krqe.com", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=488525050", "fb": {"pages": 98691658081}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://krqe.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/8ec5fa807657323809caf8c9db73e4ed?s=16", "application-name": "KRQE News 13", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/krqenews", "published_time": "2015-03-25T13:21:08+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-03-25T14:53:25+00:00"}, "msvalidate.01": "D680B65910F40B115B0DE7298B906E56", "google-site-verification": "DybmyJ3qnLleDwi_e3uE6Wh_x8CKcwUamZdUxoElU1M", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Asked about his plans for health care insurance on Tuesday, Cruz\u2019s staff initial pointed reporters to his interview with the Register.\nThat meant the family would soon lose access to health insurance through Mrs. Cruz\u2019s job, triggering a need for the Cruz family to find a new policy.\nObama\u2019s health care law created the exchange system.\nSen.
