Not since FDR\u2014who seized coal mines and department stores, dictated wages and prices, and even weighed whether he should decree when Americans could eat meat.\n\nBut at least FDR had a reason: He was fighting a world war. What's Trump's excuse?\n\nThe other day Trump said he approved of Obamacare's individual mandate\u2014perhaps the biggest expansion of government authority over individual choice since the suspension of the draft.\n\nTrump also is a big fan of eminent domain\u2014the process by which the government confiscates someone's property because it thinks it has a better use for it. He once tried to use eminent domain to seize the home of an elderly widow so he could build a limousine parking lot. Nice.\n\nDer Donald also wants to build a wall on the southern border\u2014\"a great, great wall\"\u2014and he will make Mexico pay for it. How will he do that, exactly? As with everything else Trump proposes, details are fuzzy.\n\nBut Mexicans aren't the only thing Trump wants to keep out of the country. He promises to enact \u201ca total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States.\" That would rival FDR's internment of Japanese-Americans not only in scale but also in the degree to which it lacks any legal, constitutional, or even rational justification.\n\nTrump also has proposed slapping a 45 percent tariff on Chinese exports to America. Put another way, he wants to raise consumer prices here 45 percent. This would be terrible for shoppers at Walmart, whose shelves are stocked with many made-in-China products. But it also would be terrible for people who shop elsewhere, because Walmart's low prices exert downward pressure on prices at other retailers. If prices on Chinese goods go up by almost half, prices on American-made goods will go up, too.\n\nYet even if that were not the case, Trump's proposal amounts to telling Americans who want to buy products manufactured or assembled in China\u2014which includes everything from cheap plastic toys to iPhones\u2014that they should not be allowed to. Who the heck does Trump think he is, to decide what other people may and may not buy? (Answer, of course: He's Trump!)\n\nTrump also endorses not only waterboarding, but other \"much worse\" forms of torture, and says that if elected he would use them. \"Don't tell me it doesn't work\u2014torture works,\" he said in South Carolina. How does he know that? Because he says so: \"Half these guys (say) 'torture doesn't work.' Believe me, it works.\"\n\n\"Believe me.\" That is Trump's answer to any skepticism about his notions: It's true because he says so.\n\n- \"I will build a great wall - and nobody builds walls better than me, believe me.\"\n\n- \"I would have Mexico pay for it. Believe me, they will pay for it.\"\n\n- Jews will \"like me very much, believe me.\"\n\n- \u201cIf I\u2019m president, you\u2019re going to see 'Merry Christmas' in department stores, believe me.\"\n\n- \"Ted Cruz gave us Obamacare, believe me.\"\n\nHe doesn't always say \"believe me,\" but he often invokes its equivalent. For instance, his proposal to deport 11 million unlawfully present foreigners is contingent on being able to find them. Regarding that, he told CNN: \"Politicians aren't going to find them because they have no clue. We will find them, we will get them out. It's feasible if you know how to manage.\"\n\nWhich Trump does. Just ask him yourself.\n\nThis is more than a verbal tic. It's an argumentum ad verecundiam, an appeal to authority: Something is true because so-and-so says it is true. Most of the time people who employ this logical fallacy appeal to an external authority: a constitutional scholar, Wikipedia, the Bible. Trump's authority is himself.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "Trump asks voters to \"believe me.\" But why should they?", "title": "Donald Trump\u2019s Authoritarian Fantasies", "url": "http://reason.com/archives/2016/02/29/donald-trumps-authoritarian-fantasies", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/1456764490156.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@reason", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/1456764490156.jpg", "description": "Trump asks voters to \"believe me.\" But why should they?", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Donald Trump\u2019s Authoritarian Fantasies"}, "fb": {"pages": 17548474116}, "article": {"tag": "Must Reads", "published_time": "2016-02-29T17:01:00+00:00", "author": "http://reason.com/people/a-barton-hinkle"}, "msvalidate.01": "212A68A07785B3080038A845C4EE8905", "google-site-verification": "-AmMiilAN-pnjWt369CUWae-VQ-b9wmH4fSGyhbkQxw", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2"}, "article_summary": "Der Donald also wants to build a wall on the southern border\u2014\"a great, great wall\"\u2014and he will make Mexico pay for it.\nTrump's authority is himself.\nBut Mexicans aren't the only thing Trump wants to keep out of the country.\nHas America ever seen a more authoritarian presidential candidate than Donald Trump?\nThat is Trump's answer to any skepticism about his notions: It's true because he says so."}
