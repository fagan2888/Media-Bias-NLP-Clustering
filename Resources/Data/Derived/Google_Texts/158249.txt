In the days since Obamacare reached its goal of enrolling at least 7 million people before the end of March, Republicans and conservatives have been struggling to figure out the best way to downplay the good news and reaffirm their deeply held belief that the health insurance reform is a disaster. While most have decided to pursue what one could call the “phony numbers” tactic and argue the White House was “cooking the books,” Glenn Beck revealed on his radio show on Wednesday that he would be approaching the issue from a slightly different angle.

Instead of critiquing the administration’s arithmetic, Beck opted to yell incoherently about how President Obama is a sociopathic dictator who is trying to keep Glenn Beck from pursuing happiness.

Speaking of Obama’s Tuesday press event at the White House, during which the president celebrated Obamacare’s early successes and urged Republicans to give up on repealing the law, Beck said, “We’ve never had this before.”

“This guy, this guy,” Beck continued, “you put him in a military uniform — I’m not kidding you — you put him on a balcony in a military uniform, this guy is a full-fledged dictator.”

Beck went on to complain that the press event was orchestrated by the White House and attended by supporters of the president, a situation that Beck argued reduced the event to “a circus.” He railed against the press for covering the event and the Obamacare 7 million figure with, he claimed, mendacious intent. “And everyone in the press — you rat bastards — every single one of you know what he’s saying isn’t true.”
