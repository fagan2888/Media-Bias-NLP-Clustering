High-deductible plans, however, are primarily characterized by lower premiums, higher deductibles and minimal coinsurance/copays until the deductible is met. If qualified, they can be linked to a health savings account.\n\nSo, what is it that gives these plans the ability to reduce costs? How are high-deductible plans different from conventional plans and who would benefit the most from a high-deductible plan?\n\nThe nominal reimbursements offered by high-deductible plans until that high deductible is met make plan enrollees more likely to consider the cost of treatment prior to receiving a procedure or taking a medication. The seemingly simple action of considering the cost of health care by the consumer could have a noticeable impact on health care spending.\n\nBy design, the costs associated with high-deductible plans are front-loaded, with the patient paying 100 percent of most doctor visits, procedures, and prescription medications, all of which count towards the annual deductible. Once the deductible is met, the insurance company will cover a large portion of any further expenses (often 80 percent to 100 percent).\n\nHealthy individuals (i.e. those who do not plan on meeting the annual deductible) typically choose high-deductible plans due to the cost-saving aspect of the reduced premium.\n\nBecause these individuals are required to pay for the full cost of any health care, they are likely to attempt to minimize their spending by shopping for the best provider or by forgoing unnecessary and potentially wasteful treatment. These two actions have the effect of creating competition among providers and reducing unnecessary spending. In addition, the act of consumers shopping for providers could assist in the ongoing effort to promote price transparency as it relates to health care costs.\n\nIncreased competition will ideally result in lower prices for consumers, which is much needed in the heavily monopolized health care sector. With more responsibility given to the consumer, high-deductible plans are often referred to as a type of consumer-driven health plan.\n\nOn top of the above market forces -- which could reduce overall health care costs -- are the cost-saving benefits for the individual from the use of a health savings account. HSAs are best described as 401(k)s which can be used to pay for qualified health expenses. With 100 percent tax-deductible contributions ($3,300 for individuals and $6,550 for families, annually), tax-deferred interest earnings, the lack of a use-it-or-lose-it clause (different from flexible spending accounts), and the option to invest contributions (e.g. savings for retirement or future medical expenses), HSAs can be a valuable financial tool for many households.\n\nWith health care costs on the rise, many Americans are looking for ways to reduce the cost of health care. By taking some of the spending responsibility into their own hands via HSA-qualified high-deductible health plans and other types of consumer-driven health plans, many consumers can have the effect of reducing both the individual and overall cost of health care.\n\nPeter Dorski, a microbiologist for a Solon firm, originally wrote this as part of an online course toward his Master's of Science in Health Sciences degree at the George Washington University School of Medicine and Health Sciences.", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "George Washington University Medical School, HDHPs, Health Sciences, Peter Dorski, United States, United States Congress, per capita, Air Care Alliance, affordable-care-act, affordable-care-act-premium-increases, health-care-premium-increases, health-care-premiums, health-savings-accounts, high-deductible-health-plans, obamacare, peter-dorski, opinion", "title": "High-deductible health insurance plans can save money: Peter Dorski (Opinion)", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"High-deductible health insurance plans can save money: Peter Dorski (Opinion)\", \"link\": \"http://www.cleveland.com/opinion/index.ssf/2015/09/high-deductible_health_insuran.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://imgick.cleveland.com/home/cleve-media/width620/img/opinion_impact/photo/18846672-standard.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"16711345\", \"pub_date\": \"2015-09-27T12:42:21Z\", \"author\": \"Guest Columnist/cleveland.com\", \"tags\": [\"@solon\",\"affordable-care-act\",\"affordable-care-act-premium-increases\",\"health-care-premium-increases\",\"health-care-premiums\",\"health-savings-accounts\",\"high-deductible-health-plans\",\"obamacare\",\"peter-dorski\"] }", "twitter": {"description": "High-deductible health plans' nominal reimbursements until high deductibles are met make plan enrollees more likely to consider the cost of treatment prior to receiving a procedure or taking a medication, writes Peter Dorski.", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@clevelanddotcom"}, "article_date_updated": "Sunday, September 27, 2015,  8:42 AM", "parsely-metadata": "{\"short_title\": \"High-deductible health insurance plans can save money: Peter Dorski\", \"image_url\": \"http://media.cleveland.com/opinion_impact/photo/highdeductibleplansjpg-274522f0edb1c92a.jpg\", \"author_name\": \"neomgguest\", \"author_nickname\": \"Guest Columnist/cleveland.com\", \"author_id\": \"10949015\", \"source_blog_name\": \"Opinion, Editorials, Letters and Columns\", \"source_blog_url\": \"http://www.cleveland.com/opinion/index.ssf/\", \"sponsored_content\": \"0\" }", "og": {"site_name": "cleveland.com", "description": "High-deductible health plans' nominal reimbursements until high deductibles are met make plan enrollees more likely to consider the cost of treatment prior to receiving a procedure or taking a medication, writes Peter Dorski.", "title": "High-deductible health insurance plans can save money: Peter Dorski (Opinion)", "url": "http://www.cleveland.com/opinion/index.ssf/2015/09/high-deductible_health_insuran.html", "image": "http://imgick.cleveland.com/home/cleve-media/width620/img/opinion_impact/photo/18846672-standard.jpg", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "cleveland.com", "article": {"author": "http://"}, "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Sunday, September 27, 2015,  8:42 AM", "article_author": "Guest Columnist/cleveland.com", "Description": "High-deductible health plans' nominal reimbursements until high deductibles are met make plan enrollees more likely to consider the cost of treatment prior to receiving a procedure or taking a medication, writes Peter Dorski."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2732\"", "article_summary": "To limit some of these increasingly burdensome costs, many individuals are switching their insurance from conventional health plans to high-deductible health plans.\nWith health care costs on the rise, many Americans are looking for ways to reduce the cost of health care.\nHow are high-deductible plans different from conventional plans and who would benefit the most from a high-deductible plan?\nThe seemingly simple action of considering the cost of health care by the consumer could have a noticeable impact on health care spending.\nWith more responsibility given to the consumer, high-deductible plans are often referred to as a type of consumer-driven health plan."}
