Rutgers and Condi Rice. Brandeis and Ayaan Hirsi Ali. Smith College and Christine LaGarde. Glenn Beck, Jeb Bush, and Chris Christie.\n\nAmid all the swirling controversies over campus commencement speakers, seemingly in a separate corner of the political universe another controversy swirls over Common Core. In fact? They are the same controversy. Not to mention the battle for the 2016 GOP presidential nomination. You could, in fact, call Common Core Obamacare for Education.\n\nLet\u2019s start with an appearance on the O\u2019Reilly show the other night by Glenn Beck. Holding up an exercise on \u201cPossessive Nouns\u201d Beck read the problems a third grade grammar school student had to solve as a homework assignment. The exercise involved making \u201ceach sentence less wordy by replacing words with a possessive noun phrase.\u201d\n\nPossessive nouns. Simple and uncontroversial enough, yes? Here are the six sentences, the \u201cwordy\u201d sentence first and the grammatically correct version second, exactly as sequentially presented by Common Core.\n\n1. The job of a president is not easy.\n\nA president\u2019s job is not easy. 2. The people of a nation do not always agree.\n\nA nation\u2019s people do not always agree. 3. The choices of the president affect everyone.\n\nThe president\u2019s choices affect everyone. 4. He makes sure the laws of the country are fair.\n\nHe makes sure the country\u2019s laws are fair. 5. The commands of government officials must be obeyed by all.\n\nGovernment officials\u2019 commands must be obeyed by all. 6. The wants of an individual are less important than the well-being of the nation.\n\nAn individual\u2019s wants are less important than the nation\u2019s well-being.\n\nSo in the course of a simple exercise in grammar, third grade kids are being told, to quote again, that \u201cGovernment official\u2019s commands must be obeyed by all\u201d and that \u201cAn individual\u2019s wants are less important than the nation\u2019s well-being.\u201d As Beck then noted, Common Core \u201cis about taking our kids and molding them into good little citizens, however the state wants those good little citizens.\u201d\n\nAnother example of how this works is found in this Common Core story over at the Daily Caller. The headline:\n\nCommon Core MATH lesson plans attack Reagan, list Lincoln\u2019s religion as \u2018liberal\u2019\n\nThe DC story says in part:\n\nMath teachers using this lesson are supposed to begin by engaging their math students \u201cin a discussion about the Presidents of the United States\u201d including party affiliation. The lesson plan then offers three websites for obtaining information about American presidents. The \u201crecommended\u201d site is a page entitled \u201cPresidents\u201d at the website Infoplease.com. The page links to a biography of each president and provides some key facts about each president including their home states, their ages at inauguration and their religions. Abraham Lincoln\u2019s religion is listed as \u201cLiberal.\u201d (Infoplease.com changed this statement after The Daily Caller exposed the webpage.) Any math student who surfs over to the Infoplease.com biography of Ronald Reagan is in for a treat. The page duly explains that Reagan\u2019s \u201c\u2018supply side\u2019 economic program\u201d of \u201ctax cuts and sharp reductions in government spending\u201d led to \u201cthe worst recession in 40 years\u201d and a \u201cconstantly growing budget deficit.\u201d The roaring economy and the huge plunge in both inflation and unemployment that ensued rate nary a mention.\n\nThe InfoPlease biography of Reagan recommended by Common Core to \u2014 say again, math students \u2014 begins:\n\nRonald Wilson Reagan rode to the presidency in 1980 on a tide of resurgent right-wing sentiment among an electorate longing for a distant, simpler era\u2026. In the 1980 election battle against Jimmy Carter, Reagan broadened his appeal by espousing moderate policies, gaining much of his support from disaffected Democrats and blue-collar workers.\n\nIn other words, Reagan was elected because America suddenly wanted to go backwards to a \u201cdistant, simpler era\u201d and to get elected the most famously conservative politician of the day began \u201cespousing moderate policies\u201d because, don\u2019t you know, the country can\u2019t elect a conservative unless they moderate themselves. Having, as they say, been there and done that in the Reagan White House, I have no recollection of the President looking sternly over his reading glasses and saying that \u201cwe\u2019re going to take America back to a distant, simpler era, just like I promised in the campaign.\u201d\n\nContrast this with the same site\u2019s bio of Barack Obama.\n\nAfter a historic and bruising 22-month long campaign, Sen. Barack Obama was elected the 44th president of the United States on Nov. 4, 2008. He prevailed over Sen. John McCain in what was probably the most pivotal US election since World War II\u2026.\n\nThe bio goes on to refer to \u201cthe infamous Guantanamo Bay prison.\u201d\n\nWhile Reagan\u2019s economic policies are presented as a failure, with, as the DC notes, Reagan\u2019s \u201croaring economy and the huge plunge in both inflation and unemployment that ensued\u201d rating \u201cnary a mention\u201d there is nothing similar in the Obama bio, which blandly notes that \u201cthe recovery from the 2008 recession had stalled with job growth continuing to come up short\u2026\u201d No word on this being the worst recovery of modern times is to be found, the 92 million Americans not working, the surge in Americans now dependent on food stamps and so on.\n\nTake note of something else in that DC article. There are \u201cCommon Core aligned lessons\u201d at a website called Illuminations, which is \u201can outfit created by the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM) and financially supported by the Verizon Foundation.\u201d The NCTM, reports the DC with a sly humor, is \u201cheavily focused on the newly mathematical concept of social justice.\u201d Yes, that\u2019s right, a trip to the website of this group of math teachers connected to Common Core reveals an obsession with the far left catechism of \u201csocial justice.\u201d\n\nFollow one of the 130 links to \u201csocial justice\u201d at a site supposedly all about math and you come up with \u201cmathematical\u201d concepts like this about \u201csocial justice mathematics\u201d:\n\nEducators increasingly recognize the important role that mathematics teaching plays in helping students to understand and overcome social injustice and inequality.\n\nSo one of the major communications companies in America has joined together with the NCTM to push the leftist agenda of \u201csocial justice\u201d on America\u2019s kids \u2014 through Common Core.\n\nLet\u2019s go back to all these college commencement controversies. To Brandeis, which rejected Ayaan Hirsi Ali because \u201cwe cannot overlook that certain of her past statements are inconsistent with Brandeis University\u2019s core values.\u201d And one of those core values? Says Brandeis on its website: \u201cThe concern with social justice speaks to the core educational commitments of Brandeis.\u201d What about Rutgers? Yes, the school whose faculty and students caused such a ruckus over former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice that Rice decided to withdraw also is big on teaching \u201csocial justice.\u201d Like Brandeis, Rutgers wants its graduates to go forth into the world viewing social justice as an important value. Says the school in its description of \u201cSocial Justice 904\u201d:\n\nThe social justice minor is designed to introduce students to the complexity of social justice issue, cultivate their capacity to identify key determinants of structural inequities, familiarize them with various social justice practices and strategies, and prepare them for advocacy and activism to address these pressing issues.\n\nLast but not least here is Smith College. Which just did the same thing to International Monetary Fund chief Christine Lagarde as Brandeis and Rutgers did to Hirsi Ali and Condi Rice. A fuss was raised that Lagarde was using the IMF for \u201cthe strengthening of imperialist and patriarchal systems that oppress and abuse women worldwide.\u201d\n\nSmith, by the way, features \u201cthe Program for the Study of Women and Gender\u201d that \u201crequires inquiry into the construction and operation of power relations, social inequalities and resistances to them in both national and transnational contexts.\u201d\n\nNow.\n\nLet\u2019s go back to Common Core and Glenn Beck\u2019s point on Common Core: Common Core, he said, is all about \u201ccontrol and conform.\u201d\n\nBut how? How does one accomplish this?\n\nThe answer, and there\u2019s no newsflash here, is that liberalism runs academia and the American Education Industrial Complex. There is no better example of \u201ccontrol and conform\u201d than Brandeis, Rutgers, and Smith. Sheep-like, students at these three institutions are routinely and casually indoctrinated in the Ways of the Left. Social justice being but one. This has been going on for ages in academia.\n\nThe real reason Common Core is inducing such visceral reaction is because an increasing number of Americans see it as nationalizing leftist education. As the examples cited above illustrate, when the math teachers are focused on teaching \u201csocial justice mathematics\u201d and the kids are sent to presidential biographies that paint Ronald Reagan as a crazed right-winger who only won the presidency because Americans wanted to go backwards to a \u201cdistant and simpler era\u201d \u2014 but Barack Obama is lionized for \u201ca historic and bruising 22-month long campaign\u201d that would end the \u201cinfamous\u201d Guantanamo prison for terrorists \u2014 this isn\u2019t education. It\u2019s indoctrination.\n\nWhich brings finally to former Florida Governor Jeb Bush\u2019s insistent support for Common Core, and ditto that of New Jersey\u2019s Chris Christie. Bush appeared in New York the other day and defended Common Core. Saying, among other things, that America must have a \u201cwholesale transformation of our educational system.\u201d\n\nWell aside that this makes Bush sound like Obama \u2014 the President having campaigned on a platform to \u201ctransform\u201d America. Bush is either uncaring or uncomprehending of the reality left-wing politics plays in the day-to-day of American education, a tie illustrated with Common Core, Verizon, and the left-leaning NCTM\u2019s push for social justice mathematics. Bush gave a talk awhile back at the Excellence in Education\u2019s 2013 National Summit on Education Reform in Boston. In which he derided opposition to Common Core as \u201cconspiracy theories\u201d and dismissed federalism in education as \u201cthe hodgepodge of dumbed-down state standards that have created mediocrity in our schools.\u201d If ever there were a slam at the very concept of limited government, federalism and states as \u201claboratories of democracy,\u201d that remark is it. The import of what Bush is saying is that the federal government knows best. And if liberals are indoctrinating kids through agenda-driven lessons on possessive nouns or social justice mathematics or slanted presidential bios, with the assistance of corporations like Verizon \u2014 hey, no big deal. The entire country should be indoctrinated like this, one kid at a time.\n\nIn fact, this kind of thing has been going since long before Common Core. How do you think all those kids at Brandeis, Rutgers, and Smith (not to mention their professors) came to think \u2014 in uniform \u2014 the way they do? There\u2019s no \u201cconspiracy\u201d here. To suggest this as Bush does is another example of the Progressive Republican mimicking Obama, in this case with the use of a straw man that any sensible person knows is perfectly untrue if not silly. The heart of the issue here is about a left-wing educational culture that needs no prompting or secret meetings to teach social justice math or illustrate possessive nouns with sentences that laud the idea that \u201can individual\u2019s wants are less important than the nation\u2019s well-being\u201d and that \u201cgovernment officials\u2019 commands must be obeyed by all.\u201d\n\nBy the time the Republican Party gets to 2016, candidates like Bush and Christie \u2014 Common Core supporters both \u2014 are going to have to explain to the party\u2019s base just why it would be a good idea to do to education what Obamacare has done to health care.\n\nIt will be a pretty tough sell.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.\n\n\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"fb": {"pages": 1742097289343962}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "generator": "WordPress 4.4"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3fce\"", "article_summary": "Let\u2019s go back to Common Core and Glenn Beck\u2019s point on Common Core: Common Core, he said, is all about \u201ccontrol and conform.\u201dBut how?\nYou could, in fact, call Common Core Obamacare for Education.\nSays the school in its description of \u201cSocial Justice 904\u201d:The social justice minor is designed to introduce students to the complexity of social justice issue, cultivate their capacity to identify key determinants of structural inequities, familiarize them with various social justice practices and strategies, and prepare them for advocacy and activism to address these pressing issues.\nCommon Core.\nHere are the six sentences, the \u201cwordy\u201d sentence first and the grammatically correct version second, exactly as sequentially presented by Common Core."}
