CNBC's Bertha Coombs and Dan Mangan, CNBC Business News, discuss the potential big price hikes in Obamacare plans for 2017 and what it could mean for consumers.

Obamacare plan customers should brace for sticker shock when the administration posts insurers' preliminary rate requests for 2017 this week.

Health plans are asking for sharp price increases, after suffering big losses on exchanges in the last two years. Regulators caution that these are preliminary requests and final rates could look a lot different.

Insurers cite rising drug costs and patients who utilize a lot of medical services for the price-hike requests, which range from 17 percent in New York, and more than 20 percent in Virginia, to 30 percent rate increase requests from Oregon's largest insurers.
