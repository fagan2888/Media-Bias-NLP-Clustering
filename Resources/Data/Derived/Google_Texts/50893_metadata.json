Unless lawmakers allow his department to borrow more money, Treasury Secretary Jack Lew has warned that as of about November 3, the U.S. government will begin operating on a cash basis \u2013 something that could lead to a first-in-history default on the financial obligations of the United States.\n\nThe November 3 date, however, suggests that everything will be just fine so long as something happens by 11:59 on November 2. An announcement by the Treasury Department on Thursday, though, showed why that is manifestly not the case.\n\nRelated: What\u2019s Really Driving the Stock Market\u2019s Big Rebound Rally?\n\nThe Treasury sells billions of dollars in government-backed securities every week, from short-term bills to medium term notes, up to the 30-year \u201clong bond.\u201d Sometimes this is done to take on more debt, other times it is done as a management tool, allowing the Department to distribute the government\u2019s obligations over different maturities as cost and need require.\n\nThere is a broad and deep market for Treasury instruments, which are seen as virtually risk-free. Investment funds, insurance firms, banks, and other businesses rely on them. They also expect them to be available on a fairly regular schedule.\n\nThat schedule has now been interrupted, at least in the case of 2-year notes. The Treasury announced Thursday that it was cancelling its auction of the securities scheduled for next Tuesday out of concern that it wouldn\u2019t be able to settle the transaction the following week because of \u201cdebt limit constraints.\u201d\n\nThe decision, and the market expectation that more of such cancellations could be on the way, is already having an impact, the department said.\n\nRelated: Congress Asleep at the Switch as the Debt Ceiling Looms\n\n\u201cThe current debt limit impasse is also now adversely affecting the operation of government financing, increasing federal government borrowing costs, reducing the Treasury bill supply, and increasing the operational risk associated with holding a lower cash balance,\u201d the department said in a statement.\n\nThe decision to cancel the two-year auction, the Department said, will allow some other auctions to be held as scheduled.\n\n\u201cTreasury believes that postponing the auction for the 2-year note poses less risk for market functioning than postponing the 5-year or 7-year note offering,\u201d the statement said. \u201cOnce the debt limit impasse is resolved, Treasury will announce a rescheduling of the 2-year note auction.\u201d\n\nThe markets appear to be reacting to the possibility that the federal government could be unable to pay its debts by increasing the interest rates investors demand on Treasury instruments, although from a very low base.\n\nInvestment managers say they are concerned about possible future cancellations of additional debt auctions throwing the market into confusion.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The November 3 date the Treasury Department has set for when the country will start having to prioritize its bill suggests that everything will be just fine so long as Congress raises the debt ceiling by 11:59 on November 2.
