But it has no tradition of disciplined party membership or detailed party platforms. Two main pro-reform parties were banned after the 2009 election that led to hardline President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's second-term win. Months of anti-government protests followed.\n\nIn major cities like Tehran, two main groups have emerged but some candidates are backed by more than one group and allegiances often shift.\n\n- The United Front of Principlists: The biggest hardline group, encompassing loyalists to Khamenei, emphasizing Islamic social values and support a free market economy. This group is supported by the establishment's backbone - influential clerics, the elite Revolutionary Guards and powerful bazaar merchants.\n\nThe coalition includes various parties like the Devotees and Path-seekers of the Islamic Revolution, the Front of Islamic Revolution Stability, Islamic Coalition Party and the Association of Combatant Clergy.\n\nThey are trying to agree on a united lists for major cities, like Tehran with 30 seats. But they still remain split.\n\n- Some pragmatic principlists, most notably parliament speaker Ali Larijani, fall in the middle of Iran's political spectrum, working with both principlists and pro-reform parties.\n\n- The Pro-Reform Front: The alliance is made up of members of dozens of parties, including the Union of Islamic Iran People Party, Nedaye Iranian, Iranian-Islamic Freedom Party, Association of Combatant Clerics, Islamic Labor Party and Moderation and Development Party.\n\nAs most of prominent pro-reform candidates have been disqualified, the main pro-reform parties have agreed on a joint list of candidates, the \u201cAlliance of Reformists and Government Supporters\u201d, which will include women and young candidates.\n\n- Independent candidates in small cities and towns could attract more support as the vote in such places would depend on the reputation of candidates and personal contacts with voters.\n\n* THE VOTE AND THE RESULT\n\n- There are about 50 million eligible voters, who must be over 18 years, in the country of around 80 million people.\n\n- All ballots will be counted manually so the final result may not be announced for three days, although partial results may appear sooner.\n\n- Iran\u2019s constitution mandates five reserved seats in parliament for religious minorities.\n\n* CAMPAIGNING\n\n- The parliamentary election campaign will be from Feb. 18-24.\n\n* A NEW PARLIAMENT\n\n- Iran's parliament does not determine policy in areas such as Iran's foreign affairs, but it plays a major role in economic policy and winning a majority is critical for factions that jockey for position before the 2017 presidential race.\n\nThe pro-reform alliance is seeking a greater share of the parliament, where hardliners have dominated for more than a decade.\n\n(Writing by Parisa Hafezi; Editing by Dominic Evans)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Political infighting has intensified among Iran's faction-ridden elite since a nuclear", "title": "Factbox: Parties and politics in Iran's parliamentary election", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/02/18/Factbox-Parties-and-politics-Irans-parliamentary-election", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/iran-revolution-election_2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/02/18/Factbox-Parties-and-politics-Irans-parliamentary-election", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/iran-revolution-election_2.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Political infighting has intensified among Iran's faction-ridden elite since a nuclear", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Leading pro-reform parties and politicians have criticized the disqualifications, but say that they have no intention of boycotting the vote.\nFollowing are some facts about Iran's 10th parliamentary election since the 1979 Islamic Revolution.\nTwo main pro-reform parties were banned after the 2009 election that led to hardline President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's second-term win.\nThe coalition includes various parties like the Devotees and Path-seekers of the Islamic Revolution, the Front of Islamic Revolution Stability, Islamic Coalition Party and the Association of Combatant Clergy.\n- Some pragmatic principlists, most notably parliament speaker Ali Larijani, fall in the middle of Iran's political spectrum, working with both principlists and pro-reform parties."}
