In addition, contrary to some assertions, VA health care is unaffected by the Affordable Care Act, commonly referred to as Obamacare.\n\n\u201cThey can save all that money\u201d merely by signing up, he said of eligible veterans.\n\nAmong the reasons for the expanded eligibility are recognition that the government was slow to acknowledge health issues related to Agent Orange exposure in Vietnam and a desire to avoid a similar situation with Gulf War Syndrome.\n\nIn addition, the VA system is gaining capacity as veterans from the World War II era are no longer consuming VA services.\n\nIn the case of Vietnam veterans, while official recognition of the adverse health effects of Agent Orange was slow to develop, now 13 separate disease diagnoses automatically qualify Vietnam veterans as being affected by Agent Orange \u2014 no questions asked.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t question why you got it or how you got it,\u201d Ziemann said.\n\nThe 13 qualifying illnesses are listed on the VA website \u2014 www.va.gov \u2014 as is other information about VA benefits.\n\nGulf War Syndrome is not as clearly defined and includes various neuromuscular and gastrointestinal afflictions. Trying to keep it in check is the chief reason veterans who were in theater during that war between 1990 and 1998 are now covered by VA health benefits regardless of income level.\n\n\u201cWe want to ensure the American taxpayer we\u2019re not going to make the same mistakes we made in Vietnam [with Agent Orange],\u201d Ziemann said.\n\nEasy to apply\n\nHonorably discharged veterans can apply for VA health and other benefits by filling out a short form and providing a copy of their DD214, which is their discharge form. The form is available at www.archives.gov for veterans who do not have one.\n\n\u201cThey need that DD214,\u201d Ziemann said. \u201cThat\u2019s their ticket. Without it, we turn them away.\u201d\n\nHealth benefit applications and other forms are also available at the Glenwood Springs clinic, said Jenell Hilderbrand, a registered nurse there.\n\nAs simple as it may be to apply for benefits, Ziemann said he recognizes there is nothing easy about it for some veterans.\n\n\u201cIt triggers their PTSD [post-traumatic stress disorder]\u201d just to come into a VA clinic, he said.\n\nIronically, that is one of the conditions the VA can treat, and he encourages veterans to overcome their reluctance and discover how the agency might be able to help them.\n\nMany veterans also may qualify for up to $2,600 per month in service-connected disability compensation as well, he pointed out, yet some misconstrue its intention or feel like they don\u2019t deserve it. In reality, it covers everything from service-related partial hearing loss, which Ziemann said is common, to more serious injuries.\n\n\u201cCompensation is a much-misunderstood thing,\u201d he said. It\u2019s really as simple as, \u201cbecause of your service, these things happened ... we\u2019re going to compensate you for that,\u201d he explained.\n\nApplying for compensation is more complicated than applying for VA health care, he said, and right now there is a backlog of applications, but it is still a relatively straightforward process that he urges injured veterans to explore.\n\n\u2018Skype on steroids\u2019\n\nStatistically, the Glenwood Springs clinic has a larger pool of potential patients. According to the U.S. Census, as of 2010 there were nearly 6,300 veterans in the three counties the clinic serves. More than half of them live in Garfield County.\n\nPrior to the opening of the teleclinic, local veterans had to travel to Grand Junction, while now many health care \u201cvisits\u201d can be made via the sophisticated teleconferencing equipment at the clinic.\n\nThe initial consultation is still performed by a doctor in Grand Junction, but after that, many situations can be handled by the nursing team at the clinic and via teleconference with doctors in Grand Junction and specialists in other locations.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like Skype on steroids,\u201d Ziemann said of the teleconferencing equipment, which includes not only high-definition cameras and large flat screen TVs, but also various medical monitoring devices that transmit vital signs and other data.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s as close to being there as humanly possible,\u201d he said.\n\nIf a full scale VA clinic were approved for Glenwood Springs, it would include onsite doctors, and perhaps mental health services, and would be capable of servicing more patients.\n\n\u201cA lot of good things can happen if we get this clinic,\u201d he said.\n\nThat could take a while, though. First the agency will have to prepare a formal request, and then Congress ultimately would have to approve it, Ziemann said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "GLENWOOD SPRINGS \u2014 In just three years, the Veterans Affairs Telehealth Outreach Clinic here has attracted enough patients to qualify for full clinic status, and recent VA rule changes", "pubdate": 20140123, "og": {"url": "http://www.PostIndependent.com/news/9416136-113/veterans-clinic-health-ziemann", "image": {"identifier": "http://www.PostIndependent.com/csp/mediapool/sites/dt.common.streams.StreamServer.cls?STREAMOID=f7ArUOl7HXCzIgjwXfup6s$daE2N3K4ZzOUsqbU5sYvUYi8_z_UWzBGMysTe8WKWWCsjLu883Ygn4B49Lvm9bPe2QeMKQdVeZmXF$9l$4uCZ8QDXhaHEp3rvzXRJFdy0KqPHLoMevcTLo3h8xh70Y6N_U_CryOsw6FTOdKL_jpQ-&CONTENTTYPE=image/jpeg", "type": "image/jpeg"}, "site_name": "The Post Independent", "description": "GLENWOOD SPRINGS \u2014 In just three years, the Veterans Affairs Telehealth Outreach Clinic here has attracted enough patients to qualify for full clinic status, and recent VA rule changes", "title": "Glenwood Springs VA health clinic grows quickly | PostIndependent.com"}, "twitter": {"site": "@GlenwoodPI", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 502123656511425}, "tout": {"article": {"id": 9416136}}, "keywords": "CLINIC, VETERANS, HEALTH, GLENWOOD, ZIEMANN, SPRINGS, CARE, GRAND, BENEFITS, GOV", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "In addition, contrary to some assertions, VA health care is unaffected by the Affordable Care Act, commonly referred to as Obamacare.\nThe 13 qualifying illnesses are listed on the VA website \u2014 www.va.gov \u2014 as is other information about VA benefits.\nIf a full scale VA clinic were approved for Glenwood Springs, it would include onsite doctors, and perhaps mental health services, and would be capable of servicing more patients.\n\u201cIt triggers their PTSD [post-traumatic stress disorder]\u201d just to come into a VA clinic, he said.\nIn fact, said Ziemann, all veterans who were \u201cboots on the ground\u201d in Vietnam or Gulf War I (from 1990-1998) now qualify for VA health benefits."}
