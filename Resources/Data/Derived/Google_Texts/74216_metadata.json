Burwell Wednesday. The Eternal Word Television Network is fighting the Obamacare mandate which requires it to provide insurance that covers contraceptives for employees.\n\nMother Mary Angelica founded EWTN out of a garage in 1981, with the hopes of creating a catholic network that could help people grow in their faith. Now it is the largest Catholic media organization in the world, reaching 230 million homes in 144 countries.\n\nThe religious nonprofit cites its religious beliefs and says it is being forced to choose between serving God and paying a hefty fine. If it loses, it will have to pay $13 million.\n\nDaniel Blomberg, legal counsel representing EWTN, told The Daily Caller News Foundation that the judges Tuesday seemed to see recent Supreme Court precedent in Hobby Lobby v. Burwell as protecting religious liberty broadly. The Supreme Court ruled that the government could not force Hobby Lobby to pay for insurance that provided contraceptive coverage against its religious beliefs.\n\nThe EWTN case is very similar, though EWTN is a nonprofit.\n\nBlomberg said the government could set dangerous precedent in this case. He told TheDCNF that a win in the case would bolster the government\u2019s practice of arbitrarily deciding which groups are religious enough to receive a religious exemption without providing any evidence.\n\n\u201cThe government is assuming that EWTN employees aren\u2019t religious enough to receive the religious exemption that other religious groups have received,\u201d Blomberg told TheDCNF.\n\nIn the case of EWTN, he says the government has failed to produce any evidence that EWTN is not religious enough to receive an exemption, or that there is a pressing government interest for forcing EWTN to provide the contraceptive coverage.\n\n\u201cHere we have government guessing about people\u2019s religious beliefs and handing out religious exemptions based on its own guesswork,\u201d Blomberg said.\n\nHe said the other dangerous precedent this case could set is that the government could force religious groups to accept \u201caccommodations\u201d to the rule that still violate their beliefs.\n\n\u201cThe government is going to play a game of degrees where it says, \u2018first i\u2019m going to make you do something extremely bad, and then we\u2019ll come up with a fake accommodation that still makes religious believers violate their faith,'\u201d Blomberg explained.\n\nThe government is arguing that EWTN will not have to directly pay for contraceptive care because a third party will technically pay for it. But EWTN says this would still force it to provide the coverage on the healthcare plan, and thus compromise its beliefs.\n\n\u201cBeing a woman in this business is not easy,\u201d Angelica said in a video pleading EWTN\u2019s case. \u201cBeing a nun is even worse.\u201d\n\nEWTN is now run by lay Catholics. Blomberg said a decision should come down by May.\n\nWATCH:\n\nFollow Casey on Twitter and like him on Facebook\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
