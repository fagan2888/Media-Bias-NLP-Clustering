John Kasich speaks on the phone with staff after a 2011 vote in the state legislature in Columbus. (Melina Mara/ The Washington Post)\n\nBatchelder was won over by Kasich\u2019s conviction that this was the right thing to do, especially for a state in extremis fiscally. The move infuriated many of their colleagues, who saw hubris bordering on illegality. The board approved the federal funds by a vote of 5 to 2.\n\n\u201cHe jams through Medicaid expansion at the same time he\u2019s saying, \u2018Join me in repealing the Affordable Care Act,\u2019 \u201d Tom Zawistowski, an Ohio tea party leader, told the Columbus Dispatch. \u201cIt\u2019s schizophrenic.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou guys are practically spooning, you and President Obama,\u201d Laura Ingraham said in a Fox News interview with Kasich in November 2013. \u201cThat\u2019s amazing. Are you BFFs for real?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m the CEO of this state,\u201d Kasich responded. \u201cI have a chance to bring [$13 billion] out of Washington to me, to the people here in my state who need this help.\u201d\n\nThen and now, the governor talks about people in the shadows: the poor, the mentally ill, the drug-addicted. His compassion is rooted in the trauma of losing his parents in 1987, when their Oldsmobile was hit by a drunk driver as they pulled out of a Burger King not far from home.\n\nYou have a window of opportunity here, his parents\u2019 pastor, the Rev. Stu Boehmig, told the distraught 35-year-old congressman. A life-shaking event creates the space for personal reexamination.\n\n\u201cPeople\u2019s hearts either get hardened and cold and shriveled and angry and bitter, or they get soft and open and pliable and moldable,\u201d says Boehmig, who remains a part of the governor\u2019s life. \u201cAnd I think John\u2019s heart got opened.\u201d\n\nFrom that moment, Kasich was transformed. With the curiosity and fervor of the Catholic altar boy he once was, he joined a Bible study group in Washington. He went searching for God and found him: in the Anglican Church. In his wife, Karen. In his twin daughters. In a brother dealing with mental health issues. In the triumphs and struggles of his constituents.\n\nHe can be less compassionate on other issues, some Ohioans say. He restricted food-stamp access and slashed education funding. He opposes resettling Syrian refugees in Ohio. He supports a state bill that would defund Planned Parenthood.\n\nBut on Medicaid expansion, he was certain he was right. Over half a million low-income Ohioans \u2014 including children, the mentally ill and the drug-addicted \u2014 now have access to health insurance.\n\nUsing the Controlling Board \u201cwas a brilliant move,\u201d says Democrat Gayle Channing Tenenbaum, a child-and-family advocate who has navigated Ohio politics for 40 years. \u201cWe have always respectfully disagreed about two or three things, a tax policy being one of them. But there\u2019s nothing made up about his faith and why he believed we should do Medicaid expansion.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "John Kasich broke with the GOP on expanding Medicaid.
