He chose the latter and it cost him dearly.\n\nLiberalism, as an ideology, insists that government can do good and great things for the people and the world, if the people running the government are smart liberals. The Democratic Party says the exact same thing. But liberalism is an ideal, while the Democratic Party is that ideal\u2019s representative here in the real world, and in the real world political parties disappoint.\n\nJust to be clear \u2014 and to avoid a lot of \u201cOh, yeah? What about Republicans?!\u201d responses \u2014 this is true of the GOP, too. Conservative ideology holds that government should only do those things that only government can and should do, and that list is very short. For instance, government shouldn\u2019t be in the business of playing favorites in the economy. It shouldn\u2019t \u201cpick winners and losers.\u201d Rather, it should be a fair umpire and let competition work its magic. Alas, Republican politicians routinely fall short of this ideal, preferring to be pro-business rather than pro-market. That, in so many words, is why the Export-Import Bank of the United States is immortal.\n\nBut this was supposed to be liberalism\u2019s moment. This was supposed to be a new Progressive Era. Obama came into office vowing to be \u201ctransformative\u201d just like Ronald Reagan \u2014 the difference being that Reagan ushered in an era of skepticism about government, and Obama wanted to usher in an era of hope and idealism about all the wonderful things government can do. In Obama\u2019s mind this put him at odds with Republicans. And in a partisan sense it obviously did.\n\nBut as a matter of policy, Obama\u2019s real challenge came from within. Government\u2019s failures in recent years cannot be laid at the feet of the Republican Party but at the feet of the Democratic Party. If you were to ask most serious liberal policy wonks how they would make government more effective, a good number of their answers would involve doing things the Democratic base of the party would never, ever allow.\n\nSmart liberalism has no love for bureaucratic inefficiencies. There\u2019s nothing inherent to liberalism that says public-sector unions should have a stranglehold on the government payroll the way they do. FDR loathed the idea of government workers unionizing.\n\nThe biggest threat to job security at most federal agencies is death. Incompetence, negligence and redundancy are rarely seen as cause for termination. In 2010, the dismissal rate for 168,000 federal workers in the Washington, D.C., area was 0.26 percent. That\u2019s point-two-six, not 26 percent or 2.6 percent. Local governments are little better. Short of murder or pedophilia, there\u2019s almost nothing a tenured public school teacher can do that will get him or her summarily fired. Read all the Keynes, Niebuhr, Schlesinger, Lippmann, Galbraith you can. You\u2019ll find nothing in there that even hints this is the way things ought to be.\n\nIf Obama wanted to restore faith in government, he would have pushed for mercilessly firing bad government workers and ending stupid government programs. And while he paid a little lip service to such things, his priorities were all in the other direction. That is because he had to dance with the girl that brung him. The Democratic Party isn\u2019t simply the party of government, it is the party for government.\n\nThat\u2019s why his stimulus package was top-heavy with bailouts for federal programs, state governments and public-sector workers. When he finally learned that there are no such things as \u201cshovel-ready jobs,\u201d it should have prompted him to ask, \u201cWhy not?\u201d The answer would have led him to reforms that undoubtedly would have helped the American people \u2014 and the cause of liberalism! \u2014 but hurt his own base in the Democratic Party.\n\nOn Obama\u2019s watch, we\u2019ve seen horrifying incompetence, malfeasance or skullduggery at the Department of Veterans Affairs, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the IRS, DOJ, GAO and HHS. Republicans didn\u2019t create the fiasco of the Affordable Care Act rollout; the architects of Obamacare did that all by themselves.\n\nJust this week, the wheels have come off the bus at the Secret Service. You can denounce the anti-government rhetoric of Rand Paul, Ted Cruz and the Koch brothers all you like, but they didn\u2019t cause any of these spectacular failures. If the CDC screws up its efforts to contain Ebola, it will be a far more powerful, lasting and damaging indictment of government competence than any floor speech by Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY).\n\nObama set out to restore faith in government and liberalism. He ended up throwing them both under the bus for the sake of his party.\n\nTribune Content Agency\n\nJonah Goldberg is a fellow at the American Enterprise Institute and editor-at-large of National Review Online.\n\ngoldbergcolumn@gmail.com\n\nTwitter @JonahNRO\n\nJoin in the discussion on the Chicago Tribune Editorial Board\u2019s Facebook page or on Twitter by following @Trib_Ed_Board.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Obama throws liberalism under the bus", "date": "2014-10-03", "googlebot": "index", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Chicago Tribune", "author": "Chicago Tribune", "og": {"site_name": "chicagotribune.com", "description": "President Barack Obama had a choice between liberalism and the Democratic Party.
