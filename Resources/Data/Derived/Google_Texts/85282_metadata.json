The additional 3.8% on all or part of a tax payer's net investment income pays for the Medicaid expansion that Obamacare ushered in.\n\nSeveral strategies can reduce the amount of income taxed to pay for the Medicaid expansion under President Obama's health care law. Image: Bloomberg\n\nAdvisers have a variety of options that can help clients avoid or reduce that tax, says Samuel A. Donaldson, a professor at Georgia State University College of Law in Atlanta, Georgia, at NAPFA's spring conference.\n\nThe following strategies can also help reduce clients\u2019 adjusted gross incomes \u2014 and lower their standard tax bills:\n\n\u2022 Harvest losses\n\nDonaldson suggests offsetting gains in taxable brokerage accounts with investment losses from the same or similar accounts.\n\n\u2022 Fulfill charitable pledges with marketable securities\n\n\"I can\u2019t believe how many wealthy people give cash. Don\u2019t do that. Give stock!\" Donaldson says. If marketable securities go directly to a charity, they don\u2019t appear as part of the donor's gross income, he explains. But if a client sells the securities and donates the cash, that taxpayer has net investment income \u2014 exactly what the law is designed to tax, and part of adjusted gross income to boot.\n\n\u2022 Become an active investor\n\nIf a client has rental income from real estate, getting more involved in running those rentals moves the client from being a passive investor to active investor, according to Donaldson. Income from active investments isn't subject to the 3.8% Medicaid tax.\n\n\u2022 Collect on a property sale over time\n\nReceiving the proceeds from a property sale over multiple years can spread out the total tax bill as well, Donaldson says. This approach also may keep the client below the additional tax threshold.\n\n\u2022 Max out contributions\n\nMaxing out contributions to tax-deferred retirement accounts such as IRAs and 401(k) plans is another way to stay below the tax surcharge threshold.\n\n\u2022 Accelerate business deductions\n\nClients who own businesses should consider accelerating deductions and deferring income, where they can. \u201cPrepay business insurance and rent,\u201d Donaldson says.\n\nDonaldson also points out that rental real estate, as well as oil and gas properties offer bigger deductions than many other assets, pushing down clients\u2019 overall tax bills.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"displaytag": "Tax planning", "sailthru.author": "Ingrid Case", "description": "These smart strategies can reduce the amount of income subject to the tax, says Samuel A.
