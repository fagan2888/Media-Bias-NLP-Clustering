(Scott Olson/Getty Images)\n\nThe Oath Keepers are many things to many people. For one fervent believer, it\u2019s about the Constitution. For another, it\u2019s about a .50-caliber Bushmaster and his right to carry it. Others talk of fear: fear America has become a security state. Fear President Obama has become a dictator. Fear the Oath Keepers are needed now more than ever \u2014 especially in Ferguson, Mo.\n\nThere, on the rooftops and streets, members of this little-known national group now stand guard, ready, they say, to protect residents and the Constitution against forces known and unknown. They wear military fatigues and speak of lending a sense of security to the bewildered community, battered by national media attention and months of protest. According to reports, they\u2019ve materialized around a series of second-story apartments near the Ferguson Police Department, confusing onlookers.\n\n\u201cI opened the window and said, \u2018Hey, can I help you?'\u201d resident Greg Hildebrand told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch he asked one Oath Keeper. \u201cI am in the middle of a difficult spot. I feel a lot better having those guys on the roof.\u201d\n\nProtesters in Ferguson, Mo., say it will take more than officer Darren Wilson's resignation to appease their demands. (Reuters)\n\nLocal cops didn\u2019t agree. Over the weekend, they threatened keepers of the oath with arrest, forcing the men to abandon their positions, but not the group\u2019s founding tenets. \u201cIt\u2019s a really broad group of citizens, and I\u2019m sure their motivations are all different,\u201d one member named Sam Andrews told the New York Times. \u201cIn many of them, there\u2019s probably a sense of patriotism. But I think in most of them, there\u2019s probably something that they probably don\u2019t even recognize: that we have a moral obligation to protect the weakest among us.\u201d\n\nJohn Karriman. a volunteer from Oath Keepers, speaks to a protester as he stands guard on the rooftop of a business late last week.

With a reported but unverified membership of 35,000, Oath Keepers came into being after founder Stewart Rhodes wrote a 2008 manifesto calling for men and women to protect a complacent America besieged by what he described as dictatorial leaders. \u201cIf a police state comes to America, it will ultimately be in your hands,\u201d Rhodes, a Yale Law School graduate, wrote. \u201cThat is a harsh reality, but you had better come to terms with it now, and resolve to not let it happen on your watch.\u201d\n\nMedia reports have characterized the group as right-wing and deeply conspiratorial in outlook, but that doesn\u2019t quite get at the complex forces and anxieties driving it. Oath Keepers take inspiration from both the far right and the far left. Members preach the gospel of the Constitution, but also don the mask of Guy Fawkes, the fabled Englishman executed in 1606 for plotting to kill King James I.\n\nThe group\u2019s membership, which reportedly spills across racial and regional lines, suggests common ground among fringe groups on either side of the political spectrum. \u201cIn the months I\u2019ve spent getting to know the Oath Keepers,\u201d wrote journalist Justine Sharrock in Mother Jones, \u201cI\u2019ve toggled between viewing them either as potentially dangerous conspiracy theorists or as crafty intellectuals with the savvy to rally politicians to their side. The answer, I came to realize, is that they cover the whole spectrum.\u201d\n\n\n\nA volunteer from Oath Keepers guards a business last week in Ferguson.

The group enumerates its position not in the affirmative declarative, but in the negative. \u201cWe will NOT obey orders to disarm the American people,\u201d says the group\u2019s \u201cDeclaration of Orders We Will Not Obey.\u201d \u201cWe will NOT obey orders to conduct warrantless searches of the American people. \u2026 We will NOT obey orders to impose martial law or a \u2018state of emergency\u2019 on the state.\u201d\n\nNumerous dissident groups have found voice in the uncertainties of the economic recession \u2014 birthers, truthers, Texas militia \u2014 but the Oath Keepers are notable because many members are military men, cops or emergency personnel. Some of them are even still employed in those roles.\n\nMembers distrust just about everything: mass-media narratives, global warming science and vaccinations. Others contend the United States government not only planned the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, but has since leveraged them to enact a shadowy campaign to terrify residents into forsaking their freedom, guns and privacy. Edward Snowden\u2019s revelations of mass surveillance have only emboldened that position.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had enough of following orders,\u201d Eric Harrell, a South Florida police officer who\u2019s also an Oath Keeper, told the Miami New Times last year. \u201cI woke up. I\u2019ve been living a lie. I\u2019ve evolved.\u201d Harrell, who meets with other cop Oath Keepers, was arrested last year after he refused to remove his Guy Fawkes mask amid a solitary protest of Obamacare at a busy Broward County intersection.\n\nHe derives many of his talking points from Alex Jones, a radio show host who runs the alternative news Web site infowars.com and often gives space to the discontent coursing through the Oath Keepers movement. \u201cI think the Oath Keepers is one of the best things to happen to America since the American revolution,\u201d Jones wrote.\u201dThere are two camps of critics of Oath Keepers: the ignorant people who believe everything they read, and the cunning tyrants who want the treasonous and lawless federal government to march ahead unopposed.\u201d\n\nFerguson has inflamed unease among Oath Keepers. Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon (D) last month declared a state of emergency and called the National Guard to Ferguson. But the Oath Keepers said those forces weren\u2019t protecting the people against rioters who have torched shops, smashed windows and burned police cars.\n\n\u201cWhen they\u2019re here, there\u2019s definitely a weight lifted off our shoulders,\u201d one man who owns a Chinese restaurant told The Times. \u201cI\u2019d be lying if I said otherwise.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Many of its members are former military men or cops or emergency personnel.
