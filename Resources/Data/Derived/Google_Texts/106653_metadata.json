He won\u2019t admit as much \u2013 just two days ago he insisted to reporters that \u201cmy interest is in the past, not the future. I\u2019m trying to figure out what happened to four Americans in Benghazi.\u201d That\u2019s a noble statement of purpose, but it\u2019s completely unconnected to what Gowdy is actually doing.\n\nGowdy made that statement after he and his committee had spent several hours interviewing longtime Hillary Clinton associate Sidney Blumenthal about emails Blumenthal sent to the former Secretary of State after the attacks had taken place. Those messages contained \u201cintelligence\u201d that Blumenthal passed on from a source he knew in Libya, and Clinton forwarded them on to State Department officials for further inquiry and vetting (Blumenthal\u2019s missives were often met with skepticism or thinly veiled derision).\n\nWhat does that have to do the attack that claimed the lives of four Americans? It\u2019s an excellent question, and reporters asked Gowdy specifically if he\u2019d learned anything new about the attacks from talking to Blumenthal. His response: \u201cI think all information you didn\u2019t know previously is new.\u201d Well, no one can argue with that bit of lawyerly weasel-speak. Asked again if he\u2019d learned anything new about the attacks from speaking to Blumenthal, Gowdy shrugged his shoulders and said \u201cwe\u2019ll let the transcript speak for itself, when and if it\u2019s released.\u201d Democrats on the committee are demanding that the transcript be released, but Gowdy won\u2019t say whether that will happen.\n\nGowdy\u2019s interest in Blumenthal doesn\u2019t have anything to do with his knowledge of the Benghazi attacks \u2013 Blumenthal doesn\u2019t appear to have any. But Blumenthal is close to Hillary Clinton, and Gowdy is turning the committee into a taxpayer-funded opposition research outfit now that Clinton is in the 2016 race for the presidency. He\u2019s already said that the issue of Clinton\u2019s email correspondence is \u201cbroader than Libya and broader than Benghazi,\u201d and after the Blumenthal deposition he seemed more interested in making Clinton look bad than anything else:\n\nGowdy framed Clinton as irresponsible for welcoming and forwarding the Blumenthal memos since the government never vetted their author or the sources behind his information. \u201cYou have an intelligence apparatus at your disposal. We have a CIA. Why would you not rely on your own vetted, sourced intelligence agency?\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Trey Gowdy is barely even trying to hide the fact that his Benghazi investigation is actually about Hillary Clinton", "title": "The never-ending Benghazi farce: Trey Gowdy is running a taxpayer-funded opposition research outfit", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Trey Gowdy is barely even trying to hide the fact that his Benghazi investigation is actually about Hillary Clinton", "title": "The never-ending Benghazi farce: Trey Gowdy is running a taxpayer-funded opposition research outfit", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/06/18/the_never_ending_benghazi_farce_trey_gowdy_is_running_a_taxpayer_funded_opposition_research_outfit/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/03/trey_gowdy.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Trey Gowdy is barely even trying to hide the fact that his Benghazi investigation is actually about Hillary Clinton", "title": "The never-ending Benghazi farce: Trey Gowdy is running a taxpayer-funded opposition research outfit", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/03/trey_gowdy.jpg", "creator": "@SimonMaloy", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Simon Maloy", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, 2016 Elections, Benghazi, Benghazi attack, Benghazi conspiracy, congressional republicans, Conservatives, Hillary Clinton, trey gowdy", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477afa6914bd0286fe5b0b\"", "article_summary": "Topics: 2016 Elections, Benghazi, Benghazi attack, Benghazi conspiracy, congressional republicans, Conservatives, Hillary Clinton, trey gowdy, Politics NewsHouse Benghazi Committee chairman Trey Gowdy appears to have given up his investigation into Benghazi.\nGowdy\u2019s interest in Blumenthal doesn\u2019t have anything to do with his knowledge of the Benghazi attacks \u2013 Blumenthal doesn\u2019t appear to have any.\nBut Blumenthal is close to Hillary Clinton, and Gowdy is turning the committee into a taxpayer-funded opposition research outfit now that Clinton is in the 2016 race for the presidency.\nIt\u2019s an excellent question, and reporters asked Gowdy specifically if he\u2019d learned anything new about the attacks from talking to Blumenthal.\nI\u2019m trying to figure out what happened to four Americans in Benghazi.\u201d That\u2019s a noble statement of purpose, but it\u2019s completely unconnected to what Gowdy is actually doing."}
