REUTERS/Fred Prouser (UNITED STATES - Tags: POLITICS SOCIETY IMMIGRATION) - RTR39L7S\n\n4849885\n\nExpenditures for entitlement programs including Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security saw sizable upticks in the first three months of the 2016 fiscal year, according to a new report released by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) Friday.\n\nSocial Security benefits and Medicare both rose by five percent, with an increase of $11 billion and $6 billion respectively, while Medicaid rose by eight percent, or $7 billion.\n\nThe nonpartisan scorekeeper attributed the rise in Social Security to growth in the amount of beneficiaries, while Medicaid spending went up due to an increase in enrollees due to Obamacare.\n\nThe CBO said the increase to Medicare was partially because \u201cpayment made to prescription drug plans each fall to account for unanticipated spending increases in the preceding calendar year was larger in 2015 than in 2014.\u201d\n\nSince October \u2013 the start of the government\u2019s fiscal year, which runs through September \u2013 total expenditures are up $978 billion, or 7 percent, an increase of 62 billion from the same period in 2014.\n\n\u201cThat increase would have been smaller\u2014$36 billion, or 4 percent\u2014if not for the shift of certain payments from January to December in each of the past two years. (The amount shifted into December 2015 was abnormally large because it included nearly $26 billion in Social Security benefits that normally would have been paid on January 3.),\u201d the report reads.\n\nIn addition to entitlements, spending on the Department of Veteran affairs went up 10 percent, and the Commodity Credit Corporation in the Department of Agriculture was up 49 percent with a whopping $4 billion increase.\n\nReceipts also saw an increase in the first quarter, taking in $766 billion, a $26 billion raise from the previous year. Around $22 billion came from income taxes.\n\nThe receipts were not expenditures, the CBO said the country\u2019s deficit increased to an estimated $11 billion in December \u2013 a sharp increase from the $2 billion surplus seen in December 2014 .\n\nAccording to the analysis, if the payment dates had not shifted, the government would have had a surplus $13 billion higher than the 2014 amount.\n\nFollow Juliegrace Brufke on Twitter\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
