That means that the federal tax haul so far this fiscal year has equaled $16,451 for every person in the United States with a job.\n\nIn 2012, President Barack Obama struck a deal with Republicans in Congress to enact legislation that increased taxes. That included increasing the top income tax rate from 35 percent to 39.6 percent, increasing the top tax rate on dividends and capital gains from 15 percent to 20 percent, and phasing out personal exemptions and deductions starting at an annual income level of $250,000.\n\nAn additional 3.8 percent tax on dividends, interests, capital gains and royalties--that was embedded in the Obamacare law--also took effect in 2013.\n\nThe largest share of this year\u2019s record-setting October-through-June tax haul came from the individual income tax. That yielded the Treasury $1,167,500,000,000. Payroll taxes for \u201csocial insurance and retirement receipts\u201d took in another $771,048,000,000. The corporate income tax brought in $255,453,000,000.\n\nThe business and economic reporting of CNSNews.com is funded in part with a gift made in memory of Dr. Keith C.
