The State of Working North Carolina, an annual report assessing how workers in the state are faring, shows what many North Carolina workers already know: unemployment continues to plague the state and many workers \u2013 despite working full time \u2013 are just not getting by.\n\nNearly 1 in 4 workers in the state are in occupations that pay less than $22,811 \u2013 the 2011 poverty threshold for a family of four. Roughly half a million workers in North Carolina are supporting themselves, and often their families, on the minimum wage of $7.25 per hour.\n\nThe minimum wage has received some long-overdue attention as of late with increasing attention to growing income inequality and national proposals based on the premise that those who work full time should not be living in poverty. Pre-labor day protests all across the country, and in North Carolina, highlighted the extreme disparity between workers struggling to make ends meet with soaring corporate profits in one of the few industries growing in the state.\n\nHere in North Carolina, the minimum wage tracks the federal minimum wage and it\u2019s hard to argue that $7.25 per hour is a living wage. And the fact that the wage is not tied to inflation means that as the costs of food and energy go up, wages remain stagnant.\n\nMoreover, research shows that raising the minimum wage can be a tool for economic growth. Low-wage workers are more likely than any other income groups to spend earnings immediately on basic needs and services, which in turn increases consumer demand. The GDP impact of increasing the federal minimum wage to $9 per hour, for instance, would be close to $500 million in North Carolina.\n\nNorth Carolina workers need a raise. It\u2019s a well-known fact that rates of lower union membership result in lower wages, and unfortunately, North Carolina remains the state with the lowest union density in the country. Our state\u2019s workers have suffered over the last three decades as the manufacturing industry crumbled and the economy shifted toward lower-wage jobs in such sectors as the service industry. The \u201crecovery\u201d from the Great Recession has witnessed declining wages. In the wake of Labor Day, it\u2019s time to honor the hard work of North Carolinians by supporting the policies that support working families.", "article_metadata": {"fb": {"pages": 71966175060}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://pulse.ncpolicywatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/cropped-logo_shadow-square-270x270.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0ef2\"", "article_summary": "The State of Working North Carolina, an annual report assessing how workers in the state are faring, shows what many North Carolina workers already know: unemployment continues to plague the state and many workers \u2013 despite working full time \u2013 are just not getting by.\nHere in North Carolina, the minimum wage tracks the federal minimum wage and it\u2019s hard to argue that $7.25 per hour is a living wage.\nNorth Carolina workers need a raise.\nIn the wake of Labor Day, it\u2019s time to honor the hard work of North Carolinians by supporting the policies that support working families.\nMoreover, research shows that raising the minimum wage can be a tool for economic growth."}
