Ryan Greysen, from the University of California, San Francisco.\n\nThe Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), which oversees those two U.S. government-run health insurance programs, wants doctors to go digital.\n\nCMS runs a $30 million incentive program that pays individual doctors to use electronic medical records (EMRs) \u2013 also known as EHRs for electronic health records. The agency will also begin penalizing doctors who don't adopt EMRs by 2015.\n\nGreysen and his colleagues point out in their report in JAMA Internal Medicine that part of the program requires that patients be able to access their own medical information through online portals.\n\n\u201cWhat I think has gotten lost in this is yes, we need the electronic medical records to be accessible, but who are the groups that will have difficulty getting to those portals?\u201d Greysen said.\n\nFor the new study, he and his colleagues analyzed responses from a national survey of about 19,000 Americans who were at least 65 years old and did not live in nursing homes.\n\nOverall, the proportion of respondents who reported using the Internet in any way doubled from 21 percent in 2002 to 42 percent in 2010. But that increase varied depending on the characteristics and health of some groups.\n\nThose who started with very low rates of Internet use saw some of the sharpest increases. For example, among non-white seniors, rates of Internet use rose from 7 percent to 21 percent.\n\nAfter adjusting the numbers for factors that are known to influence Internet access - such as sex, race, education and wealth, the researchers found only those who were 75 years old and older, not white or considered themselves to be in poor or fair health significantly increased their Internet use over the study period.\n\nThose with functional impairments ended the study period more or less where the larger group began, however. Just 10 percent of people with a functional impairment used the Internet in 2002 and that rose to 23 percent in 2010.\n\nIf people with functional impairments don\u2019t start increasing their use of the Internet, Greysen and his colleagues suggest, they may be left behind as the management of healthcare becomes digital.\n\nTo address this gap, the authors suggest strategies to help those with functional limitations to access the Internet. For example, people can use special software on their computers to have the text of a website read to them or to operate a computer with voice commands instead of a mouse and keyboard.\n\nGreysen added that his team is currently trying to teach older patients how to access their own information through the portals.\n\n\u201cWe show them how the patient portal works and how to navigate it,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cFor those who have more severe functional impairment, showing them isn\u2019t going to be enough,\u201d Greysen said. But teaching younger, unimpaired caregivers about the portals may be another possibility for expanding access.", "article_metadata": {"classification": "/FOX NEWS/HEALTH/GERIATRIC HEALTH",
