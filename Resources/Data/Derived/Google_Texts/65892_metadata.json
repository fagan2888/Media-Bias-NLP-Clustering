Absolutely nobody is looking out for the interests of consumers, landowners, residents and ordinary citizens.\n\nRosenquist, a consultant who owns a hobby farm with her husband, Bob, is as knowledgeable as any high priced energy attorney but she volunteers her time.\n\nIn 2010, she opposed billionaire T. Boone Pickens\u2019 Texas-size industrial wind turbine proposal for southeastern Minnesota farm country with a billboard \u2014\u201cPickens Gets the Gold Mine, We get the Shaft.\u201d Pickens pulled out and the $180 million project is now dead in her back yard.\n\nGoogle \u201cRosenquist\u201d today, and 425,000 mentions pop up, give or take. This past year alone, Rosenquist advised wind development opponents in her home state as well as Alabama, Iowa, Maryland, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin.\n\n\u2013Tom Steward, Watchdog.org Minnesota Bureau\u2013\n\n#10 Jonathan Gruber\n\nWhat? Jonathan Gruber, the best person of the year?\n\nSurely not the MIT economist and Obamacare architect who called American voters stupid and admitted a lack of transparency was necessary to get Obamacare passed.\n\nWell, yes, he is.\n\nPublic officials are not supposed to say the things Gruber did in a series of videos that came to light during the second half of the year. No matter what they might think, they are supposed to stick to the talking points, assure everything is being done in the best interest of the country, the poor, the oppressed and let\u2019s not forget, the children.\n\nGruber\u2019s greatest accomplishment is not helping write one of the most complicated, unpopular pieces of legislation in the nation\u2019s history. Or that he collected six-figure consulting fees from several states while duping them with his projections.\n\nIt\u2019s that he told everyone, proudly and honestly, how big things actually get done in Washington.\n\nEven if he didn\u2019t mean to.\n\n\u2013Eric Boehm, Watchdog.org Washington Bureau\u2013\n\n#11 Wayne Stenehjem\n\n\u201cWhenever the people are well informed, they can be trusted with their own government; that whenever things get so far wrong as to attract their notice, they may be relied on to set them to rights.\u201d\n\nThomas Jefferson wrote that in 1789, and it holds true today. North Dakota Attorney General Wayne Stenehjem is one of Jefferson\u2019s modern day defenders.\n\nStenehjem\u2019s office has worked hard to enforce North Dakota\u2019s very strong open records laws that apply broadly to all aspects of government. Good laws only work when we have public officials like Stenehjem willing to enforce them.\n\nHe has helped keep open records process accessible to the general public, and has been unwilling to accept technicalities or excuses from public officials for not following those laws. In doing so, he has set a strong precedent for enforcing the state\u2019s transparency laws for future leaders.\n\nNorth Dakota is a more open state, with better governance, because of Stenehjem\u2019s work.\n\n\u2013Rob Port, Watchdog.org, North Dakota Bureau\u2013\n\n#12 John Adams\n\nState Rep. John Adams was one of few elected Republicans who dared question Gov. John Kasich. And now because of term limits he is out.\n\nAdams is one of the limited-government legislators who thought Kasich\u2019s 2010 election heralded a sea change in Ohio. The governor\u2019s proposed\n\ntax hike on drilling for gas and oil, increased state spending and the expansion of Medicaid under Obamacare disabused them of the notion.\n\nAs assistant majority floor leader in the House, Adams fought to block Obamacare expansion in the Legislature and gathered signatures for a formal protest when Kasich expanded Medicaid unilaterally.\n\nHe and other conservatives worked for meaningful labor law, defined-benefit pensions and municipal tax structure reform.\n\nWith Kasich loyalists running the Ohio Republican Party and Kasich happy to lean on his bully pulpit, Adams\u2019 contrarian leadership will be missed.\n\n\u2013Jason Hart, Ohio Watchdog\u2013\n\n#13 Scott Wagner\n\nWhen he first got to Harrisburg, newly elected State Sen. Scott Wagner couldn\u2019t help but notice a few of the portraits of former state lawmakers hanging in the hallway of the Pennsylvania Capitol.\n\nAlongside portraits of lawmakers who served with honor were four who had been convicted of crimes. Nobody seemed to care much about it until Wagner, R-York, introduced a resolution condemning the practice of hanging portraits of dishonored lawmakers.\n\nThe portraits didn\u2019t come down, but not long after plaques were affixed to those four portraits chronicling their misdeeds.\n\nSince then, Wagner has helped spur the ouster of the Senate majority leader, challenged public-sector unions, pushed for public pension reform and urged lawmakers to re-evaluate everything, including the Capitol\u2019s electric bill.\n\nWagner\u2019s penchant for speaking bluntly \u2014 he compared union leaders to power-hungry dictators like Hitler \u2014 has been criticized. The criticism is unlikely to silence him.\n\n\u2013Andrew Staub, PA Independent \u2014\n\n#14 Bloggers in the Heitman case\n\nKristy Herron, Susie Taylor and Andrew Howe used their blogs to raise questions establishment media didn\u2019t about the death of an Oak Ridge School District employee.\n\nTraditional media initially didn\u2019t do much investigating in the case. Just last month, the same coroner who ruled that Alex Heitman committed suicide in 2011 recently lost his job due to allegedly tampering with a dead body.\n\nHeitman\u2019s family said that before his death he had discovered taxpayer money had been used to buy methamphetamine.\n\nThe three bloggers, none of whom knew Heitman, and none of whom are journalists by training, refused to accept the suicide ruling blindly. There was no coroner\u2019s report, they wrote, and law enforcement has been far less than transparent in providing information.\n\nA growing number of people in Oak Ridge now believe Heitman didn\u2019t take his own life and two area newspapers eventually had to re-examine the case.\n\nHerron, Taylor and Howe say traditional media avoid bringing negative attention to their communities. Blogging, they contend, is necessary for communities to stay informed and offers the opportunity for candid discussion of community problems.\n\n\u2013Chris Butler, Tennessee Watchdog.org\u2013\n\n#15 The Confidential Source\n\nOne of our best people for 2014 is the Confidential Source.\n\nThat means Watchdog really can\u2019t name this best person of the year. It\u2019s confidential \u2014 and we\u2019ve agreed to keep the identities secret. But you know who you are.\n\nYou make many of our investigative reports possible. We appreciate your tips, information, observations, complaints and concerns. Sometimes\n\nyour emails and calls turn into great stories, sometimes not. Yet they are always deeply appreciated.\n\nAlong with gratitude and praise, here are a few tips of our own:\n\nWe like records and hard evidence. The more, the merrier. Since we can\u2019t name you as a source, we must find other ways to prove the story is true.\n\nThere are conspiracies in the world, but we\u2019re not part of them. When we tell you that your identity will be kept confidential, you can trust us. Our professional reputation is at stake.\n\nSome of you prefer to be anonymous as well as confidential. However, there are times we really need to ask you questions about the information you\u2019ve sent our way. Sometimes we must drop otherwise promising stories because we can\u2019t verify details.\n\nThanks again \u2014 and we look forward to hearing from you again in 2015.\n\n\u2013Mark Lagerkvist, New Jersey Watchdog\u2013\n\n#16 Greendale Village Board of Trustees\n\nThe Greendale (Wis.) Village Board of Trustees stood up to its own parents and its Board of Education in 2014.\n\nThe Greendale Board of Education had asked that polling places be removed from schools after parents, reacting to the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shootings in Newtown, Conn., argued they increased the risk of gun violence.\n\nSandy Hook parents themselves had never asked for voting to be moved somewhere else after the deaths of 26 people.\n\nConcerned about voter disenfranchisement and added costs, village board members asked that taxpaying residents weigh in on a nonbinding referendum on the November ballot. Advocates, worried taxpayers without children would tip the scales in the other direction, asked the board to quash the referendum.\n\nThe village board refused until the school board agreed to withdraw its request to remove the polling places.\n\n\u2013Adam Tobias, Wisconsin Reporter\u2013\n\n#17 Brandon Presley\n\nWith the shifting gusts of public and political opinion, politicians generally spin like a weather vane.\n\nBut despite headwinds from two governors and the Secretary of Energy, Brandon Presley, commissioner for the Public Service Commission\u2019s Northern District, has remained steady and straight.\n\nPresley is one of the few elected officials in the state to decry the oft-delayed \u201cclean coal\u201d Kemper Project power plant. When the other two members of his commission voted to allow Mississippi Power to continue work on the plant, he was Dr. No.\n\nA plant that was supposed to cost $2.8 billion now has a price tag of $6.1 billion and counting, making it one of the most expensive power plants per kilowatt hour in U.S. history. Construction, already a year behind schedule, has cost Mississippi Power ratepayers millions of dollars in increased power rates.\n\nPresley, a Democrat and the former mayor of Nettleton, has gotten PSC opinion to blow in his direction. Earlier this year, the PSC told Mississippi Power until the plant is proven to be in commercial operation it will not hold hearings to decide whether Mississippi Power or ratepayers will pay for building Kemper.\n\nPresley didn\u2019t waver from his convictions and that\u2019s laudable.\n\n\u2013Steve Wilson, Mississippi Watchdog\u2013", "article_metadata": {"description": "Part 3 of our series on the goody guys of 2014, whose work whittled government and saved us tax money.", "og": {"site_name": "Watchdog.org", "description": "Part 3 of our series on the goody guys of 2014, whose work whittled government and saved us tax money.", "title": "COUNTDOWN!
