Steckel and Garrett Senney at the Ohio State University links that increase to the higher rates of heart-disease deaths.\n\nTheir findings are based off the idea that health conditions are transferred intergenerationally in utero via the placenta. This transference via pregnancy actually reverberates over successive generations.\n\nNow that may seem like it has nothing to do with the wealth increase, but over time the average Southerner had developed health traits based on the relatively poorer, more agrarian lifestyle of the region.\n\nIn the post-World War II change, the wealth that flowed into the Southern states seriously shifted the economic and cultural landscape of the region. This changed diets and, well, here's Steckel and Senney:\n\n\"While it is unsurprising that transitioning from a good to a poor nutritional state has negative health consequences, recent literature identifies negative effects that follow a transition from a poor to a good nutritional state. Research suggests that individuals with organs (e.g., kidneys and liver) optimized in utero for survival in lean conditions are more likely to suffer from [cardiovascular disease] if they consume a rich diet later in life.\"\n\nThese risks were especially true for those that were born just before or during this socioeconomic shift, which the researchers say started around from 1950.\n\n\"This suggests that the penalties of unbalanced physical growth increase when the developing body has less ability to adapt to a new environment,\" they wrote in the study. \"Individuals aged 75-84 in 2010 were born from 1926-1935 and were young adults with fixed biological structures, when dramatic social and economic change transformed the South after 1950.\"\n\nThere are a number of factors that contributed to the changes \u2014 increased purchases of food, more sedentary jobs, increase in the number of mothers working outside of the home, and more. These changes plus genetics from mothers added up to worse heart disease for years.\n\nThe researchers do show, however, that this could also offer a positive new prevention step.\n\n\"Heart attacks and strokes often appear after cardiovascular disease is well advanced, but this problem could be lessened by knowledge of proclivity based on socioeconomic information that many patients could readily provide, such as occupations of the parents and grandparents and their counties of birth and residence in adolescence,\" they wrote.\n\nThe idea being, if those Southerners had farmers or laborers for grandparents, it would behoove them to adjust to a healthier diet early, as their risks are higher.\n\nThe researchers also acknowledged inherent cultural factors that could contribute. But it's just as much genetics as it is biscuits contributing to the high rates of heart-disease deaths in the South.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#185f7c", "sailthru.author": "Bob Bryan", "application-name": "Business Insider", "twitter": {"description": "It's not just the Southern diet that is raising the rates of heart disease.", "creator": "RobertBryan4", "url": "http://www.businessinsider.com/why-southerners-die-of-heart-disease-2015-12", "image": "http://static1.businessinsider.com/image/568433c8e6183e8a0f8b5dc0-506-253/theres-an-economic-explanation-for-why-so-many-more-southerners-die-of-heart-disease.jpg", "title": "There's an economic explanation for why so many more Southerners die of heart disease", "site": "themoneygame", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.verticals": "moneygame,clusterstock,science", "linkedin": {"owner": "mid:1d5f7b"}, "sailthru.tags": "NBER, Heart disease, The South, Heart Attack, Bob Bryan", "description": "It's not just the Southern diet that is raising the rates of heart disease.", "author": "Bob Bryan", "sailthru.date": "2016-01-03", "sailthru.title": "There's an economic explanation for why so many more Southerners die of heart disease", "theme-color": "#185f7c", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://static2.businessinsider.com/image/568433abe6183e591e8b5c37-50-50/theres-an-economic-explanation-for-why-so-many-more-southerners-die-of-heart-disease.jpg", "news_keywords": "NBER, Heart disease, The South, Heart Attack, Bob Bryan", "tbi-image": "http://static6.businessinsider.com/image/568433abe6183e591e8b5c37/theres-an-economic-explanation-for-why-so-many-more-southerners-die-of-heart-disease.jpg", "fb": {"app_id": 155043519637}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://static1.businessinsider.com/assets/images/us/favicons/mstile-144x144.png?v=BI-US-2016-03-31", "date": "2016-01-03", "article": {"publisher": "businessinsider", "author": "http://www.businessinsider.com/author/bob-bryan"}, "sailthru.description": "It's not just the Southern diet that is raising the rates of heart disease.", "viewport": "width=1024", "og": {"site_name": "Business Insider", "description": "It's not just the Southern diet that is raising the rates of heart disease.", "title": "There's an economic explanation for why so many more Southerners die of heart disease", "url": "http://www.businessinsider.com/why-southerners-die-of-heart-disease-2015-12", "image": "http://static2.businessinsider.com/image/568433c8e6183e8a0f8b5dc0-1190-625/theres-an-economic-explanation-for-why-so-many-more-southerners-die-of-heart-disease.jpg", "type": "article"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Business Insider", "title": "There's an economic explanation for why so many more Southerners die of heart disease", "sailthru.image.full": "http://static6.businessinsider.com/image/568433abe6183e591e8b5c37/theres-an-economic-explanation-for-why-so-many-more-southerners-die-of-heart-disease.jpg", "tbi-vertical": "moneygame"}, "article_summary": "Southerners struggle with heart disease at a much higher rate than the rest of the US, and according to new research it may have a lot to do with their wealth.\nThese changes plus genetics from mothers added up to worse heart disease for years.\nTheir findings are based off the idea that health conditions are transferred intergenerationally in utero via the placenta.\nBut it's just as much genetics as it is biscuits contributing to the high rates of heart-disease deaths in the South.\nThe idea being, if those Southerners had farmers or laborers for grandparents, it would behoove them to adjust to a healthier diet early, as their risks are higher."}
