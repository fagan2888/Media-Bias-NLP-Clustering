Notice the, ahem, progressive meltdown, as he begins with criticism of the Koch brothers\u2019 involvement in the national health care debate and ends with blaming the Koch brothers for climate change and Russia\u2019s illegal seizure of Ukrainian territory. He is unable to respond to Republican action on any issue, even the investigation of the Obama administration\u2019s response to a foreign policy disaster, without invoking the Koch brothers.\n\nMake what you will of the Republican-backed House Select Committee on Benghazi: \u201cRepublicans care more about defending billionaires like the Koch brothers\u201d were the opening words to Reid\u2019s response to news of its formation.\n\nBitter, bitter man.\n\nNews outlets have produced supercuts in recent days depicting Reid as grumpy, ageist and racist, in light of his Asian jokes in front of a group of Asians that he later admitted were \u201cin extremely poor taste.\u201d The Washington Post\u2019s Aaron Blake reminded everyone that Reid \u201cdoes stuff like this a lot.\u201d The \u201cstuff\u201d to which he refers is misconduct of the tongue, which says nothing of the misconduct of his office.\n\nLife, indeed, is tough.\n\nBut Red Alert Politics has dug into the archives to demonstrate that it wasn\u2019t always like this. In 1986, Reid, then a member of the House of Representatives, gave an interview to C-SPAN in which he discussed \u2014 effusively! \u2014 then-Sen. Paul Laxalt (R-Nevada), a close friend of President Reagan; issues affecting the state of Nevada; and his own political career.\n\nStills of the footage reveal that Reid was, amazingly, thrilled:\n\nSimply thrilled!\n\nTo be there.\n\nDuring this 85-minute interview, Reid lamented that Democrats and Republicans sometimes have to run against each other (\u201cWhat a shame it is there has to be elections,\u201d he said he told Laxalt, a Republican, during a conversation between the two), praised the public-service virtue of representing the constituents back home, and just downright had fun.\n\nThis video reveals a different side of Reid that modern America has rarely, if ever, seen, a once happy warrior who smiled amid the discussion of politics and local issues and spoke with respect and praise of Republicans.\n\nReid, of course, went on to be elected senator, and eventually became an expert at grousing and abusing the power of his office.\n\nSee a glimpse of what life looked like before, in those halcyon days:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "NGFB Pro 7.8.4U", "og": {"site_name": "Red Alert Politics", "description": "From appearances, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid derives little pleasure from his job, perhaps a deputy to the paragon of joylessness.
