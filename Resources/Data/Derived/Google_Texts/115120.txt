So much for the Battle of Cole Harbour II.

Avalanche rookie center Nathan MacKinnon, 18, didn’t get to play for the second time this season against his famous fellow product of the Cole Harbour Bel Ayr Minor Hockey Association in the Halifax, Nova Scotia regional municipality on Sunday night.

That’s because the Penguins scratched Sidney Crosby, who had played in all 78 of Pittsburgh’s previous games.

“It’s always fun to play against Sid,” said MacKinnon. “He’s been pretty busy the last couple of seasons. I’m not sure if it was rest or whatever, but obviously it would have been fun to play against him.”

MacKinnon had six shots on Marc-Andre Fleury, but didn’t get a point in Colorado’s 3-2 shootout loss.

Familiar faces. Pittsburgh’s assistant coaches included former Avalanche assistant and head coach Tony Granato and former Colorado assistant Jacques Martin.

Avs lineup. Winger Cody McLeod missed his second consecutive game for the Avalanche with an ankle injury, and defenseman Cory Sarich missed his third in a row with a back issue. With only 11 available forwards, Roy again went with a lineup that included seven defensemen, including Ryan Wilson.

Road ahead. The Avalanche, which finished 26-11-4 at home this season, isn’t practicing Monday before leaving for Edmonton. After the game against the Oilers on Tuesday, Colorado’s season-closing trip includes games at Vancouver on Thursday, San Jose on Friday and Anaheim on Sunday.
