Sterne Agee Group Inc. says that market makes Health Net \u201cripe for the picking,\u201d and analysts estimate the $3.4 billion company could get about $60 a share in a takeover, a 43 percent premium to last week\u2019s close.\n\nProfits are forecast to shrink or slow for many U.S. health-care providers next year, which may lead to mounting pressure to do deals. Large providers such as Aetna Inc. and Humana Inc. will probably look to California to find acquisitions, according to Leerink Partners LLC. While Health Net\u2019s stock rallied 42 percent this year, the Woodland Hills, California-based company would still be a bargain, as it trades at one of the lowest sales multiples of its peers, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\n\u201cThe biggest thing for Health Net is their California government exposure,\u201d said Joshua Schachter, senior portfolio manager and principal at Snow Capital Management LP, which owns shares of Health Net. Large, managed-care companies \u201cwould love these members,\u201d he said of Health Net\u2019s customer base.\n\nBrad Kieffer, a spokesman for Health Net, declined to comment.\n\nCalifornia Gold\n\nHealth Net provides coverage to 2.6 million people in California, Arizona and parts of the Northwest, and it has plans tailored to Latino communities in California. Chief Executive Officer Jay Gellert has said the company could be an attractive target for providers seeking a piece of the growth from President Barack Obama\u2019s Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, according to Leerink.\n\nAbout 1.4 million California residents signed up for coverage under the new health-care law as of March 31, almost three times the amount expected and more than any other state, according to enrollment updates from California\u2019s Department of Health Care Services. Health Net captured some of that burgeoning market because it\u2019s one of 12 companies involved in Covered California, the marketplace for health-care plans in the Golden State.\n\n\u201cThe California market is one of the most, if not the most, advanced with regards to implementation of the Affordable Care Act,\u201d Brian Wright, a New York-based Sterne Agee analyst, said in a phone interview. \u201cBecause of that, you\u2019ll probably see the shift from employer-sponsored insurance earlier than you will in other markets.\u201d\n\nWright said Health Net may be able to get $60 a share in a takeover. The stock closed at $41.90 last week.\n\nToday, Health Net climbed 1.8 percent to $42.64.\n\nGrowth Key\n\nNational health-care providers are seeking to tap into growth from the Affordable Care Act and that means looking toward medium-sized targets such as Health Net, said Ana Gupte, a New York-based analyst with Leerink Partners LLC.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re all positioning themselves to be in these high-growth markets and develop a very efficient cost structure, and usually acquisitions can get you there faster,\u201d Gupte said during a phone interview. In California, \u201cthere\u2019s a very large Medicaid population, the exchanges are popular.\u201d\n\nBuying In\n\nAetna and Cigna Corp., the third- and fourth-largest U.S. insurers, respectively, are both underexposed to Medicaid, the government-sponsored health plan for low-income families, according to Chris Rigg, a New York-based analyst with Susquehanna International Group LLP. That makes Health Net an attractive target for both companies because so many of its customers participate in the program, Rigg said.\n\nWhile 49 percent of Health Net\u2019s members are enrolled through Medi-Cal/Medicaid, only about 9 percent of Aetna\u2019s total members and less than 1 percent of Cigna\u2019s are enrolled through Medicaid, according to company filings.\n\nFor such national-plan providers, \u201cthe path of least resistance may be to buy your way in,\u201d Rigg said.\n\nProfit growth at Hartford, Connecticut-based Aetna and Bloomfield, Connecticut-based Cigna will slow in 2015, according to analysts\u2019 estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Health Net is scheduled to report second-quarter earnings results this week.\n\nHumana Sense\n\nHumana, based in Louisville, Kentucky, is an $18 billion health-care company with almost no presence in California, making it another ideal acquirer for Health Net, Gupte said. Because California restricts the number of providers it allows on its exchanges, the only way Humana could get access to the state is through an acquisition, she said.\n\n\u201cCalifornia\u2019s a tough state from a regulatory perspective,\u201d Gupte said during a phone interview. \u201cHumana at some point would want to enter California. They\u2019re not here in California, and it\u2019s not possible to do it organically.\u201d\n\nRepresentatives for Aetna and Humana declined to comment. A representative for Cigna didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.\n\nHealth Net plans to announce a cost-cutting initiative that will target its general and administrative expenses, which have ballooned in the last few years.\n\nSnow Capital\u2019s Schachter said he hopes the company opts to be bought out instead of trying to outsource its back-office operations -- an option Health Net has been considering.\n\n\u201cThe best thing to do would be to sell the company to a Humana or United or even an Aetna, someone that\u2019s looking to get more scale and more members in Health Net\u2019s markets,\u201d said Schachter, who\u2019s firm manages about $4 billion. \u201cThis stock would fit very nicely into someone else\u2019s portfolio, and they\u2019d be able to take out a lot of costs at the same time.\u201d\n\nAcquisition Deterrent\n\nA potential acquirer may balk at the idea of buying Health Net if it can\u2019t squeeze out cost synergies because they\u2019ve already been outsourced.\n\n\u201cIf they do this outsourcing deal, we\u2019ll have to see what that means for anybody who tries to acquire them,\u201d Gupte said. \u201cAre they locked into this deal? Is there a clause that gets them out of it?\u201d\n\nSchachter, who also estimates a $60 takeover price, said Health Net is still attractive to national plans now because the company has already reviewed where it could scale back, making such cuts easier to execute for potential acquirers.\n\nIf a national-plan provider can sign a deal before Health Net finalizes plans to outsource its back-office expenses, the planned savings would just become synergies, Susquehanna\u2019s Rigg said.\n\nWhether the company cuts costs on its own or chooses to pursue a sale, investors are anxious to see it make a move, Schachter said.\n\n\u201cReading between the lines, it could be a takeout or it could be a G&A outsource agreement,\u201d he said. \u201cEither would be a big development for the company\u2019s bottom line.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Jennifer Surane", "twitter": {"url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-08-04/health-net-appeal-grows-as-obamacare-takes-off-real-m-a", "description": "After adding $1 billion in market value this year, Health Net Inc. stands to gain even more for shareholders in a takeover.", "site": "@business", "card": "summary", "title": "Health Net Appeal Grows as Obamacare Takes Off: Real M&A"}, "parsely-author": "Jennifer Surane", "parsely-type": "post", "keywords": "Aetna Inc,Humana Inc,California,Health", "news_keywords": "Aetna Inc,Humana Inc,California,Health", "parsely-link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-08-04/health-net-appeal-grows-as-obamacare-takes-off-real-m-a", "parsely-title": "Health Net Appeal Grows as Obamacare Takes Off: Real M&A", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ff0000", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "parsely-pub-date": "2014-08-04T20:09:37.804Z", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "description": "After adding $1 billion in market value this year, Health Net Inc. stands to gain even more for shareholders in a takeover.", "parsely-tags": "Aetna Inc,Humana Inc,California,Health,Region: Global,Page: article", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://assets.bwbx.io/business/public/images/favicons/mstile-144x144-bbd2101292.png", "date": "2014-08-04T20:09:37.804Z", "parsely-section": "science-energy", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "og": {"url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-08-04/health-net-appeal-grows-as-obamacare-takes-off-real-m-a", "site_name": "Bloomberg.com", "type": "website", "description": "After adding $1 billion in market value this year, Health Net Inc. stands to gain even more for shareholders in a takeover.", "title": "Health Net Appeal Grows as Obamacare Takes Off: Real M&A"}, "fb": {"status": "After adding $1 billion in market value this year, Health Net Inc. stands to gain even more for shareholders in a takeover."}, "parsely-post-id": "N98F216JTSFT01", "format-detection": "telephone=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce20b\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThe biggest thing for Health Net is their California government exposure,\u201d said Joshua Schachter, senior portfolio manager and principal at Snow Capital Management LP, which owns shares of Health Net.\nAfter adding $1 billion in market value this year, Health Net Inc. stands to gain even more for shareholders in a takeover.\nHealth Net plans to announce a cost-cutting initiative that will target its general and administrative expenses, which have ballooned in the last few years.\nThat makes Health Net an attractive target for both companies because so many of its customers participate in the program, Rigg said.\nBrad Kieffer, a spokesman for Health Net, declined to comment."}
