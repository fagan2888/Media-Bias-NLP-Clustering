Not only is there literally nothing to suggest the ACA undermines job growth, but the more the law is implemented, the stronger the job market becomes . How do Republicans explain this? Put simply, they can\u2019t.\n\nBut even putting economic reality aside, there\u2019s the small matter of what business leaders themselves have to say on the subject. To be sure, much of Corporate America and its lobbyists are thrilled to have a Republican-controlled Congress, but if GOP leaders assume private-sector leaders are prepared to join an \u201canti-Obamacare\u201d crusade, Republicans are going to be disappointed\n\nWhile many of the more conservative Republicans elected on Tuesday made their opposition to the Affordable Care Act a touchstone of their campaigns, there is much less appetite on the part of business leaders for wholesale changes to the health care law. For one thing, many of the insurance exchanges are finally working well, and businesses have adapted to the new landscape. Even more important, added demand from the newly insured is likely to increase profits in sectors like hospitals, pharmaceuticals and medical devices. \u201cAnything regarding the Affordable Care Act is going to be a stretch,\u201d said John K. Lynch, regional chief investment officer for Wells Fargo Private Bank.\n\nThis was published the day after the election, before the U.S. Supreme Court announced it might gut the federal law by scrapping insurance subsidies to millions of Americans who enrolled through healthcare.gov.\n\nWhat\u2019s brewing, in other words, is a situation in which the private sector wants the ACA to continue, and big business\u2019 ostensibly allies \u2013 Republicans in Congress and perhaps even Republicans on the Supreme Court \u2013 want something altogether different.\n\nBrian Beutler, trying to stem the tide of panic in the wake of the Supreme Court\u2019s Friday announcement, noted this morning, \u201cChief Justice John Roberts himself is a business friendly justice. The Chamber of Commerce basically bats 1.000 with him. An adverse ruling would cause immense harm to powerful corporate interests like private insurance companies, hospitals, and other stakeholders, all of whom oppose the challenge.\u201d\n\nThe Kaiser Family Foundation\u2019s Larry Levitt told Greg Sargent last week that if the high-court majority guts the system over the perception of a drafting error, the insurance market might very well \u201ccollapse\u201d in the affected states. \u201cCongress couldn\u2019t possibly do nothing at that point,\u201d Leavitt said. \u201cThere would be tremendous pressure from the insurance industry, and the health care industry generally, to fix this.\u201d\n\nNow, my suspicion is that congressional Republicans may not care, even under these circumstances. Their irrational, blinding hatred for \u201cObamacare\u201d is so all-encompassing, it\u2019s more than possible that GOP lawmakers would tolerate mass disruptions and even private-sector losses, just so long as the American health care system was failing.\n\nIt probably helps explain why insurance companies\u2019 stock prices took a sharp dive on Friday afternoon \u2013 it\u2019s easy to imagine Republicans on the Supreme Court acting irresponsibly, and it\u2019s even easier to imagine Republicans in Congress shrugging in the face of systemic turmoil.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "description": "it's not just Republicans against Democrats.
