Multiple officials from across that effort seemed as confused by the Instagram survey when confronted with as regular users were when it popped up in their Instagram feeds.\n\nThe surveys are no longer being delivered to Instagram users according to Facebook.\n\nOne survey, which was delivered to a BuzzFeed News employee, asked if the user could recall seeing any sort of message from healthcare.gov on Facebook, the social network which owns Instagram.\n\nAnother Instagram user, Ryan Lee, posted to Twitter that he was served a quiz asking \u201cWhat\u2019s the last day to sign up for health insurance through the affordable care act.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"bf": {"buzzid": 3670627, "userid": 260121}, "description": "\"The survey was posted in error and it was pulled down as soon as it was discovered,\" a Facebook official tells BuzzFeed News...", "copyright": "Copyright 2016 BuzzFeed, Inc.
