Gen. Jeffrey N. Colt, commanding general, First Army Division West said in a statement Tuesday.\n\n\u201cThe accident is under investigation and the names of the deceased will be released after the families have been notified. I want to extend my deepest sympathies and prayers to the Families and friends of the Soldiers involved in yesterday's crash,\u201d he said.\n\nA board is being assembled to investigate the cause of the crash.\n\nU.S. Sen.

Gen. Charles B. Allen, the 4th Infantry Division's assistant commander.\n\nAn Army report determined that the crash resulted from the decision of the pilots to fly under visual flight rules in conditions that warranted the use of instruments.\n\nThe pilots took off in foggy conditions without filing an instrument flight plan, but then requested an instrument flight plan minutes before the crash.\n\nOn Jan. 12, 2009, a Texas National Guard Black Hawk crashed on the Texas A&M campus.\n\nLt. Zachary Cook, a member of the Texas A&M University class of 2008 who majored in mechanical engineering while in the ROTC program, died.\n\nCook was a member of the ROTC staff at Texas A&M.\n\nThe other four soldiers aboard the helicopter were seriously injured.\n\nThe helicopter crashed near the Corps of Cadets field on the school's College Station campus during ROTC Winter Field Training Exercises in which about 190 ROTC cadets were participating.\n\nIt was one of five that were being used to transport cadets to Camp Swift in Bastrop, the university said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Sgt. 1st Class Toby A.
