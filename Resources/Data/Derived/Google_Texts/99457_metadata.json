To be clear, the automobile isn\u2019t going anywhere \u2013 on form and function, it has no rival; and as an instrument and symbol of progress, no single device better combines cutting edge technology with human needs. Rather, the way (and speed) those two inputs conspire to bring about change is the subject of debate.\n\nThe world\u2019s best-selling carmaker, Toyota, believes the automobile as we know it \u2013 gasoline- and diesel-engine powered \u2013 will be largely obsolete by 2050. As such, the company \u2013 already the hybrid king \u2013 is embracing the future and embarkingon a large-scale greening strategy.\n\nRelated: This Innovation Can Recharge Electric Car Batteries in Minutes\n\nBy the end of the decade, Toyota plans to reduce carbon emissions from new vehicles by more than 22 percent compared to its 2010 average. By 2050, it hopes to cut emissions by as much as 90 percent. Toward that aim, Toyota expects to sell 1.5 million hybrid vehicles annually across the globe by year\u2019s end 2020 \u2013 or annual growth of about 3 percent. The company will abandon plug-in electric vehicles and instead pursue hydrogen fuel-cell technology. By 2020, Toyota plans to sell 30,000 fuel-cell vehicles per year. Its new Mirai, launched in December 2014, has sold roughly 350 units.\n\nWhile perhaps not as public \u2013 or as optimistic \u2013 other companies are positioning themselves for electric-heavy markets in the not too distant future.\n\nNissan looks to continue its success with battery-electric vehicles as it aims to increase sales to 10 percent of its global total around 2020. Battery-electric sales were 82,602, or just shy of 1 percent in 2014, but a new battery, which should double the range of its popular Leaf model, has the company thinking an electric turning point is on the horizon.\n\nGeneral Motors is also expected to improve the range of its electric fleet before the end of 2016 with the modestly priced Chevrolet Bolt. Moreover, the American automaker has partnered with Korean electronics firm LG Corp to expedite and enhance the development of electric motors and battery cells across its brands. By late 2021, GM expects the partnership to enable reduced energy intensity and industry leading battery cell costs of $100 per kilowatt-hour.\n\nRelated: Apple to Make an Electric Car by 2019:\n\nIn the wake of its emissions scandal, Volkswagen plans to cut investment spending by $1 billion as it refocuses its brand on high-range, plug-in hybrids and high-volume electric vehicles. Volvo is engineering a similar shift away from diesel.\n\nFor luxury buyers, BMW appears ready to continue its loose, but ambitious plan of electrification. By 2020, the automaker hopes to sell 100,000 electric vehicles per year, and, within the next decade or so, convert its entire fleet to electric drivetrains (not necessarily full electric).\n\nFor its part, Honda will follow its \u2018Green Path\u2019 \u2013 a more holistic approach to sustainable production and products.\n\nThese widespread movements suggest the alternative vehicle market will be quite competitive in the near future, but companies will be vying for a share of a pie they wish was bigger. The fact is, consumers have been slow to come around to hybrids, EVs, etc, and CAFE standards and tax incentives have failed to manufacture the desired growth.\n\nU.S. auto sales have rebounded since the Great Recession, but, adjusted for population, Americans are buying fewer cars these days \u2013 and the cars they\u2019re buying aren\u2019t electric, or even particularly efficient. After four years of steady year-on-year growth, sales of plug-in electrics in 2015 have failed to match or exceed last year\u2019s numbers (European sales look good though). Traditional, gasoline powered cars \u2013 midsize, small, and luxury \u2013 have also seen sales decline since 2014. Strong auto sales in 2015 have instead been buoyed by significant growth in light-duty truck sales, as well as SUV and cross-over sales.\n\nLow gas prices are the primary culprit for EV\u2019s short-term dip, but insufficient infrastructure, inadequate consumer perception, and simple inconvenience are the greatest inhibitors of the impending boom. As those are sorted \u2013 and they will be \u2013 gasoline will enjoy what may be its last hurrah.\n\nThis article originally appeared on OilPrice.com.
