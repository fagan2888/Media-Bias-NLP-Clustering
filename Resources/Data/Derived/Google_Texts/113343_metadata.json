It reflected responses from about 650 businesses employing 35,000 people.\n\nAbout 40 percent of those businesses reported growth of technology-based companies was significantly or moderately helping their businesses. And nearly 69 percent felt the economy is now recovering or even prospering, a jump of 5 percentage points from last year's survey.\n\nMore Information Tale of two counties Economic optimism about the future in the Capital Region seems linked to how much of the region's technology boom is present in the area. Tech-heavy Saratoga County is upbeat, while in Schenctady County, the outlook is dimmer.\n\nThat outlook for the impact of technology growth was particularly true for chambers in Southern Saratoga County (57 percent), Colonie (46.6 percent) Albany-Colonie (45.5 percent), Saratoga (42.1 percent) and Rensselear County (41 percent).\n\nThe perception of tech's financial impact dropped off for chamber businesses in Guilderland (31.2 percent) the Adirondacks (30.8 percent), Schenectady County (26.5 percent) and Columbia County (20 percent).\n\nAnd while the outlook for future prosperity in coming years clocked in at 57 percent in the two Saratoga-based and the Albany-Colonie chambers, it lagged at 40 percent in Schenectady County and 35 percent in the Adirondacks, which were more likely to expect stagnation or worse.\n\n\"In places like Saratoga County and Albany, there is a direct correlation between technology and growth,\" said Kevin McCoy, a director of Marvin and Co. \"The tech sector is somewhat centralized now, but it will start to expand and trickle out to different areas.\"\n\nUAlbany Business Dean Donald Siegel said while some areas around the Capital Region are \"more bullish than others,\" the survey shows overall business confidence continues to grow in the region.\n\n\"These are the most bullish results that I have seen since I arrived here six years ago,\" he said. \"It shows that the recession in the Capital Region is over.\"\n\nThe survey also showed that businesses are becoming less likely to cut wages and jobs as protection from the economic downturn that began in 2008, and more than 90 percent indicated they expected to expand or remain stable this year, the survey found.\n\nHealth care costs remain the primary issue, as they have for 17 of the last 19 years, Siegel said. In a new question for the survey, the region's businesses also expressed concerns over impacts from the federal Affordable Care Act, commonly called Obamacare and what Siegel called the \"unaffordable Affordable Care Act.\"\n\nAbout two-thirds of businesses said the new law has \"increased costs to either their businesses or employees.\" About one business in every seven reported it had changed insurance providers as a result.\n\nSiegel said the law will likely create jobs as companies hire people to help companies comply with its legal requirements. Some of those could be people like Rebecca Shost, a UAlbany senior from Clifton Park who assisted in the survey and is graduating with a degree with information technology management.\n\nShe is using survey data as part of her undergraduate research, and already has been hired by global financial consulting firm Ernst and Young in its information technology department.\n\nbnearing@timesunion.com \u2022 518-454-5094 \u2022 @Bnearing10", "article_metadata": {"SKYPE_TOOLBAR": "SKYPE_TOOLBAR_PARSER_COMPATIBLE", "description": "While businesses around the Capital Region and beyond are more upbeat about the economy, their optimism seems tied to the technology boom, which appears not to be raising all boats equally.
