Mary Landrieu kept both President Barack Obama and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid at arm\u2019s length in Louisiana\u2019s third Senate race debate while the race\u2019s main Republican candidate, U.S. Rep. Bill Cassidy, skipped the televised debate all together. The Senate race in Louisiana, a state that supported Mitt Romney in 2012 and where Obama is unpopular, is under close watch as Republicans seek to attain six Senate seats to retake the majority.\n\n\u201c[The president] is not what I set my thermometer to. I keep my eyes on the people of Louisiana. I\u2019m not going to blame anyone but myself if I lose,\u201d Landrieu said Monday in New Orleans.\n\nRepublican challenger and Senate hopeful Rob Maness criticized the incumbent senator for backing Obama\u2019s health care reform law and other policies. \u201cThe president\u2019s policies are on the ballot. That\u2019s almost a direct quote from him,\u201d Maness said.\n\nLandrieu, however, defended her vote on the law, arguing that the Affordable Care Act provides more people with access to health care. \u201cI am not backing up from the things that I have supported President Obama on,\u201d she said. Landrieu argued her voting record has benefited the people of Louisiana.\n\nAlthough Landrieu had previously said she would vote to re-elect Reid if Democrats maintain Senate control, she distanced herself slightly from the Senate majority leader during the debate and took a neutral stance. \u201cI am going to wait to see what the leadership looks like,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ll see. I think Harry Reid gets beat up more than he deserves. And I\u2019m not saying yes and I\u2019m not saying no.\u201d\n\nContinue Reading Below\n\nCassidy was absent , but noted he\u2019ll take part in Wednesday's debate, to be broadcast statewide. That didn\u2019t stop the other two contenders from taking swipes at the GOP favorite. Landrieu slammed Cassidy for voting against the Violence against Women Act and hurricane relief, and for supporting the government shutdown. Maness said the Republican Party\u2019s complete support for Cassidy is unfair to voters and has affected his performance in debates. Maness said Landrieu as the incumbent and Cassidy being endorsed by the Republican Party has unfairly pushed him out of the spotlight as a valid Republican candidate in the polls and debates.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m running against an incumbent and the other is being treated like an incumbent. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s what America is,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThat skews the picture.\u201d\n\nAccording to a poll released earlier this month, Cassidy is likely to head into a runoff with Landrieu. The runoff will likely come thanks to Maness, who is showing 6 percent support from the electorate. He will likely prevent Landrieu, who is at 36 percent, or Cassidy, who is at 32 percent, from winning the needed 50 percent majority to ensure election. The poll also found that 23 percent remain undecided, so both candidates have a week to make inroads with voters before Election Day, Nov. 4.\n\nDemocrats across the nation have kept a distance from Obama and his sinking approval ratings ahead of the midterm elections.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://s2.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/themes/us_ibtimes/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "landrieu, mary landrieu, senate, senate race, midterm election, midterm elections, louisiana senate race, harry reid, obama, gop senate controll, gop takes senate, republican, democrat, bill cassidy for senate,  rob maness for senate", "og": {"site_name": "International Business Times", "description": "\"I\u2019m not going to blame anyone but myself if I lose,\u201d Landrieu said.", "title": "2014 Midterm Elections: Mary Landrieu Keeps Obama, Reid At Arm's Length During Louisiana Senate Debate", "url": "http://www.ibtimes.com/2014-midterm-elections-mary-landrieu-keeps-obama-reid-arms-length-during-louisiana-senate-1714988", "image": "http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/2014/10/28/landrieu.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "\"I\u2019m not going to blame anyone but myself if I lose,\u201d Landrieu said.", "title": "2014 Midterm Elections: Mary Landrieu Keeps Obama, Reid At Arm's Length During Louisiana Senate Debate", "url": "http://www.ibtimes.com/2014-midterm-elections-mary-landrieu-keeps-obama-reid-arms-length-during-louisiana-senate-1714988", "image": {"src": "http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/2014/10/28/landrieu.jpg", "identifier": "http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/2014/10/28/landrieu.jpg"}, "site": "@IBTimes", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#000000", "fb": {"app_id": 263851690471857, "pages": 128026713884051}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/themes/us_ibtimes/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/IBTimes", "section": "World", "published_time": "2014-10-28T16:18:39-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-10-28T17:15:25-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "\"I\u2019m not going to blame anyone but myself if I lose,\u201d Landrieu said."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3894\"", "article_summary": "\u201cI am not backing up from the things that I have supported President Obama on,\u201d she said.\nDemocratic Sen.
