Sean Penn raised $6 million for his Haitian relief organization J/P HRO Saturday night at an event in Beverly Hills, CA pulling in funds from an A-list crowd that included former President Bill Clinton.

Clinton reportedly sat at a table with Penn and took “selfies” with excited guests, as they wined and dined to live music at the Montage Beverly Hills hotel. His celebrity host then honored the former president, who stayed the entire evening.

The fundraiser’s guests also included Penn’s girlfriend Charlize Theron, as well as Mila Kunis, Ashton Kutcher, Ben Stiller, and Coldplay’s Chris Martin.

“It’s essential support,” the former Jeff Spicoli actor told E! Online of the fundraiser’s goals to provide the much needed aid. “At a certain point when there’s a disaster or a conflict in an area, there are grant monies for organizations like ours but they dry up pretty quickly when you move into a development phase and so this particular night is essential to keep the work that we do going.”

Actress Reese Witherspoon, who was also in attendance, spoke of Penn’s dedication to his charitable work, saying, “I’ve been so in awe of the work Penn does in Haiti.” She finished, “He doesn’t just talk and just raise money. He actually gets down there and helps build schools, communities and hospitals.”

After the evening total hit $5.8 million, Penn reportedly informed the crowd he would not introduce the last music act until the crowd helped to donate a consummate amount of $6 million.

After patrons obliged him, he introduced the Red Hot Chili Peppers.
