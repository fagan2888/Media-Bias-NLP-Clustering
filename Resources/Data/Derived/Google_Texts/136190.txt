DETAILS:

New updates and guidance issued by the federal government will impact HR operations throughout 2016. Accounting for all of these updates can be challenging and having the right resources in place, starting with an understanding of each change, is key. In its upcoming webinars, Equifax Workforce Solutions offers attendees the opportunity to become familiar with updates to the Form I-9 internal audit process and the Affordable Care Act (ACA) Employer Mandate.

Understanding the New Federal Guidance on Internal I-9 Audits

During this session, Chad Whittenberg, senior director of Product Management at Equifax Workforce Solutions, will join Montserrat Miller, partner at Arnall Golden Gregory LLP, to provide background on recently issued federal guidance for employers planning to conduct an internal audit of Forms I-9 on file at their companies. Miller will share best practices for avoiding potential pitfalls during the audit while Whittenberg will discuss tools that both aid in automating the audit process and assist with identifying and prioritizing any issues that may need remediation. In addition, attendees will hear about proposed changes to the Form I-9 and the potential implications for employers.

The Affordable Care Act Employer Mandate in 2016: What's Next for Employers?

In this timely session hosted by Bloomberg BNA, Kristin Lewis, senior director of ACA Product Management for Equifax Workforce Solutions, and Tom Dowling, partner, Employee Benefits Group, Stinson Leonard Street, will provide an overview of the lessons employers learned during the first year since the ACA Employer Mandate went into effect. Lewis and Dowling will share insights that organizations can apply moving forward and shed light on what's to come. Having helped employers of all sizes with healthcare reform implementation and compliance, Lewis and Dowling will offer attendees a closer look at the impact of the ACA on organizations and help them identify how they can avoid compliance pitfalls and manage ACA requirements.
