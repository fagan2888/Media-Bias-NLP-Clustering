Of all these forms of uncompensated care, charity care is typically the smallest cost for hospitals.\n\nA 2015 Wyoming Legislative Service Office (LSO) survey of hospitals found that only 7 percent of Wyoming hospitals\u2019 uncompensated care costs were the result of charity care.\n\nWhy is charity care so much less of a burden for Wyoming\u2019s hospitals than underpayments from Medicare and Medicaid, two of the largest government spending programs in America? Because Medicare and Medicaid systematically pay less for care than private health insurance plans do.\n\nIn the same LSO survey, hospitals reported that patients with private insurance paid, on average, 73 percent of billed costs for the care they received, while Medicare paid an average of 64 percent and Medicaid paid an average of 49 percent.\n\nAn LSO review of hospital spending data found that just 8.1 percent of Wyoming hospitals\u2019 operating expenses resulted from charity care, unreimbursed Medicaid, and bad debt in 2013.\n\nWyoming Medical Center, a nonprofit located in Casper, in 2013 reported $11 million in charity care costs, $4.2 million in unreimbursed Medicaid costs, and $28.4 million in bad debt \u2014 essentially bills that go unpaid \u2014 but still finished the year with $11.5 million more in revenue than expenses.\n\nDespite the fact Medicaid underpays for the services hospitals provide, the Wyoming Hospital Association wants the state to implement the 2010 federal health law\u2019s optional Medicaid expansion and add an estimated 17,600 adults to the program.\n\nNo one from the hospital group responded to Watchdog\u2019s questions about how Obamacare\u2019s Medicaid expansion would affect members\u2019 uncompensated care costs.\n\nIn a 2013 Casper Star Tribune op-ed, former WHA president Dan Perdue encouraged the legislature to expand Medicaid to help hospitals weather \u201cthe dramatic growth in uncompensated care\u201d and Obamacare\u2019s cuts to federal charity care funding.\n\nThe scheduled Disproportionate Share Hospital program cuts have been delayed after furious lobbying at the national level by the hospital industry, but Obamacare advocates have successfully used the threat of DSH cuts to secure Medicaid expansion in other states.\n\nIn those states, the entire cost of exploding Obamacare expansion enrollment will be borne by federal taxpayers through the end of this year. Starting in 2017, states will have to pay 5 percent of Obamacare expansion\u2019s benefit costs, increasing to 10 percent by 2020.\n\nHospitals hope to reduce their charity care and bad debt costs by putting more people on Medicaid. But, in a game of medical whack-a-mole, expanding Medicaid will also increase unreimbursed Medicaid costs. And those unreinbursed costs will grow even more if states are forced to cut reimbursement rates to make ends meet after the federal subsidy is reduced.\n\nThat\u2019s a situation Wyoming should avoid, said Charles Katebi, a health care policy analyst at the free-market Wyoming Liberty Group.\n\n\u201cMedicaid actively contributes to the uncompensated care problem. The state department of health says as much,\u201d Katebi told Watchdog.org.\n\n\u201cIn Wyoming there are roughly 5,000 individuals currently purchasing health care through Obamacare\u2019s insurance subsidies that would be potentially eligible for Medicaid expansion,\u201d he added. \u201cIf Medicaid expands, they will lose their subsidies and have to go onto Medicaid for coverage.\u201d\n\nBefore Obamacare\u2019s federally subsidized health insurance plans were available to Americans with income at or above 100 percent of the poverty line, actuarial firm Milliman estimated the Obamacare expansion would bump 4,600 Wyoming residents from private insurance plans into Medicaid.\n\nState lawmakers approved a taxpayer-funded bailout to address hospitals\u2019 uncompensated care costs in 2015, but the Wyoming Hospital Association sees Obamacare expansion as a long-term solution.\n\n\u201cFrom a hospital perspective, we\u2019ve got to find something to stem the bleeding,\u201d WHA president Eric Boley told K2 Radio in an interview last month, after Republican legislators rejected GOP Gov. Matt Mead\u2019s latest attempt to expand Medicaid in Wyoming.\n\nKatebi said that\u2019s a bad gambit for hospitals.\n\n\u201cHospitals could see their uncompensated care numbers increase substantially if patients go from using private insurance that covers the cost of their care to Medicaid that pays them below cost,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Wyoming hospitals want the state to expand Medicaid to help with uncompensated care costs, but Medicaid is part of the problem.", "og": {"site_name": "Watchdog.org", "description": "Wyoming hospitals want the state to expand Medicaid to help with uncompensated care costs, but Medicaid is part of the problem.", "title": "Wyoming charity care concerns not easily fixed by Medicaid - Watchdog.org", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2015/08/shutterstock_155901602.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-03-02T07:28:37+00:00", "url": "http://watchdog.org/258190/wyoming-charity-care-concerns-not-easily-fixed-medicaid/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Watchdog.org", "description": "Wyoming hospitals want the state to expand Medicaid to help with uncompensated care costs, but Medicaid is part of the problem.", "title": "Wyoming charity care concerns not easily fixed by Medicaid - Watchdog.org", "image": {"src": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2015/08/shutterstock_155901602.jpg"}, "creator": "@jasonahart", "site": "@watchdogorg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noarchive", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Watchdogorg", "section": "Health Care", "tag": "Charles Katebi,Gov.
