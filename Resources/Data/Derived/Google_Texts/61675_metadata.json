A decision in favor of the plaintiffs could pave the way for certain corporations to deny thousands of employees the same kind of health coverage that employees in most other companies receive. In our view, this is straightforward sex discrimination as well as a violation of the First Amendment\u2019s Establishment Clause.\n\nOn Monday, I wrote that this would impact a lot of women. Sure enough, on Tuesday, the AP wrote that the court clarified its position \u2013 the ruling will apply broadly. Here it is, via Talking Points Memo, \u201cThe Supreme Court on Tuesday confirmed that its decision a day earlier extending religious rights to closely held corporations applies broadly to the contraceptive coverage requirement in the new health care law, not just the handful of methods the justices considered in their ruling.\u201d\n\nThe National Advocates for Pregnant Women noted in a statement sent to PoliticusUSA that the silver lining in the ruling is the suggestion of full government funding for contraception, \u201cIf there is a silver lining to Justice Alito\u2019s opinion, it is this suggested solution to the problem: full government funding for contraception. Putting aside the current political situation in Congress that makes such funding improbable, the decision does suggest the real solution demanded not by RFRA but by human rights: a system of universal health care that includes everyone and covers all women and all of their health care needs.\u201d\n\nOh, that\u2019s justice. Definitely. But until we have a Congress that will do a solid for the people, we still have the power of our wallets.\n\nCitizens will have to speak with their wallets and at the ballot box until we get a Congress that will do its job.", "article_metadata": {"description": "It's not just Hobby Lobby.
