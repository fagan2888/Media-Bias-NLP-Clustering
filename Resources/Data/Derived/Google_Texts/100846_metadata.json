The Moon typically turns a reddish-brown color.\n\nIn recent years, the dark night skies over the towns have come to be recognized by locals as a natural resource worth preserving. The towns of Westcliffe and Silver Cliff have come together to protect a shared natural resource \u2014 their dark night skies.In the first effort of its kind, the towns worked side by side to ensure preservation of dark nights for the benefit of future residents. As a result of their efforts, the towns have earned Colorado's first International Dark Sky Community designation from the International Dark-Sky Association.
