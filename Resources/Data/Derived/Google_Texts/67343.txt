Arlington Hts. car show revs up enthusiasts

hello

Car enthusiasts flocked to the 3rd annual Motoring at the Museum Car Show sponsored by the Arlington Heights Historical Museum on Sunday.

Almost 1,000 people were expected to see the more than 100 cars on display, including a 1931 Model A Ford Coupe, a 2013 Ford Mustang GT convertible and a 2003 Dodge Viper.

"It's pretty great," said Jen Schwent, program coordinator for the historical society. "The first year there were 40 cars. Last year we had 96. We are shooting for 150 cars this year.

"The car owners really love it because there isn't anything like it," she added. "There is stuff for the whole family to do."

Six awards were given out for People's Choice, Best in Show, Exceptional Engine, Wildest Wheels, Superior Interior and Premier Paint.

"I think there are a lot of nice cars. It's good to see how well they take care of them. I try to teach my sons to do the same thing with their toys," said Keaton Durham of Arlington Heights as he looked at cars with his sons, Coleton, 3, and Landon, 5.
