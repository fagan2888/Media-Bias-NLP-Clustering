He supported higher taxes in the past, and I think still does support higher taxes. The thing I think really disqualifies him from being considered as a conservative is that he supports the government use of eminent domain to take property from a small property owner and give it to big corporations like himself. I think that\u2019s inconsistent with any theory or notion of limited government.\u201d\n\nPaul added, \u201cI think there\u2019s a problem with him being the Republican standard bearer, if he were to be so, because he\u2019s been supporting Democrats most of his life. In fact, he\u2019s been a Democrat most of his life. So no, I don\u2019t think he\u2019s a true conservative. In many ways, I think it\u2019s an act.\u201d\n\nThe Kentucky Senator called Trump an \u201cinsider\u201d and said he doesn\u2019t agree with Trump\u2019s views.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s [Trump] the guy who buys influence with both parties,\u201d Paul said. \u201cHe\u2019s been a supporter and has tried to buy influence with the Clintons. He\u2019s been a supporter and bought influence with Harry Reid, Charlie Rangel, with a host of people really on the far left of the Democrat party\u2026 everything Donald Trump is about is what I ran against and what the Tea Party was opposed to.\u201d\n\nMore On This...
