Pacific Investment Management Co et al, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 15-03339. The California case is Pacific Investment Management Co et al v. American International Group Inc, California Superior Court, Orange County, No. 30-2015-00779738-CU-SL-CXC.\n\n(Reporting by Jonathan Stempel in New York; Editing by Cynthia Osterman)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "(Reuters) - A federal judge on Monday cleared the way for Pacific Investment Managemen", "title": "NY judge clears Pimco to pursue California lawsuit against AIG", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/04/18/NY-judge-clears-Pimco-pursue-California-lawsuit-against-AIG", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/pimco-wellsnotice_2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/04/18/NY-judge-clears-Pimco-pursue-California-lawsuit-against-AIG", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/pimco-wellsnotice_2.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "(Reuters) - A federal judge on Monday cleared the way for Pacific Investment Managemen", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "The California case is Pacific Investment Management Co et al v.
