So says a first-of-its-kind survey, which finds that over 80 percent of gamers say they plan to vote.\n\n\u201cOne hundred million gamers will vote next year. Gamers are engaged, informed and hold strong opinions on critical issues,\u201d insists Michael D. Gallagher, president of the Entertainment Software Association, the trade group which conducted the poll of 4,100 gamers.\n\nAlmost half of the gamer voters \u2014 48 percent \u2014 are conservatives, and 38 percent are liberals; by party breakdown, 38 percent said they are Republicans or tea partyers, 38 percent are Democrats, while 24 percent are independents.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re smart, concerned, and they vote,\u201d declared Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee.\n\n\u201cThe gamers I know may be too busy playing to get to the polls,\u201d points out a less-convinced observer.\n\nThe gamers also appear to have eclectic opinions: 61 percent said there should be a \u201cmore equitable distribution of wealth in the U.S.\u201d while another 40 percent said the military should be used \u201cas often as is needed to promote U.S. policies.\u201d The most important issue for gamers is the economy, followed by terrorism, unemployment and education.\n\nSEND BILL O\u2019REILLY TO A GOP DEBATE\n\nThe next Republican debate looms on Tuesday night, and at last a pollster has asked GOP voters whom they really want on the podium as moderator. Given a choice of seven primarily conservative or right-leaning broadcasters, a new Vox Populi survey reveals all: Fox News prime-time host Bill O\u2019Reilly was in first place with 25 percent of the vote, followed by Sean Hannity with 16 percent, talk radio veterans Rush Limbaugh (14 percent) and Mark Levin (11 percent), NBC \u201cToday\u201d host Matt Lauer (7 percent) and talk radio regulars Laura Ingraham (6 percent) and Hugh Hewitt (3 percent). Nineteen percent of the respondents were \u201cunsure\u201d who they want as moderator.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean they are uninterested, however. The poll also found that 88 percent of the respondents plan to watch the Tuesday debate, hosted by Fox Business Network and The Wall Street Journal from a theater in Milwaukee. Another 93 percent definitely plan to vote in the primaries or caucuses next year, while 62 percent said the last GOP debate hosted by CNBC was \u201cunfair.\u201d The survey of 768 likely Republican primary votes was conducted Nov. 5.\n\nPREDICTION: THE MEDIA CAN\u2019T HURT CARSON\n\nBen Carson\u2019s confrontation with a hostile media horde continues, as do record campaign contributions from those who continue to believe in the Republican hopeful.\n\n\u201cHovering over the feeding frenzy is the absurd media spectacle of mainstream reporters claiming they\u2019re merely \u2018doing their job\u2019 by diving into 50-year-old details of Ben Carson\u2019s childhood. The same reporters who were not just incurious about the details of Barack Obama\u2019s background in 2008 but actively hostile to those who asked reasonable questions about his relationship with admitted domestic terrorist Bill Ayers and his years of religious instruction from Jeremiah \u2018God Damn America\u2019 Wright,\u201d writes David French, an attorney and National Review writer.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, what are we left with? An admirable though imperfect man who rose from abject poverty to the pinnacle of one of the most challenging professions in the nation \u2014 all while never forgetting his roots, maintaining grace and humility even as he earned riches and honors. In fact, his life story \u2014 and his character \u2014 would make him one of the most inspiring Americans ever to occupy the Oval Office. But he\u2019s a direct threat not just to leftist narratives regarding race and class but also to the leftist stranglehold on the black vote. And for that reason alone he must be destroyed,\u201d Mr. French continues.\n\n\u201cIf recent history is any guide, the Left\u2019s attempt to strike down Carson will only make him stronger. The media can launch its attacks, but it cannot change the fundamental facts: Ben Carson is a good and decent man, an American hero.\u201d\n\nONE FOR THE CANADIAN WARRIORS\n\nThe war in Afghanistan has inspired another film. \u201cHyena Road\u201d is an independent feature project following Canadian troops \u2014 specifically, an intelligence officer, a sniper and a local who\u2019s pulled into the conflict to settle a personal score. The movie has attracted a lot of attention: Samuel Goldwyn Films has picked up the rights to the film, citing director Paul Grosse for capturing the uncertainties of war and \u201crealistically depicting the bravery of troops.\u201d\n\nAs for Mr. Grosse, he was \u201cstriving more for the heroic tone of \u2018Zero Dark Thirty\u2019 than the moral ambiguity of \u2018The Hurt Locker,\u2019\u201d according to an early review by The Hollywood Reporter. The movie will be released in 2016.\n\nPOLL DU JOUR\n\n\u2022 88 percent of Americans blame the high cost of health care on pharmaceutical companies; 89 percent of Republicans, 89 percent of Democrats and 88 percent of independents agree.\n\n\u2022 88 percent blame \u201cthe health system as a whole;\u201d 89 percent of Republicans, 88 percent of Democrats and 88 percent of independents agree.\n\n\u2022 87 percent blame insurance companies; 89 percent of Republicans, 89 percent of Democrats and 88 percent of independents agree.\n\n\u2022 79 percent blame hospitals; 81 percent of Republicans, 78 percent of Democrats and 80 percent of independents agree.\n\n\u2022 64 percent blame doctors; 63 percent of Republicans, 64 percent of Democrats and 64 percent of independents agree.\n\n\u2022 58 percent blame Obamacare; 90 percent of Republicans, 32 percent of Democrats and 58 percent of independents agree.\n\nSource: A Harris Poll of 2,072 U.S. adults conducted Oct. 14-16 and released Friday.\n\nMurmurs and asides to jharper@washingtontimes.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "Attention, political strategists: Video gamers are now a voting bloc, politically engaged, motivated and ready to show up at the polls in droves.
