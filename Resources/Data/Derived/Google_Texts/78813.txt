“We love to do this. It's a great time of year after a lot of the busy tourist seasons gone home. These events are really geared towards the local family that support us and live in this community and support us year round. A lot of kids come out, it's just a lot of fun and something we're able to do,” said Mike Kerrigan, Director of Marketing for Pier Park.
