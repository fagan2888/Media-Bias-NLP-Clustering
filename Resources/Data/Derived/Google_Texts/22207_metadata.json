The Affordable Care Act is an important part of the everyday lives of millions of Americans.\u201d\n\nThat 16.4 million represents the number of previously uninsured Americans who have obtained coverage under ObamaCare as of February 15, the end of the latest regular open enrollment period.\n\nThat sounds like a major improvement over the pre-ObamaCare state of affairs, but consider this: When the Affordable Care Act (ACA) was passed in 2010, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projected that by 2015, there would be a net increase of 26 million individuals with health insurance (15 million through Medicaid plus 13 million through the exchanges minus 2 million who either lost or didn\u2019t get health insurance because of the ACA). Thus, even if no one had lost coverage since 2010 \u2014 and we know millions have \u2014 ObamaCare would be performing well below expectations.\n\nThe CBO\u2019s latest projections, which do take into account those who have lost coverage, say the ACA will result in a net increase of just 17 million insured people as of this year (10 million through Medicaid plus 11 million through the exchanges minus 4 million who would otherwise have private insurance but don\u2019t). That comes to just 65 percent of the CBO\u2019s original estimate \u2014 a significant shortfall.\n\nNot all of this can be blamed on overly optimistic assumptions at the CBO. Who could have foreseen that the Supreme Court, while upholding the ACA\u2019s individual mandate, would declare its Medicaid expansion nonbinding, leading 23 states to opt out? There would surely be many more insured people had all states expanded the program. After all, even with the lack of state participation, \u201cthe bulk of Obamacare\u2019s net coverage gains are coming from dumping people into Medicaid (59 percent of the current projected net increase in 2015), not from getting people enrolled in private insurance (41 percent),\u201d according to the Weekly Standard. And that\u2019s with the government\u2019s subsidizing 86 percent of private-insurance enrollees, something that could change drastically if the Supreme Court decides the law means what it says, namely that subsidies are only available on state, not federal, exchanges.\n\nAnother major factor in the ACA\u2019s underwhelming performance is that people simply don\u2019t like the plans available on the exchanges and would rather pay the penalty for not having coverage than shell out the bucks for expensive coverage that doesn\u2019t meet their needs.\n\nMany people weren\u2019t aware of the penalty prior to this year\u2019s tax-filing season. According to the Wall Street Journal, a survey conducted by McKinsey & Company\u2019 s Center for U.S. Health System Reform just after the end of the 2015 enrollment period found that 41 percent of the uninsured didn\u2019t know about the penalty. But that same survey discovered that awareness of the penalty didn\u2019t make much difference: Just 12 percent of those same previously unaware uninsured said that being told of the penalty would induce them to enroll in coverage.\n\nWhy would so few buy insurance when they knew they were going to be fined for not having it? According to the survey, 57 percent of the uninsured said the penalty is less expensive for them than coverage. (Thirty-one percent said they didn\u2019t need health insurance anyway, while 26 percent said they\u2019d like to have it but prefer to pay the penalty because it\u2019s cheaper.)\n\nThis does not bode well for the Obama administration\u2019s special enrollment period lasting from March 15 to April 30. That period was meant to give people who\u2019d paid the individual-mandate penalty for 2014 but hadn\u2019t enrolled in coverage for 2015 another chance to enroll. The administration was hoping both to head off the public-relations nightmare of Americans\u2019 discovering they were subject to the penalty after the 2015 enrollment period had ended and to boost the 2015 enrollment numbers. Now it appears that few people are taking advantage of the opportunity.\n\n\u201cOur analysis indicates that a significant percentage of taxpayers whose household members were not covered for at least a portion of 2014 are opting\u201d not to buy coverage for 2015 and instead pay the penalty again, H&R Block vice president of healthcare enrollment Mark Ciaramitaro told the Journal.\n\nThe special enrollment period \u201cwas a good PR move and aligns enrollment with tax season, but we\u2019re not seeing a massive rush,\u201d Jackson Hewitt Tax Service spokesman Mark Steber told the paper. \u201cIt\u2019s been pretty unremarkable.\u201d\n\nThis is somewhat surprising given that the penalty is increasing significantly this year. For 2014, it was the higher of $95 or one percent of income. For 2015, it\u2019s the higher of $325 or two percent of income \u2014 \u201cthough,\u201d notes the Journal, \u201cmillions of people qualify for exemptions.\u201d\n\nOne person who\u2019s opting to pay the penalty is 59-year-old Navarre, Florida, resident Richard Gonzalez, a retired United Parcel Service employee. Gonzalez told the Journal it would cost him $400 a month for an exchange plan with a $6,000 deductible, while his penalty for not having coverage would be just $250.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s wrong I have to pay the penalty,\u201d said Gonzalez. \u201cBut it beats paying more than $10,000 a year.\u201d\n\nOf course, even those who do obtain exchange coverage may be in for a shock come tax time. Their subsidies are based on their estimated income at the time of enrollment. If their actual income varies from their estimate, they may see their tax refunds shrink or even owe money to the government. Furthermore, anyone who bought exchange coverage in 2014 and didn\u2019t choose a new plan for 2015 was automatically re-enrolled in the same plan, with his subsidy based on his 2014 income projection, making it even more likely to be wrong this year \u2014 a problem that will persist and quite possibly get worse as long as subsidies continue to be based on individuals\u2019 income estimates.\n\nThen there are the exchange plans\u2019 narrow provider networks, the websites\u2019 technical glitches, and the Obama administration\u2019s sending out hundreds of thousands of incorrect tax statements for 2014.\n\nAdd up all the negatives of ObamaCare, and it\u2019s no wonder it isn\u2019t living up to its backers\u2019, or even the CBO\u2019s, expectations. Worse still, even if ObamaCare meets the CBO\u2019s current expectations, it will still leave 31 million people uninsured \u2014 up to seven million more than it will insure \u2014 and taxpayers, whether they are insured or not, will pay a $2 trillion penalty.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "ObamaCare, fines, coverage, penalty", "og": {"url": "http://www.thenewamerican.com/usnews/health-care/item/20491-obamacare-insuring-fewer-than-expected-with-many-choosing-fines-over-coverage", "image": "http://www.thenewamerican.com/media/k2/items/cache/c8d959f6af7b702429e18b52a984d9bf_XL.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "ObamaCare enrollment is far below initial projections, in part because many people are finding that the penalty for not having coverage is cheaper than coverage.
