These hospitals should not be permitted to turn away patients seeking emergency medical care, to discriminate against women by refusing to provide critical reproductive health services, or to force their values on patients who may not share them,\" the report said.\n\nIt said the Ethical and Religious Directives for Catholic Health Care Services, promulgated by the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, prohibit health services including contraception, sterilisation, many infertility treatments, and abortion, even when a woman's life is in danger.\n\nThe report also noted that transgender and gender-non-conforming patients also suffer the same fate.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt said the belief that in emergency cases, Catholic hospitals will provide abortion services, does not happen.\n\nMedical ethics and federal law bar hospitals from denying emergency care. Under the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act (EMTALA), hospitals that receive Medicare funds and operate emergency departments are required to provide stabilising treatment to patients experiencing emergency medical condition.\n\nACLU, however, claimed that it has collected numerous stories of women being denied emergency care at Catholic hospitals.\n\nAs of March 2016, there are 548 hospitals in the U.S. that adhere to the Catholic directives, or 14.5 percent of all acute hospitals in the country.\n\nCatholic leaders criticised the ACLU for the report.\n\n\"The ACLU has long waged war on Catholics over the issue of abortion. Now it has joined with Planned Parenthood to author a report that sounds the alarms over the 'news' that one in six hospitals in the nation is Catholic-run,\" said Catholic League for Religious and Civil Rights' Bill Donohue.\n\nHuman Life International's Director of Research and Training Brian Clowes told LifeSite News that both the ACLU and MergerWatch \"have one objective in mind: To force Catholic hospitals to perform abortions and sterilisations as a blanket policy.\"", "article_metadata": {"description": "The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) is accusing Catholic hospitals in the U.S. of denying women of reproductive health care services due to religious beliefs.", "title": "ACLU launches new campaign against Catholic hospitals in bid to cut federal funding", "og": {"image": "http://d2.christiantoday.com/en/full/46978/nuns-at-us-supreme-court.jpg", "description": "The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) is accusing Catholic hospitals in the U.S. of denying women of reproductive health care services due to religious beliefs.", "title": "ACLU launches new campaign against Catholic hospitals in bid to cut federal funding"}, "HandheldFriendly": "True", "p": {"domain_verify": "035da258d4370c219fc1e27db5605a75"}, "MobileOptimized": 320, "Keywords": "christian news,christianity,evangelical,ACLU,Catholic hospitals,reproductive health care,Abortion", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "ACLU, however, claimed that it has collected numerous stories of women being denied emergency care at Catholic hospitals.\n\"Catholic hospitals also receive billions in taxpayer dollars.\nIt said the Ethical and Religious Directives for Catholic Health Care Services, promulgated by the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, prohibit health services including contraception, sterilisation, many infertility treatments, and abortion, even when a woman's life is in danger.\nReutersThe American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) is accusing Catholic hospitals in the U.S. of denying reproductive health care services to women due to the hospital administrators' religious beliefs.\nAdvertisementIt said the belief that in emergency cases, Catholic hospitals will provide abortion services, does not happen."}
