Eighty-six percent of states, including Texas, now authorize pharmacists to collaborate with physicians so the pharmacist can initiate, modify or continue medications for patients. This is called collaborative drug therapy management (CDTM) and works with written guidelines established between the physician and pharmacist,\" Jenkins said. \"A second current trend - an increase in medication use requiring more pharmacists - is associated with the aging population, the Affordable Care Act and the expansion of Medicaid in 26 states (not Texas). Seventy percent of Americans use at least one medication daily, and as the population gets older and more patients have insurance coverage for medicines, the demand for medications is expected to increase. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics projects the pharmacy field adding over 41,000 jobs by 2022.\"\n\nJenkins added that the pharmacist market is quite competitive. While almost all pharmacists are able to get a job right after graduation, she said, many are finding, that like most careers, it is beneficial to get additional qualifications to make themselves more marketable for their ideal job.\n\nA pharmacist also requires a broad range of knowledge and skills.\n\nCritical thinking and problem-solving are vital for a pharmacist to be able to identify, resolve and prevent drug-related problems.\n\n\"Other skills needed include communication, attention to detail, pharmacy-specific skills such as compounding or preparing IV products and computer proficiency,\" Jenkins said.\n\nIn Texas, a person also must graduate from an Accreditation Council for Pharmacy Education-accredited school of pharmacy and must pass the North American Pharmacist Licensure Examination (NAPLEX) and Multistate Pharmacy Jurisprudence Examination (MPJE).\n\n\"This is a good time to become a pharmacist because the demand for pharmacists' skills and knowledge in successfully managing medication use will continue to grow as the population ages and complex therapy is used for the management of diseases,\" Osemene said.\n\nU.S. News & World Report recently announced its best jobs of 2014, and pharmacists earned a spot in the top five.\n\nThe media source used data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics to identify jobs with the greatest hiring demand. Jobs were then scored using seven component measures, including 10-year growth volume, employment rate and future job prospects.", "article_metadata": {"SKYPE_TOOLBAR": "SKYPE_TOOLBAR_PARSER_COMPATIBLE", "description": "The role of the pharmacist has evolved rapidly in recent years, from that of a dispensary role to a fully integrated and essential component of the health care system involved in patient care.  \"Pharmacists' primary responsibility is to ensure the use of medications is according to the best scientific evidence, safe and effective,\" said Nora Osemene, professor and chair of the department of pharmacy practice at Texas Southern University's College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences.
