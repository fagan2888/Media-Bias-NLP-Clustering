and the police department, alleging that discrimination led to their arrest last year after they canvassed a white neighborhood to remind people about the March 31st deadline to sign up for Obamacare and to gather signatures for a petition for a progressive tax.\n\nKevin Tapia and Felipe Hernandez say that city police unjustly arrested them and detained them for three hours on charges of \u201csoliciting unlawful business,\u201d according to the Chicago Sun-Times.\n\nThe city dropped the charges against them two months later, but the young men say the record of their arrest very likely will haunt them when they try to further their education, and obtain employment, among other things.\n\n\u201cThey automatically convicted us on the spot,\u201d said Hernandez, according to the newspaper.\n\nThe Sun-Times said that the men said they showed police identification, and explained what they were doing, but were treated in a hostile manner anyway.\n\n\u201cI was shocked to be arrested,\u201d said Tapia to the Sun-Times. \u201cEspecially for engaging in a lawful activity\u2026This arrest was simply unfair, unjust and simply outrageous.\u201d\n\nA spokesman for the Chicago Police Department said it is its policy not to profile.\n\n\u201cThis matter stemmed from a 911 call made by a city resident, and there is no basis to suggest that this is indicative of anything other than that,\u201d said spokesman Marty Maloney, according to the Sun-Times.\n\nThe newspaper cited police as saying that the neighborhood where Tapia and Hernandez were going door-to-door had been the target of scams in the weeks before they approached residents with the tax petition and reminders about the Obamacare enrollment deadline.\n\nThe police also maintained to the newspaper that the men were unable to furnish adequate identification from Grassroots Collaborative, the organization for which they were going door-to-door.\n\nThe men and the organization disputed that.\n\n\u201cIt is the right and duty of citizens to talk to their neighbors about the issues they feel strongly about,\u201d said Amisha Patel, the executive director of Grassroots Collaborative, in the Sun-Times article.\n\nPatel said that the police treatment of Tapia and Hernandez sent a chilling message to minorities.\n\n\u201cAre they in danger of getting arrested for door-knocking and talking to their neighbors about the things that they care about?\u201d Patel asked. \u201cWe all deserve to live in a city where we can talk to anybody in any neighborhood, especially if they are young men of color who are working to make their communities better.\u201d\n\nFollow us on twitter.com/foxnewslatino\n\nLike us at facebook.com/foxnewslatino", "article_metadata": {"classification": "LANGUAGES/English",
