It was instead a confirmation of the shape of this chaotic contest.\n\nWe\u2019ll look at the leaderboard, but first a word about the debates themselves: There have been too few of them and with too many candidates on stage. How can voters decide in this cacophony? Despite solid questions and good moderating, the CNN debate was still painful because every time it seemed like a real discussion was going to break out, one of the candidates in electoral Siberia would start howling.\n\n\n\nThis has to stop. The stage needs to be shrunk not expanded, as CNN did in this case. If networks will not perform their due diligence and start focusing the discussion of viable candidates, then they will have failed in their responsibilities. Plus, it will only get more boring as candidates\u2019 answers become more canned. Enough already. Nine people are a baseball team, not a debate.\n\n\n\nKeep the undercard, or, heck, make it bigger if you like. Make them wrestle bears or spin plates. Whatever you want, but for the real thing, a New Year needs to be a new start.\n\n\n\nOn to the leaderboard\u2026\n\n\n\nDonald Trump had his best debate. He was engaged almost the whole time, traded rambling answers for concise talking points and mostly avoided bullying. There were certainly enough putdowns and wrestling-ring braggadocio for his fans to cheer, but this was something of another persona for Trump. While Trump\u2019s ideas for shutting down the Internet and a religious test for entry to the United States were broadly panned by his rivals, he just shrugged his way through.\n\n\n\nTed Cruz didn\u2019t have such a fine outing, but he probably did what he needed to do \u2013 even if it was costly in the short term. Cruz has correctly concluded that the Republican Party will unite to defeat Trump and prevent a general election slaughter, so he continues his truce with the frontrunner as he bides his time. Even so, when Trump treated Cruz like a caddy that lost track of a slicing five-iron shot, and Cruz deferred to the boss it was anguishing. But by subordinating his ego and keeping up his fight with other elected officials, Cruz kept the focus where he wants it: him versus the rest of the establishment.\n\n\n\nMarco Rubio is really good at this and only getting better. Those establishmentarians nurturing dreams of late-winter resurrections may want to go ahead and book their post-campaign vacations. Rubio was under sustained attack all night and seemed actually to enjoy the challenge. The rap on Rubio is that he\u2019s a lightweight, but he keeps giving heavyweight answers.\n\n\n\nBen Carson has been studying and it showed. He gave a couple of answers that demonstrated a broadening understanding of foreign policy. But as Rick Perry and many others can attest, second acts are hard to come by in politics. Cruz has co-opted his supporters in Iowa and shows no signs of letting up.\n\n\n\nJeb Bush made another try to call out Trump. And again, he left Trump stronger. Bush looks like he wants to crawl right out of his skin throughout each of these debates. And what is worst for him is that the very thing Bush purports to want to do \u2013 show up Trump \u2013 he actually prevents by being in the race. Bush is Trump\u2019s preferred punching bag and, along with Rand Paul and John Kasich, one of the only candidates little-enough liked for Trump to pummel with impunity.\n\n\n\nChris Christie is starting to seem like the John McCain in this race. No, not that one. The one from 2000, when he staged a New Hampshire rebellion as a maverick, straight talker against George W. Bush. Rubio, on the other hand, is starting to look a lot more like Dubya in that cycle. Christie certainly can\u2019t count out Carly Fiorina in that state or in that lane of the GOP. Fiorina turned in another creditable debate performance and is well gaited for the Granite State. But if Christie gets New Hampshire on his side, he could mean trouble for Rubio in locking up their half of the national party.\n\n\n\n[Chris Stirewalt and Howard Kurtz gave Megyn Kelly their initial reactions to Tuesday\u2019s debate on \u201cThe Kelly File.\u201d Watch here.]\n\n\n\nPower Play: It\u2019s been a long December\u2026 - History shows the frontrunner the year before the election rarely keeps that lead when voters actually take to the election booth. As 2015 comes to a fast close, Trump\u2019s lead looks indomitable, but it seems that\u2019s bad news for the mogul. Chris Stirewalt explains it all in just 60 seconds. WATCH HERE.\n\n\n\nCruz disclosed classified information? - Roll Call: \u201cDid Sen. Ted Cruz disclose classified information on national television? Those without access to the intelligence itself probably won\u2019t know for sure, but that seemed to be the implication from a reaction from presidential campaign rival and fellow Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., during a portion of Tuesday\u2019s CNN debate that focused on their differing views on the scope of National Security Agency surveillance programs\u2026[Rubio responded to the questioning saying] \u201cLet me be very careful when answering this, because I don\u2019t think national television in front of 15 million people is the place to discuss classified information\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\nTrump recommits to GOP - WashEx: \u201cWhen pressed by radio host Hugh Hewitt, Trump said that he is \u2018totally committed\u2019 to the GOP, adding that he has \u2018gained great respect\u2019 for those in the Republican leadership and his competitors for the nomination. \u2018I really am,\u2019 Trump said when asked if he'll stand by his pledge. \u2018I\u2019ll be honest, I really am.\u2019\u201d\n\n\n\nWITH YOUR SECOND CUP OF COFFEE\u2026\n\nSmithsonian: \u201cA prominent educator and patron of the arts, Henry Cole travelled in the elite, social circles of early Victorian England, and had the misfortune of having too many friends. During the holiday season of 1843, those friends were causing Cole much anxiety \u2026As [Cole] watched the stacks of unanswered correspondence he fretted over what to do\u2026 He approached an artist friend, J.C. Horsley, and asked him to design an\u2026illustration\u2014a triptych showing a family at table celebrating the holiday flanked by images of people helping the poor\u2014and had a thousand copies made by a London printer. The image was printed on a piece of stiff cardboard 5 1/8 x 3 1/4 inches in size. At the top of each was the salutation, \u2018TO:_____\u2019 allowing Cole to personalize his responses, which included the generic greeting \u2018A Merry Christmas and A Happy New Year To You.\u2019 It was the first Christmas card.\u201d\n\n\n\nGot a TIP from the RIGHT or the LEFT?

And it increases the federal deficit by hundreds of billions of dollars by extending numerous, popular tax credits without paying for them. House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., announced the deal in a closed-door, late-night meeting with GOP lawmakers and said it includes their proposal to lift a four-decade-old ban on exporting U.S. crude oil\u2026The final package also is expected to allow for the delay of three ObamaCare taxes -- the medical device tax, so-called \u201cCadillac tax\u201d and health insurance tax -- congressional sources told Fox News\u2026House Republicans said a vote on the package is expected by Thursday\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\nNo ObamaCare bailouts either - The Hill: \u201cThe government funding bill unveiled late Tuesday night includes a provision touted by Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) that would prevent what Republicans call a \u2018bailout\u2019 of health insurers under ObamaCare.\u201d\n\n\n\nHILLARY MEETS WITH MUSLIMS\n\nStar Tribune: \u201cHillary Clinton cited efforts already underway in Minnesota as an example of how to fight domestic recruitment of terrorists, using a Minneapolis speech on Tuesday to call for a stepped-up effort but one that respects people of different backgrounds\u2026At least 12 Somali-American men from Minnesota have been charged with attempting to go abroad to fight for the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant, or ISIL. Minnesota is part of a nationwide pilot project, a collaboration of federal and local law enforcement, Muslim religious leaders and youth groups trying to intervene with young people who might be vulnerable to recruitment. Clinton praised the program and said it should be better-funded.\u201d\n\n\n\nWhat journalists really need to ask Hillary - Michael Barone says the question journalists need to ask, about Benghazi, about her husband\u2019s questionable treatment of woman, and on issues in general is \u201cdo you really believe this?\u201d He outlines his reasoning here.\n\n\n\nLIKE SISYPHUS, BUT WITH TURKEYS\n\nWBZ: \u201cA Cape Cod postal worker has had some unwelcome company on his mail route. Video posted by the Cape Cod Wave earlier this month shows five gobbling turkeys harassing a Falmouth mail carrier. The mailman has armed himself with a pole to keep the birds at bay, and tells the camera that this sort of thing happens \u2018every day\u2019 \u2026Recently, The Cape Cod Times published a story about the exploding wild turkey population in the region. It says turkeys have been stopping traffic and even posing for photographs by amused residents.\u201d\n\n\n\nAND NOW A WORD FROM CHARLES\u2026\n\n\u201cIt does not matter what she says. As long as she gives the appearance of being interested and slightly animated\u2026that\u2019s all that matters. Nobody is listening to what she is saying on anything, least of all, on [counterterrorism].\u201d \u2013 Charles Krauthammer on \u201cSpecial Report with Bret Baier.\u201d\n\n\n\nChris Stirewalt is digital politics editor for Fox News.
