All other decisions as to what is good and bad, or right and wrong are made up of varying shades of grey, she says.\n\nThe philosophy professor at the University of Guelph led a workshop on Saturday morning as part of the Do So Much conference, hosted by the university. Speaking to around 30 people in a classroom in Rozanski Hall, she asked the group whether or not humans were capable of genuine, unselfish giving.\n\nAfter an hour of picking apart the true nature of giving and deconstructing the ideas of what makes up a selfish and unselfish action, there was still no answer to the question.\n\n\"It might be that giving or volunteering is not 100 per cent just good,\" she said to the room made up of mostly students. \"What I'm really asking you to do is let yourself be honest about some quandaries you might have around this thing called giving.\"\n\nThe act of donating blood may seem like a purely selfless act, but it may cause the person donating to feel a sense of pride for his or her actions, she said. This pride might then cause them to pass judgment on those who aren't able to donate, or those who choose not to.\n\nHoule said the problem with declaring an action to be altruistic and purely good, is there are too many unknowns that go along with that action.\n\n\"I'd like people to be able to honour the uncertainties that they have, and not be ashamed of them,\" she said in an interview after the workshop. It takes courage to stand by one's decision and defend it but \"there's this other kind of moral courage that admits one's in a grey area and doesn't have all the answers.\"\n\nHoule's lecture was the first of the conference, and was presented as part of the activism stream of workshops. The two other workshops held in different rooms at the same time focused on innovative communities and social entrepreneurship.\n\nShe said it is always a bit precarious to subject people's cherished truths to any kind of critical analysis, but it needs to be done. If people just follow along blindly without questioning their beliefs, it could lead them down a treacherous path.\n\n\"I just think it's dangerous. That's how people end up being in neo Nazi groups,\" she said. \"Your ability to be co-opted by truth, whatever that is, without imagining that there are other truths or that you might get that wrong, that's your one step away from fascism.\"\n\nJoseph Georges, a fifth-year criminal justice major at the University of Guelph, walked away from the workshop a little more critical about his own beliefs of what is right and wrong.\n\n\"I think the talk was important because it tells people that it's OK to not always be right,\" he said.\n\n\"I have a problem with people taking things at face value and then making big decisions on it.\"\n\nHe said it is important to put yourself in other people's shoes, and never to judge people because \"what they project, there could be so many other things that are underneath that are making them do that.\"", "article_metadata": {"RATING": "GENERAL", "DESCRIPTION": "Karen Houle is only sure of two things: composting is good, and it\u2019s bad to flush dental floss down the toilet.
