We also discussed the state of journalism today and how it\u2019s changed over the years. Joining me live will be Jeff Kropf, a political pro from Oregon. We\u2019ll look into the recent prisoner swap that has Washington in an uproar.\n\nWe stream live from 8:00 - 9:00 PM Eastern time. A podcast will be available shortly after the end of the show.
