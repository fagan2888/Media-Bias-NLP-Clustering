For instance, Saturday from 7 a.m. until noon is the Jessica Ghawi giveSPORTS Equipment Drive, where people can donate new and gently used sports equipment at the Pepsi Center (Camry Lot North). It was the dream of Jessi \u2014 a friend, a spunky redhead and an aspiring sports journalist \u2014 to bring sports into the lives of the underprivileged.\n\nShe then lost her life in the Aurora theater shootings.\n\nOnly after, did her dream come true.\n\nAnd so, at last summer\u2019s equipment drive, you might have dropped off, say, a basketball. Here\u2019s what happened next:\n\nLast Christmas, a 5-year-old boy named Demarco came sprinting toward Latoshia Jackson and exclaimed: \u201cMom, there\u2019s an elf outside!\u201d\n\nThat night, like so many others, Jackson was deeply depressed. In April of 2013, she had moved her seven children from Memphis, Tenn., to Denver. Really, they escaped.\n\n\u201cThe gangs were trying to initiate my daughter and son,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cThey didn\u2019t join, and (the gangs) went in, full force. I was asleep, and I was in a complicated pregnancy and I woke up to my daughter being dragged out of the house so a bunch of these girls could jump her. And we had a drive-by shooting right next to us. I couldn\u2019t take it anymore. \u2026\n\n\u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for my children, honestly I think I would\u2019ve given up a long time ago. My children are my life. Going through some of the things I\u2019ve been through, and knowing they\u2019re counting on me, it gives me more of a reason to strive.\u201d\n\nWithin the first month in Denver, the family didn\u2019t have any legitimate housing options. They were homeless, bouncing from shelters to basements to projects, a single mother and seven children.\n\nOn Christmas, pastor Bryan Sederwall of the Denver Dream Center had gathered a group to deliver presents in the projects. There was a Santa. Elves, too. Little Demarco found his mother, and the serendipitous Santa came into the Jacksons\u2019 lives.\n\n\u201cCorn tortilla shells with sour cream was basically their Christmas meal,\u201d Sederwall said.\n\nPastor B, as they call Sederwall, gave the Jacksons his phone number. Said he could help. Neither knew what would happen next.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve really become my family,\u201d Jackson said of Pastor B and his group from Denver Dream Center.\n\nNow, this isn\u2019t some cheery, everything\u2019s-fine-now story. Not yet, anyway. Jackson remains unemployed, and the family was homeless until last week, when they were finally approved for Section 8 housing.\n\nThe kids had slept on floors. The kids weren\u2019t able to really be kids. Pastor B provided some support, mentoring and counseling along the way. Also, of course, faith.\n\nAnd Denver Dream Center is partnered with A Precious Child, which puts on the giveSPORTS Equipment Drive. So that basketball? Pastor B gave it to Demarco.\n\n\u201cBasketball is what they love to do,\u201d Jackson said of her sons. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of therapeutic to them. We\u2019ve been through a lot since we\u2019ve been here. We\u2019ve lost a lot. For them to have something that I know for a fact couldn\u2019t afford, it was just a huge blessing for the donations \u2014 it might be something small for some people, but it\u2019s something huge.\u201d\n\nOne basketball. It gave these kids this rare emotion called happiness. It gave them an outlet. It gave them normalcy.\n\n\u201cThey go to different rec centers to play,\u201d Pastor B said, \u201cand they just sort of come alive. \u2026 You see these kids smile.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m sure Jessi is looking down and smiling, too.\n\nBenjamin Hochman: bhochman@denverpost.com or twitter.com/hochman", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Hochman: Legacy of Jessica Ghawi a gift of giving, happiness", "title": "Hochman: Legacy of Jessica Ghawi a gift of giving, happiness", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/08/22/hochman-legacy-of-jessica-ghawi-a-gift-of-giving-happiness/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140822_102642_givesports.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140822_102642_givesports.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-08-22T20:54:52+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T10:30:51+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "\u201cThey go to different rec centers to play,\u201d Pastor B said, \u201cand they just sort of come alive.\nOn Christmas, pastor Bryan Sederwall of the Denver Dream Center had gathered a group to deliver presents in the projects.\n\u201cThey\u2019ve really become my family,\u201d Jackson said of Pastor B and his group from Denver Dream Center.\nPastor B gave it to Demarco.\nAnd Denver Dream Center is partnered with A Precious Child, which puts on the giveSPORTS Equipment Drive."}
