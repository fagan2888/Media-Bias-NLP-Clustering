Being forced to change because your insurance company has a \u201cnarrow network\u201d is quite another.\n\nAs health insurers look for ways to cut costs, narrowing their provider networks is an increasingly popular option. But not all consumers are happy with their lack of choices, even when a narrowed network translates to a cheaper policy.\n\nA health care network is a group of medical providers who contract with a health insurance company to provide services to insured consumers at lowered rates. As a patient, if you visit a doctor or hospital in-network, your insurance company will pay a greater percentage of your care. If you go out of network, you\u2019ll pay more or even be stuck with the entire bill.\n\nA McKinsey study found about 48 percent of all exchange networks are considered narrowed, and in large cities, such networks account for 60 percent of those present. Though these restricted networks aren\u2019t new, they are growing in prevalence.\n\nWhere Narrowed Networks Came From\n\nNarrowed networks didn\u2019t begin with the Affordable Care Act. These networks were at the center of tightly controlled health maintenance organizations in the late 1980s and early 1990s. They spurred considerable consumer backlash and led lawmakers to propose minimum standards for provider networks. Since the implementation of the ACA, and a resurgence of creative methods to control health care costs, narrow networks have again become a topic of controversy.\n\nThe ACA restricted many methods that insurers were accustomed to using to control costs. High deductibles are now capped, denials due to pre-existing conditions are banned and health insurance plans must provide essential benefits in order to be compliant with the new law.\n\nNetwork control is one of the few remaining methods for cost control, and with consumers demanding a wide range of plans to choose from, network adjustments allow insurers to offer a variety of plans at several price points.\n\nWhat Narrowed Networks Mean for Providers\n\nAs health insurers seek out hospitals and providers that boost their bottom line, these providers, in theory, have an incentive to offer the highest-quality care at a lower price, increasing the likelihood that they\u2019ll earn themselves a spot in certain restrictive networks. Donald Furman, chief strategy officer for Alignment Healthcare, says these networks are seen more as selective rather than restrictive, from a medical provider\u2019s point of view.\n\nHealth insurance companies \u201chave assembled a network of high-quality providers who will ultimately improve outcomes for their patients,\u201d he says. \u201cDoctors who are part of a narrow network will see more patients from these exchange plans and will benefit when they work as a team under a coordinated care model.\u201d\n\nFor patients, Furman says, the benefits can be a lower premium and higher-quality care. But, as consumer backlash shows, narrowed networks have obvious problems.", "article_metadata": {"usn-stitial-fact": "{\"slug\":\"160202\",\"text\":\"Heart failure occurs when the heart can\u2019t pump enough blood and oxygen to support other organs in the body.\"}", "usn-comments-mode": "facebook", "description": "A narrowed network may mean changing doctors when you change health insurance or paying more.", "zone": "healthplans/homepage/articles", "author": "Elizabeth Renter", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "A narrowed network may mean changing doctors when you change health insurance or paying more.", "title": "Narrowed Networks: How to Navigate Fewer Choices in Health Care", "url": "http://health.usnews.com/health-news/health-insurance/articles/2014/12/23/narrowed-networks-how-to-navigate-fewer-choices-in-health-care", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/2a/e7/af2a7ffc4158bc273c5a4d861809/141217-worriedseniors-stock.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"title": "Narrowed Networks: How to Navigate Fewer Choices in Health Care - US News", "description": "A narrowed network may mean changing doctors when you change health insurance or paying more.", "card": "summary", "site": "@USNews"}, "usn-platform-id": "a", "site": "health-news", "keywords": "LTHealth [Consumer Advice],healthwellness [Consumer Advice],health care reform,health insurance,doctors,HealthInsurance-Bucket-Obamacare [Consumer Advice],Elizabeth Renter", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "social_id": "http://t.usnews.com/Z4zpwq", "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "published_at": "2014-12-23", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/usnewsandworldreport", "published_time": "2014-12-23"}, "usn-content-type": "article", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/dims4/USNEWS/3a0ce43/2147483647/crop/313x313%2B142%2B0/resize/80x80/quality/85/?url=%2Fcmsmedia%2F2a%2Fe7%2Faf2a7ffc4158bc273c5a4d861809%2Fresizes%2F500%2F141217-worriedseniors-stock.jpg", "viewport": "width=980", "news_keywords": "health insurance, affordable care act"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0028\"", "article_summary": "But not all consumers are happy with their lack of choices, even when a narrowed network translates to a cheaper policy.\nA health care network is a group of medical providers who contract with a health insurance company to provide services to insured consumers at lowered rates.\nWhere Narrowed Networks Came FromNarrowed networks didn\u2019t begin with the Affordable Care Act.\nSince the implementation of the ACA, and a resurgence of creative methods to control health care costs, narrow networks have again become a topic of controversy.\nAs health insurers look for ways to cut costs, narrowing their provider networks is an increasingly popular option."}
