It is similar to the regional response strategy that was instituted in western Oklahoma on February 16.\n\n\u201cThe western and central Oklahoma actions combined cover over 10,000 square miles and more than 600 Arbuckle disposal wells.\u201d Baker said.\n\nBaker said the goal of the central Oklahoma plan is to reduce the total volume disposed in the area to 40 percent below the 2014 total.\n\n\u201cThis means a reduction of more than 300,000 barrels a day from the 2015 average injection volumes,\u201d Baker explained.\n\nIn a separate action, the OGCD is also expanding the size of the \u201cArea of Interest\u201d (AOI), bringing more restrictions to disposal well operations in areas that have not yet seen major earthquake activity.\n\n\u201cThis will result in 118 more Arbuckle disposal wells being covered by so-called \u201cyellow light\u201d earthquake precautions. These include having to prove the well has not been drilled too deep in order to keep operating, and daily and weekly volume recording and reporting requirements,\u201d Baker said. \u201cIt also eliminates the possibility of administrative approval of a new Arbuckle disposal well application. The AOI expansion is a proactive move to get ahead of the earthquake activity.\n\n\u201cThe central Oklahoma volume reduction plan covers an area where we have taken numerous, localized actions over the past 12 months, such as in the Cushing, Crescent, and Edmond areas. But the research and data has grown to provide the basis needed to both expand into a regional approach for volume reduction and increase the size of the AOI. \u201d said Baker.\n\nBaker said the speed at which the latest actions were developed is a major step forward.\n\n\u201cOur working relationship with the Oklahoma Geological Survey continues to bear more fruit, greatly helped by the fact that we have been able to add staff to the earthquake effort as a result of the emergency funding from Governor Fallin and grants from the Oklahoma Energy Resources Board and the Groundwater Protection Council,\u201d said Baker. \u201cWe have also begun the process of a huge upgrade in our computing power, which will give us far more powerful tools and provide more data to researchers.\u201d\n\nThe central Oklahoma volume reduction plan will be phased in over two months in keeping with recommendations from researchers, who warn against sudden pressure changes. The first stage starts on Monday.\n\nNotification of well operators began on Thursday, March 3. It is important to note that researchers agree that any decrease in earthquakes that may result from such plans is rarely immediate, and must be evaluated over the course of several months.", "article_metadata": {"wn-build": "XSLT-7.1-17", "Description": "The Oklahoma Corporation Commission\u2019s (OCC) Oil and Gas Conservation Division (OGCD) is continuing to move forward in its response to the risk of triggered earthquakes in Oklahoma.", "author": "News9.com", "og": {"url": "http://www.news9.com/story/31404146/occ-releases-latest-regional-earthquake-response-plan", "image": "http://KWTV.images.worldnow.com/images/10043174_G.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "The Oklahoma Corporation Commission\u2019s (OCC) Oil and Gas Conservation Division (OGCD) is continuing to move forward in its response to the risk of triggered earthquakes in Oklahoma.", "title": "OCC Releases Latest Regional Earthquake Response Plan"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://KWTV.images.worldnow.com/images/10043174_G.jpg", "description": "The Oklahoma Corporation Commission\u2019s (OCC) Oil and Gas Conservation Division (OGCD) is continuing to move forward in its response to the risk of triggered earthquakes in Oklahoma.", "card": "summary", "title": "OCC Releases Latest Regional Earthquake Response Plan"}, "wnreadableurl": "occ-releases-latest-regional-earthquake-response-plan", "ROBOTS": "index,follow,noarchive", "owner": "KWTV", "fb": {"app_id": 538140636230283}, "date": "2016/03/07", "KEYWORDS": "oklahoma city,okc,media,news,weather,tv,cbs,local,tornado,storm,oklahoma,newsok,channel 9,channel nine,news 9,television,this morning,live radar,kwtv,sports,video,live streaming,interactive", "wn-version": "ContainerE-Story", "wn-base": "IIS24", "verify-v1": "d5ZN+GNiazjgWlnr3WHikwraMvFljdUSLMgex4CGnc8=", "news_keywords": "oklahoma city,okc,media,news,weather,tv,cbs,local,tornado,storm,oklahoma,newsok,channel 9,channel nine,news 9,television,this morning,live radar,kwtv,sports,video,live streaming,interactive"}, "article_summary": "\u201cThe western and central Oklahoma actions combined cover over 10,000 square miles and more than 600 Arbuckle disposal wells.\u201d Baker said.\n\u201cThis will result in 118 more Arbuckle disposal wells being covered by so-called \u201cyellow light\u201d earthquake precautions.\nOGCD director Tim Baker said the central Oklahoma action will cover more than 5,000 square miles and more than 400 Arbuckle disposal wells.\n\u201cIt also eliminates the possibility of administrative approval of a new Arbuckle disposal well application.\n\u201cThe central Oklahoma volume reduction plan covers an area where we have taken numerous, localized actions over the past 12 months, such as in the Cushing, Crescent, and Edmond areas."}
