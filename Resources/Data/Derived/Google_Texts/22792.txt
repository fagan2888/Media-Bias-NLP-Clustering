The Denver Broncos received a team rating of 90 in Madden NFL, the top score in the AFC, Electronic Arts unveiled Wednesday.

Peyton Manning (97), Von Miller (96), Matt Prater (95) and Demaryius Thomas (93) were listed as the Broncos’ top four players by EA.

From EA Sports:

How can the Broncos possibly improve an offense that shattered records in 2013? Five-time MVP is back as the top-rated quarterack in Madden 15. Despite the loss of Eric Decker in free agency, the Broncos still have an embarrasment of pass-catching riches in DeMaryius Thomas, Wes Welker, Julius Thomas and newly acquired Emmanuel Sanders. On the ground, the Broncos must get improvements from Montee Ball and Ronnie Hillman to account for the loss of Knowshon Moreno. After being shredded by Russell Wilson and Co. in Super Bowl XLVIII, the Broncos addressed the defensive side of the ball by bringing in veterans DeMarcus Ware (90 OVR) and Aqib Talib (90 OVR) to help shore up the pass rush and secondary respectively. In the trenches, defensive tackle Terrance Knighton (88 OVR) was dominant in Denver’s run to the AFC Championship.

The Broncos are tied with San Francisco for the second-highest rating in the game. Defending Super Bowl champion Seattle has the highest rating with 91.
