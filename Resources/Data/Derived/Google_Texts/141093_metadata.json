The latest U.S. Census bureau estimates are that about 358,000 Kansans have no health insurance.\n\nThe marketplace website for Kansas was available mid-morning Tuesday, the first day it was open, but a message said enough people were visiting that logging in could take time.\n\nBut Kansas congressman Tim Huelskamp said when he tried at midnight, he got an error message. Huelskamp is a Republican who strongly opposes the health care overhaul.\n\nPrevious story:\n\nAdvocates of the health care overhaul have seemingly coalesced around a unified message for Kansas consumers. They urge people not to rush to enroll until glitches in the system are worked out in the coming weeks.\n\nSome Kansas health care groups still have not hired all the \"navigators\" for which they have been awarded federal grants to explain the plans. Some are still training for many other new hires. Some material like Spanish-language pamphlets ordered in June have not arrived yet.\n\nEnrollment begins Tuesday and consumers have until Dec. 15 to enroll if they want their coverage to start in January.\n\nThe Kansas Insurance Commissioner urged the public Monday to give the exchanges time to work out the bugs. She says why hurry -- let someone else be the guinea pig.\n\nYet Rep. Tim Huelskamp attempted to sign into the exchange at midnight. He released several screen shots of what happened, including one with a \"system is down\" message and another with a security question page lacking questions.\n\n\u201cWe have been warned time and time again that ObamaCare is not ready for prime time,\" Huelskamp said in a statement. \"It turns out that is right.\"", "article_metadata": {"medium": "video", "description": "Kansas consumers may be experiencing delays as they go online to buy health insurance coverage in a new federally run marketplace, and one congressman has concluded it was not ready.", "language": "english", "author": "Associated Press", "og": {"description": "Kansas consumers may be experiencing delays as they go online to buy health insurance coverage in a new federally run marketplace, and one congressman has concluded it was not ready.", "title": "UPDATE: Kansas Braces For Opening Of Health Care Exchanges", "url": "http://www.kake.com/home/headlines/Kansas-Braces-For-Opening-Of-Health-Care-Exchanges-225919551.html", "image": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/iupl/D4D/608/D4D6081437F34C1486FFF9EFACF45B7E", "video": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/BCF/A00/BCFA00B27139429D9DAD2B1F5D5A655E.mp4", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.kake.com", "description": "Kansas consumers may be experiencing delays as they go online to buy health insurance coverage in a new federally run marketplace, and one congressman has concluded it was not ready.", "title": "UPDATE: Kansas Braces For Opening Of Health Care Exchanges", "url": "http://www.kake.com/home/headlines/Kansas-Braces-For-Opening-Of-Health-Care-Exchanges-225919551.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/health+care13.jpg", "creator": "@KAKEnews", "site": "@KAKEnews", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "video_type": "video/mp4", "video_height": 288, "keywords": "UPDATE: Kansas Braces For Opening Of Health Care Exchanges", "google-site-verification": "H0mev8O__gMqb34WcvOyZgBXFMRQZvDAQ0YTSGJ9hGQ", "video_width": 512, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "UPDATE Kansas Braces For Opening"}, "article_summary": "Some Kansas health care groups still have not hired all the \"navigators\" for which they have been awarded federal grants to explain the plans.\nPrevious story:Advocates of the health care overhaul have seemingly coalesced around a unified message for Kansas consumers.\nThe online marketplace is a key part of the federal overhaul of health care, and it's meant to help uninsured Americans find coverage.\nHuelskamp is a Republican who strongly opposes the health care overhaul.\nBut Kansas congressman Tim Huelskamp said when he tried at midnight, he got an error message."}
