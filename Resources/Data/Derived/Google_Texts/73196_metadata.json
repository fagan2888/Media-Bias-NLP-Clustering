Its technology connects health care providers, health systems and patients, filling gaps that widened after the passage of the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cThe market need is significant for what we do, which is bring an outstanding level of service to the health care industry,\u201d said Brad Bostic, the founder, chairman and chief executive officer of hc1. \u201cAnybody who has been through a health care experience or who has a friend or family member who has been through it, you hear pretty consistent stories of professionals not knowing who you are, waiting forever for a callback or not finding out what a lab result was.\n\n\u201cAll those things going forward need to be fixed.\u201d\n\nThe firm's software connects the entire medical process in the cloud, allowing medical professionals or patients easy access to medical information. Doctors can share information with specialists, billing is centralized, and tracking patient testing is a breeze, Bostic said. It also lets people know when they should go for checkups, he added.\n\nFor instance, if someone is overdue for a physical or other routine procedure, hc1's technology can alert a patient via a text message or an electronic communication that they should see their primary care physician.\n\nAll of these features help businesses watch their bottom lines. The firm boasts that it can eliminate unnecessary medical testing, cut down on no-show patients and keep everyone on the same page, allowing for cost reductions across the board.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s this big rise of consumerism and the shift to a payment model that rewards you for delivering better quality,\u201d Bostic said, adding that hc1 is similar to ordering something online: You know what to expect and when to receive it.\n\nThe company, already at about 100 employees, plans to add 25 workers to its roster this year. Its financial information is private, and Bostic declined to share it with IndyStar.\n\nThe company has been adopted by more than 7,000 subscribers across 700 health systems, laboratories and medical facilities around the world. Some of its big-name clients are the Cleveland Clinic, Sonic Healthcare and the Nationwide Children\u2019s Hospital.\n\nBuy Photo Lizzy Mooney, hc1.com content marketing manager, works from the cloud-based Indianapolis company offices.

Eskenazi\u2019s no-show rate was 35 percent this time last year, and hc1\u2019s technology, which allows the health provider to text patients or send them appointment reminders, has improved business, said Parveen Chand, Eskenazi\u2019s chief operating officer.\n\n\u201cFrom a patient-care standpoint, it\u2019s helped. I haven\u2019t been able to quantify a dollar amount just yet,\u201d he said, adding that Eskenazi is considering expanding its relationship with hc1.\n\nMike Langellier, president and chief executive officer of TechPoint, an Indianapolis organization that promotes and accelerates growth of Indiana\u2019s technology community, said hc1 is primed for expansion because it fills a unique niche in the health care marketplace.\n\nThe company not only weaves together a network of health care solutions \u2014 it provides unparalleled cybersecurity for the information it collects and stores, Langellier said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m hopeful about hc1,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re at that nexus.\u201d\n\nThe company was smart because it identified a need that no one filled in the health care market, Langellier said. It took the best technology from cloud-based computing and applied it to widening fractures in the health care system, he said.\n\n\u201cThey created a software platform that can help to create that Amazon-like experience for health care,\u201d he said. \u201cHealth care systems can communicate with their patients with the same level of sophistication and precision that Amazon brings to its retail customers.\u201d\n\nThat innovation was one of the things that helped hc1 become a 2015 finalist for the Stratus Award, which recognizes companies and individuals that are innovating in cloud technology and provide offerings that are \u201ctruly differentiated in the market.\u201d\n\nThe award was judged by business executives and reflects how specialized hc1 is, said Russ Fordyce, managing director of the Stratus Awards.\n\n\u201cThey really saw that the model in a \u2026 way that was the bee\u2019s knees,\u201d Fordyce said. \u201cProviding that level of security and privacy in a cloud-based infrastructure was pretty unique.\n\n\u201cMost of the time that is pretty hard to do.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not the only recognition hc1 has garnered. The company earned the Red Herring Global Top 100 Winner in 2014 and 2013, 2013 Indiana Companies to Watch Spotlight Award and the 2013 MIRA Award Winner for Health Technology Innovation and Excellence.\n\nFor Bostic, hc1 isn\u2019t just a business venture, it\u2019s a personal mission. Yes, the technology helps streamline a health provider\u2019s business, but it also helps people.\n\n\u201cIt was recognizing that this was a need in health care,\u201d Bostic said. \u201cUntil the incentives were there to do it, people were not very quick to adopt. This is why over the past few years we\u2019ve gotten adopted across over 650 health care sites in six countries.\u201d\n\nCall Star reporter Kris Turner at (317) 444-6047.
