CREDIT: AP\n\nThe 12-way race to replace Rep. Steve Stockman (R-TX) ended in a runoff Tuesday night, while the congressman lost his Senate primary bid for Sen. John Cornyn\u2019s seat. Known for campaign stunts like raffling off an assault rifle and calling for President Obama\u2019s impeachment, Stockman sets a high bar of controversy for his potential successors, Brian Babin or Ben Streusand, to top. Still, based on a ThinkProgress review of candidate footage, either candidate could be up for the challenge in the safe Republican district.\n\nBrian Babin is Woodville\u2019s former mayor and a dentist who has campaigned with the slogan, \u201cIt\u2019s going to take a dentist to pull the teeth out of Obamacare.\u201d Babin is against comprehensive immigration reform, but does support building a wall on U.S.-Mexico border. Channeling fellow Texan Gov. Rick Perry\u2019s (R) famous \u201coops\u201d moment, Babin declared at one campaign event he does not \u201cbelieve we need the Department of Energy,\u201d and also wants to abolish the Departments of Homeland Security and Education.\n\nLike Stockman, who\u2019s battling allegations of violating campaign finance law, Babin was ensnared in his own financial ethics case from a failed 1996 congressional bid. He paid a staggering sum of $20,000 in civil fines and $5,000 in excessive contributions for taking illegal contributions and routing campaign donations through a GOP consulting firm that claimed it did not advocate for or against candidates.\n\nBen Streusand, the other contender for the seat, is a Tea Party favorite and the former Chairman of the Texas Americans For Prosperity \u2014 a group connected to the Koch brothers.\n\nStreusand was enthusiastically in favor of an indefinite government shutdown last fall. \u201cIt\u2019s not that important to have the government open and running,\u201d he said, arguing that House Republicans should have extended the shutdown forever when their anti-Obamacare demands weren\u2019t met. \u201cIt\u2019s much more important to walk away from this battle without folding like a cheap suit\u2014without folding like Republicans typically do in the House of Representatives,\u201d he said. Streusand didn\u2019t think sequestration had any negative consequences, either, saying he never \u201cheard anybody complaining all that much about it.\u201d\n\nHe does not believe in any corporate tax rate at all, saying the country would be better off if \u201cwe simply eliminated the corporate tax rate in its entirety. The proceeds would flow down to employees, wages would rise, and we would be able to eliminate this patchwork tax code that distorts every nook and cranny of the American economy.\u201d He\u2019s also claimed gay marriage opponents live in perpetual fear of retribution for their views. \u201cOur Texas values are under assault by Hollywood, by the media, and by the federal government,\u201d he said. \u201cThose of us who support traditional marriage must live in fear of retribution by our employers for speaking our mind. Those of us that believe life starts at conception are attacked for our Judeo-Christian beliefs.\u201d\n\nThe two candidates face off in a May runoff as they compete for the seat in one of Texas\u2019 most Republican districts.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "Stockman's potential successors could be up for the challenge.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "Stockman's potential successors could be up for the challenge.", "title": "The Next Steve Stockman: Can The Craziest Seat In Congress Get Even Crazier?", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/politics/2014/03/06/3358481/stockman-district-race/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/AP10835621288.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Stockman's potential successors could be up for the challenge.", "creator": "@rebleber", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/AP10835621288-321x214.jpg", "title": "The Next Steve Stockman: Can The Craziest Seat In Congress Get Even Crazier?", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-politics", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/AP10835621288.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/AP10835621288.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2014-03-06T10:35:58+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdfd47\"", "article_summary": "Politics The Next Steve Stockman: Can The Craziest Seat In Congress Get Even Crazier?\nCREDIT: APThe 12-way race to replace Rep.
