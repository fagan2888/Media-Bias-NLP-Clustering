In the first few weeks the exchanges have been live, however, they have been marred by spotty website access, frustrating an Administration that had hoped to enroll half a million people in the insurance markets during the first month, according to an internal AP memo.\n\nNext month, the Administration will release the first actual enrollment totals. Those figures will help determine if the program will reach the Congressional Budget Office\u2019s estimate of 7 million sign-ups during the first six months.\n\nThe President will address problems with the rollout Monday during an event at the White House. Administration officials also will visit parts of the country in coming weeks to encourage sign-ups.\n\nStaffing in call centers has been hiked by about 50%, and the Administration is urging people to sign up via phone until the website run by the federal government is more accessible.\n\nRepublican opposition to the new health care law has been so strident that many of them pushed an effort to defund the law, leading to the recent 16-day government shutdown.\n\nHouse Republicans have also called for the resignation of Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius because of the problems.\n\n[AP]\n\nThis story has been updated to reflect the announced updates to the HealthCare.gov website code.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Updated Sunday, Oct. 20, 2:42 p.m. The Obama Administration announced Sunday it had recruited experts from the private and government tech sectors to update the code on the HealthCare.gov website, Politico\u00a0reports.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "TIME.com", "description": "HealthCare.gov code has been updated several times", "title": "Tech Experts Tapped to Fix Health Care Website | TIME.com", "url": "http://nation.time.com/2013/10/20/officials-nearly-half-million-health-care-applications-filed/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/time2012/library/assets/images/time-logo-og.png", "type": "article"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "News, Headlines, Stories, Video from Around the Nation", "fb": {"admins": "1124331582,512158401,808970553,100000018008769", "app_id": 53177223193}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://nation.time.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/c065f7f4495e21fd12fbfa8af086eafd?s=16", "application-name": "U.S.", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/time"}, "keywords": "national, affordable health care act, health care, obamacare", "google-site-verification": "RuBIxOwStTsi-KOuQpMhdd-F4UmaxCoOJAOJ8D2hh8Y", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "national, affordable health care act, health care, obamacare"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdaec2\"", "article_summary": "The Obama Administration announced Sunday it had recruited experts from the private and government tech sectors to update the code on the HealthCare.gov website, Politico reports.\nAdministration officials also will visit parts of the country in coming weeks to encourage sign-ups.\nRepublican opposition to the new health care law has been so strident that many of them pushed an effort to defund the law, leading to the recent 16-day government shutdown.\nStaffing in call centers has been hiked by about 50%, and the Administration is urging people to sign up via phone until the website run by the federal government is more accessible.\n[AP]This story has been updated to reflect the announced updates to the HealthCare.gov website code."}
