Welcome to Essential Politics, a new newsletter from the Los Angeles Times. I’m Christina Bellantoni, assistant managing editor for politics and your host today.

Californians are about to get some face time with Hillary Clinton — some rich ones, at least.

The former secretary of state is slated to be in Los Angeles this weekend for a series of fundraisers before heading up to the Bay Area.

Clinton’s campaign manager Robby Mook was in the state this week to let any uneasy donors know that the political professionals back at campaign headquarters in Brooklyn have it all under control, writes Evan Halper, describing Mook’s visit as “high stakes behind-the-scenes work."

Donors who were invited to join the conversation told Halper that Mook was visiting homes of Esprit clothing founder Susie Tompkins Buell in San Francisco and businesswoman Amy Rao, a prodigious fundraiser. The goal: to reassure, re-energize and recommit some key players in the Clinton West Coast money machine after a less-than-stellar summer and ahead of the Oct. 13 Democratic primary debate.

Last month I reported on two of the Democrat’s fundraisers planned for this month.

We’ve got some new details on those Clinton events kicking off on Sunday afternoon. Billed as chances for a “photo with HRC," and the last chance to see her “before the first big Dem debate," there are three events that allow for photos with the candidate for $2,700 per person.

“Space is limited but there are more tiers and more opportunities for folks to support the campaign and participate, so please share with your friends, family and colleagues," Clinton National Finance Committee member Michael Gilmore wrote in an email obtained by the Los Angeles Times.

She will appear at the homes of Rob and Shari Friedman and Noshaba and Dr. Asif Mahmood, as well as at the swanky Perch Rooftop in downtown Los Angeles. Another email from National Finance Committee members Sim and Debra Farar and obtained by The Times warned, “SPACE IS LIMITED and we expect this event to reach capacity QUICKLY."

If you talked with Mook, or if you plan to attend the upcoming fundraisers, we’d sure love to hear from you. Don’t be a stranger.
