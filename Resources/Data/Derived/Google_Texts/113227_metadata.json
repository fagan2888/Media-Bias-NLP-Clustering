And clients don\u2019t really care about how much lawyers make.\u201d\n\nIt was virtually impossible to distinguish one firm from another in a way that would resonate with clients, he said.\n\n\u201cIf law firms, like other businesses, could aspire to be different. . .that could be a game-changer,\u201d Glincher said.\n\nGlincher decided it was time to make his firm stand out. Nixon Peabody, which has about 170 attorneys and staff in Washington, passed up on using a branding firm that had worked with dozens of top U.S. law firms, instead turning to New York-and-London-based brand strategy firm Wolff Olins, which has designed campaigns for Spotify, Adidas and Sony, to help them create the image of a firm that is less stuffy and more approachable than the typical large law firm.\n\nThe firm revamped its Web site to look more like that of a design firm than a law firm. The new logo is in neon green and attorney bios are written in the first person, including each lawyer\u2019s response to the question, \u201cWhat do you see on the horizon?\u201d \u2014 their personal thoughts on the direction of the industry where most of their clients do business. The language is intentionally pared down.\n\n\u201cWe looked at some of our old stuff and thought, \u2018Who understands this?\u2019 \u201d Glincher said. \u201cIt could be on Jay Leno headlines. It didn\u2019t make any sense, it was all written in legalese. An average business person reading it would be scratching their heads. We tried to write it in plain straightforward language so that anyone in the business world could look at it and say, \u2018I get what this means.\u2019 \u201d\n\nGlincher said these initiatives and the rebranding efforts are partly a response to the economic downturn that began in 2008 and forced corporations to dramatically cut back on legal spending.\n\n\u201cIf business kept booming, would we change our ways? Maybe not,\u201d he said. \u201cThe slowing demand in the industry forced our business and our industry to be more like every other business. . .it had to think about how it was going to be different and how it was going to act going forward.\u201d\n\nNixon Peabody is known for taking unconventional approaches to solving some of the legal industry\u2019s nagging problems. To counter the lack of diversity at large law firms, Nixon Peabody leaders in 2010 began urging lawyers to log at least 40 hours a year on diversity-related activities like recruitment and training efforts. To take on the industry\u2019s notoriously slow pace of innovation, D.C. managing partner Jeff Lesk started requiring lawyers in his practice group to come up with an \u201cinnovative\u201d idea every year that would ultimately impact how much they get paid.\n\nThe current rebranding effort is no different. One of the firm\u2019s primary goals is to have clients \u2014 typically companies \u2014 think of the firm\u2019s attorneys as business partners, rather than just someone to go to strictly for legal advice.\n\n\u201cWe need expertise in areas where our clients work, and we need to do this on our own dime,\u201d Glincher said. \u201cWe need to be predictive of the future, and essentially be looking around the corner to help our clients do business better.\u201d\n\nAs part of this effort, Nixon Peabody is investing more heavily in a program called NP Capital Connector, created in 2010, and an affiliate business unit called the Institute for Professional and Executive Development (IPED). Both put on networking events and industry-specific conferences to help connect businesses, investors and capital.\n\nSince Nixon Peabody does a lot of work in affordable housing development, IPED hosts events for developers and investors that feature the firm\u2019s attorneys as experts. Getting all the players together in one room gets the juices flowing \u2014 people start talking about trends and potential deals \u2014 which positions Nixon Peabody to win new business if future deals come out of those meetings.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Law firm Nixon Peabody seeks to differentiate itself from other large law firms", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=1216470", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Law firm Nixon Peabody seeks to differentiate itself from other large law firms", "title": "Efforts to be less stuffy, more forward-thinking for clients will help firm grow business, CEO says", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/capitalbusiness/2014/01/05/53614756-6bf8-11e3-aecc-85cb037b7236_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2014/01/02/Others/Images/2014-01-02/_MG_21101388693466.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@WapoCat"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/capitalbusiness/2014/01/05/53614756-6bf8-11e3-aecc-85cb037b7236_story.html", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "capbiztopnews, Nixon Peabody, law firms, Andrew Glincher", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=1216470"}, "news_keywords": "capbiztopnews, Nixon Peabody, law firms, Andrew Glincher", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "eomportal-uuid": "53614756-6bf8-11e3-aecc-85cb037b7236"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd613\"", "article_summary": "The firm revamped its Web site to look more like that of a design firm than a law firm.\nSince Nixon Peabody does a lot of work in affordable housing development, IPED hosts events for developers and investors that feature the firm\u2019s attorneys as experts.\n\u201cIf law firms, like other businesses, could aspire to be different.\n\u201cI was looking at the [American Lawyer] 100 list of the largest firms, pretending to be a client,\u201d said Glincher, who at the time was a rookie managing partner for the law firm Nixon Peabody.\nTo counter the lack of diversity at large law firms, Nixon Peabody leaders in 2010 began urging lawyers to log at least 40 hours a year on diversity-related activities like recruitment and training efforts."}
