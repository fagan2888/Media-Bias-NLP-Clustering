And this is going beyond crippling Barack Obama\u2019s presidency, destroying his credibility. It is destroying I think or damaging severely the fundamental progressive idea, the philosophy of the Democratic Party that government can really do great and good things and can do them well, given enough time and effort. I\u2019ve never seen such damage to the liberal idea, I think, since 1968 when Lyndon Johnson\u2019s presidency was broken.\u201d\n\nBuchanan listed the problems with the Obamacare law but added that he thought some of these pitfalls were intentional.\n\n\u201cOK, 5 million people have lost their health care and can\u2019t get it and millions of others who have employer plans are about to lose their health care. What do you care about whether some website is 80 percent working or not? The whole thing is not being able to go to certain hospitals, they\u2019re losing doctors, their premiums are increasing, their benefits are decreasing, they\u2019re losing some plans, forced to get others. This whole thing is a debacle. And quite frankly, I do think this is whole thing was planned this way, as a redistribution of wealth and redistribution of funds, money and resources from one group of Americans to another.\u201d\n\nBuchanan said that Obama was supposed to be to liberalism what former President Ronald Reagan was to conservatism, but it\u2019s not working out that way, mainly because of this law, which has further tarnished the image of government in the eyes of the public.\n\n\u201cWell you know Dana, by now it\u2019s been two months, and as Churchill once said, the rubble is beginning to bounce,\u201d Buchanan continued. \u201cOne after another after another of these stories are adding to the public\u2019s dissatisfaction with what Obamacare is producing \u2014 their distrust of government. And I don\u2019t think this is going to stop. because even if you have the Obamacare website up there at 100 percent, you mean the other people losing their health care and hospitals and doctors, all the rest, that is going through to the new year.\n\n\u201cYou know, Barack Obama promised he was going to be a transformational president,\u201d Buchanan said. \u201cHe was going to be for progressives what Ronald Reagan was for conservatives. And we now see his basic program, his legacy program \u2014 his great achievement is becoming increasingly a great disaster and a great failure. So I think it is not only again the president that\u2019s got a problem, it is the philosophy of Democratic Party, and I don\u2019t know whenever again a president will attempt this great leap forward with government.\u201d\n\nPerino asked if there were any outs for Obama and what Buchanan would advise Obama to do if he were still a presidential adviser. According to Buchanan, there\u2019s not much he can do.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what they can do, Dana, because I think it\u2019s baked in the cake,\u201d Buchanan said. \u201cI do know this, there should have been aides close to the president who every time they heard some report that something was going wrong with his top program and he didn\u2019t know it, they would say, \u2018Mr. President, this rollout could be a real problem. And we\u2019re hearing this from HHS. And people came over from that computer firm and they told us this. Maybe we ought to hold this thing up for a year, maybe even if we have to give in to the Republicans and we get some egg on our face, put it off for a year because we bet the farm on this, this is our number one program, it\u2019s your legacy, we believe in it, it\u2019s our philosophy. You don\u2019t plunge ahead with something, it\u2019s like invading a place when you get a report that the enemy is all over the beaches and you didn\u2019t know it.\u201d\n\nFollow Jeff on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Jeff Poor", "description": "Former presidential says it's hard to envision when a president 'will attempt this great leap forward with government' again", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "On Monday\u2019s \u201cOn the Record,\u201d former Republican presidential adviser\u00a0Pat Buchanan said Obamacare is doing fundamental damage to President Obama, the Democratic Party and liberalism in general. t", "title": "Pat Buchanan: Obamacare \u2018destroying\u2019 the progressive philosophy of government", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2013/11/26/pat-buchanan-obamacare-destroying-the-progressive-philosophy-of-government/", "image": {"width": 630, "identifier": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Buchanan1125-e1385444107100.jpg", "height": 270}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "I don't know whenever again a president will attempt this great leap forward with government", "title": "Pat Buchanan: Obamacare \u2018destroying\u2019 the progressive philosophy of government Via @dailycaller", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2013/11/26/pat-buchanan-obamacare-destroying-the-progressive-philosophy-of-government/", "image": {"src": "http://dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Buchanan1125-e1385444107100.jpg"}, "creator": "@jeff_poor", "site": {"identifier": "@dailycaller", "id": 39308549}, "card": "summary"}, "sailthru.date": "2013-11-26 04:48:25", "sailthru.title": "Pat Buchanan: Obamacare 'destroying' the progressive philosophy of government", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "sailthru.tags": "obamacare,jeff-poor", "fb": {"app_id": 143489452702, "pages": 182919686769}, "keywords": "obamacare,pat buchanan", "sailthru.description": "On Monday\u2019s \u201cOn the Record,\u201d former Republican presidential adviser\u00a0Pat Buchanan said Obamacare is doing fundamental damage to President Obama, the Democratic Party and liberalism in general. t", "sailthru.image.full": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Buchanan1125-e1385444107100.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc1fa\"", "article_summary": "3987103On Monday\u2019s \u201cOn the Record,\u201d former Republican presidential adviser Pat Buchanan said Obamacare is doing fundamental damage to President Obama, the Democratic Party and liberalism in general.\n\u201cYou know, Barack Obama promised he was going to be a transformational president,\u201d Buchanan said.\nthe failures of Obamacare have done to the Barack Obama presidency, the Democratic Party and liberalism in general.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what they can do, Dana, because I think it\u2019s baked in the cake,\u201d Buchanan said.\n\u201cWell you know Dana, by now it\u2019s been two months, and as Churchill once said, the rubble is beginning to bounce,\u201d Buchanan continued."}
