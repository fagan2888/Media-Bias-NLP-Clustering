This not running-naked weather.

Nonetheless, Mike McConnell of the Daily Tribune Covered reports that a 25-year-old man, who appeared to be confused, was arrested and hospitalized after running naked along 12 Mile Road in Madison Heights on Tuesday afternoon around 1:45 p.m. Temperatures were in the low 20s.

Several motorist called police after spotting the man running west on 12 Mile near Stephenson Highway, the paper reported.

Detective Sgt. Mark Zupic told the paper that the man refused to get into the patrol car and kept running, saying he needed to get to where the sun was. He also said he was smoking marijuana.

The paper reported that officers struggled with the naked man before handcuffing him. He was taken for psychiatric observation.
