Medication and doctors\u2019 visits I was paying out of pocket.\u201d\n\nColorado occupies a unique place in transgender history. For a period between the 1970s and 1990s, the southern Colorado town of Trinidad became a destination for people seeking changes in their gender identities. Stanley Biber was one of the first surgeons to offer gender confirmation surgeries \u2013 prolonged, multi-step procedures that tempted patients to take up residency in the old coal-mining town. Locals welcomed the influx of business that came with being the so-called \u201csex change capital of the world.\u201d\n\nSuch tolerance, though, didn\u2019t extend beyond Trinidad\u2019s city limits. Transphobia and discrimination toward LGBT patients has long been and continues to be a problem almost everywhere else in Colorado and nationally.\n\nThings changed last March when the state Division of Insurance issued a bulletin prohibiting insurance companies from discriminating based on sexual orientation and gender identity. Although the bulletin isn\u2019t legally binding, it prompted two insurers, Kaiser Permanente and Anthem, to announce last fall that they would begin to include transgender care in Colorado.\n\nUnder its founding principle of non-discrimination, the one-year-old Colorado HealthOP never excluded trans patients. And now it seems to be pioneering the next step in inclusiveness for the LGBT community. Westfall said HealthOP is working on ways to help providers serve the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community with greater comfort and understanding, to make friendly offices.\n\n\u201cIf I have a cough, I don\u2019t want to be told it\u2019s because I\u2019m trans,\u201d said Leo Kattari, a social worker in Denver. \u201cWhat\u2019s really lacking is training and building capacity of providers in being more inclusive and more knowledgeable around their trans patients.\n\n\u201cThe number one thing carriers can do is training.\u201d\n\nKattari goes to providers that are trans-knowledgeable \u2013 meaning the entire staff knows to use a patient\u2019s preferred name and to acknowledge his or her preferred gender identity. Many in the community talk enough to one another to figure out which doctors are more trans friendly.\n\nA 2011 report and survey about healthcare by One Colorado, a gay- bisexual- and transgender-rights advocacy organization, showed many LGBT Coloradans had problems accessing informed and compassionate care, while others in the community hid their sexual or gender identities to make sure they\u2019d be treated with respect. One-fifth of those surveyed reported having been turned away by health-care providers.\n\n\u201cThere are far too many cases of LGBT Coloradans \u2013 particularly transgender Coloradans \u2013 who are simply trying to get the health care they need and are forced to deal with powerful barriers that others don\u2019t have to face,\u201d said Dave Montez, One Colorado\u2019s executive director. \u201cIt\u2019s time for all Coloradans to be visible and for our systems to reflect that.\u201d\n\nA 2013 report by One Colorado looked at how physicians interact with their LGBT patients. It found that while doctors often felt they treated all their patients equally, that \u201cis not exactly the right approach in the eyes of the LGBT community \u2013 one-third of whom are not confident that physicians are actually comfortable addressing their needs.\u201d\n\n\u201cCertainly, there is a gap,\u201d said Sheri Proctor, a trans woman in Boulder. \u201cWe\u2019re working really hard [as a community] to close that gap.\u201d\n\nWestfall aims for reform not just by his employer, Colorado HealthOP, but among all insurers in a state in which only three specifically cover trans healthcare.\n\n\u201cThis is not just about the Colorado HealthOP. This is about what can we do about moving the industry to be more supportive of the common and unique needs of the LGBTQQI community,\u201d he said.\n\nCrowe, who\u2019s now covered under HealthOP, is taking full advantage of her new benefits by planning a gender confirmation surgery later this year. Reform will mean finally feeling comfortable in her own skin.\n\n\u201cMaybe I\u2019m one of the few, maybe I\u2019m one of the only \u2014 but I\u2019m so glad for Obamacare because I would have never had the health care I\u2019m getting today,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve never ever been able to call and say: This is what I need, this is why I need it.\u201d\n\n[ Image by Farm4 ]", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Colorado Independent", "description": "Some Colorado insurers are working to deliver more enlightened health care  to the increasing number of transgender patients who now have coverage.", "title": "As more trans Coloradans land health coverage, insurers work to deliver better care", "url": "http://www.coloradoindependent.com/145887/as-more-trans-coloradans-land-health-coverage-insurers-work-to-deliver-better-care", "image": "http://coloradoindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/waiting-room.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "google-site-verification": "i2NY0iV2fHy9AAYv78ajpH43BN_IO8SUYAgP0XBcpQs", "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://coloradoindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/waiting-room.jpg?w=640"}, "site": "@COIndependent", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1", "article": {"published_time": "2014-02-07T17:30:44+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-02-07T17:37:25+00:00", "author": "http://www.coloradoindependent.com/author/shelby-kinney-lang"}}, "article_summary": "\u201cIt was a huge hole in my health care \u2013 specifically anything I needed.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s really lacking is training and building capacity of providers in being more inclusive and more knowledgeable around their trans patients.\nSome Colorado insurers are trying to promote compassion and inclusion in the way doctors and other medical professionals treat the influx of transgender patients seeking health care after years without coverage.\nUnder its founding principle of non-discrimination, the one-year-old Colorado HealthOP never excluded trans patients.\nAnd now it seems to be pioneering the next step in inclusiveness for the LGBT community."}
