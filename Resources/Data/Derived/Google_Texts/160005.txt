Most of the 700 people who went to see former President Jimmy Carter on Sunday weren’t old enough to vote when he lost his re-election bid in 1980. Some weren’t even born yet.

But that didn’t dampen their enthusiasm for meeting the man who now is better known for his post-presidency humanitarian work than his White House years.

“This was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to come and see him in person,” said Dr. Tarik Walker, 45, who works at Children’s Hospital Colorado. “He’s been a tremendous role model for me.”

Carter visited the Tattered Cover Book Store on East Colfax Avenue to promote his new book, “A Full Life: Reflections at 90,” a memoir looking back on a career of public and private service. After losing his bid for re-election, Carter dedicated his life to fighting for human rights and the eradication of diseases in the Third World. He won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2002.

“He’s one of the few ex-presidents that doesn’t just go out and play golf,” said Lisa Wulf, of Colorado Springs, who came to the event with her husband. “He’s one of our heroes.”

The Wulfs voted for Carter in both presidential elections.

Carter remained true to his reputation as a peacemaker, speaking briefly with reporters about President Barack Obama’s proposed deal to prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons. Carter severed diplomatic relations with Iran in 1980 after a violent takeover of the American embassy in 1979.

Carter praised the nuclear deal and said the time has come to reopen an embassy in Iran. “I’d like to see us have full relations with the Iranian people,” he said.

Such calls for peace have been controversial to some, but not to the waves of supporters Sunday.

“He’s just a very moral individual … not just in his presidency, but in his post-presidency,” said Brian Liberatore, 35. “He set the bar for the post-presidency.”
