There are 4,000 employees in 27 countries, including a significant presence at its U.S. hub in Plymouth.\n\nTurck, under U.S. CEO David Lagerstrom, has 570 local employees, an increase of about 200 people since 2012. The firm spent several million dollars on a 50,000-square-foot expansion of the Plymouth plant four years ago.\n\nKeysser said Turck, in addition to its manufacturing prowess and growth, was recognized for a \u201cstrong skills-training component, an exceptionally low employee turnover rate, an onsite health clinic in partnership with HealthPartners, and a focus on environmentally friendly manufacturing and recycling processes.\u201d\n\nThe German American chamber presented the award to Lagerstrom at a dinner Saturday night.\n\nNEAL ST. ANTHONY\n\nHealth CARE\n\nEmployers don\u2019t back away from Obamacare\n\nThe federal Affordable Care Act includes penalties for large employers that don\u2019t offer quality health insurance coverage.\n\nSo, passage of the law raised what came to be known as the \u201cpay-or-play\u201d question.\n\nWould employers simply \u201cpay\u201d the fine and opt out? Or would they continue to \u201cplay\u201d the health insurance game?\n\nA report this month from the consulting firm Mercer is the latest to suggest the answer for most is: play.\n\nIn a write-up of its annual survey of employer-sponsored health plans, Mercer said that survey results have consistently shown a commitment by large employers to keep offering health insurance benefits. It was a different story with small employers, but Mercer says even that is starting to change.\n\n\u201cOnly 7 percent of employers with 50-499 employees now say they are likely to drop their plans within the next five years, down from 21 percent in 2013,\u201d the report states. \u201cAmong employers with 500 or more employees, just 5 percent say they are likely to drop their plans, essentially unchanged from 4 percent in 2014.\u201d\n\nCHRISTOPHER SNOWBECK\n\nMinority hiring\n\nSeward Co-op recognized as diverse employer\n\nForty-four-year-old Seward Community Co-op was named employer of the year by the nonprofit job placement agency HIRED. Seward is lauded for its success in recruiting a workforce for its new south Minneapolis grocery store that is nearly two-thirds people of color.\n\nThe co-op\u2019s Friendship Store, which is exceeding sales expectations after opening last fall at E. 38th Street and 3rd Avenue S. in a job-hungry neighborhood that lacked a grocery store, boasts 93 workers, 63 percent of whom are Latinos, blacks and other minorities. The goal was one-third employees of color by 2018.\n\nCo-op marketing manager Tom Vogel said the store couldn\u2019t have done it without HIRED\u2019s help. HIRED trains dislocated and other skills-lacking workers for jobs in manufacturing, retail and office work.\n\nSeward staffers started an intense project last year to not only bring healthy foods to the neighborhood, but also to address food pricing and neighborhood hiring and to make sure that its staff and ownership reflected the composition of its new neighborhood. Today, the store has 1,700 new \u201cowners,\u201d who buy membership shares in the co-op.\n\nJobs at the new store, which cost nearly $15 million to develop and build, pay a minimum of $12.82 per hour plus some benefits.\n\nOverall, the co-op, based on E. Franklin Avenue about 3 miles away, has nearly 400 employees in its several businesses, more than a third of whom are minorities.\n\nDee DePass\n\nOn to Washington\n\nDeAnna Cummings builds art, economy\n\nFor 20-plus years, CEO DeAnna Dodds Cummings, co-founder of Juxtaposition Arts on lower W. Broadway in north Minneapolis, has proved that art also is good economic development. Her growing enterprise restored what is now four once-dilapidated buildings that employ 100 full- and part-time artists and other workers and that engage 1,800 young people in arts education and projects annually.\n\nCummings, who earned a master\u2019s degree from Harvard University, has been selected to be a fellow at the DeVos Institute of Arts Management in Washington, D.C., one of 13 executives from six countries chosen from more than 450 applicants.\n\nUnder Cummings, Juxtaposition Arts shifted from an after-school enrichment model to a social enterprise that trains and employs young people as a springboard to higher education and careers in art and design.\n\nNEAL ST.
