Rep. Steve Stockman is doing a great job drawing attention to himself. But he isn’t doing conservatives any favors in his bid to unseat Sen. John Cornyn in the March primary.

If there’s a debate to be had on whether Cornyn is conservative enough, Stockman isn’t the guy to lead it. So far, his run for Senate rests largely on bogus allegations (“Cornyn loves Obamacare”), ridiculous distortions (Cornyn supports “Obama’s lifetime gun ban”) and stunts (walking out of the State of the Union address).

The Republican Party needs a debate right now about its future. Cornyn’s campaign for reelection is a great opportunity to have it. But Stockman is draining away the possibility that will happen in a serious way.

Today, Todd Gillman reported that Ken Cope, one of the other seven people running to unseat Cornyn, called for Stockman to get out the race. Stockman’s antics embarrassing and damaging to the Republican Party, he said.

Cope’s right. The more the far right gives credence to the Stockmans of the world, the farther conservatives are going to find themselves from power.

Voters are capable of deciding in March what they think of Stockman’s ideas. And Stockman is certain to give them that chance. But when a candidate actually subtracts from the quality of the race, it’s best if he’d just go.
