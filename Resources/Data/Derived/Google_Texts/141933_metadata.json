I learned that the new pair of Sambas I'd been eyeing counted as a want but tennis shoes counted as a need since I traveled for tennis tournaments every weekend.\n\nAt first I was guided by my dad and his definitions of wants and needs, but eventually I formulated my own definitions. I noticed that the chocolate-milk column grew exponentially quicker than the water column \u2014 luckily for childhood me, I knew not to dare touch the want column.\n\nSure, it was helpful to develop this frugal lifestyle centered around \"need buying\" as a high schooler and college student, but my dad's lesson has become more valuable than ever upon entering the real world, where to stay afloat with minimal income in an expensive city like New York you have to distinguish between needs and wants.\n\nWhat this distinction does is it makes you a diligent and conscious spender, a habit that takes time to form \u2014 a habit that a personal-finance book or class can define but never truly teach.\n\nThat 1997 chocolate-milk lesson looms over every purchase I make. I first determine whether I'm buying a want or a need, and, if it's a want, I weigh the pros and cons before mindlessly spending.\n\nOf course there's always a time and place for a chocolate milk \u2014 the occasional splurge keeps you sane \u2014 but for the most part, I'll be the one with the glass of water.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#185f7c", "sailthru.author": "Kathleen Elkins", "application-name": "Business Insider", "twitter": {"description": "I was a kindergartner who really wanted chocolate milk at the local diner.", "creator": "kathleen_elk", "url": "http://www.businessinsider.com/wants-versus-needs-2015-11", "image": "http://static6.businessinsider.com/image/56560cdbeab8ea94422e31fc-506-253/when-i-was-6-my-dad-taught-me-a-critical-money-lesson-that-forever-changed-the-way-i-spend.jpg", "title": "When I was 6, my dad taught me a critical money lesson that forever changed the way I spend", "site": "BIYourMoney", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.verticals": "yourmoney", "linkedin": {"owner": "mid:1d5f7b"}, "sailthru.tags": "Spending, Saving, Money Management, Psychology Of Money, Smart Investor, Kathleen Elkins", "description": "I was a kindergartner who really wanted chocolate milk at the local diner.", "author": "Kathleen Elkins", "sailthru.date": "2015-11-30", "sailthru.title": "When I was 6, my dad taught me a critical money lesson that forever changed the way I spend", "theme-color": "#185f7c", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://static2.businessinsider.com/image/56560c7becad04ff07414a22-50-50/when-i-was-6-my-dad-taught-me-a-critical-money-lesson-that-forever-changed-the-way-i-spend.jpg", "news_keywords": "Spending, Saving, Money Management, Psychology Of Money, Smart Investor, Kathleen Elkins", "tbi-image": "http://static3.businessinsider.com/image/56560c7becad04ff07414a22/when-i-was-6-my-dad-taught-me-a-critical-money-lesson-that-forever-changed-the-way-i-spend.jpg", "fb": {"app_id": 155043519637}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://static1.businessinsider.com/assets/images/us/favicons/mstile-144x144.png?v=BI-US-2016-03-31", "date": "2015-11-30", "article": {"publisher": "businessinsider", "author": "http://www.businessinsider.com/author/kathleen-elkins"}, "sailthru.description": "I was a kindergartner who really wanted chocolate milk at the local diner.", "viewport": "width=1024", "og": {"site_name": "Business Insider", "description": "I was a kindergartner who really wanted chocolate milk at the local diner.", "title": "When I was 6, my dad taught me a critical money lesson that forever changed the way I spend", "url": "http://www.businessinsider.com/wants-versus-needs-2015-11", "image": "http://static1.businessinsider.com/image/56560cdbeab8ea94422e31fc-1190-625/when-i-was-6-my-dad-taught-me-a-critical-money-lesson-that-forever-changed-the-way-i-spend.jpg", "type": "article"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Business Insider", "title": "When I was 6, my dad taught me a critical money lesson that forever changed the way I spend", "sailthru.image.full": "http://static3.businessinsider.com/image/56560c7becad04ff07414a22/when-i-was-6-my-dad-taught-me-a-critical-money-lesson-that-forever-changed-the-way-i-spend.jpg", "tbi-vertical": "yourmoney"}, "article_summary": "I was a kindergartner who really wanted chocolate milk at the Soda Shop, a local diner in my hometown of Davidson, North Carolina.\nThe speech went over my 6-year-old head, but the conclusion of the message stuck \u2014 never ask for chocolate milk at a restaurant.\nI learned that afternoon that chocolate milk qualifies as a want and water as a need.\nOf course there's always a time and place for a chocolate milk \u2014 the occasional splurge keeps you sane \u2014 but for the most part, I'll be the one with the glass of water.\nAt first I was guided by my dad and his definitions of wants and needs, but eventually I formulated my own definitions."}
