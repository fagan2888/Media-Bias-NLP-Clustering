Anyone watching the debates from Africa, particularly those in multiparty \u201cdemocratic\u201d states must have been reminded of general elections in their respective countries where seven or more candidates usually contest the presidency.\n\nKenya\u2019s 2013 presidential election featured eight hopefuls and earlier this year, Zambia\u2019s hotly contested January 20 election following the death of the country\u2019s former president Michael Sata, had 11 candidates.\n\nZambia\u2019s president Edgar Lungu after he was elected early in the year in a race that had 11 candidates.

(Photo/AFP).\n\nIn fact, Trump who is still enjoying the status of the Republican frontrunner, initially declined to pledge allegiance to the party, saying he wouldn\u2019t rule out running as an independent in case he didn\u2019t secure the nomination.\n\nHe only caved weeks later, promising to support the eventual nominee, although knowing the kind of character he is, no one should be surprised if he went back on his word if he loses the nomination.\n\nThird term issue\n\nThe other apparent change in American politics is the increased usage of the phrase \u201cthird term\u201d; after all, there were quite a few Americans who seriously wanted the country\u2019s 40th president, Ronald Reagan (1981 to 1989), to hang on.\n\nTo be fair, it has always been used, often as a jab at prospective candidates from the same party as at the outgoing president. Hillary Clinton, the Democrat frontrunner has laboured to explain that getting elected would not be an extension of her husband Bill Clinton or Barack Obama\u2019s rule after Republicans put out adverts urging their supporters and the country at large not to hand Democrats a third term.\n\nYou get the sense that pretty soon, voters may embrace the concept of an actual third term. Back in July, while addressing African Union delegates during his two-day trip to Ethiopia, President Obama joked that he just might win if the constitution allowed him to run for a third term.\n\nA few days later, Fox News, a conservative-leaning news network conducted a poll among likely voters on Obama\u2019s electability were he to run for a third term. It found that 30% of those polled said they would support him!\n\nThat means that with a few well placed campaign adverts and his galvanising speeches, and that figure would surely rise. With nearly all Republican contenders vowing to repel several of his policies and key legislations including the Iran nuclear deal and his signature Affordable Healthcare Act which they disdainfully termed Obamacare \u201con their first day in office\u201d, maybe Obama will finally understand why the African strongmen he chided for clinging for power want to remain president for life.\n\nPresidents for life\n\nOne of the excuses many African leaders give for hanging onto office is that they want to \u201cfinish\u201d the job.\n\nFuture American presidents may start using it too, given their country\u2019s often obstructive politics and gridlock that don\u2019t allow much to get done.\n\nTypically, an American president is too cagey during his first term because he doesn\u2019t want to jeopardise his chances of reelection. He\u2019s also constrained by members of his party, usually senators and governors who have their own elections down the road to worry about.\n\nMid-term elections are held every two years for Members of Congress and this curtails the incumbent\u2019s freedom to implement his agenda and, in the end, he fails to keep many of his campaign promises.\n\nFor instance in September 2014, following pressure from Democrats worried about losing their seats Obama, who had earlier on promised to take executive action on Immigration Reform after Congress failed to resolve the immigration crisis, announced that he would delay any action till after that year\u2019s mid-terms.\n\nThis was the same president who had swept the Latino vote in both 2008 and 2012 with 67% and 71% respectively after pledging to oversee immigration reform (an issue that impacts mostly Latinos), and here he was taking a step back. Hispanics were not impressed and although he eventually extended temporary legal status to at least 5 million illegal immigrants, the damage had already been done.\n\nDemocrats had lost the House of Representatives and the president has had to work with an opposition-led Congress since.\n\nSo, even when a president does win a second term, he still doesn\u2019t get his way all the time because while he has nothing to lose as his tenure draws to a close, his party colleagues seeking reelection do.\n\nExtended term limits for the American president would take care of that. For America, it\u2019s not a question of if but when, they will embrace change.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Americans are headed for multiparty politics and third terms - they just don\u2019t know it yet", "og": {"site_name": "MG Africa", "description": "The bickering among Republican Party contenders is typical of what happens among the opposition in many African countries.", "title": "Americans are headed for multiparty politics and third terms - they just don\u2019t know it yet", "url": "http://mgafrica.com/article/2015-09-27-americans-are-headed-for-multiparty-politics-and-third-terms-they-just-dont-know-it-yet/", "image": "http://cdn.mg.co.za/crop/content/images/2015/09/27/republicandebate_landscape.jpg/600x250/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The bickering among Republican Party contenders is typical of what happens among the opposition in many African countries.", "creator": "@MandGAfrica", "image": {"src": "http://cdn.mg.co.za/crop/content/images/2015/09/27/republicandebate_landscape.jpg/600x250/"}, "title": "Americans are headed for multiparty politics and third terms - they just don\u2019t know it yet", "site": "@MandGAfrica", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"admins": 800545203}, "keywords": "African President Third Term, Presidents For Life,  Term Limits, Barack Obama, Republican Party, US Politics,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-09-27 16:20:00", "modified_time": "2015-09-27 16:20:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, minimum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf252\"", "article_summary": "Typically, an American president is too cagey during his first term because he doesn\u2019t want to jeopardise his chances of reelection.\nExtended term limits for the American president would take care of that.\nFuture American presidents may start using it too, given their country\u2019s often obstructive politics and gridlock that don\u2019t allow much to get done.\nWhile independents or third party candidates aren\u2019t barred from running for president, the race is really down to Democrats and Republicans, but that could change in the near future.\nZambia\u2019s president Edgar Lungu after he was elected early in the year in a race that had 11 candidates."}
