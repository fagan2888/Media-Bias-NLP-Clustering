Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut claimed that America’s middle electorate is “sick and tired of Republicans” fighting against the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, during a Thursday interview with MSNBC’s Tamron Hall.

Murphy stated that hopefully, in the wake of the Supreme Court’s King v. Burwell ruling, Republicans will give up the debate and start concentrating on “more important things.” (RELATED: SCOTUS Upholds All Obamacare Subsidies In Win For Obama)

MURPHY: My hope is that this puts this debate to rest. …

The polls are showing that the American people now have bought into it, the benefits have accrued to literally tens of millions people, and there’s just more important things that we should be talking about than this continuing obsession with repealing the act. …

I don’t think that it’s unexpected that Republicans say today that the battle is not over, but what’s going to then happen is their strategists are going to sit down, look at where the middle of the electorate is and decide as to whether or not it makes sense to pursue this. The reality is that the middle of the electorate increasingly is more and more comfortable with the Affordable Care Act, and they’re sick and tired of Republicans using Washington to just grind this ideological axe.

So today they’re going to say that the fight isn’t over, but once they sit down together in the next few weeks they might have a different take on this.
