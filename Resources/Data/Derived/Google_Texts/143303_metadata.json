Dermatologists, plastic surgeons and medical spa owners can come test refurbished cosmetic lasers from various manufacturers prior to purchase. In addition to significant savings in repair costs, doctors and spa owners can now add new cosmetic laser treatments at a fraction of the cost manufacturers charge.\n\nThe company is very confident that the affordable cosmetic lasers will allow doctors and spa owners to generate more income by offering cash procedures. This has become more important to doctors with the implementation of the Affordable Health Care Act.\n\n\u201cWe found the cost of new machines was significantly impacting doctors' and spa owners' ability to be profitable on their investment. We believe offering preowned equipment which provides patients the same great results, with lower upfront costs, will help doctors overcome the hurdle set forth by ObamaCare\u201d said Ari Marom, the director of sales at NY Laser Outlet.\n\n\u201cI have worked with Ari in purchasing a laser. He is extremely trustworthy and honest. I would recommend him and NY Laser Outlet to any physician in need of fixing, renting or buying a good used laser product.\u201d says Dr. Bodian, a successful dermatologist and medical day spa owner who has been working with NY Laser Outlet since they launched.\n\nA list of the manufacturers and equipment NY Laser Outlet has available for viewing in the showroom can be seen by visiting http://www.nylaseroutlet.com/buy-cosmetic-laser-ipl.\n\nMauro C. Romita MD, plastic surgeon and founder of Ajune: The Center of Beauty Synergy, located at 835 5th Avenue, was shocked by the savings NY Laser Outlet was able to provide him: \u201cBy means of his diligent effort and relationships in the industry, he correctly detected the problem, took the laser and returned it in less time than anticipated. He not only warranted his work but saved me over $17,000 from the laser manufacturer\u2019s quote. He is honest and available, truly a rare find in the medical technology industry. I endorse him with the highest recommendation.\u201d Mauro Romita is a regular in New York Magazine\u2019s annual listing of \u201cBest Doctors in New York.\u201d\n\nNY Laser Outlet offers cosmetic laser rentals as well.
