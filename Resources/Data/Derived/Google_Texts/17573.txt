Dear Abby: My wife and I will be legally divorced within a few weeks. We have a year-old son. Although we have been separated for eight months, she is an awesome mother to our son. A man could not ask for a better lady to care for his child. We don’t talk about much other than our son. We are no longer in love, but I can honestly say I love her for who she is — the mother of my child.
