At the same time, a new federal requirement will kick in that mandates most Americans must have health insurance or face fines.\n\nLouisiana\u2019s health insurance marketplace will be run by the federal government under a decision made by Gov. Bobby Jindal, but the marketplace has some oversight from Insurance Commissioner Jim Donelon\u2019s Department of Insurance.\n\nDonelon said the insurance choices and subsidies available are so complicated that he expects it will be difficult for people to navigate and for accountants to work through the tax credits involved.\n\n\u201cThe complexity of it is mind-boggling,\u201d Donelon, a Republican who opposed the federal health care law, told the Press Club of Baton Rouge.\n\nThe insurance department has posted information on its website and has a consumer assistance office that will answer questions as the insurance enrollment period opens and continues through March 31.\n\nDonelon said his department also will be doing various outreach efforts to provide information about the marketplace and insurance options.\n\nIn addition, four organizations in Louisiana are splitting $1.8 million in federal \u201cnavigator\u201d grants to help with education and enrollment across the state.\n\nCompanies that are offering health insurance plans through the exchange also will advertise them, insurance agents will have information and federally-qualified health centers around the state will be helping with enrollment. Organizations that help eligible people sign up for Medicaid and Medicare also will be providing information.\n\nTwo companies plan to sell insurance plans statewide through Louisiana\u2019s exchange: Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Louisiana and the Louisiana Health Cooperative, a nonprofit that Donelon said is still working to begin its operations.\n\nVantage Insurance will offer plans on the marketplace in many Louisiana parishes, while Humana will do so only in Jefferson Parish, according to Donelon.\n\nThe insurance commissioner said he\u2019s pleased with the participation in Louisiana\u2019s health insurance marketplace and believes it will offer people options, depending on how much they want to pay and what they want covered.\n\n\u201cWe have enough to meet all the demand,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said, however, that some people likely still wouldn\u2019t be able to afford coverage even with the federal subsidies and could face penalties, up to $95 per uninsured individual in 2014.\n\nOnline: Insurance department information on the Affordable Care Act \u2013 http://www.ldi.state.la.us/HealthCareReform.html\n\nCopyright 2016 Associated Press.
