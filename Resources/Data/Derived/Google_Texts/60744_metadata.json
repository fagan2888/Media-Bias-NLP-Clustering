Tom Wiens.\n\nWiens is attempting to foreclose on the Boulder County mining properties, claiming that Hendricks and partners in Calais Resources Inc. defaulted on $15 million in loans.\n\nAt stake is a trove of gold that Hendricks estimates could be as much as 15 million ounces, worth nearly $19 billion at current prices.\n\nThe legal battle is unfolding during an interesting period for gold mining in Colorado. Prices are high enough \u2014 about $1,250 an ounce \u2014 that several owners of mining claims are seeking to relaunch production in areas that first were developed in the gold rush of the 1860s.\n\nBut strict and expensive regulatory requirements, combined with wariness by prospective lenders and investors, have made it difficult to get the historic claims back into production.\n\nThe Caribou and Cross mines, operated by Calais Resources, are prime examples of the gap between eye-popping potential and capital-constrained reality.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCapital, claims, counterclaims\n\nEven as ownership of the properties lies in legal limbo, Hendricks, 64, dons a pair of Carhartt overalls and drives each day up a rutted dirt road to maintain the mines, whose last major production was in 1988.\n\nSince then, he and David Young \u2014 officers of Calais Resources \u2014 have extensively explored their 500 acres of claims. They've drilled hundreds of core samples and discovered dozens of promising new ore veins.\n\nYet one crucial requirement \u2014 operating capital \u2014 has kept them from restarting the mines and posting profits.\n\nCalais Resources was created as a publicly owned company, but in 2012 the Securities and Exchange Commission revoked the firm's registration for a recurring pattern of failing to file financial reports. Calais told regulators that the reports weren't filed because the company couldn't afford to pay its auditor.\n\nAn apparent breakthrough occurred later in 2012 when a group that included Wiens spent $6 million to purchase promissory notes representing loans made to Calais over the past decade. The notes gave the Wiens group the right to collect principal and interest payments from Calais.\n\nWiens, 61, served as a Republican state legislator in Colorado from 2003 to 2009. He owns a Douglas County ranch and operates a financial-services firm, New West Capital.\n\nWiens saw the Calais promissory notes not just as a financial instrument but as a mechanism to get involved in the quest for gold.\n\nHe and the mine partners launched a series of discussions about creating a partnership in which Wiens' group would provide the funds needed to get the mines up and running again.\n\nCalais says Wiens agreed to make an initial payment of $930,000 to pay off some of Calais' debts, then invest more to make the mines operational.\n\nMonths later, the talks turned confrontational under claims by both sides of fraud and misdealing.\n\nWiens' investment partnership, New West Minerals LLC, said the loans were in default and demanded full payment from Calais. When payment wasn't made, New West filed suit in Boulder District Court to foreclose on the mine property.\n\nIn addition, New West filed a lawsuit in Douglas County District Court, alleging that Hendricks and Young of Calais and their Boulder attorney, John Henderson, engaged in \"self-dealings and intentional misrepresentations\" to the detriment of New West.\n\nCalais and related parties have filed counterclaims in both cases, claiming that it was Wiens who acted in bad faith.\n\nHendricks said he feels personally attacked by the suits and is concerned that they portray him in a bad light, contrary to the reputation he has established over decades of work and community involvement. His r\u00e9sum\u00e9 contains a long list of civic awards and recognition.\n\nHe describes the legal dispute as \"Wiens' effort to steal my life's work.\"\n\n\"I've spent more than 40 years responsibly developing the mining property in the Caribou District in a manner that respects the environment and the surrounding community,\" Hendricks said. \"I've encountered countless obstacles in that time, though perhaps none bigger than someone who presented themselves as a partner turning out to be a predator intent on snatching it up.\"\n\nWiens replied that New West filed the foreclosure suit \"long after Calais had gone over the cliff to financial ruin.\"\n\n\"Calais' problems have been well documented and continuing for many years,\" Wiens said. \"It is unfortunate that Mr. Hendricks feels the way he does, but this situation is a result of a series of plans gone bad over a long period of time, resulting in bad outcomes for Calais' creditors and shareholders.\"\n\nLike Calais, Wiens has endured his share of financial problems. Companies that Wiens has headed, including Recycling Industries and InteleCom, have filed for bankruptcy. Wiens also once filed for personal bankruptcy protection.\n\nThe \"lost notes\"\n\nThe outcome of the mines' ownership is likely to hinge on one key legal question.\n\nWiens' lawsuits state that he legally acquired four Calais promissory notes in a series of purchases. But he has acknowledged in related hearings that he does not physically possess three of the notes. Case filings refer to them as the \"lost notes.\"\n\nCalais argues that promissory notes are negotiable instruments, and as with personal checks, a presumed owner must have physical possession of the original documents, not just copies.\n\nWiens' attorneys claim that his ownership of the notes is clearly established and that physical possession is not required.\n\nCalais has filed a motion to dismiss the case based on the possession issue. A ruling is expected this year.\n\nCalais' legal fees are being paid by unidentified investors who will acquire a stake in Calais if the company wins in court, said Calais attorney Tarek Saad of Patton Boggs.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/boulder-business/ci_25095195/boulder-county-gold-mines-play-after-dispute-between", "sailthru.author": "By Steve Raabe \n \n  The Denver Post", "ag": {"canon": "BoulderDailyCamera:article:25095195:view"}, "startDate": "2014-02-09T21:15:34-0700", "twitter": {"domain": "dailycamera.com", "description": "A pair of historic gold mines possibly worth billions face a clouded future after a flurry of lawsuits that pit an old-school prospector against a former state legislator.", "title": "Boulder County gold mines in play after dispute between prospector, investor", "url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/boulder-business/ci_25095195/boulder-county-gold-mines-play-after-dispute-between", "site": "@dailycamera", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "sailthru.section": "Boulder County Business", "modificationDate": "2014-02-10T01:12:05-0700", "endDate": "2024-02-08T17:56:18-0700", "news_keywords": "Boulder business news, Boulder Colorado, technology news, real estate, Boulder real estate, boulder business people, breaking business news, boulder, colorado, business, news,", "byline": "By Steve RaabeThe", "pubDate": "2014-02-09T21:16:17-0700", "sailthru.date": "2014-02-09T21:15:34-0700", "sailthru.title": "Boulder County gold mines in play after dispute between prospector, investor", "verify-v1": "TakAiHiDAOiNOP+m0YTx4DQeyjor+bTdc8e+pw6bDoI=", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site21/2014/0208/20140208__10dcbcov~2_300.jpg", "description": "A pair of historic gold mines possibly worth billions face a clouded future after a flurry of lawsuits that pit an old-school prospector against a former state legislator.", "sailthru.site": "dailycamera.com", "msvalidate.01": "9DAB14005AD5A9FFA4CA0EF58CC794BA", "og": {"url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/boulder-business/ci_25095195/boulder-county-gold-mines-play-after-dispute-between", "image": "http://extras.dailycamera.com/images/dailycamera3.png", "type": "article", "description": "A pair of historic gold mines possibly worth billions face a clouded future after a flurry of lawsuits that pit an old-school prospector against a former state legislator.", "title": "Boulder County gold mines in play after dispute between prospector, investor"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "867892b0357001538903740c75a206f0"}, "google-site-verification": "07CC1xPDVU0znu496XTAjLyC32Ylj8zwWHlmrzx3pgY", "y_key": "c9d9b53f7f5af674", "sailthru.image.full": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site21/2014/0208/20140208__10dcbcov~2.jpg"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc537\"", "article_summary": "When payment wasn't made, New West filed suit in Boulder District Court to foreclose on the mine property.\nTom Hendricks, known as \"Miner Tom\" among locals, has worked the Caribou District gold mines almost every day for more than 40 years.\nClick photo to enlarge \u00ab123\u00bbNEDERLAND \u2014 A pair of historic gold mines possibly worth billions face a clouded future after a flurry of lawsuits that pit an old-school prospector against a former state legislator.\nCalais' legal fees are being paid by unidentified investors who will acquire a stake in Calais if the company wins in court, said Calais attorney Tarek Saad of Patton Boggs.\nWiens replied that New West filed the foreclosure suit \"long after Calais had gone over the cliff to financial ruin.\""}
