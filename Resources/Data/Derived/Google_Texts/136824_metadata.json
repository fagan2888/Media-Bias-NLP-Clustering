The new sneaker, dubbed Chuck II, features better shock absorption, a padded non-slip tongue, micro-suede lining, and a sturdier canvas made of Tencel, a high-tech fabric made from wood pulp.\n\nThe Converse Rubber Shoe Company made the first All Stars in 1917. The simple cotton and rubber sneakers were originally aimed at serious athletes playing soccer and netball, an early version of basketball. By the 1960s, about 90 percent of college and professional basketball players wore All Stars, and the sneakers accounted for 80 percent of the consumer sneaker market.\n\nFor decades, the sneakers were a counterculture fashion statement, popular with musicians, artists, and writers. Rockers like the Ramones and Kurt Cobain wore them, along with writers like Hunter S. Thompson. The brand was adopted by skateboarders in the\u2019 70s, adding to its street cred. The Rolling Stones made Chuck Taylors the official sneaker of their Steel Wheels Tour in 1989.\n\nRelated Link: How Michael Jordan Made His $1 Billion\n\nConverse has sold more than a billion pairs of Chucks.
