Once that's been done, the county will know how much is left in the program's fund and can determine how to use that money.\n\nApproved by voters in 2004, CHOICES let uninsured workers receive primary care from physicians as well as vision, dental and pharmaceutical services, although it doesn't cover hospitalizations.\n\nOver its lifetime, the program served about 9,500 residents directly as enrollees. But it helped more residents indirectly by giving funding to area organizations like the ACORN Clinic and the UF mobile outreach clinic to boost their operations and allow them to serve more people.\n\nCHOICES also developed a wellness program that included Zumba and other free fitness classes as well as activities aimed at combating childhood obesity, among other health problems, for any interested county residents.\n\n\"I think for the citizens of Alachua County, especially enrollees, that CHOICES has been in some ways a lifesaver,\" Nixon said. \"It gave them access to affordable health care that otherwise they would not be able to have.\"\n\nCommunity Support Services Director Minnie Rolark said she's heard so many stories of how CHOICES helped its participants.\n\nOne woman had a lump in her breast that turned out to be breast cancer. Without CHOICES, she wouldn't have been able to go to a doctor to get checked out and they wouldn't have caught the cancer early, Rolark said.\n\nA man was able to get dentures that helped him land a decent job, Rolark said. Getting jobs had been hard without teeth in the front of his mouth.\n\n\"Those are success stories, and there's hundreds and thousands of them,\" Rolark said.\n\nMany CHOICES enrollees had one or more of the \"Big Four\" \u2014 asthma, high blood pressure, diabetes and heart disease \u2014 and were able to manage those medical issues through the program.\n\nFlorida legislators' decision not to expand Medicaid has left a big hole in coverage for residents losing the support they got from CHOICES, Rolark said.\n\nBut the CHOICES Advisory Board is looking at how best to fill that void in the future, mulling over potential successors to the soon-to-be-retired program.\n\nDr. Allan March, a retired physician who is chair of the advisory board, said he and his fellow board members are evaluating their options.\n\nAlthough March and the rest of the board don't know what form a new health program might take, he said they do know it is important to design a successor to CHOICES that will help residents access affordable health services.\n\n\"It's not going to be CHOICES. It's going to be something different,\" he said. \"We have a history of success here in Alachua County and we know we can do something positive, so I think we're going to try to move forward on this.\"\n\nThe successor to CHOICES, if the advisory board is able to drum up support for its forthcoming proposal, will likely focus once again on helping low-income workers and the people who fall into the insurance coverage gap between Medicaid and what's available through employer insurance programs.\n\n\"The health care insurance climate has been changing rapidly, and not always in the direction that is favorable to our underserved and medically needy in Alachua County,\" March said. \"So it's been hard to predict exactly what the needs will be until we see how the Affordable Care Act is implemented or what its shortcomings in implementation might appear to be.\"\n\nThe dental care offered by CHOICES was well-received by the community and may be worth incorporating into a new proposal, as would CHOICES' history of supporting innovative endeavors like the FluMist program, which provides flu vaccines for local children and thus raises the community's overall immunization level, March said.\n\nThe advisory board may recommend that the county emulate some of the things CHOICES succeeded at, but March wants to draw up a plan that improves upon the program's weaknesses as well.\n\nCHOICES was criticized for its extremely slow start in attracting enrollees. With CHOICES' potential successor, March said it would be beneficial for a smoother, faster transition to getting the program up and running.\n\nThe question of how to fund a new program is still uncertain, March said, as are the specifics of how it would operate. Voters may be willing to adopt another quarter-cent sales tax, as they did with CHOICES in 2004, but the advisory board is considering possible state funding or other alternatives as well.\n\n\"We have to do this in an organized way, and for that reason we will be drawing up a plan,\" March said.\n\nContact Morgan Watkins at 338-3104 or morgan.watkins@gainesville.com.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Since Alachua County's CHOICES program kicked off in October 2005, it has helped about 9,500 employed-but-uninsured residents gain access to affordable health care.", "vf": {"unique_id": "art-83E2567D-D9C7-42D0-81D1-C4FA5E2359D4-pubGS"}, "og": {"site_name": "Gainesville.com", "description": "Since Alachua County's CHOICES program kicked off in October 2005, it has helped about 9,500 employed-but-uninsured residents gain access to affordable health care.", "title": "Scramble happening locally as CHOICES ends, ACA begins", "url": "http://www.gainesville.com/article/20131226/articles/131229752", "image": {"width": 160, "identifier": "http://www.gainesville.com/global/images/fb/GS.png", "type": "image/png", "height": 160}, "type": "article"}, "publishdate": 20131226, "fb": {"admins": 100001603422190, "app_id": 191331304228818}, "tout": {"article": {"id": "art-131229752-pubGS"}}, "keywords": "GAINESVILLE (FL),  Special Report,  Article"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1f8a\"", "article_summary": "Since Alachua County's CHOICES program kicked off in October 2005, it has helped about 9,500 employed-but-uninsured residents gain access to affordable health care.\n\"Unfortunately, as with a lot of Americans, some of them will not have access to health insurance,\" she said.\nCHOICES is closing down on Dec. 31, after which the 4,382 people enrolled will need to find another source of health care, Acting CHOICES Director Candie Nixon said.\n\"It gave them access to affordable health care that otherwise they would not be able to have.\"\n\"I think for the citizens of Alachua County, especially enrollees, that CHOICES has been in some ways a lifesaver,\" Nixon said."}
