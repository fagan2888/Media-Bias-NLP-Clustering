The plans offer more coverage. ... The question is do people want that coverage\" that is mandated?\n\n\n\nUnder Obamacare, health insurance policies renewed in 2014 must comply with at least the 10 essential health benefits, including mental health, rehabilitation and prescription drugs.\n\n\n\nSome customers have been offered early renewal options for 2014 to lock in plans from 2013 that in some cases are priced only slightly higher.\n\n\n\nBut thousands of other customers have had their current policies canceled \u2014 told by insurers their plans are not compliant with Obamacare for 2014 \u2014 and given new plan choices that are generally richer because of the essential benefits but more expensive.\n\n\n\nMike Embry, senior account director at Comerica Insurance Services Inc. in Detroit, said health insurers appear to be pricing their products fairly based on competitive pressures and additional costs they expect for 2014.\n\n\n\n\"The more you give in benefits, the more expensive it will be. You can't add benefits to a program without adding to the costs,\" said Embry, noting that 75 percent of his small-business customers are paying much higher rates than they have in the recent past.\n\n\n\nSteve Miller, account executive with Grand Rapids-based Mills Benefits Group, said small groups of all sizes are paying more. Less than 10 percent of his groups have received lower rates, he said.\n\n\n\n\"The overall average is higher this year, and the dollar amount of increase is much higher for all groups,\" Miller said.\n\n\n\nBuhs said the state insurance department is receiving a high volume of questions and complaints about having coverage discontinued and rates being increased.\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "Southeast Michigan's health insurers, including Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan, Priority Health, HealthPlus and Health Alliance Plan, have told customers that rate increases next year are driven by a combination of regular medical cost trends along with new taxes, coverage of pre-existing\u00a0\u2026", "og": {"site_name": "Crain's Detroit Business", "description": "Southeast Michigan's health insurers, including Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan, Priority Health, HealthPlus and Health Alliance Plan, have told customers that rate increases next year are driven by a combination of regular medical cost trends along with new taxes, coverage of pre-existing\u00a0\u2026", "title": "Health insurance rates rising", "url": "http://www.crainsdetroit.com/article/20131027/NEWS/310279984/health-insurance-rates-rising", "image": "http://www.crainsdetroit.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/CD/20131027/NEWS/310279984/V2/0/Caleb_Buhs.jpg&MaxW=1400&MaxH=1400", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@crainsdetroit", "card": "summary", "account_id": 29209404}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#b51218", "fb": {"app_id": 112806662066559}, "theme-color": "#b51218", "msapplication-TileImage": "/mstile-144x144.png", "article": {"section": "NEWS", "tag": "HealthPlus", "published_time": "2013-10-27T08:00:00-04:00", "modified_time": "2013-10-29T17:09:00-04:00", "author": "http://www.crainsdetroit.com/staff/JAYGRE"}, "verify-v1": "qPvWKmNahUcs8XBgUi+fy3A5YH6uzhhairJpQFCqXMs=", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no, minimal-ui"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd83f7\"", "article_summary": "Health insurance rates rising Among reasons cited: Cost trends, new required benefitsSmall businesses and individuals in Michigan have complained long and hard the past several weeks to health insurers, agents and state insurance regulators over health insurance renewal quotes they have received for 2014 that range from under 10 percent to up to 75 percent or more.\nUnder Obamacare, health insurance policies renewed in 2014 must comply with at least the 10 essential health benefits, including mental health, rehabilitation and prescription drugs.\nOver the past three years, average employer health insurance costs for midsize employers have ranged from 6 percent to 8 percent, according to Troy-based McGraw Wentworth's Mid-Market Group Benefits Survey.\nBuhs said the state insurance department is receiving a high volume of questions and complaints about having coverage discontinued and rates being increased.\nMike Embry, senior account director at Comerica Insurance Services Inc. in Detroit, said health insurers appear to be pricing their products fairly based on competitive pressures and additional costs they expect for 2014."}
