The Washington Redskins\u2018 left tackle had been saying for weeks that Reed was among the best tight ends in the NFL.\n\nEach week, there\u2019s more and more proof to that statement. The latest was on Saturday night, when Reed caught nine passes for 129 yards and two touchdowns in the Redskins 38-24 win over the Philadelphia Eagles to clinch the NFC East title.\n\n\u201cI feel like I say it every week, but yeah, he\u2019s one of the best,\u201d Williams said. \u201cHe proves it every time. The training he did this offseason, it\u2019s so evident and it shows every game. To frankly put it, he\u2019s a problem.\u201d\n\nThe touchdowns gave Reed 11 on the season, which tied Hall of Famer Bobby Mitchell\u2019s 11 in 1962 for the fifth-most receiving touchdowns in a single season in team history. Reed also broke the Redskins\u2018 single-season receiving yardage for a tight end with 849 yards, set previously by Chris Cooley in 2008 and 2010 and Jerry Smith in 1967. What is even more impressive about Reed\u2019s numbers is that he missed two games with a concussion earlier this season.\n\nThe third-year tight end has enjoyed a breakout season, due largely in part to the fact that he was able to stay healthy this season. Reed has been a constant matchup problem for opposing safeties and a nightmare for linebackers.\n\nIn the first quarter, Reed torched cornerback E.J. Biggers for a 28-yard gain. Biggers never had a chance. Three plays later, Reed hauled in a 22-yard touchdown pass and halted the momentum the Eagles\u2019 gained after scoring on the opening drive in less than three minutes. Eagles inside linebacker DeMeco Ryans never had a chance on the play. He bit on Kirk Cousins\u2019 play-action fake and the middle of the field was wide open.\n\n\u201cIt just goes to being healthy, being available,\u201d Reed said. \u201cIn years past I have been getting hurt. But God blessed me to stay healthy and I took advantage of it.\u201d\n\nOn the next drive, Reed hauled in three catches for 37 yards, including a 12-yard touchdown that gave Washington a 13-7 lead.\n\nIn the last three games for the Redskins, Reed has caught 26 passes for 333 yards and five touchdowns. Last week, when Williams was voted to the Pro Bowl and Reed an alternate, many felt the Redskins\u2018 tight end was snubbed. Williams said he told Reed to consider it an honor just to be in the conversation as one of the best in the league.\n\nOn Saturday, Reed proved why he legitimately is one of the best.", "article_metadata": {"description": "For the third consecutive game, Redskins tight end Jordan Reed proved why he is one of the best at his position in the NFL.
