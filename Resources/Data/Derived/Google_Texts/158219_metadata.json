Here\u2019s a look back at 15 times Schumer managed to tackle important topics in her inimitably sharp, fresh and funny way. Here\u2019s to 15 more to come!\n\n1. \u201cLast Fuckable Day\u201d\n\nIn this star-studded sketch from the Season 3 premiere, Schumer teams up with feminist icons Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Patricia Arquette and Tina Fey to celebrate Louis-Dreyfus\u2019 \u201clast fuckable day\u201d \u2014 namely, the day when \u201cthe media decides when you\u2019re not believably fuckable anymore.\u201d In turn, Schumer and co. brilliantly tackle the absurd and unfair Hollywood beauty standards that older actresses are subjected to.\n\n2. \u201cA Chick Who Can Hang\u201d\n\nThis Season 2 sketch plays on the pervasive (and unattainable) ideal of the \u201cCool Girl,\u201d and what an implausible male fantasy it represents. An example: One of the men in the sketch describes his ideal girl as \u201ccrazy hot; she could recite all of \u2018Boondock Saints\u2019 verbatim while rebuilding a deck.\u201d\n\n3. \u201cCool With it\u201d\n\nSchumer\u2019s \u201cCool With It\u201d sketch from this season similarly riffs on the Cool Girl trope \u2014 a woman attempts to act comfortable with accompanying her male co-workers to a strip club \u2014 before it flips into a surprising PSA about the wage gap. While our own Katie McDonough criticized the sketch\u2019s treatment of sex workers, the segment reflects Schumer\u2019s skill in highlighting the absurdity of culturally entrenched misogyny \u2014 in this case, unequal pay for women \u2014 by raising the stakes and spinning the narrative in a wacky and unexpected way. (The sketch isn\u2019t online, but you can watch the full episode here).\n\n4. \u201cA Very Realistic Military Game\u201d\n\nIn this hard-hitting sketch dealing with rape in the military, Schumer creates a female avatar in a realistic military video game, and things turn dark quickly. As Callie Beusman writes at Jezebel:\n\n\u201cThe sketch is great because [it] manages to do something so few other denizens of Comedy Central (cough, Daniel Tosh) have been capable of: it makes a rape joke that works \u2014 one that lampoons our bizarre, fucked up society for overlooking and tacitly condoning a sexual assault epidemic and not the victims of those assaults.\u201d\n\n5. \u201cFootball Town Nights\u201d\n\nIn a similar vein, this season\u2019s sketch about rape in a high school football town perfectly skewers the social attitudes that lead to rape culture, while never blaming the victims.\n\n6. \u201cCompliments\u201d\n\nThis much-discussed Season 1 sketch, in which women respond to compliments with extreme self-deprecation, has been lauded by many for its on-point commentary on the wider social pressure that forces women to constantly undervalue themselves, and to respond to praise with insecurity and self-effacement. As one of the women says in response to a compliment about her dye job: \u201cNo, I tried to look like Kate Hudson, and ended up looking like a golden retriever\u2019s dingleberry.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "From \"Last F**kable Day\" to \"Realistic Military Video Game,\" Schumer has nailed it time and time again VIDEO", "title": "15 feminist Amy Schumer sketches that will make you stand up and cheer", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "From \"Last F**kable Day\" to \"Realistic Military Video Game,\" Schumer has nailed it time and time again VIDEO", "title": "15 feminist Amy Schumer sketches that will make you stand up and cheer", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/05/03/15_feminist_amy_schumer_sketches_that_will_make_you_stand_up_and_cheer/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/05/inside_amy_schumer.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "From \"Last F**kable Day\" to \"Realistic Military Video Game,\" Schumer has nailed it time and time again VIDEO", "title": "15 feminist Amy Schumer sketches that will make you stand up and cheer", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/05/inside_amy_schumer.jpg", "creator": "@annaesilman", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Anna Silman", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Amy Schumer, Comedy, Editor's Picks, Inside Amy Schumer, Video", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Here\u2019s a look back at 15 times Schumer managed to tackle important topics in her inimitably sharp, fresh and funny way.\n\u201cA Very Realistic Military Game\u201dIn this hard-hitting sketch dealing with rape in the military, Schumer creates a female avatar in a realistic military video game, and things turn dark quickly.\n\u201cA Chick Who Can Hang\u201dThis Season 2 sketch plays on the pervasive (and unattainable) ideal of the \u201cCool Girl,\u201d and what an implausible male fantasy it represents.\nTopics: Amy Schumer, Comedy, Editor's Picks, Inside Amy Schumer, Video, Entertainment News\u201cInside Amy Schumer\u201d has been lauded for being one of the most outspokenly feminist shows on TV, one that uses comedy to highlight serious issues about body image pressures, gender stereotyping and sexual assault (as she put it at a recent Tribeca panel, \u201crape is good fodder for comedy because it\u2019s the worst thing in the world\u201d).\nAn example: One of the men in the sketch describes his ideal girl as \u201ccrazy hot; she could recite all of \u2018Boondock Saints\u2019 verbatim while rebuilding a deck.\u201d3."}
