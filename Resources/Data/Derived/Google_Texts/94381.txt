BELL CITY, La. (AP) - A popular fishing area known as Lacassine Pool on a national wildlife refuge in southwest Louisiana will be closed Monday and Tuesday due to road repairs.

The Lacassine Pool is a 16,000-acre habitat of freshwater marsh. Waterfowl like snow geese, teal, ducks, mallards and wigeon spend winter months in the area.

The Lacassine National Wildlife Refuge says work on the Illinois Plant Road on Monday and Tuesday will shut down access to the Lacassine Pool. Crews will replace a culvert under the road and make repairs.
