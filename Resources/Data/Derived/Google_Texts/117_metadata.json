The American Sociological Association (of which I am a member) and American Psychological Association, along with other professional organizations, had filed amici curiae briefs in the case.\n\nThese briefs reached a common conclusion: \u201cWhether a child is raised by same-sex or opposite-sex parents has no bearing on a child\u2019s well-being.\u201d\n\nScalia\u2019s claim was not merely a statement of opinion, but attempted to establish a fact: Social scientists disagree. But did they? Recently sociologists developed a strategy that allows researchers to answer questions like these empirically. Citation patterns among published research can be analyzed in a way that identifies if and when scientists achieved consensus about any particular question.\n\nSometimes social science can be quite straightforward, while other times the process is more complicated than we\u2019d like. The method I adopted to test Scalia\u2019s claim required using search terms to identify all existing research on outcomes for kids with same-sex parents. After doing that, I could determine if and when social scientists achieved consensus.\n\nDirectly adopting this approach led to results that I suspected indicated achieved consensus, but I wasn\u2019t yet convinced.\n\nUsing search terms to identify the potential corpus of salient research can err in the direction of including substantial amounts of unrelated research \u2014 in my case, for example, on how parents influence their children\u2019s same-sex attraction. This could have invalidated the interpretation of my results.\n\nMy collaborator Ryan Light of the University of Oregon solved this problem by providing three stages of increasingly restrictive criteria on how to identify the relevant research from among the possibly relevant articles I initially identified. When we got more or less the same results after applying each one of these new criteria, we were finally confident in our answer.\n\nPeer reviewers agreed. Our findings, published in Social Science Research, show that by the early 2000s, social scientists had reached agreement about outcomes for kids of same-sex parents: Children who have same-sex parents do not experience disadvantages compared to their counterparts with opposite-sex parents.\n\nWe thought this finding merited attention on its own, both responding to claims made in the case that sparked my initial interest and in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision legalizing same-sex marriage nationally (reached just days after our article was published).\n\nIf the Supreme Court\u2019s decision can be followed by similar advances for kids of same-sex parents in other factors we know to be detrimental to children \u2014 especially discrimination or parental partnership instability \u2014 the future should reveal only improvements for kids of same-sex parents.\n\nBeyond the specifics of same-sex marriage, our approach also informs how scientific evidence should inform judicial decisions. Courts looking to scientific evidence should never rely on a single study, but should consider the sum of accumulated scientific knowledge.\n\nWhile they often ask experts to testify about the state of knowledge to assist in this summary, such expert testimony can devolve into \u201che said-she said\u201d disagreements when multiple experts evaluate the same evidence on a question and come to conflicting conclusions. Our approach avoids this, and could be adopted by the courts as a validated, objective procedure for systematically measuring scientific consensus.\n\nIn the future, justices like Antonin Scalia need not use their amateur social science skills to weigh social science evidence. We hope, instead, that they will use an approach like ours to evaluate the knowledge base for a wide range of (social) scientific questions.\n\nJimi Adams is an associate professor in the Department of Health and Behavioral Sciences at the University of Colorado Denver.\n\nTo send a letter to the editor about this article, submit online or check out our guidelines for how to submit by e-mail or mail.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Guest Commentary: The consensus is that children from gay marriages are just fine", "title": "Guest Commentary: The consensus is that children from gay marriages are just fine", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/09/25/guest-commentary-the-consensus-is-that-children-from-gay-marriages-are-just-fine/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150925__20150927_Z00_OP27G_ADAMSp1.jpg", "height": 466}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150925__20150927_Z00_OP27G_ADAMSp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2015-09-25T10:58:15+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-21T18:04:22+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "In the future, justices like Antonin Scalia need not use their amateur social science skills to weigh social science evidence.\nSometimes social science can be quite straightforward, while other times the process is more complicated than we\u2019d like.\nAfter doing that, I could determine if and when social scientists achieved consensus.\nWe hope, instead, that they will use an approach like ours to evaluate the knowledge base for a wide range of (social) scientific questions.\nCourts looking to scientific evidence should never rely on a single study, but should consider the sum of accumulated scientific knowledge."}
