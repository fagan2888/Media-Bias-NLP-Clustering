Such \u201cnon-hospitalization\u201d plans did so \u2014 and at a lower cost than traditional healthcare coverage. An online calculator run by the federal government gave them the minimum-value green light.\n\nThat changed Tuesday. The agencies said they don\u2019t believe such plans should qualify as providing minimum value despite the calculator\u2019s finding.\n\n\u201cA plan that fails to provide substantial coverage for these services would fail to offer fundamental benefits that are nearly universally covered, and historically have been considered integral to coverage, under typical employer-sponsored group health plans,\u201d the agencies wrote in notice 2014-69.\n\nThere was relief for staffing firms and other employers who signed up for such plans before Tuesday. The new regulations would not affect them in 2015 as long as their plans begin by March 1.\n\n\u201cThis is very good news for staffing firms that were relying on MVP-type plans, particularly those on the commercial side who saw these as the only cost-effective way to avoid both ACA penalties,\u201d said Andrew Braswell, research analyst at Staffing Industry Analysts.\n\nExperts anticipated the federal government would put the kibosh on using such plans to qualify for minimum value, and that the \u201cno\u201d would come after the election. The rejection, in fact, came right on Election Day.\n\nFor a previous story, click here.\n\nMark Lam, VP of benefits compliance at Assurance, said this has been a known possibility, and there will be new plans developed to qualify for minimum value. Work is already taking place on alternatives.\n\n\u201cAs an agency we have over 500 staffing clients nationally, so this has been on our radar for quite some time,\u201d Lam said.\n\nA potential drawback from some alternative plans is they might not be as affordable for workers. For example, there could be high-deductible healthcare plans offered with a deductible of as much as $6,000 a year and a $100 monthly premium.\n\nNon-hospitalization plans could have offered rich coverage, albeit without the hospitalization, he said. \u201cNon-hospitalization plans still represent an option employers can consider. Employers can incorporate them as part of their overall approach to satisfying the mandate\u2019s requirements.\u201d\n\nPenalties background\n\nLarge employers \u2014 those with more than 50 full-time workers and full-time equivalents \u2014 will face penalties if they don\u2019t provide healthcare insurance starting in 2015.\n\nLarge employers who don\u2019t offer any healthcare coverage at all to at least 95 percent of full-time workers (or 70 percent in 2015 under transition relief) will face the \u201cA\u201d penalty. It amounts to $2,000 per year multiplied by all of a company\u2019s full-time workers. Staffing firms can avoid the \u201cA\u201d penalty by offering a \u201cminimum essential coverage\u201d plan \u2014 which are not in question. These \u201cskinny\u201d plans typically offer only preventive care, a specified number of doctor visits per year and, in some cases, generic prescription drugs. They don\u2019t cover hospital stays, surgical procedures or prenatal care. Minimum essential coverage plans are projected to cost $40 to $100 per month, according to Staffing Industry Analysts.\n\nThe other possible penalty is the \u201cB\u201d penalty for firms that offer coverage, but that coverage is deemed unaffordable (based on a workers W-2 wages) or does not meet minimum value. The penalty amounts to $3,000 times each full-time employee who receives a subsidy to buy health insurance through an exchange. It\u2019s the \u201cB\u201d penalty that non-hospitalization plans would have allowed staffing firms to avoid.\n\nWorkers\n\nTuesday\u2019s notice also reported employees offered non-hospitalization plans would still be eligible for tax credits to buy insurance on a state exchange, if they qualified. This would be the case even in 2015.\n\nTuesday\u2019s notice:\n\nhttp://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/n-14-69.pdf\n\nAffordable Care Act page:\n\nhttp://www.irs.gov/uac/Affordable-Care-Act-of-2010-News-Releases-Multimedia-and-Legal-Guidance", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "ACA, Affordable Care Act,", "MSSmartTagsPreventParsing": "TRUE", "description": "Federal agencies rejected a health plan setup that allowed employers to avoid ACA penalties while offering coverage to workers that, while affordable, did not cover in-patient hospitalization.", "generator": "eZ Publish"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf143\"", "article_summary": "Home \u00bbEditorial \u00bbDaily News \u00bbNon-hospital plans won\u2019t forestall possible ACA penalties \u2014 but relief offered for 2015Daily News View All NewsNon-hospital plans won\u2019t forestall possible ACA penalties \u2014 but relief offered for 2015November 05 2014Federal agencies rejected a health plan setup that allowed employers to avoid ACA penalties while offering coverage to workers that, while affordable, did not cover in-patient hospitalization.\nFor example, there could be high-deductible healthcare plans offered with a deductible of as much as $6,000 a year and a $100 monthly premium.\nThe agencies said they don\u2019t believe such plans should qualify as providing minimum value despite the calculator\u2019s finding.\nMinimum essential coverage plans are projected to cost $40 to $100 per month, according to Staffing Industry Analysts.\nLarge employers face Affordable Care Act penalties next year if they don\u2019t provide healthcare coverage that is affordable and provides a minimum value of coverage."}
