As a result, it says, Medicaid patients often find that they must wait for months or travel long distances to see a doctor.\n\nThe inspector general, Daniel R. Levinson, said federal and state officials must do more to protect beneficiaries\u2019 access to care, in view of the program\u2019s rapid growth. Just since October, the administration says, eight million people with low incomes have enrolled. By 2016, the Congressional Budget Office estimates, one in four Americans will be on Medicaid at some time during the year.\n\nTwenty-seven states have expanded Medicaid eligibility since the passage of the health care law in 2010, and President Obama is urging other states to do so.\n\nMost states hire insurance companies to manage care for Medicaid patients. In return for monthly fees, the insurers provide comprehensive services through networks of selected doctors and hospitals. Federal rules say managed-care organizations must \u201cprovide adequate access to all services covered,\u201d but states can define what \u201cadequate\u201d means.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSome states set time and distance standards for access to doctors. Other states specify the maximum number of days that a Medicaid patient should have to wait for an appointment. Still others require a minimum number of doctors and other providers, based on the number of people in a health plan.\n\nIn some places, insurers must have at least one primary care provider for every 100 Medicaid beneficiaries, while other states require at least one for every 2,500. Some states say Medicaid patients should be able to see specialists within 15 days, while others allow waits up to 60 days.\n\nIn any event, the inspector general said, most states have not cited any insurers for violations in the last five years, and the federal government \u201cprovides limited oversight of state standards for access to care.\u201d Three states, Georgia, New York and Ohio, accounted for three-fourths of violations reported in the last five years.\n\nThe federal government \u201cuses a checklist to confirm that states have access standards,\u201d but does not analyze whether the standards ensure access to care, Mr. Levinson said. Federal officials, he said, view the setting of standards as \u201cprimarily a state responsibility.\u201d\n\nIn assessing whether health plans have enough doctors, states typically rely on information supplied by insurers, Mr. Levinson said, but \u201cthis information is often inaccurate or out of date.\u201d Some doctors are no longer in health plan networks. Some are not taking new Medicaid patients. Some were never at the address listed in the insurer\u2019s directory of providers.\n\nOnly a handful of states try to verify the information reported by insurers \u2014 for example, by making \u201csecret shopper\u201d calls to doctors\u2019 offices, the report said.\n\nMarilyn B. Tavenner, the administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, generally agreed with recommendations by the inspector general, who said federal and state Medicaid officials should adopt stronger standards for access to care and do more to enforce them. Ms. Tavenner said she expected to provide \u201cadditional guidance to states,\u201d but did not say when.\n\nJeff M. Myers, the president of Medicaid Health Plans of America, a trade group, said: \u201cOur plans do everything they can to make sure beneficiaries have access to the care they need. But in some underserved areas, it\u2019s very hard to find additional specialists and primary care physicians.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHealth plans often provide transportation to help Medicaid patients get to doctor\u2019s appointments, Mr. Myers said. And some try to recruit doctors by offering to pay them more.\n\nMr. Levinson\u2019s findings are likely to fuel concern across the political spectrum.\n\n\u201cMedicaid shows that access to a government health care program does not guarantee access to health care,\u201d said Senator Tom Coburn, Republican of Oklahoma.\n\nSarah Somers, who represents poor individuals as a lawyer at the National Health Law Program, said federal Medicaid standards must be updated because \u201cbeneficiaries have reported serious problems obtaining the care they need, particularly reproductive health and specialty care.\u201d\n\nThe inspector general\u2019s report focused on Medicaid, but Obama administration officials are wrestling with similar issues as they set standards for private health plans sold on insurance exchanges under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nStandards for \u201cnetwork adequacy\u201d have become an explosive political issue. Many consumer advocates want the federal government to set stricter standards. But many insurers say they have been able to hold down premiums by providing access to a limited group of doctors and hospitals.\n\nThe Obama administration is caught in the middle. It wants to guarantee access to a wide range of providers while holding down premiums, which are paid by consumers and subsidized by the federal government.\n\nMr. Levinson said federal Medicaid officials should require states to develop standards for access to primary care doctors and specialists, including obstetricians and pediatricians. In addition, he said, states may need to set specific standards for urban and rural areas. And he recommended that state officials call doctors\u2019 offices to check whether they were taking new Medicaid patients.\n\nThe federal government has a big stake in Medicaid and reviews and approves all managed-care contracts.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20140927124211, "twitter": {"description": "A federal report says state standards for access to health care are rarely enforced and that Medicaid patients may wait for months or travel long distances to see a doctor.", "title": "For Many New Medicaid Enrollees, Care Is Hard to Find, Report Says", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/28/us/for-many-new-medicaid-enrollees-care-is-hard-to-find-report-says.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003142816"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_150_black.png", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/28/us/for-many-new-medicaid-enrollees-care-is-hard-to-find-report-says.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003142816", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/28/us/for-many-new-medicaid-enrollees-care-is-hard-to-find-report-says.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "us", "channels": "NytNow", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/us/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "Sept. 27, 2014", "edt": "NewYork", "org": "Health and Human Services Department", "keywords": "Medicaid,Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (2010),Health Insurance and Managed Care,Health and Human Services Department,Obama  Barack", "news_keywords": "Medicaid", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "Robert Pear", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "per": "Obama, Barack", "byl": "By ROBERT PEAR", "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "A federal report says state standards for access to health care are rarely enforced and that Medicaid patients may wait for months or travel long distances to see a doctor.", "tom": "News", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "description": "A federal report says state standards for access to health care are rarely enforced and that Medicaid patients may wait for months or travel long distances to see a doctor.", "CG": "us", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "Sept. 27, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "News", "article": {"author": "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/p/robert_pear/index.html", "section_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/pages/national/index.html", "section": "U.S.", "modified": "2014-10-01", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/us/index.jsonp", "tag": "Obama, Barack", "published": "2014-09-27", "section-taxonomy-id": "23FD6C8B-62D5-4CEA-A331-6C2A9A1223BE"}, "slug": "28medicaid", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20141001152106, "hdl_p": "For Many New Medicaid Enrollees, Care Is Hard to Find, Report Says", "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/28/us/for-many-new-medicaid-enrollees-care-is-hard-to-find-report-says.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_291_black.png", "type": "article", "description": "A federal report says state standards for access to health care are rarely enforced and that Medicaid patients may wait for months or travel long distances to see a doctor.", "title": "For Many New Medicaid Enrollees, Care Is Hard to Find, Report Says"}, "pdate": 20140927, "des": "Health Insurance and Managed Care", "articleid": 100000003142816, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "For Many New Medicaid Enrollees, Care Is Hard to Find, Report Says", "PST": "News"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd719e\"", "article_summary": "\u201cMedicaid shows that access to a government health care program does not guarantee access to health care,\u201d said Senator Tom Coburn, Republican of Oklahoma.\nMr. Levinson said federal Medicaid officials should require states to develop standards for access to primary care doctors and specialists, including obstetricians and pediatricians.\nTwenty-seven states have expanded Medicaid eligibility since the passage of the health care law in 2010, and President Obama is urging other states to do so.\nAnd he recommended that state officials call doctors\u2019 offices to check whether they were taking new Medicaid patients.\nThe inspector general, Daniel R.
