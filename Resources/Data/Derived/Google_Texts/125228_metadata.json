The rally came as a rebound after investors initially sold off the shares after learning that Twitter grew its user base by only 1.4 percent from the prior quarter. That was 4 million accounts \u2014 far below analysts\u2019 estimates and the prior three quarters\u2019 growth levels.\n\nFortunes quickly changed when Twitter executives got on a conference call with investors and explained that the slow growth was due to a bug tied to Apple\u2019s latest operating system and routine seasonal slowness. They said January was going great guns and it looks like user growth for the current quarter would be back to prior levels \u2014 more like 14 million.\n\nRelated: Twitter Co-founder Biz Stone on Winning Silicon Valley's Battles\n\nTwitter\u2019s fickle friends on Wall Street rushed to buy. But even if investors are temporarily satisfied, there are still reasons for concern about the company\u2019s ability to hold onto its status as one of the Web\u2019s titans. Here are five lingering questions about Twitter\u2019s future:\n\nIs Twitter attracting enough new users? And young ones?\n\nTwitter\u2019s Q4 user growth was the lowest on record. It won\u2019t be clear until the next quarter if that was really due to temporary hiccups or a shift in Internet appetites. CEO Dick Costolo himself admitted in an internal memo leaked to the press just the day before the company posted earnings that abusive \u201ctrolls\u201d on its service were scaring off new users.\n\nTwitter is actually quite a bit smaller than its big-time rivals. It now has 288 million active monthly users compared to Facebook\u2019s 1.3 billion. Perhaps more concerning, Instagram, a comparative newbie owned by Facebook, now boasts 300 million active monthly users.\n\nConcerns have long existed that Twitter isn\u2019t popular with young people. In a viral blog post explaining how teenagers use social media, a 19-year-old student at the University of Texas at Austin wrote, \u201cTo be honest, a lot of us simply do not understand the point of Twitter.\u201d Instagram and Snapchat are teens\u2019 social networks of choice.\n\nRelated: 6 Brands \u200bThat May Not Make It Through 2015\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\n\nMorningstar technology strategist Rick Summer questions whether Twitter can ever reach the size of giants like Google and Facebook. Without that kind of massive scale, he doesn\u2019t think it can compete to win the advertising business it needs for revenue growth. Other analysts, such as Pivotal Research Group\u2019s Brian Wieser, say Twitter doesn\u2019t need more user growth to build a large, successful business.\n\nWhere are the profits?\n\nTwitter is still posting a large, but shrinking, net loss each quarter \u2014 $125 million for the last three months of 2014. But looking at a cash flow figure called EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization), Twitter is starting to make money. It earned $141 million in the last quarter, or 12 cents per diluted share, when analysts were expecting six cents.\n\nSales in Q4 were $479 million, also better than analyst expectations for $453 million. Wieser sums it up as \u201ca very positive business story.\u201d\n\nUntil Twitter\u2019s traditional GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) results get in the black, questions about profitability will linger, though. Twitter\u2019s stock fell 40 percent in 2014, when its annual operating loss was $577 million.\n\nWill changes the company is making work?\n\nTwitter has been criticized in recent years for a failure to innovate. It\u2019s responding now by unveiling a host of new features.\n\nIt has rolled out a new \u201cwhile you were away\u201d section to its scroll to highlight missed posts, group direct messaging and new video functionality, all of which should appeal to users. Just this month, the company renewed a deal with Google and arranged that real-time tweets will show up in search engine results. That won\u2019t roll out for a couple of months, but it should help bring new users to the service. Twitter is also experimenting with new ways to make its homepage more interesting to visitors who haven\u2019t logged in or created an account yet. Finally, it is building a new revenue stream by syndicating sponsored tweets to third-party sites like Flipboard and Yahoo Japan.\n\nIt\u2019s a lot all at once. But if some of those changes stick, concerns about the company failing to innovate should be appeased.\n\nIs Costolo the right CEO?\n\nCostolo, who became CEO in 2010, started off the year as the quintessential embattled CEO. Everyone from CNBC\u2019s Jim Cramer to stock analysts to a prominent Harvard Business School professor was calling publicly for his ouster.\n\nRelated: Twitter CEO Wins Breathing Room from Wall Street Critics\n\nThe improved business metrics plus the new launches in January have eased some of the pressure, at least for now. \u201cA number of encouraging factors pointing to reacceleration,\u201d Nomura analyst Anthony DiClemente wrote in a research note Thursday.\n\nMost of Costolo\u2019s detractors will vanish with the improved stock price. But expect to hear more concerns about his leadership if user growth remains slow and the stock price slumps again.\n\nIs the stock too expensive?\n\nThe simple answer is yes. Twitter\u2019s forward price-earnings multiple is 64, based on non-GAAP earnings estimates. Nomura raised its price target after the latest earnings report to $48 a share from $45. Morningstar puts the fair value of Twitter shares at $40. The stock closed Friday at $48.\n\nFriday\u2019s run-up shows that many investors\u2019 concerns about growth, management and innovation were appeased with the latest results and management commentary. But, as was evident in Thursday night\u2019s flip-flop, Twitter investors can be quick to change their minds. Costolo and his team still have plenty of work to do.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The stock is way up, but questions linger about its status as an Internet titan.", "title": "5 Burning Questions Still Facing Twitter", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/02/09/5-Burning-Questions-Still-Facing-Twitter-and-CEO-Dick-Costolo", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/08162013_Twitter_Stocks_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/02/09/5-Burning-Questions-Still-Facing-Twitter-and-CEO-Dick-Costolo", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/08162013_Twitter_Stocks_article.jpg", "creator": "@ameystone", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "The stock is way up, but questions linger about its status as an Internet titan.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd420b\"", "article_summary": "But, as was evident in Thursday night\u2019s flip-flop, Twitter investors can be quick to change their minds.\nOther analysts, such as Pivotal Research Group\u2019s Brian Wieser, say Twitter doesn\u2019t need more user growth to build a large, successful business.\nTwitter stock (NASDAQ:TWTR) closed last week on an up note, surging 16 percent to close at $48 a share the day after reporting fourth-quarter earnings.\nBut expect to hear more concerns about his leadership if user growth remains slow and the stock price slumps again.\nHere are five lingering questions about Twitter\u2019s future:Is Twitter attracting enough new users?"}
