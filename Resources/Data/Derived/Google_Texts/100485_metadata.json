Yet more light isn\u2019t shone on this topic because of the stigma that surrounds it. According to Parity, an organization in the United Kingdom aimed at achieving equal rights for both men and women, domestic violence is seen as a woman\u2019s problem and not a social problem affecting both sexes. Dare London decided Parity should conduct its own hidden camera experiment to show how people react when a man is the victim of domestic violence.\n\nThe campaign released by the ManKind Initiative called #ViolenceIsViolence showed a couple, portrayed by two actors, fighting in a park. In the first scene, the man is seen yelling and roughing up his girlfriend. Strangers see the incident and intervene to help the woman. One woman walks up to the man and yells, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d She tells him that if she doesn\u2019t call the cops, other people will. She then turns to the woman and lets her know that she doesn\u2019t have to put up with this behavior.\n\nIn the second scene, the man is victim to the abuse. However, instead of people offering help, we see something else \u2014 laughter. Onlookers find the fight amusing, and you can actually see people smiling. No one helps the abused man.\n\nAccording to the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence, about one in 14 men is assaulted by his partner annually.\n\nThe chair of ManKind\u2019s board of trustees, Mark Brooks told the NY Daily News that the fight between rapper Jay Z and his sister-in-law, Solange Knowles, was an inspiration for this video. He added, however, he had the idea for this project for a few years.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "domestic violence against males", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "With such a high rate of domestic violence, why is this group overlooked?", "title": "Women On Men: The Other Side Of Domestic Violence [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/domestic-violence-against-males-40-victims-are-men-so-why-are-we-still-ignoring-it-284682", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/05/27/domestic-violence-against-males.PNG", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "With such a high rate of domestic violence, why is this group overlooked?", "title": "Women On Men: The Other Side Of Domestic Violence [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/domestic-violence-against-males-40-victims-are-men-so-why-are-we-still-ignoring-it-284682", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/05/27/domestic-violence-against-males.PNG", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/05/27/domestic-violence-against-males.PNG"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2014-05-27T11:36:33-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-05-27T12:16:25-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "With such a high rate of domestic violence, why is this group overlooked?"}, "article_summary": "Domestic violence affects 40 percent of men.\nAccording to the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence, about one in 14 men is assaulted by his partner annually.\nDare London decided Parity should conduct its own hidden camera experiment to show how people react when a man is the victim of domestic violence.\nAccording to Parity, an organization in the United Kingdom aimed at achieving equal rights for both men and women, domestic violence is seen as a woman\u2019s problem and not a social problem affecting both sexes.\nIn the first scene, the man is seen yelling and roughing up his girlfriend."}
