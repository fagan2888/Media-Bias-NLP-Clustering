Heritage Action spokesman Dan Holler released the following statement Wednesday morning:\n\n\u201cBetween now and the inauguration of the next president, Planned Parenthood will carry out more than 440,000 abortions. The objective is not simply \u2018to get a bill on President Obama\u2019s desk.\u2019 The primary objective is to defund this organization. Pro-life members should not be asked to cast a vote for a bill that sends money to Planned Parenthood.\u201d\n\nScalise, R-La., told CQ Roll on Tuesday in an exclusive phone interview that he wanted to use the process of budget reconciliation to strip funding from Planned Parenthood, which is under scrutiny after the release of a series of undercover videos in which organization officials discuss the harvesting of fetal tissue.\n\nThe No. 3 House Republican explained a reconciliation bill cannot be filibustered in the Senate, thereby ensuring passage by a simple majority of the chamber's GOP. Most other controversial measures coming before the Senate under standard rules and procedure need to clear a 60-vote threshold, which has stymied Republicans time and again. That outcome is certain to transpire for any spending bill that includes a policy rider stripping out money for Planned Parenthood.\n\n\"If one of the objectives is to get a bill on President Obama\u2019s desk that defunds Planned Parenthood, then budget reconciliation is the one way to ensure that happens. This is the most sure-fire way,\" Scalise told CQ Roll Call.\n\nScalise deflected when asked directly whether his reconciliation strategy was intended to avoid a government shutdown on Oct. 1, saying only that House Republicans would continue to keep the pressure on Planned Parenthood as more of the undercover videos are released.\n\nThe House will vote on two stand-alone bills this week to hamper the organization, which Republican leaders hope will be enough to satisfy their base on and off Capitol Hill.\n\nThose who don't want to tie Planned Parenthood defunding to a government spending bill got some good news Wednesday morning. In spite of Heritage Action's stern warning to members, the National Right to Life Committee is on their side.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Heritage Action for America is not impressed with House Majority Whip Steve Scalise's proposal to address conservatives' opposition to Planned Parenthood through a budget reconciliation process instead of a continuing resolution.", "og": {"site_name": "Roll Call", "description": "Heritage Action for America is not impressed with House Majority Whip Steve Scalise's proposal to address conservatives' opposition to Planned Parenthood through a budget reconciliation process instead of a continuing resolution.", "title": "Heritage Action Dismisses Scalise's Planned Parenthood Strategy", "url": "http://www.rollcall.com/news/home/heritage-action-skeptical-scalises-budget-reconciliation-strategy", "image": {"identifier": "http://cdn.images.rollcall.com/image/1ed71e81ff466910ac598f06d393a96c/blogs/sites/2/2015/09/scalise_013_060215-445x296.jpg", "type": "image/png"}, "updated_time": "2015-09-16T16:27:46Z", "type": "website"}, "abstract": "Heritage Action for America is not impressed with House Majority Whip Steve Scalise's proposal to address conservatives' opposition to Planned Parenthood through a budget reconciliation process instead of a continuing resolution.", "fb": {"app_id": 1383531991672364}, "keywords": "Blog ID,Author,category,category,category,category,author,category,category,category,category,category,category,category,category,category,category,category,category,category,category,category,CQToday Topic,abortion,barack-obama,congressional-operations,conservatives,fundraising,gop-brand,government-shutdown,health-care,heritage-action,life-in-congress,members,messaging,outside-groups,oversight,polling,republicans-2,rules-and-procedure,staff,whip-count,abrt", "article": {"section": "home", "published_time": "2015-09-16T16:27:46Z", "modified_time": "2015-09-16T16:27:46Z"}, "twitter": {"description": "Heritage Action for America is not impressed with House Majority Whip Steve Scalise's proposal to address conservatives' opposition to Planned Parenthood through a budget reconciliation process inst", "title": "Heritage Action Dismisses Scalise's Planned Parenthood Strategy", "url": "http://www.rollcall.com/news/home/heritage-action-skeptical-scalises-budget-reconciliation-strategy", "image": {"src": "http://cdn.images.rollcall.com/image/1ed71e81ff466910ac598f06d393a96c/blogs/sites/2/2015/09/scalise_013_060215-445x296.jpg"}, "site": "@rollcall", "card": "summary |player (See: https://dev.twitter.com/cards/types/player We will have to submit a test and get approval before using this type)"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3e12\"", "article_summary": "Heritage Action spokesman Dan Holler released the following statement Wednesday morning:\u201cBetween now and the inauguration of the next president, Planned Parenthood will carry out more than 440,000 abortions.\nHeritage Action for America is not impressed with House Majority Whip Steve Scalise's proposal to address conservatives' opposition to Planned Parenthood through a budget reconciliation process instead of a continuing resolution.\nThose who don't want to tie Planned Parenthood defunding to a government spending bill got some good news Wednesday morning.\nThat outcome is certain to transpire for any spending bill that includes a policy rider stripping out money for Planned Parenthood.\n\"If one of the objectives is to get a bill on President Obama\u2019s desk that defunds Planned Parenthood, then budget reconciliation is the one way to ensure that happens."}
