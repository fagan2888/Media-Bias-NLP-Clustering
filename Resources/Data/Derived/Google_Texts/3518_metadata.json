What binds two different acts of creation \u2014 writing fiction and programming a computer \u2014 together and what sunders them apart? To successfully answer such questions, one needs to be both a superlative writer and a smart programmer, equally at home building worlds out of words and software code.\n\nIn \u201cGeek Sublime: The Beauty of Code, the Code of Beauty,\u201d the novelist and programmer Vikram Chandra proves himself exactly that kind of multidimensional world traveler. Chandra weaves a comprehensive understanding of the history, practice and art of programming into a startling fabric that includes a fascinating dose of classical Indian philosophy and his own lifelong creative journey as a writer. Unexpected connections abound.\n\nTo pick just one typical example of his cross-discipline riffing:\n\nAt the end of a discussion (a meditation? exploration? evocation?) about something called dhvani \u2014 the theory of \u201caesthetic suggestion\u201d formulated by 9th century Indian philosopher Anandavardhana \u2014 Chandra suddenly leaps across time and and space and quotes the American writer Flannery O\u2019Connor:\n\nYou tell a story because a statement would be inadequate. When anybody asks what a story is about, the only proper thing is to tell him to read the story. The meaning of fiction is not abstract meaning but experienced meaning.\n\nFor a reviewer, Chandra\u2019s diversion to O\u2019Connor is a challenge and a subtle joke about the act of reading the book itself. What is \u201cGeek Sublime\u201d about? Don\u2019t ask me \u2014 just read it!\n\nLike poetry, \u201cGeek Sublime\u201d seems designed not to be summarized, but to be felt. As the last words of the book resonate through your brain \u2014 \u201cIn the practice of fiction what is tasted \u2014 first and then again \u2014 is consciousness itself\u201d \u2014 you\u2019ll suddenly understand what the poet T. S. Eliot was trying to communicate when he described two years of Sanskrit study as having left him in \u201ca state of enlightened mystification.\u201d\n\n(Did you know, by the way, that a very strong case can be made that Sanskrit was the first programming language? Because I did not. But thanks to Chandra, I am now convinced.)\n\nOkay, yes, my job here is do more than evoke, and honestly, it isn\u2019t that impossible a task. Because \u201cGeek Sublime\u201d turns out to be about a great many things. In the space of a mere 210 pages, Chandra covers broad territory. \u201cGeek Sublime\u201d is instantly essential to any further discussion of of whether computer code can be thought of as the same kind of exercise in creativity delivered by music or painting. (The short answer: no.) He brings keen new insight into the troubling gender divide in the American software industry. (His points about how the Indian software industry is far less male-dominated than in the U.S. crushes theories that programming is somehow intrinsically male.) Perhaps most unexpectedly, while exploring the psychology of coders and writers, he manages to integrate the vast legacy of Indian intellectual history into contemporary conversations about the meaning of art and experience. He manages to get as close to the machine as any previous literary inquisition of coding, to explain exactly how computing happens, how ones and zeroes are translated into action, while simultaneously soaring into the delicate ether of the most refined aesthetic spirituality. It is a dazzle, from beginning to end.\n\nWho knew that Vikram Chandra \u2014 the author of three novels, and teacher of creative writing at UC Berkeley \u2014 was such a geek? When James Gleick (the author of \u201cChaos Theory\u201d and \u201cThe Information\u201d) reviewed \u201cGeek Sublime\u201d for the New York Times Book Review two weeks ago, I thought the name sounded familiar. And yes, it turned out that I had devoured Chandra\u2019s sprawling, epic novel about India, \u201cSacred Games,\u201d seven years ago. But of the fact that Chandra had supported his early writing life by working as a programmer, I had not a clue. That he\u2019s as nimble manipulating code as he is at narrative flow was a revelation. Plenty of programmers consider themselves artists, and plenty of writers presume to declaim about programming. But very, very few can comfortably inhabit both worlds with such grace and precision.", "article_metadata": {"description": "In a stunning new book, author Vikram Chandra explores the mystical complexities hiding in our laptops and iPhones", "author": "Andrew Leonard", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "In a stunning new book, author Vikram Chandra explores the mystical complexities hiding in our laptops and iPhones", "title": "Adventures in geek mythology: The mystic\u2019s guide to computing", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/09/06/adventures_in_geek_mythology_the_mystics_guide_to_computing/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/09/vikram_chandra.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "In a stunning new book, author Vikram Chandra explores the mystical complexities hiding in our laptops and iPhones", "creator": "@koxinga21", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/09/vikram_chandra.jpg", "title": "Adventures in geek mythology: The mystic\u2019s guide to computing", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Adventures in geek mythology: The mystic\u2019s guide to computing", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Books, Computer code, Computer programming, Computers, Editor's Picks, geek culture, Geek Sublime, Vikram Chandra", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Topics: Books, Computer code, Computer programming, Computers, Editor's Picks, geek culture, Geek Sublime, Vikram Chandra, Innovation News, Technology News, Life News, Entertainment NewsIs computer code art?\nLike poetry, \u201cGeek Sublime\u201d seems designed not to be summarized, but to be felt.\nIn \u201cGeek Sublime: The Beauty of Code, the Code of Beauty,\u201d the novelist and programmer Vikram Chandra proves himself exactly that kind of multidimensional world traveler.\nBecause \u201cGeek Sublime\u201d turns out to be about a great many things.\nWhat is \u201cGeek Sublime\u201d about?"}
