More than 100 Marines are being fed a Thanksgiving meal, thanks to some generous folks who open up their homes.

Fairfield Harbour matches families with Camp Lejeune Marines who can't go home for the holiday. Both the families and Marines say they look forward to it every year.

On Thursday, Marines were assigned to a family and then joined them for dinner. Organizers say the program is in its eighth year.

Emily and Ron Helling have been hosting Marines since the program began. The Helling's say they don't have family of their own and look forward to helping out our service members.

"It's really a time to reflect on the life we have had and how fortunate we have been," says Ron Helling. "We have the opportunity to share our fortune with other people and it's not looking forward to Black Friday, it's just sharing the day with people and really having a wonderful time."

Fairfield Harbour holds a similar program in the summer where Marines can enjoy a picnic off base.
