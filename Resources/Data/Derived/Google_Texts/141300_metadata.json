I\u2019m a dude. That doesn\u2019t mean I shouldn\u2019t be able to write about feminism. But it does mean that some readers can and will object to a piece by a guy about women who call themselves feminists and who also watch football.\n\nSo let me say for the record that I am not trying to mansplain the evils of football to feminists, or suggest how they should feel about something as complex as football. What I am trying to do is to understand why women, and feminists in particular, not only tolerate but in some instances consume (and therefore sponsor) a game as flagrantly misogynistic as football.\n\nBut before I get into all that, I want to talk about Hannah Storm, because she\u2019s the one who got me thinking about all this. Last Sunday, Storm took a few minutes on Sportscenter to rebuke the NFL for its conduct around the Ray Rice scandal and violence against women more generally. The veteran broadcaster and ESPN anchor explained that she and her three daughters were all huge football fans. \u201cOne of my daughters has her first fantasy football team this season,\u201d she noted. \u201cBut at breakfast this week, instead of discussing how her team was doing, we watched the Ray Rice video play out again, in all its ugliness.\u201d\n\nStorm added that she\u2019d spent the week answering a series of \u201cseemingly impossible questions\u201d from her daughters about the league, then posed a few of her own, such as when the NFL would \u201ctake the lead on the issue of domestic violence,\u201d and, more dramatically, \u201cWhat exactly does the NFL stand for?\u201d\n\nThe response to this soliloquy was a rousing chorus of Give \u2019em hell, Hannah! So maybe I\u2019m the only person in America who came away with a few questions of my own \u2014 for Storm.\n\nFor instance: If you\u2019re so troubled by the NFL, why do you collect a salary promoting it? Also, why would a mother watch with her own daughter a video of a man knocking a woman unconscious? And as a mother with three daughters, how do you justify glorifying a game that defines men as heroically violent warriors and women as sexual ornaments who jiggle on the sidelines?\n\nAgain: I realize this sounds like one of those smug cable-news questions, especially coming from a man. It\u2019s not. I\u2019m genuinely baffled. As a fan (a heartbroken former fan, anyway) I understand why football exerts such a powerful grip on men. The game is an exalted cult of hyper-masculinity, a place of refuge where dudes can escape the moral complexities and disappointments of adulthood, where heroism is defined as courageous and brutal and, above all, male.\n\nBut as a father of daughters, I can\u2019t help wondering: What\u2019s in it for women? This is an especially timely question not just because of recent events, but because the NFL is constantly bragging that women make up 45 percent of its fan base.\n\nAs it turns out, a number of female fans have addressed their fandom over the past few weeks. The most prominent of these pieces, by Eliana Dockterman, a writer for Time, carried the headline \u201cWhy Women Don\u2019t Have to Boycott the NFL.\u201d The entire piece, in fact, exuded a kind of panicky defensiveness.\n\n\u201cI am a feminist who writes about feminist issues,\u201d Dockterman begins. \u201cWhen accusations surfaced that the NFL commissioner Roger Goodell and many others in the league might have systematically tried to cover up a video of Ray Rice punching his wife, I was disgusted and outraged. And yet on Sunday, I kicked back and tuned in to football without any qualms. Am I a hypocrite?\u201d\n\nOddly, she spends much of the rest of her piece detailing the many qualms about football that she absolutely positively doesn\u2019t have, such as the fact that the sport is inherently sexist. \u201cThe NFL doesn\u2019t care if I\u2019m a conflicted fan,\u201d she observes, \u201cas long as it is getting my money \u2026 Only actions will bring about change because words of outrage result in lackluster press releases.\u201d\n\nThe tag line of Dockterman\u2019s piece is \u201cAn Argument for Feminists Who Watch Football.\u201d But Dockterman never actually talks about feminism itself. She never addresses the belief (for instance) that women are entitled to equal treatment in the workplace and shouldn\u2019t be reduced to sexual objects or otherwise marginalized.\n\nThe game Dockterman loves is, in fact, a $10 billion industry made up almost entirely of men: male players, male coaches, male trainers, male executives, male owners. Its gender roles aren\u2019t antiquated; they\u2019re medieval.\n\n(In fact, about the only powerful woman in football is former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, a devout fan who is nearly a lock to replace Goodell when he gets the shit can.)\n\nSo what is Dockterman\u2019s goal-line stand on behalf of the game? \u201cBoycotting the NFL is simply not the best way to change its behavior,\u201d she insists. Instead, female fans need to advocate \u201cfor change within the system.\u201d How? Well, for instance, by tweeting.\n\n\u201cBut let\u2019s be honest,\u201d Dockterman intones, \u201cdespite what I said earlier about hitting the NFL where it hurts the most\u2014their wallets\u2014nothing will ever stop the cash flow. If you feel strongly about women\u2019s rights and have a platform from which to express your views (say, a Twitter account) then you can make a difference at least in your circle of friends and contacts by forcing them to think about the debate \u2026 Tune out if you want to. But the real solution is to scream at the top of your lungs.\u201d\n\nDockterman, in other words, is attempting to guilt trip those female fans with the integrity (and common sense) to turn away from the game. It seems never to have occurred to her that one might protest football without actually watching it at the same time.\n\nWhat\u2019s most frustrating about this piece, and others like it, isn\u2019t the illogic of its arguments but the absence of self-reflection. It simply never offers any insight into why some women love football, and how they square this love with their feminist beliefs.", "article_metadata": {"description": "There's no way around it: Football is the most brutally misogynistic sport ever created.
