Gardiner has made helping people with developmental disabilities his signature issue while serving as president.\n\nThe drug-prescribing and insurance bills (HB 423 and HB 221) were among the final measures passed during the 60-day session, which ended at 6:45 p.m. Friday.\n\nAdvanced registered nurse practitioners have long lobbied for the authority to prescribe controlled substances. But the idea ran into the lobbying might of physician groups, which have opposed the proposals.\n\nThis year's bill, spearheaded by Rep. Cary Pigman, R-Avon Park, and Sen. Denise Grimsley, R-Sebring, also would grant the power to prescribe controlled substances to physician assistants. The measure now goes to Gov. Rick Scott.\n\n\"It's been a long battle, and well worth the fight,\" Florida Nurses Association Executive Director Willa Fuller said in a prepared statement. \"The passage of this bill is a huge victory for nurses and patients.\"\n\nThe balance-billing issue also drew intense lobbying during the session, as it affects health insurers, doctors and hospitals.\n\nThe issue centers on patients who have preferred provider organization, or PPO, insurance coverage and go to hospitals for emergency treatment. Supporters of the legislation say those patients sometimes get unexpected bills because doctors in the hospitals are not part of the insurance plans' networks.\n\nThe legislation, at least in part, would set up a dispute-resolution process that backers say would help shield patients from unexpected bills and leave it to health-care providers and insurers to work out payment issues. State Chief Financial Officer Jeff Atwater and the Florida Association of Health Plans pushed for the proposed changes, sponsored by Rep. Carlos Trujillo, R-Miami, and Sen. Rene Garcia, R-Hialeah.\n\nBut the Senate added a late twist to the balance-billing measure when it approved an amendment Friday to require insurance plans to cover such services as speech therapy, occupational therapy and physical therapy for people with Down syndrome. The change expands part of a law that took effect in 2009 for people with autism spectrum disorder.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"category": "HNF Stories", "description": "Florida lawmakers Friday approved measures that would expand the drug-prescribing powers of advanced registered nurse practitioners and address a", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://health.wusf.usf.edu/post/prescribing-insurance-changes-get-last-minute-approval", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/healthnewsfl/files/styles/medium/public/201301/florida_legislature.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Florida lawmakers Friday approved measures that would expand the drug-prescribing powers of advanced registered nurse practitioners and address a", "title": "Prescribing, Insurance Changes Get Last-Minute Approval"}, "org_id": 0, "twitter": {"site": "@HealthNewsFL", "card": "summary"}, "author": "Jim Saunders of The News Service of Florida", "wordCount": 411, "dc": {"title": "Prescribing, Insurance Changes Get Last-Minute Approval"}, "nid": 13940, "datePublished": "2016-03-14", "story_id": 470362096, "keywords": "Florida Legislature, drug-prescribing powers, advanced registered nurse practitioners, Florida Nurses Association, Florida Legislature 2016, balance billing, surprise billing", "has_audio": 0, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "The drug-prescribing and insurance bills (HB 423 and HB 221) were among the final measures passed during the 60-day session, which ended at 6:45 p.m. Friday.\nSupporters of the legislation say those patients sometimes get unexpected bills because doctors in the hospitals are not part of the insurance plans' networks.\nThe issue centers on patients who have preferred provider organization, or PPO, insurance coverage and go to hospitals for emergency treatment.\nBut the Senate added a late twist to the balance-billing measure when it approved an amendment Friday to require insurance plans to cover such services as speech therapy, occupational therapy and physical therapy for people with Down syndrome.\nThe balance-billing issue also drew intense lobbying during the session, as it affects health insurers, doctors and hospitals."}
