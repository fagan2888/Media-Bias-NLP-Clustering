But when it comes to interpreting between a doctor and patient, the stakes could hardly be higher.\n\nConsider the story of 18-year-old baseball player Willie Ramirez.\n\nOregon certified medical interpreter Helen Eby said Ramirez was taken to a South Florida hospital in a coma. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t able to speak for himself,\u201d Eby said. \u201cHis family apparently used the word \u2018intoxicado\u2019 to talk about this person. Well, \u2018intoxicado\u2019 in Spanish just means that you ingested something. It could be food, it could be a drug, it could be anything that has made you sick.\u201d\n\nBut, Eby continued, \u201cthe interpreter interpreted this as \u2018intoxicated\u2019 so the doctor immediately made a diagnosis of drug overdose. They had him in the hospital for two days before they figured out they should call in a neurologist and found that he had a couple of hematomas in his brain. The guy ended up quadriplegic.\u201d\n\nYou might think nothing like this could happen in Oregon. Thirteen years ago, Oregon passed a bill requiring the use of certified medical interpreters when treating patients who aren\u2019t proficient in English.\n\nBut wages aren\u2019t great and there are fewer than 100 fully-qualified interpreters to cover the whole state.\n\nIsidro Hernandes is 48 and lives in Cornelius. Recently, he was a patient at Hillsboro\u2019s Tuality Hospital. Speaking through an interpreter, who was present in the hospital room, he said he keeps his family fed by working as a landscaper.\u201dOne day I was working and I started to feel a little bit that something was wrong with my heart,\u201d he said. \u201cI began to worry a little bit as I was operating some machinery and I didn\u2019t want anything to happen.\u201d\n\nFor small talk, Hernandez didn\u2019t seem to need an interpreter. But then his doctor, Angela Alday, started asking more complicated questions: \u201cDo you feel like it\u2019s the IV medicine that helps or it\u2019s the pain medicine that helps?\u201d she wanted to know.\n\n\u201cI feel like IV pain medication is more effective because it takes effect quicker,\u201d Hernandes said, again speaking through the interpreter.\n\nTuality Hospital has been using a phone service to provide qualified interpreters. But the director of corporate communications, Gerry Ewing, said they\u2019re planning to use more in-person interpreters.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to reflect the demographics of our community, which is changing rapidly,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWashington County is around 25 percent Hispanic, so we need to reflect that in the services we provide our patients.\u201d\n\nThe interpreter on duty in Hernandes\u2019 hospital room is Armando Jimenez.\n\nTuality Healthcare/Jeff Schilling\n\nThe hospital paid for him to go through the interpreter certification process. Is he being paid extra for the work?\n\n\u201cNot quite yet,\u201d Jimenez said, adding, \u201cso that\u2019s something that the organization is working on is to create that incentive so that people who are internal and would like to get that professional development would get that incentive to do it.\u201d\n\n\n\nBut what about the patient? What kind of interpreter does Isidro Hernandes prefer?\n\n\u201cA lot of times the over-the-phone interpreter can\u2019t see what you\u2019re doing, can\u2019t describe or relay that message. And sometimes they might have errors or mistakes in communications,\u201d Hernandes said.\n\nTuality Hospital is ahead of the pack when it comes to using in-person medical interpreters, said Helen Eby. She\u2019s the president of the Oregon Society of Translators and Interpreters.\n\nShe said that despite Oregon\u2019s requirement for medical interpreters, many hospitals and doctors\u2019 offices still rely on family members.\n\n\u201cYou know, you\u2019ve got a 10-year-old in a gynecology appointment. Is this where you would normally take a 10-year-old? Not likely,\u201d she said.\n\nShe continued: \u201cOr have a child, an adult child even, interpret a parent\u2019s cancer diagnosis. That\u2019s got to be highly traumatic. I mean, I had to interpret as a professional a \u201cdo not resuscitate\u201d appointment. I can\u2019t imagine having to do that for a family member. It was really hard as a professional.\u201d\n\nHernandes\u2019 doctor, Angela Alday, said that five to 20 percent of her patients require an interpreter. She said the hospital encourages her to use a phone service when necessary, which she does. But she said sometimes, when dealing with a touchy issue, she\u2019ll use a family member.\n\n\u201cOne problem that I run into the with the translator phone is a lot of our elderly patients seem to be kind of confused by it,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cYou know some of them don\u2019t hear very well so that can be a problem with the phone translator. And then, particularly if the patient has dementia, sometimes using the telephone translator is confusing. They don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on. But I feel like if there\u2019s a family member standing there beside them, then they understand more what\u2019s happening.\u201d\n\nShe\u2019s pleased the hospital is planning to use more in-person interpreters in the future.\n\nOregon has about 3,500 medical interpreters. But Eby said only 32 are certified and another 64 qualified, \u201cSo you have a three percent chance of getting a qualified or certified interpreter in Oregon right now,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s pretty low, in my opinion.\u201d\n\nA study by the American College of Emergency Physicians in 2012 looked at interpreter errors.\n\nIt found that the error rate was significantly lower for professional interpreters than for ad hoc interpreters \u2014 12 percent as opposed to 22 percent. And for professionals with more than 100 hours of training, errors dropped to 2 percent.\n\nEby said that now the Affordable Care Act is penalizing hospitals for readmissions, such a reduction in errors could save them significant sums.\n\nShe said the lack of certified interpreters is a result of several issues: the wages are low and the state doesn\u2019t have an effective system for providing a ready supply.\n\nTricia Tillman is the director of Oregon\u2019s Office of Equity and Inclusion. She said her agency has seen some gains in the number of interpreters over the past few years, but levels are not where she\u2019d like them to be.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been able to work with a number of training sites to put trainings in place, both on line and in person,\u201d she said. \u201cThere was also some challenge in getting certification programs established in the languages that we have, so now we have seven languages for which certification is possible.\u201d\n\n\n\nTillman hopes new training efforts will help 150 interpreters become newly qualified in Oregon over the next couple of years.", "article_metadata": {"author": "Kristian Foden-Vencil", "og": {"url": "http://www.opb.org/news/article/oregon-has-a-shortage-of-certified-medical-interpreters/", "image": "http://www.opb.org/images/upload/c_fill,h_300,q_90,w_400/tuality-patient-translation03_10_nikwaz.jpg", "description": "Thirteen years ago, Oregon passed a bill requiring the use of certified medical interpreters when treating patients who aren't proficient in English.\u00a0 But wages aren't great and there are fewer than 100 fully qualified interpreters to cover the whole state.", "title": "Oregon Has A Shortage of Certified Medical Interpreters"}, "twitter": {"description": "<p>Thirteen years ago, Oregon passed a bill requiring the use of certified medical interpreters when treating patients who aren't proficient in English.&nbsp; But there are fewer than 100 fully qualified interpreters to cover the state.</p>", "title": "Oregon Has A Shortage Of Certified Medical Interpreters", "image": {"src": "http://www.opb.org/images/upload/c_fill,h_348,q_90,w_620/tuality-patient-translation03_10_nikwaz.jpg"}, "creator": "@OPB", "site": "@OPB", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "org_id": "OPB", "fb": {"pages": 17790154938}, "google-site-verification": "KMaJ_LFRGDv_xknYuKImf3uF3H8gkUuIblN-HIVIjAM", "sniply-options": "block", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Thirteen years ago, Oregon passed a bill requiring the use of certified medical interpreters when treating patients who aren\u2019t proficient in English.\nOregon certified medical interpreter Helen Eby said Ramirez was taken to a South Florida hospital in a coma.\nOregon has about 3,500 medical interpreters.\nShe said that despite Oregon\u2019s requirement for medical interpreters, many hospitals and doctors\u2019 offices still rely on family members.\nShe said the lack of certified interpreters is a result of several issues: the wages are low and the state doesn\u2019t have an effective system for providing a ready supply."}
