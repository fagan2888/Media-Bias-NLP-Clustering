But her recent appearance on Jon Stewart\u2019s show on Comedy Central went about as well as ObamaCare\u2019s train wreck of a rollout.\n\nStewart hammered her and ObamaCare, as we have, on why she and President Obama granted delays for employers and insurers in their mandates, while individuals were still being forced into the comedy central known as the ObamaCare exchanges.\n\nFailing to get a straight answer, Stewart pointed out that businesses are basing hiring decisions now based on ObamaCare\u2019s expensive regulatory straightjacket. He noted that businesses are cutting worker hours to exploit a loophole in the law, but Sebelius denied it.\n\nThen in a moment of intended sarcasm that was really one of unintentional honesty, the U.S. secretary of health and human services said, \u201cAs you know, we\u2019re facing the end of the Western Civilization by having a market-based strategy. We are bringing Western Civilization to its knees by selling private insurance plans on a website where people can pick and choose.\u201d\n\nPeople have long been able to buy insurance online and free to choose which insurance to buy and from whom or not to buy any at all. By forcing people to buy a product they don\u2019t want, Sebelius and the Obama administration are bringing Western civilization to its knees \u2014 at least our Constitution-based part of it.\n\nObamaCare limits our choices and freedom. A true market-based strategy would let people save money tax-free in medical savings accounts and use that money to choose their doctor and buy insurance tailored to their needs, with companies competing for their business across state lines. No mandates, no bureaucrats.\n\nBut then ObamaCare has never been about health care. It\u2019s been about power, as IRS target Dr. Ben Carson made clear Friday at the Values Voter Summit in Washington, D.C. The former Johns Hopkins neurosurgeon called the Affordable Care Act the \u201cworst thing that has happened in this nation since slavery.\u201d\n\nHe wasn\u2019t exaggerating.\n\nObamaCare puts the U.S. government in charge of fully one-sixth of America\u2019s economy, unconstitutionally seeks to force Americans to buy a service, often against their will, and places each individual\u2019s health at the eventual mercy of government bureaucracy.\n\nObamaCare\u2019s power to tax is the power to destroy our free-market economy \u2014 and our freedoms, as well.\n\nSo Sebelius is right after all. ObamaCare, as the song goes, is the end of the world as we know it.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Health Care: In a stunning admission, our Health and Human Services secretary admits ObamaCare is part of the fundamental transformation of America away from a", "og": {"site_name": "Investor's Business Daily", "description": "Health Care: In a stunning admission, our Health and Human Services secretary admits ObamaCare is part of the fundamental transformation of America away from a free market in anything to a nanny st\u2026", "title": "Sebelius: ObamaCare To Bring \u2018Western Civilization To Its Knees\u2019", "url": "http://www.investors.com/politics/obamacare/obamacare-bringing-western-civilization-to-its-knees/", "image": {"width": 512, "identifier": "http://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-ibd-favicon-v7.png", "height": 512}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary", "creator": "@IBDInvestors"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-ibd-favicon-v7-270x270.png", "date": "2013-10-14 15:58:00:-08:00", "article": {"published_time": "2013-10-14T15:58:00+00:00", "modified_time": "-001-11-30T00:00:00+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd797b\"", "article_summary": "By forcing people to buy a product they don\u2019t want, Sebelius and the Obama administration are bringing Western civilization to its knees \u2014 at least our Constitution-based part of it.\nBut then ObamaCare has never been about health care.\nWe are bringing Western Civilization to its knees by selling private insurance plans on a website where people can pick and choose.\u201dPeople have long been able to buy insurance online and free to choose which insurance to buy and from whom or not to buy any at all.\nHe noted that businesses are cutting worker hours to exploit a loophole in the law, but Sebelius denied it.\nHealth Care: In a stunning admission, our Health and Human Services secretary admits ObamaCare is part of the fundamental transformation of America away from a free market in anything to a nanny state on steroids."}
