They've also opened up a big pipeline for provider systems that offer their own health plans.Indiana University Health recorded a big jump in premium revenue from its insurance arm in the first half of 2015, the first year IU Health started selling plans on Indiana's federally operated exchange. The Indianapolis-based system said in a bondholder document that the ACA policies \u201cas well as more members in both Medicaid and Medicare programs\u201d led to the surge in premiums.Republican Indiana Gov. Mike Pence expanded Medicaid this year to low-income people who earn up to 138% of the federal poverty level.

Medicare Advantage continues to enroll more seniors, and the private program now enrolls 17.6 million people nationwide, according to August figures from the CMS.The influx of people with exchange, Medicaid and Medicare Advantage coverage pushed up IU Health's premium revenue by 70% year over year, from $114.8 million in the first six months of 2014 to $195.7 million in the first half of this year. However, the health system did not disclose how profitable its health plans were.

That was down from its 13.7% margin on $2.8 billion of revenue in the same period a year ago.
