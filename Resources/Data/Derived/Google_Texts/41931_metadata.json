The flexible payment option, available March 1, 2015, allows Summit Health patients to pay their balances in manageable monthly installments at 0.00% APR for the life of the account. There are no hidden fees or applications and no impact on credit reports.\n\n\u201cPatients are becoming healthcare consumers,\u201d says Kimberly Rzomp, Vice President and Chief Financial Officer for Summit Health. \u201cThey\u2019re asking about pricing and payment plans because higher insurance deductibles and co-pays are driving up their share of medical costs. CarePayment\u2019s program helps us deliver an important benefit to our neighbors. We\u2019re making it easier for patients to get care and pay for it.\u201d\n\nAccording to Rzomp, Summit Health also has financial counselors at both Chambersburg Hospital and Waynesboro Hospital that are trained as Certified Application Counselors (CACs) to help patients as part of the Affordable Care Act apply for health coverage on the federal insurance exchange. Financial counselors also help with determining appropriate government assistance programs and applications.\n\nRising health insurance premiums and out-of-pocket costs are pushing people into tough decisions that could have serious health consequences. A recent Commonwealth Fund report found that four in 10 working-age adults delayed or avoided needed care due to high deductible health plans.\n\n\u201cThe CarePayment program means patients don\u2019t have to make such difficult choices,\u201d notes Rzomp. \u201cManaging their expenses over time gives patients peace of mind. They can add other approved hospital costs to the CarePayment account, which is a flexible, open-end line of credit. The financing program also offers great flexibility in how patients manage their accounts, including automatic payments, mobile and online account access, and paper or electronic statements.\u201d\n\n\u201cWith CarePayment, Summit Health removes a troubling barrier to care,\u201d says Craig Hodges, CEO of CarePayment. \u201cSummit\u2019s investments in pricing transparency and quality, supported by our affordable financing program for patients, speaks to Summit Health\u2019s commitment to caring for its community, patient satisfaction and added value.\u201d\n\nFor more information, please call Chambersburg Hospital Patient Accounting at (717) 267-7129 or Waynesboro Hospital Patient Accounting at (717) 765-3406 to find out more about this affordable financing option.\n\nAbout Summit Health\n\nSummit Health is a non-profit network of hospitals and physician practices dedicated to building a healthier community.
