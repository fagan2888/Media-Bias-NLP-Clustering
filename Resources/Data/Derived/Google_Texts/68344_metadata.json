But targeting Jews everywhere for what Israel allegedly does is anti-Semitism.\n\nShe alleged that Israel was committing an ongoing holocaust of the Palestinian people. The analogy is false and defamatory. The charge implicitly likens Israelis to Nazis. Demonization of Israel is not criticism of Israel\u2019s policies. It is anti-Semitism.\n\nLewis further implied that Jews were blocking the commemoration of genocides other than that of the Holocaust. This is not true.\n\nIowa-MFSA was alerted in advance about Lewis\u2019 remarks as was Iowa Methodist Bishop Julius C. Trimble. Bishop Trimble, in a letter now online at http://bit.ly/1ELxSRK rebuked the anti-Semitism. By contrast, in a letter dated June 3, I-MFSA irresponsibly evaded the issue.\n\nThis is not about I-MFSA\u2019s point of view on the Middle East conflict. It is solely about anti-Semitism, which cannot legitimately be used to further a political agenda. I-MFSA must repudiate the anti-Semitism of the keynote speaker. Until they do, the moral character of their organization will remain blemished, their silence passively abetting the promotion of anti-Semitism.\n\nIt is often said that \u201cAll that is necessary for evil to prevail is for good people to do nothing.\u201d We call upon the I-MFSA and its supporters to now do the right thing.\n\n\u2014 Mark Finkelstein, Jewish Federation of Greater Des Moines, and signed by all local congregational rabbis and presidents\n\nRead or Share this story: http://dmreg.co/1MmZG4B", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Missionary targets Jews everywhere for Israeli actions", "p": {"domain_verify": "372c291dc2b106308d26264f4fba3b10"}, "og": {"site_name": "Des Moines Register", "description": "Missionary targets Jews everywhere for Israeli actions", "title": "Methodist group must repudiate anti-Semitism", "url": "http://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/opinion/columnists/iowa-view/2015/06/10/methodist-group-must-repudiate-anti-semitism/28778219/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/desmoinesregister.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Missionary targets Jews everywhere for Israeli actions", "title": "Methodist group must repudiate anti-Semitism", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/a032733674bb3242890ce22812214f6584dfa43c/c=300-0-1140-840&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/06/09/DesMoines/B9317669191Z.1_20150609235115_000_G0HB180N4.1-0.jpg", "creator": "@DMRegister", "site": "@DMRegister", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600025120", "fb": {"app_id": 169766623060429}, "viewport": "width=1070", "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "cXenseParse": {"recs": {"category": "opinion/columnists/iowa-view", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/e26cfb82badd8e84cd9db68bc780c54591f1861e/c=405-0-1035-840/local/-/media/2015/06/09/DesMoines/B9317669191Z.1_20150609235115_000_G0HB180N4.1-0.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/dac7d256a59f84940e502b66fdba9c9126e1eda5/c=300-0-1140-840/local/-/media/2015/06/09/DesMoines/B9317669191Z.1_20150609235115_000_G0HB180N4.1-0.jpg", "contenttype": "data", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/ea01a6a00dbd2496de65f37025887b7eaa790f77/c=160-0-1280-840/local/-/media/2015/06/09/DesMoines/B9317669191Z.1_20150609235115_000_G0HB180N4.1-0.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/bd64435675ed77d92ee7226039c86a4975acbcd1/c=0-15-1440-825&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/2015/06/09/DesMoines/B9317669191Z.1_20150609235115_000_G0HB180N4.1-0.jpg", "publishtime": "2015-06-09T23:23:14.650000-05:00", "shorthed": "Methodist group must repudiate anti-Semitism", "articleid": 28778219, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/cf590beeec04e793cbf8e7ec6bbd1a1289afc9ba/c=0-15-1440-825/local/-/media/2015/06/09/DesMoines/B9317669191Z.1_20150609235115_000_G0HB180N4.1-0.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/2a7e9250d0c4461d31b889d1561416dbe34fc853/c=484-0-956-840/local/-/media/2015/06/09/DesMoines/B9317669191Z.1_20150609235115_000_G0HB180N4.1-0.jpg"}, "gci-asset-type": "data", "title": "Methodist group must repudiate anti-Semitism", "pageclass": "article", "author": "Mark Finkelstein"}}, "article_summary": "I-MFSA must repudiate the anti-Semitism of the keynote speaker.\nJanet Lahr Lewis, a missionary with the Board of Global Ministries of the United Methodist Church, was keynote speaker for the I-MFSA program held in conjunction with the Annual Conference of the United Methodist Church in Des Moines.\nUntil they do, the moral character of their organization will remain blemished, their silence passively abetting the promotion of anti-Semitism.\nIowa-MFSA was alerted in advance about Lewis\u2019 remarks as was Iowa Methodist Bishop Julius C.
