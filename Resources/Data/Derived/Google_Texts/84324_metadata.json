The trumpeter, who\u2019s at home in every configuration from intimate combo to symphonic orchestra, leads his trio, with downbeat time set at 8:30 for both concerts in the club at 85 Lyme St. He\u2019s joined by his longtime collaborators bassist Vincente Archer and drummer Marcus Gilmore, a tight, interactive trio that can generate more ideas and even a bigger sound than big bands six times its size. Doors open at 7:30 pm. Tickets: $35. Information: sidedoorjazz.com and (860) 434-0886.\n\nPlaying it safe isn\u2019t an option for Payton, even though success did come early and amply to him with a winning string of acclaimed albums on Verve in the 1990s, beginning with From This Moment On and including his Grammy award-winning collaboration with the venerable trumpeter Doc Cheatham, entitled Doc Cheatham & Nicholas Payton.\n\nAlong with his obvious musical gifts, Payton\u2019s artistic and personal DNA also comes complete with a restless, powerful creative urge to keep evolving, to keep striving after some increasingly higher standard, some new, utopian Payton Place waiting to be developed. It\u2019s a quest that, apparently, is never satisfied.\n\nA personal holy grail, it demands that, as a musician, he must always be challenged by something new. As a writer, he must always challenge too easily-accepted social beliefs and pop pieties, especially those rooted in falsehoods, pandering commercialism, or media hype. It doesn't matter whether he\u2019s commenting on a phenomenon as ephemeral as pop figure Miley Cyrus, or a topic as substantial as United States foreign policy for being overly aggressive, or President Obama for being overly cautious about rectifying social ills and injustices here at home.\n\nAlong with Payton's intellectual critical traits, which he can express with articulate ferocity, comes his respect for the past, a love for elders, a reverence for ancestry, an awareness of and an appreciation of tradition tempered by his existential urge to be creative in the present moment, while simultaneously keeping his eye on the future. That kind of Janus-like vision -- one that exists in the present while simultaneously looking to both the past and the future -- tolerates neither aesthetic fakery nor such social ills as racism or sexism, and eviscerates them all verbally.\n\nA man of many parts, the now 40-year-old, one-time New Orleans wunderkind is not just a trumpet titan, nor just yet another superstar rising from the Crescent City. He\u2019s all that, but also a master juggler of a dazzling array of pursuits and interests.\n\nAmong his recent major triumphs dating from 2012, for example, is his ambitious, full orchestral work, The Black American Symphony, and his remarkable live concert performance and original, contemporary take on the iconic Miles Davis/Gil Evans collaboration, Sketches of Spain.\n\nPayton performed Sketches with a 19-piece ensemble comprised of 15 brass and woodwinds and even a harpist, all tapped from the Swiss Sinfonieorchester Basel under the baton of conductor Dennis Russell Davies. His Side Door trio mates, Archer and Gilmore, plus percussionist Daniel Sadownick, also accompanied him on that demanding venture. This was an especially risky giant step, since he dared to reinterpret a sacred text in the jazz canon, a hallowed work not open to revisionist exegesis. That same year, Payton, who\u2019s also an exemplary businessman, somehow also managed to launch his own label, BMF Records, with the release of his steaming album, #BAM Live at the Bohemian Caverns.\n\nA brilliant multi-instrumentalis, in a classic act of Paytonic prestidigitation he can simultaneously solo on trumpet while backing himself on Fender Rhodes, he\u2019s also a composer, arranger, singer, bandleader, arch enemy of musical clich\u00e9s, and verbal scourge of historical platitudes and racist myths.\n\nPayton is a take-no-prisoner blogger who can enrage or enlighten, as he did a couple years ago with a bombshell blog manifesto in which he declared, ex cathedra, that jazz died in 1959. \"Jazz is a label that was forced on the musicians,\" he wrote. \"The musicians should\u2019ve never accepted that idea,\" he added, assailing the history of the use and abuse of the word jazz itself. Not only is jazz a patronizing word of unsavory, racist origin, he asserted, but also one that historically has been employed as a repressive tool to exploit the black creators of the music, which he prefers to call Black American Music. \"Jazz is a marketing ploy that serves an elite few,\" he wrote. \"It\u2019s a marketing idea. Jazz is a brand. Jazz ain\u2019t music, it\u2019s marketing and bad marketing at that.\"\n\nIn the bold critical tradition of other great dissenting figures such as Charles Mingus, Max Roach, and Archie Shepp, Payton speaks his mind in a sharp, candid way, very much in the classic American grain of literary protest. At times, his words are reminiscent of the scathing social commentary that the late, great African-American writer/critic Amiri Baraka infused so powerfully into his essays on black music. Baraka's bombshells of several decades ago also disturbed and enraged some readers, while, no doubt, inspiring others with their fresh, incendiary perspectives on cultural history.\n\nPutting his sharp pen aside, Payton, with a a little bit of help from his two eloquent friends, Archer and Gilmore, speaks volumes of musical wisdom with his trumpet this weekend at the Side Door Jazz Club, which has swung open a whole new vista for all fans within driving distance of the bustling shoreline jazz mecca.\n\nHazeltine Time at Yale\n\nYale School of Music Professor Willie Ruff, the noted music maven, founder, artistic director and eminence grise behind Yale\u2019s distinguished Ellington Jazz Series, regularly presents a wide spectrum of premier jazz stylists without compromising Duke Ellington\u2019s personal credo that the art of swing is an eternal verity for the music. Right in line with Duke\u2019s pre post-modernist aesthetic of the meaning of soul, grit and groove is the hard-swinging, deeply expressive modern jazz pianist David Hazeltine, who leads his trio at 8:00 pm Thursday, January 16, at the series\u2019 classy roost in Morse Recital Hall at Sprague Hall, 470 College Street in New Haven.\n\nIf you love Cedar Walton and Tommy Flanagan, you\u2019re sure to dig Hazeltine, a charter member of One for All, the blue-ribbon, hard bop sextet featuring, among other worthies, West Hartford\u2019s Steve Davis on trombone. Hazeltine is joined by two superb, simpatico swingers, the redoubtable double bassist George Mraz, who doubles on alto saxophone, and drummer Billy Drummond. Tickets start at $20; $10 with student ID. Box office: (203) 432-4158.\n\nInnovative String Theoretician\n\nMichael Coppola, a virtuoso guitarist and innovative guitar designer, performs on his celebrated nine-string Hydra guitar at 8:00 pm Saturday, January 18, for the Connecticut Guitar Society at Asylum Hill Congregational Church, 814 Asylum Avenue in Hartford.\n\nBesides basking in ovations at national guitar shows, Coppola\u2019s many noted performances include appearances at the Montreal Jazz Festival, New York\u2019s Blue Note and The Iridium (as a guest of guitar god Les Paul), and at the National Guitar Museum, where he jammed in duos with the likes of Gene Bertoncini and Howard Alden. Tickets: $20, general admission; $15, CGS members. Information: ctguitar.org and (860) 249-1132.\n\nMaxine Martin\u2019s Musical Mosaic\n\nCelebrating her recent album, Fragments and Colors of Me, singer/songwriter, tenor saxophonist and clarinetist Maxine Carol Martin displays her wide-ranging talents at 3:00 pm Sunday, January 19, in the free Baby Grand Jazz series at the Hartford Public Library, 500 Main Street.\n\nFeaturing eleven original selections, including the title track, among her disc\u2019s dozen diverse pieces, \u201cFragments\u201d is a mosaic of the Hartford-based artist\u2019s personal muse and reflective, spirited, sometimes spiritual views on life. Her first-rate supporting cast features such Nutmeg notables as pianist Warren Byrd, bassist Sinan Bakir, bassist Matt Dwonszyk and drummer Cemre Dogan.\n\nMartin, who grew up in Connecticut, lived and worked for more than 20 productive years in New York City where she was an active member of International Woman of Jazz, performing with such noted IWJ members as the heroically pioneering woman jazz bassist/vocalist Carline Ray and vocalists Lenora Zenzalai Helm and Judi Silvano. While performing and teaching in the Big Apple, Martin appeared at such venues as The Bitter End, The Nuyorican Poet\u2019s Caf\u00e9 and Harlem\u2019s historic Lenox Lounge, and with such noted musicians as drummer Charli Persip.\n\nMartin earned her BA in music at the University of South Florida, and, while a music education major at the Hartt School at the University of Hartford, audited classes with the celebrated alto saxophonist/educator Jackie McLean and his colleague, saxophonist Paul Jeffries.\n\nMartin, who crosses all genres from jazz and classical to rock and folk, regularly performs throughout the state with the four musicians on her disc, as well as with such Connecticut-based musicians as vocalists Margaux Hayes and Nicki Mathis, percussionist Abu Alvin Carter Sr., drummer Mike Augeri and bassist Paul Fuller. Concert information: hplct.org and (860) 695-6295.\n\nMiracle on Main Street\n\nContinuing in its weekly Sunday role as The Miracle on Main Street, the admission-free Baby Grand Jazz series broke its all-time attendance record January 5 as a crowd of 600 packed the Hartford Public Library to hear violin virtuoso Meg Okura and a contingent from her Pan Asian Chamber Jazz Ensemble launch the series\u2019 eleventh season in the downtown library\u2019s picturesque atrium.\n\nAlthough turnouts were anemic during Baby Grand\u2019s imperiled infancy and early childhood, over the past few years the now robust series, which runs through April, has seen its attendance figures skyrocket through the atrium ceiling. Last year, the 3:00 pm Sunday matinee series, which featured 16 weekly concerts, drew a record-breaking total of 5,000, a virtually miraculous mega-figure by jazz standards.\n\nDelighted by the huge turnouts, HPL CEO Matt Poland said the series\u2019 soaring figures are \u201ca testament to its tremendous value in our community, and its popularity among fans of great live music from throughout the state.\u201d\n\nIn another groundbreaking innovation for the 2014 season's opening day, the Okura concert was streamed-live into Billings Forge\u2019s Kitchen at HPL\u2019s caf\u00e9 space fronting Main Street. Library spokesperson Rachel Gary observed that overflow concert attendees enjoyed the live-streaming show along with the caf\u00e9\u2019s specialty drinks and baked goods.\n\nFor those who enjoy snacking while savoring steaming jazz, The Kitchen, which is usually closed on weekends, will be open from 2:00 to 5:00 pm on Sundays through January. There\u2019s a possibility that it might extend its special Sunday openings through the end of the series to accommodate the jazz-loving caf\u00e9 society crowd.\n\nCantata Honors Dr. King\n\nIn honor of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Day, the About You Trio presents an original seven-part cantata, whose theme is slavery, at 3:00 pm Saturday, January 18, in yet another free event in HPL\u2019s atrium.\n\nThe work, Living Water, alternates between music and narration as it depicts the bitter struggles of an enslaved African-American mother and her son. Jolie Rocke Brown, the versatile, classically trained diva who easily crosses over from opera to jazz and gospel, is featured both as vocalist and arranger. Her collaborators are Angela D. Griffin, trio founder and flutist, and Laurie J. MacAlpine, composer/arranger and pianist.\n\nDelta Force Takes No Prisoners\n\nFirepower abounds as the fearless trumpeter Josh Evans leads his take-no-prisoners quintet at the \u201cJazz Mondays\u201d series at 8 p.m. Monday, January 20, at Black-eyed Sally\u2019s, 350 Asylum St., Hartford. Evans\u2019 delta strike force team features trombonist Steve Davis, pianist Warren Byrd, bassist Alex Tremblay, and drummer Jonathan Barber. An open jam session follows the first set.
