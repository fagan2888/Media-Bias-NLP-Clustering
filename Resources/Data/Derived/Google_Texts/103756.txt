The Tucson Police Department has identified a man shot by police Saturday, Feb. 13 as Owen Frank Herrera, 28, and the man who shot him as TPD Officer Troy Lansdale, a three-year veteran of the department.

The incident happened in the 100 block of South Bella Vista Drive, near A Mountain, also known as Sentinel Peak.

TPD received a welfare-check call at around 4:30 p.m., according to TPD Sgt. Pete Dugan, a department spokesman. He said the caller reported a man in his late 20s "acting erratically" inside a home.

Lansdale responded to the call and saw Herrera in front of the home armed with a knife, according to police.

"He (Lansdale) immediately began giving commands to that person to drop the knife," Dugan said. "During that altercation, while he was trying to get him to drop the knife, shots were fired."

Herrera was hit several times, and police rendered first aid until an ambulance arrived to transport him to Banner University Medical Center.

Lansdale, who has advanced training in crisis intervention, was not injured, Dugan said.

Herrera is in police custody while in the hospital and will be booked into the Pima County Jail on one charge of aggravated assault on a peace officer with a deadly weapon, according to Dugan.
