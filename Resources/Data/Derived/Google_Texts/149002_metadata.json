And the earlier you attempt to retire, the more challenging it becomes. The main reason is that the sooner you retire, the longer you\u2019ll have to live on your savings and retirement income, subjecting you to a greater risk of running out of money.\n\nAnother reason retiring early can be daunting is maintaining health insurance coverage until Medicare kicks in.\n\nHere\u2019s this week\u2019s question from our forums:\n\nSay you\u2019re in your early 60s, you want to retire and you have enough in your retirement to do so. Where can you get insurance? Will it be too high? Are we all doomed to work until we are 65, or like in my case I think they moved it up to 67, just to have insurance?\n\nBefore we begin, let\u2019s clear up something this reader is confused about. Their question is about finding affordable health insurance should they retire before they\u2019re eligible for Medicare, which kicks in at age 65. That age has not been moved back to 67. What has been moved back for many people, however, is the age at which you become eligible for full retirement benefits from Social Security.\n\nWhen you\u2019re eligible for Social Security depends on when you were born. To see the age when you\u2019ll become eligible for full Social Security benefits, you can check out this calculator.\n\nHow can anyone afford insurance when they retire early?\n\nIt wasn\u2019t long ago that if you were planning to retire before you were eligible for Medicare, you had a big problem.\n\nSay, like most Americans, you got your health insurance through work. If you chose to retire at age 62, the youngest age at which you could receive Social Security, you\u2019d have three years until you turned 65 and became eligible for Medicare. Unless your employer offered health insurance for retirees, you were then faced with two choices: either pay for private health insurance or risk going without.\n\nFor many, paying for private health insurance wasn\u2019t a viable option, for one of two reasons. The first was expense. Because the older you get, the more health insurance costs, the price of private coverage was simply too high. The second was insurability. By the time we reach 62, many of us have developed a health issue that would have rendered us uninsurable. In other words, in the past, insurance companies wouldn\u2019t take you at any price.\n\nResult? Because living without health insurance meant risking one\u2019s entire net worth, people like the reader above were forced to continue working until they turned 65 and were eligible for Medicare.\n\nHappily, however, these impediments to early retirement no longer apply.\n\nHow Obamacare has changed where and how long we work\n\nIf your goal is to get into a heated discussion, the easiest way to do it is to say the word Obamacare. Think I\u2019m exaggerating? Read the comments on stories like Why I\u2019m Republican and Love Obamacare or 8 Steps to Prepare for Obamacare. Or check out a 2015 Fox News poll, which suggests three-quarters of Republicans think Obamacare will ultimately be a bad thing and three-quarters of Democrats think the opposite.\n\nPretty divisive stuff.\n\nBut when it comes to the Affordable Care Act, there\u2019s one thing that\u2019s tough to argue. Obamacare has given Americans flexibility they\u2019ve never known. That\u2019s because of two key features: You can\u2019t be turned down, and if you qualify, Uncle Sam helps pay the tab.\n\nBecause you\u2019re now guaranteed coverage, those who were uninsurable are no longer tied to a job simply to maintain insurance. And because you may qualify for a subsidy, you\u2019re now able to leave a big company and strike out on your own.\n\nAnd salient to this discussion, should you wish to retire early, you may now do so and rest assured you\u2019ll be able to find affordable coverage until you reach 65.\n\nHere\u2019s an example: Me\n\nTo illustrate how Obamacare can help our reader with early retirement, I went to healthcare.gov and scoped out the possibilities, using myself as an example.\n\nI\u2019ll be 60 tomorrow, so I\u2019m a likely prospect to retire early. In addition to my age, I told Healthcare.gov that I\u2019m a Florida resident and earn about $30,000 per year.\n\nThe result? For the cheapest plan, the subsidized cost would be $79 per month for a policy with a $6,300 deductible.\n\nI can also use myself as an example to what life was like before Obamacare. For the last few years, I\u2019ve been covered by my wife\u2019s work-related policy. But before that, because I\u2019m self-employed, I paid the entire cost of my heath insurance. I just went back and looked: In August 2012, when I was 57, I was paying $693.04 monthly for a policy with a $6,000 deductible. And since that policy increased in price every year, you can bet I would have been paying way more than $700 monthly by now.\n\nWithout the subsidy and competition offered by Obamacare, retiring early for my hypothetical self would likely have proved impossible. It wouldn\u2019t be easy to pay nearly 30 percent of my monthly income for health insurance. And keep in mind, I\u2019m healthy. If I had any number of ailments that could have rendered me uninsurable, I wouldn\u2019t have been able to get coverage at all. I would have been in the exact situation our reader is afraid of: forced to work until I\u2019m 65 and Medicare eligible, or forced to retire without insurance and risk my life savings in the event of a serious illness.\n\nWe don\u2019t know whether our reader is a supporter or detractor of Obamacare. But we can guess that after reading this, they\u2019ll soon be able to retire and think about it for as long as they choose.\n\nGot a question you\u2019d like answered?\n\nA great way to get answers to just about any money-related question is to head to our Forums.
