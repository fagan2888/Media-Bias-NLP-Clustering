With the nine-hour interrogation of bit player Sid Blumenthal Tuesday, they jumped the shark. The House Select Committee on Benghazi deposed the Clinton confidant in a closed hearing room in a sub-basement of the Capitol. Blumenthal\u2019s never been to Libya. He doesn\u2019t know anything special about the Benghazi attack. He did sometimes forward \"intelligence\" memos from an ex-CIA officer to his longtime friend Hillary Clinton. Not surprisingly, the committee \u2014 tasked with investigating the Benghazi assault \u2014 learned absolutely nothing from Blumenthal about the terrorist attack that killed four Americans, including Ambassador Chris Stevens, in September 2012. However, by spending all that time on Blumenthal, they met someone who does know something about Hillary Clinton. Indeed, Blumenthal\u2019s appearance on Capitol Hill \u2014 where he was last a prominent figure during Bill Clinton\u2019s impeachment saga \u2014 felt like part of a national time warp in which Americans are forced to relive the partisan warfare of the 1990s, when Republicans summoned Clinton aides to testify about an endless string of investigations. A Clinton confidant testifying before Congress is the only thing more '90s than a Bush and a Clinton running for president.\n\nApparently the questioning of Blumenthal was so transparently aimed at gathering campaign material against Hillary that Democrats on the committee want the full transcript released. They probably also want it released because Republicans in the past have had a bad habit of selectively releasing tiny little parts of transcripts purpose-designed to make Democrats look bad.1 Best to nip that in the bud.\n\nThere are so many things that I thought Republicans would eventually calm down about. Obamacare. Benghazi. Climate change. Iraq. Putin. Obama's betrayal of Israel. But no. Granted, campaign season is upon us, and that's when things always get hot, but still. Benghazi? Seriously? How many metric tons of evidence does it take for them to admit that it was a tragedy but not an act of treason?\n\n1Though, in fairness, I don't think Gowdy has ever done this.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "Mother Jones Magazine", "og": {"url": "http://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2015/06/benghazi-hearings-now-trip-down-memory-lane", "site_name": "Mother Jones", "image": "/sites/all/assets/mojo_nomaster.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "Benghazi hearings now a trip down memory lane"}, "twitter": {"title": "Benghazi hearings now a trip down memory lane", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2015/06/benghazi-hearings-now-trip-down-memory-lane", "image": {"src": "/sites/all/assets/mojo_nomaster.jpg", "identifier": "/sites/all/assets/mojo_nomaster.jpg"}, "creator": "kdrum", "site": "@MotherJones", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "/sites/all/assets/mstile-70x70.png", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "/sites/all/assets/mstile-310x310.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "/sites/all/assets/mstile-310x150.png", "fb": {"admins": "13301307,670317733,1198876232,38509772,106892,2907757,306289,602422192,4101301,513450539"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/sites/all/assets/mstile-144x144.png", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "/sites/all/assets/mstile-150x150.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3a19\"", "article_summary": "hearings:Republicans finally stripped away any pretense that they are more interested in the Benghazi attack than in attacking Hillary Clinton.\nHe did sometimes forward \"intelligence\" memos from an ex-CIA officer to his longtime friend Hillary Clinton.\nThe House Select Committee on Benghazi deposed the Clinton confidant in a closed hearing room in a sub-basement of the Capitol.\nHe doesn\u2019t know anything special about the Benghazi attack.\nHowever, by spending all that time on Blumenthal, they met someone who does know something about Hillary Clinton."}
