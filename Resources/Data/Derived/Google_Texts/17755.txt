Seitz tweeted that there were 500 people there.

"An honor to share their cross!" Seitz tweeted.

This past summer, Seitz became one of the national faces of the U.S. immigration debate, testifying before a congressional committee.

In July, Seitz wrote a post on his blog explaining the Roman Catholic church's stance when it comes to immigrants. Read part of the post below.

"Those who have known me through the years have known that I believe and am willing to defend all that the Catholic Church teaches, whether in her doctrinal or social teaching. But the issue that has always been closest to my heart, the concern that most passionately moves me to action, is the defense of the life of the unborn. While I feel tremendous compassion and sympathy for the woman who finds herself to be expecting a child in a difficult situation, I see the assault on the life of the innocent unborn child as the most egregious attack on the dignity of the human person imaginable."
