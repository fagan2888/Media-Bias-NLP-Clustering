He hit four three-pointers, including two in the final 2:05.\n\n\"Shooters shoot,\" Collingswood coach Pat Dorney said of Mann-Barnes, the brother of former Colls star Tyrone Mann-Barnes, now a senior at the University of the Sciences.\n\nWallace added 10 points along with seven rebounds and three assists and Malik Muhammad bounced off the bench to score eight for Collingswood (4-0).\n\nJustin Hansen scored 14 with five assists and five rebounds and Tyler Leonhardt scored 13 for West Deptford (4-1).\n\nHansen and Leonhardt led the way as West Deptford outscored Collingswood, 17-1, in the final seven minutes of the third quarter to take a 41-36 lead heading into the fourth.\n\nThe Eagles still led by five when Mann-Barnes hit a three-pointer from the corner to cut the deficit to 49-47 with 2:05 remaining in the game.\n\nBoth teams missed opportunities over the last two minutes. West Deptford missed the front end of a one-and-one with 0:16 on the clock.\n\nCollingswood raced down court and Mann-Barnes missed a three-point attempt from the corner.\n\nBut Wallace corralled the rebound, took his time and shovelled a pass to Mann-Barnes, who rose up from deep behind the three-point line to the right of the key.\n\nThe shot hit nothing but net as the buzzer sounded and Collingswood students raced out of the stands and buried Mann-Barnes in the bottom of a dogpile at midcourt.\n\n\"I'll never forget that,\" Mann-Barnes said.\n\nWest Deptford 7 17 17 8 -- 49\n\nCollingswood 12 21 3 14 -- 50\n\nWD: Preston Harcum 6, Justin Hansen 14, Mike Gardner 8, Tyler Leonhard 13, Marquise Owens 8.\n\nC: Tyree Mann-Barnes 16, Jordan Wallace 10, Isaac Destin 3, Steve Earl 7, Malik Muhammad 8, Ibraham Kargbo 6.\n\n-- Contact Phil Anastasia at panastasia@phillynews.com\n\n-- Follow @PhilAnastasia on Twitter\n\nPublished: The Philadelphia Inquirer\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.", "article_metadata": {"byline": "Phil Anastasia", "contenttype": "Blog_Post", "publication": "Philadelphia Inquirer", "pubdate": 20160527, "title": "Basketball: Colls stun West Deptford on Mann-Barnes' buzzer beater", "og": {"url": "http://www.philly.com/philly/blogs/238721222.html", "type": "article", "image": "http://media.philly.com/images/mannbarnes.jpg", "site_name": "Philly.com", "title": "Basketball: Colls stun West Deptford on Mann-Barnes' buzzer beater"}, "contentid": 238721222, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.philly.com/philly/blogs/238721222.html", "image": "http://media.philly.com/images/mannbarnes.jpg", "site": "@phillydotcom", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Basketball: Colls stun West Deptford on Mann-Barnes' buzzer beater"}, "cg": "news", "fb": {"app_id": 938226082960499}, "DC.date.issued": "2014-01-04T11:30:01-04:00", "editdate": "20140104T11:30:01", "searchdate": "2014-01-04", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "keywords": "Phil Anastasia", "google-site-verification": "db3T5L3C8_JvO-55gJ22lGGUnZLlNulgzTwX1NhCV3o", "verify-v1": "3x82DC93LZlv0I/hQEBoyVVjlGPtX7VxHFgv1upr+9I=", "y_key": "ccf0cd67e5f1e33c", "livedate": "20140104T11:30:01", "sourcepublication": "Inquirer", "news_keywords": "Phil Anastasia"}, "article_summary": "West Deptford missed the front end of a one-and-one with 0:16 on the clock.\nJustin Hansen scored 14 with five assists and five rebounds and Tyler Leonhardt scored 13 for West Deptford (4-1).\nWest Deptford 7 17 17 8 -- 49Collingswood 12 21 3 14 -- 50WD: Preston Harcum 6, Justin Hansen 14, Mike Gardner 8, Tyler Leonhard 13, Marquise Owens 8.\nBut Collingswood's Jordan Wallace grabbed the rebound and got the basketball back to Mann-Barnes, who buried a 25-footer at the buzzer to lift the Panthers to a 50-49 victory over West Deptford in a Colonial Liberty game on Saturday.\nCollingswood raced down court and Mann-Barnes missed a three-point attempt from the corner."}
