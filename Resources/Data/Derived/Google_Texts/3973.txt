The U.S. Department of Labor is ramping up its oversight of the multiple employer welfare arrangement industry.

The agency posted a notice on its site recently that emphasized new rules that apply to the MEWAs. It used the “news” that new 2013 Form 5500s would be available for review only on its Employee Benefits Security Administration page to raise the MEWA regulatory issue.
