Sallie Mae, a financial services company, is reporting that Americans are borrowing less and paying more out of pocket for college. USA today reports:

Sarah Ducich, a senior vice president at Sallie Mae and a co-author of the report by Ipsos Public Affairs, said tuition is rising but parents are keeping college spending nearly constant by cutting costs of things like housing and textbooks.

The article continues:

Ducich said Americans overwhelmingly agree that college is a good investment. This year, eight out of 10 families said they were willing to stretch financially to pay for college. "They are very resilient and clever and determined to make college work," Ducich said. "We can have a lot of policy debates in Washington, but families are finding ways."

While college remains a priority for many Americans, many jobs that do not require a four year degree are left unfilled. Reason TV spoke with Mike Rowe last year about the high cost of college, and how he believes it's not worth it for everybody. "Dirty Jobs' Mike Rowe on the High Cost of College," produced by Nick Gillespie and Meredith Bragg. About 40 minutes.
