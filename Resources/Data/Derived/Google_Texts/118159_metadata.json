Tsakopoulos, Demos has reported that his personal assets jumped from less than $365,000 to as much as $5 million.\n\nThat infusion of cash gives Demos a decided financial edge over both state Sen. Lee Zeldin (R-Shirley) and the man they want to beat, Rep. Tim Bishop (D-Southampton). Zeldin has $307,315 in cash and Bishop has $565,456 in the bank.\n\nYet Demos' new fortune has strings attached by campaign finance law. And it's a target for Zeldin, who criticizes Demos for taking money from a major fundraiser for Bill and Hillary Rodham Clinton and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.).\n\nDemos declined to be interviewed for this article.\n\nadvertisement | advertise on newsday\n\n\"George Demos is running for Congress, not his family,\" said his campaign spokesman, Kevin Tschirhart.\n\nDemos, 37, is a former Securities and Exchange Commission lawyer who gained notice as an advocate for the rebuilding of St. Nicholas Greek Orthodox Church in Manhattan, which was destroyed by the 9/11 terror attacks.\n\nIn 2010, he finished second out of three candidates in an open GOP primary. But now, as in 2012, he's running against the preferred candidates of the New York State and Suffolk County GOP.\n\nFor financial support, Demos has turned to Greek-Americans, mainly in California and New York, records show.\n\nFunders in his first two races included billionaire supermarket and oil magnate John Catsimatidis, San Diego Chargers owner Alex Spanos -- and Angelo K. Tsakopoulos, whose business controls 47,000 acres around Sacramento.\n\nTsakopoulos and relatives gave Demos $9,600 in 2010 -- before he had met his future wife -- and $28,500 in 2012. For this election, as of Jan. 1, the Tsakopoulos family and employees have given $45,500 of his $201,000 in contributions.\n\n\"George's family knows him and believes in him and how he'll stand for what's right,\" Tschirhart said.\n\nTsakopoulos, 78, who declined an interview, hasn't said why he, a friend and supporter of Democrats, started funding Demos, a GOP conservative.\n\nTsakopoulos backs President Barack Obama, who named his daughter Eleni Tsakopoulos Kounalakis ambassador to Hungary, and was a business partner with Pelosi's husband.\n\nIn contrast, Demos has attacked Zeldin and Bishop for helping implement Obamacare in most of the four television ads he's run since December.\n\nadvertisement | advertise on newsday\n\nWhat Tsakopoulos is doing isn't unusual in the Greek-American community, where ethnicity often trumps ideology and foreign policy on Greece often trumps domestic issues, said Nick Larigakis of the American Hellenic Institute, a public policy group.\n\n\"It's no secret he's a major Democratic supporter. But he has certainly supported Greek-American candidates on both sides of the aisle,\" he said.\n\nSince their marriage, which has produced a baby boy named Angelo, Chrysa, 28, has undergone a transformation from a California funder of Democrats -- donating $260,000 over a decade -- to a Republican registered to vote in Ronkonkoma.\n\nDemos is now a largely self-funded candidate with what an aide said is his own money. Yet in his personal financial disclosure filings, Demos said he has no salary and investments of less than $65,000.\n\nThe filings also show that his wife works for her father's firm, has her own bank account worth $100,000 to $250,000, and investments valued between $5 million and $25 million.\n\nadvertisement | advertise on newsday\n\nDemos can't touch his wife's investments for his race, election lawyer Jan Baran said.\n\nBut he can use half of the money they share: two bank accounts that after the wedding grew from less than $300,000 to $2 million to $10 million.\n\nThat indicates he can use up to $5 million for his campaign. So far he's loaned it $2 million.\n\nIf Demos doesn't pay himself back most of the loans by the election, Baran said, \"he'll just have to eat the money.\"\n\nTschirhart said he doesn't know how much money is in the joint accounts and hinted Demos is not concerned about repaying himself his loans.\n\n\"George and his wife,\" he said, \"have committed the resources necessary to win this election.\"", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.date": "Sat, 08 Mar 2014 21:32:00 -0500", "sailthru.author": "TOM BRUNE", "description": "Two years ago, Ronkonkoma lawyer George Demos surprised party officials when he abruptly quit the Republican congressional primary race on Long Island's East End for", "application-name": "Newsday", "pinterest": "http://cdn.newsday.com/polopoly_fs/1.7330429.1394331796!/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/display_600/image.JPG", "og": {"site_name": "Newsday", "description": "Two years ago, Ronkonkoma lawyer George Demos surprised party officials when he abruptly quit the Republican congressional primary race on Long Island's East End for", "title": "Demos' bid boosted by wife's family fortune", "url": "http://www.newsday.com/long-island/suffolk/demos-house-bid-boosted-by-wife-s-family-fortune-1.7329673", "image": "http://cdn.newsday.com/polopoly_fs/1.7330429.1394331796!/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/display_600/image.JPG", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Two years ago, Ronkonkoma lawyer George Demos surprised party officials when he abruptly quit the Republican congressional primary race on Long Island's East End for", "title": "Demos' bid boosted by wife's family fortune", "app": {"id": {"ipad": 358571317, "iphone": 358571317, "googleplay": "com.pagesuite.newsday"}}, "site": "@Newsday", "image": "http://cdn.newsday.com/polopoly_fs/1.7330429.1394331796!/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/display_600/image.JPG", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#1B3664", "msvalidate.01": "AC41EB10D1EC6B5358F0ECA0E861CCAA", "sailthru.title": "Demos' bid boosted by wife's family fortune", "p": {"domain_verify": "b22f651177478af415d53d6eb00b8167"}, "fb": {"pages": 19175874448, "app_id": 147686468041}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/img/newsday/nd-win8-icon.png", "keywords": "local politics nation politics suffolk ronkonkoma article newsday live", "google-site-verification": "o-9vlp-b_yaYN8wXq9FvnnetTEfKCHqJghR7f_DOTf4", "sailthru.tags": "local politics nation politics suffolk ronkonkoma article newsday live", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2030\"", "article_summary": "For this election, as of Jan. 1, the Tsakopoulos family and employees have given $45,500 of his $201,000 in contributions.\nadvertisement | advertise on newsday\"George Demos is running for Congress, not his family,\" said his campaign spokesman, Kevin Tschirhart.\nIf Demos doesn't pay himself back most of the loans by the election, Baran said, \"he'll just have to eat the money.\"\nTsakopoulos and relatives gave Demos $9,600 in 2010 -- before he had met his future wife -- and $28,500 in 2012.\nYet Demos' new fortune has strings attached by campaign finance law."}
