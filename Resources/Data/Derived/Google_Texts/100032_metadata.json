Col. Melvin Russell said police pursued a man who was spotted on surveillance cameras and appeared to be armed with a handgun. Police said the man was taken into custody after a brief chase, during which the sound of a gunshot was heard.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nRussell said that police never fired their weapons and that no one was shot. Russell said police recovered a handgun loaded with three rounds, one of which was spent. The suspect was not injured and did not want to be transported to a hospital but was taken to the hospital anyway in an ambulance, he said.\n\nLive television coverage and photos tweeted from the scene showed medics putting a man in an ambulance and a large police presence, with officers lining up to apparently block one street.\n\nThe activity is taking place in the same area where police first spotted Freddie Gray on April 12. He was arrested and fatally injured in police custody. Six officers were charged Friday in Gray\u2019s death.\n\nA few dozen police officers wearing helmets and carrying shields formed a line across North Avenue as crowds gathered across the street, occasionally shouting \u201ccontrol the police\u201d at the officers. Minutes after police briefed reporters, the line of officers left the street and police began to allow traffic to get through the intersection.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Baltimore Police Arrest Man on Gun Charge Near Scene of Riots", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Baltimore Police Arrest Man on Gun Charge Near Scene of Riots", "title": "Baltimore Police Arrest Man on Gun Charge Near Scene of Riots - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 2109, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/04/ap_ap-photo1440.jpg", "height": 1473}, "updated_time": "2015-05-04T13:22:23-07:00", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/05/04/baltimore-police-arrest-man-on-gun-charge-near-scene-of-riots/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Baltimore Police Arrest Man on Gun Charge Near Scene of Riots", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/04/ap_ap-photo1440.jpg", "title": "Baltimore Police Arrest Man on Gun Charge Near Scene of Riots - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "app_id": 1243316582352556, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Baltimore Police, Baltimore Riots, Freddie Gray, Penn North,Big Government,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "published_time": "2015-05-04T12:55:46-07:00", "section": "Big Government", "modified_time": "2015-05-04T13:22:23-07:00", "tag": "Penn North", "categories": "Big Government"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe00cc\"", "article_summary": "Police said the man was taken into custody after a brief chase, during which the sound of a gunshot was heard.\nLt.
