The heads, of course, belong to key administrators and Cabinet officials who are perceived to have contributed to whatever woes are besetting the president.\n\nThe calls come from both friends and foes of the White House. The friends want to satisfy and silence baying opponents with a pound of prominent flesh; the foes hope it\u2019s just the first pound.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nPresident Obama has been resistant to dismissing any senior person. He refused to fire Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius during the disastrous Obamacare rollout (though Sebelius later resigned). Nor has he, as of this writing, dismissed Secretary of Veterans Affairs Eric Shinseki, despite widespread problems in the VA that are ballooning into a damaging scandal.\n\nIf Obama gave Shinseki his walking papers, it would be out of character for this president. Except for Gen. Stanley McChrystal, it is hard to think of any significant appointee shown the door during Obama\u2019s first five years in office. (McChrystal was fired in June 2010 after his unflattering comments about the president surfaced in a Rolling Stone article.) Plenty of White House aides have cycled in and out, some perhaps nudged out the door, but \u201cno-drama Obama\u201d clearly does not like to make headlines with splashy sackings.\n\nIs this a good or bad practice? Is a president better off \u201cdemonstrating tough leadership\u201d and \u201cholding people accountable\u201d by dismissals, or should he stand behind his appointees?\n\nNaturally, it depends on the situation\u2014and more than public opinion is involved. Maybe the chief executive has had an irreparable breach with an adviser or there is an unresolvable policy dispute. Better to send a Cabinet member packing than let a sore fester.\n\nThe purely political questions are different, of course. What effect do firings have on public opinion? Does it help a president\u2019s job approval when he shakes up his team? Is there a pattern in history that can be detected, at least since polling began?\n\nTurns out, there are several trends worth noting. I examined the most prominent firings from Harry Truman to Barack Obama and tried to see what, if any, effect showed up in subsequent Gallup surveys. What I found was that delivering a prominent pink slip usually had only a minor impact on a president\u2019s popularity, even short-term. Moreover, the polling result for the president was more likely to be negative than positive.\n\nTake a look below at 35 cases of significant changes in presidential administrations where press reports made clear the departures were not voluntary. Even to political junkies, some of these events will be obscure, but at the time, the firings made front-page headlines and seemed very important. The inclusion of some dismissals involved judgment calls as to whether or not they were truly \u201cfirings.\u201d (Have we forgotten any?

Douglas MacArthur for insubordination during the Korean War in 1951, President Nixon\u2019s Watergate-related dismissals of aides Bob Haldeman, John Ehrlichman and John Dean in the spring of 1973 and his follow-up beheading of Watergate special prosecutor Archibald Cox in the autumn. Truman\u2019s decision, while judged correct by historians and military analysts, cost him whatever thin chance he had at reelection in 1952. Nixon\u2019s surgical strikes were designed to save his presidency but, along with the White House tapes, helped make him the first president to resign.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO Magazine", "description": "Would giving Shinseki the axe be good for Obama's poll numbers?", "title": "The Politics of White House Firings", "url": "http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2014/05/why-obama-isnt-going-to-fire-shinseki-107060.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2014/05/23/140523_sabato_shinseki_ap.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Barack Obama,Veterans,Politics,Eric Shinseki", "twitter": {"site": "@politicomag", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politicomag"}, "description": "Would giving Shinseki the axe be good for Obama's poll numbers?", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf6cd\"", "article_summary": "of defense Dec. 4-6 52% Dec. 17-19 54% Dec. 9, 1994 Joycelyn Elders Surgeon general Dec. 2-5 42% Dec. 16-18 42% Dec. 21, 1994 Mike Espy Sec.\nof agriculture Dec. 16-18 42% Dec. 28-30 40% G.W.\nNixon\u2019s surgical strikes were designed to save his presidency but, along with the White House tapes, helped make him the first president to resign.\nof defense Nov. 16-21 42% Dec. 7-12 46% Nixon Nov. 25, 1970 Wally Hickel Sec.\nPlenty of White House aides have cycled in and out, some perhaps nudged out the door, but \u201cno-drama Obama\u201d clearly does not like to make headlines with splashy sackings."}
