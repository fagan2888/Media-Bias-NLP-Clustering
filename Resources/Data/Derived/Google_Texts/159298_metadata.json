PETERSBURG \u2014 Pinellas County School Board members hope changing the name of Pinellas Technical Education Centers to Pinellas Technical College with boost the school\u2019s enrollment and reputation.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re always going to attract older students, but we\u2019re not being successful with the kids that graduate from high school and don\u2019t know what to do and don\u2019t choose PTEC for a number of reasons,\u201d Dave Barnes, executive director of Career Technical and Adult Education told school board members during a meeting last week. \u201cOver the 35 years in my career convinced me there is still a stigma attached to technical schools, but in other states where those schools were renamed technical colleges they\u2019ve seen an increase in enrollment with younger students. This is something we\u2019re passionate about, and I will find a reason to do this.\u201d\n\nLess than half of high school graduates in Pinellas know where they\u2019re going after school. Only about .2 percent of high school graduates in Pinellas County enroll at a technical center, despite the school district\u2019s web of high-school-level career programs, Barnes said.\n\nEnrollment at the Clearwater and St. Petersburg PTEC campuses has been stagnant for the past five years at about 12,000 students. Hillsborough Technical Education Centers enrolled more than 20,000 students last year.\n\nThe corporate community is \u201ccompletely behind\u201d the name change and the school district office of adult education has had a \u201cwar chest\u201d set aside for years to pay for the rebranding campaign when the time was right, Barnes said.\n\n\u201cWe are not what we were 20 years ago, we have morphed and our purpose has changed,\u201d Barnes said.\n\nThere have been a number of legislative movements in recent years to allow technical centers to call themselves colleges, Barnes said. During the past legislative session, a majority of the 48 technical centers in Florida petitioned to form a technical college system that would mirror the state university and college systems.\n\nThe bill also would have allowed vocational schools to offer Associates\u2019 degrees and apply for grants reserved for colleges. The measure stalled in the state Senate due to reluctance to create another school system, despite support in the House, Barnes said.\n\nThe school board in Broward County found a loophole. Though legislators didn\u2019t create a new law saying the technical centers can become colleges, there is no law that says they can\u2019t, Barnes said. After a quick vote from the school board, the former Atlantic, McFatter and Sheridan technical centers are now Atlantic Technical College, McFatter Technical College and Sheridan Technical College.\n\nWhile no legal challenges have been made against Broward County\u2019s name changes, there is a \u201cslight risk\u201d involved in the venture, said Pinellas school district attorney David Koperski. There are statutes that stipulate how an independently-funded institution can use the word college, but they don\u2019t include publicly funded schools.\n\n\u201cI would be happy to make that argument with a very straight face that that section doesn\u2019t apply to public school districts,\u201d Koperski said. \u201cWe have home rule authority that public school boards can exercise any power except those prohibited by law, and this is not expressly prohibited \u2026 There is an argument out there, but we have a good argument on our side as well.\u201d\n\nWhile Broward\u2019s move has spurred discussion, no other school districts have looked to follow suit, he said.\n\nSchool Board members have another concern. Pinellas County schools have a \u201cfriendship\u201d with St. Petersburg College \u201cunlike any other in the state,\u201d said Superintendent Michael Grego. The technical centers wouldn\u2019t be competing with SPC, and the school district would continue to offer joint programs with the college for high schoolers taking university-level courses, students enrolled in career academies specifically aligned to SPC courses and college students at SPC training to become Pinellas County teachers.\n\n\u201cI would support it but want to keep good relationship with SPC throughout this,\u201d said School Board member Peggy O\u2019Shea.\n\nGrego said he has discussed rebranding the technical centers as colleges with SPC\u2019s president William Law, who has pledged support for the school board\u2019s decision. Law spoke with SPC\u2019s Board of Trustees in the spring when the bill first appeared and the group decided naming PTEC a college would \u201cbuild on the economic issues of the community,\u201d Grego said.\n\nPTEC has struggled with getting students to enroll out of high school, even though many of its offered programs are aligned to courses taught at SPC. Rebranding the school as a college and erasing the stigma attached to a \u201ccenter\u201d could get more students to enroll in PTEC right after 12th grade, and then ultimately end up at SPC, Grego said.\n\nThere are already 35 programs at PTEC that are directly linked to classes at SPC where students can continue their education, Barnes said. Students can also start PTEC classes in high school that earn them college credits.\n\nThe school board is scheduled to meet with SPC officials in September; a good opportunity to continue the discussion, said School Board Chairwoman Carol Cook.\n\nWe want students to get good educations and good jobs, and some of the for-profits charge huge amounts of money. The kids don\u2019t finish and they leave with huge debt and no jobs,\u201d said School Board member Linda Lerner. \u201cI would celebrate this with fireworks.\u201d\n\nadawson@tampatrib.com\n\n(727) 215-9851\n\nTwitter: @adawsonTBO", "article_metadata": {"taboola-pub-time": "Sun, 27 Jul 2014 17:59:57 -0400", "Description": "ST.
