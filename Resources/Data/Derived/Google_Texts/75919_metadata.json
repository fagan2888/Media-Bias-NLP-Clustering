(AP)\n\nA mindboggling amount of personal information has been exposed as a result of the recent hacks against the Office of Personnel Management. The attacks now affect far more people than we originally thought: 22.1 million Americans, to be exact, or nearly 1 in 15 Americans.\n\nWhile some retail and health insurance hacks have affected more people, the OPM attacks represent the most significant to hit the government to date.\n\nTo put the hack in perspective, here\u2019s how it stacks up against the rest of the country.\n\nIf all the people caught up in the OPM hack lived together, they would amount to the nation\u2019s third-largest state after California and Texas.\n\n\n\nThey would displace Florida as the nation's third most populous state.

If that\u2019s the case, then the people swept up in the OPM hacks may actually have less to worry about than if the attacks were perpetrated by a criminal gang; China is unlikely to use the information for garden-variety financial fraud.\n\nBut the larger breach, affecting 21.5 million people, was of a security-clearance database that includes information that could be used by a foreign government to put unwanted pressure on U.S. officials.\n\nCorrection: A sharp-eyed reader points out that there are 22 billion trees in Maine, not 22 million.
