If recent Overdrive polling is correct, about a third of all owner-operators will pay extra this tax season \u2013 in many cases hundreds of dollars \u2013 for not carrying insurance through 2014.\n\nOpposition to the government mandate for insurance has remained strong and consistent among about a third of Overdrive readers since the ACA was \u201cforce-fed to the American public,\u201d as insurance broker Marc Ballard puts it. Furthermore, eight in 10 readers in early 2014, whether they had health insurance or not, noted they viewed the ACA negatively.\n\nThe open enrollment period for 2015 ended Feb. 15, then days later an exception was announced. Those who attest they\u2019ve heard about the penalty for the first time this tax season will be able to enroll when the exchanges reopen for them March 15-April 30. Those who were not covered for part of 2015 will pay at least a partial penalty in 2016.\n\nUnlike this year\u2019s three-month enrollment period and the six-month period the year before, the 2016 enrollment term lasts only eight weeks and runs earlier in the calendar, Oct. 15 to Dec. 7.\n\nPenalties for 2014 weren\u2019t exactly stiff \u2013 $95 per adult, half that for every child (with a maximum $285 for a family), or 1 percent of total family income, whichever is greater. There\u2019s the rub, says Todd Amen, president of owner-operator business-services firm ATBS.\n\n\u201cAs a general rule, our clients are more reactionary to all the rules and regs of the ACA than proactive,\u201d Amen says. Many weigh the difference between the costs of health-insurance coverage and the cost of not complying, determining that so far it makes sense not to comply.\n\nTips for shopping Obamacare coverage\n\nIn a podcast aired in January, Marc Ballard of the Truckers Insurance Exchange discussed Affordable Care Act-related issues. He offered tips for shopping on the health-insurance exchanges and what to consider if you\u2019re facing the decision on whether to opt for health coverage or pay the penalty when this coming year\u2019s open enrollment period comes around.**Premium discounts/subsidies are based on what the IRS calls Modified Adjusted Gross Income, not simply gross income. Based on income data from trucking-accounting firms, Ballard estimates about half of truckers probably qualify for a subsidy but that many don\u2019t know it.\n\n**For those who auto-renewed policies on the exchanges this year, shopping for a better deal might be advisable because of rising competition among insurers.\n\n**Take care in estimating your income. Underestimation could cause operators purchasing on the exchanges to later owe back part of any subsidy they garnered.\n\n**So-called \u201climited medical\u201d plans that specify a defined benefit for a particular medical service by and large aren\u2019t ACA-compliant. Though a lot of owner-operators remain covered by such plans, such operators also will be responsible for penalties assessed for not having compliant coverage under ACA. Follow this link to hear the podcast.\n\nThe average ATBS owner-operator client earned about $56,000 in 2014, with deductions bringing adjusted income down to \u201cthe low $40,000s,\u201d Amen says. For most, penalties will be calculated at 1 percent of modified adjusted gross income \u201crather than the minimum penalty.\u201d\n\nGranted, that $400-plus is a lot less than what those operators would have paid for health insurance over the course of last year. For healthy individuals without families, barring some expensive medical bills, the gamble of not getting covered in 2014 likely paid off.\n\nHowever, the fine for 2015 coverage will double to 2 percent of income, due at tax time in 2016. Penalties increase in 2016 to 2.5 percent of income, or $695 \u2013 again, whichever is greater \u2013 then change indexed to inflation.\n\nAs more operators consult with their accountants during this tax season, many of those without insurance are finding that it might make more sense to obtain the insurance and gain its benefits than to pay the higher penalty next year, says Bill Zenk, principal and senior transportation specialist at TrueNorth Companies.\n\nAt a certain point, \u201cgiving the government an extra $1,000 or more annually just doesn\u2019t make sense,\u201d Zenk says. \u201cWe\u2019re getting close to that breaking point.\u201d\n\nThe individual mandate for insurance, if it survives court challenges and leadership changes at the highest levels of government, could partially cripple the owner-operator business model, Zenk says. The added cost of insurance will have to be offset if the independent contractor model, including one-truck true independents with their own authority, is to survive.\n\n\u201cEmployers are having to make new decisions about what to offer to their employee base\u201d in terms of health coverage, too, he says. \u201cI think it\u2019s very new \u2013 this is the first year the ripples are starting to be felt. In the next couple of years, we\u2019ll see even more of a ripple effect.\u201d\n\nUncertainty surrounding the law continues. Today, the Supreme Court is scheduled to hear arguments in King v. Burwell. The challenge rests on an ACA language technicality but nonetheless holds the potential to eliminate subsidies for insureds who purchased insurance in one of the 36 federal-exchange states.\n\nIf the ACA remains as is, there will be, in Zenk\u2019s view, an \u201cindustry recognition that higher pay needs to be contemplated\u201d as an offset. \u201cOr you could see contractors exiting the industry or reverting back to company status.\u201d\n\nOverdrive last looked in-depth at the issue of health-insurance costs and coverage when the health-insurance exchanges rolled out in 2013, accompanied by enrollment problems that took months to fix. At that time, North Carolina-based owner-operator Bryan Spoon and his independent dispatcher partner, Anna Lowdermilk of Lowdermilk Carrier Services, were among those testing the waters of the exchanges.\n\nSpoon was accustomed to paying cash to a medical practitioner \u2013 at a discount \u2013 that he used for regular visits. Spoon, Lowdermilk and her son ultimately enrolled in bronze-level insurance plans from Blue Cross Blue Shield via the exchanges. They shopped mostly on price because a subsidy to reduce premiums relative to their income was not available.\n\nSpoon ended up paying $245 monthly, Lowdermilk and her son $256, for the \u201cBlue Advantage\u201d plan with a $5,000 annual deductible and a broad network of doctors to suit the potential for needed coverage far from home for the flatbedder. When open enrollment came around this year, the pair found that the plan\u2019s deductible had risen to $5,500 and the premium, for Spoon, to almost $290.\n\nThat premium is well less than comparable coverage Spoon priced prior to rollout of the Obamacare exchanges \u2013 according to Lowdermilk, as much as $900 a month.\n\nSome watchers contend that inflation of health care costs, including insurance, is slowing down since the ACA rollout, if not stopping altogether. A look at the Bureau of Labor Statistics\u2019 Medical Consumer Price Index reveals the slowdown, with inflation among the goods the Medical CPI measures (including health-insurance premiums) falling to about 2 percent annually following many pre-2009 years well above 4 percent.\n\nDuring the latest open-enrollment period, Zenk saw rates \u201cgoing up a little bit \u2013 not nearly at the rate you\u2019d seen in the 1990s and early 2000s.\u201d Zenk\u2019s company specializes in health and other insurance products for owner-operators. He\u2019s also part-owner and -operator of a 30-truck all-owner-operator fleet, Iowa-based Swingline Transport.\n\nTrueNorth\u2019s TrueChoices Marketplace opened with the rollout of the health-insurance exchanges in 2013 as a private exchange geared toward owner-operators. Zenk says call volume to TrueChoices exploded as Feb. 15 approached. Since the ACA has gone into effect, \u201cwe\u2019ve tripled our enrollment on the major medical component,\u201d Zenk says, referring to the ACA-compliant coverage they offer.\n\nKari Russell of the Owner-Operator Independent Drivers Association\u2019s own private exchange said in late January that inquiries had been heavy. Though enrollments also were picking up, with just a few weeks to go during the enrollment period, she said actual enrollments in compliant insurance plans via the exchange at that time were only at about half of the total number of OOIDA members enrolled during the first 2013-14 open enrollment period.\n\nUnited Healthcare, one of the big insurance carriers that declined to participate in the 2013-14 enrollment, entered the market this time, says Marc Ballard, a Florida-based independent insurance broker. \u201cBringing more carriers in \u2013 that competition helps sometimes to bring costs down,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019ll see in the long run how that impacts rates next year.\u201d\n\nZenk also believes that a \u201cbroad range of product offerings\u201d has helped mitigate price increases.\n\nAs the initially disastrous 2013-14 enrollment got underway, Ballard pursued a partnership to build a private exchange to connect with the federal and state exchanges in collaboration with the Healthy Trucking Association of America. Ultimately, as problems mounted for the federal and state exchanges, HTAA and Ballard parted ways, and the exchange never materialized.\n\nBallard fared better this time. Prior to the open enrollment period this winter, he and the National Association of Independent Truckers worked with Chicago-based ConnectedHealth, which provides an online platform through which users can shop for insurance. Together they opened the new Truckers Insurance Exchange (find Ballard via @TIETruckers on Twitter).\n\nIt\u2019s a private exchange geared toward drivers and owner-operators with agents who are able to offer assistance through the entire process, from a determination of subsidy/premium discount level to selecting a plan and enrolling.\n\nThe existence of the subsidies, says Zenk, also can account in part for what little slowdown in premium increases has been seen. Subsidies have helped tamp down insurance companies\u2019 risk of covering a pool of only those who need insurance the most.\n\n\u201cWe cannot offer a subsidy,\u201d notes Russell, though the OOIDA exchange\u2019s advisers are able to help association members determine if they may qualify. If so, members then connect to the federal or state exchange to purchase with a subsidy. If not, the OOIDA exchange is a good option. Though estimates have varied to as high as 50 percent for the number of owner-operators who may qualify for premium discounts on the exchanges, Russell says that \u201cvery few of the members qualify. We\u2019ve had a very, very small percentage to get the subsidies. They\u2019re owner-operators \u2013 they make a pretty good living.\u201d\n\nRussell points to other factors that are putting upward pressure on insurance rates, such as the closure of state-run high-risk pools that traditionally had covered those with pre-existing conditions. Those programs are no longer a necessity, given that ACA outlaws health insurance companies using such conditions as a reason to deny coverage. \u201cThat\u2019s scary for insurance companies,\u201d Russell says. \u201cThat causes a bigger drive for those uninsured to seek more health care.\u201d\n\nAlso, OOIDA got a notification from its primary insurance carrier that it no longer would offer commissions to agents for writing insurance in certain states.\n\nIf such trends continue, options for help geared specifically to owner-operators, such as these private marketplaces, could dwindle.\n\nFor those leaning toward getting coverage for the first time, a limited choice of what could be increasingly expensive insurance products versus the non-coverage penalty increases set for 2015 and 2016 could put many owner-operators between a rock and a hard place.", "article_metadata": {"description": "As health insurance tax penalties hit many owner-operators, the prospect of paying double next year could change the decision on coverage; meanwhile, the King v.
