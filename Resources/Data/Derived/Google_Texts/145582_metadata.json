Nathan Deal. From the press release:\n\nThe two leading and historic civil rights groups are involved in a joint effort to see the Confederate celebrations and symbols removed from Stone Mountain. They are also calling for the termination of all public monies used to sponsor hateful reminders of a cruel and bloody time in United States history. \u201cWhy are governments spending tax dollars to preserve monuments of hate?\u201d asked [SCLC president Charles] Steele. \u201cAnd more so, why put any reference of Dr. King, one of Georgia\u2019s most favorite sons, anywhere near these three traitors?\u201d\n\nOn Monday, state Sen. Vincent Fort, D-Atlanta, said much the same thing in an interview with NPR:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s as if the evil that those slave-owning Confederates perpetrated is somehow ameliorated by the presence of a monument for Dr. King.\u201d\n\nOn Monday, the Georgia chapter of the Sons of Confederate Veterans put out a statement that included this:\n\n\u201cThe erection of monuments to anyone other than Confederate heroes in Stone Mountain Park is in contradistinction to the purpose for which the park exists and would make it a memorial to something different. The park was never intended to be a memorial to multiple causes but solely to the Confederacy. \u201cTherefore, monuments to either \u2026 King or soldiers of any color who fought against the Confederacy would be a violation of the purpose for which the park was created and exists.\u201d\n\nIt is not a universal opinion. Governor Deal has endorsed the concept of an MLK monument atop Stone Mountain. The Rev. Joseph Lowery, who once headed up the SCLC, referred to the state plan as \u201camazing.\u201d\n\nJen Talaber, spokeswoman for the governor, confirmed the Wednesday meeting with the civil rights groups. After hearing his guests out, she said, Deal will also want to speak with them about his \u201cOpportunity School District\u201d plan \u2013 a 2016 constitutional referendum that would give the state the authority to take over failing public schools within local systems.\n\n***\n\nOn a related note, the OK Cafe is back. And so is the carved wood rendering of the old state flag that featured the Confederate battle emblem.\n\nThe revered Atlanta eatery was destroyed by a blaze in December, and some Democrats hoped the wood carving of Georgia\u2019s 1956 flag that hung on the restaurant\u2019s wall burned up with it.\n\nState Sen. Vincent Fort, the chamber\u2019s No. 2 Democrat, urged the restaurant\u2019s owner to take the carving down, and tried to rally business leaders to echo his call. Susan DeRose, the restaurant\u2019s owner, said the flag is party of her history \u201cand my history has absolutely nothing to do with prejudice against anyone.\u201d\n\nThe restaurant quietly reopened its doors on Monday and Tony Wilbert, a former AJC reporter-turned-public relations mogul, was among a few patrons who trickled in. \u201cThings are finally getting back to normal in Buckhead,\u201d he noted in a blog post that included the above picture.\n\nFort, meanwhile, said he was surprised to hear the flag remained.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to continue with our efforts to educate the public and the owners of OK Caf\u00e9,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m contacting major businesses in the Atlanta area who have agreed not to patronize any of the restaurants owned by OK Caf\u00e9\u2019s ownership group.\u201d\n\n***\n\nThe Cobb County Commission, which once raised a ruckus by decrying the \u201cgay lifestyle,\u201d today will consider whether to offer full pension benefits to the same-sex spouses of county employees. From the Marietta Daily Journal:\n\nThe proposed amendment would remove references to the \u201clawful wife of a male Participant\u201d and \u201clawful husband of the female Participant\u201d in favor of \u201cthe person who is treated as married\u201d to the employee. Captain Cathy Brandt, a 26-year veteran of the Cobb Fire Department, welcomes the change, which will give her the option to include her wife, Kathleen Burton, associate pastor at Virginia Highland Church, in her retirement plan. \u201cI was planning on moving out of state for sure (when I retired), but now I don\u2019t have to do that,\u201d said Brandt, who married her wife in New York three years ago after 13 years together. \u201cIt was a load off me that this happened before I retire to give me choices.\u201d\n\n***\n\nThe Democrats seeking the presidency will meet in their first debate tonight. If you\u2019re not in Las Vegas like one of us, there are some local watch parties you can check out.\n\nThe Hillary Clinton campaign is hosting a get-together featuring House Minority Leader Stacey Abrams at The Glenwood, 1263 Glenwood Ave SE, Atlanta.\n\nBernie Sanders fans have organized dozens of area get-togethers (a map here on Sanders\u2019 website). The ones with the most sign-ups so far are at Fad\u00f3 Irish Pub, 273 Buckhead Ave., Atlanta; Joystick Gamebar, 427 Edgewood Ave. SE, Atlanta; and Marlow\u2019s Tavern, 1317 Dunwoody Village Pkwy #102, Dunwoody.\n\nThe Democratic Party of Georgia (in conjunction with the LGBTQ Caucus and the YDG Stonewall Caucus) is throwing a bash at Amsterdam Atlanta, 502-A Amsterdam Ave. NE, Atlanta.\n\n***\n\nOn the Republican side, Jeb Bush is rolling out his replacement plan for Obamacare today in New Hampshire. The Washington Post has a preview:\n\nBush\u2019s plan would \u201cprovide a tax credit for the purchase of affordable, portable health plans that protect Americans from high-cost medical events,\u201d according to his campaign, and it would \u201cincrease contribution limits and uses for Health Savings Accounts to help with out of-pocket costs.\u201d The campaign did not provide more details about the credit or what the new contribution caps would be. The plan also calls for increasing funding to the National Institutes of Health; reviewing regulations seen as \u201cbarriers\u201d to innovation; capping \u201cthe employer tax exclusion to lower insurance premiums;\u201d and enabling \u201csmall businesses to make tax-free contributions to their workers\u2019 individual, portable health plans,\u201d the Bush campaign said.\n\nThe framework sounds somewhat similar to Roswell Republican Rep. Tom Price\u2019s long-standing plan, but we\u2019ll see how the details align.\n\n***\n\nThe race for Speaker of the House by Coweta County Rep. Lynn Westmoreland, Texas Rep. Bill Flores and others is basically frozen this week as Congress is out of session and everyone waits to see if Rep. Paul Ryan rides in on a white horse.\n\nOne impediment for Ryan: The same forces that forced out John Boehner and helped stymie Kevin McCarthy see the former vice presidential nominee as a squish. From the New York Times:\n\nHe is being criticized on issues ranging from a 2008 vote to bail out large banks to his longstanding interest in immigration reform to his work on a bipartisan budget measure. On Sunday night, the Drudge Report \u2014 a prime driver of conservative commentary \u2014 dedicated separate headlines to bashing Mr. Ryan on policy positions. Even a self-congratulatory book outlining how Mr. Ryan and two other Republican House leaders drafted Tea Party candidates to help them take over the House in 2010 \u2014 \u201cYoung Guns\u201d \u2014 is being recast by some as a manual of how to be traitorous to conservatism. \u201cTryouts for speaker continue,\u201d Phyllis Schlafly, founder and chairwoman of the conservative Eagle Forum, said in a statement Friday, when Mr. Ryan was escaping Capitol Hill for the week. \u201cThe kingmakers are so desperate for someone to carry their liberal priorities that they are trying to force Congressman Paul Ryan into a job he does not want.\u201d\n\n***\n\nGiven that parental flare-up in Walton County over middle-school kids who were being taught the basics of Christianity, Judaism and Islam, this might be worth paying attention to as something that might pop up here in January.
