But I haven\u2019t missed anything. Here, in a blatant lie published in the Washington Post, another traitor claims crimes never raised, let alone prosecuted. Why? Because facts no longer matter to the Traitorous \u201cParty of Lincoln.\u201d Just claim to be non-partisan and then lie (imbecility emphasized):\n\nEncouraged by the lack of a public backlash, an uninquisitive press, cover from the White House and an eager-to-please bureaucracy, the Democrats are boldly counting on the IRS to be their political and policy enforcer .This statement isn\u2019t an overreach by the \u201cvast right-wing conspiracy\u201d or a phony crisis created by hecklers (like me) on the right \u2014 it goes back to the early stages of President Obama\u2019s reelection campaign.\n\nSeriously? Listen to the self-admitted \u201cparanoid\u201d partisan (in \u201cPost Partisan\u201d?!?? I guess the WaPo has forgotten that words have actual meanings.)\n\nRemember the case of Romney supporter Frank Vandersloot ? Before the 2012 campaign, he was publicly accused of having a \u201cless-than-reputable record\u201d by Team Obama and then found himself the target of IRS and Department of Labor audits.\n\nThere is zero proof of this. In fact, this \u2018fact\u2019 comes from a Wall Street Journal OPINION piece that carefully lays out the assertion and doesn\u2019t claim it\u2019s true:\n\nDid Mr. Obama pick up the phone and order the screws put to Mr. VanderSloot? Or\u2014more likely\u2014did a pro-Obama appointee or political hire or career staffer see that the boss had an issue with this donor, and decide to do the president an unasked-for election favor? Or did he or she simply think this was a duty, given that the president had declared Mr. VanderSloot and fellow donors \u201cless than reputable\u201d?\n\nNotice the \u2018alternative\u2019 explanation is that it was more likely a corrupt IRS official who divined the secret Nixon agenda of Obama. How about this \u201cmore likely\u201d scenario: the Wall Street Journal\u2019s opinion pages have not given a whit about \u201ctruth\u201d at least since they accused the Clintons of murdering their close friend Vince Foster, who committed suicide following a GOP smear campaign designed to (effectively, as it turns out) \u201cdestroy\u201d him? Gee. Here\u2019s the following WSJ \u201cevidence\u201d paragraph:\n\nMr. VanderSloot says he \u201cexpected the public beatings\u201d from the left after the naming, but he \u201calso wondered whether government agencies, anxious to please their boss, would take notice of the target he had apparently placed on me. Now that I\u2019m being singled out for audits, I can\u2019t help but wonder whether there is a connection.\u201d\n\nLots of Republicans AND Democrats are audited every year \u2014 in contradistinction to the paranoia of the Party of Nixon.\n\nBut this is \u201csufficient\u201d for our liar to claim it as \u201cfact.\u201d The WaPo Wacko continues:\n\nThis was just one example of an individual who was persecuted because of his donation to a pro-Romney super PAC, but it served as a sufficient warning and no doubt had a chilling effect on others who were inclined to support the Republican nominee for president in 2012. And we now know that while this was going on, the IRS was actively suppressing conservative organizations seeking tax-exempt status because they opposed the president and the Democrats\u2019 policy positions\u2026.\n\nThe \u201cpost-partisan\u201d \u201cwriter\u201d must be on a \u201cski\u201d vacation in Colorado, if you catch my drift.\n\nIf facts don\u2019t matter, well, then: RNC national chairperson Reince Priebus.\n\nIt is merely a series of paranoid assertions, as the author concludes with:\n\nMaybe I\u2019m a paranoid Republican, but you don\u2019t have to be a conspiracist to see that there is an ominous pattern emerging of the IRS being involved on behalf of the president\u2019s political interests. Follow Ed on Twitter: @EdRogersDC\n\nSeriously?\n\nNo, you don\u2019t have to be SANE to see this \u201cominous\u201d pattern emerge. In fact, sanity operates as an outright inhibition to seeing such a self-serving fantasy.\n\n\u2018I\u2019d like to reserve my rubber room now, to avoid the rush \u2026\u2019\n\n\u201cPost Partisan\u201d? as the title for a BLATANTLY PARTISAN \u2018post-facts\u2019 post dredging up the most paranoid and vicious lies that the lunatic blogger could get away with under the aegis of \u201cspirited debate\u201d??\n\nAn article in The Hill quotes several vulnerable Senate Democrats \u2014 such as Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.) and Sen. Mark Pryor (D-Ark.) \u2014 who are openly demanding the IRS increase their intimidation of organizations that may oppose them. Obviously, the Democrats expect more from their team members at the IRS in the months leading up to the 2014 elections.\n\nAnd Pete Seeger was a commie. Right.\n\nYou mean that asking the IRS to enforce the law against \u201ccharitable\u201d organizations that the Kochs and others use as secret money laundering operations to inject stealth dollars into campaigns in complete disregard for law and democracy proves that the IRS is on the Democrats\u2019 \u201cteam\u201d?\n\nMore Republican \u201ctruth\u201d\n\nSounds like a \u201cmarijuana overdose\u201d to me*. Quick, call the paramedics!\n\nGee. I have been asking the IRS to enforce those self-same laws since 1996. And I showed their blatant abuse in 2006. But hey, whatever Judases your goat, mister \u201cpost partisan.\u201d\n\nOr, as usual with liars and forwarders to your grandma, the \u201cSnopes\u201d piece quoted doesn\u2019t say what the liar asserts that it says. Oh dear.\n\nAnother series of famous GOP lies\n\nWhat lame non-editor and the non-journalist WaPo allowed this libel to print? Or, like pornography, do words not matter anymore?\n\nIf you really BELIEVE this nonsense, then you ALSO believe that each and every IRS agent is a liberal Democrat, committed to a partisan takeover of the USA through endless political intimidation, without a single, solitary whistle-bl0wer for the Krauthammers and Aileses of the Reicht to debrief.\n\nAnd, obviously, you must also believe in Unicorns.\n\nShame on any professional news organization for printing this swill. Collaborators in the destruction of civil society, as history will undoubtedly show. Feh. Ptui.\n\nWe have passed the \u201cBleeding Kansas\u201d phase of American treason. With the nullification, the open obstruction and blatant disregard for uncomfortable facts that do not fit into the treasonous narrative, we are on the verge of \u201cBull Run.\u201d\n\nLet me stoop to their level:\n\nMaking up fake narratives to whip up their cannon fodder, the Republicans openly plot to take over the country by violence and intimidation.\n\nMy blatant assertion without any evidence presented whatsoever has the virtue of being at least partially true.\n\nCourage.\n\n* There is no such thing as a marijuana overdose \u2014 since THC is remarkably NON-toxic.\n\nI have been away for more than a month, and that is explained, HERE, because it is not in keeping with the language or mission of THIS blog.
