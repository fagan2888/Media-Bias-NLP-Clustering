Together those plans account for more than 95 percent of the entire insurance market in the state.

That\u2019s on average \u2014 some particular providers may have lost money, but overall group insurance and public insurance were profitable markets in 2015.\n\nThe seven council insurance plans combined for an operating loss of $158.5 million on $25 billion in premium revenue, which includes losses in the individual market and profits in other sectors. About half of the losses were offset by investment income.\n\nINDIVIDUAL MARKET \u2018VERY VOLATILE\u2019\n\nThe small size of the individual market might contribute to its volatility. With more people in a market, there\u2019s more healthy people to balance out high-cost individuals.\n\n\u201cThe individual market in Minnesota is still very volatile, still very unstable, which is, I think, a cause for concern,\u201d said Allan Baumgarten, a Twin Cities health industry analyst.\n\nJim Schowalter, the council\u2019s president, said health plans expected some volatility in the individual market but didn\u2019t expect it would take this long.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the sorting out that we would all hoped would take just a year or two, but obviously it\u2019s going to take a little longer,\u201d he said.\n\nMinnesota is unusual in having such a volatile, money-losing individual market. Baumgarten said some states have seen competitive, profitable individual markets emerge. But Minnesota isn\u2019t one of them.\n\nThe highest-profile part of the individual market is MNsure, the state-run health insurance exchange. In 2015, MNsure accounted for about one-sixth of Minnesota\u2019s individual market \u2014 among the lowest shares in the nation. The remaining five-sixths bought their insurance directly from health insurers.\n\nA MNsure spokesman declined comment Friday on the council\u2019s announcement.\n\nSchowalter said it was too early to say what specific factors drove expenses last year. He identified one likely culprit as prescription drug costs but said data to establish that won\u2019t be available until May.\n\nRESULTS DON\u2019T NECESSARILY PREDICT 2017 PREMIUMS\n\nThe fact that insurers had profitable years in the group and public insurance markets but lost money in the individual market doesn\u2019t necessarily say anything about what premiums will do in 2017.\n\nPartway through 2015, preliminary data about losses led most health insurers to propose big premium increases as high as 50 percent.\n\nBy law, insurers are allowed to raise rates only to account for expected future costs, not to recoup past losses.\n\nInsurers maintain reserve funds to cover down years, such as many providers experienced in the individual market in 2015.\n\nBaumgarten cautioned that insurers have good reason to downplay any profits and play up losses.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s this sense that Minnesotans have this expectation that not-for-profits should literally be making small profits. So that\u2019s how they\u2019re trying to present their results,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Health", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Twin Cities", "description": "Minnesota\u2019s major health plans lost money last year, and the red ink was driven by a small section of the market.
