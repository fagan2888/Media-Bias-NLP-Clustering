Hint: Sarah Palin has lost her mind.\n\nYou\u2019re going to read a lot of analysis of this weekend\u2019s Freedom Summit as the unofficial beginning of the Iowa caucus.\n\nWhether that\u2019s true depends entirely on how many of those who attended are still standing one long year from now\u2014and how many of those who didn\u2019t attend (Jeb Bush, Rand Paul) have campaigns that are still alive and well.\n\nThe event does serve as a gauge for a candidate\u2019s willingness to pander, and it is the beginning of serious media scrutiny for all the candidates as 2016 candidates, not as quaint spectacles (Donald Trump, Ted Cruz) or interesting anomalies (Ben Carson, Carly Fiorina)\u2026. or familiar former presidential candidates, who made up a non-shocking majority of the featured speakers (Rick Perry, Rick Santorum, Newt Gingrich, Sarah Palin).\n\nWhat did we learn?\n\nPalin is past her sell-by date.\n\nIt\u2019s the unofficial policy of many serious political reporters (myself included) to not cover Palin speeches. So it\u2019s entirely possible I missed a key stretch of her decline that would help make sense of, or have prepared me for, the word-salad-with-a-cup-of-moose-stew that she presented.\n\nSample passage: \u201cThings must change for our government! It isn\u2019t too big to fail, it\u2019s too big to succeed! It\u2019s too big to succeed, so we can afford no retreads or nothing will change, with the same people and same policies that got us into the status quo! Another Latin word, status quo, and it stands for, \u2018Man, the middle class and everyday Americans are really gettin\u2019 taken for a ride.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe speech (perhaps a generous description) went on 15 minutes past the 20 minutes allotted other speakers. And even as she ended it, one sensed less a crescendo than the specter of a gong, a hook to pull her off, or\u2014a sincere thought I had\u2014an ambulance to take her\u2026 somewhere.\n\nNo else embarrassed themselves out of the race.\n\nThe event was organized by immigration hawk Rep. Steve \u201cCantaloupes\u201d King (with the help of Citizens United) and many pundits fretted (or eagerly anticipated) 47-percent-style gaffes in the service of speakers trying to out-xenophobe each other. I may have missed something, but the anti-immigration rhetoric stayed on the \u201cself-deport\u201d side of offensive. Santorum did some under-the-breath dog whistling in reference to legal immigration, positing that the U.S. is home to more non-native citizens than ever before. He contrasted those non-native-born workers to, ahem, \u201cAmerican workers.\u201d As far as I know, if you work in America, you are an \u201cAmerican worker.\u201d Unless Santorum is thinking of something else.\n\nThe soft bigotry of low expectation works!\n\nScott Walker continues to clear the \u201cnot Tim Pawlenty\u201d bar, but no one seems to realize how weak of a standard that is. National journalists cooed over Walker\u2019s relatively energetic speech, apparently forgetting they were comparing it to other Walker speeches. In a similar vein, Chris Christie did not intentionally piss anyone off or bully the audience. Christie gave what seemed a lot like a national-audience speech\u2014probably the only speaker that played it so safe.\n\nSen. Mike Lee gave some sensible, serious suggestions.\n\nI may be engaging in more expectation management, but I was pleasantly surprised by Lee\u2019s earnest and non-applause-line-ridden speech. He beseeched the audience to look for a candidate that was \u201cpositive, principled, and proven\u201d\u2014all while explicitly taking himself out of the running. In what could have been a direct jab at his fellow guests, he quipped, \u201cThe principled candidate is not necessarily the guy who yells \u2018Freedom!\u2019 the loudest.\u201d He could have been quoting Elizabeth Warren when he softened typical GOP bootstrap rhetoric: \u201cFreedom doesn\u2019t mean \u2018You\u2019re all on your own,\u2019\u201d he said, \u201cIt means, \u2018We\u2019re all in it together.\u2019\u201d Elizabeth Warren would approve.\n\nThe GOP is going to need to figure out how to run against someone who is not Obama.", "article_metadata": {"twitter": {"site": "@thedailybeast", "card": "summary", "creator": "anamariecox"}, "keywords": "Republican Party, u.s. poli, Donald Trump, Iowa,United States, Sarah Palin", "publicationDate": 201501251145, "wrap": "/content/dailybeast/politics", "description": "GOP presidential contenders flocked to Iowa on Saturday to try out their pitches on the unofficial beginning of the Iowa Caucus.
