Two times within the first 15 minutes of his speech to an overflow crowd at Robarts arena, protesters were led out by security, causing a delay as Trump waited for the demonstrators to leave the arena.\n\nHowever, unlike the report that surfaced last week that a Black Lives Matter protester was assaulted by members of the crowd as he was led out of a Trump rally, the Donald did all he could do from the podium to ensure that wouldn\u2019t happen again.\n\n\u201cBe nice. Don\u2019t hurt the person,\u201d he said after the first protester was taken away. \u201cDon\u2019t be rude. Don\u2019t hurt them.\u201d\n\nAlthough Trump continues to amaze the political world with his front-running status in the Republican race for president, there was a poll released on Friday that shows that some of his recent comments may (finally) hurting his candidacy. The Reuters/Ipso survey showed Trump had lost 12 percentage points within the last week.\n\nThe latest controversy that he\u2019s attempted to tamp down regard allegations that surfaced right before the holiday break that he had physically mocked a New York Times reporter named Serge Kovaleski this past week. Kovaleski is disabled.\n\n\u201cNow I took a lot of heat from a newspaper, that\u2019s a failed newspaper,\u201d the New York City real estate magnate began in what would ultimately be a 15-minute extended monologue where he excoriated the Gray Lady.\u201d So all of a sudden I hear that because I expressed myself very strongly, all of a sudden I was mocking somebody,\u201d he said, adding \u201cI would never mock a person that has difficulties.\u2019\n\nTo back up his previous controversial claim of seeing \u201cthousands\u201d of spectators celebrate 9/11 in New Jersey, Trump cited a 2001 Washington Post story written by Kovaleski about authorities detaining people who had celebrated the attack on rooftops with views of the site. Kovaleski has said recently that he does not remember \u201cthousands or even hundreds\u201d of people were celebrating, but doesn\u2019t deny celebrations in some capacity didn\u2019t take place.\n\nTrump\u2019s defense of his remarks and his subsequent takedown of the paper (including a critique of what he said was their poor financial management) dominated the middle portion of his hourlong addressed before a crowd estimated to be around 5,000 people. It ended with Trump saying that he hoped to get an apology from the Times \u201cbefore they go out of business.\u201d\n\nTrump arrived and departed in style, flying in on his own helicopter. He gave a short, eight-minute speech to a crowd of at least 500 people who couldn\u2019t get into the arena when he touched down at around 12:20 p.m., though the first three minutes of that speech was solely about finding small kids who would want to go up in a short ride on the helicopter.\n\nIn his speech to the audience inside the arena, Trump laid close to a variation on what has become his basic stump speech (other than the assault on the Times).\n\nHe was particularly exercised by a recent report in the L.A. Times about super PACS. The story reported that a super PAC created to bring down the Affordable Care Act in 2014 used Ben Carson as a selling point, and ultimately raised over $6 million in 2014, but just 2 percent of that went to GOP candidates or committees. Trump is one of the few presidential candidates who doesn\u2019t have one and has pretty much self-funded his campaign, though he says that he has received more than 80,000 \u201csmall\u201d contributions from donors that he has kept. But he calls the super PACS \u201ca big scandal.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re totally controlling candidates,\u201d he charged. \u201cThey\u2019re like puppets. They\u2019re totally controlling the candidates, whether it\u2019s Bush or this totally phony Kasich.\u201d\n\nSpeaking of Bush, both he and Marco Rubio received plenty of attention from the GOP front-runner in their home state.\n\n\u201cI disagree with Bush, he\u2019s a nice person, he\u2019s trying to be tough right now, but you can\u2019t act, you have to be tough,\u201d Trump opined. \u201cYou know, he wants to get tough. And Rubio wants to get tough.\u201d\n\nTrump then mentioned how Rubio skipped a hearing on homeland security right after the Paris attacks to attend a fundraiser (Rubio campaign spokesman Alex Conant later said that Rubio was missing the briefings after attending a classified Intelligence Committee session on the attacks).\u201d\u201dI don\u2019t care. I don\u2019t dislike him,\u201d Trump said of Rubio. \u201cI\u2019m just saying it\u2019s not right, OK? Especially somebody young, who hasn\u2019t been there before. I mean \u2026 the seat isn\u2019t even warm and he\u2019s running for another office, and he \u2018s not going to win.\u201d\n\nOf Bush, Trump said that he rarely mentions him anymore on the stump, as the former Florida governor continues to stand way behind Trump and Ben Carson in the polls. \u201cBy the way, he\u2019s a low-energy person, right?\u201d he said, one of his original criticisms of Bush that seems to have stuck in the imagination of the GOP voting public.\n\nLately, Trump has been blasting Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton with a variation on that theme, saying she doesn\u2019t have the \u201cstrength of the stamina to be beat me,\u201d adding, \u201cWe need somebody with endurance, with unbelievable strength.\u201d\n\nClinton was only referenced one other time, when the former Apprentice host said flatly, \u201cShe should be in jail for what she did!\u201d receiving one of the loudest cheers of the afternoon.\n\nBefore the speech, several people in the audience remarked on how much they loved Trump\u2019s lack of political correctness.\n\nHe basically says it like it is,\u201d said Nicole Affatao from Lakewood Ranch. \u201cHe says what everybody is thinking. We have to cut the \u2018you know what\u2019 out, and just say it like it is. We\u2019re in bad shape. I don\u2019t want the future of this country to be bad for my kids.\u201d\n\nBradenton resident Arnie Vatow, 64 said he had no issues with any of Trump\u2019s recent controversial comments, and certainly not regarding Muslims.\n\n\u201cI think it will be entertaining,\u201d he said of a possible Trump presidency. \u201cHe\u2019s a deal maker and we need a deal maker on a lot of these treaties and future treaties, and Iran. And he has a knack of picking the best people. I have faith in him.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe talks like the common man, speaks about what we want to hear,\u201d said Brandon resident Rich Gross. When asked if hearing Trump say he\u2019ll \u201cbomb the sh*t our of ISIS,\u201d is too simplistic an answer to the problem of how to deal with the latest edition of Middle East terrorism, Gross disagreed.\n\nYes, go for it. End it. quickly and out of the way. Get it done with. It\u2019s not working the way were doing it right now? We gotta do something different.\u201d\n\nA crowd of about 50 protesters greeted patrons as they entered the Robarts Arena, blasting Trump for his stances in particular on immigration.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Florida Politics", "description": "Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump helicoptered into Sarasota on Saturday afternoon for his first campaign appearance since Thanksgiving, and protesters were ready for him.
