Roche, PhD, JD\n\nHealthcare providers sometimes can get caught up in a political storm. When this happens, audits can be used as a weapon to help preferred providers muscle into a market. This appears to have happened recently in New Mexico.\n\nLet\u2019s go back in time.\n\nOn Sept. 14, 2010, Susana Martinez was in Washington, D.C. She was looking for campaign contributions to run for the governorship of New Mexico. She visited the office of the government lobbying division of UnitedHealth Group and picked up a check for $25,000.\n\nThe next day, Martinez published an editorial claiming that Bill Richardson\u2019s administration in New Mexico was tolerating much \u201cwaste, fraud and abuse\u201d in its Medicaid program. Eventually, she was elected as the 31st governor of New Mexico and took office Jan. 1, 2011.\n\nAccording to an email trail, by the fall of 2012, Martinez\u2019s administration was busy exchanging emails with members of the boards of directors of several healthcare companies in Arizona. During this same period, the Arizonans made a number of contributions to a political action committee (PAC) set up to support Martinez. At the same time, officers from New Mexico\u2019s Human Services Department (HSD) made a number of unannounced visits to Arizona.\n\nThe lobbying continued in earnest. Hosted in part by UnitedHealth money, the head of HSD visited Utah\u2019s premier ski resort, and the bill was paid for by an organization financed in part by UnitedHealth. The governor\u2019s chief of staff was treated to dinner at an expensive steakhouse in Las Vegas. There is suspicion of other contacts, but these have not been identified. All of these meetings were confidential.\n\nThe governor continued to publicly criticize health services in New Mexico. She focused on 15 mental health providers who had been in business for 40 years. They were serving 87 percent of the mental health population in New Mexico and had developed an extensive delivery system that reached all corners of the state.\n\nMartinez honed in on one mental health provider because the CEO used a private aircraft. He was accused of using Medicaid funds to finance a lavish lifestyle. None of this was true. It turned out that the owner had operations all over the state and used the plane for commuting, but it made for good sound bites to feed the press.\n\nThe state decided to raise the pressure against the providers. Public Consulting Group (PCG), a Boston-based contractor, was called in to perform an audit of mental health services. In addition to taking samples and performing analyses of claims, PCG was asked to look for \u201ccredible allegations of fraud.\u201d\n\nIn legal terms, the phrase \u201ccredible allegations of fraud\u201d carries much weight. Under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, it can be used to justify punitive actions against a provider. It is surprising that only \u201callegations\u201d are necessary, not demonstrated proof. The reality is that in practical terms, a provider can be shut down based on allegations alone.\n\nIn a letter regarding its work, PCG stated that \u201cthere are no credible allegations of fraud.\u201d Evidently, that was the wrong answer. PCG was kicked out of New Mexico and not allowed to complete its audit. HSD took over.\n\nThe PCG letter had been supplied to HSD in a Microsoft Word format. In a stunning act, HSD removed the statement concluding that there were \u201cno credible allegations of fraud.\u201d HSD continued to use the PCG letter, but only in this altered form.\n\nHSD continued to insist publicly that there were credible allegations of fraud. Since PCG had been kicked out before completing the audit, a HSD staff attorney took the liberty of performing several statistical extrapolations that generated a repayment demand of more than $36 million. During testimony, the attorney admitted that the extent of his experience with statistics was an introductory course he had taken years earlier in college.\n\nTwo years later, statistical experts from Barraclough NY LLC who are elected fellows of the American Statistical Association examined HSD\u2019s work and concluded that it was faulty and unreliable. They concluded there was zero credibility in the extrapolations.\n\nBut for the time being, the extrapolations and audits were powerful tools. On June 24, 2013, all of the aforementioned 15 nonprofits were called into a meeting with HSD. All were accused of massive fraud. They were informed that their Medicaid payments were to be impounded. The money needed to service 87 percent of New Mexico\u2019s mental health population was being cut off.\n\nThe next day, UnitedHealth announced a $22 million investment in Santa Fe. We have not been able to track down the direct beneficiaries of these investments. However, we do know that the governor\u2019s office immediately issued a press release on their behalf.\n\nThe 15 New Mexico providers were being driven out of business. This had been planned well in advance. Shortly thereafter, the government of New Mexico, through HSD, [approved] issued $18 million in no-bid contracts to five Arizona-based providers affiliated with UnitedHealth. These are the same companies that had been contributing to the governor\u2019s PAC.\n\nThese five Arizona companies then took over all mental health services for New Mexico. Their first step was to begin cutting back services. To give one example: patients with two hours therapy per week were cut back to 10 fifteen-minute sessions per year.It was the beginning of a mental health crisis in New Mexico.\n\nAs of today, two of the Arizona providers have abandoned their work in New Mexico. A third is in the process of leaving. What is the result? Thousands of New Mexico mental health patients have been left with no services. Entire communities have been completely shut [cut] off. The most vulnerable communities have been hit the hardest.\n\nThrough litigation, the 15 original providers forced the New Mexico Attorney General to examine the situation. It took a long time. All of the providers now are out of business. The Attorney General reported a few weeks ago that there were never any credible allegations of fraud.\n\nThis should mean that the impounded money would be returned to the 15 providers. After all, the legal reason why it was impounded in the first place has been shown to be false. One would think that the situation could return to normal.\n\nThe original 15 should be able to continue their business, and hire back the more than 1,500 persons they had been forced to lay off. Once the impounded monies are returned to the providers, they will be able to pay their legal bills, which now add up to hundreds of thousands of dollars.\n\nUnfortunately, that is not happening. HSD still is claiming that the $36 million extrapolation is due, and that actually, the providers owe the state money. The New Mexico government is not budging from its position. The litigation continues.\n\nMeanwhile, New Mexico now is tied with Montana in having the highest suicide rate in the continental United States.\n\nAbout the Author\n\nEdward M.
