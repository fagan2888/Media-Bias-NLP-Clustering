But for some people, this well-intentioned act of good will can be a helpless curse. According to John Hopkins pediatrician Dr. Kate Puttgen, excessive sweating can be \u201cpsychosocially isolating\u201d and debilitating, particularly for children and adolescents. For adults, the inevitable over-production of sweat at work, parties, or the gym can often create its own problems. \u201cAdults have difficulty with social and professional interactions, everything from shaking hands at a business meeting to intimacy,\u201d Puttgen wrote in an email to Medical Daily. So what exactly causes some people to sweat more than others? How does a person become part of \u2014 or more importantly get out of \u2014 that exclusive club, the sweat set?\n\nTo understand excessive sweating, we should first understand why humans naturally sweat. Your body contains about two to five million sweat glands embedded into your skin and located all over your body. These glands secrete different amounts of sweat depending on your physiological characteristics. For example, it\u2019s well known that men\u2019s sweat glands tend to secrete more sweat than women\u2019s. But besides that, how much you sweat depends on some other things, too, like the temperature of the place you\u2019re in, how hard you\u2019re exercising (if you\u2019re working out), your level of anxiety, and your weight. Overweight people sweat more because the body perceives them to need more sweat to cool down. These are all natural differences in the human body. Our bodies, which are inherently different, react to temperature or exercise in different ways. The Columbia University Center for Hyperhydrosis emphasizes \u201cthe physiologic response of the autonomic nervous system to exercise or high temperature is normal.\u201d In other words, if you're sweating more than usual after strenuous walking, you probably have nothing to worry about.\n\nSo when does excessive sweating become a medical condition?\n\nSweat Overload: Hyperhidrosis\n\nThere are two types of \"excessive sweating\": one that\u2019s natural to variations in human physiology (as described above) and the other medical, known as a condition called hyperhidrosis. Excessive sweating becomes hyperhidrosis \u2014 a condition formally recognized by physicians \u2014 when a person begins to sweat excessively in normal, non-stressful, not-overly heated places or situations. Three percent of the population has hyperhidrosis, and physicians have developed several treatments to combat it. Hyperhydrosis affects three main parts, sometimes in combination with another: the hands, feet, and armpits.\n\n\u201cIn patients with hyperhidrosis, the autonomic stimulation of the sweat glands in response to stress is hyperactive,\u201d writes the Columbia Center for Hyperhydrosis. During hyperhdrosis, they write, \u201cnormal everyday encounters, such as taking notes in school, holding or shaking someone's hand are embarrassing.\u201d\n\nAccording to Puttgen, the causes behind hyperhidrosis remain largely unknown. \u201cThe cause of primary focal hyperhidrosis is not well understood but is thought to originate from overactivity of the sympathetic \u2018fight or flight\u2019 nervous system sending aberrant signals to the major sweat glands of the body,\u201d Puttgen said. That means that the part of the body that tries to cool itself off is doing its job but just never shuts off, much like a leaky faucet. Puttgen also says new evidence is currently emerging for a genetic basis of hyperhydrosis, and particular genes causing the condition have been identified.\n\nWhen is it time to see a physician?\n\n\u201cThere are few true medically worrisome [consequences] from increased sweating,\u201d Puttgen said. But when the sweat starts to impact your mental health, that\u2019s when it\u2019s time to seek help. \u201cIf people are exhibiting signs or symptoms of depression or social phobia, it is clearly time to intervene, but patients need to know that whatever level of sweating they have that bothers them and prevents them from enjoying life to the fullest deserves consultation with a physician.\u201d\n\nThe John Hopkins Center for Sweat Disorders lists several non-surgical treatments for hyperhidrosis. These include oral medications like pills, topical creams, Botox (injected into the hand, face or underarm multiple times), and electrical therapy.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "sweating hyperhydrosis", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Excessive sweating, which for many may cause embarrassment and ruin quality of life, is a condition physicians call hyperhydrosis.", "title": "Why Do Some People Sweat More Than Others?", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/sweat-set-what-causes-some-people-sweat-more-others-271950", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/03/21/shutterstock1281008151.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Excessive sweating, which for many may cause embarrassment and ruin quality of life, is a condition physicians call hyperhydrosis.", "title": "Why Do Some People Sweat More Than Others?", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/sweat-set-what-causes-some-people-sweat-more-others-271950", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/03/21/shutterstock1281008151.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/03/21/shutterstock1281008151.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Conditions", "published_time": "2014-03-21T15:48:44-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-03-21T15:48:43-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Excessive sweating, which for many may cause embarrassment and ruin quality of life, is a condition physicians call hyperhydrosis."}, "article_summary": "For example, it\u2019s well known that men\u2019s sweat glands tend to secrete more sweat than women\u2019s.\nYour body contains about two to five million sweat glands embedded into your skin and located all over your body.\nOverweight people sweat more because the body perceives them to need more sweat to cool down.\nSo what exactly causes some people to sweat more than others?\nAccording to John Hopkins pediatrician Dr. Kate Puttgen, excessive sweating can be \u201cpsychosocially isolating\u201d and debilitating, particularly for children and adolescents."}
