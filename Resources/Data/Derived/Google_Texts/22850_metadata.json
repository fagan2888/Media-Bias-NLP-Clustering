Defined contribution plans are allowed to select a \u201cqualified default investment\u201d in cases where participants are allowed to direct their own investments. Participants\u2019 assets will be invested in these investment vehicles if no affirmative election is made. The plan sponsor must give notice that describes the qualified default investment. This notice must be given to participants at least 30 days, but not more than 90 days, before the first day of the plan year. (Deadline for calendar-year plans was Dec. 1.) 4. Defined benefit plans are required to provide a funding notice explaining a statement of the plan\u2019s assets and liabilities, its funding status for the previous two years and certain other information and requirements. This notice must be provided to participants within 120 days after the end of the plan year, or if the plan is a small plan that covers fewer than 100 participants, notice must be provided by the due date of the Form 5500. For large (100 or more participants) calendar-year plans, notice must be provided by April 30, 2014.\n\n8. All discretionary amendments to qualified plans must be adopted no later than the end of the plan year in which they are adopted. Therefore, a calendar year plan that has implemented a change to its plan in 2013 will have to be amended by Dec. 31, 2013.
