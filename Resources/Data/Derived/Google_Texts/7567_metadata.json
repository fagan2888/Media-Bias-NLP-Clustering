Claudiu Lazaroaie, who heads the project at the Scientific Research Center for CBRN Defense and Ecology, said that manufacturing is expected to start next year and that thousands of the flak jackets in three different sizes will be produced. The respected center, which was founded in 1924, carries out scientific research for defense technology and equipment.\n\nFor now, Romania's female soldiers are forced to wear men's body armor in smaller sizes, even though their anatomy is different. For many women, that means wearing a standard issue vest that is tight across the torso and too loose around the middle, causing discomfort and offering less protection.\n\n\"Even if women and men have the same circumference around the torso, their body shape is different,\" said Claudia Niculescu, a senior scientist at the National Institute for Textiles and Leather, who is involved in the project.\n\nThe U.S. Army says that since 2013 it has provided its female soldiers a vest whose feature include narrower shoulders for the easier aiming of rifles, darting to accommodate the female chest, a shorter torso, greater adjustability for the waist and hips and a neck collar that accommodates the hair bun worn by some female soldiers.\n\n___\n\nAlison Mutler in Bucharest, Romania contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"zone": "world/articles", "keyword": "Associated Press", "title": "Romania to make special flak jackets for its female soldiers", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) \u2014 A Romanian research institute is developing a bulletproof vest for the growing number of female soldiers signing up to serve in the country's army.", "title": "Romanian research institute develops bulletproof vest for women", "url": "http://www.usnews.com/news/world/articles/2015/04/17/romania-to-make-special-flak-jackets-for-its-female-soldiers", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/57/21956a1ca503a795e7c3a036cd7159/media:ed2bab939e7646e4845a7f63f9cabe6fRomaniaFemaleFlakJacket.JPEG", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"title": "Romania to make special flak jackets for its female soldiers", "description": "BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) \u2014 A Romanian research institute is developing a bulletproof vest for the growing number of female soldiers signing up to serve in the country's army.", "card": "summary", "site": "@USNews"}, "site": "news", "date_published": "April 17, 2015", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "page_type": "article", "keywords": "Collections: World,Collections: Top News,Associated Press", "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) \u2014 A Romanian research institute is developing a bulletproof vest for the growing number of female soldiers signing up to serve in the country's army."}, "article_summary": "For now, Romania's female soldiers are forced to wear men's body armor in smaller sizes, even though their anatomy is different.\nThough the U.S. Army produces flak jackets for women, they are not common across the world, prompting the Romanian government to commission the project.\nThough the U.S. Army produces flak jackets for women, they are not common worldwide, prompting the Romanian government to commission the project.\n(AP Photo/Vadim Ghirda) The Associated PressBy NICOLAE DUMITRACHE, Associated PressBUCHAREST, Romania (AP) \u2014 A Romanian research institute is developing a bulletproof vest for the growing number of female soldiers signing up to serve in the country's army.\nThe U.S. Army says that since 2013 it has provided its female soldiers a vest whose feature include narrower shoulders for the easier aiming of rifles, darting to accommodate the female chest, a shorter torso, greater adjustability for the waist and hips and a neck collar that accommodates the hair bun worn by some female soldiers."}
