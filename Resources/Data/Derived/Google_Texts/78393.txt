Rocky Mountain National Park workers on Sunday removed the body of a man found in a tent at a backcountry camping site.

“His body was brought out this morning on a wheeled litter by park staff with assistance from Grand County Search and Rescue,” Kyle Patterson, a park spokeswoman, said in a news release Sunday.

The release didn’t say if the death was considered suspicious. Patterson couldn’t be reached for comment.

The man was found Saturday night on the west side of the park.

He will not be identified until his next of kin are notified, Patterson said.

This is a developing story that will be updated when more information is available.
