Young is serving his 21st term as Alaska\u2019s representative to the U.S. House of Representatives. He\u2019s its 1st ranking Republican member, and the 4th ranking overall member of the House of Representatives.\n\n\u201cI am an Old School. I believe in hard work, respect for life, respect for others and help one another whenever possible,\u201d Seaward said on his Facebook page.\n\nHe currently works as a security guard for Doyon, in Anchorage.\n\nSeaward outlines his candidacy and some of his positions on his Facebook page. https://www.facebook.com/davidseaward10\n\nTouting his own government experience as Seward\u2019s mayor, and its potential for positive economic growth, Seaward\u2019s top national issues include gun rights, which he believes are being eroded, personal freedoms (from governmental wiretapping), federal government \u201coverreach,\u201d and he favors further restrictions on abortion rights. Seaward asks voters to stand with him to stop \u201cbig corporate welfare\u201d and tax loopholes. He slams the Affordable Health Care Act as harming the 85 percent who already had insurance, and calls out President Barak Obama for saying how proud he was to serve on the Veterans Affairs Committee as a junior senator. He also calls out Bernie Sanders of Vermont for defending the Veteran\u2019s Administration scandal.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSeaward\u2019s term as mayor, and his relationship with the city manager and majority of other council members was rocky and conflict-ridden almost from day-one, when he replaced Mayor Willard Dunham in an election more about people\u2019s opposition to proposed \u201csin taxes\u201d on alcohol and tobacco than about the two candidates\u2019 positions on issues or character. In fact there was practically no campaign at all by either one.\n\nNot long into office, Seaward was officially sanctioned by the council for allegedly promoting his own support for the Jesse Lee Home renovation project while in Juneau, which was not on the city\u2019s capital improvements priority list. It was seen as potentially taking away from things considered to have a higher priority. Under the terms of the sanction, he was forbidden for a period of time from travelling from Seward on city business, or speaking to higher public officials. Seaward questioned established council policy frequently, often raising conflict of interest concerns that he defined more broadly than most of the others on council did.\n\nThe mayor frequently did attempt to speak out, and make proposals on behalf of Seward\u2019s under-privileged or less-represented populations, including small business, the poor, the homeless, and the disabled community, and the recreational needs of children.\n\nHis high point, or the one in which he took the most satisfaction, was probably Seaward\u2019s trip to Obihiro, Japan, as part of a Seward delegation to that sister-city, where he, and the visitors were treated like royalty, and the Obihiro delegation\u2019s trip to Seward.\n\nSeaward\u2019s campaign manager is Robert Eubank.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WPZOOM Framework 1.6.0", "og": {"site_name": "Seward City News", "description": "By Heidi Zemach for SCN - Former Seward City Mayor David Seaward says he is", "title": "Guess who's running for higher office?", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://sewardcitynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/SCNFBLogo-1.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-05-25T19:39:24-08:00", "url": "http://sewardcitynews.com/2014/05/guess-whos-running-for-higher-office/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://sewardcitynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/David-Seaward-e1401075521799-300x240.jpg", "description": "By Heidi Zemach for SCN \u2013 Former Seward City Mayor David Seaward says he is running for U.S. Congress on the Republican ticket against U.S. Congressman Don Young.\u00a0Young is serving his 21st term as Alaska\u2019s representative to the U.S. House of Representatives.
