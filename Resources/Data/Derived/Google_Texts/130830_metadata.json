But what happens to people who get sick with something that is not Ebola?\n\nDr. James Appel was trained in the Inland Empire, at the Loma Linda University School of Medicine. He\u2019s been working for Adventist Health International at hospitals in Chad for the last decade. Last week, Dr. Appel flew to Liberia to keep the doors open at Cooper Adventist, a small hospital in the capital, Monrovia, focusing on remaining available to patients with anything but Ebola. He talked Thursday morning with The California Report\u2019s Rachael Myrow.\n\nAppel described Liberia as \u201cshutting down\u201d around him. \u201cThere\u2019s a curfew that\u2019s been initiated. Many businesses are not open; all the schools are closed, government offices are closed,\u201d Appel told Myrow. \u201cSo for example our hospital is not getting paid by the insurance companies, because insurance companies are closed. The whole economy is coming to a standstill.\u201d\n\nAppel said that people are starting to think there will be food shortages. There\u2019s a \u201cprofound impact not just for those few patients effected by Ebola, but for the whole country,\u201d Appel said.\n\nMany public hospitals in West Africa are closing their doors or refusing new patients, Myrow noted, and asked Appel why the General Conference of 7th Day Adventists wanted to keep Cooper Adventist open.\n\n\u201cCooper has a history of not wanting to shut down during crisis situations,\u201d Appel said, adding that it stayed open during the Liberia\u2019s civil war. \u201cStaff feels that they have a mission, and that is to provide care to the Liberian people when no one else will.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhile Ebola is dramatically killing people in a way that catches the imagination,\u201d Appel said, still more people are dying from malaria or complications from emergency c-sections. \u201cWith all hospitals shut down because of the Ebola crisis, the death toll would soon far surpass anything that Ebola could do, just due to other normally treatable diseases,\u201d Appel noted.\n\nThe hospital is old and run down, he said, a very small, three story structure on a \u201ctiny parcel of land in the heart of the city.\u201d\n\nCooper Adventists cannot treat Ebola patients because they do not have the isolation facilities necessary. Appel said they refer any suspected Ebola patients to a bigger hospital. \u201cAnyone suspicious at all, we send them where they can get better care and where we will not be putting our other patients at risk,\u201dAppel said, adding there is only one lab in the country that can run tests for Ebola. All blood samples go there.\n\nAppel acknowledged his own fears in treating patients during the ongoing crisis.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t say I\u2019m not afraid,\u201d he said. \u201cIn all my medical training, there\u2019s only one thing that\u2019s ever scared me and that\u2019s Ebola \u2014 because it is so lethal and happens so quickly and there\u2019s no known treatment.\u201d But he quickly added that Ebola is not as contagious as people might think. The virus is not airborne. Transmission requires \u201cdirect physical contract with (a patient\u2019s) bodily fluids. If normal universal precautions are taken and you\u2019re very careful about screening patients and keeping yourself protected with gowns and gloves and masks, there\u2019s actually a low likelihood of you getting it.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "\"Staff feels they have a mission ... to provide care to the Liberian people when no one else will.\"", "contextly-page": "{\"title\":\"In Face of Ebola, California-Trained Doctor Treats Patients in Liberia\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/2014\\/08\\/21\\/in-face-of-ebola-california-trained-doctor-treats-patients-in-liberia\\/\",\"pub_date\":\"2014-08-21 11:53:42\",\"mod_date\":\"2014-08-21 12:33:55\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":20955,\"author_id\":\"240\",\"author_name\":\"Lisa Aliferis\",\"author_display_name\":\"Lisa Aliferis\",\"tags\":[\"Ebola\",\"Science\"],\"categories\":[\"Tests &amp; Treatments\"],\"image\":\"http:\\/\\/blogs.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/files\\/2014\\/08\\/453874026.jpg\"}", "og": {"site_name": "State of Health", "description": "\"Staff feels they have a mission ... to provide care to the Liberian people when no one else will.\"", "title": "In Face of Ebola, California-Trained Doctor Treats Patients in Liberia", "url": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/2014/08/21/in-face-of-ebola-california-trained-doctor-treats-patients-in-liberia/", "image": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/wp-content/uploads/sites/27/2014/08/453874026-640x424.jpg", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@kqedhealth", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@"}, "fb": {"app_id": 160023622793}, "keywords": "ebola,science", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Appel said they refer any suspected Ebola patients to a bigger hospital.\nMany businesses are not open; all the schools are closed, government offices are closed,\u201d Appel told Myrow.\nThere\u2019s a \u201cprofound impact not just for those few patients effected by Ebola, but for the whole country,\u201d Appel said.\nLast week, Dr. Appel flew to Liberia to keep the doors open at Cooper Adventist, a small hospital in the capital, Monrovia, focusing on remaining available to patients with anything but Ebola.\nHe\u2019s been working for Adventist Health International at hospitals in Chad for the last decade."}
