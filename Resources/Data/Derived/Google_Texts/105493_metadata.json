The women were found on a tree-lined, single-laned northern Luce County road which had become impassable. Wright, 56, and Roy, 52, had gone missing after a family visit and credit their 13-day survival in the Michigan woods to cheese puffs, eight boxes of Girl Scout cookies and snow.\n\nThe women had been visiting family in Ishpeming. They departed on April 10 with plans to say the night at a hotel in Mackinaw City the next day but never checked in. Instead, their Ford Explorer became stuck in the deep snow on Crisp Point Road, in a remote area located in Michigan\u2019s Upper Peninsula, just west of Lake Superior\u2019s Crisp Point Lighthouse by three miles. Although the sisters had working cell phones while they were stranded, they were unable to reach 911 due to lack of cell phone coverage in the area.\n\nDetective Sgt. Jeff Marker with the Michigan State Police told The Grand Rapids Press that when the women were discovered, they were wearing \u201cmultiple layers of clothes\u201d and \u201cwere rationing their food.\u201d He called the sisters\u2019 survival after being stranded for 13 days in the woods with only cheese puffs, cookies and snow, \u201cunbelievably remarkable.\u201d\n\nDuring the ordeal, says Marker, Wright, who lives in Oklahoma, and Roy, who lives in Nebraska, twice heard the sounds of something moving in the woods during the night. Their initial hope that they had been rescued dimmed when nobody appeared, leading the women to believe that bears were lumbering through the woods around them. When the Ford\u2019s battery died earlier in the week, the women made the life-saving decision to remain with their vehicle.\n\nThe Associated Press reports that the women were ultimately discovered at approximately 2:20 p.m. on Friday, the second day of searching, when a police helicopter pilot, who was halfway through his second hour of searching for the sisters, spotted a reflection from the Ford\u2019s windshield and landed. Police had been focusing on the area in which the sisters were stranded after seeing a post on Facebook by one of the women, who had asked a relative about Tahquamenon Falls, located near where they were discovered.\n\nMarker described the moment of the sisters\u2019 rescue from the Michigan woods to The Grand Rapids Press. He said that when his group of four from the police helicopter reached their location after a 25-minute hike, \u201c[the sisters] grabbed their purses.\u201d Wright also \u201cclutched onto her Bible and both women were very happy.\u201d When rescued, both women were in good condition, although weak.\n\nBecause of their fatigued state, police called for help to spare the women having to make the hike to the helicopter. Before police back-up arrived, a family from Grand Rapids pulled up on their four-wheelers and drove the sisters to the helicopter.\n\nThe women\u2019s family met the rescued sisters on the Luce County Airport. They were then taken to a hospital in Newberry, Michigan, to be evaluated and treated. Besides cookies, cheese puffs and snow, the women cite their love for their family and their faith in God, which allowed them to remain confident that they would survive the 13-day ordeal, as one of the main reasons for their survival after becoming stranded.\n\nBy Jennifer Pfalz\n\nSources:\n\nWGNTV\n\nMichigan Live\n\nMiami Herald\n\nImage by Ivo Ivov \u2013 Creativecommons Flickr License\n\nShare this: Print\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nPocket\n\nReddit\n\nEmail\n\nTwitter\n\nGoogle\n\nFacebook\n\nTumblr\n\n", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Guardian Liberty Voice", "description": "Michigan sisters Lee Wright and Leslie Roy were discovered on Friday after having been missing since April 11.
