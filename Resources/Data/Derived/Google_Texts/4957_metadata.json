The previous week he was 23-of-38 for 535 yards and five TDs in a 34-33 win over Lewis-Palmer.\n\nThe two games are ranked No. 5 and No. 6 all-time. Burke isn\u2019t the only D\u2019Evelyn player to be ranked in the top 10. The Jaguars have had several quarterbacks over the years who have put up big single-game numbers. Cody Marvel threw for 523 yards in 2011, Mark Schaffer had 486 in 2006, and Caleb Fleck had 461 in 2011.\n\nBurke is third in the state in total passing yards with 1,762 yards behind Holy Family\u2019s Chris Helbig (1,935) and Brown (1,929).\n\nTop 10 single-game passing yards", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "D'Evelyn,Owen Burke", "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "og": {"site_name": "Prepped", "description": "D'Evelyn junior QB Owen Burke has thrown for more than 500 yards twice this season -- the first time in state history that someone has done that in their career, let alone a season.", "title": "Football: D'Evelyn QB Owen Burke throws for 500-plus... again", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/preps/2014/10/04/football-develyn-qb-owen-burke-throws-500-plus/14266/", "image": "http://i1.wp.com/blogs.denverpost.com/preps/files/2014/10/owen-burke.jpg?fit=495%2C329", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "description": "D'Evelyn junior QB Owen Burke has thrown for more than 500 yards twice this season -- the first time in state history that someone has done that in their career, let alone a season.", "title": "Football: D\u2019Evelyn QB Owen Burke throws for 500-plus\u2026 again", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/preps/2014/10/04/football-develyn-qb-owen-burke-throws-500-plus/14266/", "image": "http://i1.wp.com/blogs.denverpost.com/preps/files/2014/10/owen-burke.jpg?fit=495%2C329", "creator": "@JoeNguyen", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "language": "en, sv", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "D'Evelyn junior QB Owen Burke has thrown for more than 500 yards twice this season -- the first time in state history that someone has done that in their career, let alone a season."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9746\"", "article_summary": "Top 10 single-game passing yards\nBurke is third in the state in total passing yards with 1,762 yards behind Holy Family\u2019s Chris Helbig (1,935) and Brown (1,929).\nD\u2019Evelyn junior QB Owen Burke has thrown for more than 500 yards twice this season \u2014 the first time in state history that someone has done that in their career, let alone a season.\nThe Jaguars have had several quarterbacks over the years who have put up big single-game numbers.\nThe 2014 season has yielded four of the all-time top 10 most passing yards in a game, including Air Academy\u2019s Adam Brown\u2019s record-setting 589 yards against Sand Creek."}
