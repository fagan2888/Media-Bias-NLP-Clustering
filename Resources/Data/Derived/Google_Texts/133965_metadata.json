But Adrian Gore, the chief executive and founder of Vitality's parent group, said in the article that only the health services firm Vitality Group sees the individual fitness achievements and participation data, and then sends reports based on aggregated information.\n\nThe WSJ points out that companies spent an average $693 per employee on wellness incentives last year, up from $594 in 2014, and the Apple Watch program could have an individual impact of up to $1,460 annually.\n\nMajor insurers including Humana and UnitedHealth are also encouraging members to use wearable devices to improve their health.\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- here is the WSJ article (subscription may be required)\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nStudy: Financial-loss incentives most effective at encouraging weight loss\n\nWatch users claim Apple wearable improves health\n\nPrivacy concerns arise when wellness programs share data with vendors\n\nHumana encourages members to use wearable technology to improve health\n\nUnitedHealth debuts wellness program tied to fitness trackers", "article_metadata": {"description": "As wellness programs become ever more popular with employers hoping to control the cost of health insurance, some U.S. companies are turning to a program that encourages healthy behavior through the use of an Apple Watch, the\u00a0Wall Street Journal\u00a0reports.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthPayer", "description": "As wellness programs become ever more popular with employers hoping to control the cost of health insurance, some U.S. companies are turning to a program that encourages healthy behavior through the use of an Apple Watch, the\u00a0Wall Street Journal\u00a0reports.", "title": "Wellness program uses incentive of low-cost Apple Watch", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthpayer.com/story/wellness-program-uses-incentive-low-cost-apple-watch/2016-03-04", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthpayer.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "healthpayer", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "keywords": "Apple watch,Employee Wellness Programs,Financial Incentives,Health Information Technology,HR & Workforce Management,incentives,Marketing & Consumer Engagement,UnitedHEalth Group,wellness programs", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Health Information Technology,HR & Workforce Management,Marketing & Consumer Engagement"}, "article_summary": "As FierceHealthPayer previously reported, there are privacy concerns about workplace wellness programs that share employees' information with outside vendors.\nThe WSJ points out that companies spent an average $693 per employee on wellness incentives last year, up from $594 in 2014, and the Apple Watch program could have an individual impact of up to $1,460 annually.\nAs wellness programs become ever more popular with employers hoping to control the cost of health insurance, some U.S. companies are turning to a program that encourages healthy behavior through the use of an Apple Watch, the Wall Street Journal reports.\nThe program's incentive structure builds off recent research that found employees are more likely to participate in wellness programs if the consequence of not participating involves losing a reward rather than positive reinforcement for good behavior.\nTo learn more:- here is the WSJ article (subscription may be required)Related Articles:Study: Financial-loss incentives most effective at encouraging weight lossWatch users claim Apple wearable improves healthPrivacy concerns arise when wellness programs share data with vendorsHumana encourages members to use wearable technology to improve healthUnitedHealth debuts wellness program tied to fitness trackers"}
