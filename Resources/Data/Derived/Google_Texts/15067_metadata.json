(Usually this means sexually active woman age 25 or younger.) The downside: More than half of Americans still aren\u2019t getting these critical sexual health services, according to the National Coalition for Sexual Health.\n\nWhy? For one, many women think, \u201cI was tested a year ago, and was negative, and I\u2019m sure my boyfriend has been faithful,\u201d says H. Hunter Handsfield, M.D., a professor emeritus at the University of Washington Center for AIDS and STD. What many women don\u2019t realize: These problems are common\u2014and \u201cbad outcomes are more common in females than in males\u201d when it comes to STDs, Handsfield adds.\n\nRELATED: 7 Conversations You Must Have for a Healthy Sex Life\n\nBut even more worrisome is this: \u201cThe large majority of human infections are asymptomatic. For every person with strep throat and a sore throat, there are a large number of other people who have strep in their throat and don\u2019t get sick,\u201d says Handsfield. \u201cIt\u2019s the same with STDs.\u201d\n\nThat means it\u2019s critical to seek screenings (annually or every couple of years, depending on your age and sexual habits)\u2014especially for these \u201csleeper\u201d STDS, which often show no signs of infection. [Tweet this!]\n\nChlamydia\n\nAs few as 5 percent of women with chlamydia develop symptoms, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reports. And even if you do develop symptoms, they can be so non-specific\u2014increased vaginal discharge or burning\u2014that you may not suspect an STD, he says. But chlamydia is one of the most common curable STDs, says Patricia Elliott, Ph.D., a clinical assistant professor at the Boston University School of Public Health. And if left undetected, the infection can spread to your uterus and fallopian tubes, and your body can create scar tissue, possibly leading to pelvic inflammatory disease, says Elliot. As a result, your fallopian tubes may become blocked, increasing your risk of infertility, chronic pelvic pain, or ectopic pregnancy. \u201cChlamydia can also lead to increased risk of contracting HIV if exposed,\u201d says Elliott. If you become pregnant, you can pass chlamydia onto your child during a vaginal birth, potentially leading to respiratory or eye infections in your baby.\n\nGonorrhea\n\nElliott estimates that half of cases in women are asymptomatic\u2014and if you do show signs, the infection may be mistaken for a bladder or vaginal infection, according to the CDC. That said, \u201cgonorrhea has a bit of a safety valve,\u201d says Handsfield, because when symptoms do develop, they\u2019re often severe enough\u2014in contrast to chlamydia\u2014prompting women to see a doctor. Like chlamydia, untreated gonorrhea can lead to pelvic inflammatory disease. And it's often severe: \u201cgonorrhea is a more inflammatory disease than chlamydia,\u201d says Hansfield. \u201cSo it causes a greater amount of tubal damage,\u201d potentially priming you for infertility or ectopic pregnancy. The bacteria can also spread to your bloodstream, leading to a specific type of arthritis or fatal infections of the heart valve (although rare), he says.\n\nRELATED: 6 Things You're Not Telling Your Doc But Should\n\nHPV\n\nHPV has become the common cold of STDs: It\u2019s the most rampant sexually transmitted infection in the United States, despite being one of the only ones you can get vaccinated against, according to the CDC. Even though many of us know we have it, there are still a large number of cases that go undetected. \u201cHPV usually goes away on its own,\u201d says Elliott. \u201cBut it can stay in your body for a long time and remain asymptomatic.\u201d\n\nBesides putting you at risk of genital warts, a lingering case of HPV can raise your odds of cervical cancer, as well as cancers of the throat, vulva, vagina, and anus. \u201cA woman who has HPV may not develop cancer for decades,\u201d says Elliott. But there\u2019s still a health risk associated with precancerous cells in your uterus. \u201cThese abnormal pap smears require colposcopy treatment, which involves surgically removing part of the cervix,\u201d says Handsfield. That can raise your risk of preterm delivery if you become pregnant.\n\nGenital Herpes\n\nYou probably expect to develop a nasty rash if you catch herpes, but the truth is, \u201cmost cases are asymptomatic or cause such mild symptoms that many patients don\u2019t realize anything is abnormal,\u201d says Handsfield. Even if you\u2019re totally symptom-free, you can transmit HSV2\u2014the virus known to cause genital herpes\u2014to your partner, he adds. The CDC doesn't currently recommend routine testing in symptom-free people, but if you suspect a partner had it or you've slept with multiple people, you should talk to your doctor about testing.\n\nWhy? If you don\u2019t manage herpes in its early phases\u2014remember, it\u2019s incurable\u2014you may be more prone to recurrent outbreaks. \u201cWomen have more painful outbreaks than men do,\u201d Handsfield says. And, scarily, you can pass the infection on to your baby during vaginal childbirth. \u201cNeonatal herpes is rare, but when it occurs, it often kills the baby,\u201d says Handsfield.", "article_metadata": {"description": "You may be infected with a sexually transmitted disease\u2014and be totally oblivious.", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"site_name": "Shape Magazine", "description": "\"Sleeper\" sexually transmitted diseases often show no symptoms at all but can still wreak havoc on your body.", "title": "You Could Have an STD and Not Know It", "url": "http://www.shape.com/lifestyle/sex-and-love/sleeper-stds-you-re-risk", "image": "http://images.shape.mdpcdn.com/sites/shape.com/files/styles/facebook_og_image/public/story/doctor-office-700.jpg?itok=2xJNNjLC", "type": "article"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, maximum-scale=1.0, initial-scale=1.0", "article": {"section": "Sex and Love", "published_time": "2014-05-19T13:39:47-05:00", "author": "Laura Tedesco"}, "theme-color": "#f50057"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca16f\"", "article_summary": "ChlamydiaAs few as 5 percent of women with chlamydia develop symptoms, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reports.\nWhat many women don\u2019t realize: These problems are common\u2014and \u201cbad outcomes are more common in females than in males\u201d when it comes to STDs, Handsfield adds.\nPolitics aside, there has been one undeniable upside to the Affordable Care Act: no-cost screenings for STDs (like chlamydia, gonorrhea, and HPV) for women with an increased risk of infection.\nAnd even if you do develop symptoms, they can be so non-specific\u2014increased vaginal discharge or burning\u2014that you may not suspect an STD, he says.\nGonorrheaElliott estimates that half of cases in women are asymptomatic\u2014and if you do show signs, the infection may be mistaken for a bladder or vaginal infection, according to the CDC."}
