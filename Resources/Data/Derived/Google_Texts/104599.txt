Pine Ridge Indian Reservation, SD

President Barack Obama has decided damage from May storms in the Oglala Sioux Tribe of the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation merit a major disaster declaration, allowing access to federal assistance.

Severe storms, straight-line winds, and flooding that occurred in the area from May 8-29 caused significant damage to homes and businesses.

Federal assistance options include grants for temporary housing and repairs, low-cost loans to cover uninsured property losses, and other individual and business programs that could help the tribe recover from the disaster.

Residents and business owners in the tribe can apply for assistance online or by calling 1-800-621-3362.
