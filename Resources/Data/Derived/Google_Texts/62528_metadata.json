He added that \"the attackers used sharp weapons and fled the scene immediately.\"\n\nThe Islamic State-linked Aamaq news agency said ISIS has claimed responsibility for the attack, according to the SITE Intelligence Group, which monitors militant websites. NPR could not independently verify the claim.\n\n\"IS has claimed responsibility for other attacks in Bangladesh, but the government has dismissed those claims, saying the Sunni extremist group has no presence in Bangladesh,\" the AP reported.\n\nThe ISIS claim said that Siddique was killed for \"calling for atheism,\" SITE reports. However, according to The New York Times, Siddique \"was not, like most of the previous victims, an avowed atheist or anti-religious campaigner.\"\n\nAs The Two-Way has reported, Bangladesh has seen a string of attacks against outspoken atheists and secularists. Earlier this month, a 28-year-old law student who sharply criticized radical Islam was hacked to death in Bangladesh's capital, Dhaka. Here's more from our earlier story:\n\n\n\n\"Last year, at least four secular bloggers were hacked to death in Bangladesh and a publisher who worked with one of those bloggers was stabbed to death. \"The government of Bangladesh \u2014 which is officially secular \u2014 has been criticized for failing to protect prominent secularists.\"\n\n\n\nAccording to the Dhaka Tribune, Siddique is now the fourth professor from Rajshahi University to be hacked to death in the last 12 years.\n\nThe newspaper described him as a quiet man who had positive relationships with other members of his community. It added that he \"used to play the flute and tamura.\"\n\nAccording to The New York Times, he had recently started a music school and \"was focused on introducing students to traditional Bangladeshi music and the poetry of literary figures like Rabindranath Tagore and Kazi Nazrul Islam.\"\n\nSpeaking to the BBC, Siddique's brother Sajidul said, \"So far as we know, he did not have any known enemies and we never found him worried. ... We don't know why it happened to him.\"\n\n", "article_metadata": {"category": "none", "description": "A university professor has been hacked to death in northwestern Bangladesh, and police said it resembled other recent militant attacks in the country.", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://wnpr.org/post/bangladeshi-professor-hacked-death-islamic-state-claimed-attack", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/wnpr/files/201502/wnpr-default-image.png", "type": "article", "description": "A university professor has been hacked to death in northwestern Bangladesh, and police said it resembled other recent militant attacks in the country.", "title": "Bangladeshi Professor Hacked To Death In Islamic State-Claimed Attack"}, "story_id": 475406593, "twitter": {"site": "@wnpr", "card": "summary", "creator": "@wnpr"}, "author": "Merrit Kennedy", "org_id": 1, "dc": {"title": "Bangladeshi Professor Hacked To Death In Islamic State-Claimed Attack"}, "nid": 57628, "datePublished": "2016-04-23", "wordCount": 483, "has_audio": 0, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "A university professor has been hacked to death in northwestern Bangladesh, and police said it resembled other recent militant attacks in the country.\nHowever, according to The New York Times, Siddique \"was not, like most of the previous victims, an avowed atheist or anti-religious campaigner.\"\nAccording to the Dhaka Tribune, Siddique is now the fourth professor from Rajshahi University to be hacked to death in the last 12 years.\nEarlier this month, a 28-year-old law student who sharply criticized radical Islam was hacked to death in Bangladesh's capital, Dhaka.\nHere's more from our earlier story:\"Last year, at least four secular bloggers were hacked to death in Bangladesh and a publisher who worked with one of those bloggers was stabbed to death."}
