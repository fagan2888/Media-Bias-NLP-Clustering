But if it ever takes effect, the employer mandate will also be a new barrier for businesses that want to expand. It means that your 50th full-time hire is your most expensive and will result in the greatest amount of government involvement in your life. As liberals warned when the Senate version of the ACA passed (the House version was different), it will especially discourage the hiring of people from poorer households who have families \u2013 the ones most in need of a job, but also most likely to qualify for subsidies and trigger fines for their employers.\n\nBut what's especially disturbing about the new delay is the accompanying threat to businesses that might now try to make arbitrary staffing changes to get below 100 employees and fit the in-between category created by the arbitrary rule-change. Employers will have to sign \u201cself-attestations\u201d that they did not act under the perverse incentives that Obama's new directive has created.\n\nIn practice, this directive probably doesn't amount to much. If your business hasn't already downsized, switched to part-time hires, or offered insurance in order to comply with Obamacare's requirements, it hardly seems worth it to fire a few people merely in order to avoid fines for a single year. But in principle, it's an outrage.\n\nEmployers generally get to decide, within the broad latitude of the law, how to run their businesses. The IRS has never had the power to demand a sworn explanation for decisions about manpower or staffing levels.\n\nThis arbitrary expansion of IRS power creates an ugly precedent. There exists no authority for it anywhere in Obamacare. Congress has never granted such authority. But then, Congress also didn't create authority for the arbitrary Obamacare deadline-change that supposedly justifies it.\n\nAlso from the Washington Examiner Obama: protesters make me a better president President Obama told Vietnamese activists in Hanoi on Tuesday that people like them have made him a better leader. The courageous work that they do is \"important everywhere, including, by the way, in the United States, where there are all sorts of activists and people who are mobilizing, [who] often times are very critical of me and don't always make my life comfortable but, ultimately, I think it's a better country and I do a better job as president because I'm subject to that accountability,\" Obama said. He encouraged the civil society leaders to continue pressuring their government to make reforms. \"Ultimately, it's up to the Vietnamese people to determine how their society functions and the nature of the\n\nEach executive power-grab creates a precedent for another. Obama isn't just making up the rules as he goes, he's also making up new rules that govern how the other made-up new rules apply.\n\nAt this point, it probably would not have mattered even if members of Congress had read Obamacare. It isn't actually a written law - it becomes the law whenever Obama decides, and with whatever changes he chooses.\n\nDAVID FREDDOSO, a Washington Examiner columnist, is the former Editorial Page Editor for the Examiner and the New York Times-bestselling author of \"Spin Masters: How the Media Ignored the Real News and Helped Re-elect Barack Obama.\" He has also written two other books, \"The Case Against Barack Obama\" (2008) and \"Gangster Government\" (2011).", "article_metadata": {"description": "During the original debate over Obamacare, we saw some of the perils behind amateur attempts to read and decipher complicated legislation.
