Lifting the ban is a recognition of surging U.S. oil production, which lowers the need to stock pile it and keep it from being sold overseas.\n\nIt will allow oil producers to ramp up output once prices rebound, creating more jobs and greater revenue. That's why Big Oil companies like ConocoPhillips (COP), Hess (HES) and Chesapeake Energy (CHK) have urged Congress to kill the ban.\n\nRefiners dodge a bullet\n\nRefiners opposed lifting the export ban because they had mostly exclusive access to U.S. crude oil. They were able to buy it at cheaper domestic prices and then sell it at higher global prices.\n\nThat gap created fat profits, which will likely disappear once producers can ship the oil overseas.\n\nHowever, refiners get tax credits in the bill, according to Chris Krueger, a senior policy analyst at Guggenheim Securities. That's great news for refiners like PBF Energy (PBF) and Marathon Petroleum (MPC), each of which saw their stock prices tick higher on Wednesday as details of the deal trickled out.\n\nSolar, wind\n\nThe solar industry may be the biggest winner, at least based on market reaction. Shares of Elon Musk's SolarCity (SCTY) skyrocketed 26% on Wednesday, while rivals SunPower (SPWR) and Sunedison (SUNE) enjoyed double-digit gains.\n\nWall Street cheered as the spending deal includes a five-year extension of a critical solar tax credit, which is known as the Solar Investment Tax Credit, or ITC.\n\n\"This is a huge extension that is far larger than we anticipated,\" said Krueger. The credit kicks in when construction of solar projects begin and not just when energy is produced.\n\nThe wind industry also won a five-year extension of tax credits. The news lifted shares of wind stocks like NextEra Energy (NEE), Broadwind (BWEN) and Ormat Technologies (ORA).\n\nMedical device makers\n\nUnder the budget deal, the 2.3% tax on medical device sales will be delayed for two years, which is great news for those who make them.\n\nThe tax was part of Obamacare and had been aimed at raising $29 billion over 10 years.\n\nHowever, the tax was strongly opposed by Medtronic (MDT), one of the leading makers of medical devices. Shares of Medtronic rose slightly on Wednesday.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "tax deal, winners, stocks, oil, solar, oil export ban, Obamacare, medical device tax, Congress, investing, Wall Street, Elon Musk, Solar City, Medtronic, oil export ban", "title": "Why oil is a big winner in Washington's budget deal", "og": {"site_name": "CNNMoney", "description": "The $1.1 trillion tax deal making its way through Congress would represent a big win for a number of industries, including oil and solar.", "title": "Why oil is a big winner in Washington's budget deal", "url": "http://money.cnn.com/2015/12/16/investing/tax-budget-deal-oil-solar-winners/index.html", "image": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/140411012802-us-capitol-washington-income-taxes-780x439.jpg", "type": "article"}, "section": "investing", "author": "Matt Egan", "vr": {"category": "investing", "type": "Article"}, "DC.date.issued": "2015-12-16T01:26:48", "keywords": "tax deal, winners, stocks, oil, solar, oil export ban, Obamacare, medical device tax, Congress, investing, Wall Street, Elon Musk, Solar City, Medtronic, oil export ban", "fb": {"app_id": 521848191196480}, "date": "2015-12-16 01:26:48", "twitter": {"description": "The $1.1 trillion tax deal making its way through Congress would represent a big win for a number of industries, including oil and solar.", "title": "Why oil is a big winner in Washington's budget deal", "url": "http://money.cnn.com/2015/12/16/investing/tax-budget-deal-oil-solar-winners/index.html", "image": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/140411012802-us-capitol-washington-income-taxes-540x304.jpg", "site": "@CNNMoney", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "viewport": "width=1140", "description": "The $1.1 trillion tax deal making its way through Congress would represent a big win for a number of industries, including oil and solar."}, "article_summary": "Solar, windThe solar industry may be the biggest winner, at least based on market reaction.\nWall Street cheered as the spending deal includes a five-year extension of a critical solar tax credit, which is known as the Solar Investment Tax Credit, or ITC.\nIf that happens, here are some of the biggest winners:Big OilThe hurting oil industry will mostly cheer passage of the so-called omnibus bill because it includes a provision that would lift the 40-year ban on exporting crude oil.\nThat's why Big Oil companies like ConocoPhillips (COP), Hess (HES) and Chesapeake Energy (CHK) have urged Congress to kill the ban.\nIt will allow oil producers to ramp up output once prices rebound, creating more jobs and greater revenue."}
