MADRID (AP) — Spanish director Carlos Vermut won this year’s top award for his film “Magical Girl” and also claimed the best director prize Saturday at Spain’s San Sebastian Film Festival.

The movie, a Spanish-French co-production starring Luis Bermejo, Jose Sacristan, Barbara Lennie and Lucia Pollan, is Vermut’s second feature film — after his debut with “Diamond Flash” — and is a crime drama in the film noir tradition, set in Madrid and with references to Japanese manga comics.

It tells the story of Alicia, a sickly child who dreams of a dress in a comic strip called “Magical Girl Yukiko.” Her father, Luis, will do anything to make his ailing daughter’s dreams come true, but the characters become enmeshed in a plot of blackmail and irresistible fate.

“Cinema is a trip you don’t embark upon alone,” said Vermut. “I ??like characters more than plots, and I’ve featured as a character in the previous award,” he said when presented with the best film statuette.
