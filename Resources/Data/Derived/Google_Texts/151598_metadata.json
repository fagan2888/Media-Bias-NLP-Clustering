In many ways, we\u2019re connected by a shared history, as both Arkansas and Oklahoma were once part of the same federal territory. We\u2019re still connected today as neighbors with shared values.\n\nBut neighbors help one another and as I see the Oklahoma Legislature considering a plan to \u201crebalance\u201d Medicaid, I want to help them avoid the same mistakes our state has made.\n\nLogin required We have used your information to see if you have a subscription with us.

This Medicaid expansion was a central piece of President Obama\u2019s disastrous \u201cObamacare\u201d program.\n\nIn 2013, our Democrat governor and his friends in the Legislature passed a Medicaid expansion to cover these able-bodied adults, promising that it would be a compassionate extension of our state\u2019s safety net to people in need. But our \u201cPrivate Option\u201d \u201cObamacare\u201d expansion has been a disaster for Arkansas taxpayers and has hurt the truly needy ever since.\n\nMore able-bodied adults have been added to the new welfare program than state officials thought would ever even be eligible, costs have soared above expectations, and the added burden on our state budget threatens the funding for critical services like education, public safety and infrastructure. Nearly 300,000 able-bodied adults have moved to the front of the line to sign up for this new program, while thousands of kids and adults with developmental disabilities still languish on Medicaid waiting lists for the critical services they desperately need.\n\nIn 2014, Arkansans elected a new Republican governor and gave Republicans their largest legislative majorities since Reconstruction. I hoped that we could come together and put an end to this dangerous \u201cObamacare\u201d expansion. Instead, pressure from special interests gave way to arm twisting, political dirty tricks and sneaky legislative maneuvers by Gov. Asa Hutchinson to pass a rebranded version of the failed \u201cPrivate Option.\u201d\n\nWe fell into this trap. Our decision will burden future generations with untold amounts of debt, make it harder for the truly needy to get the care they deserve and put other important state programs at risk. But you don\u2019t have to repeat our mistakes.\n\nOklahoma\u2019s Medicaid Rebalancing Act of 2020 could lead your state down the same dark road. Don\u2019t be fooled: dressing \u201cObamacare\u2019s\u201d Medicaid expansion up in its Sunday best doesn\u2019t make it a different program. Many of the proposed tweaks have made \u201cObamacare\u201d worse, not better.\n\nLike the Arkansas Medicaid expansion, Oklahoma\u2019s plan will extend Medicaid to a new class of able-bodied adults, with as many as 628,000 of them newly eligible for this new program. That\u2019s roughly the population of Oklahoma City and a huge increase in the amount of Oklahomans who would become dependent on government.\n\nHow are taxpayers supposed to fund this Medicaid expansion? Through new taxes, extra fees, and mythical \u201csavings.\u201d Besides a tax hike on tobacco sales, the plan could also levy a tax on health-care providers, which will surely be passed along to patients.\n\nThe list of empty promises made by Barack Obama about the benefits of \u201cObamacare\u201d is endless. He promised that you could keep your plan. He promised that the typical family would save thousands of dollars a year in lower premiums. These promises had no basis in reality \u2013 and neither do the promises coming from those seeking to \u201crebalance\u201d Medicaid in Oklahoma.\n\nDon\u2019t be fooled by the proposed Medicaid Rebalancing Act. It is merely a wolf in sheep\u2019s clothing. This new plan is \u201cObamacare\u201d expansion dressed up to disguise its true nature. From one neighbor to another, don\u2019t let your state make the same mistake we did. Stand on principle and reject this disastrous plan.", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "Tulsa World", "description": "Don\u2019t be fooled by the proposed Medicaid Rebalancing Act.
