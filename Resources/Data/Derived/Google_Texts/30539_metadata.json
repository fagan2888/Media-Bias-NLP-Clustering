The shelter looks absolutely amazing, and the changes in the animals are all positive. They are calmer (and quieter) in their new cages. It will really make a difference in their overall health and adoptability.\"\n\n\"It's a completely different building and it's awesome.\" said volunteer Barb Hannan of Elgin, who was working with the cats in their new living space. \"It's much better for everyone.\"\n\nIn addition to the shelter redesign, Anderson has also undergone a change in animal housing philosophy with many of the animals moved to foster homes to reduce the population at the shelter. With fewer animals to care for, shelter staff can focus on the individual needs of each animal.\n\n\"This means that our animals are emotionally and physically healthier, and this has had a positive impact on our adoptions,\" Drake said, nothing that since the policy change in June adoption rates have increased 40 percent.\n\nFor more information on the shelter, call (847) 697-2880.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Anderson Animal Shelter reopened Saturday following a comprehensive remodeling that began about three months ago.
