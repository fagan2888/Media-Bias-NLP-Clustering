She should take a class about the procedure and designate a family member to be her \u201ccoach\u201d to help with recovery. And if she had problems after surgery, she needed to call a 24-hour number at Angel\u2019s office rather than just go to the emergency room.\n\n\u201cWe have a program,\u201d Angel explained gently. \u201cBecause nobody wants to end up back in the hospital.\u201d\n\nThis comprehensive approach to patients \u2013 focused not just on what happens in the doctor\u2019s office but on how patients recover at home and how much their care costs \u2013 hasn\u2019t always been the rule in American healthcare.\n\nBut across the country, far from the vitriolic debate over Obamacare, it is driving a quiet revolution that is changing how doctors replace knees, communicate with patients, prescribe drugs, even deliver babies.\n\nFew places have embraced this revolution more fully than Arkansas, which embarked on one of the most sweeping efforts in the nation to improve healthcare quality and control costs.\n\n\u201cOur goal was to change the way people thought about stewardship of healthcare resources,\u201d said Dr. William Golden, the medical director of Arkansas\u2019 Medicaid program, a key player in the statewide effort. \u201cWe wanted to get people away from looking only at their little piece of the system.\u201d\n\nArkansans live on average nearly three fewer years than other Americans and five fewer years than the residents of top states such as Minnesota and Hawaii.\n\nBut unlike most unhealthy states, Arkansas moved aggressively to upgrade its healthcare system after President Obama signed the 2010 Affordable Care Act.\n\nDemocrats and Republicans in the statehouse undertook an unusual bipartisan initiative to broaden the state\u2019s Medicaid program through the health law. Since 2013, Arkansas has tied with Kentucky for largest percentage decline in uninsured.\n\nBy contrast, no other Southern state elected to guarantee its residents health insurance.\n\nLess noted, Arkansas state leaders also looked hard at how doctors and hospitals across the state were delivering care.\n\nwinnie abbott Melissa Sue Gerrits / For The Times Winnie Abbott underwent knee replacement surgery last year and her husband, John, a pastor at a local church, was assigned to be her \"coach\" helping with exercises and other tasks. \"It certainly changer our routine,\" said John of the recovery period at their home in Cave City, Ark.

(Melissa Sue Gerrits / For The Times) (Melissa Sue Gerrits / For The Times)\n\n\u201cEveryone recognized that we had to change,\u201d said Dr. Joe Thompson, the state\u2019s former surgeon general, who helped bring together insurers, doctors and leading employers, including Wal-Mart. \u201cQuite simply, the way we were paying wasn\u2019t getting us the results we wanted,\u201d he said.\n\nFor decades, Arkansas physicians, like doctors all over America, had been paid the same way: They billed for every patient visit and procedure. Whether patients got better or whether they ended up back in the hospital after surgery made no difference.\n\nArkansas decided to try something different.\n\nPrivate insurers, employers and the state Medicaid program agreed to pay primary care clinics a bonus if they could control the cost of care while hitting quality targets, such as ensuring diabetics got regular blood sugar tests and women got recommended cancer screenings.\n\nSimilarly, orthopedic surgeons, obstetricians and other providers would be rewarded based on the cost and outcomes of procedures they performed such as knee replacements, tonsillectomies and deliveries.\n\n\u201cArkansas is being much more innovative than many, many states,\u201d said Michael Chernew, a health economist at Harvard Medical School who is studying the coordinated state effort. \u201cIt\u2019s very ambitious.\u201d\n\nIn Batesville, an aging industrial town in the shadow of a hulking poultry plant, that meant some adjustments for Angel.\n\nThe 54-year-old surgeon had a busy orthopedic practice, with a steady flow of broken bones, sore backs and knee and hip replacements.\n\nHe worked to stay abreast of changes in healthcare. In an office decorated with Arkansas football paraphernalia, Angel works in front of a bank of computer screens, toggling between patients\u2019 medical records, electronic images of X-rays and communications with other providers.\n\nBut when replacing hips and knees, Angel had focused mainly on what he did in the operating room, leaving recovery and rehabilitation to others.\n\nUnder the new system, the state\u2019s largest insurers, Arkansas Blue Cross Blue Shield and Arkansas Medicaid, began tracking how many of Angel\u2019s patients contracted infections, how many suffered blood clots and how many were readmitted to the hospital.\n\nThe health plans also tallied the total bill for his patients\u2019 care, including not just his surgery, but any rehab, extra hospital stays or follow-up emergency care.\n\n\u201cWe were a little anxious at first,\u201d Angel said. \u201cWere we going to be able to perform? What if our patients didn\u2019t do what we said?\u201d\n\nAfter reviewing every part of their practice, Angel and his partners set up new protocols for all his patients.\n\nThey now require higher-risk patients to take steps to improve their health before surgery to reduce risk of complications. Obese patients are required to lose weight, for example. Diabetics have to control their blood sugar.\n\nThe doctors standardized procedures for managing patients\u2019 pain and planning their recovery, key steps that improve outcomes.\n\nAnd they set up the 24-hour hotline, so patients could call with questions about their recovery instead of heading to the emergency room, a costly and frequently unnecessary option that patients often used when they simply couldn\u2019t reach the doctor\u2019s office.\n\nAngel also reviewed which rehab facilities helped patients most; he cut places with the worst results and sent many patients directly home, a recovery option that research suggests is often better, as well as less costly.\n\nAt the same time, Angel scheduled more regular follow-up visits with all his patients after surgery to head off potential complications.\n\n\u201cWe feel like we have much more responsibility for the patient now,\u201d he said.\n\nAngel hasn\u2019t always hit all his targets. But he cut the share of his knee replacement patients who ended up back in the hospital nearly in half between 2013 and 2015 and cut readmissions for hip replacement patients more than 80%.\n\nwinnie abbott Melissa Sue Gerrits / For The Times Winnie Abbott sips water at El Acapulco in Cave City, Ark.
