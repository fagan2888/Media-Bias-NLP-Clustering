How many millions? The estimates vary. On the low end, 3 to 8 million, assuming some correlation to the potential beneficiaries of the president\u2019s already existing amnesty decrees (including DACA or Deferred Action on Childhood Arrivals). On the high end, as many as 9 to 34 million, factoring in likely categorical expansions of amnesty and their ramifications over the next several years.\n\nThe anxiety stems from a remorseless truth that no one \u2014 most especially Mr. Obama\u2019s most ardent detractors \u2014 wants to confront. It is the truth I have addressed, to much groaning and teeth-gnashing, in Faithless Execution, my recent book on presidential lawlessness.\n\nIt is this: The nation overwhelmingly objects to Obama\u2019s immigration lawlessness, but it has no stomach for the only effective counter to it \u2014 the plausible threat of impeachment.\n\nTo hear the demagogue-in-chief tell it, the controversy over how to deal with the approximately 12 million illegal aliens currently in the U.S. is a Manichean debate between enlightened humanitarians and vulgar xenophobes. (To be fair to the president, he is far from alone in peddling this smear.) But objections to Obama\u2019s reckless immigration policies \u2014 indeed, to his policies in general, as this week\u2019s historic election reaffirmed \u2014 cut across party and philosophical lines.\n\nTo be sure, the most intense protest is heard in \u201crestrictionist\u201d circles and among those for whom rule-of-law and national-security concerns trump sympathy for the plight of legions of decent but unlawfully present non-citizens (some of whom were brought here as children and are blameless for their illegal status). There are also, however, many enthusiasts of immigration amnesty \u2014 the euphemism is legislative \u201creform\u201d \u2014 who recognize that the president\u2019s sweeping, dictatorial approach is angering the public. That damages not just the cause but the career prospects of those who\u2019ve made the cause their own.\n\nSo, on immigration, the president has managed to unite much of the country . . . against him \u2014 who says he\u2019s divisive? Nevertheless, Obama made clear again this week that he intends to push ahead with massive amnesty by executive order. Further infuriating the public with his cynicism, he has strategically but quite openly delayed his directive until after the election, as if to say, \u201cThe rubes are too stupid to grasp what I\u2019m doing even when I make no secret of it!\u201d\n\nAs Faithless Execution recounts, the delegates at the 1787 Philadelphia convention included impeachment in the Constitution because they believed it to be \u201cindispensible\u201d (as Madison put it) to preventing the abuse of executive power. Congressional authority to remove a president would be a decisive check. Still, the Framers reckoned it would rarely be invoked.\n\nTo turn back most instances of executive overreach, less drastic remedies would do the trick. The ballot box, for one: The Framers high-mindedly assumed that an imperious, corrupt, or incompetent candidate would not be elected, much less reelected. In addition, the power of the purse would enable Congress to cut off the funds a president would need to carry out reckless or lawless enterprises; and requiring Senate approval of presidential appointments would give lawmakers additional leverage to bend the president into compliance with the law and the public will.\n\nBut here\u2019s the problem: Obama has no more elections to worry about; and, other than impeachment, the rest of the arsenal designed by the Framers is impotent when it comes to most of his immigration scheme.\n\nThat scheme implicates three closely related but importantly distinct considerations: the lawless status of the aliens in question; non-enforcement of the immigration laws against them; and the conferral of legal status on them. On the first two, the president\u2019s power to forgive law-breaking and refrain from law-enforcement is plenary. The abuse of these powers is essentially irresistible . . . except by impeachment. As for the third consideration, even though the president has no direct power to confer legal status or benefits (e.g., work permits) on aliens, that technical deficiency could be overcome by the abusive exploitation of the aforementioned powers he undeniably has.\n\nI acknowledge in Faithless Execution that to refrain from invoking impeachment as the credible threat the Framers intended it to be is a rational political choice. My point is that it is a choice fraught with consequences. We have to face those consequences. We don\u2019t get to avoid them by being reasonable, moderate people who recoil from the I-word. Nor, in the matter of illegal immigration, is there any funding cut or loopy congressional lawsuit that can dissuade this president. There is either a credible threat of impeachment or a transformational mass-amnesty. That\u2019s it.\n\nExecutive Order Confusion\n\nThe public debate over Obama\u2019s anticipated amnesty proclamation has wrongly focused on executive orders. So sullied has this term become that it is now a standard talking-point of Obama apologists that he has issued fewer such directives than his predecessors. It is a red herring.\n\nThere is nothing wrong in principle with an executive order \u2014 no more than there is with a statute. Congressional laws are problematic only when they exceed Congress\u2019s powers in violation of the Constitution. Same with executive orders: The president\u2019s powers are broad, the executive branch through which he exercises them is extensive, and there is consequently nothing improper in his issuance of executive orders to manage the conduct of legitimate executive functions \u2014 just as there is nothing invalid in Congress\u2019s enactment of statutes consistent with its capacious constitutional authorities or a court\u2019s issuing rulings within its proper jurisdiction.\n\nExecutive orders are offensive only when the president employs them to usurp the powers of the other branches \u2014 in particular, the legislative authority of Congress. If the president issued an executive order directing the IRS to collect taxes on a rate-schedule he unilaterally prescribed, that would be a serious violation of law. The fact that there was only one such executive order rather than, say, 500 would be quite beside the point.\n\nWith that backdrop, let\u2019s go back to our three considerations in the immigration context.\n\n1. Lawless Status of the Aliens.\n\nThe Constitution vests the president with \u201cPower to grant Reprieves and Pardons for Offenses against the United States.\u201d It is an awesome power \u2014 wholly unreviewable and nearly limitless \u2014 although one explicit limit is crucial, and we\u2019ll get to it in due course.\n\nAny offense against federal law is subject to pardon, and the Supreme Court has held since the Civil War that pardons remove \u201cany of the penalties and disabilities\u201d that would flow from a conviction. In fact, nothing in the Constitution prevents a president from pardoning his own law-breaking. The pardon power does not apply prospectively \u2014 the president may not license future law-breaking. But once the law has been broken, the president can pardon the offense; there is no need for an investigation to have occurred, much less a prosecution or conviction.\n\nPardons, moreover, need neither be individualized nor actually sought by the person to be pardoned. As George Mason law professor James Pfiffner recounts in the Heritage Foundation\u2019s excellent Guide to The Constitution, President Washington granted a blanket amnesty to collaborators in the Whiskey Rebellion; Presidents Lincoln and Johnson pardoned pro-Confederacy seditionists. On his first day in office in 1977, President Carter fulfilled a campaign promise by pardoning hundreds of thousands of Vietnam draft evaders.\n\nIt is occasionally claimed that illegal immigration is beyond the pardon power because it is \u201ccivil\u201d wrong not a criminal offense. This contention is largely incorrect, and it rests on a dubious assumption. Illegal entry into the United States is a criminal offense, albeit a misdemeanor. Reentry after deportation is a felony. And illegal aliens often commit various crimes to sustain their unlawful presence in our country. It is certainly true that an alien\u2019s being unlawfully present in the United States \u2014 for example, overstaying a visa or remaining here after illegally entering \u2014 is a civil violation, not a criminal one, but it is serious enough to render an alien deportable. The Constitution, in any event, enables a president to pardon federal \u201cOffenses\u201d \u2014 it does not say criminal offenses. While it is a reasonable deduction that the Framers\u2019 use of the word \u201coffense\u201d was meant to imply crimes, not civil wrongs, why should we assume that federal courts now stacked with Obama-appointed judges would see it that way? Why should the word offense be any less \u201corganic\u201d than, say, the term equal protection of the laws? Besides, the point of a blanket pardon would not be to confer lawful status on the aliens, something the president has no power to do. The point, as we shall see, would be to pave the way for the courts to finish the job.\n\nThus, fully within his constitutional authority, President Obama could, right this minute and without any congressional approval, pardon every illegal alien in the United States \u2014 indeed, every illegal alien anywhere who has been deported after violating federal law. He could do it by executive order and, while outrageous and condemnable, it would indisputably be within his Article II power. (As I have been pointing out since before Obama\u2019s 2008 election, his longtime friendship with former terrorist Bill Ayers is rooted in their shared radical notions about the American criminal-justice system \u2014 which Ayers, in a book Obama gushingly endorsed, condemned as the racist equivalent of Apartheid South Africa. If I were in Congress right now, I\u2019d be asking the Justice Department a lot of questions about preparations for pardons in Obama\u2019s last two years. If you\u2019re a convict not named Dinesh D\u2019Souza or Nakoula Basseley Nakoula, I imagine you\u2019ve got a shot.)\n\n2. Non-enforcement of the Immigration Laws\n\nAs I explain in Faithless Execution, while the Constitution grants much raw power to the president, it also constrains its exercise by placing limits on the legitimate uses of executive authority. A textbook example of illegitimate exercise of a legitimate power is Obama\u2019s abuse of prosecutorial discretion.\n\nProsecution is an awesome executive power. The Framers realized that, throughout history, the joinder in a single official or governing body of the powers to make law and to prosecute was the road to tyranny. So they took pains to separate legislative and prosecutorial authority. The executive branch was given plenary authority over federal law-enforcement: It is entirely up to the president and his Justice Department subordinates to decide what offenses and offenders will be investigated and prosecuted. Congress can try to pressure and prod, but it has no ability to coerce the Justice Department to enforce laws. (It is worth noting that the just-described sweep of the pardon power similarly reflects the Framers\u2019 purposes to divide law-making from law-enforcement and to check potential legislative overreach.)\n\nPre-Obama, prosecutorial discretion was understood as an unremarkable resource-allocation doctrine specific to the criminal law. Enforcement resources are finite. It is neither possible nor desirable to prosecute every single violation of law. Therefore, policymakers, prosecutors, and police must exercise judgment about which violations merit attention and which ones can be overlooked. Mind you, the overlooking does not excuse the law-breaking; it is simply a concession to reality \u2014 there are more pressing threats to society than pot-smoking, petty fraud, etc.\n\nObama, however, has contorted prosecutorial discretion into a license to ignore, \u201cwaive,\u201d rewrite, and otherwise violate congressional statutes \u2014 including laws such as the Affordable Care Act that are far afield from criminal-law enforcement. In sum, \u201cprosecutorial discretion\u201d has become the camouflage for Obama\u2019s usurpation of the powers to write and conclusively interpret the law \u2014 powers the Constitution vests in Congress and the courts.\n\nFaithless Execution outlines a litany of Obama-administration directives that the immigration laws go unenforced. In combination, they already amount to a large-scale amnesty. This, like abuse of the pardon power, can rightly be described as outrageous and condemnable. But, once again, such executive orders are indisputably within the president\u2019s Article II power in the sense that neither Congress nor the courts can compel him to enforce the law.\n\n3. Conferral of Legal Status\n\nUnder the Constitution, the power to determine the qualifications for American citizenship is legislative. Obviously, Congress\u2019s prescriptions must be signed by the president to become law (unless lawmakers have the numbers to override a veto). The president, however, has absolutely no authority to confer legal status or positive benefits (e.g., work permits) on aliens who are in the United States illegally. If the president attempts to do this by executive order \u2014 and, as Faithless Execution recounts, Obama has already done it, albeit on smaller scales than what is now being contemplated \u2014 that would patently exceed his authority, in violation of both the Constitution and statutory law.\n\nBut it is never that simple, is it? Let\u2019s say Obama pardoned some millions of illegal aliens. The effect of a pardon is to expunge a violation of the law and its attendant effects. In the eyes of the law, it is as if the offense never happened.\n\nWell, the legal and moral case against conferring legal status on illegal aliens is that doing so would excuse their law-breaking, encourage more law-breaking, and give the lawbreakers an unfair preference over aliens who have tried to immigrate lawfully. But a pardon would thrust us into a legal fiction in which we\u2019d have to pretend that the aliens had never broken our immigration laws in the first place. What, then, would remain of the rationale for complaining about the preference given law-breakers over law-abiding aliens? Or for continuing to saddle the aliens with illegal status? Anyone want to bet me on how the nearly 400 judges Obama will have put on the federal bench by 2017 would come out on those questions?\n\nIf the president refuses to enforce the immigration laws and grants something close to a blanket amnesty, we will be on an inexorable course toward citizenship \u2014 and, crucially, voting rights \u2014 for millions of illegal aliens, also known as Democrats waiting to happen. It is the Left\u2019s dream of a permanent, unassimilated, post-American governing majority.\n\nIs that where we are headed?\n\nAbuse of Power and Impeachment\n\nAs we noted earlier, the president\u2019s pardon power is nearly limitless. There is a single exception, explicit in the Constitution\u2019s Article II, Section 2: \u201cCases of Impeachment.\u201d\n\nThe president can prevent incarceration and other legal punishments for any unlawful acts; but he cannot prevent impeachment \u2014 his own or any other official\u2019s \u2014 based on the abuses of power that flow from those acts. Impeachment is a political remedy, not a legal one. It is about the removal of political power because of breaches of the public trust, not legal prosecution and punishment. Indeed, the Framers considered narrowing the pardon power to prevent the president from granting amnesty for his own lawlessness; they opted against it precisely because they believed the specter of impeachment would be sufficient disincentive.\n\nAs we\u2019ve seen, the president\u2019s pardon and prosecutorial powers are formidable. They do not, however, exist in a vacuum. They exist in a constitutional framework wherein the president\u2019s core duties are to execute the laws faithfully and preserve our system of government. The fact that an act is within a president\u2019s vast lawful power does not make it a faithful, constitutionally legitimate use of that power. As Faithless Execution elaborates, an act need not be criminal or indictable in order to be impeachable. There is far more to fiduciary responsibility than acting within the margins of technical legality.\n\nTo offer an analogy, a judge who sentenced a defendant to 20 years\u2019 imprisonment for handing someone a single marijuana cigarette would be imposing a legal sentence (i.e., within the governing statute) but would demonstrate himself unfit to be a judge. Likewise, lawmakers have the power to impose a 100 percent tax on income, but doing so would be an intolerable abuse of power. Similarly, a president who uses the pardon power and prosecutorial discretion as pretexts for usurping Congress\u2019s power to make immigration law, for encouraging law-breaking, and for remaking the country in a manner that imperils the economic and security interests of American citizens, commits grievous impeachable offenses.\n\nTo be blunt, there is no real power-of-the-purse check on the president\u2019s pardon power. Congress could threaten to withhold funds necessary for other Obama agenda items in an effort to discourage a blanket amnesty \u2014 although it would not be a very credible threat with the soon-to-be Senate majority leader having already pledged to refrain from using Congress\u2019s control of the purse-strings as leverage. But let\u2019s face it: While many of his abuses of power cannot happen without congressional funding, the president doesn\u2019t need a dime to pardon people. He doesn\u2019t even need his phone \u2014 just his pen.\n\nThe only real check on the pardon power is impeachment.\n\nAt this point, would a credible threat of impeachment be much of a check on this president\u2019s designs? I\u2019m not sure. Obama\u2019s stated goal is fundamental transformation of the nation, and a blanket amnesty would accomplish that. From his standpoint, it might be worth the risk. Plus, even if the amnesty suddenly ignited public sentiment for the president\u2019s removal from office (a dubious supposition), nothing in Washington happens quickly. Obama would still have many months if not most of the rest of his term to abuse his awesome powers (including by issuing additional pardons) in transformational ways.\n\nBut I do know this: Absent a credible threat of impeachment, President Obama cannot and will not be stopped from granting amnesty to millions of illegal aliens, who will in short order be awarded citizenship and voting rights. You can call that a plea for impeachment if you\u2019d like. I call it a statement of fact.\n\n\u2014 Andrew C. McCarthy is a policy fellow at the National Review Institute.

Let\u2019s say Obama pardoned some millions of illegal aliens. The effect of a pardon is to expunge a violation of the law and its attendant effects. In the eyes of the law, it is as if the offense never happened.\n\nWell, the legal and moral case against conferring legal status on illegal aliens is that doing so would excuse their law-breaking, encourage more law-breaking, and give the lawbreakers an unfair preference over aliens who have tried to immigrate lawfully. But a pardon would thrust us into a legal fiction in which we\u2019d have to pretend that the aliens had never broken our immigration laws in the first place. What, then, would remain of the rationale for complaining about the preference given law-breakers over law-abiding aliens? Or for continuing to saddle the aliens with illegal status? Anyone want to bet me on how the nearly 400 judges Obama will have put on the federal bench by 2017 would come out on those questions?\n\nIf the president refuses to enforce the immigration laws and grants something close to a blanket amnesty, we will be on an inexorable course toward citizenship \u2014 and, crucially, voting rights \u2014 for millions of illegal aliens, also known as Democrats waiting to happen. It is the Left\u2019s dream of a permanent, unassimilated, post-American governing majority.\n\nIs that where we are headed?\n\nAbuse of Power and ImpeachmentAs we noted earlier, the president\u2019s pardon power is nearly limitless. There is a single exception, explicit in the Constitution\u2019s Article II, Section 2: \u201cCases of Impeachment.\u201d\n\nThe president can prevent incarceration and other legal punishments for any unlawful acts; but he cannot prevent impeachment \u2014 his own or any other official\u2019s \u2014 based on the abuses of power that flow from those acts. Impeachment is a political remedy, not a legal one. It is about the removal of political power because of breaches of the public trust, not legal prosecution and punishment. Indeed, the Framers considered narrowing the pardon power to prevent the president from granting amnesty for his own lawlessness; they opted against it precisely because they believed the specter of impeachment would be sufficient disincentive.\n\nAs we\u2019ve seen, the president\u2019s pardon and prosecutorial powers are formidable. They do not, however, exist in a vacuum. They exist in a constitutional framework wherein the president\u2019s core duties are to execute the laws faithfully and preserve our system of government. The fact that an act is within a president\u2019s vast lawful power does not make it a faithful, constitutionally legitimate use of that power. As Faithless Execution elaborates, an act need not be criminal or indictable in order to be impeachable. There is far more to fiduciary responsibility than acting within the margins of technical legality.\n\nTo offer an analogy, a judge who sentenced a defendant to 20 years\u2019 imprisonment for handing someone a single marijuana cigarette would be imposing a legal sentence (i.e., within the governing statute) but would demonstrate himself unfit to be a judge. Likewise, lawmakers have the power to impose a 100 percent tax on income, but doing so would be an intolerable abuse of power. Similarly, a president who uses the pardon power and prosecutorial discretion as pretexts for usurping Congress\u2019s power to make immigration law, for encouraging law-breaking, and for remaking the country in a manner that imperils the economic and security interests of American citizens, commits grievous impeachable offenses.\n\nTo be blunt, there is no real power-of-the-purse check on the president\u2019s pardon power. Congress could threaten to withhold funds necessary for other Obama agenda items in an effort to discourage a blanket amnesty \u2014 although it would not be a very credible threat with the soon-to-be Senate majority leader having already pledged to refrain from using Congress\u2019s control of the purse-strings as leverage. But let\u2019s face it: While many of his abuses of power cannot happen without congressional funding, the president doesn\u2019t need a dime to pardon people. He doesn\u2019t even need his phone \u2014 just his pen.\n\nThe only real check on the pardon power is impeachment.\n\nAt this point, would a credible threat of impeachment be much of a check on this president\u2019s designs? I\u2019m not sure. Obama\u2019s stated goal is fundamental transformation of the nation, and a blanket amnesty would accomplish that. From his standpoint, it might be worth the risk. Plus, even if the amnesty suddenly ignited public sentiment for the president\u2019s removal from office (a dubious supposition), nothing in Washington happens quickly. Obama would still have many months if not most of the rest of his term to abuse his awesome powers (including by issuing additional pardons) in transformational ways.\n\nBut I do know this: Absent a credible threat of impeachment, President Obama cannot and will not be stopped from granting amnesty to millions of illegal aliens, who will in short order be awarded citizenship and voting rights. You can call that a plea for impeachment if you\u2019d like. I call it a statement of fact.\n\n\u2014 Andrew C. McCarthy is a policy fellow at the National Review Institute. His latest book is\u00a0Faithless Execution: Building the Political Case for Obama\u2019s Impeachment.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "title": "| National Review", "og": {"site_name": "National Review Online", "description": "There is high anxiety over President Obama\u2019s impending unilateral amnesty order for millions of illegal aliens. How many millions? The estimates vary. On the low end, 3 to 8 million, assuming some correlation to the potential beneficiaries of the president\u2019s already existing amnesty decrees (including DACA or Deferred Action on Childhood Arrivals). On the high end, as many as 9 to 34 million, factoring in likely categorical expansions of amnesty and their ramifications over the next several years.\n\nThe anxiety stems from a remorseless truth that no one \u2014 most especially Mr. Obama\u2019s most ardent detractors \u2014 wants to confront. It is the truth I have addressed, to much groaning and teeth-gnashing, in Faithless Execution, my recent book on presidential lawlessness.\n\nIt is this: The nation overwhelmingly objects to Obama\u2019s immigration lawlessness, but it has no stomach for the only effective counter to it \u2014 the plausible threat of impeachment.#ad#\n\nTo hear the demagogue-in-chief tell it, the controversy over how to deal with the approximately 12 million illegal aliens currently in the U.S. is a Manichean debate between enlightened humanitarians and vulgar xenophobes. (To be fair to the president, he is far from alone in peddling this smear.) But objections to Obama\u2019s reckless immigration policies \u2014 indeed, to his policies in general, as this week\u2019s historic election reaffirmed \u2014 cut across party and philosophical lines.\n\nTo be sure, the most intense protest is heard in \u201crestrictionist\u201d circles and among those for whom rule-of-law and national-security concerns trump sympathy for the plight of legions of decent but unlawfully present non-citizens (some of whom were brought here as children and are blameless for their illegal status). There are also, however, many enthusiasts of immigration amnesty \u2014 the euphemism is legislative \u201creform\u201d \u2014 who recognize that the president\u2019s sweeping, dictatorial approach is angering the public. That damages not just the cause but the career prospects of those who\u2019ve made the cause their own.\n\nSo, on immigration, the president has managed to unite much of the country\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0against him \u2014 who says he\u2019s divisive? Nevertheless, Obama made clear again this week that he intends to push ahead with massive amnesty by executive order. Further infuriating the public with his cynicism, he has strategically but quite openly delayed his directive until after the election, as if to say, \u201cThe rubes are too stupid to grasp what I\u2019m doing even when I make no secret of it!\u201d\n\nAs Faithless Execution recounts, the delegates at the 1787 Philadelphia convention included impeachment in the Constitution because they believed it to be \u201cindispensible\u201d (as Madison put it) to preventing the abuse of executive power. Congressional authority to remove a president would be a decisive check. Still, the Framers reckoned it would rarely be invoked.\n\nTo turn back most instances of executive overreach, less drastic remedies would do the trick. The ballot box, for one: The Framers high-mindedly assumed that an imperious, corrupt, or incompetent candidate would not be elected, much less reelected. In addition, the power of the purse would enable Congress to cut off the funds a president would need to carry out reckless or lawless enterprises; and requiring Senate approval of presidential appointments would give lawmakers additional leverage to bend the president into compliance with the law and the public will.\n\nBut here\u2019s the problem: Obama has no more elections to worry about; and, other than impeachment, the rest of the arsenal designed by the Framers is impotent when it comes to most of his immigration scheme.\n\nThat scheme implicates three closely related but importantly distinct considerations: the lawless status of the aliens in question; non-enforcement of the immigration laws against them; and the conferral of legal status on them. On the first two, the president\u2019s power to forgive law-breaking and refrain from law-enforcement is plenary. The abuse of these powers is essentially irresistible\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0except by impeachment. As for the third consideration, even though the president has no direct power to confer legal status or benefits (e.g., work permits) on aliens, that technical deficiency could be overcome by the abusive exploitation of the aforementioned powers he undeniably has.\n\nI acknowledge in Faithless Execution that to refrain from invoking impeachment as the credible threat the Framers intended it to be is a rational political choice. My point is that it is a choice fraught with consequences. We have to face those consequences. We don\u2019t get to avoid them by being reasonable, moderate people who recoil from the I-word. Nor, in the matter of illegal immigration, is there any funding cut or loopy congressional lawsuit that can dissuade this president. There is either a credible threat of impeachment or a transformational mass-amnesty. That\u2019s it.\n\n#page#\n\nExecutive Order ConfusionThe public debate over Obama\u2019s anticipated amnesty proclamation has wrongly focused on executive orders. So sullied has this term become that it is now a standard talking-point of Obama apologists that he has issued fewer such directives than his predecessors. It is a red herring.\n\nThere is nothing wrong in principle with an executive order \u2014 no more than there is with a statute. Congressional laws are problematic only when they exceed Congress\u2019s powers in violation of the Constitution. Same with executive orders: The president\u2019s powers are broad, the executive branch through which he exercises them is extensive, and there is consequently nothing improper in his issuance of executive orders to manage the conduct of legitimate executive functions \u2014 just as there is nothing invalid in Congress\u2019s enactment of statutes consistent with its capacious constitutional authorities or a court\u2019s issuing rulings within its proper jurisdiction.#ad#\n\nExecutive orders are offensive only when the president employs them to usurp the powers of the other branches \u2014 in particular, the legislative authority of Congress. If the president issued an executive order directing the IRS to collect taxes on a rate-schedule he unilaterally prescribed, that would be a serious violation of law. The fact that there was only one such executive order rather than, say, 500 would be quite beside the point.\n\nWith that backdrop, let\u2019s go back to our three considerations in the immigration context.\n\n1. Lawless Status of the Aliens.The Constitution vests the president with \u201cPower to grant Reprieves and Pardons for Offenses against the United States.\u201d It is an awesome power \u2014 wholly unreviewable and nearly limitless \u2014 although one explicit limit is crucial, and we\u2019ll get to it in due course.\n\nAny\u00a0offense against federal law is subject to pardon, and the Supreme Court has held since the Civil War that pardons remove \u201cany of the penalties and disabilities\u201d that would flow from a conviction. In fact, nothing in the Constitution prevents a president from pardoning his own law-breaking. The pardon power does not apply prospectively \u2014 the president may not license future law-breaking. But once the law has been broken, the president can pardon the offense; there is no need for an investigation to have occurred, much less a prosecution or conviction.\n\nPardons, moreover, need neither be individualized nor actually sought by the person to be pardoned. As George Mason law professor James Pfiffner recounts in the Heritage Foundation\u2019s excellent Guide to The Constitution, President Washington granted a blanket amnesty to collaborators in the Whiskey Rebellion; Presidents Lincoln and Johnson pardoned pro-Confederacy seditionists. On his first day in office in 1977, President Carter fulfilled a campaign promise by pardoning hundreds of thousands of Vietnam draft evaders.\u00a0\n\nIt is occasionally claimed that illegal immigration is\u00a0beyond the pardon power\u00a0because it is \u201ccivil\u201d wrong not a criminal offense. This contention is largely incorrect, and it rests on a dubious assumption. Illegal entry into the United States\u00a0is\u00a0a criminal offense, albeit a misdemeanor. Reentry after deportation is a felony. And illegal aliens often\u00a0commit various crimes\u00a0to sustain their unlawful presence in our country. It is certainly true that an alien\u2019s being unlawfully present in the United States \u2014 for example, overstaying a visa or remaining here after illegally entering \u2014 is a civil violation, not a criminal one, but it is serious enough to render an alien deportable. The Constitution, in any event, enables a president to pardon federal \u201cOffenses\u201d \u2014 it does not say\u00a0criminal\u00a0offenses. While it is a reasonable deduction that the Framers\u2019 use of the word \u201coffense\u201d was meant to imply\u00a0crimes, not civil wrongs, why should we assume that federal courts now stacked with Obama-appointed judges would see it that way? Why should the word\u00a0offense\u00a0be any less \u201corganic\u201d than, say, the term equal protection of the laws? Besides, the point of a blanket pardon would not be to confer lawful status on the aliens, something the president has no power to do. The point, as we shall see, would be to pave the way for the courts to finish the job.\n\nThus, fully within his constitutional authority, President Obama could, right this minute and without any congressional approval, pardon every illegal alien in the United States \u2014 indeed, every illegal alien anywhere who has been deported after violating federal law. He could do it by executive order and, while outrageous and condemnable, it would indisputably be within his Article II power. (As I have been pointing out since before Obama\u2019s 2008 election, his longtime friendship with former terrorist Bill Ayers is rooted in their shared radical notions about the American criminal-justice system \u2014 which Ayers, in a book Obama gushingly endorsed, condemned as the racist equivalent of Apartheid South Africa. If I were in Congress right now, I\u2019d be asking the Justice Department a lot of questions about preparations for pardons in Obama\u2019s last two years. If you\u2019re a convict not named Dinesh D\u2019Souza or Nakoula Basseley Nakoula, I imagine you\u2019ve got a shot.)\n\n2. Non-enforcement of the Immigration LawsAs I explain in Faithless Execution, while the Constitution grants much raw power to the president, it also constrains its exercise by placing limits on the legitimate uses of executive authority. A textbook example of illegitimate exercise of a legitimate power is Obama\u2019s abuse of prosecutorial discretion.\n\nProsecution is an awesome executive power. The Framers realized that, throughout history, the joinder in a single official or governing body of the powers to make law and to prosecute was the road to tyranny. So they took pains to separate legislative and prosecutorial authority. The executive branch was given plenary authority over federal law-enforcement: It is entirely up to the president and his Justice Department subordinates to decide what offenses and offenders will be investigated and prosecuted. Congress can try to pressure and prod, but it has no ability to coerce the Justice Department to enforce laws. (It is worth noting that the just-described sweep of the pardon power similarly reflects the Framers\u2019 purposes to divide law-making from law-enforcement and to check potential legislative overreach.)\n\nPre-Obama, prosecutorial discretion was understood as an unremarkable resource-allocation doctrine specific to the criminal law. Enforcement resources are finite. It is neither possible nor desirable to prosecute every single violation of law. Therefore, policymakers, prosecutors, and police must exercise judgment about which violations merit attention and which ones can be overlooked. Mind you, the overlooking does not excuse the law-breaking; it is simply a concession to reality \u2014 there are more pressing threats to society than pot-smoking, petty fraud, etc.\n\nObama, however, has contorted prosecutorial discretion into a license to ignore, \u201cwaive,\u201d rewrite, and otherwise violate congressional statutes \u2014 including laws such as the Affordable Care Act that are far afield from criminal-law enforcement. In sum, \u201cprosecutorial discretion\u201d has become the camouflage for Obama\u2019s usurpation of the powers to write and conclusively interpret the law \u2014 powers the Constitution vests in Congress and the courts.#page#\n\nFaithless Execution outlines a litany of Obama-administration directives that the immigration laws go unenforced. In combination, they already amount to a large-scale amnesty. This, like abuse of the pardon power, can rightly be described as outrageous and condemnable. But, once again, such executive orders are indisputably within the president\u2019s Article II power in the sense that neither Congress nor the courts can compel him to enforce the law.\n\n3. Conferral of Legal StatusUnder the Constitution, the power to determine the qualifications for American citizenship is legislative. Obviously, Congress\u2019s prescriptions must be signed by the president to become law (unless lawmakers have the numbers to override a veto). The president, however, has absolutely no authority to confer legal status or positive benefits (e.g., work permits) on aliens who are in the United States illegally. If the president attempts to do this by executive order \u2014 and, as Faithless Execution recounts, Obama has already done it, albeit on smaller scales than what is now being contemplated \u2014 that would patently exceed his authority, in violation of both the Constitution and statutory law.#ad#\n\nBut it is never that simple, is it? Let\u2019s say Obama pardoned some millions of illegal aliens. The effect of a pardon is to expunge a violation of the law and its attendant effects. In the eyes of the law, it is as if the offense never happened.\n\nWell, the legal and moral case against conferring legal status on illegal aliens is that doing so would excuse their law-breaking, encourage more law-breaking, and give the lawbreakers an unfair preference over aliens who have tried to immigrate lawfully. But a pardon would thrust us into a legal fiction in which we\u2019d have to pretend that the aliens had never broken our immigration laws in the first place. What, then, would remain of the rationale for complaining about the preference given law-breakers over law-abiding aliens? Or for continuing to saddle the aliens with illegal status? Anyone want to bet me on how the nearly 400 judges Obama will have put on the federal bench by 2017 would come out on those questions?\n\nIf the president refuses to enforce the immigration laws and grants something close to a blanket amnesty, we will be on an inexorable course toward citizenship \u2014 and, crucially, voting rights \u2014 for millions of illegal aliens, also known as Democrats waiting to happen. It is the Left\u2019s dream of a permanent, unassimilated, post-American governing majority.\n\nIs that where we are headed?\n\nAbuse of Power and ImpeachmentAs we noted earlier, the president\u2019s pardon power is nearly limitless. There is a single exception, explicit in the Constitution\u2019s Article II, Section 2: \u201cCases of Impeachment.\u201d\n\nThe president can prevent incarceration and other legal punishments for any unlawful acts; but he cannot prevent impeachment \u2014 his own or any other official\u2019s \u2014 based on the abuses of power that flow from those acts. Impeachment is a political remedy, not a legal one. It is about the removal of political power because of breaches of the public trust, not legal prosecution and punishment. Indeed, the Framers considered narrowing the pardon power to prevent the president from granting amnesty for his own lawlessness; they opted against it precisely because they believed the specter of impeachment would be sufficient disincentive.\n\nAs we\u2019ve seen, the president\u2019s pardon and prosecutorial powers are formidable.

In fact, nothing in the Constitution prevents a president from pardoning his own law-breaking. The pardon power does not apply prospectively \u2014 the president may not license future law-breaking. But once the law has been broken, the president can pardon the offense; there is no need for an investigation to have occurred, much less a prosecution or conviction.\n\nPardons, moreover, need neither be individualized nor actually sought by the person to be pardoned. As George Mason law professor James Pfiffner recounts in the Heritage Foundation\u2019s excellent Guide to The Constitution, President Washington granted a blanket amnesty to collaborators in the Whiskey Rebellion; Presidents Lincoln and Johnson pardoned pro-Confederacy seditionists. On his first day in office in 1977, President Carter fulfilled a campaign promise by pardoning hundreds of thousands of Vietnam draft evaders.\u00a0\n\nIt is occasionally claimed that illegal immigration is\u00a0beyond the pardon power\u00a0because it is \u201ccivil\u201d wrong not a criminal offense. This contention is largely incorrect, and it rests on a dubious assumption. Illegal entry into the United States\u00a0is\u00a0a criminal offense, albeit a misdemeanor. Reentry after deportation is a felony. And illegal aliens often\u00a0commit various crimes\u00a0to sustain their unlawful presence in our country. It is certainly true that an alien\u2019s being unlawfully present in the United States \u2014 for example, overstaying a visa or remaining here after illegally entering \u2014 is a civil violation, not a criminal one, but it is serious enough to render an alien deportable. The Constitution, in any event, enables a president to pardon federal \u201cOffenses\u201d \u2014 it does not say\u00a0criminal\u00a0offenses. While it is a reasonable deduction that the Framers\u2019 use of the word \u201coffense\u201d was meant to imply\u00a0crimes, not civil wrongs, why should we assume that federal courts now stacked with Obama-appointed judges would see it that way? Why should the word\u00a0offense\u00a0be any less \u201corganic\u201d than, say, the term equal protection of the laws? Besides, the point of a blanket pardon would not be to confer lawful status on the aliens, something the president has no power to do. The point, as we shall see, would be to pave the way for the courts to finish the job.\n\nThus, fully within his constitutional authority, President Obama could, right this minute and without any congressional approval, pardon every illegal alien in the United States \u2014 indeed, every illegal alien anywhere who has been deported after violating federal law. He could do it by executive order and, while outrageous and condemnable, it would indisputably be within his Article II power. (As I have been pointing out since before Obama\u2019s 2008 election, his longtime friendship with former terrorist Bill Ayers is rooted in their shared radical notions about the American criminal-justice system \u2014 which Ayers, in a book Obama gushingly endorsed, condemned as the racist equivalent of Apartheid South Africa. If I were in Congress right now, I\u2019d be asking the Justice Department a lot of questions about preparations for pardons in Obama\u2019s last two years. If you\u2019re a convict not named Dinesh D\u2019Souza or Nakoula Basseley Nakoula, I imagine you\u2019ve got a shot.)\n\n2. Non-enforcement of the Immigration LawsAs I explain in Faithless Execution, while the Constitution grants much raw power to the president, it also constrains its exercise by placing limits on the legitimate uses of executive authority. A textbook example of illegitimate exercise of a legitimate power is Obama\u2019s abuse of prosecutorial discretion.\n\nProsecution is an awesome executive power. The Framers realized that, throughout history, the joinder in a single official or governing body of the powers to make law and to prosecute was the road to tyranny. So they took pains to separate legislative and prosecutorial authority. The executive branch was given plenary authority over federal law-enforcement: It is entirely up to the president and his Justice Department subordinates to decide what offenses and offenders will be investigated and prosecuted. Congress can try to pressure and prod, but it has no ability to coerce the Justice Department to enforce laws. (It is worth noting that the just-described sweep of the pardon power similarly reflects the Framers\u2019 purposes to divide law-making from law-enforcement and to check potential legislative overreach.)\n\nPre-Obama, prosecutorial discretion was understood as an unremarkable resource-allocation doctrine specific to the criminal law. Enforcement resources are finite. It is neither possible nor desirable to prosecute every single violation of law. Therefore, policymakers, prosecutors, and police must exercise judgment about which violations merit attention and which ones can be overlooked. Mind you, the overlooking does not excuse the law-breaking; it is simply a concession to reality \u2014 there are more pressing threats to society than pot-smoking, petty fraud, etc.\n\nObama, however, has contorted prosecutorial discretion into a license to ignore, \u201cwaive,\u201d rewrite, and otherwise violate congressional statutes \u2014 including laws such as the Affordable Care Act that are far afield from criminal-law enforcement. In sum, \u201cprosecutorial discretion\u201d has become the camouflage for Obama\u2019s usurpation of the powers to write and conclusively interpret the law \u2014 powers the Constitution vests in Congress and the courts.#page#\n\nFaithless Execution outlines a litany of Obama-administration directives that the immigration laws go unenforced. In combination, they already amount to a large-scale amnesty. This, like abuse of the pardon power, can rightly be described as outrageous and condemnable. But, once again, such executive orders are indisputably within the president\u2019s Article II power in the sense that neither Congress nor the courts can compel him to enforce the law.\n\n3. Conferral of Legal StatusUnder the Constitution, the power to determine the qualifications for American citizenship is legislative. Obviously, Congress\u2019s prescriptions must be signed by the president to become law (unless lawmakers have the numbers to override a veto). The president, however, has absolutely no authority to confer legal status or positive benefits (e.g., work permits) on aliens who are in the United States illegally. If the president attempts to do this by executive order \u2014 and, as Faithless Execution recounts, Obama has already done it, albeit on smaller scales than what is now being contemplated \u2014 that would patently exceed his authority, in violation of both the Constitution and statutory law.#ad#\n\nBut it is never that simple, is it? Let\u2019s say Obama pardoned some millions of illegal aliens. The effect of a pardon is to expunge a violation of the law and its attendant effects. In the eyes of the law, it is as if the offense never happened.\n\nWell, the legal and moral case against conferring legal status on illegal aliens is that doing so would excuse their law-breaking, encourage more law-breaking, and give the lawbreakers an unfair preference over aliens who have tried to immigrate lawfully. But a pardon would thrust us into a legal fiction in which we\u2019d have to pretend that the aliens had never broken our immigration laws in the first place. What, then, would remain of the rationale for complaining about the preference given law-breakers over law-abiding aliens? Or for continuing to saddle the aliens with illegal status? Anyone want to bet me on how the nearly 400 judges Obama will have put on the federal bench by 2017 would come out on those questions?\n\nIf the president refuses to enforce the immigration laws and grants something close to a blanket amnesty, we will be on an inexorable course toward citizenship \u2014 and, crucially, voting rights \u2014 for millions of illegal aliens, also known as Democrats waiting to happen. It is the Left\u2019s dream of a permanent, unassimilated, post-American governing majority.\n\nIs that where we are headed?\n\nAbuse of Power and ImpeachmentAs we noted earlier, the president\u2019s pardon power is nearly limitless. There is a single exception, explicit in the Constitution\u2019s Article II, Section 2: \u201cCases of Impeachment.\u201d\n\nThe president can prevent incarceration and other legal punishments for any unlawful acts; but he cannot prevent impeachment \u2014 his own or any other official\u2019s \u2014 based on the abuses of power that flow from those acts. Impeachment is a political remedy, not a legal one. It is about the removal of political power because of breaches of the public trust, not legal prosecution and punishment. Indeed, the Framers considered narrowing the pardon power to prevent the president from granting amnesty for his own lawlessness; they opted against it precisely because they believed the specter of impeachment would be sufficient disincentive.\n\nAs we\u2019ve seen, the president\u2019s pardon and prosecutorial powers are formidable. They do not, however, exist in a vacuum. They exist in a constitutional framework wherein the president\u2019s core duties are to execute the laws faithfully and preserve our system of government. The fact that an act is within a president\u2019s vast lawful power does not make it a faithful, constitutionally legitimate use of that power. As Faithless Execution elaborates, an act need not be criminal or indictable in order to be impeachable. There is far more to fiduciary responsibility than acting within the margins of technical legality.\n\nTo offer an analogy, a judge who sentenced a defendant to 20 years\u2019 imprisonment for handing someone a single marijuana cigarette would be imposing a legal sentence (i.e., within the governing statute) but would demonstrate himself unfit to be a judge. Likewise, lawmakers have the power to impose a 100 percent tax on income, but doing so would be an intolerable abuse of power. Similarly, a president who uses the pardon power and prosecutorial discretion as pretexts for usurping Congress\u2019s power to make immigration law, for encouraging law-breaking, and for remaking the country in a manner that imperils the economic and security interests of American citizens, commits grievous impeachable offenses.\n\nTo be blunt, there is no real power-of-the-purse check on the president\u2019s pardon power. Congress could threaten to withhold funds necessary for other Obama agenda items in an effort to discourage a blanket amnesty \u2014 although it would not be a very credible threat with the soon-to-be Senate majority leader having already pledged to refrain from using Congress\u2019s control of the purse-strings as leverage. But let\u2019s face it: While many of his abuses of power cannot happen without congressional funding, the president doesn\u2019t need a dime to pardon people. He doesn\u2019t even need his phone \u2014 just his pen.\n\nThe only real check on the pardon power is impeachment.\n\nAt this point, would a credible threat of impeachment be much of a check on this president\u2019s designs? I\u2019m not sure. Obama\u2019s stated goal is fundamental transformation of the nation, and a blanket amnesty would accomplish that. From his standpoint, it might be worth the risk. Plus, even if the amnesty suddenly ignited public sentiment for the president\u2019s removal from office (a dubious supposition), nothing in Washington happens quickly. Obama would still have many months if not most of the rest of his term to abuse his awesome powers (including by issuing additional pardons) in transformational ways.\n\nBut I do know this: Absent a credible threat of impeachment, President Obama cannot and will not be stopped from granting amnesty to millions of illegal aliens, who will in short order be awarded citizenship and voting rights. You can call that a plea for impeachment if you\u2019d like. I call it a statement of fact.\n\n\u2014 Andrew C. McCarthy is a policy fellow at the National Review Institute.
