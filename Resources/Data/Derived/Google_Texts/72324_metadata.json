And did Obamacare increase premiums by double digits, as Paul Ryan says?\n\nBy Lauren Carroll, Linda Qiu, and Katie Sanders\n\nThe morning-after analysis of the Democratic debate included plenty of reaction from Donald Trump, the Republican front-runner whose name Democrats invoked several times.\n\nTrump called former secretary of state Hillary Clinton a liar when asked about an unproven claim she made that ISIS is using videos of Trump for recruitment. He also said Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) lied during the debate about Trump\u2019s past comments on Mexicans.\n\nOn ABC\u2019s This Week, George Stephanopoulos asked Trump if he really wanted to go there, given that fact-checkers \u201chave called you out on more false statements than any other candidate.\u201d\n\nTrump really did, inaccurately saying he\u2019s \u201cbeen right on more than anybody else has been right\u201d by far.\n\nStephanopoulos and other moderators moved on to questions about Trump\u2019s embrace of compliments from Russian President Vladimir Putin, criticized for human rights violations against journalists and political opponents. Still, Trump did not back down.\n\nOn NBC\u2019s Meet the Press, Trump defended his characterization of Putin as a strong leader who has made \u201cmincemeat\u201d of President Obama.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s got an 80 percent approval rating done by pollsters from, I understand, this country. OK?\u201d Trump said. \u201cSo it\u2019s not even done by his pollsters. He\u2019s very popular within Russia. That may change.\u201d\n\nIn a first for Donald Trump in 77 fact-checks, this claim about polling rates True.\n\nA November study written by four American researchers backs up Trump\u2019s point, finding about 80 percent of Russians really support Putin.\n\nThe study asked whether Putin\u2019s popularity is real or if respondents have been lying to pollsters. A primary concern for the researchers was the possibility of \u201csocial desirability bias,\u201d the idea that a person who does not support Putin might tell a pollster that they do support him out of fear of retaliation or going against social norms.\n\nTo correct for this, the researchers used a list experiment, a technique used to broach sensitive issues because it does not require respondents to say explicitly that they do or do not support Putin. Pollsters gave Russian respondents a list of several Russian leaders and asked how many they support, but not which ones. By comparing the difference between a control group, which was presented with a list that did not include Putin, with a group that received a list that did include Putin, the researchers were able to estimate overall support for the Russian president.\n\nAfter conducting four list experiments in January and March of this year, researchers concluded that the high level of support for Putin is real. If anything, their finding of 80 percent support might be an underestimate.\n\nHowever, Scott Gehlbach, a co-author of the study and a political science professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, said the study did not account for how many of the 80 percent are devout supporters versus those whose support is fleeting. Further, it\u2019s likely that the Kremlin manipulates public opinion of Putin through tight control of the media.\n\nOne potential wrinkle in Trump\u2019s claim is that while the American researchers designed the study, a Russian polling company, the Levada Center, actually conducted the survey. But Gehlbach said that doesn\u2019t dilute Trump\u2019s claim because the Levada Center is well-regarded as independent from the Russian government.\n\nGet The Beast In Your Inbox!

Ryan, the 2012 vice presidential nominee, called Obama the \u201cmost polarizing president we\u2019ve ever had\u201d and said relations on Capitol Hill would be better if GOP nominee Mitt Romney had won the presidency.\n\nTodd pushed back, saying progressives see the Republican effort to defund Obama\u2019s health care law as a polarizing move.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a law that is not working,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cIt\u2019s a law that\u2019s depriving people\u2019s choices. It\u2019s a law that\u2019s making families pay double-digit premium increases.\u201d\n\nRyan\u2019s statement about premium increases rates Half True.\n\nThe speaker\u2019s office sent us news stories describing how some Obamacare enrollees in some states will see increases of 10 percent or more from this year to next. But hikes in the double digits are not as universal as Ryan suggests and not entirely attributable to the health care law itself.\n\nThe Department of Health and Human Services looked at average rate hikes for the benchmark plan in the marketplace, the second-lowest priced silver plan. According to HHS data, 19 of 37 states in the federal exchange saw an average rate increase in the double digits. At the low end, rates in Missouri increased by 10.4 percent, while Oklahoma saw the biggest hike at 35.7 percent.\n\nConversely, four states saw reduced rates, with Indiana\u2019s decrease in the double digits at 12.6 percent. The other 11 states with rate hikes saw increases below 6.1 percent.\n\nOn average, the benchmark plan has increased 7.5 percent, which decreases once premium tax credits and enrollment figures are factored in.\n\nExperts say hikes are likely the result of insurers underestimating how sick enrollees would be. Larry Levitt of the Kaiser Foundation has stressed that 2016 is the first year that insurers are looking at real claims data. Before, they were \u201cessentially guessing at what their costs were,\u201d he said in October. \u201cSome insurers guessed better than others, which leads to variations in premium changes.\u201d\n\nExperts also stress that premiums vary too much to be captured by averages and can also be unique to an individual\u2019s circumstances.", "article_metadata": {"twitter": {"site": "@thedailybeast", "card": "summary", "creator": "punditfact"}, "keywords": "2016, Paul Ryan, Sunday Talk, This Week, Hillary Clinton, Meet the Press, u.s. poli, Donald Trump", "publicationDate": 201512202157, "wrap": "content/dailybeast/politics", "description": "Does Putin really have an 80 percent approval rating at home according to American researchers, as Trump claims?
