BOULDER — It’s always a successful Bolder Boulder when Dr. Todd Dorfman doesn’t have to do much.

The medical director for the race for the past 12 years, Dorfman delivered a positive report after Monday’s 37th running of the Bolder Boulder.

“Fortunately, we didn’t really have to do anything,” said Dorfman, who works out of Boulder Community Hospital as an emergency physician and associate medical director of trauma services. “In fact, we didn’t even start IVs on anyone in the MASH tent. Usually we’ll start several IVs.”

Cool temperatures always help reduce any heat or dehydration issues, and that proved to be the case Monday.

“Literally, we gave a little bit of oral anti-nausea medication, a bunch of oral rehydration,” he said. “We saw about 26, 28 people and nothing else.”

Several years ago, the team worked to get electricity in as many places on the course as possible. That has allowed them to strategically place 23 defibrillator units on the course — one about every half mile and 11 inside Folsom Field.

The Boston Marathon bombing in 2013 has also changed some procedures to where the medical team practices and prepares for a wide variety of potential situations.

Monday proved to be very uneventful for Dorfman and his team, but it was a nice test run, he said.

“Although it was an easy day, it did give us an opportunity to check our systems,” he said. “The communications systems worked really well.”
