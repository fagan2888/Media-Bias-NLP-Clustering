Pro life leaders were arrested for holding a prayer vigil outside House Speaker Boehner’s office today.

Pro life nurse Jill Stanek, who has been a vociferous critic of President Obama for lying about his history of killing the infant born alive bill when he was in the Illinois State Senate was one of those arrested. Other arrestees include Rev Pat Mahoney, the director of the Christian Defense Coalition and Troy Newman, president of Operation Rescue. Seven pro life protesters were arrested in all.

“We were told yesterday by Speaker Boehner’s office that this is the most pro-life Congress that has ever been installed,” Troy Newman told CNSNEWS.com.

The protesters were holding a vigil in an attempt to get Congress to pass the ban on abortions after 20 weeks. The bill is usually referred to as the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act.

The bill was scheduled to come to a vote in the House on January 22, which is the anniversary of Roe v Wade. It was pulled at the last minute and a bill disallowing the use of federal monies for abortions in circumstances not pertaining to the Affordable Care Act was passed in its place.

I am grateful to these protestors for doing this. Maybe the bad publicity will force Speaker Boehner to bring the bill to a vote.

I’ve personally witnessed pro-life people back down and cover up for Republican leadership when they killed pro life bills here in Oklahoma. I’ve also seen big-name preachers take a pass on everything they’d been preaching to their flocks when leadership leaned on them.

This arrest underscores a simple fact that We the People are loathe to accept: Politics is about power, not morality.
