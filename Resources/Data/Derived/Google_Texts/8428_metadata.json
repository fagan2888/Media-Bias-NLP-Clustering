Mark Udall (Colo.) gave such a painful interview to ABC 7 News in Denver on Friday that he asked for a do-over.\n\nDuring a segment of \u201c10 questions for Mark Udall,\u201d the Democrat was unable to name three books that influenced his life or the last song he listened to, and blamed his lack of an answer on being \u201cbrain-dead.\u201d\n\nWhen asked whether Common Core is good or bad for Colorado\u2019s students, Udall simply said, \u201cYes.\u201d\n\nUdall was able to come up with one book, Profiles in Courage by John F. Kennedy. But after a long pause, he said, \u2018Let me think. We can play this over, right? Let me re-tape this.\u201d\n\nIn attempt to save the Democrat, news anchor Marc Stewart went back to the music question, which Udall had just as difficult a time answering.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the last song you listened to?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m brain-dead today,\u201d Udall said.\n\nUdall was finally able to come up with an answer after a painful pause. \u201cLet me catch my thought here.
