The law prohibits the use of non-public information for private profit, including insider trading by members of Congress and other government employees.\n\nNext month, Schweizer will again go on 60 Minutes, this time with a book titled Extortion (Houghton Mifflin, 2013.)\n\nIn the book, Schweizer argues that the Department of Justice has radically expanded the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) to \u201cshake down\u201d key targets \u2014 while ignoring much more obvious targets on Wall Street.\n\nIn Throw Them All Out, Schweizer called for federal insider trading laws to be applied to members of Congress. Congress acted.\n\nWill Schweizer now call on Congress to pass a domestic version of the FCPA?\n\nWe\u2019re not going to know until next month.\n\nSchweizer\u2019s publicist, Sandy Schulz, said that the book is \u201cunder embargo\u201d because the 60 Minutes has \u201cthe first exclusive interview\u201d with Schweizer and it\u2019s scheduled to run in mid-October.\n\nBut Schweizer went on Breitbart News Sunday (Sirius XM 125) with Stephen Bannon to promote the book and said that \u201ccriminal behavior\u201d was much more of a factor behind \u2014 and at the heart of \u2014 the financial crisis than people making risky choices.\n\nAnd according to early publicity about the book that made it\u2019s way onto the Internet, Schweizer believes extortion is now more of a problem than lobbying.\n\nThe problem used to be that special interests clogged up the system by showering money on politicians, Schweizer says.\n\nNow the dynamic is reversed.\n\nSchweizer argues that money now rules Washington in a whole new way \u2014 by extortion.\n\nOur politicians refuse to schedule votes until corporations and individuals pay up.\n\nThey play one industry off against another for months or years while milking both sides for funds.\n\nThey pass complex bills so that when they leave public service they can hire themselves out as guides to that very complexity.\n\n(Check out the New York Times front page article today on how former Obama officials are are cashing in on Obamacare \u2014 \u201cReaping Profit After Assisting on Health Law,\u201d by Sheryl Gay Stolberg).\n\nThey use leadership PACs to buy loyalty and votes.\n\nSchweizer says \u2014 our leaders no longer care about us.\n\nThey care only about their war chests.\n\nThe book reveals:\n\nHow both political parties maintain a secret dues list, forcing members of Congress to pay to maintain key leadership positions.\n\nHow those key leaders, in turn, use their positions to extort money from donors.\n\nHow leadership PACs are used to underwrite politicians\u2019 lifestyles and purchase each other\u2019s loyalties.\n\nSchweizer says that if Washington adopted some of the ethics laws that govern state politicians, we would be better off.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Corporate Crime Reporter", "description": "In 2011, Peter Schweizer went on 60 Minutes with his book Throw Them All Out: How Politicians and Their Friends Get Rich Off Insider Stock Tips, Land Deals, and Cronyism that Would Send the Rest of Us to Prison (HMH, 2011).
