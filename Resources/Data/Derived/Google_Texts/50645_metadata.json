Kate Brown on Friday signed bipartisan legislation dissolving Cover Oregon, the state's troubled, would-be health insurance exchange. She announced the widely expected decision with little fanfare on Twitter.\n\nSenate Bill 1 was approved by the Legislature on Feb. 27 but didn't officially land at the governor's office until Thursday. Brown, just like she did when signing a class-action damages bill this week, her first as governor, waited about a day to give her blessing once the legislation was on her desk.\n\nCover Oregon's operations will be handed to the Oregon Department of Consumer and Business Services. The agency and the health insurance marketplace it tried to create had already been abandoned amid technical failures, with Oregonians looking to obtain insurance using the federal exchange at HealthCare.gov instead.\n\nA pending U.S. Supreme Court challenge of the Affordable Care Act isn't expected to affect Oregon's insurance customers.\n\n-- Denis C.
