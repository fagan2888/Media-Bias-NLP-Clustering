These children aren\u2019t guaranteed lawyers at their hearings, though some obtain them through nonprofit groups or other means.\n\nThe lawsuit was filed in U.S. District Court in Seattle by the American Civil Liberties Union, the American Immigration Council and other groups on behalf of children facing deportation hearings.\n\n\u201cThe government pays for a trained prosecutor to advocate for the deportation of every child. It is patently unfair to force children to defend themselves alone,\u201d said Ahilan Arulanantham, senior staff attorney with the ACLU\u2019s Immigrants\u2019 Rights Project.\n\nThe suit, J.E.F.M. v. Holder, names as its lead plaintiff a 10-year-old from El Salvador whose father was killed by gang members. He and his family have subsequently been threatened, creating a plausible asylum claim, Mr. Arulanantham said.\n\n\u201cThe question is: should a 10-year-old have to marshal evidence and mount a case?\u201d he said.\n\nThe suit isn\u2019t directly tied to the surge of unaccompanied minors arriving at the southwest border but, if successful, could have a significant impact on government efforts to deal with that crisis.\n\nAlso Wednesday, the Justice Department said it would take several steps to deal with the surge in border crossings by minors and families, including prioritizing cases involving migrants who have recently crossed the southwest border and have been placed into deportation proceedings.\n\nThe Justice Department said its Executive Office for Immigration Review would hire more immigration judges, including temporary ones, and expand access to legal resources and assistance for people in removal proceedings.\n\nContinue reading at WSJ.com.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "Civil-rights groups on Wednesday filed a class-action lawsuit that faults the U.S. government for not providing legal representation to children facing deportation hearings, the latest wrinkle for the Obama administration as it scrambles resources to meet a surge of unaccompanied minors arriving at the nation's southwest border.", "title": "Groups Sue U.S. Over Lack of Legal Aid for Minors Facing Deportation", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/law/2014/07/09/groups-sue-u-s-over-lack-of-legal-aid-to-minors-facing-deportation/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/img/WSJ_profile_lg.gif"}, "site": "WSJ", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Business", "article.headline": "Groups Sue U.S. Over Lack of Legal Aid for Minors Facing Deportation", "description": "Civil-rights groups on Wednesday filed a class-action lawsuit that faults the U.S. government for not providing legal representation to children facing deportation hearings, the latest wrinkle for the Obama administration as it scrambles resources to meet a surge of unaccompanied minors arriving at the nation's southwest border.", "article_section": "Business", "author": "Jeffrey Sparshott", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "testkeys": "C", "article.page": "Law Blog Blog", "page.subsection": "Law Blog", "article.summary": "Civil-rights groups on Wednesday filed a class-action lawsuit that faults the U.S. government for not providing legal representation to children facing deportation hearings, the latest wrinkle for the Obama administration as it scrambles resources to meet a surge of unaccompanied minors arriving at the nation's southwest border.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "page.content.format": "responsive", "article.published": "2014-07-09T18:49:46-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-159", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/law/2014/07/09/groups-sue-u-s-over-lack-of-legal-aid-to-minors-facing-deportation/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-LB-48553", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Business", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "Civil-rights groups on Wednesday filed a class-action lawsuit that faults the U.S. government for not providing legal representation to children facing deportation hearings, the latest wrinkle for the Obama administration as it scrambles resources to meet a surge of unaccompanied minors arriving at the nation's southwest border.", "title": "Groups Sue U.S. Over Lack of Legal Aid for Minors Facing Deportation", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/law/2014/07/09/groups-sue-u-s-over-lack-of-legal-aid-to-minors-facing-deportation/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/blogs/img/WSJ_Logo_BlackBackground_1200x630social", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Law Blog", "article.id": "BL-LB-48553", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2014-07-09T18:54:35-04:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd11db\"", "article_summary": "The suit seeks to require agencies to provide children with legal representation at deportation hearings.\nThe lawsuit was filed in U.S. District Court in Seattle by the American Civil Liberties Union, the American Immigration Council and other groups on behalf of children facing deportation hearings.\nThese children aren\u2019t guaranteed lawyers at their hearings, though some obtain them through nonprofit groups or other means.\n\u201cThe government pays for a trained prosecutor to advocate for the deportation of every child.\nv.
