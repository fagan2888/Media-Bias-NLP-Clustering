That's an exciting place to be. It's also a big responsibility.\n\nThe substantial number of delegates at stake in Tuesday's primary \u2014 95 Republican, 291 Democratic \u2014 could help solidify a front-runner's lead, or give fresh momentum and greater credibility to a lagging challenger. So for New York, this primary is serious business, as potentially significant as those early contests in Iowa and New Hampshire tend to be.\n\nIt's largely for that reason that we are endorsing in the presidential primary this year, something we don't routinely do. And as we considered those endorsements, foremost in our minds was not simply whose positions and values we agree with, but who seems most capable of being president, even if we may disagree with them on certain issues.\n\nThat's something we hope New Yorkers consider when they go to the polls on Tuesday, as well: not just who says what they want to hear, but who they believe can fill what is arguably the most important and consequential job in the world.\n\nBoth candidates promote progressive agendas, but who can make it happen?\n\nFor all the frequent consensus between former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, they differ significantly on details, their approach to governing, and their experience. It's those differences that give Mrs. Clinton the decisive edge in the Democratic primary.\n\nThere is no question that Mr. Sanders has a long, consistent record of progressivism. The centerpieces of his campaign are a single-payer national health care system, free college education for all, breaking up big banks, higher taxes on Wall Street and the rich, and reining in the power of money in politics.\n\nBeyond the cost of Mr. Sanders' ideas \u2014 which would add an estimated $15.3 trillion in spending over the next decade \u2014 are his prospects for achieving them. We've witnessed how Republicans in Congress have spent seven years trying to thwart President Barack Obama's more modest agenda. And first he has to get elected. Mr. Sanders' democratic socialist ideology will make him hard to sell \u2014 and easy to misrepresent and attack \u2014 in the general election.\n\nMrs. Clinton takes a more moderate, centrist approach while still espousing progressive values. Her plans take considerably less money \u2014 about $1.1 trillion over the next decade, raised mainly through higher taxes on the rich. She favors building on Obamacare, which has insured some 20 million more Americans so far. She prefers to target more college aid to those who need it. Like Mr. Sanders, she promotes more income equality, and a constitutional amendment that would allow more limits on campaign finance to reduce the influence of big money in politics.\n\nAs for the attacks she is likely to endure from Republicans, she's been weathering them for years, while the GOP hasn't even gotten started with Mr. Sanders. And her time as a U.S. senator from New York demonstrated she has the ability to work across the aisle.\n\nBut she'll need to first use those skills, should she win the nomination, to persuade Mr. Sanders' supporters that she deserves the tremendous enthusiasm they have for him. To do that, she'll need to apply her pragmatic approach to more of his forward-thinking ideas.\n\nIn a wild year for Republicans, the Ohio governor is the grown-up in the room\n\nThe Republican presidential primary has been quite a show. A field that started with 17 hopefuls is down to three, including, fortunately, the most solid candidate in the pack: Ohio Gov. John Kasich.\n\nGovernor Kasich has consistently been the grown-up in the room, taking sober, thoughtful positions while other candidates seemed intent on demonstrating how combative, hawkish, and anti-government they could be, and how far to the extreme right they could go without going completely over the edge.\n\nWhile we disagree with his positions on issues like abortion rights, we see in Governor Kasich a candidate who strives to adhere to his values without being divisive. He's the only one of the three with executive experience in government, and on his watch Ohio's shaky finances have stabilized and the state has seen modest job growth. Though he opposes Obamacare, he was practical enough to take advantage of the program's expansion of Medicaid for the benefit of his constituents' health.\n\nAs for the other candidates, Donald Trump has built a vulgar, divisive campaign on denigrating Mexicans and Muslims, a wasteful border wall, destructive trade wars, letting more countries have nuclear weapons, punishing women for getting abortions (a position he was forced to walk back), and simplistic, populist solutions that economists say would explode today's $19 trillion debt to as much as $39 trillion.\n\nSen. Ted Cruz of Texas is hardly a better choice. He is disliked by many colleagues in Congress, and offers absurd ideas \u2014 eliminating the IRS, reducing tax forms to postcards, and carpet bombing terrorists in civilian areas and leaving. He blithely rejects the scientific consensus on climate change, and scorns America's vital wall between church and state.\n\nNeither Mr. Trump nor Mr. Cruz is suited to be president, and either would likely lead the party to a crushing defeat this fall. The one hope for Republicans is to deny Mr. Trump the majority of delegates he needs, opening the way for a contested convention at which a more credible, sensible and broadly appealing candidate can emerge. In casting a ballot for Governor Kasich on Tuesday, New York Republicans could lead the party back from the brink.", "article_metadata": {"SKYPE_TOOLBAR": "SKYPE_TOOLBAR_PARSER_COMPATIBLE", "description": "The substantial number of delegates at stake in Tuesday's primary \u2014 95 Republican, 291 Democratic \u2014 could help solidify a front-runner's lead, or give fresh momentum and greater credibility to a lagging challenger.
