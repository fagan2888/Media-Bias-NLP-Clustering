A search of McDaniels cell phone revealed evidence of the relationship.\n\nDuring his first appearance Friday morning, Honorable Wade Mercer of the 14th Judicial Circuit had this to say:\n\n\"In the complaint, the warrant is for one count, but the complaint does allege several instances of second degree felonies and possibly some third degree felonies after the young lady turns 16. And as I understand, according to the State Attorney's office... you made, I don't know if 'confession' is the right word, but incriminating statements.\"\n\nThe victim, now a student of Sneads High School, was once a student of McDaniels at Grand Ridge Middle School.\n\nMcDaniel is the son of Jackson County Deputy Superintendent, Cheryl McDaniel and Panhandle Area Educational Consortium's (PAEC) Executive Director, Patrick McDaniel.\n\n\"It's a sad situation on both sides of the investigation,\" Jackson County Major, Donnie Branch said.\n\nAccording the Branch, the case was still under investigation.\n\nMcDaniel's bond was set for $75,000. He accepted a conditional release agreement to pay 10% of the bond to the Registry of the Courts and have no contact with the victim or her family.\n\nJudge Mercer said, \"no contact means no contact. I understand this is a young lady and she may initiate contact. If she does, you tell her, i cannot talk to you or i will go back to jail. If I get any reliable information that you have texted her, you have called her, you have Facebooked her, you met her at Walmart- then you will go to jail with no bond and you will stay there.\"\n\nThe McDaniel family and school officials declined to comment.", "article_metadata": {"medium": "video", "description": "A Jackson County teacher was charged with lewd and lascivious battery for having an alleged sexual relationship with a 15 year old girl.
