And he knows how to bluff.\"\n\nAs the leader of United Civil Front and chairman of the Human Rights Foundation, Kasparov also worries that business and political leaders in what used to be called \u201cthe Free World\u201d are no longer interested in backing large, transformative projects similar to landing a man on the Moon and the creation of the Internet. \u201cIt is very important that we have these projects to energize society,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd also that we don\u2019t eliminate risk. Because it seems to me that now we teach kids from school that failure is nothing but failure. If you fail, you are a failure. No, no, I believe that failure is a logical move on the way to success.\u201d\n\nAfter becoming the youngest World Chess Champion in 1985, Kasparov went on to a career that is among the greatest in the sport. Originally supportive of Gorbachev\u2019s reform, when the Soviet Union collapsed, Kasparov became increasingly outspoken against the failures of Russian leadership, especially under Putin.\n\nReason\u2019s Nick Gillespie interviewed Kasparov in New York in November at a dinner co-hosted by the Atlas Network, a nonprofit that promotes free-market think tanks in the developing world.\n\nAbout 30 minutes.\n\nCamera by Meredith Bragg and Jim Epstein.

November 9, 1985, I won my world championship title in Moscow.\n\nReason TV: We'd like to think that the two events are not unlinked. Talk a little bit about what the enduring lessons of the fight against communism, that we are in 25 years it seems a couple of worlds ago. What are the lessons that we're in the danger in losing from long after the twilight of the cold war.\n\nKasparov: I think we've forgotten many important lessons of the Cold war. I have to say that when I entered this field in the mid 80's as the newly born world champion, it was not as dangers. So Gorbachev badly needed to reconcile with the west. The soviet economy was in terrible shape. Oil prices were sharply falling thanks to the cooperation between Reagan's administration and the Saudis. And it was absolutely clear even for the soviet politburo that the arms race in the competition against the United States on the global scale was no longer a plausible option.\n\nSo Gorbachev tried hard and he made several attempts to convince Ronald Reagan to accept some sort of peace accord. Thanks to Reagan's intuition and despite the advice of all his advisors, his administration, the state department, the pentagon, he said no in Reykjavik. And I think by saying no in Reykjavik, Reagan made Perestroika and the eventual collapse of the Soviet Union inevitable in such a short period of time.\n\nReason TV: And of course Reykjavik...\n\nKasparov: A symbolic place. 1972, Bobby Fisher beat Boris Spassky. That was another episode of the big victory of the free world in the cold war.\n\nReason TV: And thereby condemning all of us in grammar school in the 70's to joining chess clubs. What was it like to grow up in the Soviet system? You were in the relatively privileged position.\n\nKasparov: I was relatively privileged, because of my chess.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "\u201cI think we've forgotten many important lessons of the Cold war,\u201d says human-rights activist and former World Chess Champion&nbsp;Garry Kasparov.", "title": "Garry Kasparov on Chess, the Cold War, and the West's Shameful Appeasement of Putin", "url": "http://reason.com/reasontv/2014/12/08/chess-champion-garry-kasparov-slams-puti", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/media/js/tiny_mce/plugins/pagebreak/img/trans.gif", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "\u201cI think we've forgotten many important lessons of the Cold\nwar,\u201d says human-rights activist and former World Chess\nChampion&nbsp;Garry\nKasparov.
