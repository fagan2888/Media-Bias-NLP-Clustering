Puckett, shown in 2010, resigned from the Virginia Senate, flipping control of the chamber to Republicans and thwarting Gov. Terry McAuliffe\u2019s signature goal of expanding health coverage under the Affordable Care Act. (Steve Helber/AP)\n\nVirginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe\u2019s top lieutenant apologized Friday after admitting that he had tried to keep a Democrat from quitting the evenly divided state Senate with the prospect of a lucrative state job for the senator\u2019s daughter.\n\nBut it was not entirely clear to Richmond\u2019s increasingly bewildered and antsy political class just what Chief of Staff Paul Reagan had done.\n\nHad he engaged in a crass and potentially illegal bidding war with Republicans who, in the middle of a standoff over the state budget and Medicaid expansion, wanted Democrat Phillip P. Puckett out of the Senate as desperately as McAuliffe\u2019s administration wanted him in?\n\nOr had Reagan merely committed politics as usual with one decidedly inconvenient twist: a voice-mail message that eventually put his sausage-making on public display?\n\nThe shifting and sometimes contradictory explanations that flowed from McAuliffe\u2019s office only added to the sense of disorientation in a state capital still recovering from the shock of seeing popular former governor Robert F. McDonnell (R) and his wife, Maureen, convicted of corruption in August. First, McAuliffe\u2019s spokesman said that the governor had been unaware of Reagan\u2019s actions before Thursday but defended the chief of staff when asked what the governor thought of the voicemail. On Friday, McAuliffe (D) said Reagan had made a mistake.\n\nPaul Reagan, Va. Gov. Terry McAuliffe\u2019s chief of staff, left a voice mail for Phillip P. Puckett in the frenzied days leading up to the senator\u2019s resignation in June. (Steve Helber/AP)\n\nRichmond, a place with scant history of political scandal, faced the specter of another federal investigation winding its way into a governor\u2019s office.\n\nSince June, federal officials have been probing Puckett\u2019s abrupt resignation, looking at whether Republicans used job offers for him and his daughter to lure him out of the Senate. Now, political observers wonder if the inquiry will have to expand to the potential job that Reagan dangled to try to make him stay.\n\n\u201cIt appears now that the ethics commission in Virginia consists of the U.S. attorney for the Western District and the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District,\u201d said Bob Gibson, executive director of the Sorensen Institute for Political Leadership at the University of Virginia, referring to the offices behind the Puckett and McDonnell investigations, respectively. \u201cAnd that\u2019s really sad.\u201d\n\nSome of McAuliffe\u2019s harshest critics expressed wariness about the prospect that the investigation could expand, even as they contended that anything known about what Republicans offered Puckett paled next to the blunt link described in Reagan\u2019s voice mail.\n\n\u201cThis is the danger of criminalizing ordinary politics,\u201d said Sen. Richard H. Black (R-Loudoun). \u201cWhen you do that, it can come back to bite you. . . . If [the U.S. attorney] is going to investigate Republicans for job discussions, he can\u2019t possibly ignore job offers by Democrats.\u201d\n\nOfficials with the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Western District of Virginia, which convened a grand jury to investigate Puckett\u2019s resignation, did not respond to messages seeking comment.\n\nMcAuliffe spokesman Brian Coy declined to say whether prosecutors had interviewed anyone in the office or subpoenaed any records. He also declined to explain why he initially declared forcefully \u2014 and erroneously \u2014 that no one on the staff had spoken to Puckett about a job. Coy refused to say whether he had made a mistake when he claimed to have spoken to everyone in the office \u2014 or whether Reagan had failed to reveal his message to Puckett.\n\nThe first account of Reagan\u2019s actions came late Thursday, when The Washington Post reported that the longtime Virginia political hand had floated the idea of providing a top state job to Puckett\u2019s daughter if the senator stayed in his seat. Reagan conveyed the suggestion in a voice mail that was described to The Post by three people who had heard it.\n\nIt had been known publicly since June that Puckett had been talking about a job for himself and a judgeship for his daughter when he abruptly stepped down that month. Puckett said at the time that there was no quid pro quo.\n\nNews of Reagan\u2019s voice mail was the first indication that anyone working for McAuliffe \u2014 who as recently as last week called Puckett \u201cdespicable\u201d for seeming to trade potential job offers for his seat \u2014 had offered a potential job as an enticement to stay.\n\nReagan mentioned the possibility of heading a state agency, including the Department of Mines, Minerals and Energy, a prestigious slot in the coal country of far southwestern Virginia where the Pucketts live.\n\n\u201cWe would be very eager to accommodate her, if, if that would be helpful in keeping you in the Senate,\u201d Reagan said in the message, according to a transcript provided to The Post and not disputed by McAuliffe\u2019s office. \u201cWe, we would basically do anything.\u201d\n\nOn Thursday, Coy said Reagan had made the offer because the Senate Republicans\u2019 anti-\n\nnepotism policy was holding Martha Puckett Ketron\u2019s judicial appointment \u201chostage.\u201d She had been serving temporarily as juvenile judge but could not win a full appointment to the bench while her father was in the Senate.\n\nAlso Thursday, Coy said that McAuliffe was unaware of Reagan\u2019s offer but was not displeased with his actions, saying, \u201cThe governor has full confidence in Paul Reagan.\u201d\n\nOn Friday, Reagan issued a statement that gave a different rationale: advancing McAuliffe\u2019s signature goal of expanding Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, an effort that collapsed when Puckett eventually resigned, throwing control of the Senate to Republicans. He also apologized for letting his boss, the governor, down.\n\n\u201cIn the fight to expand health care to uninsured Virginians, I was overzealous and acted with poor judgment,\u201d Reagan said in the statement. \u201cI certainly regret this and will always try to achieve the high standards demanded by Governor McAuliffe.\u201d\n\nAnd McAuliffe himself, who the night before had defended Reagan through a spokesman, pronounced himself \u201cdisappointed.\u201d\n\n\u201cPaul acted hastily and made an error in judgment \u2014 he acknowledges that and recognizes that it was inconsistent with the way I run my administration,\u201d McAuliffe said in a written statement. \u201cI was disappointed that this occurred and have made it clear to every member of my staff that this is not how we do business. This is a lesson to my staff \u2014 people make mistakes \u2014 but it\u2019s important that we learn from them and move on.\u201d\n\nReaction elsewhere in Richmond to the news was muted, with Democrats defending Reagan and Republicans pointing out what they see as Democrats\u2019 hypocrisy for criticizing Puckett and the GOP even though Reagan made a similar gesture.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m obviously disturbed about the report that you all had in the paper this morning,\u201d said House Speaker William J. Howell (R-Stafford) on a conference call with reporters on another topic. \u201cLet\u2019s see what happens with it. The thing that\u2019s most troubling about it is the governor\u2019s reaction to what all happened with Senator Puckett. He used some pretty strong language about what happened with Senator Puckett, and then to have this come forward a few days later is pretty surprising.\u201d\n\nBefore Reagan issued his apology, two top Democrats in the state Senate said they saw nothing wrong with his behavior.\n\nSen. A. Donald McEachin (D-Henrico) echoed Democrats\u2019 position that Reagan\u2019s voice-mail for Puckett does not rise to the level of the accusations against Republicans.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s completely different from what certain Republicans are alleged to have done. It appears from the transcript I have seen that Paul Reagan was just trying to talk to Senator Puckett in a fashion to preserve the status quo,\u201d McEachin said. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t seeking to have Senator Puckett do anything. He was just saying that his daughter might have other options. On the other hand, what the Republicans are accused of is not preserving the status quo but allegedly offering Senator Puckett a job for himself and a judgeship for his daughter. That is wholly different.\u201d\n\nSenate Majority Leader Richard L. Saslaw (D-Fairfax) called Reagan\u2019s offer \u201cnothing out of the ordinary\u201d and recalled then-governor James S. Gilmore III\u2019s 1997 hire of a Democratic senator from Loudoun County, Charles Waddell, as his deputy transportation secretary, giving Republicans a one-seat advantage in the upper chamber.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think this hinges so much on whether you were offered the job but how it was done,\u201d Saslaw said.\n\nAlthough he reserved judgment on whether Puckett did anything wrong in appearing to resign in exchange for a job at the tobacco commission, Saslaw said Reagan\u2019s action was different because he \u201cwasn\u2019t fattening Puckett\u2019s wallet, it was offering his daughter a job.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Chief of staff Paul Reagan left a voice mail for Phillip Puckett about a job for Puckett\u2019s daughter.", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/laura.vozzella", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Chief of staff Paul Reagan left a voice mail for Phillip Puckett about a job for Puckett\u2019s daughter.", "title": "McAuliffe aide apologizes for \u2018overzealous\u2019 suggestion of job for senator\u2019s daughter if he stayed in his seat", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/virginia-politics/mcauliffe-aide-apologizes-for-overzealous-suggestion-of-job-for-senators-daughter/2014/10/03/088d82e8-4b0f-11e4-891d-713f052086a0_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2014/10/02/Local-Politics/Images/AP100208011583.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@jennaportnoy"}, "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "VA POLITICS, Virginia politics, phil puckett, paul reagan, terry mcauliffe, virginia ethics, virginia tobacco commission", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/laura.vozzella"}, "eomportal-uuid": "088d82e8-4b0f-11e4-891d-713f052086a0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "VA POLITICS, Virginia politics, phil puckett, paul reagan, terry mcauliffe, virginia ethics, virginia tobacco commission"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1493\"", "article_summary": "The thing that\u2019s most troubling about it is the governor\u2019s reaction to what all happened with Senator Puckett.\nTerry McAuliffe\u2019s top lieutenant apologized Friday after admitting that he had tried to keep a Democrat from quitting the evenly divided state Senate with the prospect of a lucrative state job for the senator\u2019s daughter.\nPhilip P.
