But those folks who support the legislation overall and the Medicaid expansion in particular can't always point to a particular person who died because a state rejected that expansion.\n\nBut Adam O'Neal, the mayor of Belhaven, N.C., told the Washington Post that he can. Portia Gibbs, a 48-year-old woman his town, died, O'Neal said, because she had a heart attack after the town's hospital closed and emergency transportation didn't arrive in time. \"She spent the last hour of her life in a parking lot at a high school waiting for a helicopter,\" O'Neal told columnist Dana Milbank.\n\nGibbs actually had health insurance, but because of her state's Medicaid rejection, her closest hospital closed.\n\nAs Milbank explains it, the new health care law cuts subsidies to hospitals that treat the uninsured. Those cuts were supposed to be counteracted by an increase in people getting Medicaid. But North Carolina was one of half the states that rejected Medicaid expansion.\n\nMilbank says O'Neal's anger is notable because it's being expressed by a white, Southern Republican. \"I'm a pretty conservative guy,\" O'Neal said, \"but this is a matter of people dying.\"\n\nExactly. I think far too many of us have lost sight of the human consequences to health care policy decisions. O'Neal, who walked 273 miles to Washington to protest said the members of his own party in North Carolina are \"allowing people to die to prove a point.\" You can read Milbank's full column here: North Carolina Republicans put ideology above lives.\n\nI don't disagree with the mayor of Belhaven being upset, nor with his public protest, but perhaps instead of marching to Washington, he should have marched to Raleigh instead.\n\nJarvis DeBerry can be reached at jdeberry@nola.com.
