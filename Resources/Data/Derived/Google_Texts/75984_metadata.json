News channel 6\u2019s Renetta DuBose is always investigating. She spoke with one employee who told her she found out she was not covered in the middle of medical treatments.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m in pain constantly. I have no more medicine. And I still constantly have to drag myself to work. I barely can walk,\u201d Sheila Rozier said.\n\nIt seems like an open and shut case. You work full time and health insurance will be given to you, provided you pay a premium. Sheila Rozier does just that where she works.\n\n\u201c[I pay] $45 per pay period,\u201d she explained.\n\nRozier said she had a pinched nerve in her right shoulder. Now, her entire right arm is numb and she\u2019s unable to use it. She went to a neurologist, but her Blue Cross Blue Shield didn\u2019t work.\n\n\u201cI was already going to one specialist, but he transferred me to another specialist. When I went to the second specialist that\u2019s when I found out we didn\u2019t have any insurance and that was around the middle or end of May,\u201d she told DuBose.\n\nRozier is a Certified Nursing Assistant for Amara Healthcare and Rehabilitation, a nursing home off Peach Orchard Road in Augusta. She tells DuBose she contacted her employer June 1 about not having health insurance and they told her it collapsed six months ago.\n\n\u201cI never got a letter from Blue Cross Blue Shield saying we didn\u2019t have no insurance. It\u2019s just like a blind spot,\u201d she described.\n\nThe National Provider Identifier Database list Douglas Mittleider as President of Amara, which also operates as Salem Nursing and Rehab Center of Augusta.\n\nA call to Mittleider at Altacare Corporation in Alpharetta, Georgia went unanswered, so we left a message.\n\nAfter learning about claims that health insurance was unexpectedly dropped for people who work for Amara, we also uncovered that the owner has been the subject of a federal lawsuit.\n\nWe got our hands on the previous Director of Nursing\u2019s resignation letter. In that letter she states some employees worry about having insurance coverage because some have not had it at times. She also states she has \u2018read copies of insurance cancellations as of September 1, 2014 where employees lost their coverage, but continued to pay their insurance premiums.\u2019 Her letter also stated that Amara employees were covered at that point, but wonder for how long.\n\nRozier wonders too, especially since the Affordable Care Act denied her request.\n\n\u201cThey tell me I cannot get enrolled until November because it\u2019s not enrollment time and if I do they want to charge you a $189 fee to get in. Then, they\u2019re not going to pay for this ongoing problem I already have. I have to wait a year before I go to the doctor to see about this so, I\u2019m still stuck,\u201d she said.\n\nRozier added she is unable to work with patients without the help of her co-workers. She\u2019s required to lift them and roll them over and that task has been tough.\n\nMittleider has not returned DuBose\u2019s call as of Wednesday, June 24, 2015 at 6:00 p.m.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Amara Healthcare and Rehab employees claim nursing home dropped them from health insurance despite premiums being paid.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=397295844", "og": {"site_name": "WJBF-TV", "description": "Some employees of a local nursing home claim they have been dropped from their health insurance after paying for it.
