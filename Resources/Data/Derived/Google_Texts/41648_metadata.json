So it\u2019s fitting Lovato is now the face of the \"Be Vocal: Speak Up For Mental Health\" campaign.\n\n\"Be Vocal\" was launched by Sunovion Pharmaceuticals, as well as the Depression and Bipolar Support Alliance, JED, Mental Health America, the National Alliance on Mental Illness, and the National Council for Behavioral Health. The campaign aims to encourage people across America to use their voice to support and lessen the stigma attached to mental health care. Of the many things Lovato has learned is she\u2019s not alone: An estimated 44 million adults are diagnosed with a mental health condition each year.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not something that anyone should be ashamed of,\u201d Lovato said. \u201cThe more people talk about it, the more people can come out and get the help they need.\u201d\n\nJust last year Lovato urged congress to pass a mental health care bill. She, like many advocates, believes it\u2019s time for there to be a comprehensive bill that gets across how much mental health matters. A recent report from the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) concluded there\u2019s still a long road ahead before mental health care and medical care achieve true parity. It\u2019s one of the many things Lovato hopes to help achieve with this campaign.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "demi, lovato, new, face, be, vocal, mental, health, campaign, hoping, lessen, stigma", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Demi Lovato furthers her mental health advocacy by partnering with \"Be Vocal,\" an initiative encouraging individuals to speak up for both themselves and their community.", "title": "Demi Lovato Wants You To 'Be Vocal' About Mental Health [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/demi-lovato-new-face-be-vocal-mental-health-campaign-hoping-lessen-stigma-335514", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured_video/public/2015/05/28/demi-lovato-new-face-be-vocal-mental-health-campain-hoping-lessen-stigma.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Demi Lovato furthers her mental health advocacy by partnering with \"Be Vocal,\" an initiative encouraging individuals to speak up for both themselves and their community.", "title": "Demi Lovato Wants You To 'Be Vocal' About Mental Health [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/demi-lovato-new-face-be-vocal-mental-health-campaign-hoping-lessen-stigma-335514", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured_video/public/2015/05/28/demi-lovato-new-face-be-vocal-mental-health-campain-hoping-lessen-stigma.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/05/28/demi-lovato-new-face-be-vocal-mental-health-campain-hoping-lessen-stigma.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2015-05-28T17:13:57-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-05-28T17:13:56-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Demi Lovato furthers her mental health advocacy by partnering with \"Be Vocal,\" an initiative encouraging individuals to speak up for both themselves and their community."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc8f5\"", "article_summary": "So it\u2019s fitting Lovato is now the face of the \"Be Vocal: Speak Up For Mental Health\" campaign.\nThe campaign aims to encourage people across America to use their voice to support and lessen the stigma attached to mental health care.\nSince being diagnosed with bipolar disorder, singer-actress Demi Lovato has been vocal about her journey, as well as the importance of mental health care.\n\"Be Vocal\" was launched by Sunovion Pharmaceuticals, as well as the Depression and Bipolar Support Alliance, JED, Mental Health America, the National Alliance on Mental Illness, and the National Council for Behavioral Health.\nShe, like many advocates, believes it\u2019s time for there to be a comprehensive bill that gets across how much mental health matters."}
