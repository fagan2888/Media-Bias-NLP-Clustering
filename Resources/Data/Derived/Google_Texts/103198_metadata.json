I just can\u2019t stand that he\u2019s black.\u2019 <\u2014 What Obama thinks white people think,\u201d another tweet read.\n\nObama also noted in the interview that his main priority is looking forward and trying to address the nation\u2019s concern about jobs and the economy.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Atlanta Black Star", "description": "President Obama spoke bluntly yesterday about how he thinks his race has affected his approval ratings, saying during an interview with The New Yorker that there are many Americans who may not ever approve of him simply because he is Black.
