A major discovery was announced on Wednesday by NASA: Water vapor and clear skies were discovered on a Neptune-sized exoplanet outside of our solar system — 124 lightyears away.

Using data from Hubble, Kepler and Spitzer telescopes, astronauts discovered the gaseous planet, HAT-P-11b. Through clear skies, they were able to view steamy water vapor molecules. The results were published today in the journal Nature.

The discovery of water vapor may immediately trigger giddy feelings — water is one of the building blocks of life, as we know it. However, the clear skies are just as exciting. Usually thick atmospheres prevent more in-depth study of Neptune-sized exoplanets.

“When astronomers go observing at night with telescopes, they say ‘clear skies’ to mean good luck,” explained co-author Jonathan Fraine, who is from the University of Maryland. “In this case, we found clear skies on a distant planet. That’s lucky for us because it means clouds didn’t block our view of water molecules.”
