They're more than two times as likely to die as babies born to white mothers.\n\nWhite infants in our city don't do a lot better, when you compare their odds of survival against kids born in the rest of Ohio, the nation, or other developed countries. They're as likely to survive to a first birthday as kids born in Cyprus or Ukraine.\n\nInfant mortality rates are measured by the number of babies who die before their first birthday, per thousand live births. Cleveland's rate is about 13, one of the worst in the country. Ohio's infant mortality rate is 7.4, ranking us 45th in the nation.\n\nWhy do pregnant women and new babies fare poorly in our region and state? Here, we're looking into the complicated causes of infant deaths, and how we can do better. We'll talk about what works, in Cleveland and in other cities that have already tackled the problem. | Read Brie Zeltner's story\n\nSecret grand jury in Tamir Rice case hasn't been so secret\n\n", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Cleveland, Parma, mortality rate, Tamir Rice, Ohio, Cuyahoga County, consent-decree, frank-jackson, healthcare, infant-mortality, obamacare, parma-payroll, saving-the-smallest, tamir-rice, top-five-at-five, news", "title": "Saving the Smallest; not-so-secret Tamir Rice grand jury; Parma salaries rise as services cut: Top 5 at 5", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Saving the Smallest; not-so-secret Tamir Rice grand jury; Parma salaries rise as services cut: Top 5 at 5\", \"link\": \"http://www.cleveland.com/top-5/2015/12/saving_the_smallest_not-so-sec.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://image.cleveland.com/home/cleve-media/width620/img/health_impact/photo/19327007-standard.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"17615706\", \"pub_date\": \"2015-12-10T22:00:13Z\", \"author\": \"Ray Jablonski, cleveland.com\", \"tags\": [\"consent-decree\",\"frank-jackson\",\"healthcare\",\"infant-mortality\",\"obamacare\",\"parma-payroll\",\"saving-the-smallest\",\"tamir-rice\",\"top-five-at-five\"] }", "twitter": {"image": "http://image.cleveland.com/home/cleve-media/width620/img/health_impact/photo/19327007-standard.jpg", "description": "A summary of some of today's top stories on cleveland.com.", "site": "@clevelanddotcom", "card": "summary", "title": "Saving the Smallest; not-so-secret Tamir Rice grand jury; Parma salaries rise as services cut: Top 5 at 5"}, "article_date_updated": "Thursday, December 10, 2015,  5:38 PM", "parsely-metadata": "{\"short_title\": \"Saving the Smallest; not-so-secret Tamir Rice grand jury: Top 5 at 5\", \"image_url\": \"http://media.cleveland.com/health_impact/photo/baby-caution-x1jpg-4f5d4ba630f471dc.jpg\", \"author_name\": \"rfjablon\", \"author_nickname\": \"Ray Jablonski, cleveland.com\", \"author_id\": \"1771\", \"source_blog_name\": \"Top 5 at 5\", \"source_blog_url\": \"http://www.cleveland.com/top-5/\", \"sponsored_content\": \"0\" }", "og": {"site_name": "cleveland.com", "description": "A summary of some of today's top stories on cleveland.com.", "title": "Saving the Smallest; not-so-secret Tamir Rice grand jury; Parma salaries rise as services cut: Top 5 at 5", "url": "http://www.cleveland.com/top-5/2015/12/saving_the_smallest_not-so-sec.html", "image": "http://image.cleveland.com/home/cleve-media/width620/img/health_impact/photo/19327007-standard.jpg", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "cleveland.com", "article": {"author": "http://https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100010038038232"}, "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Thursday, December 10, 2015,  5:00 PM", "article_author": "Ray Jablonski, cleveland.com", "Description": "A summary of some of today's top stories on cleveland.com."}, "article_summary": "Black babies born here are as likely to survive their first year as babies born in Syria or Jordan.\nOhio's infant mortality rate is 7.4, ranking us 45th in the nation.\nInfant mortality rates are measured by the number of babies who die before their first birthday, per thousand live births.\nThey're more than two times as likely to die as babies born to white mothers.\nThey're as likely to survive to a first birthday as kids born in Cyprus or Ukraine."}
