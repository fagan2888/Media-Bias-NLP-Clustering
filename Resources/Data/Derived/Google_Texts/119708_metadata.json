He needed, he said, to channel those feelings into positive energy for the hard court season.\n\nOn Sunday, Raonic followed through, beating Vasek Pospisil 6-1, 6-4, in the first ever all-Canadian men\u2019s final in ATP history. In doing so, Raonic capped off a nearly flawless week at the FitzGerald Tennis Center in Rock Creek Park.\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t have [responded] in a better way,\u201d said Raonic, who earned his sixth career ATP title and his first of 2014.\n\n\u201cI took that anger and disappointment that I dealt with during the break and to change things around here is good. But there\u2019s still a fire in me because of how I played that [Wimbledon] semifinal that is still going to get me going.\u201d\n\nRaonic, seeded second at the Citi Open, was all business this week winning five matches in as many days without dropping a set. He may have saved his best match for last, needing only 67 minutes to dispatch his countryman Pospisil, while winning 93 percent of his first service points and firing nine aces.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t read his serve at all,\u201d said the 13th break point opportunity of the final. \u201cYou kind of have to play the guessing game because the serve is so accurate and so fast. It\u2019s just a heavy serve so you can\u2019t just stand there and react. If you do, he\u2019s just going ace you so you kind of have to guess. He\u2019s just serving really well.\u201d\n\nIn Sunday\u2019s final, Raonic had his return game working as well, turning one of the biggest matches in Canadian tennis history into an early rout.\n\nRaonic broke Pospisil in the opening game of the match, before doing so twice more in the first set. Both players held serve for the first nine games of the second set, before Raonic broke Pospisil again, taking the final point and the Citi Open title on a cross court backhand winner.\n\n\u201cIt gives me a lot of confidence,\u201d Raonic said of beginning his hard court season with a win. \u201cI\u2019ve always said that hard courts are by far my favorite, and having done as well I did on clay and grass, it got me really excited for about this week and for that to be showing right away this week was great.\u201d\n\nRaonic will rise to No.6 in the world when the latest ATP rankings are released Monday, matching his career-high. It also the highest ranking ever achieved by a Canadian player.\n\nUltimately, he said, \u201cI want to be No.1 in the world.\u201d\n\nThe Raonic-Pospisil final is the just the latest milestone for Tennis Canada- the national governing body for the sport- which is in the midst of its greatest year to date.\n\nIn the last three months alone, Raonic became the first Canadian male to reach a Grand Slam quarterfinal (French Open) and semifinal (Wimbledon), while Eugenie Bouchard became the first Canadian woman to reach the final at a major (Wimbledon).\n\nRaonic and Bouchard are also the first Canadians to crack the top-10 in the ATP and WTA rankings.\n\n\u201cIt feels like there\u2019s history being made all the time or something,\u201d said Pospisil who teamed with American Jack Sock to win the gentlemen\u2019s doubles title at Wimbledon.\n\n\u201cAs a Canadian, I feel like I\u2019m hearing it all the time, whether it was at Wimbledon with Genie Bouchard or Milos, so yeah, it\u2019s nice.\u201d\n\nThe success can be seen across the board. In Saturday\u2019s Citi Open women\u2019s doubles final, Canadian Gabriela Dabrowski partnered with Shuko Aoyama of Japan for her first career WTA title.\n\n\u201cIn general in Canada, I can\u2019t tell you what\u2019s going on,\u201d said Dabrowski. \u201cMaybe people just don\u2019t feel like playing hockey anymore.\u201d\n\nBoth Raonic and Pospisil also expect a \u201crowdy\u201d atmosphere when they return to Canada next week for the country\u2019s showcase event, the Rogers Cup in Toronto.\n\nLike Raonic, Pospisil will also move up in rankings, jumping from No.36 to No.28.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s great,\u201d Raonic said of the support he and Pospisil received in Washington with Canadian flags and paraphernalia seen in the stadium.\n\n\u201cWith myself doing as well as I have, and Genie and Vasek and many more, it\u2019s something where that kind of atmosphere has been more consistent following us around the world. It\u2019s nice to see that.\u201d\n\nIn Sunday\u2019s men\u2019s doubles final, Jean-Julien Rojer and Horia Tecau beat Sam Groth and Leander Paes 7-5, 6-4.", "article_metadata": {"description": "On Sunday, Milos Raonic beat Vasek Pospisil in the first all-Canadian men's final in ATP history.
