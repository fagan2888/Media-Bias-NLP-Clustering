But that term is too easy. If you take a closer look, it turns out the better fit may be the \"wasted-time\" Congress.\n\nThe terms \"do-nothing\" and \"Congress\" may be so cemented together that the phrase no longer tells us much. At the moment, it may sound redundant.\n\nIn 2013, Congress spent more time at the office but got less done with it than at any time in recent history.\n\nHow much got done?\n\nLet's start there. There are many measures of congressional activity, but one has sparked the \"do-nothing\" label: Bills passed.\n\n\u2022 Bills passed 2013: 64\n\nJUST WATCHED Congress' moderates calling it quits Replay More Videos ...

The lowest figure during President George W. Bush's term was 136, double the amount passed this year.\n\nWait, bills passed does not mean \"good\" bills passed. This is true. And it is a key argument for Republicans especially.\n\n\"It's not how many bills you pass,\" Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Alabama, told CNN, \"It's how many you stop. A lot of them are bad.\"\n\nThis is what we're getting at here by bucking the \"do-nothing\" label. It does not capture the extent of the problem in Congress.\n\nHow else can you measure the mess on Capitol Hill?\n\nBy the hundreds of hours it took Congress to get so little done.\n\nDays in session? We could look at the days in session, which were officially more than 150 for both the House and Senate. That is average for the Senate and way above average for the House.\n\nBut those figures can be misleading: They include \"pro-forma\" sessions when the House and Senate are not really in Washington.\n\nInstead, consider time in session\n\n\u2022 Senate time in session: More than 1,098 hours.\n\n\u2022 House time in session: More than 786 hours. .\n\n\u2022 Relatively: That's higher than average for the Senate over the past 30 years. And lower than average for the House.\n\nAnd there were issues that both parties pledged to address, but left unresolved in that work time. To name a few:\n\n\u2022 Jobs, long-term unemployment\n\n\u2022 Immigration\n\n\u2022 Energy policy\n\nIn other words, Congress spent hundreds of hours in Washington -- far more than average for the Senate -- and still was not able to address most of the biggest issues of the day.\n\nJUST WATCHED Sen Paul: New budget is a step backwards Replay More Videos ...

Barbara Boxer, D-California, told CNN, her frustrated tone at odds with her bright holiday red sweater. \" Ridiculous... It's exhausting... It's been getting worse and worse every year. Exponentially. There are so many issues we could be dealing with, and we're so discouraged.\"\n\nThis is perhaps the greatest area of bipartisan agreement: Congress is in Washington, but doing less.\n\n\"I think we've been working less, to be honest with you,\" Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona, said as he left the last Senate vote of the year.\n\nWhen asked about the increased hours in the Senate, he was quick to respond, \"The number of hours doing nothing? Yes, absolutely.\"\n\nThere is a pervasive sense of frustration mixed with no clear path toward a better, more able Congress.\n\n\"I think a majority of the members are trying... and hope that getting back to where the Congress does its job is just right around the next corner,\" said Sen. Roy Blunt, R-Missouri, who previously served as the Republican whip in the House. He lowered is voice. \"And we keep turning that corner and finding out we're not there yet. And that's frustrating.\"\n\nIt is a combination of doing relatively little, but taking an enormous amount of time doing it.\n\n\"A lot of wasted time to me,\" Boxer repeated.", "article_metadata": {"description": "In 2013, Congress spent more time at the office but got less done with it than at any time in recent history.", "pubdate": "2013-12-21T14:32:53Z", "author": "By Lisa Desjardins, CNN Capitol Hill Reporter", "og": {"site_name": "CNN", "description": "In 2013, Congress spent more time at the office but got less done with it than at any time in recent history.", "pubdate": "2013-12-21T14:32:53Z", "url": "http://www.cnn.com/2013/12/21/politics/do-nothing-congress-2013/index.html", "image": "http://i.cdn.turner.com/cnn/.e/img/4.0/logos/cnn_logo_social.jpg", "type": "article"}, "section": "politics", "fb": {"app_id": 80401312489}, "thumbnail": "http://i.cdn.turner.com/cnn/.e/img/4.0/logos/cnn_logo_social.jpg", "source": "CNN", "vr": {"canonical": "http://www.cnn.com/2013/12/21/politics/do-nothing-congress-2013/index.html"}, "keywords": "politics, 'Do-nothing' Congress?
