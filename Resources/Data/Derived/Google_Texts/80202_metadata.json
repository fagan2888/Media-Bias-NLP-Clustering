Under the expansion, single people making about $16,000 would be eligible for Medicaid, and a family of four could earn about $33,000.\n\nMedicaid expansion was a key part of the ACA, but in 2012, the U.S. Supreme Court made it optional for states to participate in widening the percentage above the poverty level for eligibility.\n\nNovember also marked the start of open enrollment for the Health Insurance Marketplace. Finding the right kind of health insurance, or even what health insurance one might qualify for, can be confusing, Andrea Cheroske of the Flathead City-County Health Department said, but there is help available.\n\nCertified application counselors such as Cheroske are on hand at the Kalispell office to help shepherd people through the application process, for either open enrollment or Medicaid.\n\n\u201cPeople can come to us for assistance with applying for and enrolling for insurance through the healthcare marketplace,\u201d Cheroske said. \u201cThey can also call us if they have any questions if they\u2019re going through the process themselves.\u201d\n\nThe application counselors at the health department would typically help guide an applicant through the Healthcare.gov website, Cheroske said, because the process is the same for that and for Medicaid \u2013 both are income-based, and the applicant would find out if they are eligible for tax credits or for Medicaid coverage.\n\nCheroske also said anyone who is re-enrolling in the marketplace or who received notification of their insurance premiums increasing and have questions can also call for navigation help.\n\n\u201cIf it\u2019s insurance related and they\u2019re not sure where to go, then they can come to us,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is a really good service. It\u2019s free and we\u2019re not affiliated with any insurance company so it\u2019s unbiased help for whoever needs it.\u201d\n\nThe health insurance assistance crew at the health department can be contacted at (406) 758-2165, and the department\u2019s website is available at www.flatheadhealth.org.\n\nApplicants can also check www.apply.mt.gov or www.healthcare.gov to start the process themselves.\n\nThe health department and Kalispell Regional Medical Center will host an event to help people sign up for insurance on Saturday, Nov. 14 at KRMC\u2019s east/west dietary conference room.\n\nAccording to Gov. Steve Bullock\u2019s office, Medicaid expansion means an additional 70,000 people in Montana are eligible for health insurance coverage, though legislative fiscal analysts predict about 45,700 would participate in the next four years.\n\nThe state Legislature passed a compromise bill on Medicaid in the 2015 session, including aspects like the state needing a waive by the federal government for certain changes such as charging premiums and outsourcing the program\u2019s administration to Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Montana.\n\nThe plan also requires patients to make the maximum copayments allowed under federal law, which, when combined with premium payments, cannot exceed 5 percent of a household\u2019s income.\n\nAlso, people with incomes above the federal poverty line who don\u2019t pay their premiums will be dropped from the program. The governor\u2019s office said those who fall under the poverty line won\u2019t be kicked out if they don\u2019t pay, but those non-payments become a debt to the state that can be collected later. Some people, including Native American reservation populations and the medically frail, will be exempt from the requirements.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Flathead Beacon", "description": "It took three years and a compromise bill at the state Legislature, but on Nov. 2 Montana officially became the 30th state in the country to expand its Medicaid program...  more", "title": "Medicaid Expansion Now Official in Montana - Flathead Beacon", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://flatheadbeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/20150114_SOUTH_CAMPUS_011.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-11-10T11:40:45-06:00", "url": "http://flatheadbeacon.com/2015/11/10/medicaid-expansion-now-official-in-montana/", "type": "article"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f01d4f", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "MobileOptimized": 320, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://flatheadbeacon.com/wp-content/themes/flathead-beacon/library/images/win8-tile-icon.png", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/FlatheadBeacon", "section": "Front Page", "published_time": "2015-11-10T11:37:56-06:00", "modified_time": "2015-11-10T11:40:45-06:00"}, "google-site-verification": "x7bqQRTLUVbNNQe0HUJ0bnx_EXmr6uOwcIs_ZIT9n9g", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Steve Bullock\u2019s office, Medicaid expansion means an additional 70,000 people in Montana are eligible for health insurance coverage, though legislative fiscal analysts predict about 45,700 would participate in the next four years.\nAlso, people with incomes above the federal poverty line who don\u2019t pay their premiums will be dropped from the program.\nCurrently, the federal poverty level is $11,770 for a single person, and $24,250 for a family of four.\nUnder the expansion, single people making about $16,000 would be eligible for Medicaid, and a family of four could earn about $33,000.\nNovember also marked the start of open enrollment for the Health Insurance Marketplace."}
