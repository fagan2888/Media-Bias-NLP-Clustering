The election is years away, but Clinton is considered the heavy favorite and leads Biden by large margins in most public polling.\n\n\"Three years is four lifetimes in a presidential campaign, and this ultimately becomes a family decision and my wife is supportive,\" Biden continued. \"I absolutely have not said no. It\u2019s as likely that I don\u2019t run. I just truly haven\u2019t made up my mind.\"\n\n\n\nThe vice president was booked on \"The View\" primarily to talk about the Affordable Care Act. He pushed back at new attacks from Republicans that the sweeping law will eliminate more than two million jobs, a claim based in part on a report from the Congressional Budget Office.\n\n\"How many of you are single women with children in a dead-end job, you're there because of your healthy insurance, and you'd rather have the opportunity to spend the next couple years with your child,' Biden asked the audience,\" Biden asked the audience. \"You're trapped in that job because if you leave, you lose your health insurance. Now you'll be able to make an independent choice.\"\n\nThe vice president also cracked jokes Monday night on \"Late Night with Seth Meyers,\" an A-list guest for the comedian's debut as host of the popular NBC program. Meyers also asked Biden about his presidential ambitions and whether he plans to run in 2016.\n\n\"Well, you know, I was planning on making a major announcement tonight,\" Biden said with a smile. \"But I decided tonight's your night. So I hope you'll invite me back.\"", "article_metadata": {"description": "Appearing on &quot;The View,&quot; the vice president wouldn&#039;t say if he&#039;s running in 2016 but he touted his presidential credentials", "og": {"url": "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/joe-biden-on-2016-im-uniquely-qualified-to-be-president/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/02/25/c381997c-3f34-4a2f-b5cc-032010462824/thumbnail/1200x630/0fd5db342b661b9f5684b81ecd7026bf/465757477.jpg", "height": 630}, "type": "article", "description": "Appearing on \"The View,\" the vice president wouldn't say if he's running in 2016 but he touted his presidential credentials", "title": "Joe Biden on 2016: I'm uniquely qualified to be president"}, "twitter": {"description": "Appearing on \"The View,\" the vice president wouldn't say if he's running in 2016 but he touted his presidential credentials", "title": "Joe Biden on 2016: I'm uniquely qualified to be president", "app": {"url": {"ipad": "cbsnewsapp://news/joe-biden-on-2016-im-uniquely-qualified-to-be-president/", "iphone": "cbsnewsapp://news/joe-biden-on-2016-im-uniquely-qualified-to-be-president/", "googleplay": "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/joe-biden-on-2016-im-uniquely-qualified-to-be-president/"}, "country": "US", "name": {"ipad": "CBS News", "iphone": "CBS News", "googleplay": "CBS News"}, "id": {"ipad": 334256223, "iphone": 334256223, "googleplay": "com.treemolabs.apps.cbsnews"}}, "site": "@CBSPolitics", "image": "http://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/02/25/c381997c-3f34-4a2f-b5cc-032010462824/thumbnail/1200x630/0fd5db342b661b9f5684b81ecd7026bf/465757477.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "al": {"web": {"url": "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/joe-biden-on-2016-im-uniquely-qualified-to-be-president/"}, "android": {"app_name": "CBS News", "package": "com.treemolabs.apps.cbsnews"}, "ios": {"url": "cbsnewsapp://news/joe-biden-on-2016-im-uniquely-qualified-to-be-president/", "app_name": "CBS News", "app_store_id": 334256223}}, "robots": "index, follow", "fb": {"app_id": 1536620209892267}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/CBSPolitics"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd18c6\"", "article_summary": "Vice President Joe Biden, working the talk show circuit this week, said Tuesday he is \"uniquely qualified\" to be president.\nMeyers also asked Biden about his presidential ambitions and whether he plans to run in 2016.\nThe vice president was booked on \"The View\" primarily to talk about the Affordable Care Act.\nBiden said Mr. Obama trusts him to deliver on major tasks -- like the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq -- and that he has been an influential vice president.\nThe vice president also cracked jokes Monday night on \"Late Night with Seth Meyers,\" an A-list guest for the comedian's debut as host of the popular NBC program."}
