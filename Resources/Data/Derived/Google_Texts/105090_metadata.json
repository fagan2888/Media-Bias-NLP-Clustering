John Kasich rolled out a regulatory platform that includes a one-year moratorium on all major new rules to \u201cgive businesses a respite from the costs of Obama administration regulations and allow time to overhaul the regulatory process.\u201d\n\nThis proposed overhaul includes a mandatory cost-benefit analysis for all new regulations, a measure that other candidates \u2014retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson, Sen.

Rick Santorum (Pa.) and Sen. Lindsey Graham Lindsey GrahamTrump: Romney 'walks like a penguin' Romney should endorse Clinton Graham: I'm still not supporting Trump MORE (S.C.) \u2014 have also proposed.\n\nIn what Rubio calls a \u201cnational regulatory budget,\u201d he proposes agencies establish regulatory budget caps and balance costs and benefits.\n\nLast month, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush announced he would require regulators to live within a budget: Every dollar of a proposed rule\u2019s cost would require agencies to find a dollar in regulatory relief.\n\nNew Jersey Gov. Chris Christie has a similar plan. Under his \u201cregulatory zero\u201d rule, however, a regulation of equal cost must be set to expire or immediately removed for each new rule imposed.\n\nSen. Rand Paul Rand PaulOvernight Defense: VA chief 'deeply' regrets Disney remark; Senate fight brews over Gitmo Paul ties release of 9/11 docs to defense bill Will Ted Cruz let it go? MORE (Ky.) went a step further, saying he believes two rules should be repealed for each new one proposed.\n\nPaul has strongly advocated for rolling back agency\u2019s regulatory authority. Earlier this year, he introduced the House-passed Regulations from the Executive in Need of Scrutiny Act in the Senate to give Congress the final say over all major rules.\n\nThe bill failed to make it out of committee but attracted support from businesswoman Carly Fiorina and Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, both rival presidential candidates.\n\nFiorina said she plans to unilaterally roll back the rules Obama issued through executive orders and perform a top-to-bottom review of all new rules. In addition to cost-benefit analysis, she said, rules need to have expiration dates and Congress needs to have authority to oversee them.\n\n\u201cWe actually are no longer a nation of laws. We\u2019ve become a nation of rules,\u201d Fiorina said in an interview on RFD-TV earlier this month.\n\nOne of the most detailed plans comes from Santorum, who proposes repealing ObamaCare, the Dodd-Frank financial reform law and any Obama administration regulation with an annual economic impact greater than $100 million.\n\nWhile their plans differ, virtually all the candidates have regularly criticized the current state of regulation with fiery remarks and promises to take on federal red tape if elected.\n\n\u201cFrom Common Core to the IRS to the EPA, the Washington political machine\u2019s mind-numbing regulatory insanity and overreach needs to be burned to the ground so we can rebuild America,\u201d former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee declared in a statement to\n\nThe Hill.\n\nSome experts brush off the candidates\u2019 forceful language as an effort to win support from the conservative base on the campaign trail.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a throw-away,\u201d said James Thurber, professor of political science and director of the Center of the Congressional and Presidential Studies at American University.\n\n\u201cYes, they can have statements on general policy and budgets, but I don\u2019t think it gets many votes.\u201d\n\nTo be sure, the much smaller Democratic field has largely backed stronger rules on everything from gun control and campaign finance to Wall Street and the environment.\n\nThrow-away statements or not, the GOP rhetoric has not gone unnoticed by proponents of strong public health and safety protections, who warn that a Republican president, along with a GOP-led Congress, could spell disaster come 2017.\n\n\u201cIf what ends up happening is a blanket moratorium for any specific period of time, you\u2019re looking at a situation of no regulation whatsoever no matter how common-sense or reasonable it is,\u201d said Amit Narang, regulatory policy advocate for Public Citizen.\n\n\u201cThe fact that Republican candidates are proposing health and safety moratoriums shows how radical their intentions are when it comes to regulatory reform.\u201d\n\nThurber said the decision by some campaigns to issue formal platforms is likely to force others to follow suit.\n\n\u201cIn the iron law of emulation, when one candidate does it, the other candidates will jump on it,\u201d Thurber said.\n\nThus far, some candidates \u2014 businessman Donald Trump Donald TrumpTrump aide: 'Hillary is the one who\u2019s got a gender gap' Trump aide: Picking a woman or minority as VP would be 'pandering' Trump adviser: He will 'soften' on Muslim ban MORE, Sen. Ted Cruz Ted CruzEleven states sue Obama over transgender bathroom directive Poll: Clinton leads Trump in Wisconsin by double digits GOP senators propose sending ISIS fighters to Gitmo MORE (Texas), Jindal and Huckabee \u2014 have issued more general criticism of the regulatory process or targeted specific agencies.\n\nTrump, for example, has promised to make deep cuts to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and Department of Education budgets. He said the EPA comes out with a new regulation every week.\n\n\u201cWhat they do is a disgrace,\u201d he told \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d host Chris Wallace earlier this month.\n\nIn speeches on the campaign trail, Cruz has threatened to take on not only the EPA but the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and \u201cthe alphabet soup of federal regulators that have descended like locusts on small business,\u201d which he said would \u201cunchain booming economic growth.\u201d\n\nIn his energy plan, Jindal recommended overhauling the EPA. He suggested stripping the agency of its authority to issue rules that cost more than $100 million\n\nannually.\n\n\u201cThe EPA was not designed as a lawmaking body, but it has effectively become one, violating Congress\u2019 Constitutional authority,\u201d he says in his 43-page plan.\n\nThough Carson has yet to release his economic platform, a spokesman said it\u2019s coming and will include a section on regulatory reform.\n\n\u201cHe believes very strongly that regulations are one of the biggest stifling influences on the economy \u2014 poor regulations, ineffective regulations and unnecessary regulations,\u201d Doug Watts told The Hill on Tuesday.\n\nThough former Virginia Gov. Jim Gilmore has not released a plan, he has more generally said that government needs to get out of way of small businesses and entrepreneurs.\n\nThe campaigns of Graham and former New York Gov. George Pataki did not respond to questions from The Hill, but both have stated positions supporting fewer\n\nregulations.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "An analysis of candidates\u2019 platforms found a range of cost-cutting proposals.", "description": "An analysis of candidates\u2019 platforms found a range of cost-cutting proposals.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Lydia Wheeler", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "An analysis of candidates\u2019 platforms found a range of cost-cutting proposals.", "title": "GOP candidates pledge assault on Obama\u2019s regs", "url": "http://thehill.com/regulation/257690-gop-candidates-pledge-assault-on-obamas-regs", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/article_images/republicancnndebate_getty.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-01T06:17:42-05:00", "type": "article"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-01T06:17-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/regulation/257690-gop-candidates-pledge-assault-on-obamas-regs", "dcterms.date": "2015-10-22T06:00-04:00", "dcterms.creator": "Rebecca Dickson", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": ",Lindsey Graham, Donald Trump, Marco Rubio, Rand Paul, Ted Cruz,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-10-22T06:00:04-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-01T06:17:42-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/regulation/257690-gop-candidates-pledge-assault-on-obamas-regs", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "An analysis of candidates\u2019 platforms found a range of cost-cutting proposals.", "card": "summary", "title": "GOP candidates pledge assault on Obama\u2019s regs"}, "dcterms.title": "GOP candidates pledge assault on Obama\u2019s regs"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1fb3\"", "article_summary": "Fiorina said she plans to unilaterally roll back the rules Obama issued through executive orders and perform a top-to-bottom review of all new rules.\nADVERTISEMENTAn analysis of the candidates\u2019 regulatory platforms found cost-cutting proposals that range from formal policies to blanket vows to cracking down on particular agencies to doing away with many of President Obama\u2019s signature rules.\n\u201cHe believes very strongly that regulations are one of the biggest stifling influences on the economy \u2014 poor regulations, ineffective regulations and unnecessary regulations,\u201d Doug Watts told The Hill on Tuesday.\nIn what Rubio calls a \u201cnational regulatory budget,\u201d he proposes agencies establish regulatory budget caps and balance costs and benefits.\n\u201cIn the iron law of emulation, when one candidate does it, the other candidates will jump on it,\u201d Thurber said."}
