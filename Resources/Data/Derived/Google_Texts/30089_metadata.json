(Jim Lo Scalzo/European Pressphoto Agency)\n\nBob Dole, now 92 and in a wheelchair, made a rare return visit to Congress on Monday to celebrate this week\u2019s 25th anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act \u2014 the sort of big bipartisan triumph of yore that now seems unimaginable.\n\nHow, I asked Dole, can we get back to the days when Washington worked?\n\n\u201cGet us back in Congress,\u201d Dole quipped.\n\nIf only.\n\nThe Kansas Republican, in his nearly 28 years in the Senate, was one of the great legislators of the 20th century. But the sad truth is Dole, even if he wanted to serve, probably couldn\u2019t be elected to Congress as a Republican today, much less become Senate majority leader or the party\u2019s presidential nominee. Neither could George H.W. Bush, who signed the ADA into law. Both would be dubbed RINOs \u2014 Republicans in Name Only \u2014 because of their nasty habit of compromise.\n\n[How Bob Dole is leading the fight for the Eisenhower memorial]\n\nThere are several reasons for the decline in Washington\u2019s functionality, including the growing polarization of both parties and the obvious reality that Dole\u2019s Republican Party has gone particularly bonkers. Dole, joined in the Capitol complex by other veterans of the 1990 ADA effort \u2014Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah), House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer (D-Md.), former senator Tom Harkin (D-Iowa) and former congressman Steve Bartlett (R-Tex.) \u2014 spoke with disdain of the 50-odd Republican members of the House who refuse to compromise on anything: \u201cI don\u2019t know what they are,\u201d he said.\n\nBut Dole also attributed the decline to the lost art of friendship. \u201cWe were D\u2019s and R\u2019s, but beyond that we were friends,\u201d he said. \u201cWe worked together because it was the right thing to do.\u201d Dole spoke of \u201cfriends on both sides of the aisle\u201d scratching each other\u2019s backs. \u201cSometimes we\u2019d vote with Democrats, sometimes they would vote with us,\u201d he said. \u201cIn some cases you can\u2019t agree and you just vote. But I think in most cases you can work it out.\u201d\n\nDole\u2019s talk of friendship sounded particularly quaint on Monday, following another low in interpersonal relations on Capitol Hill. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.), struggling in his presidential bid, went on the Senate floor Friday and called Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a fellow Republican, a liar.\n\n\u201cNot only what he told every Republican senator, but what he told the press over and over and over again, was a simple lie,\u201d said Cruz, upset that McConnell allowed a vote to renew the Export-Import Bank despite what Cruz felt were assurances to the contrary. \u201cI cannot believe he would tell a flat-out lie.\u201d\n\n[Republicans turn on one another in battle over Export-Import Bank]\n\nHoyer singled out this \u201cegregious violation of civility\u201d \u2014 a break with the long-standing custom in the Senate of refraining from attacks on fellow members\u2019 integrity. With Dole nodding vigorous agreement, Hoyer also defended House Republican leaders in their struggles with rebellious conservatives. \u201cSpeaker Boehner, I think, is not the problem, but he has some people who are not cooperating with their own leadership,\u201d Hoyer said.\n\nAs would happen two decades later during the Obamacare fight, there were bitter partisan squabbles during the ADA debate, and some serious opposition from business. But there was a crucial difference. \u201cI never heard anyone ever say, \u2018No, we can\u2019t do it,\u2019 \u201d recalled Harkin, a key figure in both the ADA and Obamacare. \u201cThere was no one who said, \u2018No, we\u2019ve got to stop this.\u2019 \u201d\n\nDole, in retirement, has seen the change, too. In 2012, he pushed for the Senate to ratify a U.N. treaty protecting those with disabilities. But the Republicans rebuffed him, leaving America in the company of Congo and Ghana as nations that haven\u2019t joined the treaty.\n\nDole\u2019s view, that \u201c \u2018compromise\u2019 is not a bad word,\u201d prevailed in the days when ADA became law, before Newt Gingrich\u2019s rise. That\u2019s when members of the Greatest Generation, including war-wounded Dole, still dominated politics and governed with a sense that country was above party. The camaraderie of those times seemed anachronistic when reprised during Monday\u2019s commemoration at the Capitol.\n\nHatch spoke of crying tears of joy with Harkin after the ADA\u2019s passage, and he vouched that \u201cSteny Hoyer has always done a great job.\u201d Harkin hugged Hatch, who also spoke of his \u201clove\u201d for his colleagues in attendance. Hoyer praised the \u201cgreat legislators\u201d with him, particularly \u201cthe Babe Ruth of legislative experience,\u201d Dole. \u201cWe need more Bob Doles in the Congress,\u201d Hoyer said.\n\nFrail but sharp Dole, with his suit pants pulled up high, offered a bit of optimism, both for the future of bipartisanship \u2014 \u201cI see a little hope that things are going to get back to where they were,\u201d he said \u2014 and for his own longevity: \u201cI just turned 92 last Wednesday, and I\u2019m looking forward to my 102nd birthday.\u201d\n\nWait: That\u2019s 10 years \u2014 and a Senate term is only six.\n\nDole in \u201916?\n\nTwitter: @Milbank\n\nRead more from Dana Milbank\u2019s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook.", "article_metadata": {"description": "On the 25th anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act, similar bipartisan triumphs now seem unimaginable.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/danamilbank", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "On the 25th anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act, similar bipartisan triumphs now seem unimaginable.", "title": "Washington forgets the art of friendship", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/washington-forgets-the-art-of-friendship/2015/07/27/04dc6844-34ac-11e5-adf6-7227f3b7b338_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2015/07/27/Editorial-Opinion/Images/04862976.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@Milbank"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/washington-forgets-the-art-of-friendship/2015/07/27/04dc6844-34ac-11e5-adf6-7227f3b7b338_story.html", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "Dana Milbank, bob dole", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/danamilbank"}, "eomportal-uuid": "04dc6844-34ac-11e5-adf6-7227f3b7b338", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "Dana Milbank, bob dole"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdcc3b\"", "article_summary": "\u201cWe worked together because it was the right thing to do.\u201d Dole spoke of \u201cfriends on both sides of the aisle\u201d scratching each other\u2019s backs.\n\u201cWe need more Bob Doles in the Congress,\u201d Hoyer said.\n\u201cGet us back in Congress,\u201d Dole quipped.\nBut Dole also attributed the decline to the lost art of friendship.\nHow, I asked Dole, can we get back to the days when Washington worked?"}
