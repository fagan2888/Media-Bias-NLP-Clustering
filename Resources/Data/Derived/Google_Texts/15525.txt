Lemmon, SD

A Newcastle, Wyoming man died after an ATV broke through the ice on a lake in northern Perkins County in South Dakota.

A recovery crew pulled the body of 32-year-old Sam Lipp from Shadehill Lake Saturday morning.

Lipp was one of two men along with two children on the ATV when it went through the ice Friday afternoon.

The sheriff's department says the other man was able to crawl out of the water and onto the ice along with one of his children.

Two ice fishermen rescued the other child who went into the water.

Crews suspended their search for Lipp Friday night, before returning to the lake Saturday morning.
