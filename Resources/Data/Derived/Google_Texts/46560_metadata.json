Attendees will have the opportunity to meet with a trained professional and receive free one-on-one enrollment assistance to help them understand their options and enroll in a plan that fits their needs and budget.\n\n\u201cHaving access to quality, affordable healthcare is a fundamental human right, and with Martin Luther King Day of Service on the horizon, the subject of healthcare as a human right is all the more relevant,\u201d said David Elin, Illinois State Director for Enroll America and the Get Covered America campaign. \u201cAs we do our work in communities across Illinois, we\u2019re seeing is that people are hungry for information on how they can sign up in the Health Insurance Marketplace, and we\u2019re doing everything we can to connect them to coverage. Time is of the essence, though, and consumers have just a little over a month to enroll.\u201d\n\nThe event takes place just under a month before the February 15 deadline to enroll in coverage in the current open enrollment period. To help Illinois residents get covered before this upcoming deadline, other Get Covered America enrollment events will be taking place in Illinois throughout the rest of the open enrollment period. This year, those who don\u2019t have insurance may face a fine of $325 or 2% of their household income, whichever is higher.\n\nSince the current open enrollment period began on November 15, 2014, over 272,000 Illinoisans have obtained coverage through the health insurance marketplace. More than 80% of Illinoisans who enrolled received financial help paying for their plan.\n\nConsumers seeking to get enrolled at the event are asked to bring either their 2014 W-4 or pay stubs from the last two months, as well as a driver\u2019s license, U.S. Passport, or state identification card. Anyone seeking to renew their current Marketplace coverage, or who would like to see what new options they have should bring their Healthcare.gov account information. Consumers who can\u2019t attend Saturday\u2019s enrollment event can schedule an appointment with a trained navigator or assister by using Get Covered America\u2019s online connector tool, available at www.GetCoveredAmerica.org/connector.\n\n***To RSVP, please email acarl@enrollamerica.org***\n\nReverend Dr. Martin Luther KIng Jr gracing us with a smile.\n\nWhat: Get Covered America\u2019s MLK Weekend Enrollment Events\n\nWhen: Saturday, January 17 through Monday, January 19.
