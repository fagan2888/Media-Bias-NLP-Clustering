Any questions about whether the Affordable Care Act would still play a central role in Republican messaging against Democratic incumbents this cycle have been answered â€” at least in Arkansas.

Crossroads GPS, the non-profit arm of GOP-aligned American Crossroads, is kicking off a post-Labor Day, two-month, $2.5 million media campaign in the Razorback State with an ad targeting Sen. Mark Pryor on his support for the president's health care law.

Pryor is being challenged by Rep. Tom Cotton in a top pickup opportunity for Republicans.

The incumbent released an ad two weeks ago that got plenty of media buzz as he touted a couple benefits of the law. But he didn't refer to the legislation by name, so this latest GOP ad aims to fill in that gap. www.youtube.com/watch?v=M7TQPBUyIac

"On TV Mark Pryor talks about the health care law he helped pass," the ad's announcer says. "What he doesn't say is that law is Obamacare."

The Crossroads GPS ad follows one the group ran last month targeting seniors. It accused Pryor of pushing to raise the retirement age for Social Security and tagged him as "the deciding vote on Obamacare."

The race is rated Tilts Republican by the Rothenberg Political Report/Roll Call.
