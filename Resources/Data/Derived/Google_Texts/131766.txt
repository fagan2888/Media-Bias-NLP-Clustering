Monday on “The Alan Colmes Show,” Alan spoke with Fox Business Network host Gerri Willis about her new book, Rich Is Not A Four-Letter Word: How To Survive Obamacare, Trump, Wall Street, Kick-Start Your Retirement and Achieve Financial Success.

Willis and Alan discussed whether President Obama did enough to save the economy from the financial collapse of 2008, if a healthcare system like Canada is the answer for the United States, and how voters are looking to shake up politics by supporting Donald Trump for president.
