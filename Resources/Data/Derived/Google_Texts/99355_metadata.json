He is currently heading the transition of Obamacare enrollments to the federal marketplace, healthcare.gov, as the Connector prepares to end operations completely in 2016. The Connector was created by the federal Affordable Care Act to provide subsidized medical coverage to qualified residents.\n\n\u201cBased on my experience, I believe Hawaii has the potential to be the first state in the nation with a near zero uninsured rate as we continue to harmonize Hawaii\u2019s employer-provided insurance with the provisions of the Affordable Care Act,\u201d Kissel said. \u201cMy profession is energy and energy infrastructure and this offers me an opportunity to become part of an energy policy-making team for the country.\u201d\n\nKissel, who began his career as a crude oil trader in the midst of the oil crisis of the 1970\u2019s, previously was president and CEO of HawaiiGAS. There he helped to grow what started as a small business into a diversified organization in just five years. He also held senior roles and led strategy at URS, one of the world\u2019s largest engineering and construction companies. Kissel received bachelor\u2019s and master\u2019s of business administration degrees from the University of Hawaii at Manoa, where he was a Rhodes Scholarship finalist.\n\n\u201cWith more than 35 years experience in the energy sector as CEO, director, and chief strategy officer for some of America\u2019s largest energy and infrastructure organizations, Jeff brings a unique perspective to (Energy Policy Research Foundation\u2019s) team of policy specialists,\u201d said Lucian Pugliaresi, president of the Energy Policy Research Foundation.\n\nThe Energy Policy Research Foundation, founded in 1944, is a not-for-profit organization that studies energy economics and policy issues with special emphasis on oil, natural gas and petroleum product markets. It is funded by a variety of donors including foundations, the private sector and the U.S. government.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Honolulu Star-Advertiser", "description": "Jeff Kissel, the head of the Hawaii Health Connector, is leaving the state\u2019s Obamacare insurance exchange on Dec. 4 to join a public-policy energy think tank on the mainland.", "title": "Head of Hawaii Health Connector leaving for energy post | Honolulu Star-Advertiser", "url": "http://www.staradvertiser.com/business/head-of-hawaii-health-connector-leaving-for-energy-post/", "image": "http://www.staradvertiser.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/09-a1-Jeff-Kissel-PIX.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/staradvertiser/", "section": "Business", "tag": "news", "published_time": "2015-11-06T00:00:00-10:00"}, "fb": {"pages": 112299605447935}, "twitter": {"description": "Jeff Kissel, the head of the Hawaii Health Connector, is leaving the state\u2019s Obamacare insurance exchange on Dec. 4 to join a public-policy energy think tank on the mainland.", "creator": "@staradvertiser", "image": "http://www.staradvertiser.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/09-a1-Jeff-Kissel-PIX.jpg", "title": "Head of Hawaii Health Connector leaving for energy post | Honolulu Star-Advertiser", "site": "@staradvertiser", "card": "summary"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Head of Hawaii Health Connector leaving for energy postJeff Kissel, the head of the Hawaii Health Connector, is leaving the state\u2019s Obamacare insurance exchange on Dec. 4 to join a public-policy energy think tank on the mainland.\nKissel, 65, was named today Distinguished Fellow of Energy Policy Research Foundation Inc., a non-partisan group based in Washington, D.C.\n\u201cWith more than 35 years experience in the energy sector as CEO, director, and chief strategy officer for some of America\u2019s largest energy and infrastructure organizations, Jeff brings a unique perspective to (Energy Policy Research Foundation\u2019s) team of policy specialists,\u201d said Lucian Pugliaresi, president of the Energy Policy Research Foundation.\nThe Energy Policy Research Foundation, founded in 1944, is a not-for-profit organization that studies energy economics and policy issues with special emphasis on oil, natural gas and petroleum product markets.\nThe Connector was created by the federal Affordable Care Act to provide subsidized medical coverage to qualified residents."}
