In the U.K., it is also become a political issue because the number of obese welfare recipients has swelled.\n\nAccording to the Independent, many obese recipients have been able to claim welfare benefits and supplemental income due to other health issues they have as a result of obesity. However, most recipients\u2019 health issues could probably be resolved with weight loss. Now, Prime Minister David Cameron is proposing that welfare benefits be cut for individuals who refuse to lose weight or undergo weight loss surgery.\n\n\u201cThe next Conservative government is determined to make sure that the hardest to help get the support they need to get them back to a fulfilling life. Too many people are stuck on sickness benefits because of issues that could be addressed but instead are not. Some have drug or alcohol problems, but refuse treatment. In other cases people have problems with their weight that could be addressed, but instead a life on benefits rather than work becomes the choice.\u201d\n\nHowever, the proposal, which was introduced back in February, has been met with opposition. While some would consider Cameron\u2019s proposal to be quite effective, The Lancet Diabetes & Endocrinology argues the proposal is \u201cfar from ethical\u201d because no one should be forced to undergo surgery, reports RT.\n\n\u201cAlthough many people who claim sickness benefits for obesity might welcome the opportunity to take part in an intervention that helps them to lose weight, any mandated program should have a strong evidence base for success\u2026 Requiring people to undergo a major surgical procedure as a condition of receiving benefits seems far from ethical.\u201d\n\nOf course, the controversial topic has sparked quite a debate. Most taxpayers have long argued that welfare benefits only make obese recipients lazier. Over the past couple months, there have been many highly-publicized incidents were obese welfare recipients have claimed to be \u201ctoo fat to work\u201d and are \u201chappy\u201d with the lives they\u2019ve been afforded with the help of government benefits.\n\nWith financial support from the government, some argue there is no incentive to lose weight or seek help to resolve their health issues. Many taxpayers definitely agree Cameron\u2019s proposal could be an effective way to save money and combat obesity. Needless to say, some readers definitely had brash responses for to The Lancelot\u2019s arguments.\n\nHere are some of the comments.\n\n\u201cIt is not a question of cutting their benefit, but making their benefit dependent on them seeking treatment or therapy for their obesity\u2026 and quite right too!\u2026 there is no right to be a parasite!\u201d \u201cAs it should be, people should not be allowed to be burden on the rest of society. I believe in providing for those who cannot do for themselves, but, I resent the heck out of having to provide for those who simply WILL NOT do for themselves.\u201d \u201cAnd the ones who make excuses like, \u2018I just can\u2019t stop eating.\u2019 But most of them lie and claim they don\u2019t eat that much, \u2018it\u2019s my metabolism.\u2019 Sure, tell me another, if anyone ate what you claim they\u2019d be thin as a rail period.\u201d\n\nDo you think obese welfare recipients should be forced to have weight loss surgery or lose benefits?
