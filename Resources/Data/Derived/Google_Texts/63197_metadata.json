The report acknowledges while the two Hispanic media outlets are fair when it comes to international stories, but when it comes to domestic U.S. policy coverage, there are \u201cleft-leaning sources overwhelmingly dominating U.S. coverage.\u201d\n\nThe report finds that in a study of over 600 news stories in total, both networks presented the report with a liberal tilt 45 percent of the time, compared to 6 percent in the conservative direction. It also points to a glaring lack of coverage from both networks on a number of Obama administration scandals and how both networks brought on far more pro-Obamacare guests than opponents.\n\nHowever, representatives from both networks have pushed back at the accusations of bias in statements to POLITICO. A Telemundo spokesperson said, \u201cThe journalistic principles that rule our work ensure that our news coverage is transparent, impartial and factual.\u201d Someone who used to work for both networks told POLITICO the dearth of conservative guests isn\u2019t for lack of trying.\n\n\u201cI can tell you in no uncertain terms that the predominant reason why Republicans and conservatives are not seen more or cited more on Spanish-language news outlets is their own refusal to comment or be interviewed by the networks and publications that Hispanics read and watch the most.\u201d\n\nOn the Obamacare criticism, a Univision spokesperson argued that Hispanics are a large community that \u201ccan benefit the most from the ACA,\u201d and their coverage is \u201ca public service to the Hispanic community, not a service to the Administration, conservatives, liberals or moderates.\u201d\n\n[h/t POLITICO]\n\n[photo via screengrab]\n\n\u2014 \u2014\n\nFollow Josh Feldman on Twitter: @feldmaniac", "article_metadata": {"description": "The conservative Media Research Center put out a report today concluding that both Telemundo and Univision have a clear liberal bias in their reporting, but", "generator": "WordPress 2016.21", "og": {"image": "http://static01.mediaite.com/med/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/telemundo-univision.jpg", "title": "Media Watchdog Group Says Telemundo, Univision Have Liberal Bias, Networks Fire Back"}, "twitter": {"description": "The conservative Media Research Center put out a report today concluding that both Telemundo and Univision have a clear liberal bias in their reporting, but both networks disputed the report and fired back that they're fair news outlets with no political agenda.", "title": "Media Watchdog Group Says Telemundo, Univision Have Liberal Bias, Networks Fire Back", "image": "http://static01.mediaite.com/med/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/telemundo-univision.jpg", "creator": "@feldmaniac", "site": "@mediaite", "card": "summary"}, "NextGEN": "1.5.5", "date": "2014-04-01T22:31:43+00:00", "keywords": "online", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.5, minimum-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd26d\"", "article_summary": "The conservative Media Research Center put out a report today concluding that both Telemundo and Univision have a clear liberal bias in their reporting.\nHowever, representatives from both networks have pushed back at the accusations of bias in statements to POLITICO.\nIt also points to a glaring lack of coverage from both networks on a number of Obama administration scandals and how both networks brought on far more pro-Obamacare guests than opponents.\nA Telemundo spokesperson said, \u201cThe journalistic principles that rule our work ensure that our news coverage is transparent, impartial and factual.\u201d Someone who used to work for both networks told POLITICO the dearth of conservative guests isn\u2019t for lack of trying.\nThe report acknowledges while the two Hispanic media outlets are fair when it comes to international stories, but when it comes to domestic U.S. policy coverage, there are \u201cleft-leaning sources overwhelmingly dominating U.S. coverage.\u201dThe report finds that in a study of over 600 news stories in total, both networks presented the report with a liberal tilt 45 percent of the time, compared to 6 percent in the conservative direction."}
