If by \u201cone of us\u201d the writer meant someone who has not been practicing law, he was correct.\n\nBaker has been serving as Portage County Clerk of Courts for over four years, and while the office performs a vital role in county government, it is a non-lawyer position.\n\nThe minimum qualifications necessary to run for circuit court judge are that you must be licensed to practice law in Wisconsin for five years immediately prior to the election, be a U.S. citizen who is 18 years old or older and have lived in the county for at least 28 consecutive days before the election.\n\nBaker has been licensed to practice law in Wisconsin for the last five years, but she has not been practicing for more than four.\n\nThe clerk of courts oversees the keeping of records, billing and official correspondence of the courts. The clerk\u2019s office has a sign that states that the staff cannot give legal advice. That is because the clerk and her staff are not practicing attorneys.\n\nBaker has satisfied the minimum standards for continuing legal education credits in order to keep her law license, but has not been actively engaged in the practice of law for more than four years. She has been working in other areas of the community, but the fact remains that she has not been involved in the daily application of legal principles in a system where the law is constantly evolving.\n\nThe legal experience that Baker lists as qualifications consists of part-time positions as Assistant District Attorney in other counties and a short period of time as a private criminal defense attorney.\n\nWhile Baker\u2019s qualifications do meet the bare standard for eligibility, she is clearly not the most qualified candidate.\n\nLisa Pett,\n\nStevens Point\n\nAll letters commenting on Feb. 16 primaries must be submitted by noon Feb. 8.
