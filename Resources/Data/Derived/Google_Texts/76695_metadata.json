The average paycheck has not kept up with the cost of living in decades and now working people in the Garden State and the rest of the country have had still more pain spread their way.\n\nHas it been painful for corporations in New Jersey, where Gov. Chris Christie's approved $5.4 billion in corporate tax cuts since 2010 and, last month, vetoed a measure that would allow taxpayers to evaluate if those subsidies are working? I hope you are not asking New Jersey wage earners, for whom every dollar counts, to take yet another hit while they're picking up the check for corporate welfare.\n\nJim LaRegina, Westfield\n\nFollow The Star-Ledger on Twitter @starledger.
