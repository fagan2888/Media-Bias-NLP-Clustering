They also had plenty of stories to share.\n\n\u201cSome of them we can\u2019t tell,\u201d 91-year-old B.W. Crabtree joked Saturday.\n\nCrabtree was integral in helping RSVP Events find out where former American Tobacco employees lived so they could attend the celebration.\n\nCrabtree, a former shipping supervisor, said he\u2019s thankful for what tobacco meant to his working life \u2013 which started in Durham in 1953.\n\n\u201cTobacco is not a good word anymore, but it\u2019s been mighty good to me,\u201d he said. \u201cIt educated my two children. It has helped me get one of my sons through college.\u201d\n\nWhen American Tobacco left Durham in the late 1980s, Crabtree had spent 35 years with the company.\n\n\u201cIt was a sad day. We knew that we would never have another job that would be as good to us as American Tobacco was,\u201d he said. \u201cIf somebody\u2019s family had problems, it would be our problems.\u201d\n\nSharon Heath-Riley, the organizer of Saturday\u2019s reunion event, said American Tobacco was \u201ccontemporary\u201d in how it treated its employees.\n\n\u201cThey had on-site healthcare. They had the womb-to-tomb title, where you could be treated here from the time you were born to the day you die,\u201d she said.\n\nWhen American Tobacco shut down operations, it left the area in bad shape. The dusty, warehouse-filled space on the edge of downtown Durham had little appeal.\n\nThat changed thanks to a $200 million renovation by the Goodmon family. It has turned the area into a thriving city center with restaurants and offices space that has drawn more development, including the Durham Performing Arts Center.\n\nCapitol Broadcasting Company, the parent company of WRAL, also owns the American Tobacco Campus.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30;polling-uri=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.wral.com/rss/48&id=1;polling-uri2=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.wral.com/rss/48&id=2;polling-uri3=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.wral.com/rss/48&id=3;polling-uri4=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.wral.com/rss/48&id=4;polling-uri5=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.wral.com/rss/48&id=5;cycle=1", "dcterms.created": "2014-09-06 14:06:00", "description": "More than 150 former American Tobacco factory workers returned to their old stomping grounds on Saturday to help celebrate the 10-year anniversary of the campus' reboot.", "application-name": "WRAL.com", "dcterms.modified": "2014-09-07 17:33:22", "outbrain": {"ob_desc": "id_asset=13957691|asset_type=story"}, "twitter": {"description": "More than 150 former American Tobacco factory workers returned to their old stomping grounds on Saturday to help celebrate the 10-year anniversary of the campus' reboot.", "title": "Former workers return to American Tobacco after 'remarkable reboot' :: WRAL.com", "url": "http://www.wral.com/former-workers-return-to-american-tobacco-after-remarkable-reboot-/13957691/", "image": "http://wwwcache.wral.com/asset/news/local/2014/07/24/13838808/13838808-1407330812-160x120.jpg", "site": "@wral", "card": "summary"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#041E30", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "/favicons/mstile-70x70.png", "robots": "index,follow", "pinterest": "nohover", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "/favicons/mstile-310x310.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "/favicons/mstile-310x150.png", "fb": {"app_id": 334167666672300}, "author": "WRAL", "article": {"published_time": "2014-09-06T14:06:00-04:00"}, "msapplication-square150x150logo": "/favicons/mstile-150x150.png", "og": {"site_name": "WRAL.com", "description": "More than 150 former American Tobacco factory workers returned to their old stomping grounds on Saturday to help celebrate the 10-year anniversary of the campus' reboot.", "title": "Former workers return to American Tobacco after 'remarkable reboot' :: WRAL.com", "url": "http://www.wral.com/former-workers-return-to-american-tobacco-after-remarkable-reboot-/13957691/", "image": "http://wwwcache.wral.com/asset/news/local/2014/07/24/13838808/83289-AmericanTobaccoCampus-728x485.jpg", "type": "article"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "msapplication-TileImage": "/favicons/mstile-144x144.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd0d9\"", "article_summary": "Capitol Broadcasting Company, the parent company of WRAL, also owns the American Tobacco Campus.\nCrabtree was integral in helping RSVP Events find out where former American Tobacco employees lived so they could attend the celebration.\nWe knew that we would never have another job that would be as good to us as American Tobacco was,\u201d he said.\nIt has helped me get one of my sons through college.\u201dWhen American Tobacco left Durham in the late 1980s, Crabtree had spent 35 years with the company.\nWhen American Tobacco shut down operations, it left the area in bad shape."}
