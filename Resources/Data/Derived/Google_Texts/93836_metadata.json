Obamacare started out with more special enrollment periods, which include periods for people who lost their insurance, got married, or got divorced.\n\nBut those periods enabled people to sign up for Obamacare when they got sick, or drop out when they got better, which raised premiums for everyone else. Eliminating those special periods could help insurance companies stay in the black on Obamacare enrollments.\n\nOther helpful measures could be an updated risk adjustment model, which pays insurers in an effort to help them cover substantial losses. Risk adjustment was put in place to help insurers adjust to the creation of the new Obamacare marketplace.\n\nAnthem wasn't specific, but it supports a tweak to the formula that increases those payments.\n\n\"When you put all of that together \u2026 I think a sustainable model can be built,\" Swedish said.\n\nAnthem has a bigger presence in Obamacare than UnitedHealth, which has a broader portfolio to cushion any exit from the marketplaces.\n\nAnthem's executives didn't disclose how many of their enrollees were new or shifted to an Anthem plan. They did say that the closure of taxpayer-funded consumer oriented and operated plans did help with the enrollment boost.\n\nSo far, about 12 of the 23 co-op plans have shut down, and many have cited a lack of federal funding.\n\n\"I would say we picked up more than our market share,\" said Wayne DeVeydt, Anthem's chief financial officer.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A major Obamacare insurer on Wednesday cited higher enrollment in Obamacare exchanges so far this year, and said it remains committed to the healthcare exchanges.\nAnthem, which owns Blue Cross/Blue Shield, reported that enrollment in Obamacare's exchanges was better than expected, and said it has enrolled 975,000 people, a boost of nearly 200,000 people compared to 2015.
