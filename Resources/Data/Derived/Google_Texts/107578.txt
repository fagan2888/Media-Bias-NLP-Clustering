Vail blew by Aspen in single-day lift-ticket pricing for the holidays.

Vail Mountain has raised its single-day rate at its walk-up ticket counters to $139, a ticket agent for the resort confirmed Thursday. Beaver Creek, Vail’s sister resort, also is charging $139. Breckenridge and Keystone, also under the Vail Resorts umbrella, are charging $129 and $119 respectively.

Aspen Skiing Co. raised its walk-up-window rate to $124 last weekend. That is expected to be the peak for the season, according to Skico spokesman Jeff Hanle.

Skico’s lift ticket is good at Aspen Mountain, Aspen Highlands, Snowmass and Buttermilk. Skico doesn’t sell individual tickets to its four ski areas. In other words, a person skiing Buttermilk pays the same as someone skiing Aspen Mountain.
