Ellen Roberts won \u201cbest actress in a leading role.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo deeply immersed in character she\u2019s barely recognizable,\u201d was the description of the Durango Republican.\n\nThe award from Democratic Sen. Pat Steadman, who does an annual Oscars list, was a sly reference to what people under the Gold Dome had been talking about for a couple of years.\n\nRoberts\u2019 reputation was as a moderate when she was first elected to the legislature in 2006, but Capitol regulars saw what they thought was a shift to the right. When Republicans took control of the state Senate after last November\u2019s election, her conservative caucus elected her Senate president pro tem. That escalated the conversation.\n\n\u201cPeople were saying, \u2018Hey, you took on a leadership role. You sold out and you became a right-wing wacko,\u2019 \u201d Roberts said in an interview earlier this year when asked about her Oscar.\n\n\u201cDefinitely, my views have changed over the years. I actually thought Republicans were the mean ones. Then I found out that folks on the other side of the aisle, could be really, really mean, whether it\u2019s at the Capitol or at home.\u201d\n\nWhere Roberts stands on the issues has become increasingly more important in recent weeks as she mulls whether to challenge Democrat Michael Bennet in next year\u2019s U.S. Senate race.\n\nColorado has never elected a woman to the U.S. Senate \u2014 or as governor \u2014 and a number of people believe it\u2019s time. Democrats admitted that\u2019s one of the reasons they initially were worried about Roberts\u2019 candidacy, but they have gleefully watched Roberts stumble in recent weeks as she explains her views on reproductive rights.\n\nShe admitted in a recent interview it hasn\u2019t been smooth.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m pretty unscripted. I pride myself on being a real person. It\u2019s what I\u2019ve received the most positive feedback on from my constituents,\u201d she said. \u201cPerhaps my downfall is in not trying to change that on what is a much more intense stage, even though I\u2019m just thinking about running for the Senate.\u201d\n\nOnly three Colorado women have ever received a major party\u2019s nomination for the U.S. Senate, and only one came close to winning: Secretary of State Mary Estill Buchanan, a Republican. She lost in 1980 to Democratic U.S. Sen. Gary Hart, 50.3 percent to 48.7 percent, as President Jimmy Carter\u2019s unpopularity soared.\n\nLaura Hoeppner is co-producing and writing the film \u201cStrong Sisters,\u201d about women in Colorado politics. Barriers to women running for higher office, she said, include raising money, wanting to avoid the toxic atmosphere that politics has become and avoiding negative impact on their children, particularly if the women have to commute between Colorado and Washington.\n\nRoberts, who has two grown children, was first elected to the legislature in 2006. Knowing that her pro-choice views turned off conservatives in her House district, a Democratic group paid for fliers that landed the Friday before the election saying she supported abortion on demand. Roberts nonetheless prevailed in what was a banner year for Democrats.\n\nForest health, water, health care reform, public lands and judicial matters were the issues that interested Roberts, an attorney whose husband, Rick, works in construction. At the end of her first session, Capitol regulars picked Roberts as one of the year\u2019s best freshmen.\n\nShe ran for the state Senate in 2010 in a race that again attracted unusual Democratic spending. A Tea Party candidate had surprised Roberts, nearly keeping her off the primary ballot. Democrats mailed fliers to Republican voters intended to bolster the Tea Party challenger because he was deemed easier to defeat in November than Roberts.\n\nShe won the primary and the general.\n\n\u201cI think I fit the state,\u201d said Roberts, whose daily outfit often includes a string of pearls from her late father and a pair of cowboy boots.\n\nRoberts was appointed in February to serve as chairwoman of a committee overseeing Colorado\u2019s troubled health care exchange, where her performance has drawn praise from both sides of the aisle.\n\nAfter the session ended in May, Roberts told her hometown paper she was looking at a Senate run. \u201cI recognize it would be a longshot,\u201d the 55-year-old said.\n\nThe Durango Herald noted Roberts would have to survive a partisan primary, which typically supports the more conservative candidate, and pointed out that Roberts supports gay rights and is pro-choice.\n\nThat\u2019s when things got interesting.\n\nWhen it comes to reproductive rights, Roberts said abortion-rights advocates are upset that she supports parental notification, while abortion foes are mad because she believes it should be legal.\n\nAfter Roberts said she was looking at the Senate race, Planned Parenthood Votes Colorado told the Herald it no longer considered Roberts a moderate or an ally on women\u2019s health issues.\n\nThe group pointed to Roberts\u2019 recent votes, including her support for a measure in the 2015 session that would have created a fetal homicide law in Colorado. The bill failed after Democrats opposed the measure, saying it was in essence \u201cpersonhood,\u201d which defines a fetus as a person and makes it easier to outlaw abortion.\n\nDemocrats also pointed to Roberts\u2019 interview with The Nation. She was asked about a state program that has reduced teen pregnancies by 40 percent by providing long-acting contraceptives. A bill to extend the program died in a Senate Republican committee this session.\n\nSome critics questioned the need for funding such a program, as no-cost birth control was already provided by the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cRepublican Sen. Ellen Roberts told me she might have supported the bill if she\u2019d had a good answer for that,\u201d columnist Katha Pollit wrote. \u201cLuckily, thanks to my access to the Internet and a telephone, I was able to help her out.\u201d\n\nIn some cases, insurance companies are refusing to cover the more expensive, more effective contraceptives.\n\nRoberts said she should have been aware she was talking to a liberal columnist, and explained more clearly that she already had told GOP leaders if the bill made it to the Senate floor, she would support it.\n\nRoberts told conservative talk radio host Dan Caplis on June 3, \u201cI\u2019ve never called myself pro-choice as a politician.\u201d The very next day, the liberal group ProgressNow Colorado posted of a video clip of Roberts talking on the Senate floor in 2011 on a religious liberties measure, where she identified herself in a debate as a \u201cpro-choice Republican.\u201d\n\nThe headline of the blog post: \u201cSeven seconds that could end Ellen Roberts\u2019 political career.\u201d\n\nRepublicans groaned, imagining the attack ad. The question now is whether the self-inflicted wounds will cause permanent damage.\n\nYes, said Andrew Zucker, spokesman for the Colorado Democratic Party.\n\n\u201cIf the bar for Republicans was low before Ellen Roberts said she might be running,\u201d he said, \u201csomehow she\u2019s managed to trip over it by inexplicably changing her position on issues, refusing to answer questions and making clear to voters that she can\u2019t be trusted.\u201d\n\nNo, said Dick Wadhams, former chairman of the Colorado Republican Party.\n\n\u201cEllen is too substantive and credible of a candidate,\u201d he said.\n\nWadhams also pointed to the 2014 Senate race, where Republican Congressman Cory Gardner defeated Democrat Sen. Mark Udall in a race where Udall was accused of focusing too much on women\u2019s issues.\n\nRoberts isn\u2019t the only one being talked about for the Senate race. After Congressman Mike Coffman of Aurora announced earlier this month he wouldn\u2019t take on Bennet next year, other names surfaced.\n\nThey include Senate President Bill Cadman of Colorado Springs, state Treasurer Walker Stapleton, Attorney General Cynthia Coffman, Arapahoe County District Attorney George Brauchler, former Senate Minority Leader Mike Kopp of Jefferson County, U.S. Rep. Scott Tipton of Cortez, businessman Robert Blaha of Colorado Springs, former Solicitor General Dan Domenico and state Sen. Owen Hill of Colorado Springs.\n\nEl Paso County Commissioner Darryl Glenn announced in January he was running for the Republican nomination for the U.S. Senate.\n\nRoberts said her stances did change after she got elected to the Senate, in part because she no longer represented just the liberal-based Durango, but also conservative constituents in Cortez, Montrose and elsewhere in the eight counties she represents.\n\nShe said Democrats changed, too, particularly after their victories in 2012. She pointed to 2013 measures expanding gun-control laws and increasing tougher renewable-energy standards \u2014 bills that led to the first ever recall of state lawmakers and a tough re-election bid for Gov. John Hickenlooper.\n\nBut Roberts sided with Senate Democrats on some issues, including measures to allow gay couples to form civil unions. Roberts voted for all three civil union bills: the 2011 bill died in committee; the 2012 bill died a dramatic death on the House floor; and the 2013 bill was signed into law. Steadman, who is gay, sponsored the bills.\n\nWhen Steadman called out Roberts in February with his Oscar, she replied on Twitter: \u201ctop honors, no less- how kind! But, perhaps, I am more complicated than you thought \u2026 :)\u201d\n\nLynn Bartels: 303-954-5327, lbartels@denverpost.com or twitter.com/lynn_bartels\n\nColorado women running for the u.s. senate\n\n2014: Former state House Majority Leader Amy Stephens dropped out of the GOP primary after U.S. Rep.
