So long as Colorado remains decidedly purple in its outlook, it will stay a key swing state.\n\nUnfortunately, the attention occurs only after the parties\u2019 respective candidates are selected. In the run-up to the nominations, Colorado is almost an afterthought both in terms of campaign and national media attention, thanks in large part to this state\u2019s antiquated caucus system.\n\nFortunately, some lawmakers are reportedly poised to tackle the caucus system in the waning days of the session and create a presidential primary to boost Colorado\u2019s influence.\n\nWe\u2019ve long supported moving back to a presidential primary (the state held them in 1992, 1996 and 2000) as a way to enhance Colorado\u2019s impact and, more importantly, increase voter participation.\n\nEven in years of high excitement in the caucuses \u2014 such as 2008 for Democrats \u2014 they attract far fewer voters than would turn out at a primary. As a result, they are less representative of genuine sentiment within a party.\n\nBut returning to a closed primary available only to registered Democrats and Republicans isn\u2019t good enough anymore, either.\n\nIt so happens that the largest group of voters in Colorado, and still growing as a percentage of the total, is unaffiliated. It\u2019s time to let them participate in primaries without having to declare for a party.\n\nThe change would be healthy for voters and candidates, too, who would have to broaden their appeal beyond party activists.\n\nThis is not a radical idea. Many states feature some form of open or semi-open primary system in which the unaffiliated have a role. Among the options, a semi-open primary is best. It gives unaffiliated voters a voice without allowing those registered to a party to cast a ballot in another party\u2019s primary \u2014 opening the door to attempts to sabotage a rival party\u2019s primary.\n\nBut would lawmakers ever approve even a semi-open primary and thus dilute the power of partisan activists? Probably not. It will very likely take a ballot initiative to bring this sensible reform to Colorado\u2019s nominating process.\n\nTo send a letter to the editor about this article, submit online or check out our guidelines for how to submit by e-mail or mail.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "A welcome move toward presidential primaries in Colorado", "title": "A welcome move toward presidential primaries in Colorado", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/04/24/a-welcome-move-toward-presidential-primaries-in-colorado/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150424_045303_OP27PRIMARY.jpg", "height": 402}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150424_045303_OP27PRIMARY.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-04-24T16:54:26+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-25T13:55:17+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Many states feature some form of open or semi-open primary system in which the unaffiliated have a role.\nBut would lawmakers ever approve even a semi-open primary and thus dilute the power of partisan activists?\nFortunately, some lawmakers are reportedly poised to tackle the caucus system in the waning days of the session and create a presidential primary to boost Colorado\u2019s influence.\nAmong the options, a semi-open primary is best.\nAs most Colorado voters know, their state has become one of the most highly sought prizes in presidential politics, attracting far more attention (and spending) than its population would seem to warrant."}
