Neil Patrick Harris fell into David Letterman\u2019s trap of telling jokes for the home audience (or in NPH\u2019s case, Twitter) at the expense of the live one. The dead silence that followed many of his jokes made him seem like a man flopping on open mic night.\n\nIt was a drawn-out ordeal. The ceremony ran past midnight, with most of the major awards not doled out until after 11:30 p.m. (EST).\n\nRelated: The 12 Most Momentous Movie Flops\n\nIt\u2019s not as if there wasn\u2019t fat that could have been trimmed from the ceremony. There were the usual ill-advised dance numbers, the speech from the president of the Academy, the highlights from the pre-recorded tech awards, not to mention the song after the death montage. Even Lady Gaga\u2019s performance, an unexpected highlight of the evening, was part of a tribute to The Sound of Music that had little to do with the awards.\n\nIn fact, for an evening that ran so long, there wasn\u2019t much to remember. Only a few moments spring to mind: Lady Gaga and Tim McGraw\u2019s performances, Patricia Arquette\u2019s speech, NPH in his underwear. And John Travolta somehow managed to make things even worse with poor Idina Menzel.\n\nIt didn\u2019t help that the favorites won in almost every category. With the exception of the coin flip for Boyhood vs. Birdman (even that had been tipping in Birdman\u2019s favor for a while), everything happened as expected - there was no surprise as Eddie Redmayne or Julianne Moore took the stage for best actor and actress, respectively. There was maybe some early excitement when The Grand Budapest Hotel started sweeping the early awards, as if this was the beginning of a wave, but then Wes Anderson would win for production design and costumes, wouldn\u2019t he?\n\nRelated: 2014 Oscar Nominees\u2019 15 Worst Movies\n\nIt\u2019s perhaps appropriate, then, to say that this might have been the most forgettable Oscars in recent memory. There has been an overriding sense that this year\u2019s nominees were not the best Hollywood has to offer, but simply the best they had to offer this year. Much has been made of the lack of diversity in the nominees, and it\u2019s a fair complaint, but increasingly the nominations just feel routine. Julianne Moore may have been great in Still Alice, but no one saw it. In the end, she was awarded for being Julianne Moore. Jared Leto even joked that California law required Meryl Streep to be nominated every year.\n\nSure, Eddie Redmayne is fresh blood, but he won for the definition of an Oscar-baiting role in a film unlikely to be rewatched. Be honest: How likely are you to re-watch A Beautiful Mind? Or My Left Foot?\n\nAt the end of the day, Birdman may very well have won for being the most original thing in a tedious year, but is that enough for Hollywood?\n\nHopefully, 2015 will offer something more exciting.\n\nTop Reads From The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The glitter has been swept up, the last denizens of the after-parties have staggered h", "title": "Oscars 2015: Predictability Makes a Long Night Longer", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/02/23/Oscars-2015-Predictability-Makes-Long-Night-Longer", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/oscars.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/02/23/Oscars-2015-Predictability-Makes-Long-Night-Longer", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/oscars.jpg", "creator": "@DrMonkeyPHD", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "The glitter has been swept up, the last denizens of the after-parties have staggered h", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda1e0\"", "article_summary": "Julianne Moore may have been great in Still Alice, but no one saw it.\nIn the end, she was awarded for being Julianne Moore.\nThe dead silence that followed many of his jokes made him seem like a man flopping on open mic night.\nThe ceremony ran past midnight, with most of the major awards not doled out until after 11:30 p.m. (EST).\nRelated: The 12 Most Momentous Movie FlopsIt\u2019s not as if there wasn\u2019t fat that could have been trimmed from the ceremony."}
