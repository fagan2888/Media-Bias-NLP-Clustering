GREAT FALLS, Mont. (AP) — The U.S. Air Force is being criticized for a decision to relocate military air tanker equipment used to fight wildfires to Nevada instead of Montana.

Montana Sen. Sen. Steve Daines sent a letter to the Air Force asking why Nevada was chosen for the Modular Airborne Firefighting Systems, which includes equipment that can be installed in C-130 cargo plans to drop retardant on wildfires.

According to the Great Falls Tribune (http://tinyurl.com/z4yhu7g ), the system can be used by governors where the Air National Guard flight crews operate it. That also includes Wyoming. Colorado uses an Air Force Reserve Command unit. The Department of Defense provides the aircraft.

A National Guard spokesman says all Air National Guard C-130 units were considered, including the Montana Air National Guard.
