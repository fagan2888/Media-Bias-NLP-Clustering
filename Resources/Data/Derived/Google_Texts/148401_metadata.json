The 245-page publication provides religious population estimates as of 2050 for each of the 198 nations and territories that have populations of 100,000 and above, by calculating such factors as birth rates, age distribution, migration, life expectancy and rates of switching between religions in 70 nations for which we have data.\n\nThe headline item was the Pew team\u2019s estimate that \u201cby 2050 there will be near parity between Muslims (2.8 billion, or 30 percent of the population) and Christians (2.9 billion, or 31 percent), possibly for the first time in history.\u201d (Pew explains that Muslims might have outnumbered Christians sometime between 1000 and 1600 as Muslim forces repeatedly invaded Christian strongholds and the Black Death decimated Europe. But we\u2019ll never know because estimates for the Middle Ages are \u201cfraught with uncertainty.\u201d)\n\nThe most significant response to Pew\u2019s report (.pdf file here) comes from another essential resource for journalists, the Center for the Study of Global Christianity at Gordon-Conwell Theological Seminary. That analysis tapped the annual CSGC survey for the International Bulletin of Missionary Research, which was expanded this time to include projections to 2050 (.pdf file here). This center, which the Religion Guy recently visited, provides statistics for various reference books and has just began work on a 3d edition of its World Christian Encyclopedia.\n\nAs of 2050, CSGC projects a slightly lower global count than Pew for Muslims at 2.7 billion, and a considerably higher 3.4 billion for Christians.\n\nWhy the disparity? Both agencies track established demographic censuses and surveys, but CSGC also considers statistics from religious denominations themselves. In addition, CSGC relies upon observers it has recruited in each nation to assess \u201cnon-traditional forms of Christianity\u201d that achieve \u201csome of the most significant growth of Christianity in the world today.\u201d This includes \u201chouse churches and insider movements (where individuals convert to Christianity in secret and/or remain identified with their past religion).\u201d\n\nChina and India are of particular importance. The center says that in nations like this that have \u201chigh governmental and/or social restrictions on religion,\u201d believers \u201coften do not report their true religious affiliation in order to avoid persecution.\u201d Thus, CSGC draws from \u201con-the-ground contacts\u201d who say Christianity is expanding through conversions and underground communities. Pew does not calculate religious switching in either nation, cautiously citing the lack of reliable data.\n\nPew figures by 2050 China will be 5.4 percent Christian and India 2.2 percent whereas the CSGC projects roughly triple that, 15.8 percent and 6.9 percent respectively, a difference of nearly a quarter-billion souls. CSGC \u201cconsistently finds more switching to Christianity in many African and Asian countries\u201d than Pew does. In 35 years we\u2019ll know whether Pew\u2019s standard demographic data or CSGC\u2019s added reliance on church insiders comes closer to the mark.\n\nHere are the CSGC current estimates by category: Christians (all kinds) 2.4 billion, Muslims 1.7 billion, Hindus 985 million, Buddhists 520 million, Chinese \u201cfolk religionists\u201d 454 million, \u201cethnoreligionists\u201d 260 million, \u201cnew religionists\u201d 65 million, Sikhs 25 million, Jews 14.5 million, and agnostic or atheistic \u201cnonreligionists\u201d 831 million.\n\nReporters note: Pew\u2019s director of religion research is respected former Washington Post religion writer Alan Cooperman (202\u2013419-4372); he or Pew\u2019s media staff can be e-mailed via www.pewresearch.org.
