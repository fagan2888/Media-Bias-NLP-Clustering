On Tuesday, Virginia Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli lost his race to become his state’s next governor to former Democratic National Committee Chair Terry McAuliffe. On Thursday, Cuccinelliformer chief political strategist Chris LaCivita blamed his candidate’s defeat on the government shutdown which prevented the campaign from focusing on the roll-out of the Affordable Care Act in early October.



“It moved the disaster of Obamacare away from our narrative,” LaCivita told National Review reporter Robert Costa. “It sucked the oxygen out of the room. Instead of talking about Obamacare, we were talking about the shutdown.”

“It was this perfect storm of events that hurt us,” LaCivita says. “We had been preparing to use the October 1 start of Obamacare as the center of our strategy, and then it was just taken off the table. Once the shutdown ended, we worked hard to maximize what we could.”

LaCivita avoided blaming the Republican Party’s committees or GOP “power brokers” for the Cuccinelli campaign’s loss.
