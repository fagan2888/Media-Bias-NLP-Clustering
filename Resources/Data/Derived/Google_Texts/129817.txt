No known use of the wrong drug, but prescribing, dispensing errors have been reported.

HealthDay News â€” Confusion between the names of the antidepressant Brintellix (vortioxetine) and the antiplatelet Brilinta (ticagrelor) has led to the wrong medication being prescribed or dispensed, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration says.

While none of the reports indicate that a patient has used the wrong medication, reports of prescribing and dispensing errors are still being received by the FDA.

Physicians can reduce the risk of name confusion by including the generic name of the medication on prescriptions in addition to the brand name, along with the indication for their use.

In a safety announcement, the FDA urges "patients and health care professionals to report name confusion and medication errors involving Brintellix and Brilinta to the FDA MedWatch program."
