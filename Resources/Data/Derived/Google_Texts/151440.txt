After this week’s shenanigans that saw President Obama and Republican House Speaker John Boehner both pushing for the same omnibus spending bill, conservatives are ready for a change in leadership.

The call for a new speaker of the GOP-led House is nothing new, but until now there has not been a formidable challenger. And not that he has concurred, but conservatives are rallying behind U.S. Rep. Trey Gowdy, who has proven time and again that he has plenty of fight in him.

Whether he’s question former IRS employee Lois Lerner, or Obamacare architect Jonathan Gruber, Gowdy has shown that he will “bring some BOOM into the ROOM,” as one social media user noted.

The tweet is part of a makeshift “Draft Gowdy for Speaker” campaign that has taken hold, as seen on Twitter:
