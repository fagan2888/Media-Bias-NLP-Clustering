Ted Cruz to keep it closed. It was Coffman\u2019s inability to stand up to the Tea Party from the outset that led us to this spot.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "DENVER -- Congressman Mike Coffman confirmed to FOX31 Denver that he will vote in favor of the Senate bill to end the government shutdown and raise the nation's debt ceiling when the legislation comes to the House floor Wednesday night.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "p": {"domain_verify": "5873d9988d745234e5abf9cff7ed939d"}, "og": {"site_name": "FOX31 Denver", "description": "DENVER \u2014 Congressman Mike Coffman confirmed to FOX31 Denver that he will vote in favor of the Senate bill to end the government shutdown and raise the nation\u2019s debt ceiling when the leg\u2026", "title": "Coffman will vote for Senate deal to end shutdown, avert default", "url": "http://kdvr.com/2013/10/16/coffman-will-vote-for-senate-deal-to-end-shutdown-avert-default/", "image": {"width": 400, "identifier": "https://localtvkdvr.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/coffmanoffice.jpg", "height": 225}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "https://localtvkdvr.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/coffmanoffice.jpg?w=240", "site": "@kdvr", "card": "summary", "creator": "@kdvr"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CC50DB4C5614EA88B5CFA75E33AAB02", "msapplication-tooltip": "Denver, Colorado News, Weather, Sports and more", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=334627011", "fb": {"pages": 90018331599}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://kdvr.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/17e52d5bd05a36821dc7d1d5f90e105c?s=16", "application-name": "FOX31 Denver", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/fox31denver", "published_time": "2013-10-16T22:49:36+00:00", "modified_time": "2013-10-16T22:49:36+00:00", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/fox31denver"}, "keywords": "politics,", "google-site-verification": "AmrqnQj74ngNWI1vn6WwMZyy9IWy4ZqooGuxLtd7lIs", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0d64\"", "article_summary": "\u00d7 Coffman will vote for Senate deal to end shutdown, avert defaultDENVER \u2014 Congressman Mike Coffman confirmed to FOX31 Denver that he will vote in favor of the Senate bill to end the government shutdown and raise the nation\u2019s debt ceiling when the legislation comes to the House floor Wednesday night.\n\u201cThis is merely a bridge,\u201d Coffman told FOX31 Denver Wednesday afternoon.\nCoffman, one of the most vulnerable members of Congress, is the first Colorado Republican to signal their support for the deal.\nOn Wednesday, Coffman said he reversed course when it was clear that Democrats weren\u2019t going to negotiate.\nHence, the steady barrage of press releases from Democratic groups bashing Coffman for his shifting positions and blaming him and his fellow Republicans for the shutdown."}
