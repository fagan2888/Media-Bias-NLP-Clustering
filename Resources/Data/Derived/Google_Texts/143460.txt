University of California-Irvine said today that Dr. Howard Federoff will be its new vice chancellor for health affairs and dean of the School of Medicine, effective July 1.

The vice chancellor for health affairs is a new position that includes oversight of UCI’s clinical, medical education, and research work. Federoff's duties here include working with UCI Chancellor Howard Gillman on finding a new chief executive for the UC Irvine Medical Center. Current chief Terry Belmont has said he plans to retire June 30.

As dean of the medical school Federoff replaces interim dean Dr. Roger Steinert, a professor of ophthalmology and director of the Gavin Herbert Eye Institute. Steinert replaced Dr. Ralph Clayman, who retired last July.

Federoff comes to UCI from Georgetown University in Washington, D.C., where he held a similar position to his new one. While there he was lead author of a 2014 study involving blood tests for Alzheimer’s disease.

“[Federoff] brings unique and exceptional abilities to this position,” Gillman said in a statement.

Federoff said he plans “to bring a fresh perspective” to leading UCI’s healthcare efforts.
