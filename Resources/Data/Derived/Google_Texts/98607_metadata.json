In this photo, Sen. Ted Cruz, center, accompanied by Sen. Marco Rubio, left, and Sen. Mike Lee, right, are pictured on Friday, Sept. 27, 2013, on Capitol Hill in Washington. (J. Scott Applewhite/AP)\n\nOn Sunday, I did that stupid thing I so often do: I clicked on a link to an inflammatory political interview. In this case, it was David Gregory talking to Senator Ted Cruz on \u201cMeet the Press\u201d about his campaign to de-fund the Affordable Care Act, sometimes called \u201cObamacare.\u201d\n\nWhen Gregory questioned whether Cruz was being intransigent, the Texan replied, \u201cIt is the Democrats who have taken the absolutist position.\u201d The absolutist position Cruz was referring to is that laws passed by Congress should be treated as, uh, laws.\n\nAs some of you may remember, the ACA \u2014 whose intent is to make health insurance more affordable and accessible \u2014 was signed into law in March of 2010. Earlier this year, the Supreme Court ruled it constitutional.\n\nOf course, there are ways to eliminate a law you don\u2019t like in this country. You can gather the votes to repeal it, for instance, or challenge it in court. Conservatives have failed at both approaches. So they are now in the \u201cshut down the government\u201d phase.\n\nIf you\u2019re like Ted Cruz, someone whose credibility depends on vilifying this law, the signs are not good.\n\nIf you step back from the situation for a sec, it\u2019s a pretty brazen precedent. What\u2019s next on the conservative repeal-or-we\u2019ll-shut-the-government-down list: the New Deal? Civil Rights? Freeing the slaves?\n\nBut here\u2019s the thing about Cruz and his brethren: they are in a genuine existential pickle. Because the modern conservative movement, in particular the Tea Party, is built around a single notion: that government is the problem, not the solution.\n\nThis is what every major conservative policy argument eventually boils down to: starve the government and let the private sector (or \u201cthe markets\u201d) solve the problem.\n\nIt\u2019s certainly true that Senator Cruz is using this issue to boost his profile for a 2016 presidential run. He is the current Republican front-runner. And it\u2019s also true that many House Republicans are supporting the shutdown effort out of a raw political fear that if they don\u2019t they will face a primary challenge next election.\n\nBut the ACA poses a far more fundamental threat to conservatives: it provides the American electorate definitive proof that the government can effect good on a mass scale. If the ACA becomes popular, it won\u2019t just humiliate conservatives, it will expose the fallacy at the heart of their dogma.\n\nThis is probably why Republicans talk so little about what the law actually does.\n\nHere\u2019s a short list:\n\nProvides free preventive care.\n\nAllows young adults to remain on their parents\u2019 insurance until age 26.\n\nForces insurance companies to enroll people even if they have a pre-existing condition.\n\nMakes it illegal for health insurance companies to arbitrarily cancel your policy because you get sick.\n\nThere\u2019s almost nobody who opposes these measures. Republicans support them by a huge majority when they\u2019re presented outside the context of Obamacare.\n\nIt\u2019s only when folks like Cruz start scaremongering \u2014 always in the most abstract of terms \u2014 that people turn against the ACA.\n\nLike any huge government program, Obamacare is not going to work perfectly for everyone. And there will no doubt be some folks who are hurt by the law. (Most, if not all, of them will eventually appear on Fox News to detail the horror. Count on it.)\n\nWhat\u2019s next on the conservative repeal-or-we\u2019ll-shut-the-government-down list: the New Deal? Civil Rights? Freeing the slaves?\n\nBut for the vast majority of Americans, Obamacare is going to be a great deal. More people will be insured. Fewer people will go bankrupt. The government will spend less money picking up the tab for the uninsured. The premiums for new policies offered by exchanges are proving much less expensive than critics expected.\n\nAnd I can speak here from personal experience. In the past two years, my wife and I have received two rebates from our insurance company, totaling more than $500, because the company doesn\u2019t spend enough of our premiums on improving care. We also got several hundred dollars worth of free preventative care.\n\nMillions of Americans \u2014 even those who hate Obamacare \u2014 have enjoyed similar savings.\n\nIf you\u2019re like Ted Cruz, someone whose credibility depends on vilifying this law, the signs are not good. So it makes perfect sense that he and his comrades would do anything \u2014 including sending our fragile economy into a free fall \u2014 to keep the ACA from proving its worth.\n\n\n\nRelated:", "article_metadata": {"description": "If the Affordable Care Act becomes popular, it won't just humiliate conservatives, it will expose the fallacy at the heart of their dogma.", "og": {"site_name": "cognoscenti", "description": "If the Affordable Care Act becomes popular, it won't just humiliate conservatives, it will expose the fallacy at the heart of their dogma.", "title": "The Real Reason Republicans Are Terrified Of Obamacare", "url": "http://cognoscenti.wbur.org/2013/10/01/government-shutdown-steve-almond", "image": "http://s3.amazonaws.com/media.wbur.org/wordpress/16/files/2013/09/1001_GOP_cog-592x323.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://cognoscenti.wbur.org/2013/10/01/government-shutdown-steve-almond", "image": "//s3.amazonaws.com/media.wbur.org/wordpress/16/files/2013/09/1001_GOP_cog-592x323.jpg", "site": "@cogwbur", "card": "summary", "title": "The Real Reason Republicans Are Terrified Of Obamacare"}, "DC.date.issued": "2013-10-01", "fb": {"admins": 1549080028, "app_id": 134067973330252}, "msvalidate.01": "D02D46BAEDB3F81FC1B1DE2A8CB69551"}, "article_summary": "In this photo, Sen.
