A capsule — and different — look at elected and public officials in Texas

Potter County

Human Resources Director

Kay Holland

■ The basics: 55 years old. One child. Amarillo native. Tascosa High School/Amarillo College alum. Has been in current position with the county since December of 2011. In addition, has been in various human resources positions since 1982.

■ Basic responsibilities of the job/position: “Generally speaking, I manage the human resources and parole functions for Potter County. This includes the group employee benefits.”

■ How many county employees are there in Potter County, roughly? “About 600.”

■ Favorite/least favorite part of the job: “My favorite part of the job is the people — that is what drew me to HR to begin with. This is a part of the job that I really enjoy. It is called ‘human’ resources (laughing.) My least favorite part is probably keeping up with all the rapidly changing laws and rules. The Affordable Care Act — oh, boy. That is the gift that keeps on giving (laughing.)”

■ Hobbies/spare time: “I like to hang out with my family. I spend a lot of time with my daughter and my mother.”

■ Guilty pleasure: “That would have to be coffee — coffee coupled with a good sunrise. Those are the best things in the world. I buy my coffee, but I also like to make it at home. It just depends. Just as long as it is good coffee, I like it.”
