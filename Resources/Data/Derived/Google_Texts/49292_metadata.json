Most assuredly lots of people will.\n\nI think the campaign itself wasn't leading with bold discussion of specific spending priorities for sensible strategic reasons. To some extent, the Paul campaign's pivots to libertarian-ish ideas are mostly in what I like to call the \"nice\" side of libertarianism\u2014the parts that involve getting the government to stop doing bad things.\n\nLike, say, spying on us, or messing up people's lives forever because they smoke pot, or like raw milk, or killing people by executive ukase, or taking a large chunk of our income in a complicated and confusing process, or, maybe, starting wars carelessly.\n\nBut when it comes to spending cuts every cent of the budget is someone's family's income, some service provided to someone, something that someone thinks is a good being provided to someone, for something. It has always been difficult to get people to agree they want that to happen in any specific case. The particulars of his vision of governmetn spending might be the hardest sell of all in Paul's run, and he's probably lucky not that much attention is being drawn to it.\n\nSee, for example, the headline Vox gave to a second article on Paul's spending priorities: \"Rand Paul wants the government to do much, much less for the poor.\"\n\nThat's tough to campaign on, especially if not rooted in consistently hardcore libertarian principles about the purpose of government and the richness of voluntarism.\n\nAs Vox notes, even for a Republican Paul is strangely serious about spending cuts:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "And the Problems With the Politics of Spending Cuts", "title": "The Seriousness of Rand Paul's Budget", "url": "http://reason.com/blog/2015/04/09/the-seriousness-of-rand-pauls-budget", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14286094686849.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14286094686849.jpg", "description": "And the Problems With the Politics of Spending Cuts", "site": "@reason", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "The Seriousness of Rand Paul's Budget"}, "fb": {"pages": 17548474116}, "article": {"tag": "Policy", "published_time": "2015-04-09T22:06:00+00:00", "author": "http://reason.com/people/brian-doherty"}, "msvalidate.01": "212A68A07785B3080038A845C4EE8905", "google-site-verification": "-AmMiilAN-pnjWt369CUWae-VQ-b9wmH4fSGyhbkQxw", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdaf36\"", "article_summary": "Here's Rand Paul's fiscal 2014 document.\nSee, for example, the headline Vox gave to a second article on Paul's spending priorities: \"Rand Paul wants the government to do much, much less for the poor.\"\nI think the campaign itself wasn't leading with bold discussion of specific spending priorities for sensible strategic reasons.\nAs Vox notes, even for a Republican Paul is strangely serious about spending cuts:\nGovernment Printing Office is eliminated (\"every government office and agency should budget for their own printing costs\")."}
