The effect has been to create a kind of private tax system, catering to only several thousand Americans.\u201d\n\nThe effects have been dramatic: \u201cTwo decades ago, when Bill Clinton was elected president, the 400 highest-earning taxpayers in America paid nearly 27 percent of their income in federal taxes, according to I.R.S. data. By 2012, when President Obama was re-elected, that figure had fallen to less than 17 percent, which is just slightly more than the typical family making $100,000 annually, when payroll taxes are included for both groups.\u201d\n\nWhen polls show the American mainstream support higher tax burdens on the very wealthy, the public\u2019s instincts on this are understandable.\n\nBut the Times\u2019 Josh Barro published a related item on New Year\u2019s Eve, noting that the trend changed direction, quite dramatically, in 2013 \u2013 and whether you think that\u2019s a positive or negative development, you can attribute the shift largely to President Obama.\n\nData released by the I.R.S. on Wednesday shows that tax rates on the income of America\u2019s 400 wealthiest taxpayers rose sharply to 22.9 percent in 2013, erasing a majority of the last two decades\u2019 decline in their effective tax rate. [\u2026] The spike in the wealthiest people\u2019s tax rates was mostly achieved \u2026 through initiatives from President Obama. Two laws that he championed became effective in 2013, raising tax rates on high earners and limiting the value of tax deductions they are entitled to take.\n\nThe two laws, of course, were the Affordable Care Act and the tax deal from late 2012 \u2013 remember the so-called \u201cfiscal cliff\u201d? \u2013 that raised taxes to Clinton-era levels on the very wealthy.\n\nWhy are billionaires so openly hostile towards the president that rescued the economy from the Great Recession? Because they were making out like bandits for the better part of a generation, and now they\u2019re not.\n\nPaul Krugman added yesterday, \u201cThe point, of course, was not to punish the rich but to raise money for progressive priorities, and while the 2013 tax hike wasn\u2019t gigantic, it was significant. Those higher rates on the 1 percent correspond to about $70 billion a year in revenue. This happens to be in the same ballpark as both food stamps and budget office estimates of this year\u2019s net outlays on Obamacare. So we\u2019re not talking about something trivial.\u201d\n\nAll of this is correct, of course, but let\u2019s go one step further and note what happened after these policies took effect. Remember, Republican supply-side Economics 101 tells us that when government \u201cpunishes job-creators\u201d with higher taxes, the economy suffers, job growth stalls, and investments end.\n\nAnd yet, none of this happened. The wealthy paid more for the first time in many years, and the detrimental effects on the economy were non-existent. On the contrary, job growth soared in 2014 in ways we haven\u2019t seen since the 1990s. We don\u2019t yet have all of the data for 2015, but it\u2019s on track to be nearly as good a year.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "description": "For the first time in nearly a generation, the wealthy face a higher tax burden -- and Republican Economics 101 isn't holding up well at all.", "original-source": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/obama-reverses-long-term-trend-wealthy-taxes", "og": {"site_name": "MSNBC", "description": "For the first time in nearly a generation, the wealthy face a higher tax burden -- and Republican Economics 101 isn't holding up well at all.", "title": "Obama reverses long-term trend on wealthy, taxes", "url": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/obama-reverses-long-term-trend-wealthy-taxes", "image": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--1_91-1--1200x630/public/obama.jpeg-05f0d.jpg?itok=lF1ukCRl", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "msnbc.com", "account_id": 2836421, "title": "Obama reverses long-term trend on wealthy, taxes", "url": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/obama-reverses-long-term-trend-wealthy-taxes", "image": {"width": 830, "identifier": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--3-2--512x342/public/obama.jpeg-05f0d.jpg?itok=Osjdf6r6", "height": 553}, "creator": {"identifier": "@msnbc", "id": 2836421}, "site": {"identifier": "@msnbc", "id": 2836421}, "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "For the first time in nearly a generation, the wealthy face a higher tax burden -- and Republican Economics 101 isn't holding up well at all."}, "robots": "follow, index", "DC.date.issued": "2016-01-05T11:20:14-05:00", "jenga-session-config": "{\"when_to_init\":\"after_dom_ready\"}", "fb": {"app_id": 351594351545594}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/steve.benen"}, "abstract": "For the first time in nearly a generation, the wealthy face a higher tax burden -- and Republican Economics 101 isn't holding up well at all.", "nv": {"tags": "barack-obama,economy,tax-policy,taxes,rachel-maddow-show", "author": "steve-benen", "published": 1, "date": "01/05/2016 11:20:14 EST", "title": "Obama reverses long-term trend on wealthy, taxes", "address": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/obama-reverses-long-term-trend-wealthy-taxes"}, "news_keywords": "Economy, Taxes, Barack Obama, Tax Policy"}, "article_summary": "Remember, Republican supply-side Economics 101 tells us that when government \u201cpunishes job-creators\u201d with higher taxes, the economy suffers, job growth stalls, and investments end.\nThose higher rates on the 1 percent correspond to about $70 billion a year in revenue.\n[\u2026] The spike in the wealthiest people\u2019s tax rates was mostly achieved \u2026 through initiatives from President Obama.\nTwo laws that he championed became effective in 2013, raising tax rates on high earners and limiting the value of tax deductions they are entitled to take.\nThe wealthy paid more for the first time in many years, and the detrimental effects on the economy were non-existent."}
