Data collected by the federal courts show that it now takes 63 percent longer for a civil case to get to trial. In 1993 it took 16 months; in 2013, 23 months. Numbers from the Eastern District fall in line with this trend. For the year ending September 2014, it took an average of 27 months from filing for a civil case to get to trial.\n\nBut there\u2019s another reason why the state\u2019s U.S. Senators should act with a sense of urgency to get the Eastern District vacancy filled and perhaps also seek another judgeship for that court: The number of judges there hasn\u2019t kept up with population growth in the region.\n\nAccording to population data analyzed by the Journal and charted in its print edition (subscription required for online), North Carolina\u2019s Eastern District is second only to California\u2019s Eastern District in terms of number of residents per judgeship.", "article_metadata": {"fb": {"pages": 71966175060}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://pulse.ncpolicywatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/cropped-logo_shadow-square-270x270.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdbc7f\"", "article_summary": "According to population data analyzed by the Journal and charted in its print edition (subscription required for online), North Carolina\u2019s Eastern District is second only to California\u2019s Eastern District in terms of number of residents per judgeship.\nThat\u2019s a topic Policy Watch has written about frequently \u2014 especially as it relates to North Carolina\u2019s Eastern District, where a judgeship has gone unfilled for close to ten years.\nNumbers from the Eastern District fall in line with this trend.\nData collected by the federal courts show that it now takes 63 percent longer for a civil case to get to trial.\nFor the year ending September 2014, it took an average of 27 months from filing for a civil case to get to trial."}
