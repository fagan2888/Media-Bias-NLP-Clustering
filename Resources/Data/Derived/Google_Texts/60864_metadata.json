(Charles Ommanney/The Washington Post)\n\nThe sixth-floor windows of the new Whitman-Walker Health center on 14th Street NW offer a million-dollar view of the Logan Circle neighborhood: tony rowhouses, rooftops of luxury condo buildings and the signs of upscale restaurants.\n\nInside, more than a third of the center\u2019s patients are at or below the poverty level.\n\nWhitman-Walker, the District\u2019s largest community-based provider of HIV services, cut the ribbon on its new health facility Thursday, between P and Q streets, a few blocks south of its longtime Elizabeth Taylor Medical Center headquarters at 14th and R streets NW.\n\nAlthough the move is mere blocks, it\u2019s also notable. The center is keeping with its mission of providing health care to underserved communities while remaining in an upscale corridor as other social-service agencies and longtime businesses are shuttering or moving east.\n\nFourteenth Street, emblematic of new wealth that has transformed parts of the District in recent years, was not so long ago known for prostitution and crime \u2014 and lined with establishments offering social services to the area\u2019s largely poor residents.\n\nWhitman-Walker Health opens its new clinic Thursday on 14th Street in Washington.

(Charles Ommanney/The Washington Post)\n\nMany of these agencies and businesses have cashed in on their valuable properties and left. The charity Martha\u2019s Table announced last month that it would move its longtime 14th Street headquarters to Southeast Washington, where many of its clients live.\n\n[In a changing D.C., a $20 million move]\n\nBut nonprofit Whitman-Walker, which now functions as a general health provider, says that the area is still one of the most accessible in the District and that it wants to stay in the historic heart of the city\u2019s gay community.\n\nWhen Whitman-Walker began in 1973, it served gay men exclusively. The center\u2019s clientele has shifted, and today, nearly 40 percent of its patients identify as heterosexual, according to 2014 data from Whitman-Walker.\n\nIts patients\u2019 homes are now spread throughout the District\u2019s wards. (Thirteen percent live in Ward 2, where its headquarters are located, and 12 percent live in Ward 8.) Whitman-Walker also has a smaller facility in Ward 8\u2019s Anacostia.\n\nStill, the organization owes much of its financial viability to the gay community, which is, in part, why it\u2019s committed to remaining in Logan Circle.\n\nWhen the AIDS epidemic struck the District, many of its clients, when they died, left their property and money to Whitman-Walker, which was at the forefront of fighting the disease in the city. At the time, Whitman-Walker used these homes as hospice centers, later renting or selling most of them in tough financial times.\n\nThe pharmacy at the new Whitman-Walker Health building. (Charles Ommanney/The Washington Post)\n\nIn 2008, Whitman-Walker sold a long-standing property it purchased at 14th and S streets NW that is now the trendy Doi Moi restaurant and the upscale cocktail bar 2 Birds 1 Stone.\n\n\u201cA big part of our mission is to serve this [gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender] community. It\u2019s a big part of our identity \u2014 that is, that people of that community feel affirmed and that they feel like they can come here for quality health care,\u201d said Don Blanchon, executive director of Whitman-Walker. \u201cWe\u2019re not that far removed from a period where people didn\u2019t feel like mainstream medicine cared about them and could treat them.\u201d\n\nThe architecture of the new building itself \u2014 which boasts modern furniture, a pharmacy on its ground floor, dental facilities, mental health and yoga spaces, and gender-neutral restrooms \u2014 represents how far health care has come for the city\u2019s LGBT residents.\n\nThe 42,000-square-foot building, nicknamed \u201c1525\u201d after its address, looks much like the area\u2019s new condo buildings, with their huge, glass windows \u2014 a sign that today\u2019s patients no longer feel the need to hide from the public eye, according to the clinic. With an expansive offering of services, people no longer know what services clients are seeking when entering the building.\n\n\u201cThis is a big step up; everything you need is right here,\u201d said Achim Howard, a 44-year-old HIV-positive transgender man who started receiving medical treatment from Whitman-Walker in 2006 when he lived in a homeless shelter. Howard now serves as a patient representative on the center\u2019s Board of Directors and receives medical and mental health services there. \u201cThey\u2019ve been my backbone.\u201d\n\nAlthough Whitman-Walker is not moving from the corridor, it\u2019s still hoping to cash in on its coveted real estate.\n\nThe health center, which signed a 10-year lease and paid $9.8 million in build-out costs for its new facilities, has no plans to sell its old property \u2014 a large slab of property that has the potential for 165,000-square-feet of development \u2014 where many of its administrative offices are now housed.\n\nInstead, Whitman-Walker entered a joint partnership with Rockville-based Streetscape Partners to develop the massive property. The clinic still holds majority ownership of the property.\n\nAndy Altman, who was the city\u2019s director of planning under then-Mayor A. Anthony Williams (D) and now is a principal at Streetscape Partners, said the plan is to convert the property to a mixed-use development. Whitman-Walker will maintain office space there, and the rest will probably be residential and retail space. Altman estimates the project will be completed in about five years.\n\n\u201cWe are going to try and provide some community- and neighborhood-oriented businesses,\u201d Altman said, adding that, although it\u2019s in the early-planning stages, they would consider subsidizing some rents for shop owners. \u201cThe first thing you need to do is really understand the place and understand the people in the community. What\u2019s missing and who\u2019s not being served?\u201d\n\nWith the District\u2019s growing population and the federal Affordable Care Act in place, officials at Whitman-Walker expect its clientele to grow. It could use the old location for future expansion.\n\n\u201cWhitman-Walker has been a vital link to health services for communities that are often overlooked by mainstream health providers,\u201d Mayor Muriel E. Bowser (D) said. \u201cI\u2019m happy they\u2019ve put their stakes here.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The nonprofit agency says the area is one of D.C.\u2019s most accessible and wants to stay in the gay community.", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "The nonprofit agency says the area is one of D.C.\u2019s most accessible and wants to stay in the gay community.", "title": "As others leave, Whitman-Walker moves to new home on 14th Street NW", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/as-others-leave-whitman-walker-moves-to-new-home-on-upscale-14th-street/2015/06/04/fd1e8924-0ac7-11e5-95fd-d580f1c5d44e_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2015/06/04/Others/Images/2015-06-04/ww11433438291.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "perrystein"}, "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "eomportal-uuid": "fd1e8924-0ac7-11e5-95fd-d580f1c5d44e"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf475\"", "article_summary": "Whitman-Walker Health, a longtime service provider for the AIDS and HIV community, opens its new clinic Thursday on 14th Street NW in Washington.\nWhitman-Walker Health opens its new clinic Thursday on 14th Street in Washington.\nThe charity Martha\u2019s Table announced last month that it would move its longtime 14th Street headquarters to Southeast Washington, where many of its clients live.\nHoward now serves as a patient representative on the center\u2019s Board of Directors and receives medical and mental health services there.\n(Charles Ommanney/The Washington Post)The sixth-floor windows of the new Whitman-Walker Health center on 14th Street NW offer a million-dollar view of the Logan Circle neighborhood: tony rowhouses, rooftops of luxury condo buildings and the signs of upscale restaurants."}
