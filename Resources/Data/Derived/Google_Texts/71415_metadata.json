No further action is required.\n\n(Qualifying health insurance coverage under most, but not all, types of health care coverage plans. Taxpayers can use the chart on the IRS website to find out if their insurance counts as qualifying coverage.)\n\nExemptions\n\nTaxpayers may be eligible to claim an exemption from the requirement to have coverage. Eligible taxpayers need to complete the new IRS Form 8965 and attach it to their tax return. Taxpayers must apply for some exemptions through the Health Insurance Marketplace, but most of the exemptions are obtained easily from the IRS when filing a return.\n\nIndividual Shared Responsibility Payment\n\nTaxpayers who do not have qualifying coverage or an exemption for each month of the year will need to make an individual shared responsibility payment with their return for choosing not to purchase coverage. Examples and information about figuring the payment are available on the IRS Calculating the Payment page.\n\nPremium Tax Payment\n\nTaxpayers who bought coverage through the Health Insurance Marketplace should receive Form 1095-A from the marketplace by early February. This form should be saved because it has important information needed to complete a tax return.\n\nIf Form 1095-A is not received by early February, contact the marketplace where coverage was purchased. Do not contact the IRS because IRS representatives will not have access to this information.\n\nTaxpayers who benefited from advance payments of the premium tax credit must file a federal income tax return. These taxpayers need to reconcile those advance payments with the amount of premium tax credit they're entitled to based on their actual income. As a result, some people may see a smaller or larger tax refund or tax liability than they were expecting. Use IRS Form 8962 to calculate the premium tax credit and reconcile the credit with any advance payments.\n\nStill have questions?\n\nClick here for more information on the Affordable Care Act and its impact on your 2014 tax return.\n\nRELATED: 2015 tax season dos and don'ts", "article_metadata": {"article_author": "Kelli Dugan", "medium": "news", "news_keywords": "Affordable Care Act, business", "title": "Find out how the Affordable Care Act will affect your 2014 tax return", "og": {"site_name": "AL.com", "description": "With the 2015 tax filing season slated to begin Tuesday, Jan. 20, the Internal Revenue Service addressed Thursday some of the ways the Affordable Care Act will impact filers preparing their 2014 returns.", "title": "Find out how the Affordable Care Act will affect your 2014 tax return", "url": "http://www.al.com/business/index.ssf/2015/01/find_out_how_the_affordable_ca.html", "image": "http://image.al.com/home/bama-media/width620/img/business_impact/photo/irs-logojpg-9009a3537a3ccef6.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "With the 2015 tax filing season slated to begin Tuesday, Jan. 20, the Internal Revenue Service addressed Thursday some of the ways the Affordable Care Act will impact filers preparing their 2014 returns.", "title": "Find out how the Affordable Care Act will affect your 2014 tax return", "image": "http://image.al.com/home/bama-media/width620/img/business_impact/photo/irs-logojpg-9009a3537a3ccef6.jpg", "creator": "@KelliMDugan98", "site": "@aldotcom", "card": "summary"}, "article_date_updated": "Thursday, January 15, 2015,  5:43 PM", "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "AL.com", "article": {"author": "http://"}, "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Thursday, January 15, 2015,  5:43 PM", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "Description": "With the 2015 tax filing season slated to begin Tuesday, Jan. 20, the Internal Revenue Service addressed Thursday some of the ways the Affordable Care Act will impact filers preparing their 2014 returns."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf137\"", "article_summary": "Click here for more information on the Affordable Care Act and its impact on your 2014 tax return.\n(Qualifying health insurance coverage under most, but not all, types of health care coverage plans.\nTaxpayers who benefited from advance payments of the premium tax credit must file a federal income tax return.\nMeanwhile, some moderate-income taxpayers may also qualify for financial assistance to help cover the cost of health insurance purchased through the Health Insurance Marketplace.\nEligible taxpayers need to complete the new IRS Form 8965 and attach it to their tax return."}
