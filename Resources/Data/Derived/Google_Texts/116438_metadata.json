Hawaii likes its employer mandate\n\nObamacare\u2019s requirement that large companies offer health insurance may be polarizing for much of the nation \u2014 but it had Hawaiians at Aloha.\n\nUnlike its 49 counterparts, Hawaii has been living with a strict employer mandate for nearly 40 years. And as businesses nationwide celebrate a one-year delay in the similar Obamacare requirement that they cover workers, supporters of Hawaii\u2019s law say theirs is proof that the rest of the country could adjust \u2014 and even learn to like it.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\u201cFor the most part, the business owners here want to take care of their employees. They\u2019ve embraced [the law],\u201d said Brian Fitzgerald, a spokesman for the Hawaii Health Connector, the state health insurance exchange being set up to expand coverage under Obamacare.\n\nThat\u2019s been the case in Massachusetts, too, which introduced a gentler version of the employer mandate and an individual mandate in 2007. Both have been broadly accepted.\n\nIn Hawaii, there\u2019s no momentum to repeal the state rule, even among those Republicans who are skeptical. State Senate Minority Leader Sam Slom says he\u2019s introduced repeal bills that have been nonstarters even within his own caucus.\n\n( PHOTOS: 25 unforgettable Obamacare quotes)\n\n\u201cI hardly get any support for them either inside the Legislature or outside of it,\u201d he told POLITICO. Slom said businesses are less concerned about the coverage requirement than the slew of specific state-required benefits, which he says are more generous than the essential benefits in Obamacare.\n\nState Sen. Josh Green, a Democrat and physician who chairs the Senate Health Committee, agrees that the employer mandate, formally known as the Prepaid Health Care Act, has become an accepted part of the state\u2019s health care system and is, for the most part, taken for granted.\n\n\u201cThere is almost no mention of the Prepaid Health Care Act here among anyone,\u201d he said.\n\nHawaiian officials say it\u2019s no small irony that the 1974 Hawaii law was made possible by President Richard Nixon, who that year also signed the Employee Retirement Income Security Act \u2013 which included a series of restrictions on employer-based health care. That law, which some initially thought would preempt Hawaii\u2019s plan, also provided the opportunity for a waiver, which Hawaii obtained several years later, after litigation.\n\nSome supporters say it\u2019s that exemption itself that has helped preserve the law all these years. It requires that the state keep the law as is \u2014 or risk losing it altogether.\n\nWhen President Barack Obama pushed the Affordable Care Act through Congress, Hawaii was a little worried, so the state\u2019s then-senators, Daniel Akaka and Daniel Inouye, helped get language in to preserve the stricter state mandate.\n\n( Also on POLITICO: TOP 5 complaints about Obamacare)\n\nIn Hawaii, employers of any size must offer coverage to anyone working more than 19 hours per week, and the coverage can\u2019t cost more than 1.5 percent of a worker\u2019s income. Companies that fail to offer enough insurance can see various permits held up or face administrative fines.\n\nThe federal mandate, on the other hand, applies to businesses with more than 50 full-time employees, with full time defined as 30 hours per week. Affordable coverage is defined much more loosely as 9.5 percent of income.\n\nSlom, an economist who weighed in on the state law when it was being drawn up, said Hawaii was well-placed to experiment with an employer mandate because it had a historically high rate of insurance \u2014 about 90 percent when the law passed in 1974. The mandate helped bring up the insurance rate to 98 percent, although it slipped back to about 90 percent during the recession.\n\nOnly Massachusetts has matched that rate of coverage.\n\nMario Ramil, who was commissioner of Hawaii\u2019s insurance department in the 1980s, said he hopes the nation takes a cue from the Aloha State.\n\n\u201cI think that Hawaii\u2019s experience should serve as something to look to in determining a model for the nation,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s 40 years since we\u2019ve had it, and in that 40 years, we have the lowest uninsured rate. We have a very healthy population.\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t always a no-brainer. Ramil said that in 1977, Standard Oil filed a lawsuit over the law. Eventually the state sought and ultimately won an exemption from ERISA to protect it from further challenges.\n\nThere is some concern about how Obamacare will play out in the state. Green, the Democratic state senator, said many of the state\u2019s 90,000 uninsured are young and healthy \u2014 and unlikely to sign up for insurance under Obamacare, despite the fine they\u2019ll face.\n\n\u201cI think that many of these individuals will not see becoming insured as a benefit that outweighs the penalties, and therefore will not engage,\u201d he said in an email. \u201cAs a physician, I would have preferred an approach [in the ACA] that focused more on access to services rather than access to coverage, which will be of minimal benefit if there aren\u2019t more doctors and nurses to care for patients.\u201d\n\nCORRECTION: An earlier version of this story incorrectly described the timing of an exemption Hawaii was granted to preserve its employer mandate legislation.
