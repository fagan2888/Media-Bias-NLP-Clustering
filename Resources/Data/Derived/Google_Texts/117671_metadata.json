Maybe he would swallow once to further make his point.\n\nThis portrait of fleeting disquiet could be understood, and identified with, by every member of the audience. Never mind Garner was tall, brawny and, well, movie-star handsome. The persona he perfected was never less than manly, good with his dukes and charming to the ladies, but his heroics were kept human-scale thanks to his gift for the comic turn. He was one of the people.\n\nHe burst on the scene with this disarming style in the 1950s TV Western \u201cMaverick,\u201d which led to a stellar career in TV and films such as \u201cThe Rockford Files\u201d and his Oscar-nominated \u201cMurphy\u2019s Romance.\u201d\n\nThe 86-year-old Garner, who was found dead of natural causes at his Los Angeles home on Saturday, was adept at drama and action. But he was best known for his low-key, wisecracking style, especially on his hit TV series, \u201cMaverick\u201d and \u201cThe Rockford Files.\u201d\n\nHis quick-witted avoidance of conflict offered a refreshing new take on the American hero, contrasting with the blunt toughness of John Wayne and the laconic trigger-happiness of Clint Eastwood.\n\nThere\u2019s no better display of Garner\u2019s everyman majesty than the NBC series \u201cThe Rockford Files\u201d (1974-80). He played an L.A. private eye and wrongly incarcerated ex-con who seemed to rarely get paid, or even get thanks, for the cases he took, while helplessly getting drawn into trouble to help someone who was neither a client nor maybe even a friend. He lived in a trailer with an answering machine that, in the show\u2019s opening titles, always took a message that had nothing to do with a paying job, but more often was a complaining call from a cranky creditor.\n\nThrough it all, Jim Rockford, however down on his luck, persevered hopefully. He wore the veneer of a cynic, but led with his heart. Putting all that on screen was Garner\u2019s magic.\n\nWell into his 70s, the handsome Oklahoman remained active in both TV and film. In 2002, he was Sandra Bullock\u2019s father in the film \u201cDivine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood.\u201d The following year, he joined the cast of \u201c8 Simple Rules \u2026 For Dating My Teenage Daughter,\u201d playing the grandfather on the sitcom \u2014 and helping ground it with his reassuring presence \u2014 after star John Ritter, who played the father, died during the show\u2019s second season.\n\nHe even scored in commercials. During the late 1970s, he was paired with actress Mariette Hartley in a popular series of ads for Polaroid cameras. Their on-screen banter felt so authentic that many viewers mistakenly believed they were husband and wife.\n\nWhen Garner received the Screen Actors Guild\u2019s lifetime achievement award in 2005, he quipped, \u201cI\u2019m not at all sure how I got here.\u201d But in his 2011 memoir, \u201cThe Garner Files,\u201d he provided some amusing and enlightening clues, including his penchant for bluntly expressed opinions and a practice for decking people who said something nasty to his face \u2014 including an obnoxious fan and an abusive stepmother.\n\nAnd when he suspected his studio of cheating him on residual payments \u2014 a not-unheard-of condition in Hollywood \u2014 Garner spoke out loudly and fought back with lawsuits.\n\nThey all deserved it, Garner declared in his book.\n\nIt was in 1957 when the ABC network, desperate to compete on ratings-rich Sunday night, scheduled \u201cMaverick\u201d against CBS\u2019s powerhouse \u201cThe Ed Sullivan Show\u201d and NBC\u2019s \u201cThe Steve Allen Show.\u201d To everyone\u2019s surprise \u2014 except Garner\u2019s\u2014 \u201cMaverick\u201d soon outpolled them both.\n\nAt a time when the networks were awash with hard-eyed, traditional Western heroes, Bret Maverick provided a breath of fresh air. With his sardonic tone and his eagerness to talk his way out of a squabble rather than pull out his six-shooter, the con-artist Westerner seemed to scoff at the genre\u2019s values.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Film, TV legend James Garner, reluctant hero, dies", "author": "Frazier Moore", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Film, TV legend James Garner, reluctant hero, dies", "title": "Film, TV legend James Garner, reluctant hero, dies", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/07/20/film_tv_legend_james_garner_reluctant_hero_dies/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/07/james-garner-obit.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Film, TV legend James Garner, reluctant hero, dies", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/07/james-garner-obit.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "title": "Film, TV legend James Garner, reluctant hero, dies", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Film, TV legend James Garner, reluctant hero, dies", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0288\"", "article_summary": "James Garner had a way of widening his eyes while the corner of his mouth sagged ever so slightly.\nThere\u2019s no better display of Garner\u2019s everyman majesty than the NBC series \u201cThe Rockford Files\u201d (1974-80).\nAt a time when the networks were awash with hard-eyed, traditional Western heroes, Bret Maverick provided a breath of fresh air.\nWell into his 70s, the handsome Oklahoman remained active in both TV and film.\nTopics: From the Wires, Entertainment News, NewsNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Few actors could register disbelief, exasperation or annoyance with more comic subtlety."}
