In the Democratic Party debate following her drubbing in New Hampshire, Clinton repeatedly praised Obama\u2019s economic and foreign policy record. For purposes of this campaign, she has cast herself as the president\u2019s political heir now running for his third term.\n\nCommon sense tells us that this is not what she wanted to do. Leaving aside Bill and Hillary\u2019s personal antipathy for the interloper who sidetracked her 2008 campaign, the Clintons also know that grabbing hold of a deeply divisive president with weak approval ratings does not place her in the best position for what should be a very competitive general election.\n\nYet Mrs. Clinton\u2019s adulation must be music to Obama\u2019s ears. He\u2019s been, let us just stipulate, unduly attentive to his own presidential legacy from Day One. The question then has become: what can the president do to help elect Hillary Clinton? Besides ensuring that his Justice Department doesn\u2019t indict her\u2014no small issue\u2014history tells us his influence is limited.\n\nIncumbent presidents always want their party to hold the White House, but it\u2019s difficult to accomplish. Since the beginning of the 20th century, only Theodore Roosevelt, Calvin Coolidge and Ronald Reagan have seen their party\u2019s nominee elected at the end of their terms. In recent memory, two-term presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush saw the opposition party regain the White House. Winning three times in a row is tough. It will be again this time.\n\nAfter eight years, the public is generally looking for something different. Obama\u2019s poll numbers haven\u2019t been great these last couple of years. His job approval rating in the RealClearPolitics poll average is currently 46 percent. Fifty percent disapprove. These numbers are nothing to brag about, but they probably bolster support for Clinton, especially among blacks and Hispanics. But to win in November, Hillary (or Bernie Sanders) will have to draw support from a segment of the public that has an unfavorable view of the current administration, namely independents. This is going to be difficult\u2014and there\u2019s little the president can do to help.\n\nFor someone who has been so conscious of how he\u2019ll be perceived in the history books, Obama\u2019s accomplishments are tenuous. Economic growth has been tepid during most of his presidency and seems to be stalling again. His signature domestic policy achievement, the Affordable Care Act, was passed under false promises on a straight party-line vote, and remains unpopular six years after enactment as higher premium costs, narrow provider networks, and cancellation of previous policies continue to roil the insurance markets. Most of the rest of Obama\u2019s legacy consists of executive orders (climate change, lifting sanctions on Iran) that are also unpopular and could be reversed unilaterally by the next president.\n\nThe sour public mood extends beyond the Obama administration and Congress\u2014and Washington. Americans believe the country is headed in the wrong direction by nearly a three-to-one margin, which tilts the political environment strongly against the incumbent party. This election is the GOP\u2019s to lose. The public is prepared to hear another narrative about how American optimism can be restored and the economy healed, and it is up to the GOP candidates to make that case. But the public is clearly receptive to that pitch: polls show that every Republican still in the presidential race is competitive when put in a mock matchup against Hillary Clinton.\n\nThe last president who really helped his party\u2019s nominee was Ronald Reagan. The Gipper campaigned long and hard for his vice president and successor, George H.W. Bush. Reagan was riding record popularity in 1988, and Bush was the beneficiary. Reagan\u2019s record in restoring the economy, lowering taxes, beginning the process of reforming welfare, and rebuilding American military strength while striking arms control pacts with the Soviet Union was heartily endorsed by the American public.\n\nReagan and Bush campaigned across the country trumpeting American economic dynamism, a Soviet empire in decline, and restoration of American pride and respect in the world.
