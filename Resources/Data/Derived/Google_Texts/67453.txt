This week, the US non-citizens can start making appointments with Colorado's Division of Motor Vehicles (DMV) to get a driver's license through the Colorado Road and Community Safety Act.

The mentioned Act underscores a program under which US non-citizens - that is, people who cannot demonstrate lawful presence in the US or those who can only demonstrate temporary lawful presence in the country - can apply for a Colorado driver's license, instruction permit or identification card.

Though the roll out of the program - by appointment only - has been scheduled for August 1, people can now start making appointments with the DMV in Colorado. Already, more than 830 people have scheduled appointments in Colorado to get driver's license. The program will be rolled by at only five offices statewide, including Denver, Aurora, Fort Collins, Colorado Springs and Grand Junction.

The non-citizens have showed such overwhelming interest in the program that the average number of hourly hits on the 'Schedule an Appointment at a Driver's License Office' page on Tuesday was 70,000, including a high of as many as 107,500 hits hourly. The page generally averages 8,126 hits per hour.

Due to the immense interest, the website for Colorado's DMV was briefly shut down late Wednesday; though it was back online by 5 a. m. Thursday local time.
