Is the more expensive mammogram \u201cbetter\u201d than the cheaper one? /iStockphoto.com\n\nLast week, we asked our audience a question: What did your mammogram cost?\n\nAs part of Price Check \u2013 our collaboration with KQED in San Francisco and ClearHealthCosts.com \u2013 we\u2019re collecting this data for the next month. The goal is to bring transparency to health costs in California, and help inform the policy debate over how to hold down these costs.\n\nIf you need a little more incentive to add your information to our database, consider this:\n\nBefore we launched this project, staff from ClearHealthCosts.com surveyed California medical centers. They found that in the Los Angeles area, the self-pay (or cash) price for a mammogram could range from $60 at H. Claude Hudson Comprehensive Health Center, to $254 at Westchester Imaging Medical Center.\n\nMeanwhile, an audience member shared her costs: She said her Kaiser Permanente insurance paid $694 for a mammogram.\n\nWhy such a large variation? And is there any difference in the quality of these mammograms? Is the more expensive mammogram \"better\" than the cheaper one?\n\nI can\u2019t answer those questions, based on the numbers alone. But if you add your own costs, we might start to see some patterns.\n\nSpeaking of patterns: Lisa Aliferis - of KQED's State of Health blog, and a collaborator on this project - wrote this week about some early Price Check findings, based on the data we've collected from San Francisco:\n\nThese early data demonstrate that there\u2019s tremendous cost variation \u2014 especially on self-pay prices \u2014 on screening mammograms in the Bay Area. While cost variation is well known in American medicine, there aren\u2019t a lot of places consumers can go to see prices laid out in front of them. If you\u2019re not insured or if you want to go out-of-network for a screening mammogram, these data, though not comprehensive, at least give you a starting point on price.\n\nWant to get involved? Here\u2019s how to play: Grab your medical bill, visit Price Check, and tell us how much your mammogram cost.\n\nSide note\n\nSome of you have asked why we\u2019re focusing on mammograms, pointing out that they should be covered as preventive care under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nWe chose mammograms because when ClearHealthCosts.com did a pilot version of this project with New York NPR affiliate WNYC in the spring of 2013, they found that up to 30 percent of respondents paid for their mammograms.\n\nThere were several reasons why: They chose an out-of-network provider; they weren\u2019t insured; their insurer said they hadn\u2019t met their deductible; or it just wasn\u2019t covered.\n\nFor more on why some women are still paying for their mammograms, check out this great blog post from ClearHealthCosts.com. Check out this fact sheet from the National Women's Law Center for more information about how women's preventative services are covered under the federal health law.\n\nDo you have a story about the surprising costs of health procedures?
