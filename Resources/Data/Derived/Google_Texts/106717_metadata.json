The poll has a 2.8 percent margin of error.\n\n\u201cFor sure, national security and the economy are at the top of the list for conservative voters to date, and the GOP presidential candidates and the media are responding to those concerns,\u201d said Deneen Borelli, chief political correspondent for the Conservative Review website. \u201cAs the field whittles down, education will become an important issue to distinguish the candidates, especially as it relates to Common Core.\u201d\n\n\u2018A State and Local Issue\u2019\n\nImproving K\u201312 education ranks fourth on the list of voter concerns, according to the poll. The top three priorities are improving the economy and creating jobs (90 percent); reducing the national debt (76 percent); and holding down national spending (75 percent). Other issues most voters identified as important include reforming Social Security and Medicare (67 percent); fixing immigration and border security (66 percent); fixing the Affordable Care Act (64 percent); improving higher education (61 percent); and cutting federal taxes (56 percent).\n\nKansas Policy Institute President Dave Trabert says the 36 percent of polled voters who said they have not heard candidates discuss education policy could be due to Republican contenders\u2019 belief education should remain an issue states and local governments are responsible for.\n\n\u201cEducation shouldn\u2019t be an issue for candidates for national office,\u201d Trabert said. \u201cConsidering the dismal performances of students educated under such federal programs as Common Core and No Child Left Behind, the last thing we need is another top-down, national education initiative.\u201d\n\nWilliam Mattox, director of the Center for Educational Options at the James Madison Institute, says some presidential candidates have highlighted education policy.\n\n\u201cFormer Florida Gov. Jeb Bush has pointed to his remarkable success in pioneering school choice programs as evidence that \u2018Jeb can fix it,\u2019\u201d said Mattox. \u201cAnd prior to his departure from the race, Gov. Bobby Jindal sought to build GOP grassroots support by citing his impressive record promoting school choice and course access in Louisiana. Still, given the understandable wariness that most Republican primary voters have about the federal government\u2019s role in education, it\u2019s not altogether surprising that other issues have had greater salience in the 2016 GOP presidential nominee race up to now.\n\n\u201cPersonally, I\u2019d welcome a little more attention to presidential candidates\u2019 views on education policy,\u201d Mattox said. \u201cWith a recent Friedman Foundation poll showing that Hispanic voters care more about expanding educational options than they do about immigration, it\u2019d be nice to see more presidential candidates using their bully pulpit to promote school choice.\u201d\n\nStrong Support for ESAs, Vouchers\n\nKyle Olson, president the Education Action Group, says the federal government\u2019s role in education should be minimal. Olson notes a poll conducted in summer 2015 by the Friedman Foundation for Educational Choice concluded education is the second issue of importance listed by school parents surveyed. Olson says the number one issue is improving the economy and jobs.\n\n\u201cLess than half of the Friedman survey respondents replied they thought K\u201312 education in the United States was on the right track,\u201d Olson said. \u201cOnly 39 percent said they\u2019re optimistic about how our nation educates its children.\n\n\u201cAmong Republicans, 68 percent said they\u2019re unhappy with our country\u2019s public education; 67 percent favored education savings accounts; and 63 percent indicated they strongly support vouchers,\u201d said Olson.\n\nBruce Edward Walker (walker.editorial@gmail.com) is a policy analyst for The Heartland Institute.\n\nImage by Michael Vadon.\n\nInternet Info:\n\nCarolyn Phenicie, \u201cNew Poll Shows Majority of Voters List Schools As Big 2016 Issue, But 2/3 Haven\u2019t Heard Peep From Politicians,\u201d The Seventy Four, November 11, 2015: https://www.the74million.org/article/new-poll-most-voters-see-schools-as-top-election-issue-but-two-thirds-say-candidates-arent-discussing", "article_metadata": {}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0c5c\"", "article_summary": "\u201cPersonally, I\u2019d welcome a little more attention to presidential candidates\u2019 views on education policy,\u201d Mattox said.\nSixty-eight percent of voters surveyed reported education is a more important policy issue than immigration or health care, and only 36 percent said they have heard the current field of presidential candidates discuss education policy.\n\u201cEducation shouldn\u2019t be an issue for candidates for national office,\u201d Trabert said.\nRecent polling conducted by Public Opinion Strategies indicates most registered voters in U.S. swing states think education should be a top priority for the next president.\nOlson notes a poll conducted in summer 2015 by the Friedman Foundation for Educational Choice concluded education is the second issue of importance listed by school parents surveyed."}
