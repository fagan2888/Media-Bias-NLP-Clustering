You can\u2019t just make things up and proclaim them to be true, like you\u2019re living in Oz or Hogwarts or somewhere.\n\nAuthor Steven Brill, whom we last wrote about here, is running around the country pushing his recent book on health care, called \u201cAmerica's Bitter Pill: Money, Politics, Backroom Deals, and the Fight to Fix Our Broken Healthcare System.\u201d Every time he speaks, like last week before Detroit business leaders, he throws in this hot potato: \u201cDemocrats resistance to \u2018sensible Tort reform\u2019\u201d is a major reason why we have out of control health care costs. He never explains why he believes stripping injured patients of their legal rights will solve this problem. Apparently, nor does his book. As pointed out in the Sunday New York Times book review of \u201cAmerica\u2019s Bitter Pill\u201d: \u201cHe brushes over some contentious issues, making a casual assumption that tort reform would keep medical costs down. (Texas has tort reform, but there is no evidence to show it has kept costs from escalating.)\u201d That\u2019s an understatement.\n\nAllow me to assist. Those who say this kind of thing make two arguments. One, if a state doesn\u2019t strictly limit compensation to people whom health care providers have killed or maimed, doctors will order too many unnecessary tests for the sole reason that they might otherwise be sued. Two, that if a state doesn\u2019t strictly limit compensation in this way, med mal insurance companies will have no choice but to raise rates on doctors. And what are these major cost savings from enacting \u201ctort reform\u201d? According to the Congressional Budget Office in 2009, a whopping 0.3% in \u201cdefensive medicine\u201d costs and 0.2% in med mal insurance cost. That\u2019s it.\n\nBut even those paltry figures are exaggerations. I hope when Mr. Brill is sitting around some airport during his travels, he picks up the new edition of the New Yorker magazine. There he will find a new article from surgeon and public-health researcher, Dr. Atul Gawande, called \u201cOverkill: An avalanche of unnecessary medical care is harming patients physically and financially. What can we do about it?\u201d Nowhere in Dr.Gawande\u2019s article does he even mention a state\u2019s liability laws when it comes to evaluating health care costs.\n\nInstead, he found that \u201covertesting \u2026 is a by-product of all the new technologies we have for peering into the human body.\u201d He explains:\n\nOur ever more sensitive technologies turn up more and more abnormalities\u2014cancers, clogged arteries, damaged-looking knees and backs\u2014that aren\u2019t actually causing problems and never will. And then we doctors try to fix them, even though the result is often more harm than good. The forces that have led to a global epidemic of overtesting, overdiagnosis, and overtreatment are easy to grasp. Doctors get paid for doing more, not less. We\u2019re more afraid of doing too little than of doing too much. And patients often feel the same way. They\u2019re likely to be grateful for the extra test done in the name of \u201cbeing thorough\u201d\u2014and then for the procedure to address what\u2019s found.\n\nHe ends by saying: \u201cAn entire health-care system has been devoted to this game. Yet we\u2019re finally seeing evidence that the system can change\u2014even in the most expensive places for health care in the country.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s referring, of course, to McAllen, Texas. McAllen was the subject of Dr. Gawande\u2019s 2009 seminal, widely-read and influential New Yorker article called \"The Cost Conundrum; What a Texas town can teach us about health care.\" There he explored why the town of McAllen, Texas, \"was the country's most expensive place for health care.\" This was especially true when compared to neighboring Texas towns.\n\nIn his new article, Dr. Gawande went back to McAllen and found something extraordinary: since passage of the Affordable Care Act, the entire medical culture in McAllen had changed resulting in huge health care cost savings. He writes:\n\nMost startling of all, McAllen has been changing its ways. Between 2009 and 2012, its costs dropped almost three thousand dollars per Medicare recipient. [Economist Jonathan Skinner, of the Dartmouth Institute for Health Policy and Clinical Practice] projects the total savings to taxpayers to have reached almost half a billion dollars by the end of 2014. The hope of reform had been to simply \u201cbend the curve.\u201d This was savings on an unprecedented scale.\n\nDr. Gawande interviewed a number of McAllen doctors and all confirmed the same thing: the culture of McAllen doctors ordering excessive expensive tests and procedures had ended. Clearly, some federal fraud prosecutions against health care providers in McAllen may have also helped. But not one doctor mentioned Texas \u201ctort reform\u201d as having anything to do with it. In fact, Dr. Gawande put a decisive end to that theory back in 2009, reporting this exchange with a group of doctors:\n\n\"It's malpractice,\" a family physician who had practiced here for thirty-three years said. \"McAllen is legal hell,\" the cardiologist agreed. Doctors order unnecessary tests just to protect themselves, he said. Everyone thought the lawyers here were worse than elsewhere. That explanation puzzled me. Several years ago, Texas passed a tough malpractice law that capped pain-and-suffering awards at two hundred and fifty thousand dollars. Didn't lawsuits go down? \"Practically to zero,\" the cardiologist admitted. \"Come on,\" the general surgeon finally said. \u201cWe all know these arguments are bullshit. There is overutilization here, pure and simple.\u201d Doctors, he said, were racking up charges with extra tests, services, and procedures.\n\nDr. Gawande makes no mention of it again. Indeed, since that first article, a virtual consensus has built in the academic literature that \u201ctort reform\u201d does nothing to lower health care costs. In fact, it raises them.\n\nOK then, what about insurance rates for doctors? Aren\u2019t they going up and up? I raise this only for the purpose of quickly dismissing it. We have been in a \u201csoft\u201d insurance market since 2006. That means medical malpractice rates for doctors have been stable or dropping for almost a decade now. And don\u2019t just take my word for it.\n\nOn Friday, A.M. Best released a new report, along with a webinar about \u201cthe current state of the market for medical professional liability insurance\u201d with industry insiders. All agreed that the soft market continues and won\u2019t be ending anytime soon. And even though rates are low, the med mal insurance industry is now in the 9th consecutive year underwriting profit. Writes Best:\n\nThe companies that specialize in medical professional liability (MPL) insurance achieved an overall underwriting profit for a ninth consecutive year in 2014, according to a new special report by A.M. Best. The Best's Special Report, titled, \"Medical Professional Liability Segment Produces Ninth Straight Year of Underwriting Profit,\" also finds that 2014 represented another year since 2003 of positive net income and the 11th year out of the last 12 of positive surplus growth (the outlier being 2008 due to the financial market collapse).\n\nThis is grotesque. Insurers do not even expect to have an underwriting profit. The Americans for Insurance Reform 2011 study, Repeat Offenders, showed that the property/casualty insurance industry had an underwriting profit only 7 times in 44 years. Brian K. Atchinson, President & CEO of the Physicians Insurance Association of America called the state of the industry \u201chistoric\u201d and undeprecdented, going \u201cback 50 years.\u201d How nice for them.\n\nTo sum up the insurance situation, this industry is rolling in dough and doctors\u2019 insurance rates are stable and dropping. There\u2019s clearly not a problem to solve here let alone one involving stripping injured patients of their rights.\n\nGround control to Steven Brill?", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "ThePopTort", "description": "When discussing important issues like the cost of health care, it\u2019s important to focus one\u2019s attention on the Earth plain, wouldn\u2019t you agree?
