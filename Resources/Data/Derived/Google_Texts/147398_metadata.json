Unsurprisingly to those of us outside of the Washington Beltway, the reason given was simply the ever-mounting and uncontrolled costs of operating under the President\u2019s signature healthcare law.\n\nEach of us is in the middle of yet another year of rising monthly health insurance bills. Each of us has watched as the cost of every-day healthcare items at CVS, Target and even Walmart continue to rise.\n\nAs the economic policies of President Obama continue to cause us to pay higher bills with the same paycheck we\u2019ve had for years, it is terrifying to think how some Members of Congress just don\u2019t get it.\n\nLast month, Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-Louisiana), decided we weren\u2019t paying enough for contact lenses. As unbelievable as that sounds, that\u2019s exactly what he thought. The \u201cPay more for your contact lenses\u201d Act doesn\u2019t directly force us to pay more for our lenses, it merely makes it very hard for anyone to obtain new contact lenses anywhere but directly from their optometrist.\n\nUnder the guise of \u201cprotecting us from ourselves\u201d, Sen. Cassidy believes there is a need for further expansion of the Nanny State, Big Government, ObamaCare-type programs. He is somehow unsatisfied with the decades long practice of allowing consumers like us to go to any optometrist for a checkup and allowing us to take our prescription to anywhere we prefer to buy our lenses. Instead, Senator Cassidy believes it is necessary to create an unnecessary, and unneeded system which would force any company provided lenses to double-check that the order complies with the prescription.\n\nAs I had to recently go through the joy of having my eyesight checked and my prescription changed, I know how difficult it is for a patient to obtain our own prescription from an optometrist. But I know that it\u2019s been more than THIRTY YEARS since the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) decided patients have a right to have a copy of their own prescription.\n\nIf Sen. Cassidy was truly focused on \u201csafety for our eyesight\u201d we might acknowledge his good intentions, but just like the famous road paved with good intentions, this policy proposal is either a solution in search of a problem, or more likely another example of \u201ccrony capitalism\u201d. The senator somehow misses that this important point about consumer safety was settled 3 decades ago.\n\nSadly, it seems the only purpose of the legislation is to create a protectionist system to force us to buy our lenses from the same office that gives us our prescription. Look, it\u2019s easily understandable why independent optometrists would attempt to slow the verification process to another company that just sells contact lenses. The expansion of ObamaCare has made it hard on every small business across the US. But why would an elected senator actually attempt to change the law and create such an unwieldy and old school system?\n\nLuckily, when I read about this poorly-informed legislation, I came across an easy solution. Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) is standing up for the American people over Washington cronies. As Chairman of the Senate Judiciary\u2019s Subcommittee on Antitrust, Competition Policy and Consumer Rights, Senator Lee wrote a letter to the FTC telling them to enforce their own 30-year-old ruling and make certain optometrists are following the existing law.\n\nI\u2019m glad that Sen. Lee is standing up for consumers like me. I\u2019m glad he is taking the logical and easy path to do the right thing. I don\u2019t know anyone in America that is willing to pay more for healthcare than they are already being forced to.\n\nPerhaps Sen. Cassidy should take a lesson from Sen. Lee. Common Sense solutions often work best. I know an easy solution that will readily follow existing law and guarantee consumer health and protection.\n\nOptometrists should simply print a clear prescription for us and automatically include it in the paperwork we receive after our office visit. Eliminating a doctor\u2019s handwritten prescription would go much farther to protecting us all \u2013 whether contact lenses, eyeglasses or any other medical prescription.", "article_metadata": {"description": "It is often stunning how tone deaf some Washington policy makers can be.
