The four-time Grammy winner, frequently called the \u201cpeople\u2019s diva,\u201d enjoys mixing things up and venturing into new territory, such as her recent vocal rendering of David Letterman\u2019s Top 10 List. Now Fleming is taking the ambassador role a huge step further with American Voices \u2013 a festival of performances, master sessions and symposia November 22-24 at the Kennedy Center in Washington. It will be filmed for a future PBS special, but the talks, performances and Q&A sessions will be available for viewing on the Kennedy Center website right away.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always been fascinated with singers across genre,\u201d Fleming says. \u201cI myself sang jazz in college, Broadway as well, and I love and listen avidly to singers. We have so much in common that people are not aware of. I thought, \u2018Wouldn\u2019t it be wonderful to get together and explore all of this?\u2019 People underestimate, I think, what it takes to be a great singer.\u201d\n\nYoung singers will get instruction from top artists recruited by Fleming, among them Alison Krauss in country, Dianne Reeves in jazz and Sutton Foster in musical theater. Free concerts will be presented featuring each genre and on the night of the 23rd Fleming will present the American Voices Concert, joined by high-profile singers in all genres.\n\nTo arrange such an ad hoc university of voice required an abiding passion to help singers. Fleming says she has that. \u201cI do, I absolutely do, and for perpetuating vocal health and longevity and being supportive of each other. Some singers have difficulty surviving in terms of making a living. I\u2019ve learned that people in Nashville tour all the time, and that jazz singers have challenges because the field has gotten so broad. Certainly opera has some huge challenges. That\u2019s the field I know best. It will be exciting to share information.\u201d\n\nCertainly, working cross-genre is nothing new for the star. Even as we speak, she has on her Facebook page a YouTube video of herself and the late Lou Reed singing Reed\u2019s \u201cPerfect Day\u201d for V\u00e1clav Havel. On other occasions, she\u2019s worked with Dave Grusin and Paul Simon. \u201cIt\u2019s really been wonderful to have those opportunities. I enjoy that very much \u2014 the idea of collaboration. We each have mutual respect for each other and what we do. It\u2019s stimulating for me.\u201d\n\nShe is also stimulated by \u201ctraveling the world all the time, and finding there is such a passion for singing now. I\u2019ve never seen anything like it. I was in China recently and they have all these \u2018We\u2019ve Got Talent\u2019 and singing competition shows on.\u201d She smiles. \u201cAnd I also discovered that my audience in China is under 30 and very enthusiastic about opera.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"page_title": "blog", "twitter": {"description": "National Medal of Arts recipient Ren\u00e9e Fleming, 54, has become an ever-more-widely recognized ambassador for opera and the art of singing in recent years.
