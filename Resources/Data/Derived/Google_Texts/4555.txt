Paisley “twerked” his back, and needed some medical attention while co-hosting the CMAs with Underwood

Carrie Underwood and Brad Paisley were greeted with an uproar of applause after skewering Obamacare’s technical problems at the Country Music Awards on Wednesday night.

“Hey, do you have that Obamacare?” Underwood asked Paisley after he complained that he “twerked” his back. “It’s great! I started signing up last Thursday and I’m almost done.”

The country duo — who have hosted the CMAs together six times in a row — then performed a modified rendition of George Strait‘s “Amarillo by Morning” by singing “Obamacare by Morning.”

“Obamacare by morning. Why’s this taking so long?” Paisley and Underwood harmonized. “I’m gonna wind up with hemorrhoids, if I sit here till dawn.”

President Barack Obama’s administration has been under fire from opponents of the Affordable Care Act after HealthCare.gov launched in early October, and users were greeted with a host of technical problems that made signing up for the program an arduous task.

Although Health and Human Services secretary Kathleen Sebelius told Congress to put the blame on her shoulders, and vowed to fix the glitches, she told Congress’ Senate Finance Committee on Wednesday that it will be hard to have the website fully functional by the end of November.
