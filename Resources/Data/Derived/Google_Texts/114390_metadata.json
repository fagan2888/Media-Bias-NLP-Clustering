Some insurance companies also used Bloomquist\u2019s services as a consultant, his father said.\n\n\u201cSmall insurance companies that can\u2019t afford a psychologist or psychiatrist on staff, they would hire him,\u201d he said.\n\nBloomquist moved to Denver about 15 years ago, his father said.\n\nHe was a U.S. Air Force veteran who served at Travis Air Force Base.\n\nHe was an animal lover who left dead trees standing on his property in Aurora because the neighborhood squirrels \u201cloved them.\u201d\n\nHe also fed the rodents, putting peanuts in a pickle jar and watching them eat. \u201cHe would come home at night and the squirrels would greet him in the driveway \u2014 they wanted their peanuts,\u201d Darrell Bloomquist said.\n\nBloomquist was working in a high-risk occupation.\n\nAccording to Occupational Safety and Health Administration, taxi drivers are 20 times more likely than other workers to be slain on the job.\n\nNationally, an average of 34 cab drivers were killed each year while on the job between 1994 and 2013, according to the website Taxi Library, a noncommercial, educational website serving the taxicab industry worldwide.\n\nOSHA suggests safety measures for cab owners that include barriers such as bullet-resistant glass between drivers and passengers; security cameras; and silent alarms.\n\nTom McGhee: 303-954-1671, tmcghee@denverpost.com or twitter.com/dpmcghee", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Murdered Denver cabby was moonlighting to pay bills", "title": "Murdered Denver cabby was moonlighting to pay bills", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/09/06/murdered-denver-cabby-was-moonlighting-to-pay-bills/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "height": 630}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-09-06T14:25:58+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-09-06T14:25:58+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd901c\"", "article_summary": "The couple got a loan for their Aurora home when both were working, Darrell Bloomquist said.\n\u201cHe would come home at night and the squirrels would greet him in the driveway \u2014 they wanted their peanuts,\u201d Darrell Bloomquist said.\nAccording to Occupational Safety and Health Administration, taxi drivers are 20 times more likely than other workers to be slain on the job.\nBloomquist \u201cwas in deep financial shape,\u201d said his 68-year-old father, Darrell, of Billings, Mont.\nAfter she was injured, they could no longer keep up with their bills, and Bloomquist moonlighted driving a cab."}
