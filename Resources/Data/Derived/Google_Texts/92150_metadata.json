We were strongly opposed to that invasion, because we knew that things were moving in the direction of dividing societies and creating unrest. And we are Iraq\u2019s neighbors. At that time, we saw that the war would turn Iraq into a sectarian country; into a society divided against itself. To the west of Syria there is another sectarian country \u2013 Lebanon. We are in the middle. We knew well that we would be affected. Consequently, the beginning of the Syrian crisis, or what happened in the beginning, was the natural result of that war and the sectarian situation in Iraq, part of which moved to Syria, and it was easy for them to incite some Syrian groups on sectarian grounds.\u201d\n\nHe went on to mention that the West \u201cofficially\u201d adopted terrorism in Afghanistan in the early 1980s, calling the terrorists\u201cfreedom fighters,\u201d and that it didn\u2019t fight Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS/ISIL) when it appeared in Iraq under American sponsorship in 2006.\n\n\n\nofficial MintPress sponsor official MintPress sponsor\n\n\u201cAll these things together created the conditions for the unrest with Western support and Gulf money, particularly from Qatar and Saudi Arabia, and with Turkish logistic support, particularly since President Erdogan belongs intellectually to the Muslim Brotherhood. Consequently, he believes that, if the situation changed in Syria, Egypt, and Iraq, it means the creation of a new sultanate; not an Ottoman sultanate this time, but a sultanate for the Brotherhood extending from the Atlantic to the Mediterranean and ruled by Erdogan.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll these factors together brought things to what we have today. Once again, I say that there were mistakes, and mistakes always create gaps and weak points, but they are not sufficient to cause that alone, and they do not justify what happened. And if these gaps and weak points are the cause, why didn\u2019t they lead to revolutions in the Gulf States \u2013 particularly in Saudi Arabia which doesn\u2019t know anything about democracy? The answer is self-evident, I believe.\u201d\n\nOn ISIS and terrorism\n\nAssad said that Syria is \u201cat war\u201d with terrorism which is supported by foreign powers, and that political forces should unite around what Syrians want \u2013 which is security and safety for everyone.\n\n\u201cThat means we should first unite against terrorism. That is logical and self-evident,\u201d Assad said.\n\nHe stated: \u201cThere are forces fighting terrorism now alongside the Syrian state, which had previously fought against the Syrian state. We have made progress in this regard, but I would like to take this opportunity to call on all forces to unite against terrorism, because it is the way to achieve the political objectives which we, as Syrians, want through dialogue and political action.\u201d\n\nWhen asked about making the border area with Turkey an area free of Islamic State, Assad said that notion implies that terrorism is allowed in other regions. \u201cThat is unacceptable,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cTerrorism should be eradicated everywhere; and we have been calling for three decades for an international coalition to fight terrorism.\u201d\n\nOn the refugee crisis\n\nReferring to the refugee crisis currently underway in Europe, the Syrian president said the West is \u201ccrying for the refugees with one eye and aiming at them with a machinegun with the second one.\u201d\n\nElaborating on that statement, Assad added: \u201cIf you are worried about [refugees], stop supporting terrorists. That\u2019s what we think regarding the crisis. This is the core of the whole issue of refugees.\u201d\n\nHe added that Western propaganda is reporting that the refugees are fleeing the Syrian government \u2013 which media outlets call a \u201cregime\u201d \u2013 even though they are actually fleeing terrorists.\n\nThat \u201cpropaganda\u201d will only lead to more refugees for the West, the Syrian president said.\n\n\u201c\u2026Now [the West says] there is terrorism like Al-Nusra and ISIS, but because of the Syrian state or the Syrian regime or the Syrian president. So, as long as they follow this propaganda, they will have more refugees.\u201d\n\nOn Western propaganda blaming Assad for the civil war\n\nAssad accused Western propaganda of oversimplifying the Syrian crisis and reporting that \u201cthe whole problem in Syria lies in one individual.\u201d He added the consequence of that rhetoric is for people to say \u201clet that individual go and things will be alright.\u201d\n\nHe also said the West will continue to support terrorism as long as he is in power \u201cbecause the Western principle followed now in Syria and Russia and other countries is changing presidents, changing states, or what they call bringing regimes down. Why? Because they do not accept partners and do not accept independent states.\u201d\n\nHe said that in Syria, the president comes into power through the people and through elections \u2013 and if he goes, he goes through the people. He stressed that a leader doesn\u2019t go \u201cas a result of an American decision, a Security Council decision, the Geneva conference, or the Geneva communiqu\u00e9.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf the people want [a leader] to stay, he should stay; and if the people reject him, he should leave immediately. This is the principle according to which I look at this issue.\u201d\n\nOn a political solution to the Syrian crisis\n\nAssad said that Damascus needs to continue dialogue between \u201cSyrian entities\u201d and \u201cpolitical entities or political currents,\u201dwhile simultaneously fighting terrorism, in order to reach a consensus about the country\u2019s future.\n\n\u201cWe have to continue dialogue in order to reach consensus as I said, but if you want to implement anything real, it\u2019s impossible to do anything while you have people being killed, bloodletting hasn\u2019t stopped, people feel insecure. Let\u2019s say we sit together as Syrian political parties or powers and achieve a consensus regarding something in politics, in economy, in education, in health, in everything. How can we implement it if the priority of every single Syrian citizen is to be secure? So, we can achieve consensus, but we cannot implement unless we defeat the terrorism in Syria. We have to defeat terrorism, not only ISIS.\u201d\n\nOn cooperation with Russia & Iran\n\nThe Syrian president said Damascus would be prepared to cooperate with \u201cfriendly countries\u201d in its fight against terrorism, particularly Russia and Iran.\n\nCalling the relationship between Syria and Iran an \u201cold one,\u201d Assad said the alliance is \u201cbased on a great deal of trust.\u201d\n\n\u201cIran supports Syria and the Syrian people. It stands with the Syrian state politically, economically and militarily,\u201d he said, adding that Iranian support has been essential for Syria during \u201cthis difficult and ferocious war.\u201d\n\nHowever, he laid to rest claims by Western media that Tehran has sent an army or armed forces to Syria.\n\n\u201cThat is not true. It sends us military equipment, and of course there is an exchange of military experts between Syria and Iran. This has always been the case, and it is natural for this cooperation to grow between the two countries in a state of war,\u201dAssad said.\n\nAs for Russia, Assad said \u201cthere is a good, strong and historical relation between Moscow and Damascus.\u201d\n\nBut Assad also said that Syria has \u201cno veto\u201d on any country, \u201cprovided that it has the will to fight terrorism and not as they are doing in what is called the \u2018international coalition\u2019 led by the United States.\u201d\n\n\u201cCountries like Turkey, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and Western countries which provide cover for terrorism like France, the United States, or others, cannot fight terrorism. You cannot be with and against terrorism at the same time. But if these countries decide to change their policies and realize that terrorism is like a scorpion, if you put it in your pocket, it will sting you. If that happens, we have no objection to cooperating with all these countries, provided it is a real and not a fake coalition to fight terrorism.\u201d\n\nHowever, he stressed the Kurds \u201care not allies at this stage, as some suggest.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are many fallen Kurdish soldiers who fought with the army, which means they are an integral part of society. But there are parties which had certain demands, and we addressed some at the beginning of the crisis. There are other demands which have nothing to do with the state, and which the state cannot address. There are things which would relate to the entire population, to the constitution, and the people should endorse these demands before a decision can be taken by the state. In any case, anything proposed should be in the national framework. That\u2019s why I say that we are with the Kurds, and with other components, all of us in alliance to fight terrorism.\u201d\n\nHe added that once the terrorists are defeated in Syria, Kurdish demands \u201cexpressed by certain parties\u201d can be discussed nationally.\n\nThis article originally appeared on RT.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "In a rare interview with Russian media, including RT, Syrian President Bashar Assad opened up about terrorism, the refugee crisis, and Western propaganda.
