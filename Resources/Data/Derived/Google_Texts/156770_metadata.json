And while the discounts are welcome, narrow networks are also getting pushback from consumers if their favorite health care providers don't happen to be in that network.\n\nJoseph Berardo Jr., chief executive of the health plan management firm MagnaCare, argued that a well-designed narrow network is one that delivers financial savings and also enables members to go outside the network if necessary.\n\n\n\nBerardo pointed out that narrow networks contribute to the affordability of several of the new health insurance plans offered in New Jersey on the HealthCare.gov exchange under the Affordable Care Act. And narrow networks are increasingly common off the exchange: In some cases, health plan members have lower out-of-pocket expenses or aren\u2019t subject to deductibles if they stick with the doctors and hospitals in the narrow network.\n\n\n\n\u201cThis is really the only way to get to the price point that I think everyone believes will be attractive to the consumer,\u201d Berardo said.\n\n\n\nMagnaCare provides health plan management, including claims and customer service. Clients include CarePoint, a health care system of three hospitals and a network of physicians in Hudson County that offers a Medicare Advantage product focused on the CarePoint network. The CentraState Healthcare System in Freehold offers employers a health plan focused on its hospitals and doctors, and Barnabas Health has announced it will begin offering a health plan next year.\n\n\n\nThe payer, who may be a health insurer or a self-insured plan administrator, negotiates a lower reimbursement rate with providers in the narrow network and passes the saving along through lower premiums.\n\nCLICK HERE to subscribe to the NJBIZ email newsletter\n\n\n\nBerardo said the cost savings that result from a narrow network are compelling: \u201cYou\u2019re looking at a price point that could be 15 and 20 percent below the broader network.\u201d\n\n\n\nHealth insurance broker David Oscar with Altigro agreed: \u201cThe huge advantage of a narrow network is that the premium is reduced drastically.\u201d\n\n\n\nBerardo said the move to narrow networks goes hand in hand with the rise of consumer choice in health care.\n\n\n\nFor example, individuals select their own health plans at HealthCare.gov. And employers are increasingly offering \u201cprivate exchanges\u201d where workers get a set sum of money from the employer to shop for their own health plan. Experts say when consumers buy their own health care, they often choose less expensive plans that in many cases achieve savings through higher deductibles or narrow networks.\n\n\n\nBerardo said that traditionally New Jersey health plans would offer members a huge network of providers, but generally members would use nearby hospitals and doctors. He said as narrow networks increase, \u201cPeople are going to choose systems of care around the communities where they work or live.\u201d\n\n\n\nOscar said the downside is that narrow networks exclude certain providers. \u201cFor the communities that are willing to change doctors, the narrow networks are wonderful,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nFor most people, the local hospital and the neighborhood doctor will meet their medical needs. But Berardo said the well-designed narrow network \u201chas to provide a secondary network for things that their system of care doesn\u2019t provide, and that could be cancer care or cardiac care. Although people will be choosing programs that keep them in a more tightly managed, integrated system of care, there is going to be a recognition that you have to let people pull a safety valve in certain conditions and go to other centers of excellence.\u201d\n\n\n\nOscar said the key to making narrow networks work is to educate the members of the health plan on how to use them. For example, in some narrow networks, the member can\u2019t use out-of-network providers at all; in other cases, the member can go outside the network but will have higher out-of-pocket expenses.\n\n\n\n\u201cIf the members are not educated as to how their narrow network works, and how to find the correct doctors and hospitals within those networks, they are going to be out of luck,\u201d Oscar said. \u201cAs long as the plans can teach people how to use narrow networks, they will be fine.\u201d\n\n\n\nBerardo said narrow networks are part of the widespread reorganization of health care, in which hospital systems are acquiring or affiliating with primary care physicians in order to achieve \u201cclinical integration\u201d or systems of care that endeavor to both improve patient health and avoid unnecessary spending.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe most meaningful thing in health reform that I\u2019ve seen is the reorganization of the medical delivery system to be completely focused on clinical integration, and it will take us 10 years to probably get there.\u201d Berardo envisions a health care landscape of clinically integrated health systems, in some cases with a hospital at the center, and health care management companies like MagnaCare \u201cwill kind of quilt those systems together and offer products to employers.\u201d\n\nALSO ON NJBIZ:\n\nNJBIZ Healthcare Heroes winners: Top ten bring home big awards for their service\n\nN.J. firm earns dubious \u201chonor\u201d: One of the worst to work for\n\nDespite incentive package, Dietz & Watson facility and jobs will leave N.J.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "NJBIZ", "description": "Health plans that offer lower prices to members who use a so-called \u201cnarrow network\u201d of hospitals and doctors are becoming more common.
