In preparation, Google has stockpiled some new investor goodwill by shrewdly mega-goosing its stock price in its July 2Q15 earnings by respecting key investor concerns for the first time, and by breaking out the financials of Google\u2019s big \u201cmoonshot\u201d investments to try and garner some of the high-valuation pixie-dust that hot innovation startups attract in Silicon Valley.\n\nThink about this. If a global brand faced no real reputation or growth risks going forward, what company would rationally consider risking the world\u2019s #2 brand (worth $120 billion) by confusing and distracting users, investors, and the media \u2014 with a new superseding \u201cAlphabet\u201d brand that will never be a verb? What CEO or brand expert would choose this enormous \u201cAlphabet-Google\u201d brand name dissonance over \u201cGoogle\u201d alone\u2026 unless they were sure that they needed to get ahead of, and mitigate, a big upcoming, uncontrollably-bad, global risk to the Google brand?\n\nLet\u2019s consider what the new evidence tells us.\n\nAbout two weeks after announcing Alphabet, Google submitted its legal defense against the EU\u2019s search bias antitrust charges, in which it said the EU\u2019s conclusions, that Google was dominant and abusing its dominance, \u201care wrong as a matter of fact, law, and economics.\u201d\u2019 Effectively Google\u2019s antitrust legal argument is that Google is not an \u201cessential facility\u201d and thus cannot be unbundled. This concede-nothing-stance is indicative of a defendant that knows it faces a difficult protracted legal battle and that it expects no EU interest in a fourthround of settlement negotiations with Google.\n\nGoogle must have learned privately months ago what the EU\u2019s Antitrust Chief Margrethe Vestager signaled publicly at an American antitrust conference October 2nd: \u201cWhat I can say is this: The more structural the remedy, the better,\u201d [Other types of concessions] \u201cgenerally present more risks\u2026can be particularly difficult to monitor [and] are also in place only for a defined period of time\u2026 [The preference for structural remedies for antitrust concerns applies] \u201cacross all sectors,\u201d per WSJ reporting.\n\nSince negotiated settlements are for \u201ca defined period of time,\u201d this indicates that the EU is on path to some sort of structural/unbundling remedy involving permanent EU supervision. Also remember last November, the European Parliament passed a resolution 384-174 that called \u201con the Commission to consider proposals aimed at unbundling search engines from other commercial services\u2026\u201d\n\nIn April, the EU also opened a formal investigation into whether or not Google-Android has \u201cillegally hindered the development and market access of rival applications and services bytying or bundling certain Google applications and servicesdistributed on Android devices.\u201d If Google is found guilty of abuses of dominance here as well, the remedy would likely be mandating Google unbundling of apps from Android.\n\nOn privacy, last week the EU\u2019s High Court invalidated the fifteen-year-old U.S.-EU Data Safe Harbor, and France, taking the lead for the EU, rejected Google\u2019s implementation of Europe\u2019s High Court ruling requiring Google to allow for a European Right to Be Forgotten. In addition to those major privacy actions, top EU member countries are also seeking to enforce that Google offer an opt out from consolidation of their private data across services, and to potentially require storage of European private data on European soil under clear European legal jurisdiction.\n\nThe EU is far from the only source of international structural antitrust/privacy risks for Alphabet-Google.\n\nIn Russia, last month Russian antitrust authorities found Google-Android guilty of abusing its dominant Android licensed operating system dominance by tying/bundling search and other apps with Android, and this month the same authorities ordered Google to unbundle Google apps from Android by removing contractual tying arrangements by next month. In June, Russia mimicked the EU and proposed a strict Russian Right to be Forgotten. In addition, this October the Moscow City Court banned Google from using bots to read Russian users\u2019 personal emails \u2013 i.e. effectively illegal wiretapping.\n\nIn India the Competition Commission of India charged Google in August with illegally rigging search results. Canada and Brazil each have ongoing search bias antitrust investigations into Google.\n\nIn China, we learned last month that China\u2019s Internet czar is requiring Google and other top American tech companies to provide \u201csecure and controllable\u201d backdoors/encryption key access to their systems and even potentially hand over source code \u2013 if they want to provide products and services in China.\n\nIn sum, Alphabet-Google knows it faces a difficult gauntlet of antitrust investigations into search and Android, in addition to many investigations into privacy violations that could pressure Google to localize data in different countries.\n\nAll of this presents ongoing risks to the Google and Android brands with a large percentage of Google and Android users overseas, over a long period of time. Being branded by antitrust authorities as dominant and abusing its dominance to harm consumers and innovation could threaten to devalue the Google global brand, explaining in part why Google has been demoted to just an Alphabet company, albeit its largest.\n\nAs I have written for a couple of years, the Snowden NSA revelations marked the peak of America\u2019s dominance of the Internet. Since then the rest of the world has been actively de-Americanizing the Internet with the unwitting help of U.S. policymakers. For Alphabet, the company formally known as Google, this means that much of the rest of the world will be increasingly sovereign-izing Alphabet-Google in requiring it to respect their varying sovereign rules of law.\n\nIn a nutshell, Alphabet-Google apparently foresees that its former maximally-efficient, unencumbered, infrastructure and operating model, is going to become less efficient and more encumbered due to its serial and systemic abuses of its dominance and data protection.\n\nIf the Google Era was largely about the world submitting to Google\u2019s dictates to others, apparently the Alphabet Era may become more about Alphabet-Google increasingly submitting to sovereign nations\u2019 rule of law \u2013 at least outside the U.S.\n\n[Originally published at Precursor Blog]\n\nScott Cleland served as Deputy U.S. Coordinator for International Communications & Information Policy in the George H.
