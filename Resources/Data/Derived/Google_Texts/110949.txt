Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), a Jewish-American, told CNN’s Dana Bash on Sunday morning that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu made an “arrogant statement” when he said he speaks for all Jews in anticipation of his address to a joint session of Congress this upcoming week.

Feinstein said Netanyahu “doesn’t at all” speak for her on the issue of Iran. Democrats have long said Netanyahu’s address to Congress could put nuclear negotiations with Iran in jeopardy, while Republicans and Netanyahu believe the U.S. should increase sanctions on Iran and refrain from engaging in peace talks.

“I think it’s a rather arrogant statement,” Feinstein said on State of the Union. “I think the Jewish community is like any other community — there are different points of view. So I think that arrogance does not befit Israel, candidly.”

Feinstein did not go as far as to say the timing of Netanyahu’s speech to Congress (just a few weeks before he faces re-election in Israel) is “arrogant,” but rather a “sign of a political move.”

Feinstein and her Democratic Senate colleagues invited Netanyahu to meet with them during his visit to Washington, but he declined.
