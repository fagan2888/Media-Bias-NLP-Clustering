Statistics guru Nate Silver, who has earned a reputation in recent years for uncannily accurate election forecasts, sees the Republican Party poised to win big this fall: He gives the GOP a 60 percent chance of retaking the Senate.

In an appearance on ABC’s “This Week,” the former New York Times blogger predicted that Republicans will likely pick up the six seats they need to regain control of the chamber and, he said, there’s a 30 percent chance the party could win even more seats — as many as 10 or 11.

He didn’t, however, like Scott Brown’s chances in his newly adopted state of New Hampshire, giving the former Massachusetts senator a 1 in 4 chance of unseating the incumbent Democrat, Sen. Jeanne Shaheen.
