That means the employer pays worker medical expenses out of pocket.\n\nLast year, 95 percent of employers with more than 20,000 employees were self-insured, compared with 55 percent of employers with 500 to 999 employees, according to benefits consulting firm Mercer. Among small employers it is much less common.\n\nCompanies that self-insure usually hire other firms - typically name-brand insurance companies - to administer their plans, which includes dealing with participants and processing claims. This makes it seem as if the insurance company pays expenses when in fact the employer does.\n\nWhen medical expenses are higher than expected, self-insured companies must cut back the health plan, trim other expenses or let profit suffer.\n\nArmstrong made the \"distressed baby\" comment to explain, in part, why the company was making an unpopular cutback in its 401(k) plan.\n\nIn 2012, \"We had two AOL-ers that had distressed babies that were born that we paid a million dollars each to make sure those babies were OK in general,\" Armstrong said in a conference call with employees. \"So when we had the final decision about what benefits to cut because of the increased health care costs, we made the decision, and I made the decision, to basically change the 401(k) plan.\"\n\nAOL reversed the planned 401(k) change on Feb. 8 after his comments sparked a nationwide uproar.\n\nThree of AOL's four medical insurance options were self-insured in 2012, according to its summary health care plan description. The fourth, a health maintenance organization, was fully insured, meaning the insurance companies running the plan - not AOL - were on the hook for medical expenses. The company did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nWhat's puzzling is why AOL it paid out $1 million per baby.\n\nAnnual limit\n\nMost self-insured companies purchase stop-loss insurance to protect themselves against catastrophic cases. It caps the amount they must pay on an individual's claims each year. Anything over the limit is paid by the insurer. Companies can decide where they want this attachment point.\n\n\"It can be as low as $50,000 up to $750,000 or even $1 million,\" says Christopher Renz, a partner with Mercer in San Francisco.\n\nIn general, the smaller the company, the lower the limit.\n\nEmployers with more than 20,000 workers often forgo stop-loss insurance, says Renz.\n\nIt's unclear whether AOL - which had 5,600 employees at the end of 2012 - had stop-loss insurance.\n\nAmong companies with 5,000 to 9,999 employees, 67 percent were insured with stop-loss insurance (with a median attachment point of $325,000) and 25 percent were self-insured without stop-loss insurance, according to Mercer.\n\nCompanies are not required to disclose to employees that they are self-insured. Some do; others leave hints in their annual summary health-plan description.\n\nUnlike fully insured plans, which are regulated by states, self-insured plans are regulated by the U.S. Department of Labor. If the description mentions the Labor Department, it is almost certainly self-insured.\n\nCompanies with employees in many states often self-insure so they have to deal with only one regulator and avoid the taxes many states impose on health plans.\n\nIt is generally 5 to 10 percent cheaper to self-insure than fully insure.\n\n\"Also, employers can design whatever benefit structure they want,\" when they self-insure, says Betsy Imholz, special projects director with Consumers Union.\n\nLast year, 61 percent of workers nationally were enrolled in a partly or completely self-insured plan, according a California HealthCare Foundation report.\n\nIn California, this number was only 36 percent because of \"California's high HMO enrollment, since HMOs are less likely than other plans to be self-insured,\" the report says.\n\nAn employer is not required to pass along any cost savings it gets from self-insuring to employees. It can decide what percentage of health care costs it will absorb and how much employees will pay.\n\nFor employees, the differences between self- and fully insured plans are subtle.\n\nA self-insured plan might not provide some benefits mandated by certain states, such as acupuncture in California.\n\nAlso, in a self-insured plan, the employer generally decides whether to approve certain drugs or services that are not part of the plan design, says Anthony Lopez, a small-business group insurance specialist with eHealthInsurance.\n\nDecision makers\n\n\"If a child needs a special and very expensive drug infusion beyond a specific coverage cap, an appeal to the employer may in some cases result in approval, while coverage caps under commercially insured plans may be more strictly enforced,\" Lopez says.\n\nSome self-insured employers delegate this decision-making to their administrators. In a fully insured plan, the insurance company decides.\n\nSelf-insured plans also do not have to comply with certain provisions of the Affordable Care Act, such as one that requires plans to provide rebates if the percentage of premiums spent on medical services falls below a certain level, according to the UC Berkeley Labor Center.\n\nSome predict this could lead smaller companies to self-insure.\n\nThere is some concern that if employers with young, healthy workforces self-insure, \"they would be kept out of the broader risk pool, thereby making insurance (for everyone else) even more expensive,\" Renz says.\n\nTo discourage that, California passed a law last year that sets minimum attachment points for stop-loss insurance.\n\nFor policies issued in 2014 and 2015, \"it set the individual attachment point at $35,000,\" says Marta Green, a spokeswoman for the California Department of Managed Health Care. For policies issued after 2015, it is $40,000.\n\n\"This says they cannot buy stop-loss insurance all the way to zero. You cannot shield yourself entirely,\" Green says.", "article_metadata": {"SKYPE_TOOLBAR": "SKYPE_TOOLBAR_PARSER_COMPATIBLE", "sailthru.author": "Kathleen Pender", "description": "AOL chief Tim Armstrong's unfortunate comment about two \"distressed babies\" costing the company a million dollars each in medical expenses shined a light on something most employees don't know.
