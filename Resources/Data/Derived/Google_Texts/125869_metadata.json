Operated by the Tampa Bay Times, the website is cited regularly by media outlets across the country as an authority on what is and is not true. But how do they go about fact-checking claims they investigate?\n\nPolitiFact routinely embeds links in its stories to supporting materials, but how does it reach out to an author of a column it is fact-checking? Turns out it\u2019s not by phone or email, it\u2019s Twitter.\n\nLouis Jacobson, PolitiFact\u2019s deputy editor, wrote a piece \u201cfact-checking\u201d a column by National Review\u2019s Jonah Goldberg, who cited National Review\u2019s Kevin Williamson. The crux of the column was about Obamacare\u2019s embrace of alternative medicine. The content of the column is irrelevant, what matters is this line in Jacobson\u2019s fact-check:\n\nNeither Williamson nor Goldberg returned inquiries for this fact-check.\n\nThis appears to have caught both writers off guard, unaware of Jacobson\u2019s attempt. So, being curious, not only as to how their columns could be declared \u201chalf-true,\u201d but how they both missed his attempted contact, they inquired via Twitter.\n\nThe usual horsepucky from @PolitiFact. \"Half true\" rating while not identifying one error. Useless, craven hacks. http://t.co/1UTdmf8ei9 \u2014 Kevin D. Williamson (@KevinNR) February 24, 2015\n\nNo, they didn't. Nothing in my email, no phone call, etc. @DanFostersEthos @PolitiFact \u2014 Kevin D. Williamson (@KevinNR) February 24, 2015\n\nJust curious @PolitiFact, how did you try to contact me? \u2014 Jonah Goldberg (@JonahNRO) February 25, 2015\n\nJacobson replied:\n\n@KevinNR Sorry you didn't see my tweet yesterday morning, here: http://t.co/6PD4IxSNVu Happy to consider/link to comments as addendum \u2014 Louis Jacobson (@loujacobson) February 25, 2015\n\nGoldberg answered:\n\nWait. A. Second. Did @politifact tweet at me as a way to contact me for comment? https://t.co/HPZKMZ12N0 \u2014 Jonah Goldberg (@JonahNRO) February 25, 2015\n\nJust to be clear I don't know that @Politifact tweeted at me for comment like they did with @KevinNR https://t.co/HPZKMZ12N0 \u2014 Jonah Goldberg (@JonahNRO) February 25, 2015\n\nWilliamson was much more, um, direct:\n\nJesus H. Christ, you useless rube\u2013I have an office with a receptionist and everything. Pick up a goddamned telephone, genius. @loujacobson \u2014 Kevin D. Williamson (@KevinNR) February 25, 2015\n\nIt's not like we're not in the phone book. Or like our number isn't on the web site. @SamaDaMana @notropis01 @loujacobson \u2014 Kevin D.

Williamson (@KevinNR) February 25, 2015\n\nHere is Jacobson\u2019s original tweet:\n\n@KevinNR I'm checking an interesting claim by you for PolitiFact re ACA & alternatv medicine.
