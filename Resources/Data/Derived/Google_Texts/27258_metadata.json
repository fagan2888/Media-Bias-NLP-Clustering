Conservative opinions. Opinions he\u2019s willing to publicly express despite the risks.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re a celebrity and you endorse a Republican, it\u2019s sort of like career suicide,\u201d Harrison, the star of the \u201cPawn Stars\u201d television show, said in a recent interview with The Daily Caller. \u201cBut I\u2019m at a point in my life where I don\u2019t care.\u201d\n\nThe show about his family business \u2014 the Gold & Silver Pawn Shop here on Las Vegas Boulevard \u2014 is one of the History channel\u2019s most popular and has made him a lot of money. (Before the TV show, the store saw 100 customers a day; Harrison now estimates 4,000 people walk through his door daily).\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve already been told it\u2019s cost me endorsements,\u201d Harrison said of his political activism. \u201cBut the thing is I\u2019m a well-off guy and I care about my kids. You know what I mean? I could quit working tomorrow and I\u2019d be fine for the rest of my life. I want my kids, my grandkids, to have a great life.\u201d\n\nHis latest journey into the political world includes endorsing Marco Rubio for president. He has already made several trips across the country for the Florida senator and says he will help as much as the campaign wants him too.\n\n\u201cI just agree with so much he has to say,\u201d Harrison said while seated at a conference table in the back of his pawn shop. \u201cHe\u2019s a powerful speaker. He knows foreign policy. He wants to bring trade schools back, which I think is a huge deal.\u201d\n\nHarrison said he first met Rubio earlier this year at a small political event in Las Vegas. The two later had breakfast in Los Angeles. He liked what he saw. \u201cIt\u2019s a guy I believe genuinely cares,\u201d he said. \u201cI mean, I can read people.\u201d\n\nBut what about the argument that Rubio is the Republican version of President Obama \u2014 an inspiring speaker but no executive experience?\n\n\u201cI know guys who ran pawn shops for 50 years,\u201d Harrison said. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t pay them 50 cents an hour to work here. Experience isn\u2019t everything.\u201d\n\nWhat about Donald Trump, the presidential candidate with a Vegas hotel named after him?\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s put it like this,\u201d Harrison said. \u201cHim growing up, he never once heard the words, \u2018no son we can\u2019t afford that.\u2019 It doesn\u2019t make him a bad person or anything. I just think he can\u2019t understand the American people like other people can.\u201d\n\nOn education, Harrison says: \u201cThis whole idea of Common Core is the most ridiculous thing on the planet. The thing is we can\u2019t have a cookie cutter system where you train every kid to go to college \u2014 even kids you know aren\u2019t going to college.\u201d\n\nOn regulations, Harrison says: \u201cThere\u2019s a reason why when Reagan became president, he started getting rid of regulations and we had a booming economy.\u201d\n\nOn being a small business owner: \u201cThe problem we have in this country \u2014 it\u2019s a nightmare to do business anymore\u2026Make it easy to do business, it will bring people out of poverty, plain and simple.\u201d\n\nOn Obamacare, Harrison says: \u201cMy healthcare doubles and it\u2019s for my employees and it\u2019s not nearly as good as it used to be.\u201d\n\nOn the Democratic field for president: \u201cYou have Hillary, who, quite frankly, I can\u2019t believe has not been indicted yet over the email thing\u2026.You have Bernie Sanders, who just wants to create a socialist paradise like Venezuela\u2026It sounds great. It really does. Everything for free. But it don\u2019t work.\u201d\n\nWith such strong political opinions, would he ever run for office himself?\n\n\u201cOh I could never do it.\u201d\n\nWhy?\n\n\u201cBecause if I got up there with those people,\u201d he said of politicians, \u201cI would call them all fucktards.\u201d\n\nBut hasn\u2019t Trump proven that you can run for office and say what you really think?\n\n\u201cI mean there\u2019s no way I could put up with that,\u201d he said. \u201cIt would drive me insane.\u201d\n\nStill, Harrison says he has been encouraged to run for something. \u201cI\u2019ve been asked by multiple senators to run for Reid\u2019s spot,\u201d Harrison said of the seat being vacated next year by retiring Democratic Majority leader Harry Reid .\n\nWhat sort of relationship does he have with Reid?\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve met him several times back in the day when he was more of a really conservative Democrat,\u201d he said. \u201cThen he just sort of fell off a cliff. I don\u2019t know what the hell happened to him.\u201d\n\n\u201cSome politicians are in so long they completely lose touch with reality,\u201d Harrison added.\n\nWhat does he think of the argument that \u201cPawn Stars\u201d \u2014 portraying a family business, the free-market at work and people shooting guns \u2014 is a conservative show?\n\n\u201cThis is normal life for people,\u201d he said of his show. \u201cOK? What\u2019s normal life for the majority people of America, the liberal press thinks is like \u2018oh my gosh.\u2019 We don\u2019t live in that little weird bizarre vacuum of San Francisco.\u201d\n\nOn the show, Harrison speaks fluently about the history of items brought into the store. He insisted that\u2019s not rehearsed.\n\n\u201cOn the show, I haven\u2019t seen it until its in front of me,\u201d Harrison said of the items he bids on. \u201cI think that\u2019s why the show is so successful compared to all the other shows that try to copy me. Those are all scripted. I really am that nerd.\u201d\n\n\u201cMost of it\u2019s in my head,\u201d he said of the stories he tells about the items, though he acknowledged: \u201cI have to stop and fact check sometimes.\u201d\n\nHe attributes his voracious reading appetite to his epilepsy. \u201cI only sleep about four or five hours a night. I read all night long. I read the history of batteries twice. I really did. I have a dog-eared copy of Isaac Asimov\u2019s \u201cUnderstanding Physics\u201d next to my bed.\u201d\n\nHarrison, who describes himself as a \u201cspastic guy,\u201d perked up while talking about his vacation home in Oregon, which he says is \u201ccompletely off the grid\u201d and the place where he goes to get away.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m like seven miles from a power line,\u201d he said. \u201cWe create all our own power, got a big garden.\u201d\n\nPulling out his phone to show photos of his place, Harrison says: \u201cThat\u2019s my turbine right there.\u201d\n\nHe usually spends the summer there, and can get there from Vegas in \u201c15 hours if I drive fast.\u201d\n\n\u201cI would be so-on the grid if there was a power line by me,\u201d he acknowledged with a chuckle. \u201cMost people don\u2019t realize what a pain in the ass it is.\u201d\n\nOn a recent sunny morning the day of the Democratic debate in Las Vegas, the pawnshop had a steady stream of customers walking in and out of the store. Items for sale included a $2,600 autographed Jimi Hendrix poster, a $15,000 signed photo of Elvis and a $100,000 Super Bowl championship ring.\n\nThe back of the pawn shop is a gift shop dedicated to the show. A good bit of merchandise was dedicated to the show\u2019s recurring punchline, employee Austin Russell, known to viewers as Chumlee.\n\nOne shirt for sale says: \u201cVote Chumlee for president.\u201d\n\nIf Chumlee actually ran for office one day, could he count on Harrison\u2019s support?\n\n\u201cIn a lot of cases,\u201d he said with a laugh, \u201cyou can\u2019t do any worse.\u201d\n\nFollow Alex on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Alex Pappas", "description": "Rick Harrison has lots of opinions.
