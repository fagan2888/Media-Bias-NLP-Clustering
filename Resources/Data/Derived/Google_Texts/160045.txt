Authorities in Santa Cruz County are trying to determine how a fetus ended up in the Nogales International Wastewater Treatment Plant in Rio Rico.

The Santa Cruz County Sheriff's Office received a call a little after 2 p.m. Friday, March 4 about the discovery at the plant, which is about 9 miles north of the Arizona-Mexico border, said Sheriff Tony Estrada.

A fetus had come through a 40-inch treatment pipe that comes in from Mexico, he said, although it's unclear whether the fetus entered the system from the Mexico side or the Arizona side.

The fetus was sent to the Office of the Medical Examiner in Tucson, where it was determined to be a female, about 17-18 weeks developed, 24 centimeters long and weighing 199 grams, Estrada said.

"It was pretty small. It could fit in your hand," he said, adding he's never seen anything happen like this.

The umbilical cord was still attached, and there appeared to be no signs of trauma, he said.

"You wonder what happened," Estrada said. "Did somebody abort the fetus? Did they have a miscarriage? You wonder what the mother is going through."

The grisly discovery won't affect water quality, he said.

Meanwhile, the medical examiner's office is working to determine where it came from, possibly using DNA, he said. Authorities are hoping someone will come forward who knows what happened.

"It's a tragic situation, whether it's a fetus that was aborted or a miscarriage," Estrada said.
