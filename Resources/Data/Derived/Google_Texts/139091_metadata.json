He initially studied history and philosophy at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, before heading west to the Culinary Institute of America at Greystone in St. Helena, California. But it was back home in his native city where fame found him thanks to Charm City Cakes, which was a prominent feature on Food Network\u2019s \u201cAce of Cakes.\u201d\n\nThe cheerful Mr. Goldman is set to assay not one but two shows on the network this spring, \u201cDuff Till Dawn\u201d and \u201cKids Baking Championship.\u201d\n\n\u201cDuff Till Dawn,\u201d which premieres Jan. 29, will feature professional chefs vying to create the best cakes. Mr. Goldman said his show will be different from other competitive cooking programs.\n\n\u201c[These shows] have been \u2018TV-ified\u2019 and overproduced to the point where the star has ceased to be the art of the cake decorator and has become the drama of the producer,\u201d Mr. Goldman said. \u201cAnd so what I wanted to do was kind of get back to where the star of the show was the cakes themselves and the people making them [versus] the drama of \u2018Oh, if I win I\u2019m going to get a new storefront.\u2019 The drama is already inherent.\u201d\n\nMr. Goldman said that by removing a potential payday from the equation, the artisanship of cake making will take center stage.\n\n\u201cCake decorators care about their art. It\u2019s more about the art than it is about winning a big check,\u201d he said. \u201cOnce you sort of take that financial reward away, the focus is really on [making] the best cake, not the one that\u2019s going to pass the test, not the one that\u2019s going to please the judges, not the one that\u2019s going to satisfy all the rules.\u201d\n\nTwo teams compete in the kitchen, but they also face an external obstacle in Mr. Goldman\u2019s playful but insistent vocal needling.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just basically talking smack to them in a very playful, funny way,\u201d he said. \u201cYou don\u2019t see judges getting into contestants\u2019 faces like this and having a back-and-forth with them.\u201d\n\nWhile he is upping the entertainment factor for viewers, he said, respect for his fellow chefs is paramount.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re kind of talking trash, but at the same time, we\u2019re all peers \u2014 the people who are competing are my equals. They\u2019re doing things that I\u2019ve never seen before and don\u2019t know how to do, and it\u2019s very clear that we\u2019re kind of all in this together.\u201d\n\nOn Feb. 2, the world will get a second helping of Mr. Goldman\u2019s fun-loving personality with the premiere of \u201cKids Baking Competition,\u201d co-hosted with Valerie Bertinelli. Unlike seasoned adults, he said, young bakers don\u2019t carry with them the jadedness of the professional chef trade, which shows in their joy during the show.\n\n\u201cThe way that these kids look at food and are so excited about baking their sense of excitement is the [same] that all chefs and all pastry chefs have naturally, but we\u2019re taught over a lifetime to play it close to the vest,\u201d he said of the talented children. \u201cWe\u2019re taught not to be super enthusiastic about it.\u201d\n\nLaughing, he said, \u201cThere\u2019s that old adage of when you get to the end zone you\u2019ve go to act like you\u2019ve been there before, but I\u2019ve got to tell you, man, every time I get to the end zone, I act like it\u2019s the first time. And seeing these kids and seeing the things that they get excited about are the same things that I\u2019m enthusiastic about. I get why professional chefs love watching children, because children are saying all the things that professional chefs are thinking [but aren\u2019t] socially allowed to say. I think that\u2019s what really attracts people.\u201d\n\nOf his co-host, Miss Bertinelli, Mr. Goldman offers an anecdote from their rather unusual first meeting at a \u201cHarry Potter\u201d premiere party, for which he had baked a special cake.\n\n\u201cI was talking to these two girls, and all of a sudden somebody jumped on my back. I was actually kind of ready to throw a punch, and I looked over my shoulder and I was like, \u2018Oh, Valerie Bertinelli just jumped on my back!\u2019 And she\u2019s like, \u2018I love your show! You\u2019re my favorite!\u2019 I was freaking out, like, \u2018Oh my God, I had the biggest crush on you when I was like 5.\u2019\u201d\n\nDespite his boyhood dream come true, Mr. Goldman said Miss Bertinelli is a true on-camera professional, from whom he has learned much in his television-hosting career.\n\nPerhaps it is little wonder that celebrity clients have come calling for Mr. Goldman\u2019s designs. Mr. Goldman whipped up a creation for legendary comic book creator Stan Lee\u2019s recent 92nd birthday: a 7-foot cake in the likeness of Mr. Lee\u2019s iconic Incredible Hulk character.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s looking at it, and he\u2019s like, \u2018This is a cake?\u2019 and I\u2019m like, \u2018Yeah, this is a cake.\u2019 And it\u2019s an incredible thing, but the [next] question out of his mouth was, \u2018Did you bring me a cup of coffee to enjoy my cake?\u2019 When you\u2019re Stan Lee, and you\u2019re that old, you can say whatever you want.\u201d\n\nMr. Goldman, who is Jewish, has a special affinity for baking with bacon \u2014 much to the consternation of his mother.\n\n\u201cBacon is not kosher,\u201d he said. \u201cMy mom really doesn\u2019t understand my obsession with bacon.\u201d His first week of college, Mr. Goldman went to the dining hall, where a tub of the forbidden meat product awaited. \u201cI said, \u2018I can eat as much of that as I want?\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cI think, by the end of it, I probably put away like 3 pounds of bacon. It\u2019s like meat candy!\u201d\n\nIn addition to his two upcoming shows, his bakeries and his celebrity cakes, Mr. Goldman plays bass with his own Baltimore band. (When asked whether he would ever play with former Guns N\u2019 Roses member Duff McKagan, Mr. Goldman said, \u201cWe would not jam together, because we\u2019re both bass players.\u201d) He\u2019ll also be unveiling a surprise cake for DirecTV\u2019s \u201cSuper Fan Festival\u201d for the Super Bowl.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the show,\u201d Mr. Goldman said of \u201cDuff Till Dawn,\u201d \u201cthere\u2019s a winner and a loser; there\u2019s no getting around that that\u2019s a competition. People do want to see that, but it\u2019s not so important. What is important is that these guys feel great about whatever it is that they made in the seven or eight hours that they had to do it.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Baltimore native Duff Goldman has taken a rather circuitous route to celebrity chef status.
