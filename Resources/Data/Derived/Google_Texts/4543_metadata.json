Certainly, leadership has been on display. At his first independence-day address, from Delhi\u2019s Red Fort on August 15th (see picture), he spoke of his \u201cshame\u201d at India\u2019s high rates of rape, bad sanitation, communal violence and poor work ethic. On rape, admirably, he told parents to teach sons respect for women; many Indian politicians prefer to blame the victims.\n\nMr Modi has made some bold decisions, too. He is scrapping the Planning Commission, a vestige of centralised economic thinking. In its place he wants a development think-tank, reportedly to host pro-market figures. That should herald more liberal policies and, as important, leave states rather than the centre to make many of the decisions on policy and spending. If that helps spur competition among states, all the better. One, Rajasthan, is emerging as a liberal front-runner: it has just eased labour laws and is rethinking how welfare should work.\n\nIn some other areas, however, the prime minister has done little more than tweak and tinker. That civil servants come to work earlier and spit less in stairways is progress; but it is not revolutionary. Last month\u2019s budget sought to make tax collection more efficient, but it was hardly brimming with reforms. A priority for Arun Jaitley, the finance minister, must now be a nationwide tax on goods and services.\n\nIf Mr Modi is not charging ahead as some hoped, one reason is Parliament: his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) controls the lower house but will have no majority in the upper one for at least two years. A cynical Congress party, in opposition, is blocking plans it put forward when in government, including the idea of allowing foreign firms into the insurance market. A second issue is the BJP itself, along with its Hindu-nationalist allies. Some factions are linked to unions, retailers and farmers and resist market-friendly measures. Last month Mr Modi scuppered a $1 trillion global deal by the World Trade Organisation (WTO) to facilitate trade. He did so as a sop to such groups.\n\nHe may regret that. An antitrade stance fits ill with his plans to open up India and make it a hub for exports and \u201czero defect\u201d manufacturing. He has also ducked the chance to use the WTO deal as cover for politically difficult subsidy reforms. A much-hyped infrastructure programme has yet to show. But an early plan to rejig agriculture, beginning by selling 15m tonnes of grain stockpiles, looks hopeful. Swapan Dasgupta, a pro-Modi journalist, concedes that \u201cif you are looking for a radical approach you would be right to be disappointed, but it is a question of what is doable.\u201d\n\nMr Modi\u2019s political dominance, however, is not in doubt. His closest acolyte, Amit Shah, a fellow Gujarati and Hindu nationalist, is now president of the BJP. He has just inducted new party leaders, many from the far-right Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS). Yet Mr Modi\u2019s messages and those of his allies diverge. While he talks of moderation\u2014on independence day, he called for a \u201cmoratorium\u201d on religious violence\u2014the RSS chief, Mohan Bhagwat, appears eager to antagonise. He says India\u2019s is a \u201cHindutva\u201d culture; all Indians should be called Hindus, which is news to the fifth of the population who are Muslims or members of other faiths. Perhaps he is stirring up the BJP rank-and-file before four state elections. Regrettably, Mr Modi has not contradicted him.\n\nIn government Mr Modi is earning a reputation as a stern, hardworking headmaster. Talk circulates of embittered ministers denied powers of patronage and told largely to abjure Delhi parties, foreign trips and chats to the media. The rumour that Mr Modi has ministers\u2019 phones tapped, as reportedly also happened when he ran Gujarat, needs only to be believed to deter gossip and graft. As for the press, media owners are anxious not to offend the new administration, and coverage is dull. One senior journalist calls it \u201cself-censorship\u201d, but predicts that a feistier journalism will return.\n\nMr Modi\u2019s style of leadership is plainest in security and foreign affairs. His preoccupation there probably comes at the cost of some domestic decision-making and reform. The prime minister\u2019s first aim was to make more prominent India\u2019s presence in South Asia, with successful trips to Bhutan and Nepal. He has also, with fanfare, unveiled new military hardware, such as a 6,800-tonne warship, the INS Kolkata, on August 16th. Next month Mr Modi heads to Japan and America. His foreign minister, Sushma Swaraj, is sidelined.\n\nInternationally the mood is generally benign, although Indian goodwill towards Pakistan is giving way to the more familiar hostility. As recently as May, Nawaz Sharif, Pakistan\u2019s prime minister, was in Delhi for talks with Mr Modi. But on August 19th Mr Modi contrived an excuse to scrap a meeting of foreign secretaries (ie, each country\u2019s senior career diplomat), due next week. Supposedly, it was because Pakistan officials had had a (pro forma) meeting with Kashmiri separatists.\n\nThere was little cost to calling off talks, since no breakthrough was in sight. Mr Sharif is embattled at home, thanks to army disdain of him and to anti-government protests in Islamabad, the capital. Mr Modi probably judged that his counterpart has little political capital to spare right now for detentewith India.\n\nStill, Mr Modi\u2019s churlishness will complicate future efforts to improve ties, because it discourages Pakistani moderates who argue to the Pakistani army and other doubters that engaging India is worth it. At home, however, Mr Modi has shown his core supporters in the BJP that he is a decisive break from his rather mild predecessor as prime minister, Manmohan Singh. Being grumpy towards Pakistan is an easy way to demonstrate that.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.thumb": "http://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/50_by_50/images/print-edition/20140823_ASP001_0.jpg", "sailthru.flytitle": "Indian politics", "description": "Narendra Modi, stern headmaster", "pubdate": 20140823, "og": {"site_name": "The Economist", "description": "Narendra Modi, stern headmaster", "title": "Early days", "url": "http://www.economist.com/news/asia/21613342-narendra-modi-stern-headmaster-early-days", "image": "http://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/images/print-edition/20140823_ASP001_0.jpg", "type": "article"}, "sailthru.rubric": "Narendra Modi, stern headmaster", "sailthru.date": "2014-08-23 00:00:00", "sailthru.printdate": "2014-08-23 00:00:00", "revisit-after": "1 day", "sailthru.tags": "Indian politics", "fb": {"pages": 6013004059, "app_id": 173277756049645}, "sailthru.imagepath": "images/print-edition/20140823_ASP001_0.jpg", "articleid": 21613342, "sailthru.image.full": "http://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/images/print-edition/20140823_ASP001_0.jpg", "sailthru.image.thumb_mfte": "http://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/ec_related_article_image/images/print-edition/20140823_ASP001_0.jpg", "sailthru.web_section": "Asia", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/theeconomist"}, "twitter": {"image": "https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/images/print-edition/20140823_ASP001_0.jpg", "site": "@TheEconomist", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "news_keywords": "Indian politics"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf289\"", "article_summary": "Mr Modi probably judged that his counterpart has little political capital to spare right now for detentewith India.\nLast month Mr Modi scuppered a $1 trillion global deal by the World Trade Organisation (WTO) to facilitate trade.\nIn some other areas, however, the prime minister has done little more than tweak and tinker.\nAs recently as May, Nawaz Sharif, Pakistan\u2019s prime minister, was in Delhi for talks with Mr Modi.\nIn government Mr Modi is earning a reputation as a stern, hardworking headmaster."}
