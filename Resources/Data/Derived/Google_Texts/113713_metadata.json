But does this age group need Obamacare? A recent poll by the Urban Institute found that 27% of this age group are still unaware of the Health Insurance Exchanges, which are designed to help them sign up and potentially get subsidized premiums.\n\nPhoto - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20140317/PH84108-a\n\nPhoto - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20140317/PH84108-b\n\nIn this 47-page mini-Ebook, 'Two-Minute Warning, The Young Invincibles: What the 18-34 Age Group MUST Know by March 31, 2014', Dennis Deruelle, MD, FHM uses the National Football League as the example to help this critical age group understand their options as well as the key questions to consider. This engaging, new mini-Ebook is available free of charge through December 31, 2014 via smashwords.com and drderuelle.com and for a nominal fee of $0.99 on Amazon.com.\n\nTo see Dr. Dennis Deruelle's video about his e-book, please visit here: http://player.vimeo.com/video/77155298?title=0&byline=0&portrait=0&color=edc835\n\nThe mini-Ebook breaks this group into three segments, giving them each the keys to making an informed decision at game time. A companion website, www.dennisderuellemd.com provides additional information and resources and allows visitors to sign up for the free download.\n\nDr. Deruelle said, \"Making this mini-Ebook available free of charge is important because there is a lot of misinformation and lack of awareness of the new insurance options available. I have children of my own, and I know they don't think of things like this.\" He added, \"I want them to have unbiased, doctor-driven information. I want to do my part to help their generation make informed choices.\"\n\nDr. Deruelle knows that healthcare is a personal choice and keeps the book far away from the politics that plague the law. Since the majority of the public wants to hear about Obamacare from their doctor, Dr. Deruelle comes to the rescue remaining non-partisan in his explanation of the law.\n\n'Two-Minute Warning, The Young Invincibles: What the 18-34 Age Group MUST Know by March 31st, 2014' is free and available now in Ebook format at Amazon.com. This mini-Ebook is the first in the 'Two-Minute Warning' series, which will be part of the soon-to-be-published full book (Ebook and soft cover) 'Two-Minute Warning: Are You Ready for Some Healthcare?'
