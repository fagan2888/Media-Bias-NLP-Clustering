Opinions going back to segregation in the 1950s and subsequent federal involvement in enforcing those rulings had convinced staunch segregationists that the court was a menace to society and they breathed new life into the old confederate rationalization for the civil war: States\u2019 Rights. If you happened to drive through the southern states during that period you\u2019d commonly come upon signs like this one:\n\nThe campaign to impeach the Chief Justice was originally proposed by the John Birch Society which believed that laws and constitutional interpretations promoting racial equality were a Communist plot and therefore the judges who enabled it were Communist sympathizers. Indeed, the first calls for Justice Warren\u2019s impeachment said that explicitly:\n\nAs time went on and the rights revolution expanded in the 1970s, the right wing loathing for the Supreme Court reached a fever pitch. As this article by Randall Balmer explained, once mainstream society began to get queasy about unabashed racism, the conservative movement came upon a new pitch to their followers: abortion. In 1979, six years after Roe vs Wade, they amped up their criticism of the Supreme Court on this new basis, ushering in 30 more years of shrill denunciations of \u201cjudicial activism.\u201d\n\nThe term became a code word for \u201cliberal\u201d in political campaigns as Republicans (and some of the old conservative lions of the Democratic Party before they all retired out) were called upon to make promises that they would not nominate or approve of any judicial activists for the federal bench. Politicians like President George Bush the First made speeches fulminating about it:\n\n\u201cThe judges ought not to take the place of the legislative branch of government \u2026I believe in strict constructionists.\u201d\n\n\u201cStrict constructionist\u201d was held to be the preferred philosophy on the right which basically limits a judge\u2019s discretion to interpret the law in any way that it has not been interpreted before. (The sub-category of \u201coriginalist\u201d, flamboyantly represented by Justice Antonin Scalia, says judges must inhabit the minds of the 18th century framers and interpret the laws as they would have in their own time, which is truly daft.) But in the mouth of a late 20th century Republican politician, \u201cstrict constructionist\u201d and \u201cjudicial activist\u201d were dog-whistles to the racist base which first came to loathe the Supreme Court for ruling that little African American children deserved to go to the same school as any other American and set in motion a series of legal challenges that ended the centuries old system of Jim Crow.\n\nIn more recent years it was just a rallying cry for general loathing of the courts which conservatives believed were constantly forcing white people to do things they didn\u2019t want to do. The Christian Right was particularly active politically and their long-standing gripes about prayer in school and abortion were particularly motivating.\n\nBack in 2002, Phyllis Schlafly\u2019s Eagle Forum sent out this warning declaring that the judicial activism was \u201cthe biggest issue of the 2002 election.\u201d Think about that. It was one year after 9/11 and Schlafly didn\u2019t miss a beat. By 2005, at the height of their power controlling both houses of congress and the White House, conservative legal scholars held a meeting in Washington at which Tom Delay, then the powerful House majority whip declared:\n\n\u201cThe sanctity of the Constitution is under assault from many different directions. \u201cThe branch of government charged with maintaining the sanctity of the Constitution no longer feels bound by the constraints of that same Constitution. The courts today recognize no limits on their authority. They legislate with reckless abandon. They overturn the will of the people as expressed through their legislative representatives. What we\u2019re left with is an imperial judiciary that knows no bounds to its power or its tenure. This is a recipe for tyranny!\u201d\n\nHe then brought the crowd full circle to be met with energetic applause from the room full of conservative lawyers:\n\n\u201cAmerica\u2019s founders believed that impeachment could be an effective way to keep the judiciary within its proper bounds. When judges exercise power not delegated to them by the Constitution, I think impeachment is a very proper tool.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "As they try to pull back Roe v Wade, here's why it's impossible to discern conservatives' judicial philosophy", "title": "The right\u2019s judicial hypocrisy: Why it\u2019s so inconsistent on \u201cactivism\u201d in the courts", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "As they try to pull back Roe v Wade, here's why it's impossible to discern conservatives' judicial philosophy", "title": "The right\u2019s judicial hypocrisy: Why it\u2019s so inconsistent on \u201cactivism\u201d in the courts", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/01/22/the_rights_judicial_hypocrisy_why_its_so_inconsistent_on_activism_in_the_courts/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/01/scalia_paul.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "As they try to pull back Roe v Wade, here's why it's impossible to discern conservatives' judicial philosophy", "title": "The right\u2019s judicial hypocrisy: Why it\u2019s so inconsistent on \u201cactivism\u201d in the courts", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/01/scalia_paul.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Heather Digby Parton", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Antonin Scalia, judicial activism, judicial branch, Judiciary, libertarians, Rand Paul, Roe v.
