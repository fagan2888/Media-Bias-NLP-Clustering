The difference is barely noticeable, as is the fact that the HTC handset is a fraction taller and thicker. The key difference is the HTC's unibody aluminium chassis, which helps the handset look more elegant and feel sturdier than the Samsung while only weighing 15 grams more.\n\nUnder the bonnet both smartphones pack quad-core processors accompanied by a generous 2 gigabytes of RAM. The Samsung comes out ahead in the benchmarks but neither handset will disappoint power users looking for extra grunt.\n\nImpressive built-in BoomSound speakers are the HTC's killer feature \u2013 offering rich, full sound for both movies and music which could certainly replace a portable speaker. The Samsung's speakers sound tinny in comparison.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Samsung's strengths include a water and dust-resistant design, which will suit those who like to get out and about. Its 16-megapixel camera outshines many point-and-shoot compact digitals. The Samsung takes much sharper pictures than the HTC's 4-megapixel camera, although the HTC relies on larger sensor designed to produce better low-light photos. It can also refocus shots thanks to the built-in depth sensor.\n\nWhen it comes to software, HTC's Sense 6 is more muted and elegant that Samsung's chirpy TouchWiz interface. Both handsets have access to the Google Play store, but the Samsung comes out ahead thanks to its own store with extra content and exclusive apps. Samsung's Galaxy S5 can also act as a mobile tap and pay credit card for Westpac and Commonwealth Bank customers, plus the fingerprint scanner supports PayPal payments.\n\nThe verdict\n\nThe Samsung Galaxy S5 is an impressive all-rounder with a great camera, but HTC's One M8 has the upper hand in terms of style and might win multimedia fans over with those impressive speakers.\n\nSamsung Galaxy S5\n\n$929\n\nsamsung.com/au\n\nHTC One M8\n\n$899\n\nhtc.com/au", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Digital Life News, Mobiles", "application-name": "The Sydney Morning Herald", "og": {"site_name": "The Sydney Morning Herald", "description": "Samsung and HTC's Android heavyweights stand toe-to-toe - but which one is right for you?", "title": "Android flagship smartphones: Samsung Galaxy S5 v HTC One M8", "url": "http://www.smh.com.au/digital-life/mobiles/android-flagship-smartphones-samsung-galaxy-s5-v-htc-one-m8-20140527-zrplt.html", "image": "http://www.smh.com.au/content/dam/images/z/r/s/i/s/image.related.articleLeadwide.620x349.zrplt.png/1401404594046.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://www.smh.com.au/content/dam/images/z/r/s/i/s/image.related.articleLeadwide.620x349.zrplt.png/1401404594046.jpg"}, "description": "Samsung and HTC's Android heavyweights stand toe-to-toe - but which one is right for you?", "site": "@smh", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Android flagship smartphones: Samsung Galaxy S5 v HTC One M8"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "Open The Sydney Morning Herald", "robots": "ACAP allow-present prohibited-modification=annotation", "fb": {"app_id": 193677504039845}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.smh.com.au", "msapplication-task": "name=Weather;action-uri=http://www.smh.com.au/weather;icon-uri=http://www.smh.com.au/favicon.ico;", "description": "Samsung and HTC's Android heavyweights stand toe-to-toe - but which one is right for you?"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd42cc\"", "article_summary": "Superphones: Samsung's Galaxy S5, left, and the HTC One M8.\nSamsung's Galaxy S5 can also act as a mobile tap and pay credit card for Westpac and Commonwealth Bank customers, plus the fingerprint scanner supports PayPal payments.\nThe difference is barely noticeable, as is the fact that the HTC handset is a fraction taller and thicker.\nSamsung Galaxy S5$929samsung.com/auHTC One M8$899htc.com/au\nThe verdictThe Samsung Galaxy S5 is an impressive all-rounder with a great camera, but HTC's One M8 has the upper hand in terms of style and might win multimedia fans over with those impressive speakers."}
