Chafee believes in standing up for clean air and water, fiscal responsibility and staunchly defending personal liberties. (\u201cIf you\u2019re gonna tap our phones, go get a warrant,\u201d he told me.) He believes government can be a force for good in people\u2019s lives, and he is \u201cvery averse to foreign entanglements and quagmires.\u201d\n\nThat, in a paragraph, is how Lincoln Chafee \u2014 one of the newest entrants to the 2016 presidential race (although, technically, he\u2019s just \u201cconsidering\u201d a run) \u2014 describes his political brand. But, as a Rhode Island journalist with a front-row seat to Chafee\u2019s last few years, I feel compelled to add a few more words: This guy is weird.\n\nChafee isn\u2019t demographically weird, of course. He\u2019s an enormously rich, 62-year-old, Andover-educated white guy who likes to sail. The Chafees were among Rhode Island\u2019s founding families, and as Mother Jones pointed out \u2014 in a post titled \u201cFinally, a Candidate for People Who Think Jeb Bush Isn\u2019t WASPy Enough\u201d \u2014 his \u201cfather, great-great grandfather and great-great uncle all previously served as governor.\u201d Travel around Rhode Island and you\u2019ll see Chafee Hall at the University of Rhode Island, the John H. Chafee Center for International Business at Bryant University, the Pell Chafee Performance Center in Providence and the John H. Chafee Fitness Center at the Newport naval station.\n\nBut none of this precludes Lincoln Chafee from being a strange bird. And I\u2019d wager that his utter quirkiness was the reason a number of folks took his April 9 presidential-candidacy announcement as a belated April Fool\u2019s joke.\n\nChafee is so bereft of polish and charisma that, depending on your viewpoint, he\u2019s either an endearing political Mr. Rogers, or, as Rhody talk-radio shock jock John DePetro tweeted after the announcement, an \u201cincompetent buffoon.\u201d I recently heard one local political consultant compare Chafee\u2019s trademark facial expression to that of a guy telling you that he just ran over your dog. And when things go sour \u2014 as they frequently did during Chafee\u2019s gubernatorial term, which included a hurricane, abysmal employment stats and the collapse of former Red Sox pitcher Curt Schilling\u2019s Providence-based video-game company, 38 Studios, which the state had lent $75 million \u2013 this affect can start to grate. Perhaps there are politicians who can get away with saying \u201cDon\u2019t trust your dealer right now\u201d during a conversation about a fatal overdose crisis. But Chafee isn\u2019t one of them.\n\nBut this is all surface-level, subjective stuff. Let\u2019s talk facts \u2013 which, in Chafee\u2019s case, are fittingly eclectic. He was a professional farrier (someone who shoes horses) for years before entering politics. He\u2019s admitted to tooting a bit of cocaine in college. He was an early advocate of legalizing same-sex marriage in Rhode Island, long before he was able sign the bill making it a reality, in 2013. His approval rating hovered in the 20s during his time in office.\n\nRhode Island recently unveiled Chafee\u2019s official gubernatorial portrait, which features an unusual, midnight-dark background. At the time, the Providence Journal wrote, \u201cLincoln Chafee may best be known as the party-switching politician who stubbornly blazed his own trail whether it landed him in thorns or not. Soon, his image of nonconformity will hang in the State House in perpetuity.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Yeah, this guy is pretty strange", "title": "Meet 2016\u2019s weirdest candidate: The party-switching, O\u2019Reilly-dueling former Governor Lincoln Chafee", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Yeah, this guy is pretty strange", "title": "Meet 2016\u2019s weirdest candidate: The party-switching, O\u2019Reilly-dueling former Governor Lincoln Chafee", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/04/12/meet_2016s_weirdest_candidate_the_party_switching_oreilly_dueling_former_governor_lincoln_chafee/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/04/lincoln_chafee2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Yeah, this guy is pretty strange", "title": "Meet 2016\u2019s weirdest candidate: The party-switching, O\u2019Reilly-dueling former Governor Lincoln Chafee", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/04/lincoln_chafee2.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Philip Eil", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, 2016 Elections, Democratic Party, Lincoln Chafee, Republican Party, rhode island", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcadca\"", "article_summary": "Topics: 2016 Elections, Democratic Party, Lincoln Chafee, Republican Party, rhode island, News, Politics NewsI recently walked away from a lengthy interview with former Rhode Island Governor Lincoln Chafee with a clear idea of how he sees himself.\nAt the time, the Providence Journal wrote, \u201cLincoln Chafee may best be known as the party-switching politician who stubbornly blazed his own trail whether it landed him in thorns or not.\nBut none of this precludes Lincoln Chafee from being a strange bird.\nRhode Island recently unveiled Chafee\u2019s official gubernatorial portrait, which features an unusual, midnight-dark background.\nChafee isn\u2019t demographically weird, of course."}
