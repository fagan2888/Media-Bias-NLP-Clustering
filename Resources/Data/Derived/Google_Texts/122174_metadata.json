McConnell thinks a 2.3 percent tax on manufacturers and importers of medical devices is deeply, deeply unpopular? He thinks a requirement that employers provide insurance for anyone who works more than 30 hours a week is deeply, deeply unpopular? He thinks the individual mandate is deeply, deeply unpopular?\n\nOK, I'll give him the last one. The individual mandate is moderately unpopular. Of course, it's also crucial to the functioning of the law, and McConnell knows perfectly well that Obama won't allow it to be repealed. So that leaves the device tax and the 30-hour rule. The former is mostly opposed by medical device lobbyists, while the latter is mostly opposed by medium-sized businesses who want the ability to cancel health coverage for workers merely by reducing their workweek to 39 hours. My wild guess is that neither of these things is deeply, deeply unpopular with the American people.\n\nBut they are unpopular with interest groups that Republicans care about. So they're on the chopping block.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "Mother Jones Magazine", "og": {"url": "http://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2014/11/mitch-mcconnell-puts-his-finger-pulse-american-people", "site_name": "Mother Jones", "image": "/sites/all/assets/mojo_nomaster.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "Mitch McConnell puts his finger on the pulse of the American people"}, "twitter": {"title": "Mitch McConnell puts his finger on the pulse of the American people", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2014/11/mitch-mcconnell-puts-his-finger-pulse-american-people", "image": {"src": "/sites/all/assets/mojo_nomaster.jpg", "identifier": "/sites/all/assets/mojo_nomaster.jpg"}, "creator": "kdrum", "site": "@MotherJones", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "/sites/all/assets/mstile-70x70.png", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "/sites/all/assets/mstile-310x310.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "/sites/all/assets/mstile-310x150.png", "fb": {"admins": "13301307,670317733,1198876232,38509772,106892,2907757,306289,602422192,4101301,513450539"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/sites/all/assets/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "Congress,Health+Care", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "/sites/all/assets/mstile-150x150.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2703\"", "article_summary": "My wild guess is that neither of these things is deeply, deeply unpopular with the American people.\nMcConnell thinks a 2.3 percent tax on manufacturers and importers of medical devices is deeply, deeply unpopular?\nHe thinks the individual mandate is deeply, deeply unpopular?\nHe thinks a requirement that employers provide insurance for anyone who works more than 30 hours a week is deeply, deeply unpopular?\nOf course, it's also crucial to the functioning of the law, and McConnell knows perfectly well that Obama won't allow it to be repealed."}
