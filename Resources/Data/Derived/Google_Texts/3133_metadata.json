If you\u2019re not familiar, it\u2019s the one that says it\u2019s for less government and actually, really, really means it. The Libertarians would cut social programs, including the popular ones, and they support gun rights. But cutting government also means shrinking the military, and they also would remove government from people\u2019s personal decisions, which means they\u2019d legalize marijuana and end the drug war. The party\u2019s chairman in Arkansas, economist Dr. Michael Pakko, describes the party as a combination of small government constitutionalists, anarchists who want virtually no government, and \u201cminanarchists\u201d who fall somewhere in between.\n\nThe Libertarians this year are running 23 candidates in Arkansas, including likable party veteran Frank Gilbert for U.S. Senate and candidates in all four congressional races: Mark West in the 1st District; Chris Hayes in the 2nd; Steve Isaacson in the 3rd; and Kerry Hicks in the 4th.(Democrats could muster a candidate only in the 2nd District.) Eleven Libertarians are running for the state Legislature. And the party is doing this despite the fact that, under a law passed by Republicans and Democrats, it had to select its candidates a year before the election.\n\nFor Libertarians, this year represents the party\u2019s best hope to ever make a splash. The 2012 presidential candidate, former Republican New Mexico Gov. Gary Johnson, won only 1.5 percent of the vote in Arkansas, but he\u2019s running again and appears to be the party\u2019s likely nominee. A recent Fox News poll showed him with 10 percent support in a hypothetical matchup with Trump and Clinton.\n\nHe won\u2019t get 10 percent. Republicans and Democrats are highly skilled at painting each other as so terrible that many voters will decide they must pick one to save the country from the other. So don\u2019t look for the United States to produce its third President Johnson.\n\nBut if the Libertarian presidential nominee can win 3 percent of the vote in Arkansas, it would be a big win for the state party. That\u2019s the threshold it needs to qualify for the ballot in 2018 without having to collect 10,000 voter signatures, a task that Pakko said cost $34,000 this year as well as a lot of legwork.\n\nHow doable is 3 percent? The Libertarians\u2019 top vote-getter in 2014, Hayes, won 6.36 percent in the treasurer\u2019s race. Some conservative Republicans won\u2019t vote for Trump, and they\u2019re certainly not going to vote for Clinton, so they\u2019re looking for an alternative. Gilbert said some Republicans won\u2019t forgive Gov. Asa Hutchinson and legislative Republicans for Arkansas Works, which is the state program that uses Obamacare dollars to purchase private health insurance for Arkansans with incomes up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level. Meanwhile, maybe the Libertarian nominee could pull votes from disaffected Bernie Sanders supporters who see Clinton as part of the problem. Some Sanders voters will vote for the Green Party candidate, presumably Jill Stein, who won .9 percent of the Arkansas vote in 2012.\n\nIf the Libertarians do win 3 percent, the next question is, so what? Probably the party takes more votes from the Republicans than the Democrats, but that won\u2019t matter in most races in a state as red as this one is becoming. Libertarians are a long way from actually winning races for important offices. The party wants a much smaller government than most Arkansans would support. To win, Libertarians would have to moderate, but if they do that, would they become what they\u2019re fighting against?\n\nFor now, Libertarians, Greens, and other parties offer this \u2013 a choice, one that Mary Anne Noland\u2019s son, who wrote her obituary in honor of her sense of humor, didn\u2019t take into account.\n\nSteve Brawner is an independent journalist in Arkansas.
