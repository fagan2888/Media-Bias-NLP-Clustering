But every state is different. Florida would see a net cost of nearly $11.5 million instead.\n\nSign up for the AARP Money Matters newsletter\n\nOverall, 26 states would see a net savings according to the analysis published in the October issue of the journal Health Affairs, while 22 would end up spending more.\n\nThe program would help seniors who live independently \u2013 except for meals \u2013 to remain in their homes, regardless of whether they are on Medicaid.\n\nThe study provides guidance for state policymakers as they consider the future of their home-delivered meals programs, which are conducted under the Older Americans Act, says Kali Thomas, an assistant professor in the School of Public Health at Brown University. \u201cWe wanted to provide a roadmap for people.\u201d\n\nState by state\n\nTo do the study, Thomas and co-author Vincent Mor, professor of community health, looked at several key pieces of data, including how many seniors in each state receive home-delivered meals and how much it costs each state to provide those meals.\n\nThe researchers also looked at nursing home and Medicaid data to estimate the number of seniors that Medicaid maintains in nursing homes who are \u201clow-care,\u201d meaning they may have the functional capabilities to live at home. Finally they looked at the per diem Medicaid pays in each state for seniors to live in nursing homes.\n\nThe results allowed them to estimate the incremental cost of providing meals to 1 percent more seniors in each state, the number of additional seniors on Medicaid who would no longer need to live in nursing homes, and how much less Medicaid would therefore spend in each state.\n\nAcross the country, the 1 percent expansion would bring meals to 392,594 more seniors at a cost of more than $117 million. Because 1,722 seniors would no longer have to live in nursing homes on Medicaid, total Medicaid savings would total $109 million.\n\nThe reason why the additional food delivery costs outstrip Medicaid savings nationwide, even though most states would save money on a net basis, is that in some very large states with relatively few low-care seniors or relatively low Medicaid per diems, food costs outweighed the resulting Medicaid savings on a relatively large scale.\n\n\u201cIn states like California and Florida where a 1 percent increase in the 65+ population is a lot of people, it will cost those states a lot more to feed them,\u201d Thomas says.\n\nGet discounts on health and wellness products and services with your AARP Member Advantages.\n\n\u201cOur analyses suggest that 26 states with high Medicaid nursing home per diem reimbursement rates, a large proportion of low-care (nursing home residents on Medicaid), and a relatively small population of older adults, could save money,\u201d the authors write.\n\nMore than money\n\nStates projected to lose money can opt to focus their efforts in ways that are more precise than an across-the-board expansion, says Thomas.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not proposing that all states simply increase the proportion of age 65+ receiving meals by 1 percent. But if they were to target these vulnerable people who are at risk for nursing home placement they would likely see more savings. This is a program that has the potential to save states a lot of money if it\u2019s done correctly.\u201d\n\nPolicymakers should consider not only the fiscal implications of providing home-delivered meals, which the study quantifies, but also the impact on individual seniors, Thomas says. \u201cThe quality of life argument is really important, but it\u2019s not been shown, empirically.\u201d\n\nThe National Institute on Aging and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality funded the study.\n\nDavid Orenstein is Science News Officer, Medicine, Life Sciences and Public Health, at Brown University\n\n\n\nPhoto: Katrina Heikkinen/Wikimedia Commons\n\nAlso of Interest\n\nSee the AARP home page for deals, savings tips, trivia and more", "article_metadata": {"page_title": "blog", "twitter": {"description": "By David Orenstein Expanding programs like Meals on Wheels would save 26 of 48 U.S. states money and would allow more seniors to stay in their own homes, research shows.
