The ex-governor and Baptist minister should look at Republicans\u2019 real base\u2014working Americans.\n\nYet the very things that give Huckabee credence with the Republican base may prove to be a hindrance with an electorate that\u2019s growing ever more secular and single, and in which unmarried women now numerically equal regular churchgoers as a voting bloc. Indeed, just last week, a cluster of polls showed that deism is on the upswing in America. (Deism is the belief in a supreme being who is a creator who does not intervene in the universe.) All of this should make any presidential aspirant who would wear his religion on his sleeve step back and take notice.\n\nFor the first time in more than three decades, less than a majority of Americans think of the clergy as ethical or honest, with the numbers showing a stark divide based upon political affiliation. Republicans view the clergy more favorably than do Democrats or independents, and that is no surprise.\n\nBut more disturbing for Huckabee and the GOP is that America\u2019s diminished satisfaction with its religious leaders is not just about errant ministers, priests, and rabbis. Rather, it\u2019s about religion itself.\n\nNowadays, less than three-quarters of Americans believe in God, and even a majority of Catholics reject the idea that God intervenes in daily life. More than a fifth of Americans describe themselves as not at all religious, while fewer than half of Republicans believe in creationism.\n\nAttitudinally, a mainstream politician like New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie can greet these numbers with a shrug, and get on with his campaign and his life. But it\u2019s a challenge for a faith-based candidate like Huckabee, for whom religion is a significant part of his agenda and identity.\n\nGoing forward, if Huckabee\u2019s message is simply about religion, he will have an uphill climb on Election Day, assuming he were to win the Republican nomination. Historically, voters have been uncomfortable with politicians whose religious or regional identities overwhelm their candidacies, with William Jennings Bryan, Al Smith and Jimmy Carter offering the clearest examples. Of the three, Carter was the only one to win and then only by a narrow margin, and he was a one-term wonder.\n\nBryan twice lost to William McKinley, in 1896 and 1900, and then again in 1908, to William Howard Taft. Bryan is best remembered for his \u201cCross of Gold Speech,\u201d in which he made his stand as an economic populist, and for his role at the Scopes trial, in which a Tennessee schoolteacher went to jail for teaching evolution. Bryan aided the prosecution and testified that the flood recorded in the Book of Genesis occurred precisely in 2348 B.C.\n\nSmith, a four-term governor from New York, lost to Republican Herbert Hoover in a landslide after Smith had made \u201cSidewalks of New York\u201d his campaign song, while his opponents battered Smith over his Catholicism. In the end, Smith even failed to carry his home state.\n\nIn 1976, Carter, who was then Georgia\u2019s governor, became the first known born-again Christian to win the presidency. On the trail, Carter repeatedly injected his faith into the race. But even in the aftermath of Watergate, Richard Nixon\u2019s resignation, and Gerald Ford\u2019s pardon of Nixon. Carter won with just 50.8 percent of the popular vote against Ford.\n\nSo what should Huckabee do if he cares about reaching beyond his cultural core? For starters, he should actually take a page from Bryan\u2019s playbook and talk about the concerns of working Americans\u2014the GOP\u2019s base.\n\nHuckabee should deliver a jeremiad lambasting Washington for its role in fostering the housing collapse and the Great Recession. He should hammer home how the government precipitated economic calamity by juicing up the housing market, and turning housing policy into a taxpayer-funded vehicle for vote-buying. And Huckabee should not hesitate to use the recent words of federal judge Jed Rakoff, who was appointed by Bill Clinton to the federal bench to make his point.\n\nIn Rakoff\u2019s telling, \u201cin the year 2000, HUD Secretary Andrew Cuomo increased to 50 percent the percentage of low-income mortgages that the government-sponsored entities known as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were required to purchase, helping to create the conditions that resulted in over half of all mortgages being subprime at the time the housing market began to collapse in 2007.\u201d The judge leaves no doubt as to who is to blame.\n\nStill, playing on resentments has its limits. Criticizing Natalie Portman for first becoming a mother and then a wife\u2014as Huckabee did in 2011\u2014is bad politics. According to the Pew Research Center, single mothers make up one in four households with children under 18; and, as Chris Cilizza of The Washington Post notes, they vote overwhelmingly Democratic.\n\nSo Huckabee needs to show some non-judgmental leg on modernity, and going after Portman is not the way to do it. Instead, he should also talk about launching a war on Alzheimer\u2019s disease, as baby boomers now file through retirement. Just as FDR set in motion the March of Dimes to eradicate polio and Puritan minister Cotton Mather went after smallpox in early 18th-century Boston, Huckabee should make eliminating this malady a stated priority. If 2012 teaches the Republicans anything, it is that simply bashing Obamacare is not enough to get you to the White House.", "article_metadata": {"twitter": {"site": "@thedailybeast", "card": "summary"}, "keywords": "Republican Party, u.s. poli, Mike Huckabee, Republican primary, 2016", "publicationDate": 201312241045, "wrap": "/content/dailybeast/politics", "description": "How can the pious candidate pivot when polls show voters shifting away from religion?
