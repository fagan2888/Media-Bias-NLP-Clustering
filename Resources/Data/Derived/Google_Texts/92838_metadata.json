Instead, Gray struggled though just two-thirds of an inning, giving up seven runs (six earned) on four hits and a walk. The killer blow was a three-run homer by opposing pitcher Jake Arrieta.\n\nThe Rockies slogged through their worst performance of the spring, getting roasted 18-4 and giving up 21 hits to the Cubs.\n\n\u201cI would rather have a bad game the first outing, but it can\u2019t always be that way,\u201d Gray said. \u201cThis was unfortunate, but it\u2019s all about how you respond. I\u2019ve responded well in the past, and I think I will be able to again.\u201d\n\nIt didn\u2019t help Gray\u2019s cause that second baseman Charlie Culberson and catcher Michael McKenry both committed errors, or that Gray misplayed two bunts in front of the mound that allowed two Chicago runs to score.\n\n\u201cI was just going too fast,\u201d he said of the bobbled bunts. \u201cI didn\u2019t tell myself I had time. I didn\u2019t do what I practice. I panicked, went way too fast for myself and bobbled the ball. I\u2019ve got to settle it down out there. That can\u2019t happen.\u201d\n\nManager Walt Weiss is looking for poised performances from his starters and Gray\u2019s meltdown on Saturday didn\u2019t help his cause to make the rotation.\n\nStill, Weiss downplayed Gray\u2019s bad outing.\n\n\u201cWe made it tough on him, and I think he made it tough on himself with a couple of bunts back to him,\u201d Weiss said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t play well behind him. We looked up and he was 40 pitches in, and you don\u2019t want that in the first inning. So we got him out of there.\u201d\n\nWhat did Weiss say to Gray after such a bad performance?\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s come a long way and he\u2019s had a great spring,\u201d Weiss said. \u201cAgain, it was a really strange inning. Unfortunately, he couldn\u2019t go past one inning. But it\u2019s one of many, many he\u2019s going to throw.\u201d\n\nHits\n\nThe positive moments were few and far between. Former closer Rafael Betancourt, trying to make the roster at age 39, threw a scoreless inning, though he allowed two hits.\n\nUtility player Matt McBride, who\u2019s had a good spring but who\u2019s unlikely to make the 25-man roster, hit a two-run homer, his second of the spring.\n\nMisses\n\nLeft fielder Corey Dickerson departed the game after the second inning with a tight lower back. He said his back and hamstrings tightened up while he was standing in the the outfield during the first two long innings. Dickerson was scheduled to travel to Mexico Sunday to play in the Rockies\u2019 split-squad game against Arizona, but the condition of his back might keep him out of Sunday\u2019s game.\n\nMinor-league pitcher Nelson Gonzalez, called on to relieve Gray, got rocked for three runs on five hits in his one inning of work.\n\nRight-handed reliever Scott Oberg, a darkhorse candidate to make the bullpen, did not help is cause. He gave up two runs on three hits in two-thirds of an inning.\n\nLefty reliever Rex Brothers continues to run hot and cold. His spring ERA stands a 9.45 after he gave up a run on two hits in his inning of work. He uncorked a wild pitch to allow the run to score. \u201cHe\u2019s been good, with a lot of positive signs from Rex this spring,\u201d Weiss said. \u201cThe last couple of times it\u2019s gotten away from his a little bit. I think the key for him is just not grinding so much when it starts to get away; just relax and reel it in a little bit. He\u2019s such a competitive guy that sometimes he grinds himself into the dirt. He has to relax out there.\u201d\n\nUp Next\n\nThe Rockies play two games Sunday as they begin their final week of Cactus League play. One squad travels to Hermosillo, Mexico to face the Diamondbacks in a 2:10 p.m. (MDT) game. Right-hander Christian Bergman is scheduled to start that game. Arizona starts right-hander Aaron Blair.\n\nThe Rockies also play the Diamondbacks at Salt River Fields in a 2:10 p.m. game (MDT). Right-hander Jordan Lyles gets the start opposite Rubby De La Rosa. The game will be televised on Root Sports.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Corey Dickerson,Jon Gray,Matt McBride,Rex Brothers", "language": "en, sv", "og": {"site_name": "On the Rox", "description": "The expression on Jon Gray's face and the tenor of his tired voice told the story of the difficult day.", "title": "Jon Gray, Rockies' top prospect, struggles in rout by Cubs", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/rockies/2015/03/28/jon-gray-rockies-top-prospect-struggles-in-rout-by-cubs/19721/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/rockies/files/2014/11/451225578-495x329.jpg", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "description": "The expression on Jon Gray's face and the tenor of his tired voice told the story of the difficult day.", "creator": "@psaundersdp", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/rockies/2015/03/28/jon-gray-rockies-top-prospect-struggles-in-rout-by-cubs/19721/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/rockies/files/2014/11/451225578-495x329.jpg", "title": "Jon Gray, Rockies\u2019 top prospect, struggles in rout by Cubs", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "The expression on Jon Gray's face and the tenor of his tired voice told the story of the difficult day."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0bef\"", "article_summary": "He has to relax out there.\u201dUp NextThe Rockies play two games Sunday as they begin their final week of Cactus League play.\n\u201cHe\u2019s been good, with a lot of positive signs from Rex this spring,\u201d Weiss said.\nThe Rockies slogged through their worst performance of the spring, getting roasted 18-4 and giving up 21 hits to the Cubs.\n\u201cHe\u2019s come a long way and he\u2019s had a great spring,\u201d Weiss said.\nInstead, Gray struggled though just two-thirds of an inning, giving up seven runs (six earned) on four hits and a walk."}
