The firm manages tech services for Canada's national health service and has received more than $1.4 billion in consulting fees from the U.S. during Obama's presidency. CGI, which is headquartered in Montreal, continues to receive tens of millions in new awards from the U.S. government even after the botched Obamacare web launch.\n\nThe fundamental pitfalls of the state-driven Canadian system are that it bleeds money and is hobbled by long waiting lines. Health costs jumped 53 percent over the last decade, and the country faces a funding shortfall of more than half a trillion dollars, according to the Fraser Institute, a Canadian think tank.\n\nFurthermore, ever-growing budgets haven't improved access to care. \u201cThe 2013 median waiting time of 18.2 weeks is about three days longer than 2012, and substantially longer than 1993 when it was just 9.3 weeks,\u201d reports Fraser.\n\nHarper introduced a new funding model and creeping competition to address some of the problems. To cut waiting times, private providers are allowed to take overflow patients from overburdened public facilities and can accept customers willing to pay extra for private service. This is a small step, but it re-introduces the practice of private care to the nation.\n\nTo improve the balance sheet, Canada's conservative government is pegging spending to economic growth. For the past 10 years, Ottawa automatically increased the disbursements it sent to provincial governments by 6 percent every year. Strings-free block grants are used to encourage greater local experimentation and customization of care without muddling federal standardization.\n\nDemographic trends provide the impetus for change. \u201cThere is a major shift in thinking around health care with the generations after baby boomers in Canada,\u201d explains Alise Mills, a political strategist and commentator in Vancouver.\n\n\u201cYounger Canadians are asking how we can deliver better health care knowing the funding is unsustainable. It\u2019s more than just moving pieces around the table; it\u2019s a slow crawl to the inevitable.\u201d\n\nNobody is saying Canada will scrap universal care any time soon, but Harper\u2019s decentralization is seen as an important first step in bringing about more private health care options.\n\n\u201cHealth care used to be the third rail in Canadian politics: Touch it, and you will die,\u201d Michael Taube, a former speechwriter to the prime minister, tells the Washington Examiner. \u201cNow, many Canadians desire more choice and freedom and would be content to have greater access to more doctors, hospitals, MRI clinics, diagnostics procedures and so forth.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "As the U.S. debates ways to replace or improve Obamacare, Canada may offer a blueprint for reform.
