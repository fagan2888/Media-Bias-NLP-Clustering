An ACO is a group of hospitals, physicians or other health care providers that agree to manage care, share savings and improve quality for a minimum of 5,000 Medicare patients in a contract with the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.\n\n\n\nWhy were ACOs created and how many are there? ACOs are creations of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010. They are part of an effort by Medicare to reduce rising health care costs by providing incentives for hospitals, physicians and other providers to coordinate care and reduce service duplication and unnecessary visits to the hospital and emergency department. From late 2011 to 2014, Medicare contracted with 353 ACOs nationally with 7.5 million Medicare beneficiaries, or 15 percent of the total number of 50 million beneficiaries. There are 1.7 million Medicare beneficiaries in Michigan, the sixth-most of any state. Michigan's 12 ACOs care for about 266,000 Medicare patients.\n\nMichigan's 12 accountable care organizations fared better than national averages in saving Medicare money, generating profits of their own and improving quality, according to data for 2014 from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and interviews with ACO executives.\n\n\n\nWhile only 32 percent, or 112, of the nation's 353 ACOs saved enough money for Medicare to earn profits last year on the Obamacare program, half of the 12 ACOs based in Michigan made money, accounting for $42.6 million or 10 percent of the total $422 million kept for its owners.\n\n\n\nMichigan's 12 ACOs \u2014 including the Detroit Medical Center's Michigan Pioneer ACO, the state's only full-risk ACO \u2014 cared for about 266,000 Medicare beneficiaries.\n\n\n\nOverall, Medicare ACOs saved Medicare nearly $926 million in 2014, a higher number than the previous two years of the three-year demonstration program, which has been renewed for another three years until 2018.\n\n\n\nQuality also rose in 28 of 33 measurements, including depression screening, medication reconciliation, colorectal cancer screening and blood-sugar levels.\n\n\n\nStill, Medicare savings accounted for only a 1 percent reduction based on the $600 billion spent on Medicare in 2014 for its 50 million beneficiaries. Some critics have used that small amount of savings to attack the program, which was authorized under the Affordable Care Act of 2010.\n\n\n\n\"It is important to put those criticisms into context,\" said Roger Wiseman, president of Michigan Pioneer and DMC's senior vice president for population health. \"You have to remind people of the growth curve of health care expenditures. Doing nothing was not an option.\"\n\n\n\nIn 2014, Michigan Pioneer ACO saved $17 million during its third year and kept $10 million. In 2013, Michigan Pioneer saved $14 million and kept $6 million.\n\n\n\nDMC is part of for-profit Tenet Health, a Dallas-based chain with 81 hospitals in the U.S. and United Kingdom.\n\n\n\n\n\nHow ACOs operate\n\nACO experts tell Crain's that the key to savings and quality improvement is simple: Increase access to physicians, coordinate care with hospitals and specialty doctors and reduce unnecessary services outside of physician offices. Care at the right time and in the right place can lead to fewer visits to urgent care, emergency rooms and hospitalizations, they say.\n\n\n\nIn Southeast Michigan, for example, Dearborn-based Oakwood ACO LLC saved Medicare $19 million and kept $8.1 million for a $13,000-per-member average in its second program year in 2014 with an 87 percent quality score.\n\n\n\nIn 2013, Oakwood ACO saved Medicare $17 million and kept $8.4 million.\n\n\n\n\"We have been continuing to refine what we put into place initially,\" said Bill Isenstein, Oakwood ACO's executive director and COO, adding: \"We look daily to see what's happening with ER visits and hospital admissions. We reach out to patients, jointly with primary care physicians, to get them on track so they are better managed.\"\n\n\n\nUnlike many ACOs, Oakwood ACO also is the insurance network organization for Oakwood Healthcare, which is the parent company. Oakwood ACO also manages the parent's other insurance contracts, including commercial and Medicare Advantage managed care enrollees.\n\n\n\nIsenstein said Oakwood ACO manages care for 120,000 people, including 14,300 in its Medicare ACO.\n\n\n\nWiseman said Michigan Pioneer's success has been driven by tactics including the coordination of patient services.\n\n\n\n\"We identify those patients who had the highest need and provide resources and guide those patients to the services they need,\" Wiseman said.\n\n\n\n\n\nRegion's ACOs score well\n\nReliance ACO, a Farmington Hills-based organization, saved Medicare more than $12 million in 2014 and kept $5.9 million for a $12,600-per-member savings average. The ACO is composed of dozens of physicians and other providers in Southeast Michigan and works with hospitals representing most of the major health systems in the region.\n\n\n\nThe Physician Organization of Michigan ACO, sponsored by University of Michigan Health System, its affiliated medical group IHA and 11 other physician organizations, saved Medicare $27 million, with $12 million retained by the ACO, saving $8,800 per member. About 122,000 Medicare enrollees participated with 6,300 providers.\n\n\n\nLast year, UM Health System became one of 12 ACOs to drop out of the Pioneer ACO program to become a shared savings ACO. UM was one of the original participants in ACOs, dating back 10 years, when it participated in the physician group practice demonstration program.\n\n\n\nAs the only remaining Pioneer ACO in Michigan, Wiseman said, Michigan Pioneer has applied to Medicare for two more years as either a Pioneer ACO or a next-generation ACO.\n\n\n\nThe two other ACOs in Michigan to earn money under the ACO program in 2014 were physician-led ACOs: Flint-based Greater Genesee County ACO LLC, which saved $4.2 million and earned $2.1 million for a per-member average of $9,600, and The Accountable Care Organization Ltd. of Farmington Hills, which saved $9 million and earned $4.4 million for an $11,400 per-member average.\n\n\n\nOther ACOs in the shared savings program in Michigan include United Outstanding Physicians Southeast Michigan Accountable Care, Accountable Healthcare Alliance PC, St. John Providence Partners in Care, Northern Michigan Health Network and Accountable Healthcare Alliance PC.\n\n\n\nLast year, another Pioneer ACO, Genesys ACO in Grand Blanc, dropped out of the program, owing Medicare $1.9 million.\n\n\n\nJay Greene: (313) 446-0325.
