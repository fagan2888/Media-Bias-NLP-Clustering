Stateline is a nonpartisan, nonprofit news service of the Pew Charitable Trusts that provides daily reporting and analysis on trends in state policy.\n\nThe federal-state Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) will run out of money on Sept. 30. Until recently, Congress showed little interest in paying for it. But this week, the House agreed on a bill that would continue the $13 billion program in its current form through 2017.\n\nIn late February, Republicans in both houses issued a \u201cdiscussion draft\u201d outlining modifications they claimed would make the program more flexible for states, even though most governors say they don\u2019t want any changes to what they consider a near-perfect health care program. The GOP proposal would have narrowed coverage to the lowest-income families currently served by CHIP and allowed states to cut back enrollment.\n\nIf CHIP is not renewed, advocates say more than 2 million of the 8 million kids currently covered by the program could wind up uninsured.\n\nHundreds of advocacy groups and Democrats in Congress spoke out against the changes. For now, the GOP proposal has been taken off the table under a compromise deal agreed to by House Republicans. The issue now is whether to extend the program for two years or four years. The Obama administration, Senate Democrats, advocates for children and nearly all governors are pushing for at least a four-year continuation, through 2019.\n\nBut an independent advisory board to Congress, known as the Medicaid and CHIP Payment and Access Commission, and some Republicans want to limit the renewal period.\n\nCreated for Children\n\nCHIP was designed to cover kids in families with incomes too high to qualify for Medicaid but too low to afford private insurance. The Affordable Care Act extended CHIP through 2019 and increased its federal funding share by 23 percent.\n\nBut the health law also created health insurance exchange subsidies aimed at helping families in the same income brackets as those served by CHIP. To avoid redundancy, some argue CHIP should eventually be discontinued in favor of exchange policies or employer-sponsored insurance. Dissolving CHIP would also simplify things for families who may have other members covered by Medicaid or private insurance, they argue.\n\n\u201cThere is a legitimate policy concern that, if not properly focused, CHIP coverage may unduly crowd out private health coverage,\u201d U.S. Rep. Fred Upton, the Michigan Republican who chairs the House Energy and Commerce Committee, said during a December hearing. Upton\u2019s concern is that families who qualify for exchange subsidies or have employer-sponsored coverage would instead opt for CHIP at greater expense to the federal government.\n\nProponents of maintaining CHIP argue that the subsidized policies offered on exchanges today are inferior to CHIP coverage. Substantially higher out-of-pocket expenses make the policies unaffordable for many CHIP families, and the benefits packages and provider networks are designed for adults, not children.\n\nAccording to the American Academy of Pediatrics, CHIP plans provide access to pediatric primary care physicians, pediatric subspecialists and pediatric surgical specialists who are experts at addressing children\u2019s needs.\n\nIn addition, an apparent glitch in the health law bars families who are unable to afford employer-sponsored insurance from receiving premium tax subsidies. The ACA requires employers to provide \u201caffordable\u201d coverage only for workers as individuals, not for their families. If an affordable policy is offered, the worker and his family do not qualify for premium tax subsidies.\n\nFor individuals, under the ACA the cost of a policy may not exceed 9.5 percent of a worker\u2019s income. But there is no limit to what employees can be charged for family coverage, which typically costs nearly three times as much as individual coverage. That leaves low-income families nowhere to go except Medicaid or CHIP.\n\nBipartisan Support\n\nSince its enactment by bipartisan vote in 1997, CHIP has been instrumental in cutting the nation\u2019s uninsured rate for children, from 15 percent in 1997 to 9 percent in 2012. Administered by states and funded primarily by the federal government, CHIP enjoys wide support from Democrats and Republicans at the state and federal level. Republican Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah, a co-sponsor of the GOP discussion draft, called CHIP a \u201cmarvelous\u201d program that has \u201cworked very, very well,\u201d in recent comments to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.\n\nBased on governors\u2019 responses to a recent congressional inquiry, there is very little states want to change about CHIP. Of the 39 governors who responded, only two\u2014Republicans Bill Haslam of Tennessee and Nathan Deal of Georgia\u2014wanted a renewal to be limited to two years. Democratic Gov. Dannel Malloy of Connecticut and Republican Gov. Dennis Daugaard of South Dakota wanted an indefinite renewal period. Gov. Sam Brownback of Kansas and Gov. Rick Snyder of Michigan, both Republicans, wanted a five-year extension. Democratic Gov. Pat Quinn of Illinois, who has since been replaced by Republican Bruce Rauner, also asked for a five-year renewal.\n\nThe National Governors Association, which represents all governors, urged Congress to renew funding for CHIP as soon as possible so they could include it in their budgets for fiscal year 2016, which starts July 1 for most states.\n\nWhy extend CHIP for only two years, when previous renewal periods have been four years? Supporters of a shorter renewal period argue that exchange insurance coverage under the Affordable Care Act is likely to improve over the next two years and Congress will have time to fix the so-called \u201cfamily glitch\u201d that prevents low-income working families from getting premium tax subsidies.\n\nBut Bruce Lesley, president of First Focus, a children\u2019s advocacy group, said \u201cthere is no evidence today that Congress would make the needed changes.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been asking for (CHIP) renewal for more than a year. If we kick it down the road two years, then in nine months we\u2019ll be back here having this discussion all over again,\u201d Lesley said.\n\nIf the two-year extension bill passes the House, the action will move to the Senate where every Democrat supports a four-year extension. The plan is to attach a CHIP reauthorization bill to a larger health care bill, a repeal of the so-called Sustainable Growth Rate method of reimbursing Medicare providers. That bill is expected to be introduced next week and a vote is expected before April 1.\n\nAlso on HuffPost: Health Care Reform Efforts Throughout History Health Care Reform Efforts Throughout History\n\n1 of 17 1912 Former President Theodore Roosevelt champions national health insurance as he unsuccessfully tries to ride his progressive Bull Moose Party back to the White House.
