If Americans wondered what drove the man who, with Heritage Foundation president and teabag leader Jim DeMint, masterminded the $24 billion government shutdown and credit default crisis, all they need to know is that Ted Cruz did not fall far from his father\u2019s evangelical tree.\n\nCruz\u2019s Cuban-born immigrant and rabid Dominionist father illuminates the ideology that drives his son\u2019s lunacy and steadfast will to transform America. Teddy-boy regularly deploys his dad as surrogate to speak on his behalf and dutifully espouse Ted\u2019s political stance to teabaggers, evangelical activists, and extremist conservatives. The elder Cruz tells his son\u2019s devotees that \u201cthe wicked are ruling the United States, \u201cdeath panels are in ObamaCare,\u201d government will \u201ctake all your money and confiscate our fortunes,\u201d \u201cSocial justice is a cancer,\u201d and that \u201cDemocrats promote everything contrary to the word of God.\u201d Preacher Cruz also claimed America is a Christian nation and the Declaration of Independence and Constitution \u201cwere divine revelations from God,\u201d and that \u201cAmerica was formed to honor the word of God.\u201d A few months earlier, Rafael Cruz told teabaggers that President Obama is an \u201coutright Marxist seeking to destroy all concept of God\u201d and urged them to send him \u201cback to Kenya.\u201d\n\nAlthough the main-stream media kept it from the public, it turns out that Ted Cruz, like his father, is driven by religion and likely believes Christian true believers like him were \u201canointed by God to take dominion of every area of society, education, government, and economics.\u201d An ally of elder Cruz predicted that because god got Canadian-Ted elected, \u201cGod will begin to rule and reign. Not Washington, God\u2019s people and his kingdom will begin to rule and reign. I know that\u2019s why God got Rafael\u2019s son elected.\u201d It should not be a surprise, then, that when Cruz directed the Republican Party to shut down the government and threaten an economic catastrophe; he said it was because it was god\u2019s will.\n\nClaiming to know god\u2019s will is an affliction most evangelical fanatics suffer, and claiming to know god\u2019s will is all well and good in private, but when it drives the leader of the Republican Party and the movement intent on Christian domination it presents a clear danger to all Americans. Cruz\u2019s remarks that his supplication to god were answered with a government shutdown order were not meant to pander to the religious right for electoral support, and when he said he sees \u201ca particular susceptibility for candidates to be like Pharisees who wear their faith on their sleeve as convenient political garb,\u201d he is not referring to himself. In fact he said \u201cIt is far better to let actions speak louder than words\u201d and by all indications Cruz\u2019s actions are likely founded in evangelical fundamentalism and Dominionism as much as they are \u201cconservative purity.\u201d\n\nDominionists are more likely than not to work behind the scenes and infiltrate every aspect of American society including government so they can transform America into a nation ruled over by conservative Christians and their understanding of biblical law. It is theocracy and theonomy that advocates the bible\u2019s Mosaic Law as the basis of America\u2019s government. In fact, last Friday a group of conservative Christian activists compared Ted Cruz to Jesus Christ that elicited a chorus of \u201camens\u201d from the Iowa Republicans gathered to cheer on their new messiah. One conservative Christian activist, Steve Scheffler, thanked god for Cruz because he engineered the 16-day government shutdown and prayed for more conservatives like Cruz who were willing to \u201cbe crucified for their belief system.\u201d It is likely the fundamentalists also thanked god for directing Ted to shut down the government and answering his prayers; even if it was a short-lived shut down.\n\nTed Cruz is not his father, but understanding Rafael (dad) is to understand Ted, his ideology, desires, and long-term goals for America as the de facto leader of the Republican Party. It is no coincidence that like Ted, Rafael Cruz goes around the country telling supporters that \u201cWe\u2019ve had enough compromise\u2026enough of Establishment Republicans that don\u2019t stand for anything,\u201d and that it is crucial to their American transformation to \u201celect constitutional conservatives to retake the Senate.\u201d It is important to remember that constitutional conservative is code for fundamentalists who believe that god gave the Founding Fathers the Constitution to \u201cform this nation to honor the word of God.\u201d\n\nSkeptics may conclude that Ted Cruz has not deemed himself the \u201canointed messiah\u201d to lead Dominionist to take control of America, but he has not denied or made any effort to tone down his father\u2019s assertions. In fact, he has no problem sending his father to speak in his stead and claim the United States is a Christian nation, Obamacare is death panels, social justice is a cancer, President Obama hates god, or that the \u201cwicked\u201d are in charge in Washington that all perfectly inform Ted\u2019s extreme conservatism and Christian fundamentalism that make him the archetype of evangelical teabaggers.\n\nAmericans are already suffering from the inordinate influence evangelical extremists wield over the government at the state and federal level. There is, unfortunately, a large movement afoot injecting Christianity into every aspect of society and the last thing this country needs is the leader of one of the major political parties gaining any more power than he already has. It was bad enough that Cruz successfully shut down the government, cost the people $24 billion and over half-a-point growth in GDP, but the fact that he prayed for, and believes he won, god\u2019s will to achieve his goal is something that should make American people recoil in outrage. Unfortunately, with a media beholden to protect conservative Christians at all cost, the people will only learn of Cruz and his appeal to god\u2019s will after Dominionists control the government, replace the Constitution with the bible, and declare with certainty that America is indeed a Christian nation; something the Founding Fathers denied at the nation\u2019s founding.", "article_metadata": {"description": "If Americans wondered what drove the man who masterminded the $24 billion government shutdown all they need to know is that Ted Cruz did not fall far from his father's evangelical tree.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "author": "Rmuse", "og": {"site_name": "Politicus USA", "description": "If Americans wondered what drove the man who masterminded the $24 billion government shutdown all they need to know is that Ted Cruz did not fall far from his father's evangelical tree.", "title": "Bad Apple Ted Cruz Didn't Fall Far From His Father's Equally Rotten Tree", "url": "http://www.politicususa.com/2013/11/02/bad-apple-ted-cruz-fell-fathers-equally-rotten-tree.html", "image": "http://15130-presscdn-0-89.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Cruz-jesus.jpg", "updated_time": "2013-11-02T16:24:05+00:00", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 523732690, "app_id": 113462415332922, "pages": 186473214703370}, "keywords": "Featured News,Apostolic Church,biblical law,Christian fundamentalism,Christianity,Dominionism,fundamentalism,Heritage Foundation,Jesus Christ,preacher,Rafael Cruz,Religious nationalism,Republican Party,Ted Cruz,Theocracy,politicususa,liberal,politics,sarah jones,jason easley,barack obama,hillary clinton,bernie sanders,msnbc,media", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/PoliticusUSA", "section": "Featured News", "published_time": "2013-11-02T16:20:04+00:00", "modified_time": "2013-11-02T16:24:05+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Apostolic Church, biblical law, Christian fundamentalism, Christianity, Dominionism, fundamentalism, Heritage Foundation, Jesus Christ, preacher, Rafael Cruz, Religious nationalism, Republican Party, Ted Cruz, Theocracy"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc93de\"", "article_summary": "Ted Cruz is not his father, but understanding Rafael (dad) is to understand Ted, his ideology, desires, and long-term goals for America as the de facto leader of the Republican Party.\nIn fact, last Friday a group of conservative Christian activists compared Ted Cruz to Jesus Christ that elicited a chorus of \u201camens\u201d from the Iowa Republicans gathered to cheer on their new messiah.\nIf Americans wondered what drove the man who, with Heritage Foundation president and teabag leader Jim DeMint, masterminded the $24 billion government shutdown and credit default crisis, all they need to know is that Ted Cruz did not fall far from his father\u2019s evangelical tree.\nCruz\u2019s Cuban-born immigrant and rabid Dominionist father illuminates the ideology that drives his son\u2019s lunacy and steadfast will to transform America.\nAmericans are already suffering from the inordinate influence evangelical extremists wield over the government at the state and federal level."}
