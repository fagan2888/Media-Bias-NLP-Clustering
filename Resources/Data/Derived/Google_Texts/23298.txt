"I do think that over the next couple of years, the increasing penalties will have a noticeable effect on enrollment."

Counihan and other officials have been pointing out that Obamacare penalties for going without insurance are rising this year. But it's not clear, as yet, whether that message is being heard by the uninsured.

"It's not top of the mind for most people," Levitt said.

"The penalty is only effective if people know about it," said Levitt. "If people go on HealthCare.gov now, they can find out how much the insurance costs them. But it's less obvious what the penalty is for remaining uncovered."

The penalty for not having health coverage in 2015 is the higher of $325 per adult, or 2 percent of adjusted household income. People who didn't have coverage this year, and who did not qualify for an exemption from the fine, will pay the penalty when they file their income tax returns in early 2016.

The penalty is set to rise in 2016 to the higher of $695 per adult, or 2.5 percent of household income. But, again, the penalty will come due only during the 2016 tax filing season, which begins in early 2017.
