It's not a zombie apocalypse, but it's something!\n\nIn this clip, we learn about how one patient's vomiting jag rips apart the carotid patchwork on his throat. The result is one big mess that may not be possible to fix. There's a storm in town, and the small hospital isn't equipped to help this guy, who's too unstable to move. His I.V. has come out, the nurse can't find a vein, and he's going into shock. It's a nail biter, but I'm hopeful, aren't you?\n\n\n\nWill you be watching \"Untold Stories of the ER\"?", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Untold Stories of the ER", "og": {"site_name": "HitFix", "description": "Watch what happens when a man's stitches blow", "title": "Exclusive clip: It's raining blood on 'Untold Stories of the ER'", "url": "http://www.hitfix.com/starr-raving/exclusive-clip-its-raining-blood-on-untold-stories-of-the-er", "image": "http://cdn.hitfix.com/photos/4327848/Untold-Stories-of-the-ER.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "HitFix.com", "description": "Watch this exclusive clip from \"Untold Stories of the ER\" (Fri.
