Quinnipiac surveyed 1,262 Colorado voters from November 11-15 and discovered they want anyone but her.\n\nThe former Secretary of State\u2019s favorability numbers, the poll finds, are worse than Donald Trump\u2019s. She has a negative 33-61 percent favorable rating, compared to Trump's negative of 34-58 percent. Her honesty numbers are even less flattering. While 30 percent of Coloradoans say Clinton is honest, 67 percent say they don\u2019t trust her.\n\n\"A chilly if not frigid reception for former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in her second quest for the White House,\" said Tim Malloy, assistant director of the Quinnipiac University Poll.\n\nHer marks only get worse from there. When paired against the Republican candidates, Clinton loses soundly each time.\n\nColorado voters back any leading Republican contender over Clinton by wide margins: Rubio over Clinton 52 - 36 percent; Carson leads Clinton 52 - 38 percent; Cruz tops Clinton 51 - 38 percent; Trump beats Clinton 48 - 37 percent.\n\nMeanwhile, Colorado voters have saved their warm welcome for Republican Ben Carson. He not only received a quarter of the vote in the general election survey, but he gets a positive trustworthy rating of 57 percent.\n\nColorado's distrust of Clinton is evident of the nation as a whole. Her changing story regarding her use of private server during her tenure as secretary of state is largely why voters gave her her lowest honesty score ever this August, a mere 34 percent, and most people chose \"liar\" when asked what word best describes her.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Hillary gets cold shoulder in key swing state..05/27/2016 8:29:34AM EST.", "author": "Cortney O'Brien", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Hillary gets cold shoulder in key swing state.", "title": "Quinnipiac: Voters Give Hillary a 'Chilly' Reception in Colorado", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/cortneyobrien/2015/11/18/qunnipiac-voters-give-hillary-a-chilly-reception-n2082488", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2015/321/2015-11-17T173203Z_1_LYNXNPEBAG11F_RTROPTP_3_USA-ELECTION.JPG", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "Hillary gets cold shoulder in key swing state.", "title": "Quinnipiac: Voters Give Hillary a 'Chilly' Reception in Colorado", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/cortneyobrien/2015/11/18/qunnipiac-voters-give-hillary-a-chilly-reception-n2082488", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2015/321/2015-11-17T173203Z_1_LYNXNPEBAG11F_RTROPTP_3_USA-ELECTION.JPG", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Quinnipiac: Voters Give Hillary a 'Chilly' Reception in Colorado, Cortney O'Brien, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "While 30 percent of Coloradoans say Clinton is honest, 67 percent say they don\u2019t trust her.\nQuinnipiac surveyed 1,262 Colorado voters from November 11-15 and discovered they want anyone but her.\n\"A chilly if not frigid reception for former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in her second quest for the White House,\" said Tim Malloy, assistant director of the Quinnipiac University Poll.\nMeanwhile, Colorado voters have saved their warm welcome for Republican Ben Carson.\nA key swing state is giving Hillary Clinton the cold shoulder."}
