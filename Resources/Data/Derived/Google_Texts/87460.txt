Some on the right lately have denounced Florida Sen. Marco Rubio as the Republican establishment’s presidential nomination Plan B, now that Jeb Bush has fizzled. One Miami-based conservative activist dismisses Rubio as a “white Republican Obama.”

How absurd. Rubio is not Bob Dole with palm trees. And, if Rubio is a “moderate,” as rival candidate Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas claims, then Sen. John McCain is Ho Chi Minh.

How soon we forget: Marco Rubio was a 2010 Tea Party pinup. He was endorsed by the devoutly anti-establishment Club for Growth. Rather than grow a RINO horn, Rubio reliably votes with the Right. The American Conservative Union gave Rubio a 96 rating (out of 100) for 2014 and a 98 across his Senate career. Heritage Action handed Rubio a score of 94 last year and 91 lifetime. The equivalent Club for Growth numbers are 92 and 93.

These sparkling right-wing credentials notwithstanding, Rubio works and plays well enough with others to enact conservative legislation – sometimes with Democratic support.

• Rubio and Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., co-sponsored the Hezbollah International Financing Prevention Act. This law limits the Iranian-backed terrorist group’s access to global financial markets and punishes banks that serve this band of killers.

• Rubio torpedoed President Obama’s planned bailout of his health insurance cronies who lose money on Obamacare. So far, Rubio has saved taxpayers some $2.5 billion and prevented insurers from socializing their Obamacare losses. Rubio’s low-key amendment to the 2014 omnibus spending bill looks like the thumbtack that slowly will give Obamacare a flat tire.

• In light of the Department of Veteran Affairs’ appalling and deadly neglect of America’s vets, Rubio sponsored legislation to make it easier for the VA secretary to fire incompetent and corrupt bureaucrats whose sloth actually has killed sick veterans as they awaited medical care.

• Rubio and Democratic Sens. Robert Menendez of New Jersey and Bill Nelson of Florida were original sponsors of a December 2014 law that condemns and tightens sanctions on Venezuela’s Castroite tyranny.

Ted Cruz is also an approved hero of the Tea Party and Club for Growth with sky-high conservative scores. Alas, Cruz’s go-it-alone style has limited his effectiveness in passing legislation. Cruz’s Senate website cites just one piece of legislation that he has guided into law: a 2014 statute barring entry visas to U.N. ambassadors who have committed espionage or terrorism against America or who threaten U.S. national security.

Also telling: Among those who work closely with both of these men, three Republican senators have endorsed Rubio – Montana’s Steve Daines, Colorado’s Cory Gardner and Idaho’s James Risch. In contrast, none of Cruz’s Senate colleagues recommends him for president.

Rubio has raised suspicions for initially co-sponsoring comprehensive immigration reform, nicknamed “amnesty.” However, Rubio abandoned the bill once it metastasized into a 1,198-page monstrosity.

The affable Marco Rubio votes with conservatives more than 90 percent of the time and even gets Democrats to back his reforms. What a moderate.
