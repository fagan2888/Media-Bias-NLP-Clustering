(David R. Jennings / Broomfield Enterprise)\n\nThe protest took place just as a 12-hour ceasefire was expiring in the Gaza Strip. More than 100 bodies were recovered across Gaza during the ceasefire, bringing the Palestinian death toll to more than 1,000.\n\n\"These are war crimes going on,\" Bninski said. \"You can't just bomb the hell out of people.\"\n\nDan Winters, a Veterans for Peace member, said his stay in Gaza in 2009 left him angered by the violence that civilians there are regularly subjected to.\n\n\"They just feel totally trapped. Building after building after building was destroyed. They didn't have clean water. Sanitation was shot,\" he said.\n\nWinters and many others at Saturday's protest said their frustration was equally driven by the United States' support of Israel's military.\n\n\"We are implicated. Our tax money implicates us in these war crimes,\" said Frederick's Ida Audeh, whose mother lives near the Palestinian city of Ramallah.\n\n\"I don't think people here realize that the Gaza Strip is a place where people live,\" she added. \"It's easy to politicize it and write it all off, but it's really where, at one point, eight million people lived. There's no justification for bombing families.\"\n\nRoughly one-fifth of the protestors were homeless people, paid $5 apiece by the Rocky Mountain Peace and Justice Center, which has been open about its history of giving the homeless money in exchange for a bit of sign-waving.\n\n\"I have a certain amount of money which I allocate to hiring them to hold signs,\" said Tom Mayer, one of the organizers. \" They don't have to hold the signs if they don't agree with them, but we feel like it's a way to accomplish both protest against the war and support for the homeless.\"\n\nNicole Sisneros, a homeless Boulder resident, said she would have held a sign for free.\n\n\"I mean, a lot of us do agree with the whole concept that America does need to quit funding these artilleries, so the whole thing can stop,\" she said. \"I just think the whole thing is ridiculous. I don't understand people anymore.\"\n\nOrganizers of Saturday's protest said they'll be back at the same corner at 11 a.m. Aug. 2.\n\nContact Camera Staff Writer Alex Burness at burnessa@dailycamera.com or twitter.com/alex_burness.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/news/boulder/ci_26222255/gaza-violence-reverberates-boulder-voices-raised-protest", "sailthru.author": "By Alex Burness ,  Camera Staff Writer", "ag": {"canon": "BoulderDailyCamera:article:26222255:view"}, "startDate": "2014-07-26T14:43:06-0600", "twitter": {"domain": "dailycamera.com", "description": "About 30 people, waving \"Free Gaza\" and \"Cut $$$ to Israel\" signs, gathered at the corner of Broadway and Canyon Boulevard  in downtown Boulder on Saturday  for a peaceful protest against Israeli attacks on civilian Palestinians.", "title": "Gaza violence reverberates in Boulder as voices raised in protest", "url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/news/boulder/ci_26222255/gaza-violence-reverberates-boulder-voices-raised-protest", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site21/2014/0726/20140726__27DCAPROw~1.jpg", "site": "@dailycamera", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "modificationDate": "2014-07-27T09:24:47-0600", "endDate": "2024-07-26T14:35:23-0600", "news_keywords": "Boulder News, Boulder News news, Boulder Colorado Boulder News news, Boulder Colorado news, Boulder News Boulder news, Boulder News Colorado news, US Boulder News news, world Boulder News news.", "byline": "By Alex Burness,", "pubDate": "2014-07-26T14:47:12-0600", "sailthru.date": "2014-07-26T14:43:06-0600", "sailthru.title": "Gaza violence reverberates in Boulder as voices raised in protest", "verify-v1": "TakAiHiDAOiNOP+m0YTx4DQeyjor+bTdc8e+pw6bDoI=", "sailthru.section": "Boulder News", "description": "About 30 people, waving \"Free Gaza\" and \"Cut $$$ to Israel\" signs, gathered at the corner of Broadway and Canyon Boulevard  in downtown Boulder on Saturday  for a peaceful protest against Israeli attacks on civilian Palestinians.", "sailthru.site": "dailycamera.com", "msvalidate.01": "9DAB14005AD5A9FFA4CA0EF58CC794BA", "og": {"url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/news/boulder/ci_26222255/gaza-violence-reverberates-boulder-voices-raised-protest", "image": "http://extras.dailycamera.com/images/dailycamera3.png", "type": "article", "description": "About 30 people, waving \"Free Gaza\" and \"Cut $$$ to Israel\" signs, gathered at the corner of Broadway and Canyon Boulevard  in downtown Boulder on Saturday  for a peaceful protest against Israeli attacks on civilian Palestinians.", "title": "Gaza violence reverberates in Boulder as voices raised in protest"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "867892b0357001538903740c75a206f0"}, "google-site-verification": "07CC1xPDVU0znu496XTAjLyC32Ylj8zwWHlmrzx3pgY", "y_key": "c9d9b53f7f5af674"}, "article_summary": "The hour-long demonstration, organized by the Rocky Mountain Peace and Justice Center, drew a constant stream of supportive honks from drivers.\n\"I don't think people here realize that the Gaza Strip is a place where people live,\" she added.\nJames Duncan holds signs protesting with the Rocky Mountain Peace and Justice Center on the corner of Canyon Boulevard and Broadway against Israel's military action in Gaza.\n(David R.
