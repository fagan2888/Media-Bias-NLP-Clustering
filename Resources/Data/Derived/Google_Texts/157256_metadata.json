They can even put the snowflakes on the trees. But they can\u2019t do anything else\u2014if they decorate said trees with bows, garland, or lights, for instance, they will be in violation of Cornell\u2019s Guidelines for Inclusive Seasonal Displays.\n\nThe guidelines, according to the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education, were actually issued by the university\u2019s Department of Environmental Health and Safety\u2014meaning that the university implicitly endorses the notion that emotional safety is just as important as physical safety. In other words, politically-incorrect holiday displays aren\u2019t just offensive\u2014they are considered a fire hazard.\n\nOf course, we\u2019re stretching the definition of \u201cpolitically-incorrect\u201d pretty thin here if Santa Claus counts. Check out the full list of forbidden decorations:\n\nGUIDELINES FOR INCLUSIVE SEASONAL DISPLAYS Winter Holiday Displays/Decorations that are Consistent with Cornell\u2019s Commitment to Diversity and the University Assembly Guidelines: Snowflakes\n\nTrees (in accordance with Fire Safety Guidelines) decorated with snowflakes and other non-religious symbols Winter Holiday Displays/Decorations that are Consistent with University Assembly Guidelines But Should be Basis of Dialogue Within Unit or Living Area Trees decorated with bows, garland and lights (in accordance with Fire Safety Guidelines)\n\nWreaths with bows (in accordance with Fire Safety Guidelines)\n\nCombination of snowflakes, (in accordance with Fire Safety Guidelines), Santa Claus figure, and dreidel\n\nHolly Winter Holiday Displays/Decorations that are NOT Consistent with Either University Assembly Guidelines or the University\u2019s Commitment to Diversity and Inclusiveness Nativity scene\n\nMenorah\n\nAngels\n\nMistletoe\n\nStars at the top of trees\n\nCrosses\n\nStar of David\n\nAs FIRE\u2019s Catherine Sevcenko wrote: \u201cYou can put up anything you want as long as it\u2019s a snowflake.\u201d\n\nCornell is a private university, and isn\u2019t obligated to extend free speech rights to students and faculty. If administrators really want to purge religious iconography from campus, arguably, they can.\n\nBut I fail to see the point of doing so. Surely the goal of \u201cinclusivity\u201d is not well-served by telling students of a certain religious group that they can\u2019t celebrate Christmas according to their own customs. Cornell administrators should really do the opposite of what they\u2019re doing: they should encourage members of campus to participate in the holidays as much or as little as they want. The more displays, the better. This might even give students the opportunity to interact with tradition and belief systems that are different from their own, which is the ultimate goal of a college education.\n\nRelated: GWU Ordered a Student to Remove the Palestinian Flag from His Dorm Window", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "Delicate snowflakes", "title": "Cornell\u2019s Insane Christmas Decoration Rules: No Santa Claus, Holly, or Trees with Bows", "url": "http://reason.com/blog/2015/12/23/cornells-insane-christmas-decoration-rul", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/145089034784.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Delicate snowflakes", "title": "Cornell\u2019s Insane Christmas Decoration Rules: No Santa Claus, Holly, or Trees with Bows", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/145089034784.jpg", "creator": "@robbysoave", "site": "@reason", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 17548474116}, "article": {"tag": "Religion", "published_time": "2015-12-23T17:12:00+00:00", "author": "http://reason.com/people/robby-soave"}, "msvalidate.01": "212A68A07785B3080038A845C4EE8905", "google-site-verification": "-AmMiilAN-pnjWt369CUWae-VQ-b9wmH4fSGyhbkQxw", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2"}, "article_summary": "At Cornell University, students and staff can celebrate the holidays by putting up snowflake decorations and trees.\nBut they can\u2019t do anything else\u2014if they decorate said trees with bows, garland, or lights, for instance, they will be in violation of Cornell\u2019s Guidelines for Inclusive Seasonal Displays.\nThey can even put the snowflakes on the trees.\nOf course, we\u2019re stretching the definition of \u201cpolitically-incorrect\u201d pretty thin here if Santa Claus counts.\nSurely the goal of \u201cinclusivity\u201d is not well-served by telling students of a certain religious group that they can\u2019t celebrate Christmas according to their own customs."}
