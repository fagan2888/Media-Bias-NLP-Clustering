However, during the second trimester, a grim diagnosis changed everything when a massive, benign brain tumor was found in 39-year-old Melissa Carleton, who had a seizure and has been comatose since March 11. Despite her medical condition, Carleton and husband, 32-year-old Brian Lande, welcomed healthy baby boy West Nathaniel Lande via C-section on Thursday.\n\nPhoto courtesy of Support Melissa Carleton/Facebook.

Although West had a healthy arrival weighing 5 lbs. and 9 oz., the birth has left Lande with mixed feelings. \"As happy as I am to meet my son, it is incredibly painful for Melissa not to be awake with me for this,\" he said.\n\nPhoto courtesy of Support Melissa Carleton/Facebook. Support Melissa Carleton/Facebook\n\nCarleton was first admitted to the hospital 10 weeks ago to undergo surgery for her brain tumor. Originally, the mom-to-be, who is a family therapist, wanted to put off brain surgery until after her son was born, but when Carleton had a seizure in March, she was sent to the operating room. The site of the tumor, KTVU reported, is located in the area of the brain that controls wakefulness, which means she may still be aware of her surroundings.\n\nPhoto courtesy of Support Melissa Carleton/Facebook.

He has been by her side since her coma and has celebrated small victories such as eye movement, eye openings, and even a grin. Carleton\u2019s parents, John and Lawanna Farrell, have praised Lande\u2019s undying support for their daughter and are thrilled West has arrived. \"He has taken care of our daughter in a way that parents can only hope for,\" John told CBS.\n\nAlthough Carleton can open her eyes, she has yet to fully recover from the coma. Her continued care and treatment is expensive, and Lande must eventually return to work as a Santa Cruz County sheriff\u2019s deputy. The couple\u2019s story has been followed on the \u201cSupport Melissa Carleton\u201d Facebook page and on a GoFundMe.com site, which has generated help from family, friends, and strangers. Currently, the GoFundMe page, has raised over $83,000 to help pay for not only hospitals bills, but mortgage payments and Carleton\u2019s practice bills, since they both are not working.\n\nIn the meantime, while Carleton recovers, Lande and her family will make sure the first-time mom gets plenty of time with West. While Carleton cannot change her son\u2019s diaper, doctors have given the OK for her to breastfeed to have plenty of \u201cskin-to-skin\u201d contact, so she can be a mom.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "first-time mom, baby boy, skin-to-skin, brain tumor, benign tumor, coma, comatose, birth, c-section, women's health", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Comatose first-time mom Melissa Carleton delivered a healthy baby boy after being diagnosed with a benign brain tumor during the second trimester and having a seizure.", "title": "Woman In Coma Gives Birth To Healthy Baby Boy, Is Expected To Breastfeed [PHOTOS]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/woman-coma-gives-birth-melissa-carleton-delivers-healthy-baby-boy-expected-breastfeed-skin-skin-time", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/05/23/comatose-mom-gives-birth-healthy-baby-boy.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Comatose first-time mom Melissa Carleton delivered a healthy baby boy after being diagnosed with a benign brain tumor during the second trimester and having a seizure.", "title": "Woman In Coma Gives Birth To Healthy Baby Boy, Is Expected To Breastfeed [PHOTOS]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/woman-coma-gives-birth-melissa-carleton-delivers-healthy-baby-boy-expected-breastfeed-skin-skin-time", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/05/23/comatose-mom-gives-birth-healthy-baby-boy.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/05/23/comatose-mom-gives-birth-healthy-baby-boy.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Conditions", "published_time": "2014-05-23T12:00:35-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-05-23T12:00:33-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Comatose first-time mom Melissa Carleton delivered a healthy baby boy after being diagnosed with a benign brain tumor during the second trimester and having a seizure."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0831\"", "article_summary": "Support Melissa Carleton/FacebookPhoto courtesy of Support Melissa Carleton/Facebook.\nThe couple\u2019s story has been followed on the \u201cSupport Melissa Carleton\u201d Facebook page and on a GoFundMe.com site, which has generated help from family, friends, and strangers.\nSupport Melissa Carleton/FacebookCarleton was first admitted to the hospital 10 weeks ago to undergo surgery for her brain tumor.\nDespite her medical condition, Carleton and husband, 32-year-old Brian Lande, welcomed healthy baby boy West Nathaniel Lande via C-section on Thursday.\nPhoto courtesy of Support Melissa Carleton/Facebook."}
