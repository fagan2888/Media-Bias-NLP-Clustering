Outrageous and unreasonable.\u201d\n\nA seven month long News 13 investigation uncovers a cold-hearted health insurance scandal complete with reckless blunders, secret deals and bizarre billings. If you thought health insurance will always protect you from catastrophic medical costs, think again.\n\nJust ask Brett and Sara Janos.\n\nBrett is an immigration attorney. Sara just graduated from medical school. They became unwitting victims November 6th last year when Sara gave birth to triplets. A joyous event was overshadowed by heartbreak when the Janos triplets were born prematurely in critical condition.\n\nFrom their first breaths, Wyatt, Dustin and Riley struggled to stay alive at Lovelace Women\u2019s Hospital Neonatal Intensive Care Unit. Brett Janos recalls, \u201cI was in another world. (It was) very hard actually seeing them there, pound and a half each and hooked up to a machine.\u201d\n\nWyatt died within just a few days. Three weeks later, his brother Dustin passed away on Thanksgiving. \u201cHe was just critical. We ended up staying the whole Thanksgiving and that evening he kind of gave up,\u201d Brett said.\n\nRiley lived, but stayed in intensive care for an additional four months. Today he is home but Riley will likely face medical challenges the rest of his life. The triplet\u2019s medical bills totaled $3,862,312.\n\nBut this is why we have health insurance.\n\nYou pay your monthly premium, the out of pocket and deductible, and then the insurance company picks up the rest. That\u2019s the way it\u2019s supposed to work, right? Brett and Sara Janos bought their policy from Blue Cross Blue Shield of New Mexico (BCBSNM). The health insurance company explained in some detail all the things its policy would cover. However, there are exceptions Blue Cross Blue Shield does not talk about.\n\nBrett and Sara discovered the reality of health insurance shortly after Dustin died. Just one month after the triplets were born, the couple started receiving incomprehensible invoices from health care organizations they\u2019d never heard of. There were tens of thousands of dollars in billings. \u201cAs far as bills that are stacked on my desk, there\u2019s still probably over $30,000 in bills. I don\u2019t know what one to pay. Every time we are put in collections we\u2019re given an amount that doesn\u2019t match any of the bills,\u201d Brett Janos said in June.\n\nTo understand where all those strange bills were coming from you have to understand Lovelace Hospital\u2019s billing practices. For example, doctors at the Lovelace Neonatal Intensive Care Unit, NICU, treated the Janos triplets. However, even though those physicians work at the NICU, they don\u2019t actually work for Lovelace. It\u2019s part of a secret business deal orchestrated by Lovelace to use contract doctors to staff its NICU. Technically, the physician\u2019s work for a Florida company called Sheridan Healthcare and it was Sheridan that billed Brett and Sara for tens of thousands of dollars in doctor\u2019s fees.\n\nBrett and Sara had never heard of Sheridan Healthcare and no one told them the doctors treating the triplets were not employed by Lovelace Hospital.\n\nWhen Brett asked Blue Cross Blue Shield to explain the more than $20,000 in Sheridan billings, a claims adjuster told him, \u201cYou are responsible for everything.\u201d BCBSNM said even though the Lovelace doctors work in New Mexico, their employer, Sheridan, is out of state. Because the doctor\u2019s paychecks come from Florida, BCBSNM explained, the physician\u2019s services are out-of-network. Out-of-network means Blue Cross Blue Shield of New Mexico won\u2019t pick up the tab. All the Sheridan bills were dumped on Brett and Sara Janos.\n\n\u201cAfter I found out that things were out of network and I was responsible for it, I couldn\u2019t afford it. That\u2019s one reason I stopped paying. If I\u2019m responsible for $30,000, we don\u2019t have that,\u201d Brett told News 13. And when Brett and Sara didn\u2019t pay, Sheridan turned the bills over to a collection agency.\n\nBrett says it never occurred to him that the doctors who were trying to save the lives of his children might be out-of-network. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t cross your mind, especially in an emergency situation. Our kids are rushed in there and they are trying to resuscitate them and trying to get them stable and we\u2019re going to have a talk with the doctor and say who do you work for?\u201d\n\nThe New Mexico Superintendent of Insurance launched an investigation. \u201cThe insured assumes that when they go to a hospital that Blue Cross sponsors that everything that goes on in that hospital is covered by Blue Cross. That was not the case in this case,\u201d Superintendent of Insurance John Franchini said, adding \u201cIt\u2019s wrong. It should not be happening. We should not allow that. We will try to stop it.\u201d\n\nTo file an insurance complaint, go to the NM Office of the Superintendent of Insurance\u2019s website\n\nThe tens of thousands of dollars in bills Blue Cross Blue Shield of New Mexico refused to cover were devastating to the Janos family. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to battle all this and still we know these bills are coming in. No one knows where they are coming from. We later find out we are responsible for them and we get harassing phone calls on top of that, even while we are in the NICU,\u201d Brett Janos says.\n\nAnd, it\u2019s not just bills from Sheridan. When Riley needed delicate eye surgery at Presbyterian Hospital, BCBSNM stuck Brett and Sara with thousands of dollars in doctor\u2019s bills. And when Riley needed hearing aids at UNMH, BCBSNM initially denied the coverage but later changed its mind and covered the bills.\n\nCongresswoman Michelle Lujan Grisham reviewed the Janos case. She told News 13, \u201cPatients have no way of knowing what\u2019s really covered, what isn\u2019t covered, who\u2019s in network, who\u2019s out of network and the fact that this family and many others have to use a spreadsheet to figure out what\u2019s been billed (and) what they pay, is outrageous.\u201d\n\nA spokesperson for Lovelace Health System would not discuss its business relationship with the Florida based Sheridan Healthcare. Neither Lovelace CEO Ron Stern nor Lovelace Chief Financial Officer Stephen Forney would return repeated calls for comment. Sheridan Healthcare also did not respond to questions about its business relationship with Lovelace.\n\nBlue Cross Blue Shield of New Mexico Chief of Staff Janice Torres calls the Janos case, \u201cincredibly complex.\u201d She admits BCBSNM made mistakes and incorrectly processed claims. She said BCBSNM would fix the errors and pay all outstanding claims.\n\nBlue Cross Blue Shield of New Mexico CEO Kurt Shipley did not return our phone calls for comment. We caught up with Shipley recently at a public meeting. We asked him if he felt the Janos family was owed an apology. Shipley responded, \u201cI don\u2019t have a personal apology to say to anybody on camera. Period. I don\u2019t have anything to say on camera because it\u2019s a privacy issue.\u201d\n\nKurt Shipley did tell News 13 he is not aware of any outstanding claims in the Janos case. However, that\u2019s news to Brett and Sara who are still being hounded by Lovelace Health System, Sheridan Healthcare and collection agencies for unpaid medical billings Blue Cross Blue Shield of New Mexico won\u2019t cover.\n\nAccording to New Mexico\u2019s Superintendent of Insurance John Franchini, \u201cIt is a tremendous tragedy and I feel so sorry for this family. I am very upset about the fact there is no transparency, there is no openness or communication like it should have been with this (health insurance) policy.\u201d\n\nCongresswoman Lujan Grisham adds, \u201cWe are not holding the insurance companies accountable for providing coverage. They are supposed to cover these bills. That\u2019s their risk, right? You could get sick, they have to pay. And if they are finding exceptions then something is wrong with the entire system of insurance coverage and that means we in Congress have to do something.\u201d\n\nWhen asked how all this will end, Brett Janos replied, \u201cI don\u2019t know Larry. I do not know.\u201d\n\nBilling Breakdown, What We Learned On June 4th, 2015, the Janos family received an adjusted itemized hospital billing from Blue Cross Blue Shield of New Mexico for the care of Wyatt, Dustin and Riley Janos. This document was provided to the family several months after the New Mexico Superintendent of Insurance began an investigation. Many of the charges that Blue Cross Blue Shield originally listed as \u201cout of network\u201d were later revised as \u201cin network.\u201d The itemized medical billing came in PDF format and is 60 pages long.
