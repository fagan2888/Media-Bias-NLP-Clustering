Wade decision legalized the procedure nationwide in 1973, according to a study from the Guttmacher Institute. Between 2008 and 2011\u2014the latest year for which there is data available\u2014the national annual abortion rate fell 13 percent, down to 16.9 pregnancy terminations per every 1,000 women of reproductive age. Though the study did not focus on possible reasons for the decline, its authors and the press have suggested that improvements in available contraceptive methods could be among the most important factors.\n\nExperts outside Guttmacher put more weight on another factor that the researchers acknowledged: the economy. When times are tough, \u201cWe see people being more regular in their use of birth control, having fewer partners,\u201d and generally taking pains not to get pregnant, said Elizabeth Ananat of Duke\u2019s Sanford School of Public Policy. Though the economy was technically out from under the recession by 2011, unemployment rates for the young and the less educated\u2014the groups most likely to get an abortion\u2014remained dismal.\n\nThough Guttmacher\u2019s latest study shows a precipitous drop, the national abortion rate has in fact been waning since the early 1980\u2019s. \u201cWe\u2019re looking at an ongoing decrease based on increasing access to birth control, with fluctuations based on the economy\u2014basically, with how much people want to avoid getting pregnant,\u201d Ananat said.\n\nThe Guttmacher study hypothesizes that women\u2019s growing awareness of long-term birth control options like intra-uterine devices (IUDs), which are less fallible than condoms and the pill, is making the difference. But in general, experts are divided over how big a part birth control has played. In a 2012 experiment at Washington University, the abortion rate in St. Louis plummeted more than 20 percent in two years after the school started handing out free birth control to area women. But few other studies have definitively linked contraceptives to a drop in decisions to terminate unwanted pregnancies.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "//assets.newrepublic.com/assets/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "It's not due to harsh new laws in many states\u2014not yet, anyway", "og": {"site_name": "New Republic", "description": "It's not due to harsh new laws in many states\u2014not yet, anyway.", "title": "The Real Reason Abortion Has Declined", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://images.newrepublic.com/a7d757fd13871562b0feb9dd0ad5600add42d9a9.jpeg?w=1109&h=577&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg", "url": "https://newrepublic.com/article/116458/us-abortion-statistics-show-decline-will-new-laws-change", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "https://images.newrepublic.com/a7d757fd13871562b0feb9dd0ad5600add42d9a9.jpeg?w=1024&h=512&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg", "title": "The Real Reason Abortion Has Declined", "description": "It's not due to harsh new laws in many states\u2014not yet, anyway.", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@newrepublic"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#ffffff", "parsely-metadata": "{\"thumb_image\":\"http://images.newrepublic.com/a7d757fd13871562b0feb9dd0ad5600add42d9a9.jpeg\"}", "parsely-page": "{\"title\":\"The Real Reason Abortion Has Declined\",\"link\":\"https://newrepublic.com/article/116458/us-abortion-statistics-show-decline-will-new-laws-change\",\"section\":\"statistics\",\"pub_date\":\"2014-02-03T22:38:59.000Z\",\"post_id\":116458,\"author\":\"Nora Caplan-Bricker\",\"type\":\"post\",\"tags\":[\"statistics\",\"The Plank\",\"Politics\",\"Culture\",\"guttmacher institute\",\"Recession\",\"Affordable Care Act\",\"contraception\",\"Economy\",\"-type_article\"]}", "fb": {"admins": 4404589, "pages": 161419311535, "app_id": 1675346479369918}, "msapplication-TileImage": "//assets.newrepublic.com/assets/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/thenewrepublic", "tag": "statistics", "published_time": "2014-02-03"}, "theme-color": "#ffffff"}, "article_summary": "Though Guttmacher\u2019s latest study shows a precipitous drop, the national abortion rate has in fact been waning since the early 1980\u2019s.\nBut in general, experts are divided over how big a part birth control has played.\nBetween 2008 and 2011\u2014the latest year for which there is data available\u2014the national annual abortion rate fell 13 percent, down to 16.9 pregnancy terminations per every 1,000 women of reproductive age.\nIn a 2012 experiment at Washington University, the abortion rate in St. Louis plummeted more than 20 percent in two years after the school started handing out free birth control to area women.\nThe Guttmacher study hypothesizes that women\u2019s growing awareness of long-term birth control options like intra-uterine devices (IUDs), which are less fallible than condoms and the pill, is making the difference."}
