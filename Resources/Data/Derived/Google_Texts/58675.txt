A high-rise hotel that has been in the works for years will come up for review by a city of Charleston panel next week.

The project by locally based Jupiter Holdings is at 600 Meeting St., between Huger Street and an on-ramp to the Ravenel Bridge. It would be nine stories tall, or 100 feet.

Plans show 23,000 square feet of office space on the top three floors. The ninth floor will include a terrace for dining.

Floors two, three, four, five and six will have parking.

It was reported last year that Jupiter was going with a dual-brand concept featuring Element by Westin and Aloft, both from the Starwood Hotels stable.

The plans are scheduled to go before the Board of Architectural Review at a June 3 special meeting. Schmitt Walker Architects designed the building.

Bristol-bound

Charlestowne Hotels will have a hand in a hotel opening up near the Virginia-Tennessee border.

The Mount Pleasant-based lodging company has been tapped to manage a 67-room boutique property opening in Bristol, Va., in a vacant downtown office structure known as Executive Plaza. Upstate developer Marcus McCall’s Hotel Bristol will include meeting space, a spa, a rooftop cocktail lounge and retail stores when it opens in fall 2016, according to a statement.

In a report in the Bristol Herald Courier, Charlestowne Hotels executive Larry Spelts said it “will be the first upscale hotel to be developed in downtown since the ’30s and the first upscale hotel that’s been in operation in downtown Bristol in over 40 years.”

Charlestowne Hotels oversees a number of properties both within and outside the region, including Georgia, Wyoming, Florida and Arizona.
