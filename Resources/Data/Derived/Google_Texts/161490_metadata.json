( Steve Stoner / Loveland Reporter-Herald )\n\nFORT COLLINS \u2014 Aside from a sprained ankle suffered by Daniel Bejarano in the first half, Colorado State accomplished exactly it wanted to in Saturday's 88-60 win over Division II Arkansas-Fort Smith.\n\nIn extending its best start in program history to 10-0, which is also one win shy of the team's longest win streak ever, the Rams were able to get their handful of role players plenty of minutes and production.\n\nGian Clavell led all players with 17 points, all in the second half, while CSU also had three other players in double figures, with Joe De Ciman matching a career-best with 15 points, and Carlton Hurst adding 13 and J.J. Avila 10.\n\nJohn Gillon and Marcus Holt also each scored nine points, helping the Rams to a season-most 48 bench points.\n\n\"I liked the way we beat them, particularly with mostly our backups,\" CSU coach Larry Eustachy said. \"It was a good game for the guys who have paid the price in practice and haven't had a chance to play much.\"\n\nHolt saw significant minutes for the first time all season, and he was active from the start, scoring eight points and grabbing three rebounds in the first half. Holt and Hurst \u2014 both Denver natives \u2014 were a combined 10 of 11 from the floor.\n\n\"I thought Marcus showed me something that makes you think,\" Eustachy said. \"He's got length. It only adds depth to our team. That's the best he's played since I've coached him.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"It only adds intrigue to our team and adds to what I think is a team that's not nearly as good as I think they're going to get.\"\n\nComing off a huge win at Colorado on Wednesday, the Rams led the entire afternoon, but there were a few stretches that weren't pretty, particularly early.\n\nBut after the Lions got within seven on a free throw by DaVaunta Thomas with 4 minutes to play in the first half, CSU ended the frame on a 15-0 run to take a 40-18 lead at the break. CSU extended the run to 20-0 to start the second half to erase any doubt by going up 27.\n\nColorado State's Carlton Hurst, center, goes up for a shot between Arkansas-Fort Smith defenders Kenny Martin, left, and Blake Branham in the first half Saturday at Moby Arena (Steve Stoner / Loveland Reporter-Herald)\n\nDe Ciman, who has scored 15 now on four different occasions, continued his solid 3-point shooting, where he entered the day leading the team at 44.4 percent. The junior guard from Saskatchewan, Canada, was 3 of 5 from behind the arc, part of an efficient scoring day in which he was 6 of 8 from the floor.\n\n\"I'll give that to the unselfishness of the team,\" De Ciman said. \"I'm getting wide-open looks, because people are penetrating and guys have to help, so it's to the unselfishness of this team.\"\n\nAs far as Bejarano goes, a team spokesperson said the sprained ankle the senior guard suffered midway through the first half wasn't serious. Bejarano, who leads the team in assists and is second in points and rebounds, landed awkwardly after taking a long jumper early in the first half. He remained down for an extended period of time, limped off the floor and did not return.\n\nThe good news for Bejarano and his teammates is that the Rams will finally get a couple welcomed days off following busy stretch the past few weeks. They'll take Sunday off, practice Monday, and then have Tuesday off as well with final exams coming up.\n\n\"We're just going to enjoy this time off,\" Clavell said. \"Just get our rest, hydrate and just enjoy it. You don't get too many of those (days).\"\n\nAfter Tuesday's day off, though, it's right back at it to prepare for Friday's game at Denver, just the second road game of the team all season.\n\n\"We've got a huge game coming on Friday,\" Eustachy said. \"That's the type of game we need -- a good team on the road.\"\n\nSean Star: 970-669-5050 ext. 512, sstar@reporter-herald.com or Twitter.com/SeanVStar", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.reporterherald.com/sports/ci_27132214/colorado-state-basketball-keeps-rolling-improves-10-0", "modificationDate": "2014-12-13T21:06:00-0700", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site47/2014/1213/20141213__14rhsCMBw~1_300.jpg", "sailthru.author": "By Sean Star \n \n  Reporter-Herald Sports Writer", "description": "FORT COLLINS \u2014 Aside from a sprained ankle suffered by Daniel Bejarano in the first half, Colorado State accomplished exactly what it wanted to in Saturday's 88-60 win over Division II Arkansas-Fort Smith.", "ag": {"canon": "LovelandReporter-Herald:article:27132214:view"}, "startDate": "2014-12-13T17:50:19-0700", "og": {"url": "http://www.reporterherald.com/sports/ci_27132214/colorado-state-basketball-keeps-rolling-improves-10-0", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site47/2014/1213/20141213__14rhsCMBw~1.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "FORT COLLINS \u2014 Aside from a sprained ankle suffered by Daniel Bejarano in the first half, Colorado State accomplished exactly what it wanted to in Saturday's 88-60 win over Division II Arkansas-Fort Smith.", "title": "Colorado State basketball keeps on rolling, improves to 10-0"}, "twitter": {"domain": "reporterherald.com", "description": "FORT COLLINS \u2014 Aside from a sprained ankle suffered by Daniel Bejarano in the first half, Colorado State accomplished exactly what it wanted to in Saturday's 88-60 win over Division II Arkansas-Fort Smith.", "title": "Colorado State basketball keeps on rolling, improves to 10-0", "url": "http://www.reporterherald.com/sports/ci_27132214/colorado-state-basketball-keeps-rolling-improves-10-0", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site47/2014/1213/20141213__14rhsCMBw~1.jpg", "site": "@reporterherald", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-12-13T17:50:19-0700", "sailthru.site": "reporterherald.com", "endDate": "2024-12-13T17:41:01-0700", "sailthru.title": "Colorado State basketball keeps on rolling, improves to 10-0", "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "sailthru.section": "Sports", "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "google-site-verification": "XzsHDcJw4iXBQEYtDXFRaUAdKzxhSvxWMgXyQQNFFzg", "byline": "By Sean StarReporter-Herald", "sailthru.image.full": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site47/2014/1213/20141213__14rhsCMBw~1.jpg", "pubDate": "2014-12-13T17:54:18-0700", "news_keywords": "Sports, Sports news, Loveland Colorado Sports news, Loveland Colorado news, Sports Loveland news, Sports Colorado news, US Sports news, world Sports news."}, "_id": "\"57477afa6914bd0286fe5642\"", "article_summary": "\"It was a good game for the guys who have paid the price in practice and haven't had a chance to play much.\"\nCSU extended the run to 20-0 to start the second half to erase any doubt by going up 27.\n\"That's the type of game we need -- a good team on the road.\"\nJohn Gillon and Marcus Holt also each scored nine points, helping the Rams to a season-most 48 bench points.\n\"I liked the way we beat them, particularly with mostly our backups,\" CSU coach Larry Eustachy said."}
