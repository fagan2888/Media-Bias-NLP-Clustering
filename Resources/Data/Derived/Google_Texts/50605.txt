The original series field got a little more crowded today as both Yahoo and Microsoft released plans to create original streamable shows.

With the ability to stream TV shows and movies, the small screen has moved out of the living room and become mobile. Netflix took it one step further by adding “House of Cards,” its Emmy-winning, original series, and several others including a reboot of “Arrested Development” and original drama “Orange Is the New Black.” Amazon and Hulu also have original series such as “Alpha House” and “The Awesomes,” and are introducing more.

The battle to lure binge-watchers continues with news that Yahoo is introducing four new shows, and Microsoft has tapped the likes of Seth Green, Michael Cera and Sarah Silverman to create six shows to be streamed via Xbox.

According to the Verge, Microsoft’s plans include a TV series based on the video game “Halo,” directed by Steven Spielberg; a reality TV series about street soccer called “Every Street United”; a sci-fi drama called “Humans”; and several others. Some of the shows, like “Every Street United,” will have games and interactive features associated with the show that you unlock as you watch.
