As LynNell Hancock reported in this 2011 Smithsonian piece:\n\nEducators had little idea it was so successful until 2000, when the first results from the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA), a standardized test given to 15-year-olds in more than 40 global venues, revealed Finnish youth to be the best young readers in the world. Three years later, they led in math. By 2006, Finland was first out of 57 countries (and a few cities) in science. In the 2009 PISA?scores released last year, the nation came in second in science, third in reading and sixth in math among nearly half a million students worldwide.\n\nNow it looks like the Finns are on to another interesting idea, this time in the criminal justice arena: assessing fines for certain offenses based upon ability to pay.\n\nAs explained in this Atlantic piece by Joe Pinsker:\n\nFinland\u2019s system for calculating fines is relatively simple: It starts with an estimate of the amount of spending money a Finn has for one day, and then divides that by two\u2014the resulting number is considered a reasonable amount of spending money to deprive the offender of. Then, based on the severity of the crime, the system has rules for how many days the offender must go without that money. Going about 15 mph over the speed limit gets you a multiplier of 12 days, and going 25 mph over carries a 22-day multiplier.\n\nSuch a system is certainly worthy of consideration in this country, where the illogic of heaping hefty fines and penalties upon those least able to pay, and then jailing those who don\u2019t pay, has been well-documented.\n\nHere\u2019s Durham County Chief District Court Judge Marcia Morey:\n\nWe say, \u201cokay, you got $250 to do community service, you got $180 to pay for your court costs, you may have a fine, you have attorney\u2019s fees of $55 an hour and a $6 dollar court appointment fee\u201d \u2013 add that all up on someone who\u2019s unemployed, mentally ill, charged with a misdemeanor. \u201cAnd if you don\u2019t pay, you\u2019re going to jail.\u201d What kind of system is that? I mean, of course it\u2019s a revolving door.\n\nPinsker points out that the Finnish system is not without its critics, but argues that at the very least introducing it conceptually could turn the conversation here:\n\nDay-fines could introduce some fairness to a legal system that many have convincingly shown to be biased against the poor. Last week, the Department of Justice released a comprehensive report on how fines have been doled out in Ferguson, Missouri. \u201cFerguson\u2019s law enforcement practices are shaped by the City\u2019s focus on revenue rather than by public safety needs,\u201d it concluded. \u201cThere\u2019s a renewed interest in this because of the outrageous kind of fining and gouging that has become well-known out of Ferguson,\u201d says Judith Greene, who founded Justice Strategies, a nonprofit research organization. \u201cBut of course that kind of stuff goes on everywhere.\u201d Greene says that day-fines won\u2019t curb the troubling practice of aggressive, means-to-an-end fining, but it would be effective to introduce them anyway. \u201cThen the criminal fines should come into the picture as they were originally intended, which is a criminal sanction\u2014a penalty for crime\u2014and then scaled appropriately,\u201d she says.", "article_metadata": {"fb": {"pages": 71966175060}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://pulse.ncpolicywatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/cropped-logo_shadow-square-270x270.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1c5e\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThen the criminal fines should come into the picture as they were originally intended, which is a criminal sanction\u2014a penalty for crime\u2014and then scaled appropriately,\u201d she says.\nNow it looks like the Finns are on to another interesting idea, this time in the criminal justice arena: assessing fines for certain offenses based upon ability to pay.\nLast week, the Department of Justice released a comprehensive report on how fines have been doled out in Ferguson, Missouri.\n\u201cAnd if you don\u2019t pay, you\u2019re going to jail.\u201d What kind of system is that?\nThen, based on the severity of the crime, the system has rules for how many days the offender must go without that money."}
