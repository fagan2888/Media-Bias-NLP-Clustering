European Pressphoto Agency\n\nOn a blindingly sunny day last August, James Pallotta, the Roma ASR 1.07 % owner, watched his team go through its preseason routine on a college campus in suburban Boston. He reflected how, after focusing on attacking players, his team was trying to be more balanced, an approach that would hopefully yield better results.\n\nAlmost two months into the Italian season, the numbers suggest he's been thoroughly vindicated.\n\nRoma, a club that many bookmakers rated as only the seventh best in Serie A when the season began, is off to its best start ever, having won all seven of its games. Nobody wants to get too excited, but of the seven teams that have won their first seven matches to start a Serie A season, just one, Inter in 1966-1967, failed to win the title.\n\nWhat's more, Roma has scored 20 goals this season, at a clip of almost three a game. In the top five European leagues, only Barcelona\u2014which, along with Atletico Madrid is also enjoying a perfect season so far\u2014has done better, with an average of 3.5 per game.\n\nBut we knew Roma could score: last year, despite a sixth-place finish, it notched 71 goals. That was just two off the league's high scorer, Napoli.\n\nThe remarkable bit of the turnaround has been defensively. Roma has conceded just once, proving to be more watertight than anyone else among Europe's elite leagues. Contrast this with last season, when only three of the 20 teams in Italy's Serie A allowed more goals.\n\nNow, it's true that before Saturday night's 3-0 away win at Inter, Roma's schedule had been somewhat soft, apart from the derby against crosstown rival Lazio.\n\nBut it's equally true that when you compare fixtures year on year, the improvement has been staggering. Against the five opponents they've faced this season (the other two were newly promoted clubs) Roma has accumulated 15 points. Last year, in the corresponding fixtures, it managed just four.\n\nSo what's behind the turnaround?\n\nCertainly not massive spending in the summer. Roma sold players for a total of $140 million\u2014among them, pricey stars such as defender Marquinhos and forwards Erik Lamela and Dani Osvaldo \u2014while shelling out close to $90 million on newcomers. The positive net spend is impressive, given the results. It suggests that rather than buying big, Roma bought smart.\n\nDutch midfielder Kevin Strootman, a $22.5 million pickup from PSV Eindhoven is a case in point.\n\nBig, strong and tireless, the 23-year-old Strootman is the kind of guy who will only appreciate in value. He was pursued by a number of top clubs, but Roma got the deal done early, probably saving itself a few million in the process.\n\nIt was a similar story with the French-born Moroccan central defender Mehdi Benatia.\n\nA former youth standout who lost his way a bit, Benatia had resurfaced at provincial club Udinese where, over the past three seasons, he had quietly established himself as one of the better central defenders in Europe. Roma snapped him up almost as soon as the transfer window opened for a very reasonable $18 million.\n\nThe real value-added seems to have come from Roma's new boss, the Frenchman Rudi Garcia.\n\nHis appointment itself was criticized among the \"what-have-you-done-for-me-lately\" brigade. In 2010-2011 he guided Lille to the French League and Cup double, while playing some sparkling football. But after that victory Lille slipped to third and then sixth and he was no longer flavor of the month.\n\nIn fact, Lille's decline probably had more to do with the fact that his squad was gutted as his star players ( Eden Hazard, Mathieu Debuchy, Yohan Cabaye, Moussa Sow and Gervinho) were sold and replaced with lesser players.\n\nGarcia continued to raise eyebrows in preseason. First, he urged Roma to sign Gervinho. The Ivorian forward had excelled for him at Lille, but had been a bust at Arsenal in the previous two years. With a hefty contract, the 26-year-old wasn't exactly cheap either at $10 million. And yet, reunited with his old mentor, Garcia, he's been devastating this season.\n\nBut it was Garcia's approach to preseason training that was a real shock.\n\nItalian clubs, more than most, are known for their summer boot camps, where players are pushed to physical limits in an attempt to build up the stamina required to last the season. Indeed, Garcia's predecessor, Zdenek Zeman, used to revel in making his players run up and down the stadium steps, Bear Bryant-style.\n\nGarcia, who has a background in fitness, opted instead for a less-is-more approach. His preseason camp only lasted nine days and his weekly training schedule is extraordinarily light by Serie A standards\u2014conditioning is only done on Wednesdays.\n\nAnd yet it seems to be working. It's not just Roma's results. It's also the fact that 70% of the club's goals this season have come in the second half, suggesting the team stays strong while the opposition flags.\n\nThe new manager has also done a sterling job at keeping a lid on controversy and getting homegrown veteran stalwarts like Daniele De Rossi and Francesco Totti \u2014who between them have 37 seasons' and 1,105 games' worth of service to the club\u2014to buy into his methods. And that's something which, over the years, has been crucial to anyone wishing to manage this club.\n\nThe recipe for success obviously goes well beyond this. Roma had arguably the second best squad in Serie A last season and underachieved. This year, perhaps the side is overachieving.\n\nBut few would have expected it to reach this level so quickly or Garcia to have such an impact.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "article.created": "2013-10-06T19:07:00.000Z", "article.section": "Sports", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "Article", "twitter": {"domain": "wsj.com", "description": "New manager's approach has sparked a turnaround for Serie A leaders.", "title": "Roma Responds to Shock Tactics", "image": {"src": "https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/OB-ZE354_marcot_G_20131006104743.jpg", "alt": "Garcia's Tactics Spark Turnaround at Roma", "identifier": "https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/OB-ZE354_marcot_D_20131006104743.jpg"}, "site": "@WSJ", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "al": {"ios": {"url": "wsj://launch?articleid=SB10001424052702304171804579119081478740084&headline=Garcia%26apos%3Bs%20Tactics%20Spark%20Turnaround%20at%20Roma&weburl=http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304171804579119081478740084"}}, "page.site.product": "WSJ", "keywords": "A.S.%20Roma%20S.p.A.,ASR.MI,Rudi Garcia,soccer,sports,recreation,content types,factiva filters,fc&e exclusion filter,routine general news,spectator sports,sports teams,clubs,performing arts,sports promotion,leisure,arts", "news_keywords": "A.S.%20Roma%20S.p.A.,ASR.MI,Rudi Garcia,soccer,sports,recreation,content types,factiva filters,fc&e exclusion filter,routine general news", "article.headline": "Garcia's Tactics Spark Turnaround at Roma", "cXenseParse": {"candybar": {"image": "https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/OB-ZE354_marcot_E_20131006104743.jpg"}, "poptart": {"image": "https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/OB-ZE354_marcot_D_20131006104743.jpg"}}, "description": "New manager's approach has sparked a turnaround for Serie A leaders.", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=364387007,app-argument=wsj://launch?articleid=SB10001424052702304171804579119081478740084&headline=Garcia%26apos%3Bs%20Tactics%20Spark%20Turnaround%20at%20Roma&weburl=http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304171804579119081478740084", "user.type": "nonsubscriber", "article.page": "Sports", "page.content.format": "responsive", "article.summary": "New manager's approach has sparked a turnaround for Serie A leaders.", "page.site": "wsj", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2013-10-06T19:07:00.000Z", "dj.asn": "i-e96c", "robots": "noarchive,noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj", "image_count": 1, "word_count": 925}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Article", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "New manager's approach has sparked a turnaround for Serie A leaders.", "title": "Roma Responds to Shock Tactics", "url": "http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304171804579119081478740084", "image": {"width": 553, "identifier": "https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/OB-ZE354_marcot_G_20131006104743.jpg", "height": 369}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "author": "Gabriele Marcotti", "article.access": "free", "page.content.source": "WSJ Online Article", "article.origheadline": "Roma Responds to Shock Tactics", "article.type": "Soccer", "article.id": "SB10001424052702304171804579119081478740084", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2013-10-06T19:07:00.000Z"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fccd05\"", "article_summary": "Against the five opponents they've faced this season (the other two were newly promoted clubs) Roma has accumulated 15 points.\nWhat's more, Roma has scored 20 goals this season, at a clip of almost three a game.\nRoma had arguably the second best squad in Serie A last season and underachieved.\nBut we knew Roma could score: last year, despite a sixth-place finish, it notched 71 goals.\nHe reflected how, after focusing on attacking players, his team was trying to be more balanced, an approach that would hopefully yield better results."}
