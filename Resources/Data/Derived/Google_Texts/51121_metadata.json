After having some initial success, he tried to expand his operation into the nation\u2019s capital, where he discovered just how difficult getting a tour guide license can be. The city required all tour guides to be U.S. citizens and to have resided in Washington, D.C., for at least three years.\n\nMain had a green card but was not yet a citizen. And he didn\u2019t live in the city.\n\nBecause of that, he wasn\u2019t allowed to tell people about the history of the Washington Monument, or explain the significance of the Lincoln Memorial.\n\n\u201cI did not see why my right to talk for a living should be contingent on my citizenship or residence,\u201d Main told the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee last week.\n\nThe government couldn\u2019t prove what interest that served, either. In 2014, the U.S. Court of Appeals struck down most of Washington\u2019s tour guide licensing law, after a lawsuit filed by Main challenged the regulations on First Amendment grounds.\n\nMain is still fighting. He\u2019s currently involved in a challenge against a similar licensing scheme at Gettysburg National Park in Pennsylvania.\n\nAt a time when bipartisanship is sorely lacking in Washington, senators from both parties agree with the White House on the issue of occupational licensing: It\u2019s out of control.\n\nEven though occupational licensing is mostly a state and local issue, the federal government is increasingly interested in the topic. A U.S. Supreme Court case decided in 2014 opened the possibility that onerous licensing schemes could be challenged under antitrust laws because they unfairly protect existing businesses from competition.\n\nThe Federal Trade Commission and the White House have recently weighed in, supporting the Supreme Court\u2019s perspective.\n\nNow Congress is getting on board.\n\n\u201cThe rapid growth of state licensing boards that are controlled by members of the profession they regulate has become a major threat to equal opportunity in this country,\u201d said Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, in a statement about last week\u2019s hearing. \u201cWe need to examine the causes and consequences of such a major obstacle to economic mobility.\u201d\n\nSen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., said professions given the power to regulate themselves must do so in a way that protects consumers and does not harm competition.\n\nThere\u2019s plenty of evidence that many licensing schemes do the latter.\n\nIt takes 890 days to become licensed as a barber in Nevada.\n\nIn Iowa, it takes 2,100 hours of training to become a licensed hair-braider. That\u2019s 17 times the amount of training required to become an EMT.\n\nWant to become an interior designer in Florida? You\u2019ll need six years of training to be licensed.\n\nIn all, more than 25 percent of all jobs in America now require a government-issued permission slip.\n\nDefenders of licensing schemes argue they are needed to protect public health and safety, but academic research increasingly questions that view.\n\n\u201cThe reality is that occupational licensing is likely to reduce employment growth, contributes to unemployment, and increases costs to consumers,\u201d said Morris Kleiner, a professor of economics at the University of Minnesota.\n\nKleiner\u2019s research shows that residents of Minnesota pay $3 billion per year in higher costs because of licensing requirements. Those costs turn into increased revenue for license-holders, at the expense of consumers and would-be entrepreneurs.\n\nThere\u2019s scant evidence that licensing protects public health and safety, Kleiner told the committee.\n\nThere\u2019s also a generational gap created by the licensing schemes, because older, established businesses and individuals who hold licenses have an incentive to shut the door on competition from new businesses.\n\n\u201cYoung people shouldn\u2019t need an expensive permission slip from the government to seek work in their desired fields,\u201d said David Barnes, policy director for Generation Opportunity, a national nonprofit advocating policies that increase economic freedom for millennials. \u201cRepealing occupational licenses will allow young people to chase after their dreams and strengthen our economy.\u201d\n\nMain eventually won the right to give tours in Washington, but he\u2019s still scratching his head about some of the weird rules in the city\u2019s licensing policy\u2014like the one that said the licensing requirement did not apply if you stood in a single spot and spoke but did apply if you moved around to different locations.\n\n\u201cI was never able to see what government interest could possibly be served by such a scheme,\u201d he said.\n\nOriginally published at Watchdog.org.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Congress is getting on board to get rid of onerous licensing requirements for tour guides and others trying to start a business.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Congress is getting on board to get rid of onerous licensing requirements for tour guides and others trying to start a business.", "title": "Want to Give a Tour of Washington, DC?
