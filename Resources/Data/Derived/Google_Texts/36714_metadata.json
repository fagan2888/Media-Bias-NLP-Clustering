Davis.\n\nBack in 2012 the college of the Ozarks filed a lawsuit that attempted to gain the university an exemption from the affordable care acts mandated coverage of birth control. That suit was then put on a type of legal pause called an abeyance.\n\nBut today the university\u2019s president filed a brief, or a legal statement of support, in a series of cases currently facing the supreme court that are also looking to gain exemption due to their religious beliefs. If the Supreme Court sides with the religious institutions seeking exemption the College of the Ozarks says they will likely get an exemption as well.\n\n\u201cIf the Supreme Court rules that the mandate is a substantial burden on religious organizations, the game is over,\u201d Lewis says.\n\nKevin Pybas is a constitutional law professor at Missouri State University. We asked him how much of an impact the College of the Ozarks\u2019s brief would have on the legal battle the other religious institutions are fighting against the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cWell it will certainly have an impact. But it\u2019s not their case. They have their own separate case but it is going to be affected by whatever the Supreme Court does in this case, on which, [The College of the Ozarks] is weighing their views,\u201d says Pybas.\n\nPresident Davis\u2019s brief states that the penalties facing employers that refuse to cooperate with the Affordable Care Act\u2019s mandates could cost the college up to 100 dollars a day for each employee, totaling a 10,000,000 dollar annual fee for not following the Obamacare mandate. Lewis says these penalties are \u201cdraconian\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe live in America. We don\u2019t live in North Korea or somewhere. I think we are being treated like we are slaves of the state. And we are being told that we can\u2019t honor our own religious convictions,\u201d said Lewis.", "article_metadata": {"description": "SPRINGFIELD, Mo-- \"They are forcing us to be a part of a process that makes us complicit with the provision of abortaficient drugs which we find morally wrong,\" says College of the Ozarks President Jerry C.
