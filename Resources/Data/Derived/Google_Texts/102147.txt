The fun continued Saturday as festival goers enjoyed locally grown produce, a hog cook-off, and a 4-H Club kids festival.

The Kinston-Lenoir County 4-H Club represented the agricultural and sustainable energy lifestyle at the festival. Children were able to get a glimpse into what it's like growing your own food, collecting it from animals, and selling it.

There are a variety of ways to cook a hog, and during the hog cook-off, the chefs showed off their various methods of preparing one. Some used the grill, a smoker, and some used the ground. They then chopped up the meat, sauced it, and served it with all of the necessary fixings. One of the competitors told us it's all about having a good time. "I always cook with my dad, but this year I branched off. We even let me use his grill and he used someone else's. I had a really good time," Brittany Brayboy said.

Locally grown produce is a staple of Lenoir County, so it is no surprise that farmers sell their freshest fruits and vegetables at the festival. Aside from fruits and vegetables, eggs and other products filled up tables.

Local celebrity chef, Vivian Howard, says she proudly buys locally grown produce. We talked to the person she buys some of her food from, Warren Brothers. "It's just something that grabbed a hold of me back in the 70's when I first heard about it. I practiced in the home garden...and decided, especially when Vivian opened the restaurant here in Kinston, and she wanted vegetables, so it just seemed a good fit so I started raising vegetables, flowers, and herbs for her," Brothers said.

WITN is a proud sponsor of the 34th annual BBQ Festival on the Neuse presented by the Kinston-Lenoir County Chamber of Commerce.
