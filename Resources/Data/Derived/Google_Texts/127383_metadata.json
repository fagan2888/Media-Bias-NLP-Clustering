No, seriously. In another time and place, he might have been respected as an effective technocrat \u2014 a smart guy valued (although probably not loved) for his ability to get things done. In fact, that\u2019s kind of how it worked when he was governor of Massachusetts, a decade ago.\n\nBut now it\u2019s 2015 in America, and Mr. Romney\u2019s party doesn\u2019t want people who get things done. On the contrary, it actively hates government programs that improve American lives, especially if they help Those People. And this means that Mr. Romney can\u2019t celebrate his signature achievement in public life, the Massachusetts health reform that served as a template for Obamacare.\n\nThis has to hurt. Indeed, a few days ago Mr. Romney couldn\u2019t help himself: he boasted to the Boston Globe that \u201cWithout Romneycare, we wouldn\u2019t have had Obamacare\u201d and that as a result \u201ca lot of people wouldn\u2019t have health insurance.\u201d And it\u2019s true!\n\nBut such truths aren\u2019t welcome in the G.O.P. Ben Carson, who is leading the latest polls of Iowa Republicans, has declared that Obamacare is the worst thing to happen to America since slavery; 81 percent of likely Republican caucus-goers say that this statement makes him more attractive as a candidate.\n\nNot surprisingly, then, Mr. Romney quickly tried to walk his comments back, claiming that Obamacare is very different from Romneycare, which it isn\u2019t, and that it has failed.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut you know, it hasn\u2019t. On the contrary, the Affordable Care Act has been a remarkable success, especially considering the scorched-earth opposition it has faced.\n\nFirst of all, a lot of people \u2014 around 16 million, the administration estimates, a picture confirmed by independent sources \u2014 do indeed have health insurance who otherwise wouldn\u2019t. Millions more would be insured if Republican-controlled states weren\u2019t refusing to expand Medicaid (even though the federal government would pay the costs) and generally trying to obstruct the program.\n\nHow good is the insurance thus obtained? Not perfect: despite subsidies, policies are still hard for some to afford, and deductibles and co-pays can be onerous. But most people enrolled under Obamacare report high satisfaction with their coverage, which is hugely better than simply not being uninsured. And may I inject a personal note? If truth be told, I live in a pretty rarefied, upper-middle-class-and-above milieu \u2014 yet even so I know several people for whom the Affordable Care Act has been more or less literally a lifesaver. This is, as Joe Biden didn\u2019t quite say, a really big deal.\n\nOh, and have you noticed how those ads featuring people supposedly hurt by Obamacare have disappeared? That\u2019s because none of their stories held up.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the big Biden deal has come in below budget. Insurance premiums in Obamacare\u2019s first two years were well below predictions. It looks as if there will be a partial rebound in 2016, but it\u2019s still cheaper than expected. And over all, health care spending has slowed dramatically.\n\nMeanwhile, none of the bad things that were supposed to happen have. Employment growth since the \u201cjob-killing\u201d law went into effect has been faster than at any time since the 1990s. Employers have not, in fact, eliminated full-time jobs to avoid the act\u2019s provisions. And the budget deficit keeps falling.\n\nIn short, President Obama, Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid, who pushed the Affordable Care Act through despite total opposition from the G.O.P., have a lot to be proud of. And so does Mr. Romney, who helped lay the foundation. Instead, however, he\u2019s trashing the best thing he\u2019s ever done.\n\nYou have to wonder: Does Mr. Romney really think that his party would look more favorably on Obamacare if it worked even better than it has, if it cost no money at all? If so, he\u2019s delusional. After all, the great majority of Republican-controlled states have turned down free money, refusing to let the federal government expand Medicaid (and in so doing pump money into their economies).\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe point is that from the point of view of the Republican base, covering the uninsured, or helping the unlucky in general, isn\u2019t a feature, it\u2019s a bug. It\u2019s not about how much it costs in taxpayer funds or economic impact: the base is actually willing to lose money in order to perpetuate suffering.\n\nAnd a movement with those values has no use for technocrats. Ask Ben Bernanke, who has given up on a party in thrall to the \u201cknow-nothingism of the far right.\u201d\n\nMaybe Mr. Romney still imagines that a desperate party will call on him to save it from Donald Trump. Or maybe he just can\u2019t bring himself to admit that he picked the wrong group of people to hang out with. Either way, one hopes for his sake that he eventually gives up his illusions.
