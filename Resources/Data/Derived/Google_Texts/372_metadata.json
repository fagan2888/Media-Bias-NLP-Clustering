Many conservative critics of Boehner have expressed disgust with his leadership in the House of Representatives because he has offered little resistance to President Obama\u2019s leftist agenda. As Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz told the Family Research Council\u2019s Values Voter Summit recently, \u201cThere\u2019s a frustration across this country.... Every election Republicans promise to fight for American principles, and then the day after the election we come to Washington and we don\u2019t fight for any of the principles we said we\u2019d fight for.\u201d\n\nWith the exit of John Boehner, conservatives hoped the next speaker would be better. So, the question is, would Ryan differ?\n\nEarly indications of a significant change with Ryan are not encouraging to constitutionalists.\n\nWhite House Deputy Press Secretary Eric Schultz told the press corps that the president has found Ryan in the past a man he could work with. \u201cThe president believes that Congressman Ryan is someone who has given considerable thought to the significant issues that must be worked through in Congress.\n\nSchultz specifically mentioned two issues where Ryan has worked with Obama: trade deals and immigration.\n\nIndeed, Ryan has been a leader in Congress in supporting Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) for the Obama administration, and has favored immigration reform with a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants and the expedited legalization for children of illegal immigrants who attend college.\n\n\u201cWe hope that whoever is the next speaker assumes that role with a willingness and an interest to work with Democrats,\u201d Schultz added.\n\nRyan is certainly no hard-core conservative. In the \u201cFreedom Index\u201d of the The New American (a congressional scorecard based on the U.S. Constitution), Ryan\u2019s cumulative score is only 58 percent. That is only six points higher than Boehner's score.\n\nBut are Schultz\u2019s praises of Ryan deserved? Concerning trade, Ryan has certainly been very supportive of the various trade agreements \u2014 popularly known as ObamaTrade \u2014 that are considered by a large number of constitutionalist conservatives as threatening to America\u2019s national sovereignty. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) and the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) are so secret that they have not even been made available for members of Congress to view them!\n\nRepresentative Michael Burgess (R-Texas) asked Ryan in June during a meeting of the House Rules Committee about this secrecy. Referring to the fact that only a select group of House members can view the documents (but cannot reveal the contents), Burgess said, \u201cYou read through this language down in the secret room and I welcome the day when people can read it.\u201d Ryan responded that it can be read by the general public \u201conce it\u2019s agreed to.\u201d This caused some to recall former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s reference to the contents of ObamaCare \u2014 \u201cWe have to pass the bill so that you can find out what is in it.\u201d\n\nRyan has been very supportive of the trade negotiation process, including the secrecy. And, it is feared that the trade agreements will touch on immigration, as well. This is the other area in which Obama\u2019s press secretary praised Ryan\u2019s help of the president.\n\nAmong the most ardent foes of illegal immigration is Senator Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.). Sessions worries that the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) would make major changes in America\u2019s immigration policy \u2014 without congressional action. \u201cThere are numerous ways TPA [Trade Promotion Authority] could facilitate immigration increase above current law \u2014 and precious few ways anyone in Congress could stop its happening,\u201d Sessions said last spring.\n\nSessions warned that language \u201calready present in both TPA and TPP provide the basis for admitting more foreign workers, and for longer periods of time, and language could be added to TPP or any future trade deal to further increase such admissions.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cThe president has circumvented Congress on immigration with serial regularity,\u201d and these trade deals would weaken the ability of Congress to do anything about it.\n\nCurtis Ellis, executive director of American Jobs Alliance, was blunt in his assessment of the effect of TPP: \u201cIt is a Trojan horse for Obama\u2019s immigration agenda.\u201d\n\nObama has denied this, and Paul Ryan has supported this denial. Ryan told Newsmax that the inclusion of provisions on immigration in the TPP deal is \u201cabsolutely not true,\u201d dismissing it as \u201cthe latest urban legend.\u201d\n\nWikiLeaks has published documents from the secret Trade in Services Agreement (TiSA), leading Rosemary Jenks, the director of government relations for Numbers USA, to challenge the assertion of both Obama and Ryan, saying that the existence of 10 pages on immigration in the TiSA \u201cmake it absolutely clear in my mind that the administration is negotiating immigration \u2014 and for them to say they are not \u2014 they have a lot of explaining to do based on the actual text.\u201d\n\nIt would appear that there is at least some basis for Schultz\u2019s expectation that Paul Ryan would \u201cwork\u201d with Obama in the future, based on past performance. It is noteworthy that Congressman Tom Cole (R-Okla.), a staunch ally of Boehner, has come out strongly for Ryan.\n\nThose who hope for improvement under a Ryan speakership will most likely be disappointed. Michael Needham, CEO of the conservative Heritage Action for America, speaking recently on Fox News Sunday, summed up the problem. \u201cWe need a Republican leadership that is showing conservative values. That\u2019s not what we\u2019ve had.\u201d\n\nWe certainly will not get it with a speaker who works with Obama on trade agreements that diminish American national sovereignty and with the White House on a more liberal immigration policy.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Paul Ryan, Obama, Speaker, House, trade, immigration", "og": {"url": "http://www.thenewamerican.com/usnews/congress/item/21815-obama-thinks-he-can-work-with-ryan", "image": "http://www.thenewamerican.com/media/k2/items/cache/f309b5c904f2f4e0df6e18fff49403b1_XL.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Those looking for a big change in Congress by replacing John Boehner with Paul Ryan are likely to be disappointed.
