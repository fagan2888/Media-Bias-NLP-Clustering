Seeing the crisis in Ferguson unfold highlighted just how militarized some of our local police departments have become with grenade launchers, armored vehicles, sniper rifles and more at their fingertips. Truth be told \u2013 it\u2019s scary.\n\nEven more disturbing is the thought that any one of us is in danger of a similar tragedy after a questionable encounter with law enforcement. So the question remains: what can be done right now to prevent another Michael Brown?\n\nThere is a relatively affordable and simple solution: body cameras. These little wonders of technology are already in use in many cities across the United States. For years police departments both big and small have used body cameras with astounding results. A one-year study conducted by criminal experts found an 88 percent decline in complaints about officer misconduct and a 59 percent decline in police brutality. The American Civil Liberties Union has done extensive research and found that body cameras benefit both citizens and police by eliminating he-said-she-said situations \u2013 not to mention by potentially saving taxpayers and cities money in costly lawsuits.\n\nWhile it\u2019s not a complete solution, it\u2019s the right start in making sure someone is policing the police. That\u2019s why we\u2019re asking you to sign this White House petition requiring body cameras (like Go-Pros\u2122) to be worn by all police as part of their uniform. The goal is to get 100,000 signatures by September 11, 2014.\n\nThere\u2019s no time like the present. Oh, and don\u2019t forget to share this petition on Facebook and Twitter.\n\nXO,\n\nTeam Ronan\n\n\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "description": "Whether you believe police should be armed to the teeth \u2013 or not \u2013 the question remains: what can be done right now to prevent another Michael Brown?", "original-source": "http://www.msnbc.com/ronan-farrow-daily/the-call-policing-the-police", "og": {"site_name": "MSNBC", "description": "Whether you believe police should be armed to the teeth \u2013 or not \u2013 the question remains: what can be done right now to prevent another Michael Brown?", "title": "THE CALL: POLICING THE POLICE", "url": "http://www.msnbc.com/ronan-farrow-daily/the-call-policing-the-police", "image": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/aptopix_police_shooting_missouri.jpeg-0e5fb.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "msnbc.com", "account_id": 2836421, "title": "THE CALL: POLICING THE POLICE", "url": "http://www.msnbc.com/ronan-farrow-daily/the-call-policing-the-police", "image": {"width": 830, "identifier": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--3-2--512x342/public/body_cam.jpg?itok=XWG1Lsmr", "height": 553}, "creator": {"identifier": "@msnbc", "id": 2836421}, "site": {"identifier": "@msnbc", "id": 2836421}, "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Whether you believe police should be armed to the teeth \u2013 or not \u2013 the question remains: what can be done right now to prevent another Michael Brown?"}, "robots": "follow, index", "DC.date.issued": "2014-08-18T17:27:10-04:00", "jenga-session-config": "{\"when_to_init\":\"after_dom_ready\"}", "fb": {"app_id": 351594351545594}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/msnbc", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/msnbc"}, "abstract": "Whether you believe police should be armed to the teeth \u2013 or not \u2013 the question remains: what can be done right now to prevent another Michael Brown?", "nv": {"author": "yasmin-aslam", "title": "THE CALL: POLICING THE POLICE", "address": "http://www.msnbc.com/ronan-farrow-daily/the-call-policing-the-police", "published": 1, "date": "08/18/2014 17:27:10 EDT", "tags": "criminal-justice,society,ronan-farrow-daily"}, "news_keywords": "Society, Criminal Justice"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd80cc\"", "article_summary": "While it\u2019s not a complete solution, it\u2019s the right start in making sure someone is policing the police.\nThere is a relatively affordable and simple solution: body cameras.\nFor years police departments both big and small have used body cameras with astounding results.\nThat\u2019s why we\u2019re asking you to sign this White House petition requiring body cameras (like Go-Pros\u2122) to be worn by all police as part of their uniform.\nSo the question remains: what can be done right now to prevent another Michael Brown?"}
