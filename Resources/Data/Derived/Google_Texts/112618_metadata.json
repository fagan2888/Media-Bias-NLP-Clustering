Jeb Bush speaks during an interview with The Associated Press in Coralville, Iowa. (Photo: Jae C. Hong/AP)\n\nIt\u2019s broken promises that have earned both Jeb Bush and Lindsay Graham a lack of respect from Republican voters.\n\nThroughout social media, conservative anger toward Bush and Graham equals that of Roman Senator Cato the Elder who ended speeches with, \u201c \u2026 and Carthage must be destroyed.\u201d\n\nToday, conservatives begin and end their diatribes with \u201cBush and Graham must go,\u201d or epithets to that extent.\n\nDonald Trump is the nominee, and for those of us who supported other candidates (this writer supported Scott Walker, \u201ca workhorse, not a show pony\u201d and then Ted \u201cI didn\u2019t come to Wash-ington to make friends, I came to fight for limited government\u201d Cruz), know this: Any cabinet built by \u201cthe bloviating hyperbolist\u201d will do less damage to our country than \u201cCrooked Hillary,\u201d the scheming political profiteer.\n\nThis is one of the most important elections in recent history if for no other reason than we have three aging Supreme Court justices who will likely be replaced within the next presidential term.\n\nSure, there\u2019s no guarantee Trump will nominate Constitution-respecting conservatives to the Supreme Court. But it\u2019s certain Hillary won\u2019t.\n\nIt\u2019s the reason Jeb and Graham need to put on their big boy pants and help Trump win.\n\nAnthony Kennedy is 79 years old, four months younger than the late Antonin Scalia.\n\nRuth Bader Ginsburg is 83.\n\nStephen Breyer is 77.\n\nRick Jensen (Photo: Cagle Cartoons)\n\nAntonin Scalia\u2019s philosophy was to judge whether cases brought to the Supreme Court truly merited a review by the Supreme Court, or if those cases constitutionally belonged to the states or congress.\n\nLiberal justices lean toward judging cases based upon their own perceptions of current social values.\n\nBoth Jeb and Graham pledged to support the eventual Republican nominee, figuring Trump would never be the candidate they\u2019d be forced to back.\n\nThey were wrong, so now they break their promise, like Jeb\u2019s dad when he promised, \u201cno new taxes.\u201d\n\nIn 2014, Americans sent Republicans to Congress to fight President Obama\u2019s overreach and defund Obamacare, which is failing millions. They also promised to defund Obama\u2019s executive amnesty and attach spending cuts to every increase in the debt ceiling.\n\nThey lied.\n\nLast September at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library, Lindsey Graham confessed, \u201cI\u2019m tired of telling people things they want to hear that I know we can\u2019t do.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s success was built on the promises and lies of both parties, especially Republicans in the Class of 2014.\n\nI have written about the dangers of Trump being truly liberal, and have not changed that opinion. He will be an \u201cinside-the-beltway\u201d president with a cabinet of insiders and insider advisers.\n\nI\u2019ll be surprised if any of his cabinet has no experience in a political realm.\n\nHillary, whose campaign is focused on the dangers of Trump, is more dangerous.\n\nWe have seen her sell out America as Secretary of State, especially in giving U.S. uranium production to Russia in exchange for Russia and other related foreign entities funneling millions into the Clinton Foundation.\n\nHer Victory Fund fundraisers have \u201cgiven\u201d $61 million to state Democratic parties, only to require those state parties to give so much of that money to both DNC and her own campaign that it leaves only 1 percent with the states, according to estimates done by Politico\n\nIt\u2019s a level of dishonesty that Democrats seem to be able to live with.\n\nObama has broken a litany of promises, such as closing Guantanamo, which he likely knew would never happen. He knew millions of Americans would lose their insurance policies, doctors and children\u2019s specialists under Obamacare, but pushed it through anyway. How about his promises to create an \u201cunprecedented level of openness\u201d in his government and to promote \u201cstimulus\u201d as an agenda to repair infrastructure?\n\nIn fact, Obama has so many failed promises that popular website lists range from \u201cTop Ten\u201d to \u201cTop 25,\u201d Top 50,\u201d and even a couple of sites that promote \u201c1,202 well sourced examples of Obama\u2019s lying, lawbreaking, corruption, cronyism, hypocrisy, waste, etc.\u201d\n\nMaybe liberal Democrats are more readily forgive their candidates\u2019 broken promises, thievery and lies.\n\nConservative Republicans don\u2019t seem to forgive broken promises so easily.\n\n\u00a9 2016 Rick Jensen\n\nRead or Share this story: http://www.baxterbulletin.com/story/opinion/2016/05/23/broken-promises-flood-election-season/84346638/", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Broken Promises Flood Election Season", "og": {"site_name": "The Baxter Bulletin", "description": "Broken Promises Flood Election Season", "title": "Broken Promises Flood Election Season", "url": "http://www.baxterbulletin.com/story/opinion/2016/05/23/broken-promises-flood-election-season/84346638/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/baxterbulletin.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Broken Promises Flood Election Season", "title": "Broken Promises Flood Election Season", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/2d6af92a457fe56a49e578a5eeaeb5ff4246e376/c=556-0-2780-2224&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2016/05/13/MountainHome/B9322160342Z.1_20160513170239_000_GQQEC79JN.1-0.jpg", "creator": "@BBNewsroom", "site": "@BBNewsroom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=875264530", "fb": {"app_id": 183082181717378}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fddce6\"", "article_summary": "(Photo: Jae C.
