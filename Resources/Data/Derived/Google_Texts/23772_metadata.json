Even with politics narrowly defined as lobbying, campaign contributions and other payments to expressly political groups, AFT spends more on politics than teachers may expect.\n\nBased on Political Activities and Lobbying spending plus payments to political organizations listed elsewhere in the union\u2019s annual report, AFT poured more than $27 million in member dues into political activism during the 2014 fiscal year ending June 30.\n\nAdditionally, compensation for AFT bosses who travel the country demanding bigger government is frequently treated as general overhead. Only 2 percent of the $557,875 AFT paid President Randi Weingarten was reported as Political Activities and Lobbying in 2014.\n\n\u201cThis is business as usual,\u201d Association of American Educators communications director Alexandra Freeze told Watchdog.org in a phone interview. \u201cTeachers unions are some of the biggest contributors to partisan politics in the country, and that\u2019s coming out of teacher dues, it\u2019s coming out of tax funds.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe members we welcome are certainly sick of being political pawns in that game and are not interested in funding partisan causes or candidacies, and they\u2019re not interested in being told how to vote,\u201d Freeze added. AAE, a national nonunion professional association for teachers, was founded in 1994 and has members in all 50 states.\n\nAFT reported $2,352,550 in payments to political groups as Contributions, Gifts and Grants and $312,187 as Representational Activities in the 2014 fiscal year. The union also gave more than $3 million to union organizing campaigns in Connecticut, Louisiana, Illinois and elsewhere.\n\n\u201cThe average teacher, they\u2019re busy in the classroom and some of this information is hidden very well,\u201d Freeze said. \u201cTeachers need to know that information, they need to know where their dues are going.\u201d\n\nAFT didn\u2019t respond to a Watchdog.org inquiry about how the union makes spending decisions and discloses its spending to members.\n\nThe teachers union indirectly supported presumptive Democrat presidential candidate Hillary Clinton with payments of $250,000 to Clinton Foundation and $200,000 to Clinton Global Initiative reported as Contributions, Gifts and Grants. AFT also donated $300,000 to late \u201cliberal lion\u201d Ted Kennedy\u2019s Edward M. Kennedy Institute for the United States Senate.\n\nEconomic Policy Institute, a union think tank, received $275,000 from AFT, while more than a dozen political nonprofits received four- and five-figure contributions. Smaller AFT Contributions, Gifts and Grants made during the union\u2019s 2014 fiscal year included:\n\nAFT reported payments of $75,000 to left-wing think tank Public Policy and Education Fund of New York and $73,854 to community organizing group Recommit Wisconsin Project as representational expenses. Other AFT expenditures reported as Representational Activities included:\n\n$50,000 to community organizing group Common Good Ohio\n\n$40,000 to Campaign for America\u2019s Future, \u201cthe strategy center for the progressive movement\u201d\n\n$30,000 to The Atlas Project, a group created \u201cto help build the institutional memory of the progressive movement\u201d\n\n\u201cTeachers believe that they are spending money on professional development and liability insurance; they don\u2019t realize that a lot of this money is going to staff overhead and partisan politics,\u201d Freeze told Watchdog.org.\n\n\u201cRegardless of a teacher\u2019s politics, I think they\u2019d rather see that money in their own pocket than into teachers union dues that aren\u2019t going to benefits for them or going to the classroom, they\u2019re going to these super-partisan campaigns or candidacies or foundations that might not reflect their values.\u201d\n\nExcluding state and local affiliate dues, AFT headquarters charged $213.36 for the privilege of membership. AFT can take mandatory \u201cfair share\u201d fees almost as costly as member dues from public school teachers in 21 states and the District of Columbia who decline to join the union.", "article_metadata": {"description": "American Federation of Teachers spent over $27 million in member dues on \"progressive\" politics in the union's 2014 fiscal year.", "og": {"site_name": "Watchdog.org", "description": "American Federation of Teachers spent over $27 million in member dues on \"progressive\" politics in the union's 2014 fiscal year.", "title": "Teachers squeezed for $27 million in union political spending - Watchdog.org", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2014/10/weingarten-aft-twitter-2014-10-16.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-10-24T15:31:39+00:00", "url": "http://watchdog.org/178693/teachers-union-politics/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Watchdog.org", "description": "American Federation of Teachers spent over $27 million in member dues on \"progressive\" politics in the union's 2014 fiscal year.", "title": "Teachers squeezed for $27 million in union political spending - Watchdog.org", "image": {"src": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2014/10/weingarten-aft-twitter-2014-10-16.jpg"}, "creator": "@jasonahart", "site": "@watchdogorg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noarchive", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Watchdogorg", "section": "Labor", "published_time": "2014-10-27T04:00:42+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-10-24T15:31:39+00:00"}, "news_keywords": "union, teachers union, AFT, American Federation of Teachers, Randi Weingarten, union politics, union political spending, Big Labor, teachers union politics"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcae83\"", "article_summary": "Considering that most of AFT\u2019s members are public-sector workers, essentially all AFT activities are political.\nBased on Political Activities and Lobbying spending plus payments to political organizations listed elsewhere in the union\u2019s annual report, AFT poured more than $27 million in member dues into political activism during the 2014 fiscal year ending June 30.\nOnly 2 percent of the $557,875 AFT paid President Randi Weingarten was reported as Political Activities and Lobbying in 2014.\nBy Jason Hart | Watchdog.orgAmerican Federation of Teachers reported $24.9 million in political and lobbying expenditures during its most recent fiscal year, but even that figure understates the union\u2019s actual spending on politics.\nEven with politics narrowly defined as lobbying, campaign contributions and other payments to expressly political groups, AFT spends more on politics than teachers may expect."}
