Disarmament campaigns, run both by weak Somali governments and by the U.S. military in the early 1990s, have had limited success. But the government is trying again.\n\nTroops raided a military official\u2019s home and discovered guns that authorities said were going to be sold to al-Shabab rebels. The official was arrested after a heavy firefight, said Mohamed Yusuf, the spokesman for Somalia\u2019s national security ministry. Security forces also raided a garage belonging to the former anti-U.S. warlord Osman Atto, who died last year, seizing rocket-propelled grenades and bombs, Yusuf said.\n\nRaids over the last week have netted some 500 guns and hundreds of boxes of ammunition, he said.\n\nTwo more night raids followed against a former U.S.-backed anti-Islamist warlord, Abdi Nurre Siad, who escaped during a firefight at his home. Troops also raided a home belonging to a Somali member of parliament who is the son of a former warlord. No weapons were found, Yusuf said.\n\n\u201cSo far we have made good progress in the disarmament plan,\u201d said Yusuf. \u201cThis plan is to ensure the stability of Mogadishu.\u201d\n\nOne intelligence official was killed during the operations, according to Yusuf.", "article_metadata": {"description": "500 guns seized: Somalia tries to disarm Mogadishu", "title": "500 guns seized: Somalia tries to disarm Mogadishu", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "500 guns seized: Somalia tries to disarm Mogadishu", "title": "500 guns seized: Somalia tries to disarm Mogadishu", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/08/14/500_guns_seized_somalia_tries_to_disarm_mogadishu/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/08/somalia-disarmament-campaign.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "500 guns seized: Somalia tries to disarm Mogadishu", "title": "500 guns seized: Somalia tries to disarm Mogadishu", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/08/somalia-disarmament-campaign.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Abdi Guled", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "\u201cSo far we have made good progress in the disarmament plan,\u201d said Yusuf.\nRaids over the last week have netted some 500 guns and hundreds of boxes of ammunition, he said.\nTroops raided a military official\u2019s home and discovered guns that authorities said were going to be sold to al-Shabab rebels.\nDisarmament campaigns, run both by weak Somali governments and by the U.S. military in the early 1990s, have had limited success.\nThe official was arrested after a heavy firefight, said Mohamed Yusuf, the spokesman for Somalia\u2019s national security ministry."}
