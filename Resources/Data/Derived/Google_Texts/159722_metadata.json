Cheezburger, Inc.\n\nForget the best of 2013. We want to know what went terribly wrong.\n\nLuckily the good people at FAIL blog rounded up the most spectacular flame-outs, fiascos and screw-ups of the year, known on the Internet as FAILs.\n\nWho embodied this spirit of complete and total failure most in 2013?\n\nNo, it wasn't Toronto's crack-smoking mayor, Rob Ford, who was voted the third biggest FAIL by the Cheezburger community. Instead, the title goes to Justin Bieber, who, despite posting the most popular photo on Instagram, gained 28 percent of the overall FAIL vote.\n\nPeople were also tired of Kim Kardashian and Kanye West, the celebrity couple known as \"Kimye,\" who raised eyebrows with the bizarre video for \"Bound 2\" off Kanye's \"Yeezus\" \u2014 which was nearly overshadowed by a shot-by-shot parody from James Franco and Seth Rogen.\n\nJames Franco and Seth Rogen doing their best \"Kimye\" impression. YouTube\n\nOverall, the top five human FAILs were:\n\n\n\nJustin Bieber (28 percent)\n\nMiley Cyrus (19 percent)\n\nRob Ford (16 percent)\n\nKim Kardashian and Kanye West, a.k.a. \"Kimye\" (10 percent)\n\nAnyone who did the Harlem Shake (9 percent)\n\nThere were plenty of events that were deemed FAILs as well, although they were less funny, as they mostly involved government scandal and dysfunction that affected millions of Americans.\n\nFirst and foremost was the government shutdown, which, according to initial estimates by ratings agency S&P, cost the economy $1.5 billion a day.\n\n\n\nYes, Washington grinding to a halt for 16 days was a big deal, but what about that weird photo of Beyonce that was going around the Internet?\n\nNot Beyonce's best look. Cheezburger, Inc.\n\nWorry not; that ranked third on the list, right above the disastrous launch of Healthcare.gov, the online hub for the healthcare exchanges set up by the Affordable care Act.\n\n\n\nThe top five events that failed the Cheezburger community:\n\nThe U.S. Government shutdown (32 percent)\n\nN.S.A. surveillance (22 percent)\n\nBeyonce's unflattering photo (19 percent)\n\nHealthcare.gov launch (8 percent)\n\nManti Te'o's fake girlfriend (5 percent)\n\nHopefully Manti Te'o, currently playing in the NFL for the San Diego Chargers, can come up with an even more egregious fake lady friend to comfort him after being deemed responsible for the fifth biggest FAIL of 2013.\n\nKeith Wagstaff writes about technology for NBC News.
