(AP) - Montana\u2019s high-tech industries are booming, and the growth isn\u2019t showing signs of stopping, a new study reports.\n\nThe study by the University of Montana Bureau of Business and Economic Research showed that wages in those industries are twice the median earning per Montana worker, and they are projected to pump $35 million of investments into the state this year.\n\nThe study commissioned by the Montana High Tech Business Alliance also projects the growth of high tech businesses to be eight to 10 times greater than the average statewide economic growth.\n\nLaunched in April 2014, the alliance strives to provide networking, promotion and job growth for high tech and manufacturing jobs around the state.\n\n\u201cHigh tech and manufacturing represents a very strong economic engine for the state,\u201d Greg Gianforte, MHTBA board chair, told the Independent Record (http://bit.ly/1Ayzqjm ).\n\nThe biggest challenge facing these companies is finding skilled workers to hire, Gianforte said. This is why the alliance launched a high tech jobs portal that could help connect those companies with the skilled workers they seek.\n\nMost of this booming growth is occurring in the greater Bozeman and Missoula markets. Alliance director Christina Henderson said about two-thirds of MHTBA\u2019s members are in those two metropolitan areas.\n\nBut the beauty of many technology careers, Henderson said, is they don\u2019t suffer from geographic limitations.\n\n\u201cThe opportunities to grow businesses in Helena are similar to what\u2019s going on across the state,\u201d she said.\n\nThe alliance has several members in Helena that are striving for growth, such as digital and non-digital gaming developers Anvil Studios, LLC.\n\nBorn and raised in Montana\u2019s capital city, Dylan Kahn partnered with other \u201cyoung talent\u201d to \u201cpursue this new, emerging demographic in the game industry.\u201d\n\nThough working in Helena and other remote communities now, Kahn said the company is contemplating a move to Bozeman or Missoula within the next six to 10 months.\n\nBut eventually it may be forced out of the state.\n\nKahn said Montana \u201chemorrhages\u201d young talent out of the state every year, and if Anvil continues to prosper it may be forced to chase that talent to other areas.\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t been concerned enough with the desires of young people who want to live here, the economy hasn\u2019t reflected those desires or interests,\u201d Kahn said.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Independent Record, http://www.helenair.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "Montana's high-tech industries are booming, and the growth isn't showing signs of stopping, a new study reports.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/feb/22/study-montanas-high-tech-industry-is-thriving/", "site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "type": "article", "description": "Montana\u2019s high-tech industries are booming, and the growth isn\u2019t showing signs of stopping, a new study reports.", "title": "Study: Montana\u2019s high tech industry is thriving"}, "twitter": {"description": "Montana's high-tech industries are booming, and the growth isn't showing signs of stopping, a new study reports.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Study: Montana\u2019s high tech industry is thriving"}, "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca53d\"", "article_summary": "The study commissioned by the Montana High Tech Business Alliance also projects the growth of high tech businesses to be eight to 10 times greater than the average statewide economic growth.\nThis is why the alliance launched a high tech jobs portal that could help connect those companies with the skilled workers they seek.\n\u201cHigh tech and manufacturing represents a very strong economic engine for the state,\u201d Greg Gianforte, MHTBA board chair, told the Independent Record (http://bit.ly/1Ayzqjm ).\nLaunched in April 2014, the alliance strives to provide networking, promotion and job growth for high tech and manufacturing jobs around the state.\n(AP) - Montana\u2019s high-tech industries are booming, and the growth isn\u2019t showing signs of stopping, a new study reports."}
