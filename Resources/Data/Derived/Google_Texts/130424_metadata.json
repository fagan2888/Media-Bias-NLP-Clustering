As we often see in the sports press, most of the parties obligated to opine on the subject have attacked the issue with an almost legalistic focus on specifics, quickly achieved consensus with one another, and then beat the living fuck out of it.\n\nThe agreement regarding Sterling has been to denounce his views as abhorrent and then to absolutely sweep under the rug any of the implications it leaves hanging. There has been far too much high-fiving over this. ESPN out-schlocked even itself covering the Clippers\u2019 subsequent playoff victory over the Warriors, which came the night after civil rights crusader and part-time NBA commissioner Adam Silver banned the owner from even thinking about the NBA ever again. Following this swift decision, which no doubt bent Dr. King\u2019s cosmic arc a bit closer to justice, fans were then morally free to attend the Clippers game and hold up heartfelt signs. No word on whether the ticket money from all these social justiceniks was routed to somewhere besides Donald Sterling\u2019s pocket. (Probably because it wasn\u2019t.)\n\nNothing illustrated the sham victory of deposing Sterling more than the Clippers\u2019 hearty embrace of his estranged wife Rochelle. \u201cI am not a racist,\u201d she said when the tape was first released. \u201cI never have been, I never will be. The team is the most important thing to my family.\u201d Instructive words, these. Just in the same way that \u201cracism\u201d in this story has been portrayed as a binary medical condition, something akin to pregnancy, so does her statement admit that her take on race is relevant only as it pertains to the men who her family employs to play basketball. She was smart to have specified that, lest one conflate her feelings on Clippers blackness with the feelings she is known to have about the unremarkably black and Latino tenants of her residential properties. During her day job as Cruella de Vil, Shelly Sterling has accumulated nearly the same record of outright racism as her piece of shit husband, who, let\u2019s not forget, she has been married to for almost 60 years. She once impersonated the health inspector to obtain a racial census of her buildings. But no, she is not \u201ca\u201d racist. The tests came back negative.\n\nAs these morality plays so often happen, all that matters is that Rochelle Sterling can claim the virtue of having not been recorded on the surreally racist tape that did in the old man. Her reward? A pass from the media and a good word from Clippers coach Doc Rivers, the likeliest person to emerge as the protagonist when they make the Sterling TV movie. \u201cIt\u2019s a tough one for Shelly, really,\u201d Rivers said. \u201cShe didn\u2019t do anything wrong. You have compassion for her.\u201d Indeed, it must have been hell for this wealthy and bitter estranged wife to watch the world pile on her ex-husband and his young mistress.\n\n~\n\nSports media\u2019s conformist coverage of this story is de rigueur when any media, really, is confronted with a news event that reveals one small facet of an enormous and uncomfortable cultural truth. The assassination of Osama bin Laden, for example, could have served as an opportunity for Americans to reexamine the erosions that our system of due process suffered in the U.S.\u2019s pursuit of al Qaeda after 9/11. It could have been a point at which our salient voices asked, The emotional victory of the War on Terror is now won. What cultural mandate is the remainder of this campaign founded on? Instead, we got B-roll of roaring crowds and the president on his victory tour. The event was processed into a humdrum media spectacle, a spiritual victory with a hollow, manufactured center, an American Idol finale. Most news broadcasts showed American crowds uniformly engaged in \u201cjubilation,\u201d which quickly asserted itself as the preferred term for describing the reaction to bin Laden\u2019s death. That\u2019s how you know you\u2019re getting shallow news coverage: when a story\u2019s terminology is uncannily parroted by most outlets, it means that simulacrum, or at least convention, has replaced incision.\n\nThe slogan in the Donald Sterling scandal is \u201dThere is no place for this in our game.\u201d This is one of those weirdly eloquent phrases that loses its honesty in robotic mimesis, like when a tech support worker says \u201cI see\u201d too many times as you describe your problem over the phone. It\u2019s the perfect response to the situation at hand\u2014sympathetic, non-committal, attentive\u2014which makes it that much clearer why it was written into the script. The concept of there being \u201cno room for that in our game\u201d operates likewise. It assumes a high moral vantage and conjures an image of crowding out, of post-racial magnanimity having so overtaken the NBA and the culture at large that small-mindedness just starves for sunlight and dies. The sentiment is more powerful and optimistic than merely condemning Sterling\u2019s statements as ignorant; it\u2019s a dismissal. It\u2019s a verdict. Adam Silver chose the line to punctuate his ruling on Tuesday: \u201cWe stand together in condemning Mr. Sterling\u2019s views. They simply have no place in the NBA.\u201d\n\nIt may be overly final, too. Such a strong stance was doubtless undertaken by the league in order to preclude any further nibbling into the meat of the larger problem. Namely, that Donald Sterling, as an owner in American professional sports, is only one of a tiny overclass of white men who own the exploits of black men.FiveThirtyEight studied the diversity of professional sports ownership: of 49 majority owners in the NBA, only one, Michael Jordan, is black. (That the lone minority among these 48 rich white people had to be the sport\u2019s greatest player to get there recalls Chris Rock\u2019s joke about his neighbor not needing to make it to the \u201cdentist hall of fame.\u201d) Meanwhile, the league is 76% black.\n\nThe \u201cplantation mentality,\u201d as it has been called in a few progressive outlets, is obviously the real narrative. Project how Sterling\u2019s ouster will look 50 or 100 years down the line. It becomes a blip consistent with the larger context of owner-versus-player lockouts, a paltry concussion settlement from the NFL toward ex-players\u2014fought tooth-and-nail, by the way\u2014and the NCAA\u2019s entire larcenous existence. Future generations might wonder what the big deal was in an environment in which David Stern, a Jewish man, managed a league full of black men and kept it in the family by handing over the reins to another Jewish man.\n\nSuch a perspective will easily identify the primacy of the rich white owners in all of this. Everything done by professional leagues, whether enacting player-safety rules to indemnify themselves against injury liability or ostracizing the most provable racist in the whole racist system, is undertaken to protect the owners\u2019 investments.\n\nAfter all, that\u2019s what a sports franchise is: a crown jewel on the balance sheet of some remote industrial baron. And as the cities who have experienced worse know, spouting bigotry on tape is a relatively benign thing for an owner to do. Far more insidious is the practice of actually moving a team away from the fans who not only generate the organization\u2019s revenue, but care about them, win and lose with them, and see themselves in the team. In other words, the people who give the team value in the first place. The biggest scandal in sports is the fact that these mammoth civic touchstones are, in keeping with today\u2019s Second Gilded Age, mere playthings for billionaires. A city thinks it has a real rallying point until a dreaded Irsay or Modell chooses to jingle their plutocratic chains and abduct an entire corpus of shared history to a different goddamn city.\n\nThe whole clubby setup of our major leagues is a threat to the fundamentally great thing about professional sports: their function as civic rallying points. So my problem isn\u2019t with Donald Sterling, though good riddance. Nor is it simply with the enormous, gaping discrepancy in the demographies of professional leagues\u2019 labor and capital. These phenomena are the tip of the iceberg.\n\nI have a problem with the current model of team ownership in general. Luckily, we can replace it.\n\n~\n\nSpend enough time reading and thinking about professional sports, and you will at some point arrive at the realization that it is a diversion as trivial as any reality show. As anyone who has wasted a morning watching two or more SportsCenter cycles can attest, the energy you spend caring about sports is energy deducted from that which can be put toward your real life. Apart from athletes and gamblers, sports have no tangible impact on a fan\u2019s quality of life. They\u2019re here because they\u2019re popular, and because media companies cling desperately to the only attraction left on live TV.\n\nThe benefit of following sports, then, stems totally from the emotional investment that we fans put into it. The wellspring of the vast majority of that emotion is not an innate love of a particular game or a team, but fealty to family and community allegiances. This is why teams affiliate themselves with specific geographies. By doing so, they become symbols attaching their fans to a primal, essential tribalism.\n\nHumans have an innate clan instinct, and sports teams are its latter-day totems. Witness the rise of Europeans\u2019 obsession with national-level soccer competitions at approximately the point in history when they stopped actually warring with each other. Witness the rivalries that sharing a city engenders between two clubs; it\u2019s an update on fighting over the watering hole. This is behavior that comes out one way or another. Organized sports satisfy this primal clannishness in a wholesome, modern way. They suture neighbors into a fanbase and provide nearly inanimate entities\u2014that is, the groups of millionaire athletes whom the fans will never meet\u2014for them to cathect with their shared emotions. A sports team is a reflection of pride of place. That\u2019s what it is good for.\n\nThe single-owner model threatens this relationship. There are numerous frustrations inherent in a cherished team being a mere asset belonging to one individual (erratic hiring decisions and parsimony come to mind) but none more so than an owner\u2019s threat to unilaterally decamp for a different city, thereby destroying an icon of civic pride. It\u2019s happened many times. The most recent example is the Seattle Supersonics\u2019 departure for Oklahoma City, but it is a loss that many cities know well.\n\nOne signal example is Winnipeg, Canada. The Winnipeg Jets played in front of one of the National Hockey League\u2019s most loyal fanbases for fifteen years, despite being the league\u2019s second-smallest market. A confluence of factors in the 1990s began to put financial pressure on the smaller Canadian clubs, and the city began to realize that it didn\u2019t have the leverage to retain the team. An American consortium finally bought the Jets after no local buyer emerged. They moved to Phoenix. The two main reasons argued for Winnipeg\u2019s inability to keep the Jets were that their 15,000-seat arena was too small and that American dollars were too expensive for the small-market team to afford.\n\nThose may have been real problems then, but in 2014 they look transient. The hockey team has done poorly in Phoenix, to no one\u2019s surprise, averaging a league-worst 13,775 attendees per game this season. That\u2019s less than Winnipeg\u2019s supposedly undersized arena would have fit. (That arena has since been replaced.) Moreover, American and Canadian dollars have basically been at parity for the last five years, meaning players today wouldn\u2019t necessarily be demanding the more expensive currency. Clearly, Winnipeg could have sustained their beloved Jets better than owner Jerry Colangelo\u2014who slotted the new Phoenix Coyotes next to the NBA\u2019s Phoenix Suns in his ample portfolio\u2014predicted.\n\nThe best evidence of Winnipeg\u2019s ability to host an NHL team is that they once again have one. The Atlanta Thrashers, victims of yet another genius owner\u2019s attempts to introduce hockey to a southern city, realized that they would fare better in Winnipeg, where people actually care.\n\nThe same process of abandonment and resurrection transpired in Baltimore, Cleveland, Houston, and Charlotte. If these populations are able to support teams now, did it ever make sense for the owners to leave in the first place? Or is this redundant and chaotic team movement a dance of clueless billionaires, loyal fans be damned?\n\nAt the demolition ceremony for Winnipeg Arena, the runty building used to justify the team\u2019s eviction from the city that loved it, hundreds of bereft Jets fans showed up, a decade removed from having a team to root for, and despondently cheered \u201cGo Jets, Go!\u201d to no one. Meanwhile, in that hockey mecca of Phoenix, the team they longed for was at that moment in conservatorship by the league after declaring bankruptcy the previous year. The story ended happily, with Winnipeg getting a Jets team back, but to get there it went through a number of ill-advised, heart-wrenching, and ultimately pointless moves.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Franchises are often just another item on the balance sheet of some remote industrial baron.
