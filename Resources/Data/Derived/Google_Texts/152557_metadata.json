What a metaphor for a nation\u2019s transition from an ethos of earnest effort to a mood of criminal buffoonery. For you who haven\u2019t tuned in to this cultural artifact, Breaking Bad is a cable TV series about a bland high school chemistry teacher, Walter White, who, facing an expensive battle with lung cancer, decides to get into the lucrative business of cooking methamphetamine, the most atrocious recreational drug there is. The series follows his misadventures in the trade.\n\nThe really remarkable thing about the series is that the most interesting theme in the long-running story remains completely undeveloped \u2014 at least so far to within a few installments of the end. That is, Walter\u2019s existential predicament as a hostage to America\u2019s medical racketeering matrix. For many families like Walter White\u2019s, a cancer diagnosis is tantamount to a parallel judgment of financial ruin.\n\nLike everybody else in America these days, poor Walter just submits to his fleecing. In fact, the blandest moments in the long-running melodrama are the scenes when Walter forks over his massive payments to a grandmotherly-type lady at the hospital billing desk. She\u2019s as sweet as pie, though she also seems rather sweetly surprised that he is actually able to pay his bill. He pays for his treatments, of course, with the income derived from his meth cooking venture. His doctors are portrayed as demigods. There is zero discussion by them of A) the cost of his cancer treatments, and B) the legitimacy of the costs. That\u2019s not their department. He just has to come up with hundreds of thousands of dollars.\n\nWhich he does, simply by discarding his persona as an earnest schoolteacher and entering the ranks of illicit drugdom. Of course, the series is mostly concerned with the twists, turns, and torments of that transition, and the metaphors in that are also rich as to what America has lately become. For instance, Walter\u2019s success as a criminal stems from his technological skills. He is the meth cooker supremo because his formula is the best, his lab practices are the most exacting, his standards are the highest! Walter White is the Steve Jobs of meth. He puts out the best product and won\u2019t settle for less than perfection.\n\nThis jibes nicely with America\u2019s current mood of techno-rhapsodic psychosis, in particular our tendency to ignore all the diminishing returns and blowback from our techno-grandiose endeavors \u2014 which range from the magic of shale-oil fracking to the romance of \u201cgreen\u201d skyscrapers, to high-frequency front-running in the stock markets, to the recruitment of every teenager in America into an obsessive-compulsive cell-phone culture. It\u2019s all good. Walter White\u2019s \u201cace-in-the-hole\u201d is his science training.\n\nAnother winning metaphor is the supernatural amount of cash-money on display in almost every episode once Walter gets rolling in the meth trade, duffle-bags full of exquisite, freshly packed-and-stacked banknotes, so much that tossing a quarter-million here, a quarter million there loses its meaning. The stuff is tossed around like junk mail. This is not inadvertent, of course. It depicts nicely the disintegration of America\u2019s value system: money is everything and nothing. Walter quickly joins the \u201cone percent\u201d earnings-wise. It hardly makes him a better person. His money-making operations are as disgusting as the \u201cinnovation\u201d of new swindles among the Too-Big-To-Jail bankers. By mid-way through the series, Walter even has enough petty cash on hand to pay for his brother-in-law\u2019s hospital and rehab bills, after the BOL is shot up by Mexican drug gangsters. The fantastic cost of all that is also ignored.\n\nAn additional metaphor is found in Walter\u2019s \u201cemployer,\u201d the super-polite neatnik Gustavo Fring, who rules the Albuquerque-based drug empire via a false-front fast-food chain of chicken eateries. Fring is the fantasy of every businessman\u2019s ideal self-image: meticulous, careful, fair, \u2014 until Walter White\u2019s buffoonery shoves him over the edge and Gus, too, breaks bad, so to speak, in his own fussy way. And business itself is depicted as the highest-and-best expression of human culture, just as it has been since the reign of Ronald Reagan.\n\nFinally, there is the matter of what the fruits of Walter White\u2019s techno-savy work does to the \u201cconsumer\u201d public who buy his product. It turns them into zombies. It\u2019s also almost too obvious to state that the popularity of zombies in American culture has exactly paralleled the financialization of the American economy. That half the action of Breaking Bad takes place in and around automobiles \u2014 in the parking-lot wasteland of Albuquerque \u2014 is just the cherry on the metaphorical cake. This is who we are.\n\nRelated", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Red, Green, and Blue", "description": "By James Howard Kunstler Kunstler.com The past two months I\u2019ve taken in all but the final few episodes of Breaking Bad, America\u2019s loathe letter to itself.
