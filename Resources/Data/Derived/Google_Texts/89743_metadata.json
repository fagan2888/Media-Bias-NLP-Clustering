The average estimate of 10 analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research was for 92 cents per share.\n\nRevenue rose to $2.72 billion compared to $2.63 billion in the year ago period, the company said.\n\n\u201cOur fourth-quarter results were strong, capping off a very good year for our company,\u201d said Unum Group president and CEO Richard P. McKenney. \u201c2015 was a year where we experienced favorable growth trends in our core business lines and stable benefits experience, which combine to drive strong profitability and capital generation.\u201d\n\nBased in Chattanooga, Tenn., Unum sells insurance in the U.S. and in the United Kingdom. In the U.S., it sells life, accident, disability and supplemental medical policies. Unum also sells life insurance through Colonial Life in Columbia, S.C.\n\nCEO Sees Top-Line Growth, Profits Maintained\n\nIn a conference call with analysts Wednesday, Unum Group executives said the company was raising prices on group insurance products every 18 to 24 months to make up for the low interest rates. While this has meant some decline in business, the softness was well \u201cin line with expectations,\u201d the executives said.\n\nBroad-based education campaigns within companies about the importance and value of insurance, particularly with higher deductibles from the Affordable Care Act hitting consumers, are having an impact on employee and consumer buying habits.\n\nLower oil prices have also meant that employees can spend more on insurance products, Unum executives added.\n\nThe company is ready for a \u201cresumption of top-line growth without sacrificing profitability,\u201d and is well positioned to execute share buy backs in 2016, McKenney said.\n\nFourth-quarter premium income from U.S. group disability policies rose 5.5 percent to $570.6 million compared to the year-ago period as large companies with thousands of employees enroll, Unum said.\n\nPremium income for the U.S. group life and accidental death and dismemberment rose 5.2 percent to $373.6 million compared to the year-ago period, the company reported.\n\nPremium income for supplemental and voluntary benefits increased 5.7 percent to $307.4 million compared to the year-ago period.\n\nEnergy Holdings an Issue\n\nWith several large life insurers reporting after market close Wednesday, analysts will be looking closely at the life insurer energy holdings. In particular, companies\u2019 exposure to below-investment-grade bonds will be scrutinized due to the collapse in the price of oil.\n\nUnum executives said that about $5 billion, or 11.6 percent of the company\u2019s fixed-maturity securities, are tied up in energy holdings.\n\nAsked by one analyst how and when corporate managers decide to write off a bond that no longer pays principal and interest, Unum executives said there are no strict rules governing when to take an impairment.\n\nQuestions corporate investment managers and auditors will ask themselves are, Unum executives said, include: Is there any chance of recouping principal and interest? Do managers decide whether to hold the bond until they recover principal and interest? Is the bond issuer current on payment?\n\nUnum Group stopped selling individual disability policies in 2004, and stopped offering individual long-term care in 2009 and group long-term care in 2012. These policies have been relegated to the closed block.\n\nOther insurance products no longer sold by the company \u2014 group pension, individual life and corporate-owned life insurance, reinsurance pools and management operations, and other miscellaneous product lines \u2014 make up the closed block.\n\nInsuranceNewsNet Senior Writer Cyril Tuohy has covered the financial services industry for more than 15 years.
