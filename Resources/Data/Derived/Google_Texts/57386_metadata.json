Defense and intelligence officials have maintained that the group\u2019s end strength, at least in Iraq and Syria, hovers around 30,000 fighters, even though those same officials claim that the U.S-led military campaign has eliminated thousands of extremists on the ground.\n\nA CIA assessment in late 2014 put the number of ISIS fighters at around 31,500.\n\nThe head-scratching claims and figures could be easier to understand if the information gleaned from the files better defines the breadth and scope of the Islamic State\u2019s global reach and gives a clearer picture of the number of jihadists that have rallied to the group\u2019s infamous black flags.\n\nThe cache also could help in the Obama administration\u2019s efforts to minimize the threat of so-called \u201clone wolves.\u201d\n\nRelated: The Fight Against ISIS Now Includes Chemical Weapons\n\nSeveral White House officials and many senior members of Congress have long warned about radical extremist organizations and their potential to carry out or inspire attacks on the U.S. homeland, similar to the mass shooting that occurred in San Bernardino, California, last year.\n\nThe files could provide a critical starting point in figuring how ISIS goes about trying to recruit, be it through face-to-face contact, online chat rooms, or other means.\n\nAuthorities could use the data to sort out previously unidentified figures in the ISIS command structure or merge the files with existing pieces of intelligence to work their way up to the terror group\u2019s upper echelons.\n\nEither tactic would be a crucial blow to the jihadist group. Just the fact that such information has fallen into the hands of Western officials could prompt the organization to roll up some of its recruitment efforts or allow them to simply wither on the vine.\n\nOf course, the highly-secretive nature surrounding such potential intelligence is a goldmine, and it might be months or years before anyone learns if the files helped lead to reversals in ISIS recruiting efforts.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "If authentic, the disclosure of files containing the personal data of around 22,000 Is", "title": "After a Leak of 22,000 Terrorists\u2019 Names, Heads Will Roll at ISIS", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/03/10/After-Leak-22000-Terrorists-Names-Heads-Will-Roll-ISIS", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/mideast-crisis-iraq-anbar_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/03/10/After-Leak-22000-Terrorists-Names-Heads-Will-Roll-ISIS", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/mideast-crisis-iraq-anbar_1.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "If authentic, the disclosure of files containing the personal data of around 22,000 Is", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "A CIA assessment in late 2014 put the number of ISIS fighters at around 31,500.\nRelated: A Trump Presidency Could Give ISIS a Foothold in the USThe data could prove illuminating on two fronts.\nFirst, it might give the U.S. and it allies a better handle on the size of ISIS forces.\nThe files could provide a critical starting point in figuring how ISIS goes about trying to recruit, be it through face-to-face contact, online chat rooms, or other means.\nOf course, the highly-secretive nature surrounding such potential intelligence is a goldmine, and it might be months or years before anyone learns if the files helped lead to reversals in ISIS recruiting efforts."}
