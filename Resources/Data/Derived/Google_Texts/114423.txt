September is National Suicide Prevention Month, and Saturday hundred participated in the Fourth Annual Bridge Walk of Hope in Lynn Haven.

The group 'SPARE' is a local suicide prevention coalition that hosts the fundraiser every year. Their main goal is to let the public know suicide is not the answer, and that help is available.

Panama City Life Management Center and Emerald Coast Behavioral Hospital are two of the organizations who sponsored the event.

Officials say last year, 43 people took their lives in Bay County; and that is one of the highest numbers the area has ever seen.

"It was in 2007 of September and Alex completed suicide. It took me a year to come out of the fog but I started a coalition to prevent suicide and to get the awareness out there and to get the public involved," said Karen Abrahams, co-founder of SPARE.

This is the first year the event took place at the Bailey bridge in the Porter Park area.
