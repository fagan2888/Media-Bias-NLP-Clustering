Two of his male friends gave a laughing grunt, and one took out his phone to capture the moment for re-telling. The idea of women in the beer world is often parodied and, occasionally, openly mocked. But why? There was \u201cbride-ale,\u201d a beer sold at weddings for the bride, and \u201cgroaning\u201d beer, consumed by mothers during labor. The oldest known record of beer brewing comes from Ancient Egypt, where beer was made and sold almost entirely by women. After the colonization of America, women were the family brewers, crafting rich beers from corn, pumpkins, artichokes, oats, wheat, honey, and molasses. Settlers of the colonies drank large quantities of beer as a nutritional break from a diet based largely of salted, smoked and dried meats. Beer was such a staple that there was even something called \u201cbride-ale,\u201d a beer brewed and sold during weddings with all proceeds going to the bride, and \u201cgroaning\u201d beer, which was consumed during and after labor by the midwives and mothers. But as we shifted from an agricultural-based to an industrial-based economy, beer brewing left the privacy of the home and became another commercial, large-scale product run almost entirely by men. At the same time, the variety of beer available became more limited and actually caused most of the unique regional beers that had been developed over centuries to become extinct.\n\nThanks to the \u201cgood food\u201d movement, a push to recognize local, organic, and high quality-flavored food and beverages, there has been a steady increase in craft beer at the expense of large-scale facilities. Because of its emphasis on creative flavors, food pairings, and the DIY hobby culture it steams from, craft beer gives women slightly more opportunity for inclusion\u2014even if bros still struggle to take them seriously. A Question of Taste In Colorado, one of the most brewery-rich states in the country with 154 individual facilities, there are only 10 women total who are known to be a part of the main brewing process. The main obstacles that women continue to face in this industry include perceptions of taste, media influence, and preconceived notions about their skill and ability. For more women to be involved in the beer industry it helps to increase the amount of women drinking beer. According to a recent Gallup poll, only 20 percent of women prefer beer over other alcoholic beverages. \u201cYou have to have a beer drinker before you have a woman beer professional,\u201d says Teri Fahrendorf, President of the Pink Boots Society, an all-female organization to help women in the beer industry. Beer is for guys, as just about any Budweiser or Coors television ad will remind you. The role most often played by women in these spots is either the sexy waitress or the would-be girlfriend. \u201cThe Swedish Bikini Team doesn\u2019t make me thirsty, certainly not for beer,\u201d Fahrendorf says. \u201cTo me, every guy in America who wants to drink beer is already doing it, but every woman who wants to drink beer may not be doing it. It has to start on the consumer level to really grow the industry.\u201d \u201cBeer is universal, it\u2019s probably the second-oldest fermented beverage behind mead and more and more people realize that there is flavor potential there,\u201d says Ginger Johnson, founder and owner of Women Enjoying Beer. Because of the flavor potential and that yearning for local, home brewing has become a popular hobby with over a million people brewing beer at home. Many home brewers take that hobby to the next step and end up opening their own microbrewery. But even though plenty of home-brewers are women there is still skepticism about their roles when it comes to business.", "article_metadata": {"description": "In Ancient Egypt, beer was made almost entirely by women.
