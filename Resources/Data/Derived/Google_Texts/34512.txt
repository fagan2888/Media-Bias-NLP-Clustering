Carly Fiorina responded to being mocked by the hosts of The View on Fox News Sunday this morning by saying conservative women are a big threat to liberals.

After Fiorina joked about being told to smile more at last week’s debate, the View hosts mocked Fiorina for looking “demented” and/or like a Halloween mask. They got criticized both by CNN anchor Brooke Baldwin and ex-View co-host Elisabeth Hasselbeck.

FNS guest host John Roberts asked Fiorina if there’s a “double standard” when it comes to Republican women. Fiorina said of course there is, because “there is nothing more threatening to the liberal media in general and to Hillary Clinton in particular than a conservative woman.”

She said she’s used to it by now and said she wouldn’t mind going on The View to “see if they have the guts to say it to my face.”

Fiorina told Roberts that it’s simply an issue of liberal women who don’t think you “count” as a woman if you’re a Republican, and said, “I am tired of being insulted by liberal feminists who talk about women’s issues when the reality is every issue is a woman’s issue.”
