She then started considering moving to real estate, eventually getting her license and making the change. \u201cI have a degree in business from the University of Wisconsin-Madison and transferring to real estate wasn\u2019t too hard at all. Besides having a business background, my mother and stepfather were in real estate for a long time and I benefit from all their experience and advice,\u201d she said during this edited interview.\n\nWhy did you choose to go into real estate?\n\nIt\u2019s a business where I use my entire skills set, my analytical skills, creative skills and relationship skills every day to help my clients.\n\nHow did running a small business prepare you for selling real estate?\n\nWhen I owned the natural food stores, it was a small business that taught me a lot about all the different hats that you have to wear. It was an ever-growing and changing industry. It learned that in addition to knowing a lot about the current industry, you have to know about what\u2019s coming and to stay current.\n\nWhat do you enjoy most about the real estate profession?\n\nI love the relationships and to me that\u2019s what it\u2019s all about \u2013 getting to know my clients and what it is that they need. It\u2019s a very intimate practice when I\u2019m helping clients look for their next home and trying to help them come to terms with what\u2019s best for them.\n\nHow do you consider yourself to be different than other agents?\n\nIn addition to my skills, I have a vision when viewing my clients\u2019 homes. I use a designer to help me stage the home for no additional fees to the client. I have storage lockers full of furniture and accessories to stage with.\n\nHow does your vision and staging help sell homes?\n\nAccentuating the best features of the home allows prospective buyers to see themselves in the home rather than the seller\u2019s belongings. I come in and help sellers prepare the home to get top dollar. We put the home in its best light by using color and placement.\n\nHow did you fare during the downturn?\n\nMy business actually grew. I paid a great deal of attention to the details, both large and small, and helped my clients do what was needed, from the staging to pricing the home correctly.\n\nWhat are you doing differently today?\n\nI\u2019ve hired a full-time assistant because it\u2019s the only way I can continue providing the high-quality service I like to provide and stay consistent with it.\n\nWhat role should a realtor play for a client?\n\nYou have to play several roles, the first of which is to be a good listener to understand the clients\u2019 needs. Then, it\u2019s important for me to bring my experience and knowledge, empowering them to make the best decision. I also tell them what they may not want to hear, but need to hear \u2013 including when they should not buy a certain home because of its bad quality home or it isn\u2019t right for them.\n\nWhat qualities make for a good realtor?\n\nA good listener, someone who constantly grows in this dynamic market and has a willingness to learn the market and my customers\u2019 needs.\n\n\n\nWhat is your business philosophy?\n\nDo the right thing. It all comes back to the relationship. Show the clients that I really do care about them.\n\nHow have you developed as an agent?\n\nOn multiple levels. In staging, I used to only use accessories and I also use furniture today. I\u2019ve also developed my technology skills to stay on top of this dynamic market.\n\nHas anyone in your career path been a strong mentor?\n\nMy mom and stepfather were my mentors. They assisted me a great deal when I started in this industry and they were so well respected, they had good rapport in the business and broke the ice for me.\n\nWhat is the greatest challenge facing clients right now?\n\nTransactions have become very complicated, as lending and inspections have become more complicated. My job is to help clients navigate and make it less stressful.\n\nWhat\u2019s the most important advice you give to clients?\n\nTo keep their goals in mind along with what they want in their next home. It\u2019s easy to get off track.\n\nWhat is your favorite part of the process?\n\nGetting to know the clients.\n\nHow do you recharge during down time?\n\nI like to work outside and garden. I also exercise and read. I also like to spend time with my family.\n\nWhat charitable groups do you work with?\n\nMy son and I work with kids at the Milwaukee Rescue Mission\u2019s literacy program which has been a great blessing. The kids have been absolutely wonderful.", "article_metadata": {"title": "Paula Noack Langlois, Shorewest Realtors", "og": {"url": "http://www.jsonline.com/homes/realtoroftheweek/295242441.html", "image": {"width": 216, "identifier": "http://media.jrn.com/images/Langlois+Paula.jpg", "height": 324}, "type": "article", "description": "A decade ago, Paula Noack Langlois used to own several natural food stores.
