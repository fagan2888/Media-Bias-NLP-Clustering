REUTERS/Yuri Gripas\n\n4149711\n\nThe Obama administration publicly admitted defeat on price-fixing through the Medicare prescription drug benefit, but some worry they will push forward anyway.\n\n\n\nThe Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) proposed a rule change in January that would negate an extensive Senate battle over federal price-fixing. The Medicare Modernization Act of 2003 strictly bans the federal government from entering into negotiations amongst drugs manufacturers, pharmacies and prescription drug plan (PDP) sponsors, but the Obama administration has tried to assert these powers.\n\nThe Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), parent agency to CMS, \u201cmay not interfere with the negotiations between drug manufacturers and pharmacies and PDP [prescription drug plan] sponsors,\u201d according to the statute. The Obama administration attempted to reinterpret this to allow interference between pharmacies and prescription drug plan sponsors, just not between drug manufacturers and either of the two remaining parties.\n\nA legal opinion from Boyden Gray & Associates \u2014 the law firm of the former White House counsel under President George H.W. Bush \u2014 concluded that the rule was \u201cnot just bad policy,\u201d but \u201cunlawful\u201d as well. After public outcry over the scheme, CMS backed off for 2014.\n\nThe House Energy and Commerce Committee warned CMS Thursday not to implement the rule after the election, requesting a host of documents and information about the agency\u2019s plan.\n\nFormer Congressional Budget Office director Doug Holtz-Eakin believes the window is still wide open for CMS to pull an end-around with the rule change.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re trying to do this through the back door again,\u201d Holtz-Eakin told The Daily Caller News Foundation.\n\nIn January, CMS \u201csent out a call letter that assumed the rule would be enacted,\u201d Holtz Eakin explained to TheDCNF. \u201cOne would think that they will pull the call letter back, and send out a revised one, but they still haven\u2019t done so.\u201d\n\nHoltz-Eakin is worried that the agency, which administrates Medicare, Medicaid, and now the highly revised and reinterpreted Affordable Care Act, will continue its quest to insert itself into the prescription drug industry.\n\nBy failing to send out a revised call for proposals, the agency \u201cleaves the lingering suspicion that while they\u2019ve taken down the rule, they\u2019re trying to get it through\u201d under the radar, Holtz-Eakin told TheDCNF.\n\nHouse Republicans agree. Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Fred Upton and other GOP members sent a letter to CMS administrator Marilyn Tavenner Thursday questioning CMS\u2019 action on the call letter.\n\n\u201cGiven the agency\u2019s failure to consider core concerns about the legal basis, policy rationale, and cost estimates CMS cited when proposing these policy changes, it would be unacceptable for the Administration to move forward with these changes, including directly or indirectly codifying such changes as part of the 2015 call letter,\u201d the congressmen wrote.\n\nThe committee requested that CMS provide a list of documents within the next two weeks, including \u201ca final rule or the agency\u2019s 2015 call letter;\u201d \u201ccost estimates for the proposed rule,\u201d and the agency\u2019s legal rationale for the policy change.\n\nCMS does not plan to fight for the ability to interfere in private negotiations for the remainder of this election year. But Holtz-Eakin said that\u2019s no reason for seniors to feel secure.\n\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t shelve it, they delayed it. To me a battle was won but the war\u2019s not over,\u201d he told TheDCNF. \u201cIt\u2019s just something that hurts seniors \u2014 it\u2019s an election year and they don\u2019t need that battle. But I\u2019m worried about next year now.\u201d\n\nFollow Sarah on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Sarah Hurtubise", "description": "The Obama administration publicly admitted defeat on price-fixing through the Medicare prescription drug benefit, but some worry they will push forward anyway.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "The Obama administration publicly admitted defeat on price-fixing through the Medicare prescription drug benefit, but some worry they will push forward anyway.
