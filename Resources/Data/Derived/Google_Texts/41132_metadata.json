Is there a champion of the left that is unapologetically supportive of their world view?\"\n\nAnd in less than 24 hours, the group found a taker. Self-identified neo-liberal and Daily Caller contributor Mickey Kaus accepted Coulter's challenge, the ACU announced Tuesday afternoon. Kaus and Coulter will go head-to-head at the conference on March 7.\n\nKaus will no doubt face some tough and even inflammatory talk.\n\nA serial rabble-rouser, Coulter once accused Sept. 11 widows of \"reveling in their status as celebrities \u2026 [and] enjoying their husband's death,\" and suggested, \"if only we could get Muslims to boycott all airlines, we could dispense with airport security altogether.\"\n\nShe even joked that \"we need somebody to put rat poisoning in [liberal Supreme Court] Justice [Paul] Stevens' cr\u00e8me brulee\" and said that former Democratic Sen. John Edwards, whose 16-year-old son died in a car accident, must have a bumper sticker that reads, \"Ask me about my dead son.\"\n\nThe American Conservative Union invited would-be challengers for the March 6-8 conference to contact it by phone, e-mail or social media, using the hashtag #CPAC2014.\n\n\"Ann and Mickey are both dynamic political observers and we look forward to continuing the Novak and Donaldson tradition at CPAC,\" said Dan Schneider, Executive Director of the American Conservative Union.", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Wanted: Gutsy Liberal to Debate Ann Coulter", "description": "Wanted: Gutsy Liberal to Debate Ann Coulter", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 ABC News Internet Ventures", "author": "ABC News", "og": {"url": "http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2014/02/wanted-gutsy-liberal-to-debate-ann-coulter/", "site_name": "ABC News", "description": "The firebrand pundit asks a democrat to defend Obama's \"creeping socialism.\"", "title": "Wanted: Gutsy Liberal to Debate Ann Coulter"}, "robots": "index, follow", "fb": {"admins": 704409894, "app_id": 4942312939}, "keywords": "politics news, election news, political news, political news articles", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc833\"", "article_summary": "\"The CPAC stage \u2026 stands ready for a serious liberal willing to defend the creeping socialism of Obama's America,\" the group said in a statement Monday.\nThe American Conservative Union invited would-be challengers for the March 6-8 conference to contact it by phone, e-mail or social media, using the hashtag #CPAC2014.\n(Photo Credit: ABC News)UPDATED: The American Conservative Union, a longtime political lobbying group, went on the hunt for a hot-blooded liberal willing to face off against firebrand conservative pundit Ann Coulter at the annual Conservative Political Action Conference in Washington next month.\n\"Ann and Mickey are both dynamic political observers and we look forward to continuing the Novak and Donaldson tradition at CPAC,\" said Dan Schneider, Executive Director of the American Conservative Union.\nKaus and Coulter will go head-to-head at the conference on March 7."}
