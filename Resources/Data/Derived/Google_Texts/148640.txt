CANNES, France (AP) — Something wicked came the way of the Cannes Film Festival on Saturday when Justin Kurzel premiered his bloody, stylish adaptation of “Macbeth” with Michael Fassbender and Marion Cotillard.

Cannes hailed the premiere of the Australian director’s interpretation of the Shakespeare tragedy, the final film to screen in competition at the festival, which concludes Sunday. The film, among the most eagerly awaited at Cannes, is a grimly visceral adaptation of “Macbeth,” shot partly in Scotland, striking in the bleak beauty of its earthy violence.

To play the Scottish warrior, Fassbender gravitated to the idea that Macbeth suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder. He credited Kurzel for making the connection to contemporary warfare.

“That changed everything for me,” Fassbender told reporters Saturday. “We know from soldiers today coming back from Iraq or Afghanistan that describe post-traumatic stress disorder and the fact that they have these hallucinations. They can be walking down the street here, the Croisette, and the next thing, it’s Basra.”

Cotillard drew the loudest raves for her Lady Macbeth. Hers is a tender version of the character, not the manipulative monster often depicted.

“There’s a lot of love between these two characters,” said Cotillard. “They’re just too damaged to be able to turn toward something more luminous.”

The challenge of tackling Shakespeare was especially steep for the French actress. Fassbender praised her as “the best in the business” and an actress “who brings a grace to everything she does.”
