ensuring their basic human needs are met during long on ground delays,\" the group said on a website containing the petition.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"It must also protect passenger safety by mandating minimum seat pitch standards to preclude ingress/egress and health issues, protect traveling infants and small children by mandating airline acceptance of FAA-certified child seats and provision for their use on all flights, and protect unaccompanied minor air travelers by requiring airlines to provide the services and protections they promise in their Contract of Carriage,\" the website continued.\n\nThe group, which bills itself as the \"largest non-profit airline consumer organization,\" is also calling for Congress to \"address fee and passenger compensation issues, including requiring transparency of all unbundled, ancillary fees, mandating prompt refunds of baggage fees for delayed, lost, damaged or pilfered baggage; and prompt compensation for missing or damaged contents, and requiring refunds of taxes, PFCs, and surcharges for non-refundable tickets when flights are cancelled.\n\n\"Moreover, public law must mandate increased compensation for involuntary 'bumping'; and the airlines\u2019 ability to oversell seats,\" the group said.\n\nThe petition has collected 31,284 signatures as of Tuesday afternoon.\n\nThe group that lobbies for airlines in Washington, Airlines for America, dismmissed the passenger rights petition as a call for an unnecessary federal intrusion into their nation's aviation industry.\n\n\"The government's role in seat sizes for all forms of transportation (car, bus, rail and air) is to determine what is safe,\" the group said in a statement that was provided to The Hill, pointing out that the Department of Transportation has recently declined to weigh in on the seat size issue.\n\n\"The FAA has made that determination,\" the airline group's statement continued. \"As the safest mode of transportation safety is always our highest priority.\"\n\n-Updated with new information at 3:28 p.m.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "A group called FlyRights.org is asking Congress to mandate more seat space on flights.", "description": "A group called FlyRights.org is asking Congress to mandate more seat space on flights.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Keith Laing", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "A group called FlyRights.org is asking Congress to mandate more seat space on flights.", "title": "Passenger group petitioning for bigger airplane seats", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/transportation/252939-passenger-group-petitioning-for-bigger-airplane-seats", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/article_images/airplane_interior_travel_052814thinkstock.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-04T05:25:59-05:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-04T05:25-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/transportation/252939-passenger-group-petitioning-for-bigger-airplane-seats", "dcterms.date": "2015-09-08T14:07-04:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Keith Laing", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Airlines, Airplane seat space,,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-09-08T14:07:29-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-04T05:25:59-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/transportation/252939-passenger-group-petitioning-for-bigger-airplane-seats", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "A group called FlyRights.org is asking Congress to mandate more seat space on flights.", "card": "summary", "title": "Passenger group petitioning for bigger airplane seats"}, "dcterms.title": "Passenger group petitioning for bigger airplane seats"}, "article_summary": "A group that advocates for airline passengers is petitioning Congress to require airlines to provide bigger seats on flights.\n\"Moreover, public law must mandate increased compensation for involuntary 'bumping';
