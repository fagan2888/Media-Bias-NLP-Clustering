The topic is unclear because of redactions, but Clinton is plainly anxious to get her hands on a set of talking points being developed for her.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll get tps this eve. They\u2019re coming together,\u201d Sullivan wrote at 5:51 p.m. on June 16.\n\nAt 7:52 the next morning, Clinton replied, \u201cI didn\u2019t get the TPs yet.\u201d\n\nSullivan informs his boss that the Department has had trouble sending the talking points through its system for secure fax messaging.\n\n\u201cIf they can\u2019t, turn into nonpaper w no identifying heading and send nonsecure,\u201d Clinton replied.\n\nRelated: The Benghazi Investigation Reaches a Dubious Milestone\n\nThe reaction among Clinton critics was quick and fierce. On its face, the former Secretary of State appears to be directing her staff to take material that they plainly believed ought to be sent via a secure method, and send it via a method that might make it susceptible to interception by unintended recipients.\n\nSen. Tom Cotton (R-AR) said in a statement, \u201cOnce again it\u2019s clear Hillary Clinton prioritizes her personal convenience over national security. It\u2019s as if she thinks the rules just don\u2019t apply to her and is hypocrisy of the highest order. Any other federal employee found acting in such a manner would likely have their clearance revoked, employment terminated, and could face prosecution. Instead, Hillary Clinton is in the running for a major promotion. It\u2019s likely the more our enemies learn about her disregard for classified material, the more they are hoping she wins the presidency.\u201d\n\nSenate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-IA), also in a press release, said,\n\n\u201cThe State Department\u2019s latest Freedom of Information Act release contains a disturbing email that appears to show the former Secretary of State instructing a subordinate to remove the headings from a classified document and send it to her in an unsecure manner. It raises a host of serious questions and underscores the importance of the various inquiries into the transmittal of classified information through her non-government email server. How long has the State Department been aware of this email? Why is it just now being released? Was her instruction actually carried out? If so, has the FBI opened a criminal inquiry into these circumstances? President Obama\u2019s State and Justice Departments owe the American people swift and accurate answers to these questions. The former Secretary of State needs to finally come clean and be transparent about the email practices she used during her tenure at the department.\u201d\n\nRelated: Trump Gives Clinton a Boost as He Takes Aim at Gowdy on Benghazi\n\nHowever, it\u2019s not clear that the request was quite the smoking gun Clinton\u2019s critics think it was. In her email, the former secretary directed staff to turn the talking points into \u201cnon-paper\u201d before sending it through non-secure channels. In the State Department, the term \u201cnon-paper\u201d appears to have a pretty specific meaning.\n\nAs about 30 seconds on Google will reveal, the Department of State Foreign Affairs Manual defines non-paper as, \u201cA written summary of a demarche or other verbal presentation to a foreign government. The non-paper should be drafted in the third person, and must not be directly attributable to the U.S. Government. It is prepared on plain paper (no letterhead or watermark). The heading or title, if any, is simply a statement of the issue or subject. (For example: \u2018Genetically-Modified Organisms.\u2019)\u201d\n\nIf what Clinton was doing in that email was specifying that the talking points were to be turned into an anodyne statement of facts that the department felt comfortable sharing with a foreign government \u2013 and that seems pretty likely given the context \u2013 it\u2019s probably a stretch to suggest that the FBI will be opening a criminal inquiry about it anytime soon.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Opponents of leading Democratic presidential contender Hillary Clinton believe they ha", "title": "The Latest Clinton Email \u2018Smoking Gun\u2019 May Be All Smoke", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/01/08/Latest-Clinton-Email-Smoking-Gun-May-Be-All-Smoke", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/redacted_fax_istockphot.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/01/08/Latest-Clinton-Email-Smoking-Gun-May-Be-All-Smoke", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/redacted_fax_istockphot.jpg", "creator": "@rrgarver", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Opponents of leading Democratic presidential contender Hillary Clinton believe they ha", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "\u201cIf they can\u2019t, turn into nonpaper w no identifying heading and send nonsecure,\u201d Clinton replied.\nThe topic is unclear because of redactions, but Clinton is plainly anxious to get her hands on a set of talking points being developed for her.\nIn her email, the former secretary directed staff to turn the talking points into \u201cnon-paper\u201d before sending it through non-secure channels.\nHow long has the State Department been aware of this email?\nIn the State Department, the term \u201cnon-paper\u201d appears to have a pretty specific meaning."}
