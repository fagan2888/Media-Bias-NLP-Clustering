DURANGO, Colo. (AP) — A fish habitat in Durango has filed a lawsuit against oil and gas companies they blame for a 2014 fish die-off.

Little Fishes Wildlife Habitat says contaminated runoff from nearby well pads seeped into ponds and killed the rainbow trout.

The complaint names four oil and gas companies, including Catamount Energy Partners, ConocoPhillips Company, Williams Four Corners and SG Interests. All refused to comment on the lawsuit.

The Durango Herald reports (http://tinyurl.com/zdtds97) the cause of the die-off remains undetermined because it’s unknown what chemicals the oil and gas companies were using.
