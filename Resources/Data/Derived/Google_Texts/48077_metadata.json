They had added one player, safety Duke Ihenacho, on a waiver claim. And although players can always be released or signed during the season, the moves offered a brief sense of finality before Sunday\u2019s season-opener in Houston.\n\n\u201cThere were some battles that were very close that we could\u2019ve gone in a couple different directions, but decisions have to be made,\u201d Gruden said. \u201cI feel like Bruce [Allen], myself, the coaches, we did a good job of talking through every scenario, numbers-wise. \u2026 I think we did a good job. But only time will tell.\u201d\n\nSEE ALSO: New punter Way has a Redskins past\n\nAfter a fierce competition at running back, the Redskins decided to keep only three players \u2014 Alfred Morris, Roy Helu and undrafted rookie Silas Redd \u2014 on their active roster. Chris Thompson, who missed much of the preseason with an ankle injury, was signed to the team\u2019s practice squad.\n\nIn the process, Washington cut three-year veteran Evan Royster and sixth-round draft pick Lache Seastrunk. Releasing Seastrunk, and also choosing not to sign him to the practice squad, drew ire from some fans after his 80-yard touchdown catch in the team\u2019s preseason finale.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not over for Lache,\u201d Gruden said. \u201cI\u2019m sure somebody will get a look at him, and it could be us later on. But we\u2019ll see. \u2026 We feel good about the three guys we kept.\u201d\n\nThe Redskins decided to keep Thompson on the practice squad with hopes that he will be able to stay healthy. Gruden said Thompson could be activated \u201csooner than later\u201d if he answers the questions surrounding his durability.\n\nThe team added two more players to its practice squad Monday \u2014 safety Akeem Davis, who was waived Sunday to make room for Ihenacho, and linebacker Chaz Sutton, an undrafted free agent out of South Carolina who was waived last week by the Buccaneers.\n\nGruden was pleased with the addition of Ihenacho, a strong safety who was released by the Denver Broncos. Ihenacho started 17 games for the Broncos last season, including the Super Bowls. He finished with 67 tackles, three forced fumbles and nine passes defended.\n\n\u201cI think he brings some experience to the table,\u201d Gruden said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t know who was going to come available. We saw that he was there, we put a claim in to him because of the experience level and special teams experience. We thought he could be an immediate help for us, and luckily we got him.\u201d\n\nDepending on his comfort level with the defensive playbook, Ihenacho said he could start at strong safety on Sunday in place of Brandon Meriweather, who is suspended for the first two weeks of the regular season. But Gruden said the Redskins did not claim Ihenacho specifically to help replace their suspended starter. The 25-year-old is expected to primarily contribute on special teams.\n\nWhile Ihenacho joined the team at practice, several other defensive players worked on an auxiliary field because of injuries. Cornerback Tracy Porter re-injured his hamstring on Saturday, Gruden said, and the team is taking a cautious approach with him.\n\nLinebacker Akeem Jordan, who sprained his knee against Tampa Bay, also practiced on the side field. Gruden was unsure whether Jordan would be able to play Sunday.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know yet. We\u2019ll have to see how he\u2019s doing [Wednesday],\u201d Gruden said. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of a day-to-day thing with it, and we\u2019ll go from there.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Jay Gruden talks about the process of whittling Washington's roster to 53 players and the addition of former Broncos safety Duke Ihenacho.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Jay Gruden talks about the process of whittling Washington\u2019s roster to 53 players and the addition of former Broncos safety Duke Ihenacho.", "title": "Jay Gruden, Washington Redskins welcome Duke Ihenacho after busy weekend of roster moves", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/sep/1/jay-gruden-washington-redskins-welcome-duke-ihenac/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/08/31/ap34025670030.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/08/31/ap34025670030.jpg", "description": "Jay Gruden talks about the process of whittling Washington's roster to 53 players and the addition of former Broncos safety Duke Ihenacho.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Jay Gruden, Washington Redskins welcome Duke Ihenacho after busy weeke"}, "Author": "Tom Schad", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Sports, Jay Gruden, Duke Ihenacho, Washington Redskins, Chris Thompson"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdbbdc\"", "article_summary": "Chris Thompson, who missed much of the preseason with an ankle injury, was signed to the team\u2019s practice squad.\nIn the previous 72 hours, first-year coach Jay Gruden and his staff had whittled a 75-man roster to 53 players and an eight-man practice squad.\nBut Gruden said the Redskins did not claim Ihenacho specifically to help replace their suspended starter.\nWhile Ihenacho joined the team at practice, several other defensive players worked on an auxiliary field because of injuries.\nGruden was pleased with the addition of Ihenacho, a strong safety who was released by the Denver Broncos."}
