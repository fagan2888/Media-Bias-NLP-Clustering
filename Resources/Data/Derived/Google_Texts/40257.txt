Rush Limbaugh, Glenn Beck and Sean Hannity have all placed on the latest release of Forbes’ “World’s Most Powerful Celebrities” list, proving that conservative talk radio — not print, television or digital media — is the place for the most influential.

Mr. Beck came in at No. 39, between musical performer Pharrell Williams and NFL quarterback Peyton Manning, Politico reported. Forbes’ cited Mr. Beck with $90 million in earnings.

Mr. Limbaugh, meanwhile, hit the list with $66 million in earnings at No. 59, right behind celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay and right before Jon Stewart of “The Daily Show.” Mr. Hannity rounded out the top conservative radio talkers on the list, at No. 86, with $30 million in earnings, Politico said.

Names that went noticeably missing from the list: News media’s Brian Williams, Diane Sawyer and other easily recognizable faces. Fox News’ Bill O’Reilly, who frequently dominates the television cable ratings but no longer has a radio show, was also absent from the list.
