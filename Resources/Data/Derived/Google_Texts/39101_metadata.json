At the same time, the judge also found that the school had wrongfully excluded the student from ancillary business operations \u2013 including its library, counseling center, and restaurants \u2013 which are subject to the state\u2019s nondiscrimination law.\n\nTwenty-seven-year-old Domaine Javier, who was born a biological male but has identified as female since childhood, was awarded the minimum statutory damages of $4,000 Friday in a ruling that backed California Baptist University (CBU) on four out of five claims against it.\n\nJavier had sued the university, where she was pursuing a nursing degree, for expelling her on fraud violations in 2011. The expulsion followed her appearance on the MTV reality show, \u201cTrue Life,\u201d where Javier publicly identified as transgender. Both Javier\u2019s driver\u2019s license, and Social Security records reflect that she is female.\n\nBy expelling her, Javier\u2019s attorneys argued, CBU had violated California\u2019s Unruh Civil Rights Act, which protects individuals from discrimination by any business establishment on the basis of age, ancestry, color, disability, genetic information, medical condition, marital status, national origin, race, religion, sex, and sexual orientation. The statute also explicitly states that protections based on sex include \u201cgender, gender identity and gender expression.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s these types of laws that some fear are at risk of becoming irrelevant in the wake of the Supreme Court\u2019s Hobby Lobby decision, which affirmed the right of closely held corporations to opt out of the Affordable Care Act\u2019s contraceptive mandate on religious grounds. If businesses like Hobby Lobby are allowed to deny employees birth control coverage because of a religious objection to contraception, as Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg pointed out in her dissent, what\u2019s to stop them from opting \u201cout of any law they judge incompatible with their sincerely held religious beliefs?\u201d Close video Transgender woman: Hobby Lobby discriminates Out There: In this week\u2019s LGBT wrap-up with Thomas Roberts, organizers hold a blood drive for gay and bisexual men, another Hobby Lobby lawsuit comes to the forefront, a Colorado judge strikes down the state\u2019s marriage ban, a Burger King wrapper\u2026 embed like save share group\n\nCivil libertarians and legal analysts see potential for the Hobby Lobby ruling to reverberate throughout the LGBT community.\n\nIn her Friday ruling, Superior Court Judge Gloria Connor Trask concluded that CBU was not a \u201cbusiness establishment\u201d subject to Unruh\u2019s regulations, at least not when it comes to on-campus educational activities.\n\n\u201cEvery secular subject is expressly intertwined with a values-based Christian religious component, taught by a Christian,\u201d wrote Trask in her 11-page decision. \u201cWhatever economic benefit the student hopes to gain from the CBU educational experience, CBU clearly intends to send forth an engineer, nurse, businessperson, or teacher who will be able to apply its religious values in the secular world.\u201d\n\nBased on that logic, Trask denied Javier\u2019s claims that the school had violated Unruh in suspending and expelling her. However, Trask did side with Javier on a third claim \u2013 that CBU had violated Unruh in excluding her from restaurants, libraries, online classes, and other ancillary activities operating as \u201cbusiness establishments,\u201d open to the public.\n\n\u201cThey are essentially indistinguishable from similar commercial activities in the community,\u201d wrote Trask. \u201cStill, these ancillary programs, although open to the public, do not grant members of the public access to CBU\u2019s faith-based undergraduate program, and do not transform CBU\u2019s faith-based undergraduate program into a business establishment.\u201d\n\nAt a time when religious objections to LGBT rights appear to be turning into the next front for the equality movement, Javier and her legal team were happy with their partial victory. Attorney Paul Southwick saw the ruling as a departure from the Supreme Court\u2019s deference to religious exemptions, as seen in its recent Hobby Lobby decision.\n\n\u201cToday is a great day for transgender Californians,\u201d said Southwick in a statement. \u201c[Judge Trask] refused to recognize a Hobby Lobby type exemption for the university, at least with respect to online courses and parts of the university that are open to the public, like its library, counseling center and campus restaurants.\u201d\n\nSouthwick said he and his co-counselors plan on appealing the claims they lost, on the grounds that CBU accepts state and federal aid and should be subject to nondiscrimination laws in publicly funded education programs.\n\nAs for Javier, she said she was \u201cthrilled\u201d with the outcome.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s such a huge victory for me personally and for other transgender people like me,\u201d said Javier in a statement. \u201cWhile the monetary award is small, it\u2019s never been about the money for me. It\u2019s about being treated fairly and standing up for what\u2019s right.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "description": "A private, Christian school was within its rights to expel a transgender student.
