Ted Cruz.\n\nBut the Republican candidates for Texas attorney general can\u2019t get close enough.\n\nJust two days after the shutdown deal, candidate Ken Paxton announced that he had recruited Kaye T. Goolsby to his campaign team.\n\nThe veteran organizer was statewide grass-roots director for Cruz\u2019s 2012 Senate campaign, a fact that the news release from Paxton, a state senator from McKinney, made sure to point out. Goolsby will be chairman of his statewide leadership team.\n\nCruz\u2019s effort to get Republicans to subscribe to an ill-fated strategy of trying to defund the Affordable Care Act made him one of the most divisive political figures in the country. His approval ratings are dismal among many voter groups.\n\nBut in the Lone Star State, fellow Republicans are treating the junior senator\u2019s name like gold.\n\nNowhere is that more evident than the race for attorney general. Candidates have taken most of the summer to roll out various endorsements. Supporters with connections to Cruz get all-star treatment.\n\n\u201cCruz is popular in Texas, and it\u2019s a nod to the influence of the tea party,\u201d said Dallas County Republican Party Chairman Wade Emmert. \u201cWhenever you look at running statewide, the rural areas come into play. And the tea party and Ted Cruz are extremely influential in the state\u2019s rural areas.\u201d\n\nLawyers and politicians associated with Cruz are sought after more than most.\n\nRep. Dan Branch, R-Dallas, recently developed a \u201cconstitutional leadership team\u201d that included a list of 10 of Cruz\u2019s former legal and campaign advisers.\n\nBranch, one of the top Republicans in the Texas House, is trying to shore up his tea party support.\n\nPaxton is banking his campaign on his tea party connections. The third major candidate, Railroad Commission Chairman Barry Smitherman, is trying to get to the right of anyone in the race.\n\nThe way it\u2019s going, Texas GOP candidates may start adding Cruz\u2019s valet, mechanic and the barista who makes his coffee to their list of supporters.\n\nSo why are GOP strongholds like Texas so enamored of Cruz, even as he plummets elsewhere? Texas Republicans dislike President Barack Obama, the Affordable Care Act, U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev.\n\nThough his tactics are questionable, Cruz has become the anti-Obama.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s two sides of the same coin,\u201d Emmert said. \u201cIt\u2019s the popularity of Cruz along with the unpopularity of President Obama, the Justice Department and Eric Holder.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s only fitting that the attorney general\u2019s race be flavored by Cruz.\n\nIn 2010, when Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison was expected to resign to fully focus on running for governor, triggering a host of down-ballot moves, Cruz and Branch were candidates to replace Greg Abbott as attorney general.\n\nBut Hutchison stayed put, eventually losing the race for governor. And when she decided against another term in the Senate, Cruz, a former solicitor general under Abbott, decided to run for Senate instead of waiting to see if the attorney general\u2019s post would open.\n\nNow it has. But Cruz is in the Senate and has become the most popular Republican in Texas.\n\nAnd with the exception of his barber, everyone associated with him is in demand.\n\nFollow Gromer Jeffers Jr. on Twitter at @gromerjeffers.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Even as the Texas senator\u2019s popularity wanes elsewhere, hopefuls here want to be associated with the tea party favorite.", "og": {"description": "Even as the Texas senator\u2019s popularity wanes elsewhere, hopefuls here want to be associated with the tea party favorite.", "title": "Texas attorney general candidates highlight ties to Ted Cruz", "url": "http://www.dallasnews.com/news/columnists/gromer-jeffers-jr/20131021-texas-attorney-general-candidates-highlight-ties-to-ted-cruz.ece", "image": {"width": 345, "identifier": "http://www.dallasnews.com/resrsc/images/facebook-default.jpg", "height": 345}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "type": "article"}, "LastModifiedDate": "2013-10-22T03:44:47Z", "twitter": {"site": "@dallasnews", "card": "summary", "creator": "@dallasnews"}, "PublishDate": "2013-10-22T03:44:41Z", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Texas attorney general candidates highlight ties to Ted Cruz\", \"link\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/news/columnists/gromer-jeffers-jr/20131021-texas-attorney-general-candidates-highlight-ties-to-ted-cruz.ece\", \"image_url\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/resrsc/images/facebook-default.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"1255303\", \"pub_date\": \"2013-10-22T03:44:41Z\", \"section\": \"Gromer Jeffers Jr.\", \"author\": \"Gromer Jeffers Jr.\", \"tags\": [\"dallas\", \"dallas fort worth\", \"dallas news\", \"dallas fort worth news\", \"dfw news\", \"dallas local news\", \"dallas fort worth local news\", \"dallas newspaper\", \"dallas morning news\", \"dallas morning news newspaper\"]}", "fb": {"admins": 1043783589, "page_id": 20946638799, "app_id": 258290334265148}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "cXenseParse": {"recs": {"image": "http://www.dallasnews.com/resrsc/images/facebook-default.jpg", "publishtime": "2013-10-22T03:44:41Z"}}, "news_keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde00e\"", "article_summary": "But the Republican candidates for Texas attorney general can\u2019t get close enough.\nTexas Republicans dislike President Barack Obama, the Affordable Care Act, U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev.\nNowhere is that more evident than the race for attorney general.\nAnd the tea party and Ted Cruz are extremely influential in the state\u2019s rural areas.\u201dLawyers and politicians associated with Cruz are sought after more than most.\n\u201cCruz is popular in Texas, and it\u2019s a nod to the influence of the tea party,\u201d said Dallas County Republican Party Chairman Wade Emmert."}
