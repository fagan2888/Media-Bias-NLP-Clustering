The Washington Farm Labor Association will hold its annual Workforce Summit on H-2A visa guestworker issues in Ellensburg on Jan. 28 and in Canby, Ore., Jan. 26.

ELLENSBURG, Wash. — Agricultural employers may learn more about the Washington Farm Labor Association’s H-2A visa foreign guestworker program at the association’s annual Workforce Summit at Central Washington University, Jan. 28.

H-2A will be introduced to employers considering it for the first time. Those who have used it will share experiences. Housing, transportation, recruitment, wages and other aspects of the program will be explained.

Those planning to attend should register by the end of December at www.wafla.org.

WAFLA also will hold the summit in Canby, Ore., Jan. 26, at a location yet to be determined.

The association will hold its annual Labor Conference at CWU in Ellensburg, Feb. 18. Immigration, the Affordable Care Act, rest break pay for piece rate workers and proposals to increase the state’s minimum wage will be discussed.

Sexual harassment will be discussed. Starting Jan. 1, WAFLA is offering a sexual harassment hotline to growers for as little as $250 per year. It insulates growers from being accused of doing nothing about complaints, said Dan Fazio, WAFLA director.
