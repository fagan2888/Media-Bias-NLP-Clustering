This law is really leaving those with employer insurance, those with government insurance alone. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re talking about a small minority of Americans that buy insurance on their own through the individual market.\n\n\n\nCHUCK TODD: Still millions of people.\n\n\n\nGRUBER: Exactly. It's 12 million people, about a third of which will end up paying more under this law. And that as you said in the introductions sort of the idea. We currently have a highly discriminatory system where if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re sick, if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been sick or [if] you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re going to get sick, you cannot get health insurance.\n\n\n\nThe only way to end that discriminatory system is to bring everyone into the system and pay one fair price. That means that the genetic winners, the lottery winners who've been paying an artificially low price because of this discrimination now will have to pay more in return. And that, by my estimate, is about four million people. In return, we'll have a fixed system where over 30 million people will now for the first time be able to access fairly price and guaranteed health insurance.", "article_metadata": {"description": "JONATHAN GRUBER, MIT: Let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s start with understanding that we are not talking about the vast majority of Americans.
