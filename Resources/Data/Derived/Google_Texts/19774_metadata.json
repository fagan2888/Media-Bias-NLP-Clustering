Riverside Ave. or in Coeur d\u2019Alene at 608 Northwest Blvd.\n\n\u2022 Online: www.spokesman.com/christmas-fund . Online donations can be made with a PayPal account or credit card. (A processing charge of 2.9 percent plus 30 cents will be deducted.)\n\nThe Christmas Bureau is closed for 2013, but fundraising to pay for the toys, books and grocery vouchers continues through noon Monday\n\nMary Englehart lost her health insurance in 2009, shortly after getting an MRI to monitor a cyst on her brain.\n\n\u201dI had bad headaches and I had a seizure,\u201d she said, noting when she still had medical coverage she saw a neurologist who prescribed migraine medication and biannual MRIs to monitor any growth of the cyst.\n\nBut Englehart only had two of the diagnostic scans before her insurance ended. Without it, she can\u2019t afford to see the doctor, get an MRI or purchase the medicine that minimized her headaches.\n\n\u201cI stopped taking my meds after I lost the insurance,\u201d she explained, adding that they\u2019re getting worse, which makes her worry that the cyst has grown. She\u2019s also worried about her blood pressure: Last week, the self-service machine in the grocery store showed it at 170/100.\n\nThat\u2019s why Englehart stopped by the health insurance table for help after she received a $15 food voucher at the Christmas Bureau, which will help her buy a holiday turkey or the ingredients for her glorified rice recipe.\n\nFunded by community donations and organized by The Spokesman-Review, Catholic Charities and Volunteers of America, the Christmas Bureau distributes books, toys and food vouchers so needy families have hope for a merry Christmas. It served more than 30,000 people this season.\n\nWith an average reported household income of $1,168 per month, most of the charity\u2019s recipients qualify for health insurance under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nKnowing this, Catholic Charities and Volunteers of America, provided four in-person assistors with computers to answer questions, trouble-shoot sign-up issues and walk recipients through the insurance application process on the ACA website for Washington state.\n\nCatholic Charities and Volunteers of America received grant funding from Providence Health Care and Empire Health Foundation, respectively, to help low-income and underserved populations apply for health coverage under the ACA.\n\n\u201cThis year at the Christmas Bureau we gave the best Christmas present we\u2019ve ever given in the history of the Christmas Bureau,\u201d said Catholic Charities executive director Rob McCann. \u201cWe gave out health care.\u201d\n\nAccording to Matt Olson, one of three in-person assistors from Catholic Charities who came to the Christmas Bureau, this will help more needy, vulnerable people get appropriate care to prevent and manage disease.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re keeping them out of the ER. Preventative care can keep them from hospital stays,\u201d he explained, adding that accessing appropriate health care is essential to helping people become productive, contributing members of society.\n\n\u201cIf you haven\u2019t had medical or dental care, try to get a job,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have to have boots before you can pull yourself up by the bootstraps.\u201d\n\nBetween the four of them, VOA assistor Jalen Pace estimated they helped about 60 people successfully apply for insurance at the Christmas Bureau. He said they also provided information or application follow-up to more than 500 people over the charity\u2019s nine day run at the fairgrounds, helping people like Englehart get health coverage.\n\nNew donations\n\nThis year, the Christmas Bureau distributed toys for 15,266 needy children and $15 to $30 food vouchers to 9,218 low-income households. The charity is near the $525,000 needed to fund the books, toys and vouchers given this month, with almost $480,000 received from over 1,400 people, groups or businesses, including the following new donors:\n\nStella, AJ, Joe, Julia and Colt, of Spokane, gave $9,709.70 via PayPal, to \u201chelp those that need it in Spokane.
