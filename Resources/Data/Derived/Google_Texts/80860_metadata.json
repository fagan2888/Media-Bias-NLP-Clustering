So what went wrong with the implementation of the president\u2019s signature domestic accomplishment and how can the administration save it? Below is your guide to Obamacare\u2019s bumpy rollout:\n\nWhat\u2019s the problem.\n\nWhen HealthCare.gov first launched on Oct. 1, administration officials were surprised by the initial surge in public interest, as millions of Americans logged on to the site in search of coverage. Unfortunately, that\u2019s as far as they got \u2014 for the overwhelming majority of users, the site crashed, ran too slowly, or simply froze. The federal website required users to create accounts before applying for coverage, creating a bottleneck of traffic and preventing visitors from browsing plans anonymously. Over the weekend, administration officials took the website down and added additional capacity. But the glitches didn\u2019t end there. While more people were able to enroll, insurers complained about receiving duplicate enrollments, missing data fields, and other errors. The website also \u201cgives inaccurate information\u201d about the federal tax credits and sometimes \u201cerroneously tells low-income people that they are not eligible for Medicaid.\u201d The website is also \u201chaving trouble handling applications from people who are offered coverage through their jobs but could find better or less-expensive health plans through the new marketplace.\u201d\n\nWhat went wrong.\n\nWhile it\u2019s not clear why HealthCare.gov did not anticipate the surge of traffic, computer experts are attributing some of the problems to the use of outdated technology, last-minute testing of software, messy coding, and an inability to integrate different aspects of the site. Officials with knowledge of the implementation process have also questioned the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services\u2019 ability to coordinate pieces of software from 55 contractors charged with writing code for different aspects of the project. \u201cIt is not common for a federal agency to assume that role, and numerous people involved in the project said the agency did not have the expertise to do the job and did not fully understand what it entailed,\u201d the Washington Post reported.\n\nThe good news.\n\nUninsured individuals have until March 31 to sign-up for coverage. The administration says that it\u2019s working around the clock to fix the problems and has hired \u201cthe best and brightest\u201d tech experts to help fix the website. The homepage now allows individuals to window shop for plans, with a \u201csee plans now\u201d button that links to examples of pre-tax credit prices for all available plans by zip code. Users also have the option to \u201capply online\u201d or \u201capply by phone.\u201d\n\nAlmost half a million people have already begun applying for health insurance through federal and state exchanges, though the state-run marketplaces are more adapt at quickly fixing problems and making big changes. If state news reports are any indication, uninsured individuals appear to be encountering plans that offer more benefits and cost less than previous forms of coverage.\n\nAlso, the federal government has faced health care enrollment issues in the past. When President Bush sought to implement Medicare Part D, the program extending prescription drug coverage to the Medicare population, lower-income beneficiaries were unable to access needed drugs. The administration moved quickly to resolve the problems, allowing top officials to testify before Congressional committees. Eventually, seniors signed up for the program and now view it favorably.\n\nThe bad news.\n\nSome contractors tell the New York Times they \u201cworry that the system may be weeks away from operating smoothly\u201d and could require a major overhaul to function properly. Administration officials \u201chave been debating whether to designate one or more companies as the quarterback for information technology work on the federal exchange,\u201d the paper notes, though CMS has begun \u201cnegotiating agreements with contractors on responsibility and deadlines for repairs\u201d and hope to have a plan before Thursday.\n\nMeanwhile, thousands of Americans who buy insurance on the individual marketplace are receiving cancellation notices. Insurance companies are claiming that the policies \u2014 some of which offer skimpy benefit packages \u2014 fall short of what the Affordable Care Act requires starting Jan. 1,\u201d though some may be ending certain plans to shed risky (and expensive) beneficiaries. Under reform, most individuals should be able to find more comprehensive insurance at lower rates, though many are having trouble logging on and enrolling in coverage.\n\nIf the website is not fixed in a matter of weeks, administration officials will fail in enrolling the estimated 7 million uninsured Americans who are expected to enroll in coverage by 2014. The glitches and technical problems could also keep healthy people \u2014 who are critical to maintaining risk balance in the marketplaces \u2014 from signing up for coverage, significantly increasing premiums.\n\nWhat\u2019s next.\n\nOn Thursday, the House Energy and Commerce Committee will hold a hearing titled, \u201cImplementation Failures: Didn\u2019t Know or Didn\u2019t Disclose?\u201d reviewing some of the challenges in enacting the law. Conservative groups have also launched state-based campaigns to convince young people to avoid signing-up for coverage and prevent states from expanding their Medicaid programs. Meanwhile, the Associated Press reports that administration cabinet officials prepare to travel throughout the country encouraging people to sign-up for insurance.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "What went wrong with the implementation of the president's signature domestic accomplishment and how can the administration save it?", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "What went wrong with the implementation of the president's signature domestic accomplishment and how can the administration save it?", "title": "Your Guide To Obamacare\u2019s Bumpy Rollout", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/health/2013/10/21/2807661/guide-obamacare-rollout-debacle/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/obamacare-enrollment-e1375725690304.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "What went wrong with the implementation of the president's signature domestic accomplishment and how can the administration save it?", "title": "Your Guide To Obamacare\u2019s Bumpy Rollout", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/obamacare-enrollment-e1375725690304-321x214.jpg", "creator": "@@igorvolsky", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-health", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/obamacare-enrollment-e1375725690304.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/obamacare-enrollment-e1375725690304.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2013-10-21T09:32:28+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/ivolsky"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde695\"", "article_summary": "Health Your Guide To Obamacare\u2019s Bumpy Rollout CREDIT: Jessica Rinaldi/ReutersAs President Obama acknowledges the error-riddled roll out of HealthCare.gov during an address in the Rose Garden on Monday, administration officials insist that they are working overtime to fix the technical glitches associated with enrolling online.\nBelow is your guide to Obamacare\u2019s bumpy rollout:What\u2019s the problem.\nOver the weekend, administration officials took the website down and added additional capacity.\nThe federal website required users to create accounts before applying for coverage, creating a bottleneck of traffic and preventing visitors from browsing plans anonymously.\nMeanwhile, the Associated Press reports that administration cabinet officials prepare to travel throughout the country encouraging people to sign-up for insurance."}
