The Wall Street Journal\n\nDemocratic senators find the Washington Redskins team name offensive enough to ask the National Football League to order a change. But how do they feel about the other Indian-themed teams back in their home states?\n\nSen. Sherrod Brown (D., Ohio) was among the 50 senators who signed a letter to the NFL calling for the end of the Redskins name. In the Buckeye State, Mr. Brown doesn\u2019t object to the Cleveland Indians\u2018 name \u2014 but he does want the baseball team\u2019s controversial logo, Chief Wahoo, to go, spokeswoman Megan Dubyak said Thursday.\n\nSign up for the Capital Journal Daybreak newsletter, straight to your inbox: http://on.wsj.com/CapitalJournalSignup\n\nMr. Brown has been opposed to the Chief Wahoo logo since the 1990s, Ms. Dubyak said. He\u2019s hardly the only Ohioan calling for it to go: In February the Cleveland Plain Dealer editorial page said the team should retire the logo.\n\nChief Wahoo, a toothy Native American caricature, has been the subject of scorn in recent years. The team has de-emphasized its use, changing its primary logo to a block C this season but retaining the symbol on jersey sleeves and on hats worn for home games.\n\nIndians spokesman Curtis Danberg said the team has no plans to eliminate Chief Wahoo from its uniforms and hats.\n\n\u201cWe are very cognizant and sensitive to both sides of the conversation \u2013 our fans deep, long lasting attachment to the memories associated with Chief Wahoo and those who are opposed to its use,\u201d he said. \u201cWe continue to research our fan base to better understand their perception and stance on the logo, but at present time have no plans of making a change.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Sen. Claire McCaskill (D., Mo.), who signed the Redskins letter, doesn\u2019t find the Kansas City Chiefs\u2018 name offensive, said spokesman John LaBombard. The NFL team plays at Arrowhead Stadium and has a horse named Warpaint at their games.\n\n\u201cIn our view, the word Chiefs does not carry the same negative stigma as Redskins,\u201d Mr. LaBombard said. \u201cAnd we have not heard from tribes or other stakeholders offended by the Chiefs name. Redskins is a racial slur and simply should go.\u201d\n\nThe other Major League Baseball team with an Indian theme is the Atlanta Braves. Georgia\u2019s senators, Johnny Isakson and Saxby Chambliss, are both Republicans, so they didn\u2019t have a chance to weigh in on the Redskins Thursday: Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D., Nev.) only circulated the Redskins letter to the Democratic caucus.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "Democratic senators find the Washington Redskins team name offensive enough to ask the NFL to order a change.
