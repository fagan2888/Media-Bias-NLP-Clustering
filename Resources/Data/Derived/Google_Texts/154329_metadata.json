A trillion tax dollars saved his donor pals at Goldman Sachs and his union buddies at General Motors under a \"too big to fail\" policy yet they blatantly threaten to bankrupt coal companies.\n\nHe picked his winners and losers.\n\nThe free market was no longer free.\n\nThen he got to work on health care.\n\nPresident Obama -- in an 11th hour backroom deal -- strong-armed enough votes to get ObamaCare passed into law.\n\nHe had to do it when he did it because within months, he would lose the Democratic majorities he needed to pull off his political coup. And so health care in America was forever changed..\n\nNext up.. President Obama took the laws of immigration and shredded them to suit his liberal friends.\n\nForget what we the people have to say. It really doesn't seem to matter anymore..\n\nThen came the one bastian of free speech, and the free flow of information.. the Internet.\n\nNet neutrality is giving big government big control over our Internet..\n\nOne FCC commissioner said this of net neutrality:\n\nIt's a \"solution that won't work, to a problem that doesn't exist.\"\n\nThat's from inside the FCC.\n\nAnd now, there's an idea being floated by the president this week.\n\nOne that I think could be the most dangerous of all.\n\nThe administration wants to ban sales of certain types of ammunition. And once again the White House wants to do it in a way that bypasses Congress.\n\nRemember, to ban the ammo is a sneaky way to ban the gun.\n\nFolks, the most important rights our founders outlined in the constitution were freedom of speech and freedom of religion.\n\nThese are our First Amendment rights.\n\nBut in order to protect the First Amendment -- the founders were smart -- they gave us the Second Amendment.\n\nThe right to freely bear arms.\n\nWe have the Second Amendment to insure the first.\n\nIf the president is able to take over our Second Amendment -- the way he took over the free market, health care, immigration and the Internet, we will be administering the last rights to our first rights: free speech, religion and liberty.\n\nThe fabric of America is being shredded.\n\nBut it has to stop at the Second Amendment.\n\nIt's up to us to demand that they keep their hands off our guns..\n\nOr.. we risk it all..\n\nChew on that over the weekend.\n\nEric Bolling currently serves as co-host of Fox News Channel's \"The Five\" (weekdays 5-6PM/ET).
