Maria Sachs.\n\nHoffman has conservative bona fides. She supported Herman Cain, the former Godfather\u2019s pizza chief executive (famous for his 9-9-9 tax plan) for the 2012 Republican presidential nomination.\n\nShe has also carved an independent path that has often had her voicing skepticism of establishment Republican figures than Democrats.\n\nIn March, for example, she said former Gov. Jeb Bush, Florida\u2019s favorite son and potential candidate for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination would be hurt by his support for the Common Core education standards. Hoffman said Bush \"wasn't palatable\" before Common Core. \"When he made that his core issue, then in essence he became enemy No. 1 to the grassroots.\"\n\nShe has also said that Gov.

Among his alleged sins: reversing his position on part of Obamacare and deciding to support an expansion of the Medicaid health program for the poor. (Scott couldn\u2019t convince the Republican-controlled Legislature to go along.)\n\nAnd she\u2019s worked with Democrats.\n\nIn 2011, she pulled together a group of Republicans and Democrats to discuss \u201cThe American Experiment: Where Do We Go From Here,\" an examination of the different philosophical approaches to the nation\u2019s most pressing problems: health care, energy, jobs, taxes.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "news", "og": {"site_name": "tribunedigital-sunsentinel", "description": "Karin Hoffman of Lighthouse Point, founder of the tea party group DC Works For US, is running for the Florida Senate.
