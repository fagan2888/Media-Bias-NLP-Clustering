Without it, the U.S. will indeed become a failed state.\n\nSuch reform should not be difficult. At the U.S. state level there have been 230 constitutional conventions since the founding of the country, according to Sanford Levinson, a law professor at the University of Texas and author of Our Undemocratic Constitution. The State of New York is currently on its fifth constitution. If the 50 states can do it, why not the nation as a whole?\n\nOther countries, too, have a record of frequently changing or adopting new versions of their constitutions. In contrast, the constitution of the United States of 1787 seems to enjoy a sacredness only matched by some religious books.\n\nThe last change to the U.S. Constitution, the 27th Amendment, was approved in 1992. Hard though it may be to believe, it dealt with the oh-so critical issue of increases in salary for members of the U.S. Congress not taking effect until the term following the increase.\n\nHow much more myopic can one get? Maybe the country should have saved its action-oriented powder for something more earthshaking.\n\nThe Constitution: dead or alive?\n\nNobody seems to remember that the U.S. Constitution was a highly controversial document as it was being drafted. The so-called Federalist Papers are living proof. And that was at a time when there were only 13 states in the union.\n\nThe fact that the U.S. Constitution has only been changed 27 times since 1787, which was almost 100 years before Thomas Edison turned on the lights, shows how stale and out-of-date a reference point it has become.\n\nIn other words, the rest of the living world has changed significantly. But, as Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia has been quoted as saying approvingly, the U.S. Constitution is \u201cnot a living document. It\u2019s dead, dead, dead.\u201d\n\nOf course, Justice Scalia is not suggesting that the meaning of the Constitution is dead, but that it should be interpreted exactly as written by the Founding Fathers. He views them as omniscient, even though they had not seen a light bulb, a car, a plane, a space ship, a computer, a 3D printer or a female Supreme Court Justice, for that matter.\n\nScalia\u2019s view of the Constitution, also dubbed strict constructionism suits his political purposes as a paleo-conservative. Consequently, he has no qualms with expanding the \u201cright to bear arms\u201d to semi-automatic weapons rather than limiting it to muskets existing at the times of the Founding Fathers.\n\nAnd, naturally, Justice Scalia had no patience to read the entire Second Amendment which states: \u201cA well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.\u201d Well, guess what? Just like we have don\u2019t have slavery anymore, we also don\u2019t have state militias.\n\nUrgent need for constitutional reform\n\nAll this goes to say is: The United States urgently needs constitutional reform. What key changes would need to be made?\n\nStarting with Scalia and his colleagues, the terms of justices to the Supreme Court should be limited to one term of about 10 years, enough to establish a record, without allowing individuals to create a \u201clegacy\u201d all the way to the graveyard. Of course, the nine Justices\u2019 terms would be staggered so that no President would appoint more than two.\n\nAll elections in the country would be publicly funded to make sure the country is a true democracy and not a place where the legislative body is described as \u201cthe best Congress money can buy.\u201d Thus, all direct or indirect campaign contributions would be explicitly prohibited.\n\nMoney, after all, is not free speech. It\u2019s creating an acidic stench over the entire American body politic.\n\nThe non-democratic Electoral College would be eliminated, since it can lead \u2013 and has led \u2013 to the election of four Presidents without support from the majority of the American people (the last one, President George W. Bush in his first term).", "article_metadata": {"description": "A modest proposal for a budget system that works -- and a more perfectly representative union", "title": "Constitutional reform can save us yet", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "A modest proposal for a budget system that works -- and a more perfectly representative union", "title": "Constitutional reform can save us yet", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2013/10/12/the_us_needs_constitutional_reform_or_it_will_become_a_failed_state_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/02/shutterstock_103142567-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A modest proposal for a budget system that works -- and a more perfectly representative union", "title": "Constitutional reform can save us yet", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/02/shutterstock_103142567-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Uwe Bott", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Constitutional reform, Debt ceiling, Failed state, Government shutdown, Inaction, The Globalist, us, US Constitution", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Urgent need for constitutional reformAll this goes to say is: The United States urgently needs constitutional reform.\nIn contrast, the constitution of the United States of 1787 seems to enjoy a sacredness only matched by some religious books.\nTopics: Constitutional reform, Debt ceiling, Failed state, Government shutdown, Inaction, The Globalist, us, US Constitution, Business News, News, Politics NewsThis article originally appeared on The GlobalistIf anything, the chronic re-occurrence of the U.S. government\u2019s failure to approve a budget as well as the repetitive quarrel over raising the country\u2019s debt ceiling demonstrate one thing clearly: Constitutional reform is the priority in the United States.\nThe Constitution: dead or alive?\nIt\u2019s dead, dead, dead.\u201dOf course, Justice Scalia is not suggesting that the meaning of the Constitution is dead, but that it should be interpreted exactly as written by the Founding Fathers."}
