She knows what it\u2019s all about.\n\n\u201cBe ready to eat, drink and sleep your business if you want to be a business owner,\u201d Henderson said.\n\nHenderson owns Alterations by the Clothing Surgeon, a Lisbon business that has been going strong for 25 years. She said it\u2019s all about the customers.\n\n\u201cWord of mouth is the best advertisement there is. So if you please a customer, then they are going to send you more customers,\u201d Henderson said.\n\nBut it is also important to get to know other business owners, which was one big goal of Tuesday\u2019s Business Expo.\n\n\u201cIt helps because they have the same challenges and they can help solve your problems or give any kind of advice at all,\u201d Henderson said.\n\nAudrey Null helped organize the Expo. She said that kind of networking is exactly what the event is all about.\n\n\u201cSometimes small business owners are so involved in their business that this gives them the opportunity to get out and meet some people and get some new business,\u201d Hull said.\n\nAll told, 65 businesses took part in the expo. There were also workshops led by local businesses on things like social media, innovation, cyber liability and the Affordable Care Act.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Sixty-five businesses took part in the expo.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.linmedia.newstouch.wkbn", "og": {"site_name": "WKBN.com", "description": "Sixty-five businesses took part in the expo.", "title": "Columbiana County hosts business and trade expo", "url": "http://wkbn.com/2015/07/28/columbiana-county-hosts-business-and-trade-expo/", "image": {"width": 658, "identifier": "https://lintvwkbn.files.wordpress.com/2015/07/lauren_business_expo_webstill000000.jpg", "height": 370}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "WKBN.com", "description": "Youngstown, OH, Warren, OH and Sharon, PA local news, investigative news, weather and sports.", "title": "WKBN Youngstown news, weather, sports", "url": "http://wkbn.com/", "image": "https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/530521166868267008/--gcwa1L_400x400.png", "creator": "@WKBN", "site": "wkbn", "app": {"country": "US", "name": {"iphone": "WKBN 27 FIrst News - Youngstown", "googleplay": "WKBN 27 First News"}, "id": {"iphone": 412441075}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "keywords": "buisiness expo, columbiana-county, lisbon, trade expo,home, Local News, News,Lauren Wood", "msapplication-tooltip": "Youngstown, OH, Warren, OH and Sharon, PA local news, investigative news, weather and sports.", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://wkbn.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/6b669850d8c37f8641ad8027e102d151?s=16", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=412441075", "fb": {"app_id": 121775821624, "pages": 101928538694}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "application-name": "WKBN.com", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/WKBN27", "published_time": "2015-07-28T23:12:41+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-07-28T23:31:29+00:00"}, "msvalidate.01": "482CE246B7060643327A0CDA3172B0E6", "google-site-verification": "LIwiJCyVg438RCDLx8Ytjk46NiwGsiadcaYSFBt4m3k", "yandex-verification": "49a086961d263e91"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd022\"", "article_summary": "But it is also important to get to know other business owners, which was one big goal of Tuesday\u2019s Business Expo.\n\u201cBe ready to eat, drink and sleep your business if you want to be a business owner,\u201d Henderson said.\nLISBON, Ohio (WKBN) \u2013 Small businesses got a leg up in Columbiana County on Tuesday with the county\u2019s first ever Business and Trade Expo.\n\u201cSometimes small business owners are so involved in their business that this gives them the opportunity to get out and meet some people and get some new business,\u201d Hull said.\nSusan Henderson has been a small business owner for most of her life."}
