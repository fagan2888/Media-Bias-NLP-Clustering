Bush in what I thought was (in Noonan\u2019s case) a grossly unfair manner in 2008. I wrote critically about one of Noonan\u2019s weekly Wall Street Journal columns in which she identified with the public disapproval of Bush that April in \u201cSeason of the witch.\u201d\n\nHaving turned on George W. Bush, Noonan moved on to support the election of Barack Obama later that year. Noonan all but endorsed Obama in her 2008 column \u201cObama and the runaway train.\u201d The anti-Bush and pro-Obama columns fit neatly together. She wrote of Obama just before the election:\n\nHe has within him the possibility to change the direction and tone of American foreign policy, which need changing; his rise will serve as a practical rebuke to the past five years, which need rebuking; his victory would provide a fresh start in a nation in which a fresh start would come as a national relief. He climbed steep stairs, born off the continent with no father to guide, a dreamy, abandoning mother, mixed race, no connections. He rose with guts and gifts. He is steady, calm, and, in terms of the execution of his political ascent, still the primary and almost only area in which his executive abilities can be discerned, he shows good judgment in terms of whom to hire and consult, what steps to take and moves to make. We witnessed from him this year something unique in American politics: He took down a political machine without raising his voice.\n\nIn a sense, Obama delivered, but in another sense Noonan got everything wrong. Obama has changed the direction and tone of American foreign policy, alright, yet the change hasn\u2019t yielded the results Noonan anticipated.\n\nNoonan has now turned on Obama. She actually turned on him a while ago. In a recent column \u2014 \u201cThe unwisdom of Barack Obama,\u201d behind the Journal\u2019s subscription paywall but accessible via Google \u2014 Noonan condemned Obama on one of the grounds she had supported him in 2008: \u201cHis essential problem is that he has very poor judgment.\u201d\n\nNow you tell us.\n\nIn her defense, Noonan might plead that she acknowledged the paltry evidence in support of her 2008 claim that Obama has \u201cgood judgment.\u201d If \u201cjudgment\u201d were the issue, perhaps the excuse would mitigate the verdict that Noonan herself is guilty of incredibly poor judgment.\n\nYet the problems with Obama run much deeper than poor judgment. Noonan overlooks his sophisticated ignorance and leftist ideological rigidity. If you were following the news in 2008 and acquainting yourself with Obama\u2019s background, you had to work hard to miss the evidence. Indeed, Noonan must have worked hard to avoid mentioning any of it and to work up her lyrical tribute to Obama in her 2008 column.\n\nWe have written a lot over the years about Obama\u2019s ignorance and ideology. Bret Stephens focused on Obama\u2019s ignorance in the Wall Street Journal column \u201cWhat Obama knows\u201d (behind the Journal\u2019s subscription paywall but also accessible via Google). Noonan to the contrary notwithstanding, Stephens writes: \u201c[E]ven at an elementary level, Mr. Obama often doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s talking about. It isn\u2019t so much his analysis of global events that\u2019s wrong, though it is. The deeper problem is the foundation of knowledge on which that analysis is built.\u201d\n\nI would go further than Bret Stephens in that column (as he would as well). Something beyond ignorance explains Obama\u2019s affinity for the Muslim Brotherhood, for example, and his hostility to Israel. The ideological component of Obama\u2019s failures is probably the most important.\n\nHe advertised it in his promise of \u201cfundamental transformation\u201d of the United States. He clearly meant it. He has done his best to deliver on it. He has another two years to work on it. And on this score, he knows what he is doing and it would be a serious mistake to count him a failed president.\n\nNOTE: This is adapted from my post \u201cHigh Noonan.\u201d I am taking the liberty of reposting it as a companion to \u201cA meditation on David Brooks.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Power Line", "description": "Peggy Noonan joined the crowd that turned on George W.
