Four nights a week, we tuned in to The Daily Show to process the previous day's events, watch Jon Stewart banter with authors and actors, and — if we were really lucky — see him rip into Fox News like a rabid terrier. (We'll miss you most of all, clip-montages-of-contradictions-while-Stewart-offered-scolding-commentary.) But there were a handful of times over his 16 years behind the desk when the host did more than just crack us up or remind us that "Santorum" has slowly transformed into a slang term for something unspeakable. (Google it, but don't say we didn't warn you.)

These were the moments when he'd press a guest to explain why something had fallen short of expectations, or called folks out when he felt that citizens were being purposefully misled by misinformation, or dug into a story with a depth and sense of outraged humanity that the usual news sources hadn't been able to tap. Stewart constantly told people that he was not a journalist, he was a comedian — yet there were times when he not only displayed impressive reporting/interviewing chops or got to the heart of a tragedy like 9/11 or Charleston that you felt he'd beaten the Fourth Estate at its own game. Here are 10 examples of when Stewart outdid journalism — those incredible instances when he turned The Daily Show into something much more than a late-night comedy staple.
