The ultimate aim is to supply patients who register under a 'compassionate access scheme' which is still being developed.\n\nI honestly think that medicinal cannabis would not be where it is today without Lucy's intervention together with Dan's. NSW Premier Mike Baird\n\nSuch a scheme would ensure that medicinal cannabis would not only be accessible to all those who require it, but would be priced appropriately.\n\n\"The long-term goal is for medicinal cannabis to be legalised, but further to that we need to make sure that when it's legalised it's affordable,\" Ms Haslam said.\n\nMs Haslam and her husband Lou, a former drug squad officer, have put their cafe and gift shop business on the market to help fund the project in Tamworth.\n\nThe Haslams' plan is also supported by Daniel's widow Alyce.\n\n\"I think Dan would possibly be a little bit surprised knowing that his mother is planning on setting up a cannabis centre in Tamworth, but I mean this whole journey has been full of surprises,\" she said.\n\nHaslams the 'driving force' behind medicinal cannabis change\n\nMs Haslam is widely credited as the driving force behind various state and federal initiatives aimed at legalising the drug.\n\nShe and Daniel, who was diagnosed with bowel cancer at age 20, started campaigning for legalisation when forced to access cannabis from the black market.\n\nNSW Premier Mike Baird told Australian Story that he was persuaded to act on the issue after meeting last year with the Haslams.\n\n\"It was very clear listening to the story that I wanted to do something,\" he said.\n\n\"I honestly think that medicinal cannabis would not be where it is today without Lucy's intervention together with Dan's.\n\n\"They have turned this debate on its head and I think the country has turned with her.\"\n\nA staunch opponent of recreational drugs, Ms Haslam admits her journey has been a strange one.\n\n\"I'm in a constant state of amazement at how weird my life has become. I would gladly give it up and have Dan back in a heartbeat but that's not the way life is. We just had to do this, we had no choice,\" she said.\n\nMedicinal Cannabis legislation efforts:\n\nFederal initiatives\n\nThe Federal Government has announced that it will seek parliamentary support before year's end to allow the controlled cultivation of cannabis for medicinal or scientific purposes. Patients may be able to access regulated medicinal cannabis as early as 2017.\n\nhas announced that it will seek parliamentary support before year's end to allow the controlled cultivation of cannabis for medicinal or scientific purposes. Patients may be able to access regulated medicinal cannabis as early as 2017. The Regulator of Medicinal Cannabis Bill 2014, a private member's bill which had cross-party support, was to have been tabled in parliament in November by the Greens. It would have established a regulator independent from the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) which would have overseen a scheme to make medicinal cannabis available to patients who qualify for treatment.\n\nState initiatives\n\nThe NSW Government has announced a series of clinical trials to commence in 2016. They include trials for children with severe, drug-resistant epilepsy; adults with terminal illness, focusing on improving quality of life and symptoms such as pain, nausea and vomiting; and adults with chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting, where standard treatment is ineffective.\n\nhas announced a series of clinical trials to commence in 2016.
