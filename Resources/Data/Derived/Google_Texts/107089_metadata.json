It will be worse with government-controlled health care,\u201d he told WND today.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re taking medical decisions out of the family\u2019s hands and putting it into the hands of bean counters.\u201d\n\nThat such government intervention in life will happen already has been confirmed by physician and former Democratic National Committee Chairman Howard Dean, who admitted Sarah Palin was right \u2013 because health care will have to be rationed under Obamcare, \u201cdeath panels\u201d will have to decide who gets critical care and potentially life-saving treatments.\n\nSchindler said his organization is set up to fight for the handicapped or otherwise helpless when facing a life-endangering situation, and that\u2019s how he got involved in the fight for the life of Jahi McMath.\n\nShe was undergoing a tonsillectomy at a California hospital when things went horribly wrong. Doctors soon declared her brain-dead and, but for the fight by her parents, already would have shut off a ventilator to which she is attached.\n\nNow the hospital, Children\u2019s Hospital Oakland, says it will not allow doctors to perform procedures involving breathing and feeding tubes that would allow the 13-year-old to be moved safely to another hospital.\n\nChris Dolan, a lawyer for McMath and her family, said in a statement posted online at the Terri Schiavo Life & Hope Network that he continues to request permission for the needed tracheostomy procedure so that she could be moved.\n\n\u201cAmazing research opportunities exist but Children\u2019s Hospital Oakland holds the key to Jahi\u2019s death sentence \u2013 a simple tracheostomy procedure, despite a mother\u2019s plea and the money to pay for it. Instead they starve her,\u201d he said. \u201cOur please is for a courageous ENT specialist physician to step forth and give this mother the choice and this child a chance.\u201d\n\nSchindler told WND his organization comes in where the need is for a long-term care facility or alternative to hospital intensive care unit occupancy.\n\n\u201cWe provide the resources to fight against what\u2019s there,\u201d he said.\n\nAnother hospital was on stand-by, he said, ready to accept Jahi McMath and provide treatment.\n\n\u201cWe have a facility that would take her,\u201d he confirmed. \u201cBut Childrens Hospital from Oakland is preventing that from happening.\u201d\n\nAny decision to terminate a life should not be made quickly, he said, and given time there are many things that could happen for Jahi.\n\nHis group has for its mission the development of a national network of resources and support for the \u201cmedically dependent, persons with disabilities and the incapacitated who are in or potentially facing life-threatening situations.\u201d\n\nIt originally was set up to benefit Terry Schindler Schiavo, who died in 2005 after being deprived of food and water on the orders of Circuit Court Judge George W. Greer of Florida\u2019s Sixth Judicial Court.\n\nShe was 41.\n\nShe had been stricken in 1990, at the age of 26, with a mysterious cardio-respiratory arrest for which no cause has ever been determined.\n\nShe was diagnosed with hypoxic encephalopathy \u2013 which is a neurological injury caused by lack of oxygen to the brain. She was able to breathe on her own and maintain vital function. She remained in a severely compromised neurological state.\n\nOfficials at the Oakland hospital have said they are not willing to let an outside doctor work in their facility, and their own doctors are forbidden from helping since hospital officials consider the teenager a corpse.\n\nHospital attorney Douglas Straus said, \u201cPerforming medical procedures on the body of a deceased human being is simply not something Children\u2019s Hospital can do or ask its staff to assist in doing.\u201d\n\nAccording to reports, he earlier had said the hospital would allow a doctor found by the family to insert a feeding tube and replace the ventilator keeping Jahi\u2019s heart beating.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re speaking out of both sides of their mouths. They say one thing and we go down that road, and then they say something else,\u201d Dolan said of hospital officials. \u201cThe hospital said, \u2018Bring us a doctor\u2019 and we said, \u2018Tell us the conditions\u2019 and now, they\u2019ve wasted a half a day of our time. We don\u2019t have much time.\u201d\n\nThe hospital has said it would release the girl with written permission from the coroner.\n\nThe girl had a tonsillectomy and other related procedures early last month to treat sleep apnea.\n\nAccording to her family, she went into cardiac arrest after she started bleeding in the recovery room.\n\nHospital officials three days later declared her brain-dead.\n\nHowever, the chief of a foundation that is responsible for the International Standard Version of the Holy Bible, a trained theologian, says the family of Jahi McMath has a legitimate argument against the hospital\u2019s contention that she is \u201cbrain-dead\u201d and her medical treatments should be halted.\n\nShe\u2019s not dead.\n\nAt least, not according to the Bible\u2019s definition, said Dr. William Welty, a Ph.D. who graduated from Trinity Evangelical Divinity School and later taught New Testament Greek at Simon Greenleaf University.\n\nWelty told Dolan, an attorney representing the family of Jahi McMath, that he could be an expert witness on death according to the Bible, in an email that was made available to WND.\n\n\u201cI have followed the Jahi McMath medical debacle for a number of days now. I am a professional theologian in the evangelical tradition of which Ms. McMath\u2019s mother Nailah Winkfield appears to be part,\u201d he wrote.\n\n\u201cAs I am an expert in biblical theology, including Greek and Hebrew, with respect to the question of what evangelical Christians believe about death, I might be able to be of assistance in the way of providing expert testimony about what the conservative biblical tradition to which Ms. McMath\u2019s mother belongs actually teaches, which is that death is defined not as absence of brain waves but rather the lack of a circulating blood supply,\u201d he wrote.\n\n\u201cAs the Bible states that the life of the flesh is in the blood (citing Leviticus in the Hebrew Scriptures) and not in brain wave activity, perhaps a compromise stipulation could be presented to ask the court to order that if Ms. McMath is disconnected from life support, if her heart continues to beat on its own that she should be maintained by fluid nutrition at the hospital\u2019s expense, given that the hospital\u2019s negligence is the proximate cause of this difficulty.\u201d\n\nWelty told WND that the Bible doesn\u2019t define death as a cessation, reduction or absence of brain activity.\n\nIt defines life as being in the blood, and \u201cas a closely held religious belief,\u201d the family of the 13-year-old has a right to practice their faith.\n\nHe said while science contends that it understands death, and life, and the narrow divide, he pointed out a recent report that indicates that may not be so clear.\n\nAccording to a Scripps Howard News Service report only days ago, \u201cthere\u2019s growing evidence that revival is possible for at least some patients whose hearts and lungs have stopped working for many minutes, even hours. And brain death \u2013 when the brain irreversibly ceases function \u2013 is also proving less open and shut.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor decades, doctors have recorded cases where people immersed in very cold water have been revived after hours have gone by,\u201d the report said. \u201cMany studies have found that hypothermia protects the brain by decreasing its need for oxygen and staving off cell death. Body cooling has become common for many patients after cardiac arrest.\u201d\n\nThe report continued, \u201cDefining brain death is becoming more complex as researchers find signs of activity in both human and animal subjects whose brainwaves at first show they\u2019ve \u2018flat-lined\u2019 to the point that there is no brain function. \u2026 Scientists at the University of Montreal reported in September on the case of one Romanian patient who was in an extreme deep coma after treatment with a powerful anti-epileptic drug. Although the electroencephalogram (EEG) showed no activity in the man\u2019s cortex (the master processor of the brain), there was activity in the hippocampus, the region responsible for memory and learning.\n\n\u201cJust how conscious the brain remains after cardiac arrest in frequently debated and researched. Various studies of cardiac arrest survivors shows many experience profound mental or emotional change. About 20 percent of survivors say they heard or saw something while they were clinically dead,\u201d the report said.\n\nWelty said the simple facts are that science thought it understand death, but doesn\u2019t.\n\nHe said the one absolute regarding death is that the body tissues decay, and if that\u2019s not happening, there remain questions.\n\nAnd with those questions unanswered, he said, hospitals and others should choose the conservative path and not take positive action that would bring about death.\n\nSpecial offer:\n\nOrder your copy of \u201cTerri\u2019s Story\u201d from the people who brought it to you \u2013 WND and WND Books.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Free Press For A Free People Since 1997", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.1", "og": {"site_name": "WND", "description": "The chief of a foundation set up to help disabled people in life-threatening situations is warning Americans that the horrors his sister faced before her death a few years ago, and those burdens now being faced by the family of Jahi McMath, will just get worse.
