A United Nations-backed plan to bring the two sides together to form a coalition was rejected by Libyan lawmakers earlier this week.\n\nAn estimated 3,000 Islamic extremists have taken advantage of the discord, carrying out brazen attacks on the country\u2019s oil infrastructure and seizing large swaths of territory, reminiscent of the group\u2019s march across Iraq in 2014.\n\nRelated: ISIS Is Working on a Surface-to-Air Missile: Report\n\nThe possibility of opening another front against ISIS is likely to illicit groans from a war-fatigued American public and contempt for the Obama administration from the Republican-controlled Congress, which has long maintained that the president isn\u2019t doing enough to eradicate jihadist forces.\n\nA military foray of any kind into Libya could also create headaches for Democratic presidential frontrunner Hillary Clinton who was President Obama\u2019s Secretary of State when an air campaign helped topple dictator Muammar Gaddafi roughly five years ago.\n\nClinton has been challenged about her decision regarding the terror attacks in Benghazi, Libya, that killed four Americans, including the U.S. ambassador that took place just over a year after Gaddafi\u2019s death. A call for military might no doubt would raise fresh questions about Clinton\u2019s contributions to a policy that now lies in tatters, especially since she has gone out of her way to wed herself to Obama\u2019s policies.\n\nRelated: The Most Corrupt Countries in the World Include Iraq, Afghanistan\n\nAny decision holds major implications for Obama\u2019s legacy, too. He campaigned on ending America\u2019s wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, but with less than a year left in his term there are 3,700 U.S. troops on the ground in Iraq and roughly 10,000 in Afghanistan who likely will be stationed there long after Obama has left the Oval Office. A battle against ISIS in another country would seriously damage Obama\u2019s unstated goal of being remembered as a peacemaker-in-chief.\n\nCook\u2019s remarks add to a steady drumbeat of Pentagon officials who have said that action is not only likely, but possibly imminent. Last week Joint Chiefs of Staff chair Gen. Joseph Dunford told reporters traveling with him in Europe that the president could make a decision about Libya in \u201cweeks,\u201d according to The New York Times.\n\nIn separate comments, Defense Secretary Ash Carter and Special Operations Command chief Gen. Joseph Votel also expressed deep concerns about Libya. \u201cLibya will continue to be a challenge in the year to come, illustrating the new reality where small organizations wield undeserved power,\u201d Carter said during a speech in France.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The Defense Department\u2019s top spokesman says the Pentagon is looking at taking military action in Libya to counter the growing influence of ISIS, ramping up speculation that the administration could soon open up a third front against the terror group.", "title": "Get Ready for a Third US Front Against ISIS\u2014This Time in Libya", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/01/28/Get-Ready-Third-US-Front-Against-ISIS-Time-Libya", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/wpid-2014-03-17T164056Z_1_CBREA2G1ACJ00_RTROPTP_2_LIBYA.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/01/28/Get-Ready-Third-US-Front-Against-ISIS-Time-Libya", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/wpid-2014-03-17T164056Z_1_CBREA2G1ACJ00_RTROPTP_2_LIBYA.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "The Defense Department\u2019s top spokesman says the Pentagon is looking at taking military action in Libya to counter the growing influence of ISIS, ramping up speculation that the administration could soon open up a third front against the terror group.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "In separate comments, Defense Secretary Ash Carter and Special Operations Command chief Gen.
