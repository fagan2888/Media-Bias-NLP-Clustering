The food additive, popularly used in Chinese food, and found in canned vegetables and processed meats, has been given an undeserved reputation for causing \u201cChinese Food Syndrome\u201d: headaches, nausea, and heart palpitations, among other symptoms. While consumers and companies alike have decided to go MSG-free, scientists at the American Chemical Society\u2019s Reactions (ACS) YouTube page debunk this food myth and say MSG is perfectly safe for consumption.\n\n\u201cGlutamate is found in tons of common foods that are rich in protein \u2014 meat, dairy products, and vegetables all have glutamate,\u201d say the scientists in the YouTube video, \u201cIs MSG Bad for You?\u201d The flavor enhancement we taste in MSG foods comes from the amino acid, l-glutamate. Glutamate occurs naturally within our bodies as we process and metabolize food, making it a very abundant and very common part of our diet. The monosodium part in MSG is so we can easily sprinkle it on a dish.\n\nSince the body makes this compound, it only makes sense to wonder where the 50-year-old myth originated from. According to the ACS, Robert Ho Man Kwok experienced \u201cChinese Restaurant Syndrome,\u201d a term coined in a letter to The New England Journal of Medicine. He experienced these symptoms after eating large amounts of Chinese food, which made his colleagues decide that MSG must be the culprit.\n\nFifty years later, human studies have failed to produce significant symptoms, including in those who claim to suffer. In an infographic by Compound Interest, it shows most criticisms of MSG contain anecdotal accounts, without scientific evidence to back them up. Therefore, scientists have concluded mild symptoms may occur in some individuals, but only if they consume large amounts of MSG on an empty stomach.\n\nA rule of thumb: Take MSG criticisms with a grain of salt and consume responsibly.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "msg, monosodium glutamate, chinese restaurant syndrome, chinese food", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "The American Chemical Society debunks a 50-year-old food myth and explains why MSG criticisms should be taken with a grain of salt.", "title": "Is MSG Really Bad For Your Health?
