A recent study by the Commonwealth Fund, which used new data to demonstrate that in 2012 some 31.7 million Americans were underinsured (i.e. insured, but still with heavy additional out-of-pocket health care expenses), argued that the burden of underinsurance will likely lessen as the ACA fully unfolds. But is there really reason for such optimism?\n\nThis is a complicated issue with many moving parts, so one way to tackle it (before immersing ourselves in the exhilarating policy literature) is to pose a simpler question: if your family is insured, and someone gets seriously sick, can you not worry about going broke?\n\nThe short answer: it depends on how much you have in the bank, and on the \u201cout-of-pocket maximum\u201d established by the ACA for your particular plan. The out-of-pocket maximum is the most that you would have to pay (after premiums) on things like co-pays for medications or deductibles for hospitalizations, and it can go as high as $12,700 annually for exchange plans under the ACA. But doesn\u2019t the law provide protection for lower-income individuals, for instance, in the form of reduced out-of-pocket limits? The answer is yes \u2013 but to a lesser extent than we initially thought, even though, somehow, no one informed us that things had changed.\n\nAfter it passed, my concerns about underinsurance re: the ACA revolved around codifying cost sharing measures, like large deductibles and copays, into law. But the out-of-pocket maximums that the law created were admittedly better than nothing, and \u2013 as important \u2013 were based on income. According to the text of the law, once your family income goes below 400% of the federal poverty level (which for those enrolling now would be less than $94,200 for a family of four) the maximum out-of-pocket limit (now $12,700) would be progressively reduced by either one-third, one-half, or two-thirds, giving (roughly) the following figures for 2014:\n\nIn other words, if you make less money, you have less liability for medical expenses. Putting aside the question of whether any out-of-pocket liability is a good idea (I think not), this makes sense. But, though the two-thirds/one-half/one-third limit reductions were written into law, they no longer hold.\n\nIn what seems to have gone essentially if not entirely unreported, a densely written rule issued by the Department of Health and Human Services in March 2013 eliminated the reduced out-of-pocket maximum for those making above 250% of the federal poverty level. Additionally, for those making between 200 \u2013 250% of poverty, the limit was raised from one-half to four-fifths of the $12,700 maximum (i.e. $6,350 to $10,160). These limits were then rounded up a bit more to account for \u201cany potential inaccuracies\u201d in estimates, to give us today\u2019s actual limits:\n\nTo summarize: everyone who makes between 200% and 400% of the federal poverty level (i.e. a good portion of the middle class) quietly had their Obamacare out-of-pocket liability raised substantially: for a family of four with an income of $60,000, it suddenly doubled to $12,700.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Believe me, the right's approach would be much worse.
