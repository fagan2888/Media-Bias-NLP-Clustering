Locally, the Northern New Jersey Affiliate of the Pancreatic Cancer Action Network will host residents, survivors and volunteers at Camp Harmony.\n\nPurpleLight is an awareness event that offers an opportunity for survivors, family and friends to come together to remember those who have fought pancreatic cancer, honor pancreatic cancer survivors and inspire those who have been touched by the disease.\n\n\"We are helping turn the country purple and shine light on the fourth leading cause of cancer death in the United States through PurpleLight,\" said PurpleLight Chair Stephanie Blash of the Northern New Jersey Affiliate of the Pancreatic Cancer Action Network chapter. \"Tens of thousands of people have been affected by this devastating disease. Our community joins together to honor and show appreciation of those who have fought and continue to fight in the battle against pancreatic cancer.\"\n\nPlanned by local volunteers, the event begins at 7 p.m. as participants share stories about their connection and their commitment to fight pancreatic cancer. Encouragement and comfort is gained by illuminating purple glow sticks as participants hear their loved ones' names read aloud.\n\nThis year, an estimated 49,000 Americans will be diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. More than 40,500 will die from the disease. Only 7 percent of those diagnosed survive more than five years.\n\nA study by the Pancreatic Cancer Action Network, published in the journal \"Cancer Research,\" predicts that by 2020 pancreatic cancer will surpass breast and colorectal cancer to become the second leading cause of cancer-related death in the country.\n\nThe Pancreatic Cancer Action Network is the national organization that focuses on creating hope through research, patient support, fundraising, community outreach and advocacy for a cure. The organization is leading the way to increase survival for people diagnosed with the disease through the initiative \"The Vision of Progress: Double Pancreatic Cancer Survival by 2020.\"\n\nThe Northern New Jersey Affiliate of the Pancreatic Cancer Action Network will host residents, survivors and volunteers at Camp Harmony in Warren for the annual PurpleLight awareness event Sunday.
