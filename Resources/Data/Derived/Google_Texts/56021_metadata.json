It\u2019s 2015 and it shouldn\u2019t be an issue.\u201d\n\nThe senior appears to be blissfully unaware that a 36-count pack of Trojan-enz lubricated, latex condoms can be purchased at Amazon.com for just $13.97.\n\nIn Florida, the mandatory minimum wage is $8.05 per hour. Thus, a high school student who has a basic fast-food or retail sector job only needs to work one hour and 44 minutes to purchase 36 condoms.\n\nSuperintendent Owen Roberts met with Christmas. She said the superintendent\u2019s message was that he is uncertain if the free-condom proposal has broad support in the community.\n\nShe is undeterred.\n\n\u201cI would love to see more discussion in schools. It\u2019s something that\u2019s still taboo and it\u2019s not talked about at all,\u201d Christmas said, talking about sex and condoms on the WCJB television newscast reaching hundreds of thousands of people.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have a sex-ed class,\u201d the senior also claimed.\n\n\u201cAlachua County teaches abstinence-only sex education without any further instruction,\u201d Gainesville pediatrician Olivia Potter has previously written in The Gainesville Sun, according to EAGnews.org.\n\nThe next potential free condom giveaway is never far off in America\u2019s taxpayer-funded public schools.\n\nA couple years ago, for example, the Philadelphia Health Department installed clear plastic dispensers brimming with free condoms at several public high schools.

Parental notification did not appear to have been part of the ambitious plan.

The women\u2019s rights activist received 39 percent of the vote while her opponent, also a Democrat, won with 61 percent.
