Rick Scott.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nBuzzfeed reports that emails it obtained from September 23, 2013 show Duncan\u2019s request for help from Bush, the former Florida governor, and Bush\u2019s advice that followed which said Scott was \u201cfearful of rebellion.\u201d\n\nThe email from Duncan names \u201cGov Scott\u201d in the Subject field and continues in the Message field with, \u201cIs calling me. Any advice?\u201d\n\nBush, reports Buzzfeed, replied from a plane an hour later:\n\nI am on a plane. He is fearful of the rebellion. Wants to stop using the term common core but keep the standards. Wants to get out of PARCC. I asked him if he had specifics things that the federal government is doing or perceived to be doing. He didn\u2019t have them when I spoke to him last thursday evening.\n\nDuncan\u2019s response was a simple, \u201cThanks.\u201d\n\nOn the very same day of the email exchange between Duncan and Bush, Scott announced a \u201cpath forward for high education standards\u201d and a \u201cdecision to withdraw from PARCC,\u201d one of the two federally funded interstate test consortia that are creating tests aligned with the Common Core standards.\n\nIn his press release, consistent with Bush\u2019s warning to Duncan, Scott said he was outlining steps for the State Board of Education to \u201cmaintain high education standards,\u201d and \u201cremove the state from federal intrusion in education policy.\u201d\n\nIn early 2014, Florida \u201crebranded\u201d the Common Core standards with the local flavor title of \u201cNext Generation Sunshine State Standards.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Ed.
