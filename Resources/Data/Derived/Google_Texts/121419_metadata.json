Navigator Danny Shaver will work 24 hours a week for the health department to assist eligible residents in completing the paperwork.\n\n\u201cWe have the highest percentage of uninsured in this region,\u201d Coulter said. \u201cWe also have high rates of smoking, obesity, diabetes and dental problems, as well as a lack of access to medical care.\u201d\n\nHIP 2.0, the state\u2019s health insurance plan for low-income residents who don\u2019t qualify for Medicaid, is improving medical care in the state, Coulter said.\n\nThe county health clinic continues to see 20 to 30 newly insured patients each week, but there are thousands without health insurance, Coulter said.\n\nThe expansion of health care coverage for low-income residents has allowed the Wayne County Health Clinic to add a full-time pediatric nurse practitioner to its staff, Coulter said.\n\nNurse practitioner Melinda Fox began as a part-time employee and in November became a full-time employee, Coulter said.\n\nMelinda Fox (Photo: Supplied)\n\nThe barriers to enrolling in the state\u2019s health insurance programs are as varied as the patients, Coulter said.\n\n\u201cSome people think it\u2019s too good to be true,\u201d Coulter said of HIP 2.0. \u201cSome think it\u2019s a handout. Having insurance coverage gives us the opportunity to help people with their health problems while they are still treatable.\u201d\n\nSharrie Harlin, a Reid Health navigator, knows too well how challenging it is to enroll low-income residents in state health programs.\n\nSharrie Harlin (Photo: Supplied)\n\nHolding public meetings to explain options and enroll residents wasn\u2019t very successful, Harlin said.\n\n\u201cWe have more success when we go to them,\u201d Harlin said. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing more people since we have moved downtown. We\u2019re most effective when we see people face-to-face. I go to the free laundry days. It\u2019s been most effective to follow the Gleaner\u2019s truck,\u201d Harlin said.\n\nGleaners of Indianapolis periodically gives food away in Wayne, Fayette and Union counties through its mobile pantries, often drawing hundreds of potential health insurance clients.\n\n\u201cNot everybody there is eligible for insurance coverage, but I\u2019ve signed up 400 to 500 people at those events,\u201d Harlin said. \u201cFace-to-face is the most effective way to get people signed up. They tell their friends, and those friends tell their friends. \u2018I met Sharrie at the laundromat\u2019 is what they tell their friends.\u201d\n\nHarlin also has spent time at the North Seventh Street parking lot\u2019s farmers\u2019 markets, at the food pantry at Northside Church of Christ and with Nettle Creek bus drivers.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m wherever two or three are gathered,\u201d Harlin said with a laugh.\n\nNavigators met earlier this month at the Excel Center to discuss ways to work together in 2016. Navigators will work more in the rural areas of Wayne, Union and Fayette counties next year to try to reach those uninsured residents.\n\nStarting a HIP 2.0 application is easy, but following through with all the steps is the challenge, Harlin said.\n\n\u201cThey have to have a birth certificate, a photo ID and 30 days\u2019 proof of income. You have to go to Work One and get a printout. Some I\u2019ve talked to six or seven times,\u201d Harlin said.\u201d \u201cIt takes about four to six weeks to be approved if you have all the paperwork.\u201d\n\nHIP 2.0 covers Hoosiers ages 19 to 64 who meet income levels. A single individual can earn up to $16,436 a year, couples up to $22,246 and a family of four not more than $33,865 a year to be eligible for the program.\n\nHIP Link is a new program that helps low-income workers participate in their company\u2019s employer-sponsored health insurance program, with the state reimbursing the employee for most of their required contribution to their company\u2019s insurance plan.\n\nThe deadline to enroll in the Affordable Care Act insurance program also is approaching, Harlin said. Jan. 15 is the last day to enroll or change plans for coverage to start Feb. 1.\n\nOpen enrollment for the Affordable Care Act ends on Jan. 31, with any changes made between Jan. 16-31 effective on March 1.\n\nIndiana has 12 authorized insurance companies for the Affordable Care Act coverage, but only three serve this area and only one \u2014 United Health Care \u2014 is accepted at Reid Health, Harlin said.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://pinews.co/1YNAGJ2", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Danny Shaver will work 24 hours a week to help area residents with the paperwork needed to get insurance coverage.", "og": {"site_name": "Pal-Item", "description": "Danny Shaver will work 24 hours a week to help area residents with the paperwork needed to get insurance coverage.", "title": "Wayne Co.
