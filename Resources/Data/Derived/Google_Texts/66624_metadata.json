The Obama administration says that we have Obamacare to thank for this \u201cpositive transformative change.\u201d\n\nBut the only thing that\u2019s \u201cchanged\u201d is how hospitals fill out the government\u2019s forms. Many are choosing to record hospital stays under Medicare, the federal government\u2019s health care program for seniors, as outpatient \u201cmedical observation\u201d rather than formal readmission. That classification can present patients with huge bills and limited options for follow-up care.\n\nSo hospitals are, indeed, meeting Obamacare\u2019s statistical goals \u2013 at the expense of patients.\n\nObamacare\u2019s architects wanted to reduce the number of times a patient returned to a hospital. Fewer readmissions, they reasoned, meant a hospital was doing a better job.\n\nTo achieve that goal, they created a penalty. If a hospital had an \u201cexcessive\u201d number of readmissions within 30 days of an inpatient stay, Obamacare would reduce its Medicare payments by 3 percent.\n\nLast year, the law cut payments to 2,592 hospitals \u2013 almost half of all hospitals \u2013 for a combined loss of $420 million. According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, all but 209 of these hospitals faced the penalty last year. Even if a hospital reduces readmissions over the previous year, it can still be subject to the fine.\n\nIt\u2019s no wonder that hospitals have sought to avoid the penalty. During 2012-13, hospitals reported 150,000 fewer readmissions among Medicare patients.\n\nTo drive down readmission rates, hospitals simply manipulated the data. Patients returning with complications were no longer formally readmitted and given inpatient status. Instead, hospitals entered them as under outpatient \u201cobservation status.\u201d\n\nIndeed, as an August Health Affairs report noted, the readmission penalty \u201cpressures hospitals to cheat.\u201d\n\nOf the 3,500 general hospitals subject to Obamacare\u2019s penalty, readmission rates dropped by 9 percent from 2010 to 2013. But observation rates soared 48 percent. That uptick accounted for about 40 percent of the reduction in readmissions.\n\nProblem solved, penalty avoided \u2013 all at the stroke of a computer key.\n\nUnfortunately, patients under \u201cobservation\u201d don\u2019t qualify for Medicare\u2019s benefits. For the program to pay for a subsequent nursing-home stay, a beneficiary must spend at least three nights in a hospital as an inpatient.\n\nA patient under observation doesn\u2019t meet that standard. So even if he or she spends days in a hospital bed, the federal government will refuse to cover the cost of his or her rehabilitative treatment or medication afterward.\n\nThat can leave seniors responsible for thousands of dollars in medical bills.\n\nConsider the case of Bob Wellentin, a retired teacher from Washington State. After his wife spent four days in a hospital in 2014, she went to a nursing home. But since she had been classified as \u201cunder observation\u201d \u2013 not as a readmission \u2013 Medicare wouldn\u2019t pay for her nursing-home stay. She was handed a bill for $20,000. To pay it, she and her husband had to liquidate a life-insurance policy.\n\nIn a Boston hospital, Harold Engler endured a 10-day outpatient \u201cmedical observation\u201d stay because of complications from hernia surgery. He ended up with $7,859 in nursing-home rehabilitation costs.\n\nOnce patients have been deemed under observation, it\u2019s difficult to get the classification reversed. They often must pay out of pocket for their care and then seek reimbursement. That\u2019s difficult for the many Americans who don\u2019t have thousands of dollars lying around. And they must wage a two-front legal battle against both the federal government and medical bureaucracies. That fight can stretch on for years.\n\nKeeping seniors from having to be readmitted to the hospital is a worthy goal. Unfortunately, Obamacare has blessed fraud as an acceptable means of meeting that goal. Seniors are paying the price.\n\nSally C. Pipes is president, CEO and Thomas W.
