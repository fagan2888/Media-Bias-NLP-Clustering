Advisors at the Morton Comprehensive Health Center say a lot has changed in the marketplace this year, so they recommend talking to someone before signing up for health insurance.

“That's the reason why I'm here today; I'm hoping to get some clarification and that way, to make it easier so I know what to expect through the marketplace," said Joy White.

White is signing up for health insurance through the marketplace for the first time. Her Husband recently got laid off and she's searching for answers when it comes to the new coverage.

"You try to go online to do comparisons but it's daunting," she said.

So she decided to get help from Affordable Care Navigators at the Morton Clinic.

Nancy Rardin is health resources advocate at the clinic and say's this year it’s important to get educated.

In the past, the marketplace had more providers. This year, in Oklahoma, Rardin say's there are only two: Blue Cross Blue Shield and United Health Care. So, if your previous plan was under a different provider you need to re-enroll.

"I had a call last night from someone that [asked], ‘you know what's the difference between community care from last year to this year?’ Well, community care isn't even a provider this year, so if you haven't heard that or don't know that, you're not going to be insured in 2016," Rardin stated.

Rardin say's another one of the big concerns she hears is affordability.

"I've had a lot of people say, ‘They say this is affordable, this isn't affordable!’ Well, if you just get someone to help you sift through it all, and maybe you're missing something, that would make it much more affordable and that's what we're here for."

And White says she's thankful there's some guidance available, especially through a subject that can be so overwhelming.

The deadline to get coverage by January 1st is Tuesday, and the final deadline is January 31st to get insurance by March 1st.
