According to an estranged son, Fred Phelps, the octogenarian founder of the Westboro Bapitst Church (WBC) hate-group/cult, is “on the edge of death.”

Writing on his Facebook, Phelps’ son, Nate, who decades ago left the church and the family with it, claimed the controversial religious leader was barely holding on to life.

“I’ve learned that my father, Fred Phelps, Sr., pastor of the ‘God Hates Fags’ Westboro Baptist Church … is now on the edge of death at Midland Hospice house in Topeka, Kansas,” wrote Phelps.

“I feel sad for all the hurt he’s caused so many,” Phelps continued. “I feel sad for those who will lose the grandfather and father they loved. And I’m bitterly angry that my family is blocking the family members who left from seeing him, and saying their good-byes.”
