It also caters to hospitals, universities and businesses \u2014 from the John Marshall Law School to Macaroni Grill.\n\nAerohive\u2019s control plane operates between wireless access points, rather than hardware controllers, software controllers or other products. The access points automatically configure once connected to the desired network, and troubleshooting can be done remotely via the cloud.\n\nThe benefits of cloud networking include the ability for companies to increase capacity without having to make capital investments in additional servers, storage or networking infrastructure, says Joel Vincent, director of product marketing for Aerohive, who works closely with Aerohive\u2019s long-term care customer base.\n\nIn addition, this type of network makes upgrading technology easier for the majority of providers who have a limited IT team, he says.\n\nBefore making the switch, many providers have concerns about streamlining data across multiple sites, being HIPAA compliant and ensuring that residents and guests can access the Internet without compromising the security of sensitive records.\n\n\u201cThe concerns are twofold: How do you [give residents Internet access and securely streamline medical data] and keep that great wall between you?\u201d he says.\n\nAccess Health Records from Multiple Sites\n\nAerohive\u2019s controller-less wireless architecture helps providers achieve IT efficiencies not possible with classic network architectures, says Chris Fadrowski, senior director of IT infrastructure at Brookdale, in a case study based on the technology implementation.\n\nWhen Brookdale, with about 660 facilities across the country, began its search for a Wi-Fi network that would meet its needs, a cloud-based network was the optimal fit, he says, noting that it can be easily scaled out across multiple sites.\n\n\u201cA controller-less network saves on costs and adds resiliency and redundancy to our network,\u201d Fadrowski says. \u201cWhen we first starting looking [for a wireless network] we were seeing a lot of controller-based solutions, and one of our concerns, especially with Electronic Medical Records [EMRs] and the applications we\u2019re deploying currently, was the need for 24/7 uptime, which is much different for our industry than two years ago.\u201d\n\nOne main reason to go wireless is to be better positioned to provide a higher level of care and accuracy, and a big part of that is a need for EHRs to be portable.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re finding mobility is key for our EMR applications,\u201d Fadrowski says. \u201cIt gives us the ability to do bedside support and therapy in many locations, without having to be connected by a wire. When charting [a patient\u2019s medical information], not having to worry about handwriting and making that information available to physicians and family members in real time is very important.\u201d\n\nDaybreak Venture began working with Aerohive Networks a few years ago after identifying a need to upgrade the Texas-based provider\u2019s technology, says Daybreak Venture CIO John Valker.\n\nThe long-term and rehabilitative care, skilled nursing, hospice, respite care and long-term care provider will complete rolling out Wi-Fi to all of its communities \u2014 75 in Texas and four in Missouri \u2014 before the end of this year.\n\n\u201cIt makes it easier for staff to do their jobs,\u201d Valker says, adding it helps staff better document care in real time, versus recording the day\u2019s activities at the end of a shift.\n\nFor staff visiting residents across sites, \u201cthey don\u2019t have to go from configuration changes between visits,\u201d Valker says, noting that managed care systems limit access to only the information they need.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s much more user-friendly for them,\u201d he says.\n\nMeeting HIPAA Security Requirements\n\nAs provisions outlined in the Affordable Care Act (ACA)\u2014a.k.a \u201cObamacare\u201d\u2014take effect and reform the nation\u2019s healthcare environment, the adoption rate of EHR/EMR technology is becoming more prevalent among senior living organizations, experts say, noting that many will be forced to comply in an increasing competitive landscape emphasizing Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs).\n\nAs of June, nearly 66% of surveyed senior living organizations were investing in electronic health and medical records, according to Ziegler\u2019s 2014 Technology Spending report.\n\nFor those providers who are doing electronic charting and retrieving medical records online, data privacy and security are a big concern \u2014 especially with last year\u2019s changes to The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA).\n\n\u201cUnder the old HIPAA rule, you had to prove someone had used the lost or stolen data, now the data is presumed used and reportable unless you can prove it wasn\u2019t and proving data was not used is much harder than proving it was,\u201d Scott Ranson, Chief Information Officer for Brookdale Senior Living, told SHN earlier this year.\n\nFirewalls at all of Aerohive\u2019s access points create the security providers need to be HIPAA compliant, Vincent says, adding that firewalls allow providers to set up completely different privacy attributes to the two networks, but exist on one infrastructure.\n\nLogin information and mobile device management systems also ensure that only those who are authorized on a certain network are using it.\n\n\u201cWith mobile device management systems you can lock down a device to make sure it\u2019s very secure,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd that partners with U.S. Department of Defense level encryption, so even if the device is tampered with it can shut down and not allow access.\u201d\n\nTech Savvy Residents\n\nBeyond ensuring the security of EHRs and EMRs, rolling out Wi-Fi for everyone on site is important for resident wellness, Valker with Daybreak Venture says.\n\n\u201cWe had residents and families reach out to us and ask us for it because it enables them to connect, for example through social media like Facebook,\u201d Valker says, noting that staying up to-date with the latest technology can be challenging.\n\n\u201cThe families have different needs and wants, so there\u2019s a challenge for us to keep it current, but being able to address that in a reasonable time frame and make [Internet] available to guests is very important,\u201d he says. \u201cThe feedback from family since we\u2019ve implemented it has been huge.\u201d\n\nWritten by Cassandra Dowell", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "brookdale senior living, daybreak venture, business, finance, real estate, senior housing", "og": {"site_name": "Senior Housing News", "description": "The emerging use of Wi-Fi and Electronic Health Records (EHRs) in senior living communities has long been discussed by industry experts as key to serving today and tomorrow\u2019s residents, but a unique approach to managing data using the cloud is helping operators best meet employee Read More \u00bb", "title": "How Senior Living is Using The Cloud to Improve Care, Security -
