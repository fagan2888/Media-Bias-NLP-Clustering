Eisenhower was president way back then. Alaska and Hawaii were just entering the union in 1959 and Marilyn Monroe was sizzling in Some Like It Hot. After more than half a century of mistrust, estrangement, and turmoil, change will hardly come swiftly to the U.S.-Cuba relationship.\n\nStill, some are chomping at the bit after Obama\u2019s historic announcement. Congress still needs to approve the lifting of economic sanctions against Cuba and this is not a sure thing, especially after Raul Castro\u2019s declaration on Saturday that communism is not dead in Cuba.\n\nRelated: As Cuba Emerges, So Does a Legacy of Betrayal and Hope\n\nThe Cuban exiles, meanwhile, who have made this country their home have established deep roots - in Miami mostly, but also in Tampa Bay, northern New Jersey and parts of New York, as well as in California, Texas, North Carolina and Georgia. More than two million Cuban Americans live in the U.S. and the majority in Miami has made Little Havana a bastion of Cuban culture, rich with its food, music and family-first focus.\n\nAs the new American-Cuban reality takes shape, here\u2019s a look at some other key facts about Cuba:\n\n11 million+: The population of Cuba, which includes the island of Cuba as well as the Isle of Youth and many smaller islands.\n\n90 miles: The approximate distance from Cuba to the tip of Key West, Florida.\n\n$121 billion: Cuba\u2019s gross domestic product (2012 estimate).\n\nRelated: 20 American Cars That Rock Cuba\n\n69th: Where Cuba\u2019s economy ranks globally right now.\n\n$6,200: The average annual income in Cuba, according to the U.N.\n\n$360 million: The current annual value of U.S. exports to Cuba (as of 2013).

Cuba has offered more than 460 doctors and nurses in the battle against the virus.\n\n50,000+: The number of Cuban health care workers toiling away in more than 66 countries. \u201cCuba is world-famous for its ability to train outstanding doctors and nurses,\u201d said WHO director Margaret Chan in September.\n\n23,000+: The number of physicians from low-income communities in 83 countries (including the U.S.) that have graduated from Cuba\u2019s Latin American Medical School (ELAM).
