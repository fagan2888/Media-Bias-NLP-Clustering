Where pharmaceutical companies, hospitals, medical device providers and insurance companies wield enough political influence to torpedo any reform that doesn\u2019t offer them guaranteed increases in their bottom lines?\n\nBrill\u2019s book performs an admirable job of getting behind the scenes of the White House decision to tell us the story of the genesis and implementation of Obamacare. He combines this with more than enough of the two-a-penny accounts of victims of the US healthcare system \u2013 individuals who have been exploited in moments of need by companies whose putative raison d\u2019\u00eatre is to save and improve lives.\n\nThe vicissitudes of the US\u2019s healthcare system have been well documented before Brill.\n\nIn combination with his reporting on Obamacare\u2019s origins, passage and implementation, from Kentucky\u2019s Kynect healthcare commerce platform, to Silicon Valley-inspired insurer Oscar, Brill shares his own harrowing experiences on the gurney as he was wheeled into New York Presbyterian Hospital for an operation to correct an aortic aneurysm.\n\nBrill\u2019s account is a fair, exhaustive, state-of-the-nation account of the broken US healthcare system and Obama\u2019s partially successful attempt to heal it.\n\nq&a a high price for good health\n\nAdam Bouyamourn explains the intricacies of ObamaCare.\n\nHow does Obamacare work?\n\nUnder the Affordable Care Act, the US government requires everyone to have insurance, either through their employer or by purchasing it themselves (the individual mandate). The governme nt provides subsidies on insurance for families earning up to 400 per cent of the poverty line. Insurers can no longer bar individuals with pre-existing conditions.\n\nWhat problems remain?\n\nThe government is forbidden from negotiating with pharmaceutical companies to buy cheaper drugs. Hospitals cannot import drugs from abroad, where they would be cheaper. The pharmaceutical industry won these concessions by threatening not to support the bill. They ensure supernormal profits for drug makers. Some families will be hit by high confiscation rates at the withdrawal of subsidy \u2014 where earning an additional $50 per year can result in cuts to government support of many thousands of dollars. Hospitals still have an incentive to overprescribe health care \u2014 especially now that their customers are more likely to be able to pay their bills. The bill contains a few measures to lower costs, but not enough to slow the rapid rates of health inflation.\n\nWhat does Steven Brill want to see?\n\nHe proposes vertical integration between hospitals and insurers. He notes that this would reduce hospitals\u2019 incentives to overcharge, and inability to get away with it by exploiting the information advantage they enjoy over insurance companies.\n\nabouyamourn@thenational.ae\n\nFollow The National\u2019s Business section on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"Description": "Steven Brill's Bitter Pill: Money, Politics, Backroom Deals, and the Fight to Fix Our Broken Healthcare System, examines how the healthcare system in the US is failing.", "title": "Book review: America\u2019s Bitter Pill by Steven Brill | The National", "og": {"url": "http://www.thenational.ae/business/the-life/book-review-americas-bitter-pill-by-steven-brill", "image": "http://www.thenational.ae/storyimage/AB/20150120/ARTICLE/150129982/AR/0/AR-150129982.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Steven Brill's Bitter Pill: Money, Politics, Backroom Deals, and the Fight to Fix Our Broken Healthcare System, examines how the healthcare system in the US is failing.", "title": "Book review: America\u2019s Bitter Pill by Steven Brill | The National"}, "twitter": {"domain": "thenational.ae", "description": "Steven Brill's Bitter Pill: Money, Politics, Backroom Deals, and the Fight to Fix Our Broken Healthcare System, examines how the healthcare system in the US is failing.", "creator": "@TheNationalUAE", "image": {"src": "http://www.thenational.ae/storyimage/AB/20150120/ARTICLE/150129982/AR/0/AR-150129982.jpg"}, "title": "Book review: America\u2019s Bitter Pill by Steven Brill", "site": "@TheNationalUAE", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"page_id": 148788988477345, "pages": 148788988477345}, "Keywords": "Bitter Pill: Money, Politics, Backroom Deals, and the Fight to Fix Our Broken Healthcare System,Steven Brill,book review,ObamaCare,health care,US,insurance", "news_keywords": "Bitter Pill: Money, Politics, Backroom Deals, and the Fight to Fix Our Broken Healthcare System,Steven Brill,book review,ObamaCare,health care,US,insurance"}, "article_summary": "Steven Brill, the author of America\u2019s Bitter Pill: Money, Politics, Backroom Deals, and the Fight to Fix Our Broken Healthcare System, doesn\u2019t quite put it like that.\nWhere pharmaceutical companies, hospitals, medical device providers and insurance companies wield enough political influence to torpedo any reform that doesn\u2019t offer them guaranteed increases in their bottom lines?\nBrill\u2019s account is a fair, exhaustive, state-of-the-nation account of the broken US healthcare system and Obama\u2019s partially successful attempt to heal it.\nThe vicissitudes of the US\u2019s healthcare system have been well documented before Brill.\nThe government is forbidden from negotiating with pharmaceutical companies to buy cheaper drugs."}
