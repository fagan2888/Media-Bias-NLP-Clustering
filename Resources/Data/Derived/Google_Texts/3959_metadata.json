Cuccinelli II. Mr. Cuccinelli lost in November to the current governor, Terry McAuliffe.\n\nA lawyer for Mr. Williams, Jerry W. Kilgore, declined to comment. Mr. Williams stepped down as chief executive of Star Scientific last month and the company changed its name.\n\nIf convicted, the McDonnells could face decades in prison.\n\nAs detailed in the 43-page indictment, Mr. Williams ingratiated himself with the McDonells by giving them lavish gifts and loans, many of which it said Ms. McDonnell solicited with the promise that she and the governor could help his company.\n\nMr. Williams, an entrepreneur whose publicly traded company developed dietary supplements and cosmetics derived from a tobacco extract, sought to use the McDonnells to impress investors, as well as to enlist the governor\u2019s support in winning state-funded research on his product.\n\nIn April 2011, the government charges, Ms. McDonnell asked Mr. Williams to buy her an Oscar de la Renta gown in New York for a political event at the Union League Club. She promised to seat him next to the governor.\n\nLater that year, the indictment charges, Ms. McDonnell told Mr. Williams that she and her husband were having severe financial difficulties because of real estate investments in Virginia Beach. She asked for a $50,000 loan. Mr. Williams agreed to lend the money, telling the governor that \u201cloan paperwork was not necessary,\u201d according to the charges.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nShortly after, Mr. Williams paid $15,000 to cater the wedding of the McDonnells\u2019 middle daughter, and Ms. McDonnell agreed to fly to Florida on Mr. Williams\u2019s private jet to promote a dietary supplement called Anatabloc, made by Star Scientific.\n\n\u201cThanks so much for all your help with my family,\u201d the governor wrote to Mr. Williams, in an email included in the indictment. \u201cYour very generous gift to [CM] was most appreciated as well as the golf round tomorrow for the boys,\u201d he added, with \u201cCM\u201d apparently a reference to the governor\u2019s middle daughter.\n\n\u201cMaureen is excited about the trip to fla to learn more about the products,\u201d he added.\n\nAt the governor\u2019s request, according to the indictment, the Virginia secretary of health asked policy advisers to meet with Mr. Williams, who was interested in having Virginia\u2019s public universities conduct scientific studies of the health benefits of the active ingredient in Anatabloc, which he would be able to point to for investors.\n\nIn a meeting with the health policy adviser, Mr. Williams said he had discussed with the governor having the studies paid for by the State Tobacco Commission.\n\nLater, when the governor met with a top state official about ways to reduce health care costs, Mr. McDonnell pulled out some Anatabloc from his pocket, said he took it personally and asked the official to \u201creach out to the \u2018Anatabloc people\u2019 and meet with them,\u201d according to the indictment.\n\nIn the summer of 2011, when Mr. Williams offered a mountain lake home he owned to the McDonnells for a getaway, Ms. McDonnell asked if Mr. Williams\u2019s Ferrari would be available for their use. Mr. Williams had an employee drive the car to the lake house for the McDonnells\u2019 enjoyment, according to the indictment.\n\nThe government charges that after Ms. McDonnell met with investigators in February 2013, she wrote a note to Mr. Williams trying to cover her tracks by making it appear that she had agreed to return the designer luxury goods to him rather than keep them.\n\nThe governor was charged with routing Mr. Williams\u2019s loans and other largess through family members and \u201ccorporate entities\u201d to avoid revealing them on annual gift disclosure filings. When details of some of the gifts emerged publicly last year, Mr. McDonnell said they had been made to family members, not himself, and therefore he was not required to disclose them.\n\nSpeaking to radio listeners last spring, Mr. McDonnell said, \u201cI think it\u2019s important that the people of Virginia know that nothing has been done with regard to my relationship with Mr. Williams or his company Star Scientific to give any kind of special benefits to him or his company.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAlthough Mr. McDonnell said he had returned all the gifts, the indictment includes a list of property that he and his wife would be required to forfeit if they are convicted. The list includes Mr. McDonnell\u2019s silver Rolex, two gold Oscar de la Renta dresses, an Armani jacket and matching dresses, two pairs of Foot Joy golf shoes, a baby blue striped Peter Millar golf shirt, a Ping Kinloch golf bag, two sets of golf clubs, two iPhones and 30 boxes of Anatabloc.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20140121164938, "twitter": {"description": "Former Gov.
