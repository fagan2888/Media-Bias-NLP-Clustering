The Supreme Court last month ordered a lower appeals court to rethink a ruling against the University of Notre Dame in light of Hobby Lobby.\n\nGeneva College, a Christian institution in Beaver Falls, Penn., is seeking the same type of review after a loss before the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Philadelphia, as is Priests for Life, a pro-life ministry that lost its case before a panel of the U.S. Court of the Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit but wants a rehearing before a full slate of judges.\n\n\u201cSo far, the appeals courts have relied heavily on the Notre Dame decision. Now that it is no longer good law, we expect to see some courts forging a different path,\u201d Ms. Windham said.\n\nIf the appeals courts split over how to interpret Hobby Lobby and the nonprofits, it will be difficult for the Supreme Court to resist taking up the case.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re waiting for,\u201d said the Rev. Frank Pavone, national director of Priests for Life.\n\nAnalysts, though, questioned whether the Supreme Court will accept the religious groups\u2019 argument.\n\n\u201cI do not think that nonprofits can look to Hobby Lobby and say we should be exempt too, like for-profits, because for-profits are only temporarily exempt,\u201d said Holly Lynch, a health and ethics expert at Harvard Law School. \u201cThe question is whether the accommodation that has been offered to nonprofits, and soon to certain for-profits, can withstand an RFRA challenge.\u201d\n\nBut Ms. Windham said the high court is unlikely to water down its initial position.\n\n\u201cWe believe \u2018Hobby Lobby\u2019 sent a very strong signal to the government that it needed to do a better job protecting free exercise,\u201d she said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Corporations with religious objections have already been granted relief from Obamacare's contraceptive mandate, but religious colleges and charities are still fighting the administration in court, saying that, as of right now, they're getting even worse treatment.", "Author": "Tom Howell Jr.", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Corporations with religious objections have already been granted relief from Obamacare\u2019s contraceptive mandate, but religious colleges and charities are still fighting the administration in court, saying that, as of right now, they\u2019re getting even worse treatment.", "title": "Religious colleges seek contraception mandate exception like for-profit companies", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/apr/6/religious-colleges-seek-contraception-mandate-exce/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/04/06/pills_2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/04/06/pills_2.jpg", "title": "Religious colleges seek contraception mandate exception like for-profi", "description": "Corporations with religious objections have already been granted relief from Obamacare's contraceptive mandate, but religious colleges and charities are still fighting the administration in court, say", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "news_keywords": "Religion Belief, Law Crime, Supreme Court, Lori Windham"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0836\"", "article_summary": "The government is still trying to write new rules that meet the RFRA\u2019s test, but for now it\u2019s left for-profit corporations being treated better than religious nonprofits, the religious groups say.\nTwo Baptist colleges take their case to a federal appeals court in Houston on Tuesday, and another appeals court in Denver is expected to rule any day now on an appeal from the Little Sisters of the Poor, a Catholic order of nuns that also objects to the mandate.\n\u201cWe believe \u2018Hobby Lobby\u2019 sent a very strong signal to the government that it needed to do a better job protecting free exercise,\u201d she said.\nThe Supreme Court last month ordered a lower appeals court to rethink a ruling against the University of Notre Dame in light of Hobby Lobby.\n\u201cSo far, the appeals courts have relied heavily on the Notre Dame decision."}
