The NHS says the drugs save 7,000 lives a year.\n\nProposed changes to prescription guidelines mean they could soon be prescribed to 12million patients.\n\nBut two recent articles in the British Medical Journal have claimed statins cause harmful side effects, and do not necessarily reduce mortality.\n\nProfessor Collins, of Oxford University, said the papers by John Abramson, from Harvard Medical School, and British cardiologist Aseem Malhotra were misleading.\n\nHe added: 'Statins are given to people at elevated risk of heart attacks and strokes.\n\n'If people at elevated risk stop taking their statins \u2013 or don't start taking their statins \u2013 then they will have unnecessary heart attacks and strokes, there will be unnecessary deaths from vascular causes. This is a serious disservice to medicine.'\n\n\n\nHe said the uncertainty over statins was more serious than the MMR scare, when a researcher claimed the jabs could cause autism, leading to many parents refusing to have their children vaccinated.\n\nHe added: 'The papers are far worse in terms of the harm they have done, and [the uncertainty] is probably killing more people... than that on the MMR vaccine.'\n\nBMJ editor Dr Fiona Godlee said the articles were well referenced and peer reviewed, and insisted that significant medical issues deserved to be debated openly.\n\n(Stock picture) More than seven million Britons with high cholesterol take statins to cut the risk of heart attacks and strokes She added: 'It's important that the public understand when we're talking about extending statins to people at low risk, that the balance between benefits and harms becomes much more important.'\n\nStatins are offered to those with a 20 per cent risk of a heart attack or stroke in the next ten years.\n\nBut following a study by Professor Collins, health chiefs recommended in February that they should be given to those with a 10 per cent risk.\n\nBut critics say over-prescribing to low-risk patients could lead to muscle weakness, kidney problems, diabetes and depression.\n\nDr Abramson said his study showed statins did not cut deaths by much, adding: 'Dr Collins is fear-mongering when he says lives will be lost as a result of our calculations.'\n\nAseem Malhotra, of Croydon University Hospital in South London, said pills were a poor substitute for a good diet and more exercise.\n\nBut analysis at Imperial College London of 29 trials of statins involving more than 80,000 people said the drugs had almost no side effects.", "article_metadata": {"Rating": "General", "news_keywords": "Doctors,fears,statins,putting,lives,risk,Professor,says,unjustified,concerns,effects,mean,drugs,not,prescribed,enough", "original-source": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2587635/Doctors-fears-statins-putting-lives-risk-Professor-says-unjustified-concerns-effects-mean-drugs-not-prescribed-enough.html", "doc-class": "Living Document", "twitter": {"description": "Professor Sir Rory Collins said recent studies had created 'misleading uncertainty' about the drugs.
