( Greg Wahl-Stephens )\n\nCORVALLIS, Ore. -- Colorado coach Mike MacIntyre's first encounter with a Pac-12 Conference opponent on the road Saturday looked a lot like those of his predecessor.\n\nMissed tackles, special teams mistakes, ineffective offense and the home team's side of the scoreboard rolling up big numbers in a 44-17 loss.\n\nThe question aching to be answered by the Buffs entering Saturday's first road game of the season at Oregon State was how they might respond following a three-week layoff caused by the flooding back home in Boulder. MacIntyre said he didn't believe the layoff was a factor in his team's performance.\n\n\"Play better, don't turn the ball over, throw the ball to the right guys,\" MacIntyre said when asked what it will take for the Buffs to be more competitive in the Pac-12. \"... I think we have the talent to play with Oregon State. There's no doubt in my mind.\"\n\nCU has now lost nine straight conference games dating back to the Pac-12 opener last season at Washington State.\n\nWhile the conditions at Reser Stadium were familiar -- rain and wind -- the response from the Buffs was all too familiar, as well. The defense did its part for a half against a potent Oregon State passing attack, but the offense looked an awful lot like the 2012 version.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOregon State erupted in the third quarter for 24 unanswered points and made a laugher out of what had been a closer game. The Beavers finished with 540 yards of total offense and quarterback Sean Mannion threw for six touchdown passes.\n\nOSU outgained CU 367 yards to 33 in the second and third quarters combined. It was a stretch that decided the game. CU didn't find the end zone until 11 minutes were left.\n\nTwo special teams blunders by the CU kickoff return unit made it easier than it should have been.\n\nMarques Mosley fumbled a kickoff return that didn't lead to any points but added momentum to the Beavers' efforts. OSU also successfully recovered a short kickoff that allowed it to score back-to-back touchdowns with the CU offense never touching the ball.\n\n\"We've got to do a better job of coaching them and keep taking care of the football,\" MacIntyre said. \"It's all about turnovers.\"\n\nThe magic made between quarterback Connor Wood and wide receiver Paul Richardson in the first two games of the season disappeared in this one. Richardson came into the game leading the nation with 208 yards receiving per game. By the end of the third quarter, he had caught just one pass for two yards and mostly was a non-factor.\n\nOregon State quarterback Sean Mannion (4) congratulates Caleb Smith (10) on his touchdown reception during the first half Saturday. ( Greg Wahl-Stephens )\n\nThe contest was billed as a matchup of two of the best receivers in the nation and the Pac-12 with Oregon State's Brandin Cooks ranked second nationally in receiving yards per game.\n\nCooks definitely left a more favorable impression, making plays in the passing and running game for the Beavers. He finished with nine catches for 168 yards and five carries for 47 yards.\n\nRichardson couldn't get the ball because Wood either couldn't get it to him or didn't have time to. Wood faced consistent pressure from an Oregon State defensive line that had its way against a well-rested Colorado offensive line.\n\nWood completed only 14 of 34 passes for 146 yards with two interceptions and two touchdowns. Richardson caught five passes for 70 yards and a late touchdown. It was obviously a far cry from the production that had the CU passing game ranked seventh best in the nation entering the day.\n\n\"You really can't put your finger on one thing that went wrong, like, 'This was it.'\" Wood said. \"I think all facets of the game, special teams made mistakes, defense made mistakes. They did really well in the first half and then offense, we made our fair share as well.\"\n\nWood said the CU offense was very prepared for what it saw from the Oregon State defense and the Beavers didn't do anything that surprised him.\n\nThe bright spot in the CU offense was true freshman running back Michael Adkins II who rushed 14 times for 98 yards and could soon be the team's new starter.\n\n\"I don't know if he's the starter, but he's going to play,\" MacIntyre said. \"Wouldn't you play him?\"\n\nOregon State struggled to move the ball early, but quarterback Mannion, the nation's leading passer coming into the game, connected with Cooks for a 52-yard gain in double coverage late in first quarter. Mannion, who finished 27 of 52 for 414 yards, connected with Cooks on a pair of touchdown passes later.\n\nThe Buffs now must regroup to host No. 2 Oregon next week.\n\n\"You can't look at this as a failure at all,\" Wood said. \"You got to look at it as a learning experience. That how great players, that's how they think.\"\n\nContact staff writer Kyle Ringo at ringok@dailycamera.com or twitter.com/kyleringo.\n\nOregon State 44, Colorado 17\n\nColorado 3 0 0 14--17\n\nOregon St. 10 7 21 6--44\n\nFirst Quarter\n\nOrSt -- FG Romaine 36, 10:03.\n\nCol -- FG Oliver 19, 6:19.\n\nOrSt -- Smith 3 pass from Mannion (Romaine kick), 2:09.\n\nSecond Quarter\n\nOrSt -- Cooks 8 pass from Mannion (Romaine kick), :16.\n\nThird Quarter\n\nOrSt -- Cooks 22 pass from Mannion (Romaine kick), 12:03.\n\nOrSt -- Ward 42 pass from Mannion (Romaine kick), 6:48.\n\nOrSt -- Smith 4 pass from Mannion (Romaine kick), 5:13.\n\nFourth Quarter\n\nCol -- McCulloch 24 pass from C.Wood (Ross pass from C.Wood), 10:51.\n\nOrSt -- Hamlett 11 pass from Mannion (run failed), 6:48.\n\nCol -- Richardson 28 pass from C.Wood (pass failed), :13.\n\nA -- 44,279.\n\nCol OrSt\n\nFirst downs 14 29\n\nRushes-yards 35-154 34-120\n\nPassing 146 420\n\nComp-Att-Int 14-34-2 28-54-1\n\nReturn Yards 36 35\n\nPunts-Avg. 10-41.1 7-44.1\n\nFumbles-Lost 2-2 2-1\n\nPenalties-Yards 6-64 6-40\n\nTime of Possession 25:10 34:50\n\nINDIVIDUAL STATISTICS\n\nRUSHING -- Colorado, Adkins 14-98, T.Jones 4-22, Powell 10-21, C.Wood 5-8, Richardson 1-7, Team 1-(minus 2).
