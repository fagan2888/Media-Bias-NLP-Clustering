John Bel Edwards spoke in Lafayette last week. (Photo: Ken Stickney, The Daily Advertiser)Buy Photo\n\nGov. John Bel Edwards\u2019 decision to expand Medicaid in Louisiana is no surprise, nor should it draw an outcry. There is imminent good sense in accepting federal dollars for a program that benefits the working poor, as long as it stays afloat.\n\nIt fulfills an Edwards\u2019 campaign pledge and, in his mind, makes good sense for state finances and for Louisiana\u2019s working poor. Elected officials should be expected to try to deliver on their promises, right?\n\nREAD MORE: Obama approves\n\nFormer Gov. Bobby Jindal vehemently opposed Louisiana\u2019s participation in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, which provides for Medicaid expansion for states, but his every move, it seems, was fueled by political motivation. Other Republican governors joined him in especially large numbers in the Southeast.\n\nSome of Jindal's pointed criticisms held merit, but turning down federal money, especially nowadays, does not.\n\nReasons for expanding Medicaid under President Barack Obama\u2019s plan include some of those cited by Edwards in promoting it: The federal government picks up most of the tab; it provides care for the working poor who cannot otherwise afford it; the infusion of federal cash benefits Louisiana\u2019s economy.\n\nREAD MORE: We can care for poor\n\nThose who oppose it, too, have plausible points: The federal government is already mired in debt; states, which must balance their budgets, must find new money to match federal funds; and there is no guaranty the program is sustainable.\n\nEven this week, UnitedHealth announced it will back out of most of its participation in the state exchanges; the company lost a billion dollars over the last two years.\n\nNonetheless, Louisiana will likely see the benefits Edwards promised, at least in the short term. The feds will pick up most of the cost of the program for the decade, pumping new dollars into Louisiana. Those dollars will do additional good when multiplier effects play out in the state\u2019s economy. The state\u2019s safety net hospitals will likely benefit from the guaranteed payments for working poor who show up at their doors.\n\nMost importantly, families with incomes of 138 percent of the poverty level \u2014 about $16,000 for individuals, $33,000 for families of four \u2014 will get some medical attention they\u2019ve previously been denied.\n\nChristine Berry, director of Insurance Studies at the University of Louisiana at Monroe, said there is little downside to Edwards' decision. Some 300,000 people may be insured, the state will save big money and the poor had to be treated somehow, somewhere. The concern, she said, was that the 10 percent match would be a huge state expense, but the working poor would wind up in safety net emergency rooms anyway, costing Louisiana plenty. Why not take the federal money?\n\nIs Obamacare the final or best answer? Probably not. But it's what's available. Use it, and look for better answers.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://www.theadvertiser.com/story/opinion/2016/04/23/editorial-now-expansion-sensible/83306588/", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Gov.
