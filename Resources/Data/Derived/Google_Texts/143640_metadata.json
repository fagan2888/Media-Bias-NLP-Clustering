The filter lets users take a selfie in Snapchat and then alters the image to make the user look like Marley, complete with dreadlocks, a colorful hat and brown skin. Comments have been edited for spelling and grammar.\n\nJoin the conversation by \u201cliking\u201d The Jackson Sun\u2019s Facebook page at facebook.com/JacksonSun.\n\nRodney N Angela Tharp: Actually it\u2019s called Bob Marley. I didn\u2019t see anything about it being called blackface on mine. There are all kinds of filters. Today there is one called Time Traveling Bong that changes scenes every time you open your mouth like you are blowing smoke. Why aren\u2019t they offended by that?\n\nHolly Bahm: This is beyond stupid! Snapchat is for fun! What\u2019s next \u2013 the older people are going to say they are offended because one filter is old? Overweight people are gonna be offended by the ones that make you fat and spew food out of your mouth?! People need to grow up!! This world is full of pathetic whiny people who have to make everything an issue or about race! It\u2019s pathetic!!\n\nDonna Williams Hargrove: I\u2019m confused \u2013 aren\u2019t people using this app because they LIKE Bob Marley? They are not making fun of him. They want to look like him.\n\nCheri Johnson Spencer: Actually they created the Bob M lens to commemorate the date as it relates to smoking weed, which was part of his religion. It has nothing to do with color, but ...\n\nDonna Williams Hargrove: That\u2019s what I thought. I guess I thought it was being complimentary of Bob Marley but looks like the whole thing got twisted around. I\u2019m just gonna leave it right there.\n\nPaul Lindsey: You would think so. Offended, everybody\u2019s offended.\n\nCheri Johnson Spencer: Maybe a Willie Nelson lens on April 20 next year.\n\nPaul Lindsey: I think that\u2019s an excellent idea.\n\nDonna Williams Hargrove: I think Willie would like it, too!\n\nMary Ann Owens: What I don\u2019t get is why people chose to be offended because they used his face instead of being offended because Snapchat has reduced Bob Marley to a poster boy for weed instead of the best reggae musician of all time. I just don\u2019t understand people anymore. It is basically a Bob Marley mask. It\u2019s not like people painted their face and put on some dreads.\n\nScott Reeves: It doesn\u2019t even look like Bob. I\u2019m outraged!\n\nBrandon McManis: Is this country this sensitive? Or is it a slow news day?\n\nAngela Oliver: I\u2019m so sick of everyone being so offended by everything!\n\nBrian Renfroe: This is the dumbest thing I\u2019ve ever seen.\n\nJennifer Leanne Yelverton: Don\u2019t understand why it\u2019s bad\n\nCheri Johnson Spencer: They also have the \u201cold person\u201d lens. That\u2019s hurtful to us old folks.\n\nTENNCARE MISERY METER\n\nLt. Gov. Ron Ramsey\u2019s, House Speaker Beth Harwell\u2019s and the Tennessee General Assembly\u2019s lack of leadership and urgency and failure to expand TennCare under the Affordable Care Act are bringing misery to an estimated 280,000 Tennesseans who could have received health insurance, including an estimated 30,000 veterans. Meanwhile, the financial stability of hospitals is at risk, and workers could lose their jobs. It is costing Tennesseans an estimated $2.5 million per day. The loss to date is:\n\n$2,617,500,000\n\nRead or Share this story: http://www.jacksonsun.com/story/opinion/readers/2016/04/25/readers-react-bob-marley-filter-snapchat/83517544/", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Selected responses on a Facebook post about a controversial Bob Marley filter on Snapchat.", "og": {"site_name": "The Jackson Sun", "description": "Selected responses on a Facebook post about a controversial Bob Marley filter on Snapchat.", "title": "Readers react to Bob Marley filter on Snapchat", "url": "http://www.jacksonsun.com/story/opinion/readers/2016/04/25/readers-react-bob-marley-filter-snapchat/83517544/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/jacksonsun.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Selected responses on a Facebook post about a controversial Bob Marley filter on Snapchat.", "title": "Readers react to Bob Marley filter on Snapchat", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/d30f760c22e68bc1889a7853d8b55c6374f5715c/c=404-0-1098-694&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2016/04/25/JacksonTN/B9321904722Z.1_20160425181151_000_GOHE68IH5.1-0.png.jpg", "creator": "@JSunNews", "site": "@JSunNews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=893610877", "fb": {"app_id": 174739675893665}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070"}, "article_summary": "I guess I thought it was being complimentary of Bob Marley but looks like the whole thing got twisted around.\nSelected responses to a post on The Jackson Sun\u2019s Facebook page about controversy over a Snapchat filter that attempts to honor late reggae icon Bob Marley.\nRodney N Angela Tharp: Actually it\u2019s called Bob Marley.\nIt is basically a Bob Marley mask.\nDonna Williams Hargrove: I\u2019m confused \u2013 aren\u2019t people using this app because they LIKE Bob Marley?"}
