Each senator is to designate staff on Capitol Hill as \u201cofficial,\u201d which under federal rules means employer-provided insurance must be purchased through the Affordable Care Act\u2019s health care exchanges.\n\n\u201cRepublican senators made a strong, principled statement today in passing my resolution,\u201d said Sen. David Vitter, the Louisiana Republican who pushed for the vote. \u201cWashington should have to live under Obamacare just like everybody else until we repeal it. And we won\u2019t be complicit in Obama\u2019s illegal rule designed to protect Washington insiders.\u201d\n\nSEE ALSO: The unfairness of Obamacare\n\nThe resolution passed by voice vote with no \u201cnays.\u201d It challenges Senate Democrats to follow the Republicans\u2019 lead, though that\u2019s unlikely.\n\nThe move contrasts with the House, where Republicans last month rejected a similar proposal.\n\nAlso Wednesday, Senate Republicans voted to continue the ban on earmarks, or the requests lawmakers slip into bills to fund favorite projects back home.\n\nSEE ALSO: Kathleen Sebelius: \u2018Obamacare, no question, has a very bad brand\u2019\n\n\u201cThe American people are tired of wasteful government spending and special interest handouts,\u201d said Sen. Patrick J. Toomey, the Pennsylvania Republican who led the anti-earmark effort. \u201cTaxpayers don\u2019t want to pay for bridges to nowhere, studies on maple syrup or the cowboy poetry festival.\u201d\n\nOn Obamacare, Congress is walking a fine line between political optics and pleasing their staff members, many of whom don\u2019t want to give up their insurance under the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program and instead buy policies through the health care exchanges.\n\nThe 2010 law required that members of Congress and their staffs join the same exchanges they were imposing on millions of other Americans.\n\nBut fearing good staffers would leave, some lawmakers designated only some of their employees as \u201cofficial.\u201d Those who escaped that designation are still allowed to get coverage under the regular federal employees program, which is considered generous.\n\nLawmakers don\u2019t even have to disclose how many of their staffers they put into each category, which Mr. Vitter would like to change through his legislation.\n\nRepublican lawmakers on both sides of the Capitol are plotting to chip away at unpopular parts of the law in the coming Congress and plan to use their new majority in the Senate to hold votes that Democrats have denied them over the past four years.\n\nSen.-elect Bill Cassidy, Louisiana Republican, said he supported Mr. Vitter\u2019s resolution. He said all his staff members would use the exchanges.\n\n\u201cIf it\u2019s good enough for the American people to live under the indignity of the exchanges, as difficult and as expensive as they are, it\u2019s better that those who are writing the law or helping to write the law would also live under that indignity and that expense,\u201d he said. \u201cOtherwise, the law will never change.\u201d\n\nStill to come is a fight over whether lawmakers and staff should continue to collect a federal subsidy that pays up to 75 percent of their health care premiums if they buy insurance on the District of Columbia small-business exchange.\n\nMr. Vitter wants to cancel that subsidy, saying members of Congress, their employees and top officials in the executive branch shouldn\u2019t have any benefits in using the exchange that are out of reach for regular Americans.\n\nHe tried to force a vote on that proposal, but Senate Democrats blocked him from attaching it as an amendment to certain bills.\n\nThe resolution Republicans adopted Wednesday does not take a stand on the matter one way or another.\n\nSubsidy or not, a pair of glitches on the D.C. health care exchange have caused problems for some Capitol Hill staff members renewing or amending their coverage for 2015, exchange officials said this week.\n\nSome customers are finding out that they cannot document a life event, such as adding a spouse or baby to their coverage, on their own because the process is not fully automated.\n\n\u201cWe have to do that for you,\u201d said Mila Kofman, executive director of the D.C. Health Benefit Exchange Authority.\n\nIt is not clear how many people are affected by the issue, but it is \u201cnot just a few people,\u201d she said.\n\nIn other cases, the system did not properly update customers\u2019 personal information for the 2015 coverage year, so customers who wanted to make changes to existing coverage ran into problems.\n\nPeople who are creating accounts for the first time, or automatically renewing coverage they had last year, should not run into trouble, according to the exchange.\n\nThe Senate disbursing office, which handles pay and benefits, sent a mass email early this week that asked staff who encountered problems on D.C. Health Link to notify the office by Monday.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Senate Republicans voted Wednesday to abide by Obamacare by requiring all their staffers to sign up for insurance on the health care exchanges, a move designed to take the moral high ground when the GOP takes control of the chamber next year and moves to repeal the health care law altogether.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Senate Republicans voted Wednesday to abide by Obamacare by requiring all their staffers to sign up for insurance on the health care exchanges, a move designed to take the moral high ground when the GOP takes control of the chamber next year and moves to repeal the health care law altogether.", "title": "Obamacare mandatory for Senate Republicans\u2019 staffers after David Vitter resolution passes", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/dec/10/obamacare-mandatory-for-senate-republicans-staffer/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/12/10/12102014_ap4391386188258201.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/12/10/12102014_ap4391386188258201.jpg", "description": "Senate Republicans voted Wednesday to abide by Obamacare by requiring all their staffers to sign up for insurance on the health care exchanges, a move designed to take the moral high ground when the G", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Obamacare mandatory for Senate Republicans\u2019 staffers after David"}, "Author": "Tom Howell Jr.", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Social Issues, Politics, Senate, David Vitter, Congress"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd5d9\"", "article_summary": "Also Wednesday, Senate Republicans voted to continue the ban on earmarks, or the requests lawmakers slip into bills to fund favorite projects back home.\nThe resolution Republicans adopted Wednesday does not take a stand on the matter one way or another.\n\u201cRepublican senators made a strong, principled statement today in passing my resolution,\u201d said Sen.
