Still, this seems like maybe it\u2019s a new click of the old \u201cHe\u2019s not one of us!\u201d hyperbole ratchet, possibly: North Carolina Congressn00b Robert Pittenger has sent out a fundraising letter warning that the POTUS is actually an enemy of the United States of America:\n\nYou see, I am already on the front lines, taking seriously my oath of office: to defend the U.S. Constitution \u2014 and you and your fellow Americans \u2014 against all enemies, foreign and domestic. And for that I am being attacked from all sides, including from my fellow Republicans. My friend, make no mistake, Barack Obama is Enemy Number One!\n\nIs this new? Maybe just a teensy step over the line? Honestly, we think it might actually be a novelty, in that it\u2019s not some blogger somewhere, but an actual member of Congress, the guy who chairs the Congressional Terrorism Task Force, who\u2019s saying not merely that Obama should be impeached, but that he is an actual enemy of the nation, and a worse enemy than, say, al Qaeda. Correct us if we\u2019re wrong, but that feels like a new one.\n\nThe envelope the letter comes in points out in large friendly letters that Pittenger is the \u201cChairman of the Congressional Taskforce on Terrorism & Unconventional Warfare,\u201d so he pretty much knows who America\u2019s enemies are, and it turns out that our greatest enemy is not al Qaeda or Vladimir Putin or any of those foreign terrors, but the winner of the 2012 presidential election. You want proof? Not only will Obamacare bankrupt America and abort all the babbies, Pittenger, who has been in Congress a little over a whole year now, knows that Obama is motivated by his \u201cIslamo-Communist upbringing,\u201d which is all the proof that you need.\n\nNow, we do have one or two quibbles with Pittenger\u2019s declaration that Barack Obama is a Public Enemy. For one thing, we don\u2019t think he\u2019s ever worn a comically large clock medallion. And for another, we\u2019re pretty sure he\u2019s never smooshed a grapefruit into Mae Clarke\u2019s face.\n\nIn any case, we urge Congressman Pittenger to share his findings with the FBI, which doesn\u2019t even list the President on its Ten Most Wanted list. And we\u2019d also like to congratulate him on winning an instant nomination for Wonkette\u2019s coveted award for Legislative Shitmuffin of the Year.\n\n[AndrewSullivan]", "article_metadata": {"description": "We aren't even sure that it's news any more when a Republican says that the President of the United States is the worstest most horrible person ever, because", "generator": "Powered by Visual Composer - drag and drop page builder for WordPress.", "author": "Doktor Zoom", "og": {"url": "http://wonkette.com/543147/north-carolina-congressional-freshman-declares-barack-obama-terrorist-enemy-number-one", "image": "http://img.wonkette.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/default.png", "title": "North Carolina Congressional Freshman Declares Barack Obama Terrorist Enemy Number One"}, "twitter": {"description": "We aren't even sure that it's news any more when a Republican says \u2026", "title": "North Carolina Congressional Freshman Declares Barack Obama Terrorist Enemy Number One", "url": "http://wonkette.com/543147/north-carolina-congressional-freshman-declares-barack-obama-terrorist-enemy-number-one", "image": "http://img.wonkette.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/default.png", "creator": "@wonkette", "site": "@wonkette", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf1a6\"", "article_summary": "And for another, we\u2019re pretty sure he\u2019s never smooshed a grapefruit into Mae Clarke\u2019s face.\nFor one thing, we don\u2019t think he\u2019s ever worn a comically large clock medallion.\nMy friend, make no mistake, Barack Obama is Enemy Number One!\nNow, we do have one or two quibbles with Pittenger\u2019s declaration that Barack Obama is a Public Enemy.\nAnd we\u2019d also like to congratulate him on winning an instant nomination for Wonkette\u2019s coveted award for Legislative Shitmuffin of the Year."}
