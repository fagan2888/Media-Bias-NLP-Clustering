Shannon Sharpe, a Broncos legend with Hall of Fame credentials, has a simple question for suspended linebacker Von Miller: Is football more important to you than partying?

In an interview on The Press Box radio show, Sharpe brought it strong on the subject of Miller, Denver’s talented star. I asked what he would say to Miller if given the chance for a heart-to-heart chat. The answer was blunt. Sharpe would tell Miller: “Enough … enough with the bull jive.”

It was compelling stuff. Watch it all in the above video.

Sharpe said he would be willing to fly back to Denver to talk with Miller? Do you think that would be a good idea?
