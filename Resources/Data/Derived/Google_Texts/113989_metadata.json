The letter said her mammogram was clean but that she has dense breast tissue, which has been linked to higher rates of breast cancer and could make her mammogram harder to read. \u201cI honestly don\u2019t know what to think about the letter,\u201d said Hoadley, 45, who lives in Alameda, California. \u201cWhat do I do with that information?\u201d Millions of women like Hoadley may be wondering the same thing. Twenty-one states, including California, have passed laws requiring health facilities to notify women when they have dense breasts. Eleven other states are considering similar laws and a nationwide version has been introduced in Congress. The laws have been hailed by advocates as empowering women to take charge of their own health. About 40 percent of women have dense or extremely dense breast tissue, which can obscure cancer that might otherwise be detected on a mammogram.\n\nBut critics say the laws cause women unnecessary anxiety and can lead to higher costs and treatment that doesn\u2019t save lives or otherwise benefit patients. \u201cWhile I think the intent of these laws is well meaning, I think their impact is going to be a significant problem, where we end up doing more harm than good,\u201d said Laura Esserman, a University of California-San Francisco surgeon and breast-cancer specialist. \"I honestly don\u2019t know what to think about the letter. What do I do with that information?\" Typically, the laws require a notice be sent to a woman if she has dense breast tissue seen on a mammogram. Some notifications suggest that a woman talk to her doctor about additional screening options. But in some states, not including California, the laws go further by requiring health providers to offer a supplemental screening like an ultrasound to women with dense breasts even if their mammograms are clean. Connecticut, Illinois, and Indiana even require insurers to pay for screening ultrasound after mammography if a woman\u2019s breast density falls above a certain threshold. Otherwise insurers do not routinely cover supplemental screening for women with clean mammograms, even if they have dense breasts. The Affordable Care Act does not require it. The problem, Esserman says, is that no medical consensus exists on whether routine supplemental screening for women with dense breasts is worthwhile. A recent Annals of Internal Medicine study using computer modeling found that offering an ultrasound to women with dense breasts after a clean mammogram would not significantly improve breast-cancer survival rates but would prompt many unnecessary biopsies and raise healthcare costs. Another study conducted in Connecticut after its notification law went into effect found that supplemental ultrasound screening for women with dense breasts did find a few additional cancers\u2014about three per 1,000 women screened\u2014but the probability that such screenings would find life-threatening cancers was low.\n\nDense breast notification laws have added another layer of complexity to the long-running and often emotional debate over how best to screen women for breast cancer. Breast cancer is the second most common form of cancer among American women, behind skin cancers, and the second leading cause of cancer death. An estimated 231,840 U.S. women will be diagnosed with invasive breast cancer in 2015, according to the American Cancer Society.

Emerging technologies like tomosynthesis, a 3-D digital x-ray of the breast, may become cheap enough to replace conventional mammography and make the notification laws irrelevant, but their widespread use is years away. For a long time, women were advised to start yearly mammograms at about age 40, but in 2009, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force issued controversial recommendations that most women without a family history of breast cancer or other risk factors should wait until age 50 to begin mammograms, and repeat them every two years. Patient advocates decried the recommendations as \u201crationing\u201d preventive healthcare for women. In the meantime, Nancy Cappello, an education administrator from Connecticut, was pushing to pass what became the nation\u2019s first dense-breast notification law. Just two months after a clean mammogram, she had been diagnosed with breast cancer that had spread to her lymph nodes. She had extremely dense breasts, something her radiologist knew but Cappello was not told. Dense breasts have more glandular and fibrous tissue, which block the X-rays used in mammograms more than fatty tissue does. Eventually, she founded the patient advocacy organization and took her campaign national. \u201cThere\u2019s no evidence that we\u2019re scaring women. Most women I\u2019ve talked to are very happy to get these notifications,\u201d said Cappello, whose cancer is in remission. \u201cWe want to make informed decisions \u2026 to have a better chance of surviving the disease.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "A growing number of states are requiring doctors to tell women when they have dense tissue, but some say the knowledge only causes unnecessary fear.", "author": "Barbara Feder Ostrov", "og": {"site_name": "The Atlantic", "description": "A growing number of states are requiring doctors to tell women when they have dense tissue, but some say the knowledge only causes unnecessary fear.", "title": "What Dense Breasts Mean for Cancer Risk", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2015/04/RTX57ZF/lead_large.jpg", "url": "http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2015/04/what-dense-breasts-mean-for-cancer-risk/390729/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "theatlantic.com", "site": "@theatlantic", "card": "summary"}, "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "p": {"domain_verify": "68e1a0361a557708fefc992f3309ed70"}, "fb": {"admins": "577048155,17301937", "page_id": 29259828486, "app_id": 100770816677686}, "keywords": "The Atlantic, The Atlantic Magazine, TheAtlantic.com, Atlantic, news, opinion, breaking news, analysis, commentary, business, politics, culture, international, science, technology, national and life", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, width=device-width, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2f3a\"", "article_summary": "About 40 percent of women have dense or extremely dense breast tissue, which can obscure cancer that might otherwise be detected on a mammogram.\nBreast cancer is the second most common form of cancer among American women, behind skin cancers, and the second leading cause of cancer death.\nAn estimated 231,840 U.S. women will be diagnosed with invasive breast cancer in 2015, according to the American Cancer Society.\nShe had extremely dense breasts, something her radiologist knew but Cappello was not told.\nTwenty-one states, including California, have passed laws requiring health facilities to notify women when they have dense breasts."}
