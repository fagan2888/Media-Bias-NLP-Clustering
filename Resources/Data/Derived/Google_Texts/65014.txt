Fainting can be uncomfortable and pretty embarrassing, especially if it is caught on camera. A new video posted by pop culture site "Mandatory" exposes people who fainted on live television.

It’s common in movies to see girls faint at the sight of their crush, or when extremely surprising and stressful situations.

The medical term for what we see on the big screen is "vasovagal fainting." And it happens to be the most common form of fainting. It can be triggered by pain or anxiety, which can explain why some people faint after hearing bad news or when they are extremely fatigued. Fainting is usually harmless, but it could be a symptom of a more serious condition. Injuries from normal fainting spells can also be dangerous, especially if you hit your head.

A new video posted by a pop culture site for men, “Mandatory", shows the more entertaining side of fainting: when it's captured on live television. Some might really surprise you. Check out the video for yourself:
