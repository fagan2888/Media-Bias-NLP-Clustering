We would never let that happen.\"\n\nThe current health care environment has meant real threats to the survival of small rural hospitals.\n\n\"The reason we started looking at this is we're facing a very challenging time in health care, especially in Texas,\" she said.\n\nAfter the Affordable Care Act was passed, the idea was that hospitals would take cuts to Medicare payments and, in return, would spend less on indigent care because most patients would have health insurance.\n\nBecause the state's Republican leadership has opposed expanding Medicaid to low-income adults, hospital operators said they are forced to make do with less funding and paying for savings they didn't receive.\n\nTexas is also the state with the highest percentage of people without health insurance.\n\nGjolberg agreed the hospital is in a sound financial position and not at risk of being sold.\n\nShould Cuero reach an agreement with Methodist, the hospital would have access to discounts on purchases that are usually only available to larger hospitals.\n\n\"Cuero hospital is doing well,\" he said. \"We've had to be real proactive and smart because rural hospitals are struggling right now.\"\n\nSHARE", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "//media.victoriaadvocate.com/vicad/static/img/icons/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "og": {"url": "https://www.victoriaadvocate.com/news/2015/aug/28/cuero-community-hospital-considers-affiliation-wit/", "image": "https://media.victoriaadvocate.com/img/photos/2015/08/28/Cuero_hospital_lg_082915_278641.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Many rural hospitals in Texas struggle financially to stay afloat, and some have resorted to closure.
