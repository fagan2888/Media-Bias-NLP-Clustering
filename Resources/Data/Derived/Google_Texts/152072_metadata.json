On closer inspection, however, I\u2019m beginning to suspect it\u2019s a tinfoil hat. We have been told once again, for the 443rd time, that sooner or later all the leathery, old, white Republicans will wither away and Democrats will inherit the earth. Sounds good in theory, but I have two questions: What Democrats? And what earth?\n\nThere was another insane GOP candidates\u2019 debate, on a night when I was called away to watch the new \u201cStar Wars\u201d movie \u2013 which, whatever its flaws, had fewer problems with continuity and clarity. This debate was purportedly about foreign policy, which in Republican-land is a nebulous realm synonymous with one of those horror movies where the killer is inside the house. In all seriousness, when did right-wingers get so damn scared about everything? It would be funny if it weren\u2019t also gruesome and grotesque: Republicans are supposed to be the testosterone party of rugged American individualism, as seen in Chevy Silverado commercials, and what I saw on that stage was not John Wayne facing down two dozen Comanche warriors but a bunch of lardass dudes with boiled-lobster complexions and quivering jowls, terrified of the invisible Muslim mice under the bed.\n\nAll these debates are unhinged from reality by definition, but this one was special. If Abbott and Costello had dropped acid in the \u201870s and made a film with Bertolucci or Fassbinder \u2013 well, it would have been more fun than this. Chris Christie shouted into the camera that he would stand across from King Hussein and vow undying friendship in a way our current president simply cannot. Which is a little bit true, since the longtime ruler of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan departed for other shores in 1999. (Of course I am tempted to crack a joke about the fiery climes where he and Christie will meet one day, but His Late Majesty does not deserve that.)\n\nCarly Fiorina continues to make great strides for women, smashing the glass ceiling of mendacity, then Supergluing it back together and smashing it again. Already famous for the gory Planned Parenthood video she apparently saw while on a vision-quest (since it exists not in this world), Fiorina now insists that a general who retired five years before Obama was elected \u2013 wait, hang on, a general who retired before Obama was elected to the Senate \u2014 was actually fired for giving the president unwelcome news. \u201cNo I wasn\u2019t,\u201d said Gen. Jack Keane, the person in question. \u201cYou were, General, you were,\u201d said Morgan le Fay \u2013 sorry, Fiorina \u2013 weaving ancient, smoky magic with her lithe fingers and flashing eyes. \u201cEnter my castle and I will unbind your tongue.\u201d\n\nAt least that\u2019s how I heard it \u2013 that part admittedly does not show up in the transcript. I\u2019m not sure what Donald Trump said in the debate, because I honestly can\u2019t listen to that guy anymore. But Vladimir Putin has stopped ignoring Trump\u2019s cards and flowers! Cue the violins, because the 21st century\u2019s greatest rom-com is nearing the meet-cute: Trump once called Putin his \u201cstable mate,\u201d and don\u2019t even pretend that\u2019s not hot. I\u2019m sensing a friendly, sweaty wrassle in the hay, where eyes meet and passions can no longer be contained. This week the Russian president described the GOP frontrunner as \u201ca bright and talented person without any doubt,\u201d not to mention \u201can outstanding and talented personality.\u201d (Translation issues? Or does Putin always sound like a Miss Universe judge?)\n\nWere it possible for Trump to blush crimson through the layers of weaponized money applied to his outermost hide, he would have. Asked by Joe Scarborough on MSNBC about Putin\u2019s propensity for eliminating dissidents and invading other countries, Trump responded, \u201cAt least he\u2019s a leader, unlike what we have in this country. Furthermore, Joe, if loving him is wrong, I don\u2019t want to be right.\u201d OK, so that sentence is also absent from the transcript. Just ask Carly \u2013 that\u2019s how she heard it! Anyway, I insist on taking some credit here, because I either predicted this glorious bromance or caused it to happen, I\u2019m not sure which.\n\nI won\u2019t try to be amusing about the steady drumbeat of cable-news fear-mongering over a perceived terrorist threat that lies somewhere between insignificant and imaginary, but of course that wasn\u2019t limited to this week alone. During that godawful CNN debate, Hugh Hewitt asked Ben Carson whether he had the stones \u201cto kill innocent children by not the scores but the hundreds and the thousands,\u201d in the name of our endless jihad against jihad. Because that\u2019s what presidents do, evidently. Some lady in the Virginia boondocks had a dozen Christian kittens over her kid\u2019s middle-school assignment to transcribe the shahada, or Muslim declaration of faith, in Arabic calligraphy. (Yeah, the teacher could have picked a different text, but we\u2019re still talking Morons Gone Wild here.) Apparently there have been at least 38 hate crimes against Muslims or mosques in the United States since the Paris attacks, triple the normal rate.\n\nThat brings us back, however reluctantly, to the Democrats, who have hidden away their last pre-Iowa presidential debate on the Saturday night of \u201cStar Wars\u201d weekend. No, I\u2019m not claiming that was part of some brilliant Clintonista master plan \u2013 the same one some Republicans discern behind the Trump campaign \u2013 but it\u2019s kind of working out that way. In theory, this could or should have been a big week for Bernie Sanders, who received his biggest single endorsement of the campaign from the Communications Workers of America, an activist union with more than 700,000 members. But Sanders only made the front page this week by way of a kerfuffle over a data breach and some proprietary files his workers apparently lifted from the Clinton campaign. So while everybody else was screaming in abject terror, Bernie was depicted as the bush-league socialist version of Richard Nixon.\n\nAs for Hillary Clinton, her strategy of rope-a-doping her way into the White House by saying and doing as little as possible, while the Republicans set themselves on fire, vow to divert the entire federal budget to the Spanish Inquisition and conjure demons out of Lord Voldemort\u2019s playbook \u2013 that\u2019s looking better all the time. In fairness, Clinton has not aided or abetted the rising tide of anti-Muslim vitriol in any way; her messaging on that issue has been consistent and admirable. But Sanders finally raised an urgent point in this week\u2019s big Guardian interview, suggesting that the Obama administration\u2019s reckless \u201cregime change\u201d policies in Libya and Syria, which Clinton personally directed as secretary of state, helped create the current state of chaos and instability whose disastrous ripple effects now extend around the world.\n\nOne could go a lot further than that. Clinton\u2019s tone and rhetoric have been measured during this campaign, but as Salon\u2019s Bill Curry wrote recently, she remains an unregenerate foreign-policy hawk who shows every sign of yearning to double down on failed military overreach. Whatever you think she may have said, Clinton has absolutely not ruled out sending American troops by the thousands to fight a ground war against the Islamic State. She has called out Republican candidates for their \u201cbluster and bigotry\u201d and rejected talk of a \u201cwar on Islam,\u201d which is all to the good. But the policy proposals discernible below her calm and resolute-sounding language over the last month are virtually indistinguishable from those of the non-Trump GOP contenders: More war, more surveillance, less First Amendment. \u201cYou are going to hear all the familiar complaints: \u2018Freedom of speech,\u2019\u201d she told a Brookings Institution audience on Dec. 6.
