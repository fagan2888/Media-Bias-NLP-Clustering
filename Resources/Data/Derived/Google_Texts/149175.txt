A judge ruled this month that the NCAA prohibiting athletes from getting paid for the use of their names violated antitrust law, perhaps opening the door to pay for play. Comments from Facebook are edited for clarity and grammar:

One of the best things to happen to college football was the scholarship cap. It created parity and breathed life into some mid-major programs. That will soon be obliterated. We are headed toward a new super division in college football, and many Football Bowl Subdivision teams will go from slightly irrelevant to totally irrelevant.

In a free market economy, individuals whose work provides the value should reap some of the rewards. If I made a lot of money for my company, I'd expect to be compensated for it.

Also, don't give me the excuse that amateurs are different from professionals. With millions of dollars involved, there's nothing amateur about college sports. It's also impossible to play at the college level as a marquee athlete without putting in as much time as people put into jobs. It's basically a job.

Why should student-athletes receive some type of compensation other than what they now receive? They are treated like kings on most campuses as it is.

It is about time college athletes reap some of the financial benefits. These schools have been making money off of student-athletes for years!

What happens to these students after their bodies are abused from years of running down basketball courts and football fields? They become afterthoughts to the university, and sometimes the fans. Giving them more compensation is a step in the right direction.
