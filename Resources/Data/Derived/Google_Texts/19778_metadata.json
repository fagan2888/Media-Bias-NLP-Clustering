The index's close was its highest since Dec. 1.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 42.67 points, or 0.2%, to settle at 18,096.27, for its highest finish since late July and a third day of gains. Earlier in the day, the Dow was up as much as 114 points.\n\nThe average was led by a 2.7% gain for Goldman Sachs Group Inc.(GS) and a 2.6% gain by UnitedHealth Group Inc.(UNH), which on Tuesday said it plans to exit by 2017 most of the Affordable Care Act state exchanges where it currently operates. But the blue-chip gauge was weighed down by sharp losses for Coca-Cola Co.(KO), which closed down 4.8%.\n\nMeanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite Index climbed 7.8 points, or 0.2%, to end at 4,948.13.\n\nIt may be too early to tell, but over the past month the market has been supported by formerly beaten down sectors, indicating a possible broader investor rotation into sectors like energy, materials, and industrials, said Paul Nolte, portfolio manager at Kingsview Asset Management. For the year to date, the energy sector is up 11%, materials are up 8%, and industrials are up 6%.\n\nSee:Why the Dow's bullish 'golden cross' could work out this time (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/why-the-dows-bullish-golden-cross-could-work-out-this-time-2016-04-19).\n\nWhat concerns Nolte is that while more stocks are participating in the rally, volume is still running below average. For the month, total composite volume for the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq is running at 6.81 billion shares, compared with a year-to-date average of 8.12 billion, according to Dow Jones data.\n\n\"That tells me that there's a lack of interest in the market, but participation is broad, that's why I'm taking some comfort,\" Nolte said.\n\nOn the data front, investors were cheered by a strong rebound by existing home sales in March (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/existing-home-sales-soar-51-in-march-as-housing-demand-remains-strong-2016-04-20).\n\nThe rally in equities brings stock benchmarks within a stone's throw of records set last May, (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/dow-on-pace-to-rise-further-above-18000-as-stock-futures-gain-2016-04-19) but the relatively rapid rebound from the Feb. 11 lows has some market participants nervous.\n\nThe market was getting \"perilously closer to massive levels of congestive resistance,\" said Tim Anderson, managing director at MND Partners, in emailed comments.\n\nOne factor that has helped boost stocks is crude-oil prices, which have been viewed as a gauge of the health of the broader market, although that linkage has periodically weakened in recent sessions.\n\n\"If the oil sector continues to rally and banks can hold most of their gains from the February lows, don't discount the possibility of new highs on the S&P 500,\" Anderson said.\n\nRead:Banks are finally rejoining the bull-market party (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/banks-are-finally-rejoining-the-bull-market-party-2016-04-20).\n\nBut others cautioned that the fundamentals don't warrant a significant move higher, as the recent rallies have been driven by undue optimism about corporate earnings that exceeded very low expectations.\n\nIndividual movers:\n\nYahoo Inc.(YHOO) shares gained 4.2% as investors tracked the ailing Internet pioneer's efforts to sell its core business (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/yahoo-bidders-said-to-include-verizon-daily-mail-2016-04-19).\n\nCoca-Cola (KO) shares fell after the beverage giant's quarterly revenue missed forecasts. (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/coca-colas-stock-drops-as-profit-beats-but-sales-miss-2016-04-20) (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/coca-colas-stock-drops-as-profit-beats-but-sales-miss-2016-04-20)\n\nIntel Corp.(INTC) shares turned positive, closing up 1.3%, despite the chip giant late Tuesday cutting its revenue growth forecast and announcing plans to eliminate 12,000 jobs (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/intel-to-cut-12000-jobs-2016-04-19-174852128).\n\nMitsubishi Motors Corp.(7211.TO)(8058.TO) dived 15% in Tokyo. The Japanese auto maker on Wednesday admitted to cheating on fuel-economy tests (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/mitsubishi-admits-to-cheating-in-fuel-economy-tests-2016-04-20), affecting about 625,000 vehicles, including cars made for rival Nissan Motor Co. (NSANY)(NSANY). Investors are sensitive to news about faking tests after Volkswagen AG's (VOW.XE)(VOW.XE) emissions scandal, which erupted last year.\n\nGlobal Payments Inc.(GPN) fell 0.8% following news late Tuesday that the provider of payment services will join the S&P 500 (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/global-payments-to-replace-gamestop-on-sp-500-2016-04-19), replacing retailer GameStop Corp.(GME)\n\nOther markets:European stocks (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/european-stocks-slip-from-three-month-high-2016-04-20) showed little change after paring earlier losses, while Asian markets (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/shanghai-stocks-slide-36-as-china-markets-tumble-2016-04-20) closed mostly lower, with the Shanghai Composite finishing down 2.3% but off its session low. Gold futures ended fractionally higher, and a key dollar index ticked 0.6% higher (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/dollar-drops-against-yen-as-asian-stocks-oil-head-south-2016-04-20).\n\n--Victor Reklaitis in London contributed to this article.\n\n-Wallace Witkowski; 415-439-6400; AskNewswires@dowjones.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\n04-20-16 1630ET\n\nCopyright (c) 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "article_metadata": {"isAuthor": "false", "adDomain": "//msmedia.morningstar.com/mstar/", "description": "UPDATE: U.S. stocks close at 2016 highs as oil rally continues, Read most current stock market news, Get stock, fund, etf analyst reports from an independent source you can trust \u2013 Morningstar", "language": "en_US", "area": "news", "og": {"description": "UPDATE: U.S. stocks close at 2016 highs as oil rally continues, Read most current stock market news, Get stock, fund, etf analyst reports from an independent source you can trust \u2013 Morningstar", "title": "UPDATE: U.S. stocks close at 2016 highs as oil rally continues"}, "uimHost": "https://sso.morningstar.com/sso/", "msvalidate.01": "985532AEAC3A31F64690C69EFA55EF87", "site": "ms.us", "memberDomain": "members.morningstar.com", "isPublish": "true", "dcterms.date": "2016-04-20", "build": "2.50.0-SNAPSHOT", "template": "templatenews", "keywords": "I/IAV,I/SCR,N/DJMW,N/CMD,N/CNW,N/DJWI,N/MKT,N/RUBL,M/FCL,M/NND,M/TPX,P/AEQI,P/BFX,P/GMA,P/MCOL,P/MEN,P/MWM,P/MWMW,P/MWNR,P/MWSN,P/MWWS,P/OAC,P/SGN,R/NME,R/US,F/DELP=", "google-site-verification": "3Ap-qUhJutF7vuC-6nmHXnqzIMjHjOddiGw-YnZ-6PU", "section": "market-watch", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,user-scalable=no", "assetDomain": "//www.msmediacom.com/"}, "article_summary": "-Wallace Witkowski; 415-439-6400; AskNewswires@dowjones.com(END) Dow Jones Newswires04-20-16 1630ETCopyright (c) 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.\n04/20/16 04:30 PM EDTBy Wallace Witkowski and Ellie Ismailidou, MarketWatchCoke tumbles on weak earnings, weighs on DowU.S. stocks closed higher Wednesday, but off session highs, as a turnaround by oil futures and upbeat housing data provided support.\nThe S&P 500 closed up 1.60 points, or 0.1%, at 2,102.40, led by gains in financial and energy stocks, marking a third straight day of gains.\nWhat concerns Nolte is that while more stocks are participating in the rally, volume is still running below average.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 42.67 points, or 0.2%, to settle at 18,096.27, for its highest finish since late July and a third day of gains."}
