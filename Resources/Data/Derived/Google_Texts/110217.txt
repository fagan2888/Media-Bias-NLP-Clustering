MADISON, Alabama - Time will tell if a straw poll the Republican Women of Madison recently conducted will prove prophetic for Dr. Ben Carson.

From its booth at the Madison Street Festival last week, the group held an informal presidential straw poll that produced 17 names for ballot, including two democrats.

Carson, the first surgeon to successfully separate twins conjoined at the head, was the overwhelming winner with 36 percent of the vote. There were 165 participants, the group reported. Mitt Romney came in second with 10 percent of the vote. Mike Huckabee and Rand Paul tied for third with 9 percent.

Though he claims no political party partisanship and advocates the dissolving of political parties, Politico Magazine said Carson became an immediate media darling of conservatives, after he delivered a 27-minute admonishment of Obamacare during the National Prayer Breakfast in 2013.

"Obamacare is the worst thing that has happened in this nation since slavery," he said.

A straw poll by CPAC (Conservative Political Action Conference) showed Carson besting other 2016 hopefuls, such as Chris Christie, Scott Walker and Marco Rubio.
