The program was intended to help Obamacare insurers if they took on too many sick and older Americans.\n\nThe program was meant to help mitigate some of the risk of joining the completely new Obamacare marketplaces.\n\nInsurers requested $2.9 billion but only received $362 million in funds, about 12 percent of what they asked for.\n\nThe reason is that not enough insurers paid in to the program. Insurers whose profits reached a certain threshold were supposed to provide funding to the program.\n\nThe co-ops, created to provide more competition in the Obamacare marketplaces, were particularly vulnerable to the shortfall since they were created back in 2014 and didn't have enough cash reserves to mitigate the lack of funds.\n\nThe Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which oversees the co-ops, has said that it expected some would not survive since they are startups. It has pledged to work with co-ops to ensure their stability.\n\nThe agency didn't immediately return a request for comment.\n\nMost of the Obamacare-funded startups that have closed have cited the low federal payments as a key reason. The administration gave more than $2 billion to set up the startups, of which only 13 remain.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A lack of federal funding from the Obama administration has caused the 10th taxpayer-funded Obamacare insurance startup to close.\nUtah's insurance regulator announced Tuesday that it will place Arches Health Plan in receivership.
