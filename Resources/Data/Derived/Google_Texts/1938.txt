Green Bay - The National Football League will not make fans - and the Packers' opponent - suffer through a potentially bitter cold night when the divisional playoff round starts.

The NFL announced Sunday night that the Packers will host a noon game on Sunday, Jan. 11.

The opponent, of course, is yet to be determined. It depends on the outcome of the wild-card games between Dallas and Detroit and Carolina and Arizona. The Packers will play the highest-seeded winner from next weekend's NFC games. Seattle, the No. 1 seed, will play the lowest-seeded winner.

Here is the playoff schedule through the championship games. All times listed are Central.
