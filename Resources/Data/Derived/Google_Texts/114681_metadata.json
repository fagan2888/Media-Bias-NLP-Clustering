It was located on the south side of the Big Thompson River near Colo. 66 in Tuxedo Park. ( Bobbie Heisterkamp postcard collection )\n\nLong-time residents of the Estes Park area can remember walking to the small store at Camp Woods, located along the south side of the Big Thompson River. Its store and cottages were near the original entrance to Rocky Mountain National Park.\n\nThe meadow was called Tuxedo Park, and in 1915, Jack Woods started with the construction of the store followed by a dozen cabins.\n\nThe entrance road into Moraine Park followed the north bank of the Big Thompson River, and a bridge across the river provided access to Camp Woods. The complex of buildings also included a dining hall, shower house, livery stable and garage. Jack Woods also had his home on the site.\n\nWhen the new bridge over the Big Thompson River in Moraine Park was constructed in 1958, the old Big Thompson entrance was abandoned and Camp Woods was isolated. That year, the National Park Service purchased the site and removed the structures.\n\nToday, the location is difficult to find since all that remains is the ring of rocks that once surrounded the flagpole.\n\nCamp Woods is just one example of the many commercial operations within Rocky Mountain National Park.\n\nKenneth Jessen has been a Loveland resident since 1965. He is an author of 20 books and more than 1,600 articles. He served on several Loveland boards and was an engineer for Hewlett-Packard for 33 years. This year his columns will focus mainly on the history of Rocky Mountain National Park.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.reporterherald.com/columnists/colorado-history/ci_27090329/camp-woods-was-near-original-rocky-mountain-national", "modificationDate": "2014-12-11T21:52:57-0700", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site47/2014/1207/20141207__14rhkjw~2_300.jpg", "sailthru.author": "By Kenneth Jessen", "description": "Long-time residents of the Estes Park area can remember walking to the small store at Camp Woods, located along the south side of the Big Thompson River.", "ag": {"canon": "LovelandReporter-Herald:article:27090329:view"}, "startDate": "2014-12-14T01:00:00-0700", "og": {"url": "http://www.reporterherald.com/columnists/colorado-history/ci_27090329/camp-woods-was-near-original-rocky-mountain-national", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site47/2014/1207/20141207__14rhkjw~1.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Long-time residents of the Estes Park area can remember walking to the small store at Camp Woods, located along the south side of the Big Thompson River.", "title": "Camp Woods was near the original Rocky Mountain National Park entrance"}, "twitter": {"domain": "reporterherald.com", "description": "Long-time residents of the Estes Park area can remember walking to the small store at Camp Woods, located along the south side of the Big Thompson River.", "title": "Camp Woods was near the original Rocky Mountain National Park entrance", "url": "http://www.reporterherald.com/columnists/colorado-history/ci_27090329/camp-woods-was-near-original-rocky-mountain-national", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site47/2014/1207/20141207__14rhkjw~1.jpg", "site": "@reporterherald", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-12-14T01:00:00-0700", "sailthru.site": "reporterherald.com", "endDate": "2024-12-14T01:00:00-0700", "sailthru.title": "Camp Woods was near the original Rocky Mountain National Park entrance", "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "sailthru.section": "Colorado History", "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "google-site-verification": "XzsHDcJw4iXBQEYtDXFRaUAdKzxhSvxWMgXyQQNFFzg", "byline": "By Kenneth Jessen", "sailthru.image.full": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site47/2014/1207/20141207__14rhkjw~2.jpg", "pubDate": "2014-12-11T21:54:25-0700", "news_keywords": "Loveland Colorado ReporterHerald ghost towns"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb45a\"", "article_summary": "Its store and cottages were near the original entrance to Rocky Mountain National Park.\nCamp Woods is just one example of the many commercial operations within Rocky Mountain National Park.\nThis year his columns will focus mainly on the history of Rocky Mountain National Park.\nIt was located on the south side of the Big Thompson River near Colo. 66 in Tuxedo Park.\nWhen the new bridge over the Big Thompson River in Moraine Park was constructed in 1958, the old Big Thompson entrance was abandoned and Camp Woods was isolated."}
