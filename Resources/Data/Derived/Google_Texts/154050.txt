Comedian and former B-List actor Russell Brand told BBC Newsnight host Evan Davis that he was “open-minded” to the idea that the U.S. government was behind the September 11, 2001 terror attacks on New York City and the Pentagon.

During an interview Thursday night, Brand was prompted to respond a quote from his new book Revolution, in which he refers to the destruction of the World Trade Center towers as “what some people say looked like a controlled explosion.”

Davis asked Brand quite bluntly if he believed the Twin Towers were destroyed by “forces of the American government or similar.”

“I think it’s interesting that at this time, where we have to little time in our political figures, where ordinary people have so little trust in their media that we have to remain open-minded to any kind of possibility,” Brand said. “I don’t trust—I don’t know.”

Brand attempted to turn the question on Davis and asked if he trusted the British and American governments.

“My views aren’t really important at this point,” Davis said. “I think most people regard it is ridiculous to suggest anything other than al Qaeda destroyed those buildings.”

Brand then went on a tirade connecting the Bush family to the Bin Ladens and suggested that terror events were simply carried out in order to justify further restraint on British, American and even Canadian citizens.

“What I do think is interesting is that the way that the BBC reported events in Ottawa to subtly build an anti-Islamic narrative,” Brand said. “I think it’s interesting the way these tragic events are used to enforce further controls on us.”

When asked if he is suggesting that the Bush family was involved in 9/11, Brand simply responded he did not want to “talk about daft conspiracy theories.”
