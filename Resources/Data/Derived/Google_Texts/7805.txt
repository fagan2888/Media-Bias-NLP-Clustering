Mountain View wins both team titles, Thompson Valley, Berthoud starting strong

Windsor Invitational

WINDSOR — While Loveland coaches shuffled through some injuries and illness to put together strong relays and produced second-place team finishes for the boys and girls at the meet, Marcus Quere was having none of it.

The Loveland senior won both the 1,600 and 800 meters at the event, setting meet records in the process. He covered the 800 in 2:00.07, the 1,600 in 4:36.06.

"We had about five or six sick kids, so we were shuffling some things around," LHS coach Paul Quere said. "Marcus obviously had a really good meet, winning two tough races and setting meet records against some pretty decent competition.

"We had some kids step in and do a really good things, so it was definitely a step in the right direction.

Marcus wasn't the only Indian finding the top step on the podium as the Loveland girls put together a pair of winning relays, the 400 and 3,200. Hannah Weinmaster, Blair Bernhardt, Rae McCloughan and Sara Jones took care of the shorter event; Kristina Ritschard, Ashlyn Brent, Courtney Bale adn Madeline Kelster the longer. Brent also went on to win the 800 (2:29.86), while McCloughan had a pair of top-three individual finishes, Josie Eder and Weinmaster one each.

The boys 800 relay team took second, while Treven Long was third twice, both in the 100 and 200 sprints. Kyle Brinkman and Zach Jones also had third-place finishes.

Berthoud was also at the meet and came away with a meet record, as Josie Spitz set a new standard in the girls pole vault at 11-1. Alyssa Strong won the 100 hurdles and placed second in the triple jump, with coach Colby Schultz adding that freshman Sophie Visger continues to excel in the high jump and sprint events.

"I expected Josie and Alyssa to exceed my expectations, but the great surprise for me today was freshman Sophie Visger in the high jump and her leg of the sprint medley," Schultz said. "The last two weeks Sophie has me thinking she could be the next Cheyenne Hall (currently running for CSU) for BHS. Good things sometimes come in small packages."

He also felt the freshmen additions for the boys are starting to bolster the relays, still led by Michael Woodiel.

Harrison Panther Invitational

COLORADO SPRINGS — Mountain View continues to prove why its a legitimate state title contender for both the boys and the girls with wins for each team Saturday. The boys won comfortably with 131 points, while the girls were closer but still dominant at a mark of 95.

"We had great conditions to go out and compete and you can't ask for much more than that," MVHS coach Kevin Clark said. "I think overall, we're not there (at state title level) yet, but it was good for establishing confidence and at a 24-plus team meet and to walk away with both team titles was pretty nice.

"Plain Creek is as good as it gets at 5A in relays and we were able to get some. I think that was probably more of the focus today, to show our strength in the relays."

On the girls' side, the 3,200 relay team of Rachel Franklin, Kate Benner, Caroline Foster and Abby Stewart won with a 10.28.02, and the 800 relay of Yasmine Hernandez, Sammi Watson, Kellie Benner and Joscelyn Wind took first in 1:47.67. Sophomore Lauren Offerman and senior Riley Cooney each won individually in the 800 (2:21.90) and 1,600 (5:11.56).
