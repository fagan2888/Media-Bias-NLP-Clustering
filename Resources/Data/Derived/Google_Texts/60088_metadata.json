Both steps\u2014in the direction of everyone and everywhere\u2014hint at the larger ways in which the ephemeral photo sharing service is evolving. Perhaps to keep up with apps like Instagram that allow users to add the location of photos, Snapchat has launched a new filter system for users in New York and Los Angeles. Depending on which neighborhood you're in, you can unlock different possible filters\u2014some of which seem downright ad-like. Waiting in line at Disneyland? Why not take a snap, swipe to the right, and add the Disney-themed art to your creation?\n\nAt the same time, Snapchat is expanding uses for \u2018Our Story,\u2019 a collective snap-narrative created by users in one location but viewable by people everywhere. The new feature, first tested on a smaller scale at the Electric Daisy Carnival this past June, allows complete strangers to share moments from a shared popular event by adding snaps to the same story. (Snapchat launched this cooperative project to appeal, too, to users who can\u2019t attend these events, but still want to experience the action.) A recent high-profile test case came from the final match of the FIFA World Cup, at the game between Germany and Argentina. When viewing Snapchat stories, users had the option of opening \u201cRio Live,\u201d a global story that included selfies from beautiful women on Brazil\u2019s beaches, videos of screaming fans, and scenes from inside the arena. (Whereas past updates have required users to opt-in, Our Story automatically appeared on phones.) In one snap, fans taunt Argentinian star player Lionel Messi following his loss as he broods up a staircase and exits the stadium. Over 200 seconds of stories were added to the Our Story feed, including a snap of Lebron James sitting in the crowd, listening to his Beats headphones. From Snapchat\u2019s perspective, it seemed, there was a natural narrative to be woven by users who were all congregated in one place. Why not give them a tool that would help bring them together through Snaps as well as physical proximity? This wasn\u2019t how Snapchat users saw it. The lack of choice in adding Rio Live immediately caused contention. As more and more snaps appeared in the story, people wondered how Rio Live ended up on their phone in the first place. They felt vulnerable: Why do I have \"riolive2014\" on snapchat? I don't remember adding him... \ud83d\ude30 \u2014 Akash (@OfficialAkash) July 13, 2014 Many expressed sentiments of bemusement or outright anger: I DO NOT CARE ABOUT RIO LIVE. GET OFF MY SNAPCHAT STORY! \u2014 Emily Webster (@emmaleetayla_xo) July 13, 2014 Understandably, fans of Argentina didn't necessarily adore the automatic updates of the crowd belting \"Ol\u00e9\" after the win, which could explain some of the backlash. But the tweets hint at the larger questions which users have about the new direction in which Snapchat\u2014once known for the sense of exclusivity and coziness it created among users\u2014is headed. It's clear that Our Story, which automatically gives users access to a worldwide audience, has upset the community of Snapchatters.", "article_metadata": {"description": "As Snapchat adds location features, is it becoming less Snapchatlike?", "author": "Elliot Williams", "og": {"site_name": "The Atlantic", "description": "As Snapchat adds location features, is it becoming less Snapchatlike?", "title": "Why Snapchat Cares Where You Are", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2014/07/snapsnap/lead_large.jpg", "url": "http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/07/why-snapchat-cares-where-you-are/374733/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "theatlantic.com", "site": "@theatlantic", "card": "summary"}, "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "p": {"domain_verify": "68e1a0361a557708fefc992f3309ed70"}, "fb": {"admins": "577048155,17301937", "page_id": 29259828486, "app_id": 100770816677686}, "keywords": "The Atlantic, The Atlantic Magazine, TheAtlantic.com, Atlantic, news, opinion, breaking news, analysis, commentary, business, politics, culture, international, science, technology, national and life", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, width=device-width, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdbf0c\"", "article_summary": "This wasn\u2019t how Snapchat users saw it.\nThe lack of choice in adding Rio Live immediately caused contention.\n(Snapchat launched this cooperative project to appeal, too, to users who can\u2019t attend these events, but still want to experience the action.)\nIn one snap, fans taunt Argentinian star player Lionel Messi following his loss as he broods up a staircase and exits the stadium.\nAt the same time, Snapchat is expanding uses for \u2018Our Story,\u2019 a collective snap-narrative created by users in one location but viewable by people everywhere."}
