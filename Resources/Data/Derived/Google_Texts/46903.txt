A fast-driving teen smashed his car into a parked police vehicle late Saturday night in a west Wichita mall parking lot.

Wichita police said officers were working a hit and run accident at just after 11 p.m. in the parking lot of Towne West Square when a silver Dodge Stratus sped through the parking lot and slammed into one of the police vehicles.

The 19-year-old driver of the car was taken to a hospital and treated for minor injuries. No officers were hurt.

The investigation is ongoing.
