Starting sometime in the next few months, women in California and Oregon will be able to obtain hormonal contraceptives such as pills, patches, and rings by getting a prescription directly from the pharmacist who dispenses them, a more convenient and potentially less expensive option than going to the doctor. Pharmacists will be authorized to prescribe contraceptives after a quick screening process in which women fill out a questionnaire about their health and medical histories. The contraceptives will be covered by insurance, as they are now. The laws are the latest effort to make birth control more accessible, a longstanding goal of medical professionals and policy makers. But unlike other recent debates over contraception\u2014including the Obama administration's requirement under the Affordable Care Act that all health plans pay for contraceptives\u2014these legislative efforts have been largely free of political controversy. Many reproductive health experts have come to support pharmacist-prescribed contraceptives, persuaded that pharmacists can safely dispense contraception without a doctor's prescription and that women can assess their health risks on questionnaires.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "American Pharmacists Association", "description": "Public health advocates are hoping new laws in two Western states allowing women to obtain contraceptives from pharmacists without a doctor's prescription will spread across the country, as states", "title": "States lead effort to let pharmacists prescribe birth control", "url": "https://www.pharmacist.com/states-lead-effort-let-pharmacists-prescribe-birth-control", "image": "/sites/default/files/images/APhA-footer-logo.png", "updated_time": "2015-11-23T09:00:01-05:00", "type": "article"}, "article": {"published_time": "2015-11-23T09:00:01-05:00", "modified_time": "2015-11-23T09:00:01-05:00"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "Public health advocates are hoping new laws in two Western states allowing women to obtain contraceptives from pharmacists without a doctor's prescription will spread across the country, as states", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "The laws are the latest effort to make birth control more accessible, a longstanding goal of medical professionals and policy makers.\nPublic health advocates are hoping new laws in two Western states allowing women to obtain contraceptives from pharmacists without a doctor's prescription will spread across the country, as states deal with persistently high rates of unintended pregnancy.\nPharmacists will be authorized to prescribe contraceptives after a quick screening process in which women fill out a questionnaire about their health and medical histories.\nMany reproductive health experts have come to support pharmacist-prescribed contraceptives, persuaded that pharmacists can safely dispense contraception without a doctor's prescription and that women can assess their health risks on questionnaires.\nThe contraceptives will be covered by insurance, as they are now."}
