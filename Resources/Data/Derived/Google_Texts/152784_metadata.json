Mark Meadows (R-N.C), chairman of the Government Operations panel of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee.\n\nNational Taxpayer Advocate Nina Olson agreed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never seen such low levels of taxpayer service. It\u2019s officially the worst since 2001,\u201d she said.\n\nAcross Capitol Hill in Senate chambers, IRS Commissioner John Koskinen defended the agency against Republicans who blamed it for problems the government has had in implementing the tax-related requirements of the Affordable Care Act. This is the first year that Americans have had to state on their tax returns whether they\u2019ve purchased health insurance.\n\nHouse approves bills to \u201crein in IRS abuse\u201d\n\nThe majority of bills approved by the House would \u201crein in IRS abuse,\u201d according to Rep. Peter Roskam (R-Ill.), chairman of Ways and Means\u2019 Subcommittee on Oversight.\n\nOne bill would codify the \u201cTaxpayer\u2019s Bill of Rights,\u201d a policy that the IRS adopted last summer after years of advocacy by Olson.\n\nOther measures are more controversial and, largely, inspired by the recent scandal caused by allegations of targeting of conservative groups by the IRS\u2019 tax-exempt division.\n\nOne bill clarifies that IRS employees could lose their jobs if they abused their positions for either personal or political reasons.\n\n\u201cWhen the American people learned nearly two years ago that the IRS targeted political groups for extra scrutiny, they were outraged \u2014 and rightly so. There is no room for political targeting in our democracy,\u201d said Rep. Jim Renacci (R-Ohio), the bill\u2019s sponsor.\n\nSeparately, the House passed a bill to require contractors to show proof that employees assigned to larger projects did not owe taxes. It rejected a similar bill aimed at preventing people who owe back taxes from working for the government. Approximately 100,000 federal employees who have tax debts could have lost their jobs. Federal labor unions had lobbied hard against the legislation.\n\nOlson ties bad customer service to budgets and lack of innovation\n\nThe IRS had warned that it would give poor service to customers this year because of budget cuts. It was right.\n\nCall center representatives answered only 37 percent of taxpayer calls from Jan. 1 to April 13, Olson said. Callers waited on hold 24 minutes on average before talking with the representatives, she said. Those statistics are nearly twice as bad as last year. And it\u2019s going to get worse after today.\n\n\u201cThe IRS is only answering the most basic of tax-law questions through April 15 and none after that date,\u201d she said. \u201cLet me be clear: If you call tomorrow, April 16, you will not get answers to any tax-law questions from the IRS.\u201d\n\nThe quality of customer service at IRS walk-in centers and through the mail also has plummeted, she said.\n\nThe IRS has blamed the decline on consecutive years of budget cuts, with a corresponding loss of 12,000 employees since fiscal 2010. Olson told House members she agreed, for the most part.\n\n\u201cThere is no answer to the taxpayer-service side of the equation except more funding, even as we move into electronic taxpayer accounts and things like that,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen the IRS is proposing to do things to you, you want to talk with someone to make sure they got your information and understand what you\u2019re saying.\u201d\n\nWhile the IRS has lost money, it has gained new responsibilities through recent laws, including the Affordable Care Act, she said. But in addition to money, the agency suffers from a lack of creativity, particularly when it comes to combating the growing problem of tax-related identity theft, she said.\n\n\u201cOn the enforcement side, I believe they can do better with their procedures. They are not bringing in the innovation \u2014 the young folks who would say, \u2018Let\u2019s look at it a different way and take a different approach,'\u201d she said.\n\nHalf of the IRS\u2019 workforce is over the age of 50. The number of employees under the age of 30 is declining, suggesting that the IRS is becoming less attractive as an employer, said Rep. Gerry Connolly (D-Va.), who supports greater funding for the agency.\n\nOlson agreed, but cautioned that Congress should attach strings to any increase in the IRS\u2019 budget.\n\n\u201cI would also suggest setting goals for the IRS and holding them accountable, saying, \u2018How are you going to achieve them if we give you this money,\u201d she said.\n\nRELATED STORIES:\n\nHouse leaders use Tax Day to pass bills to \u2018rein in the IRS\u2019\n\nHouse puts 100,000 tax-delinquent feds on notice\n\nNTEU to Congress: You can\u2019t starve the IRS", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "application-name": "FederalNewsRadio.com", "wp-parsely_version": "1.7", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://federalnewsradio.com/wp-content/themes/wfed/assets/img/favicons/mstile-310x150.png", "sailthru.date": "2015-04-15 06:21:12", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://federalnewsradio.com/wp-content/themes/wfed/assets/img/favicons/mstile-70x70.png", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://federalnewsradio.com/wp-content/themes/wfed/assets/img/favicons/mstile-310x310.png", "og": {"site_name": "FederalNewsRadio.com", "description": "Internal Revenue Service faced a tough day on Capitol Hill Wednesday, with a spate of new bills passed and IRS Commissioner John Koskinen testifying before Congress.", "title": "Taxpayer advocate slams IRS service as 'officially worst' since 2001", "locale": "en_US", "updated_time": "2015-04-16T06:53:52+00:00", "url": "http://federalnewsradio.com/budget/2015/04/taxpayer-advocate-slams-irs-service-as-officially-worst-since-2001/", "type": "article"}, "sailthru.canonical": "http://federalnewsradio.com/budget/2015/04/taxpayer-advocate-slams-irs-service-as-officially-worst-since-2001/", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://federalnewsradio.com/wp-content/plugins/sailthru-custom/assets/img/wtop50x50.jpg", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://federalnewsradio.com/wp-content/themes/wfed/assets/img/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "article": {"section": "All News", "published_time": "2015-04-15T18:21:12+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-04-16T06:53:52+00:00"}, "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://federalnewsradio.com/wp-content/themes/wfed/assets/img/favicons/mstile-150x150.png", "sailthru.image.full": "http://federalnewsradio.com/wp-content/plugins/sailthru-custom/assets/img/wtop50x50.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdefa8\"", "article_summary": "Advertisement\u201cI\u2019ve never seen such low levels of taxpayer service.\nOne bill clarifies that IRS employees could lose their jobs if they abused their positions for either personal or political reasons.\nYou couldn\u2019t blame IRS employees if they disliked tax day as much as the rest of us do, especially if they glimpsed C-SPAN on Wednesday.\nHouse approves bills to \u201crein in IRS abuse\u201dThe majority of bills approved by the House would \u201crein in IRS abuse,\u201d according to Rep.
