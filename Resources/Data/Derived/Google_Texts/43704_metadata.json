In her memo, Schlafly points out that many of Rubio\u2019s memorized Gang of Eight talking points were outright falsehoods that seemed fabricated in order to dupe conservatives.\n\nSchlafly writes, \u201cRubio\u2019s entire career rests on the fact that no one will question his syrupy scripted bites and homeroom-president style rehearsed speeches\u201d\n\nDuring Saturday night\u2019s debate, Chris Christie exploited this weakness. Rubio\u2019s televised short-circuit meltdown prompted viewers to label him \u201cMarcobot,\u201d \u201cMarco Robio,\u201d and \u201cRubioBot.\u201d\n\nEven after the debate, Rubio\u2019s programming continued to glitch\u2014including one bizarre moment at a campaign event in Nashua, New Hampshire in which he repeated one of his scripted lines twice\u2014back to back\u2014in full view of the media.\n\nYet underpinning both Schlafly and Christie\u2019s attacks against Rubio was a long-term strategy implemented by Sen. Jeff Sessions focused on the critical issues of trade and immigration.\n\nWhile Rubio has been Congress\u2019s most aggressive champion of open borders trade and immigration policies, Sessions has been Congress\u2019s leading voice of opposition to the donor-class\u2019s globalist agenda.\n\nAt least 92% of the GOP electorate oppose Sen. Rubio\u2019s desire to expand immigration levels, according to Pew polling data. Similarly, by a nearly five-to-one margin, Republican voters believe that so-called free trade deals lower wages rather than raise them.\n\nSessions warned New Hampshire voters: \u201cI don\u2019t think a Republican candidate should be running for President that says they\u2019re for amnesty, for even more immigration, and for trade agreements that don\u2019t serve the national interest,\u201d Sessions declared.\n\nSessions described Rubio\u2019s support for granting citizenship to illegal immigrants as disqualifying, stating: \u201cSupporting citizenship for illegal immigrants should be disqualifying. Just like we can\u2019t have a GOP nominee who supports Obamacare, we can\u2019t have a GOP nominee who supports amnesty. Our priority needs to be helping get unemployed Americans back to work, not replacing them with lower-wage labor from abroad.\u201d\n\nWhile the media has allowed Sen. Rubio to go eight consecutive debates without ever being asked if he stands by his endorsement of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, Sessions has relentlessly pushed candidates to make their positions on the issues that matter to American voters known.\n\nFor instance, on Friday, prior to the ABC debate, Sessions issued a questionnaire for candidates\u2014consisting of five straightforward questions related to immigration, trade and crime\u2014so that voters could know where their candidates stand on these critical issues.\n\nUnder normal political rules, following his dismal performance in New Hampshire, Rubio\u2019s candidacy would seem purely ceremonial at this point. In the last 40 years, no candidate has won the Republican Party nomination without winning Iowa or New Hampshire.\n\nYet Rubio not only failed to win either state, but he trailed in third place in Iowa and fifth place in New Hampshire.\n\nBy contrast, in 2012 Mitt Romney finished in 2nd place in Iowa and 1st place in New Hampshire. In 2008, John McCain finished 4th in Iowa, but 1st in New Hampshire. In 2000, George W. Bush finished 1st in Iowa and 2nd in New Hampshire. In 1996, Bob Dole finished 1st in Iowa and 2nd in New Hampshire. In 1988, George H.W. Bush finished 3rd in Iowa and 1st in New Hampshire.\n\nAs Vox recently noted, \u201cIn the past 60 years, no eventual nominee finished worse than second in New Hampshire. (Note: Two weren\u2019t in the race when the New Hampshire primary happened \u2014 Hubert Humphrey in 1968 and Estes Kefauver in 1952.) That means that, much like the Iowa caucuses, New Hampshire is more about who won\u2019t be president than who will.\u201d\n\nHowever, the Party establishment may still be able to resurrect Rubio\u2019s failing campaign. Last night, for example, Fox News\u2019 Megyn Kelly seemed to try to frame Rubio\u2019s disastrous fifth place finish as a \u201cnail-biter\u201d race to third:\n\nIt has been an all-out nail-biter between @tedcruz, @JebBush and @marcorubio to figure out who\u2019s placing in the third position. #NHPrimary \u2014 Megyn Kelly (@megynkelly) February 10, 2016\n\nIndeed, given Rubio\u2019s enormous backing from the Party establishment and the donor-class, the normal political rules do not seem to apply to Sen. Rubio.\n\nFor instance, Sen. Rubio\u2019s signature legislative accomplishment in the Senate was partnering with Barack Obama to develop an immigration agenda opposed by an overwhelming majority of the Republican electorate. Rubio continues to hold a view on immigration that is opposed by at least 92% of the GOP electorate.\n\nUnder normal political rules, it may perhaps be hard to envision such a candidate being considered for the position of the Party\u2019s nominee. For instance, it is hard to imagine the Democratic Party selecting as its nominee a candidate who campaigns on wanting to repeal Obamacare or aggressively opposes some other core tenet of the Party\u2019s progressive base.\n\nThe establishment\u2019s effort to buoy Rubio\u2019s candidacy perhaps demonstrates the extent to which the Republican Party\u2019s leadership is donor-driven rather than voter-driven. While Democrat donors represent the interests of their base, Republican donors seem to actively undermine the interests of their base.\n\nFor instance, while the media has highlighted the similarities between Rubio and Obama, there is a key difference between the two which often goes undiscussed. Namely, while Obama represented the core views of his base, Rubio represents the interests of his Party\u2019s donor base, not its voter base.\n\nThe Republican Party\u2019s allegiance to championing its donors\u2019 interests\u2013which, in many instances, seem to directly contradict the interests of its voters\u2013may perhaps explain the results of last night\u2019s exit polls. Specifically, the exit polling data showed that while only about one in seven Democrats feel \u201cbetrayed\u201d by their party, half of Republican voters feel \u201cbetrayed\u201d by theirs.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether the Party\u2019s elites and establishment media will be able to resurrect Sen. Rubio\u2019s candidacy. However, as Nate Silver has previously observed, the Party establishment\u2019s candidate may be the beneficiary of \u201ca lot of second and third chances\u201d because the Party holds the \u201cpower to set the rules of engagement and strategically encourage winnowing of the field.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Phyllis Schlafly, Chris Christie, Jeff Sessions Deliver Body Blow to Rubio in New Hampshire", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Phyllis Schlafly, Chris Christie, Jeff Sessions Deliver Body Blow to Rubio in New Hampshire", "title": "Phyllis Schlafly, Chris Christie, Jeff Sessions Deliver Body Blow to Rubio in New Hampshire - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2016/02/Marcobot-Wrestle-640x480-1.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/immigration/2016/02/10/phyllis-schlafly-chris-christie-jeff-sessions-deliver-body-blow-rubio-new-hampshire/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Phyllis Schlafly, Chris Christie, Jeff Sessions Deliver Body Blow to Rubio in New Hampshire", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2016/02/Marcobot-Wrestle-640x480-1.jpg", "title": "Phyllis Schlafly, Chris Christie, Jeff Sessions Deliver Body Blow to Rubio in New Hampshire - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Jeb Bush, Jeff Sessions, John McCain, Megyn Kelly, Mitt Romney, Nate Silver,2016 Presidential Race, Immigration,Marco Rubio", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "2016 Presidential Race", "tag": "Nate Silver", "published_time": "2016-02-10T12:15:53-07:00", "categories": "Immigration,2016 Presidential Race"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "Under normal political rules, following his dismal performance in New Hampshire, Rubio\u2019s candidacy would seem purely ceremonial at this point.\nAt least 92% of the GOP electorate oppose Sen.
