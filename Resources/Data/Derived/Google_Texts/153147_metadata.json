The ratings seek to measure how easily a firm\u2019s funds would trade on the secondary market based on the number of the site\u2019s 1,750 users who indicate interest in the specific manager, among certain other factors, including the quality of prospective buyers. The users include institutional investors, managers and industry participants.\n\nSetter, which launched its liquidity rating system last year, rates fund managers as \u201cgood,\u201d \u201cvery good\u201d or \u201cexcellent.\u201d The top-rated midmarket firms under Setter\u2019s system are Abry and H.I.G., the only two firms to receive \u201cexcellent\u201d ratings. Audax Private Equity, Charlesbank Capital Partners and Endeavour Capital are among the firms that earned a \u201cvery good\u201d rating, while firms that received \u201cgood\u201d ratings include Marlin Equity Partners, RoundTable Health Care Partners and Vista Equity Partners.\n\nAlthough the system only rates managers and not their individual funds, it highlights the power that larger, better recognized firms can command on the secondary market. Such firms often have a broader base of limited partners, increasing the likelihood that stakes in their funds will come up for sale.\n\nPeter McGrath, co-founder of Setter says that he believes the ratings also provide a good indicator of how investor appetite may shape up for firms when they seek capital for new funds. Interest in midmarket buyout funds has expanded significantly in recent years.\n\nBut some secondary buyers say that some of the 150 midmarket buyout firms that have not received any rating from Setter could also offer a potentially attractive buying opportunity.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s less competitive for those opportunities,\u201d said John Kettnich, a principal on the secondary team at StepStone Group. \u201cIf you can find a group that\u2019s less competitive for reasons other than GP quality, then you might be able to take advantage of inefficiencies in the market and identify an overlooked gem.\u201d\n\nPrivate Equity Beat readers, where do you stand? How closely do you think demand on the secondary market correlates to an ability to raise new capital? Which middle market buyout firms would be on your \u201cmust have\u201d list?\n\nWrite to Laura Kreutzer at laura.kreutzer@wsj.com.
