On Wednesday, an inspection by Minnesota State Patrol found 16 of 20 Proctor School District buses unfit for safe transportation. The buses were taken out of service after violating numerous mechanical and safety standards.

The violations included leaking fluids, missing brake pads, inoperative emergency exits, defective brake components and "sharp or hazardous" objects. Three drivers were also cited and fined for a pre-trip violation.

According to Minnesota State Patrol, bus drivers are required to do an inspection prior to operating each day. No pre-trip inspection had been done since January. State Patrol does bus checks for school districts annually but also conducts audits and inspections at random. They say it is now the carrier's responsibility to rectify these violations before the buses can be used again.

Proctor School District Superintendent John Engelking provided this statement to Eyewitness News saying, "...I am disappointed that we received numerous infractions in high patrol inspection, however, the infractions were not critical bus maintenance issues and we will have the repairs completed by next week."

He also says the school district will be bringing new rounds of training to their transportation department by early April. As of now, six of the violated buses have been fixed. The superintendent says he will use next week's spring break to fix all of the buses.

State patrol says they will return in two weeks to make sure the buses were repaired properly.
