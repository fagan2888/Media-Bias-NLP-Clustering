Donald Trump remains the GOP front-runner in Oklahoma, but it now appears to be a two-way race in our state’s Republican primary, according to an exclusive News 9/News On 6 poll.

Trump, with 35 percent of the likely vote, leads a surging Ted Cruz, who received 25 percent in the poll. Cruz had 7 percent in September.

Two other prominent GOP candidates have lost support since November.

Ben Carson’s support fell 10 points since November to eight percent in January. Marco Rubio fell eight points and is currently at 10 percent, according to the tracking polls.

Trump has topped all three polls conducted by the polling firm hired by News 9/News On 6. The polls target “likely voters,” who are expected to show up on Election Day and are the true measure of the electorate.

Meanwhile, Hillary Clinton leads Bernie Sanders by 25 points among Democrat voters, according to the poll. Clinton (41 percent) has seen her lead narrow 10 points over Sanders (16 percent) since November.

More than a third of Democrat voters are still undecided, according to the poll.

Oklahoma’s primary election is March 1st. News 9 and News On 6 will be tracking the presidential races all the way through Election Day.
