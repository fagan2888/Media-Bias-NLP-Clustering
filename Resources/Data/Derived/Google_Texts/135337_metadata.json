Anna Burger, another COS leader, was secretary-treasurer of Service Employees International Union when COS launched in 2006.\n\n\u201cCommittee on States membership in 2014 consists of 21 national donors and institutional partners,\u201d the COS memo said, without specifying how many of its institutional partners are labor unions. COS follows the Democracy Alliance model of recommending donors to left-wing groups instead of distributing donations itself.\n\nIn addition to AFL-CIO, NEA, SEIU and AFSCME, Democracy Alliance works closely with American Federation of Teachers, the only AFL-CIO affiliate larger than AFSCME. NEA and AFT are both public-sector unions, and many of SEIU\u2019s 1.8 million members are government workers.\n\n\u201cTogether we are building a progressive future, one that is sustainable, state-focused and dedicated to winning electoral and policy victories,\u201d the COS memo published by the Free Beacon concluded.\n\nThe public union business model hinges on unsustainable government spending. This is why NEA, SEIU, AFT, AFSCME and AFL-CIO savage prominent limited-government advocates Charles and David Koch in an attempt to discredit causes the billionaire brothers support.\n\nWith that in mind, who is behind the Democracy Alliance project helping union bosses prop up \u201cprogressive\u201d groups? In addition to Stocks and Burger, leaders of COS include:\n\nRob Stein, Democracy Alliance founder, former Democratic National Committee adviser, and chief of staff for President Clinton\u2019s 1992 transition team\n\nMichael Vachon, an adviser to and personal spokesman for left-wing hedge fund billionaire George Soros, whose net worth is approximately $24 billion\n\nPat Stryker, a Stryker Corporation heiress whose net worth is an estimated $2.1 billion\n\nAnne Bartley, wife of SEIU executive Larry McNeil and an heiress to the Rockefeller family fortune\n\nAlida Messinger, ex-wife of Minnesota Gov. Mark Dayton and also a Rockefeller heiress\n\nRob McKay, son of the founder of Taco Bell\n\nLynde Uihlein, an heiress to the Schlitz Brewing Co. and Allen-Bradley Co. fortunes\n\nJohn Hunting, whose father was a founder of Steelcase, Inc. and who said in a 2010 interview, \u201cI believe that it is immoral to hoard money when global warming is on the verge of destroying the eco-systems we depend on.\u201d\n\nDouglas Phelps, president of U.S. Public Interest Research Group and Environment America and advisory board chairman of leftist charity Fund for the Public Interest\n\nColorado lobbyist Ted Trimpa and former Colorado State University president Al Yates, who worked with Stryker and other wealthy donors to develop \u201cThe Colorado Model,\u201d on which COS is based\n\nNEA, AFSCME and AFL-CIO failed to respond to requests for comment on how the activities of COS are different from or preferable to the work of union-maligned donors to free-market groups.\n\nAn appendix to the Oct. 21 COS memo listed investments by COS partners as shown in the following table, noting most state figures \u201cinclude large contributions by our labor union allies.\u201d\n\nState Estimated 2013/14 Investment Arizona $2 million California $3.5 million Colorado $6 million + Florida $6 million + Idaho $900,000 Maine $1.25 million Massachusetts $200,000 Michigan $1 million Minnesota $7 million Nebraska $250,000 New Mexico $3.4 million North Carolina $7 million Ohio $1 million Oregon $250,000 Pennsylvania $2 million Texas $2 million Utah $200,000 Washington $1.3 million Wisconsin $9 million Wyoming $250,000\n\nCOS indicated \u201cdonor alliances\u201d are being coordinated in Georgia, New Hampshire and Montana, as well.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Committee on States, a project of the secretive Democracy Alliance, is helping labor unions coordinate advocacy for bigger government in 20 states.", "og": {"site_name": "Watchdog.org", "description": "Committee on States, a project of the secretive Democracy Alliance, is helping labor unions coordinate advocacy for bigger government in 20 states.", "title": "Wealthy leftists help unions bankroll 'progressive' groups - Watchdog.org", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2014/11/john-stocks-nea-youtube-300px.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-12-19T11:22:25+00:00", "url": "http://watchdog.org/183394/wealthy-progressive-groups/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Watchdog.org", "description": "Committee on States, a project of the secretive Democracy Alliance, is helping labor unions coordinate advocacy for bigger government in 20 states.", "title": "Wealthy leftists help unions bankroll 'progressive' groups - Watchdog.org", "image": {"src": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2014/11/john-stocks-nea-youtube-300px.jpg"}, "creator": "@jasonahart", "site": "@watchdogorg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noarchive", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Watchdogorg", "section": "Labor", "tag": "Politics & Elections 1", "published_time": "2014-11-19T08:34:28+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-12-19T11:22:25+00:00"}, "news_keywords": "Committee on States, Democracy Alliance, John Stocks, NEA, National Education Association, AFL-CIO, AFSCME, SEIU, Anna Burger"}, "article_summary": "With that in mind, who is behind the Democracy Alliance project helping union bosses prop up \u201cprogressive\u201d groups?\nCOS follows the Democracy Alliance model of recommending donors to left-wing groups instead of distributing donations itself.\nBy Jason Hart | Watchdog.orgCommittee on States, a project of the secretive Democracy Alliance, is helping labor unions and leftist millionaires coordinate advocacy for big government in 20 states.\nThe public union business model hinges on unsustainable government spending.\nIn addition to AFL-CIO, NEA, SEIU and AFSCME, Democracy Alliance works closely with American Federation of Teachers, the only AFL-CIO affiliate larger than AFSCME."}
