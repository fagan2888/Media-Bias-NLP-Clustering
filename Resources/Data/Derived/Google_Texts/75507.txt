The phone was on the island in the kitchen, so Patrick Jr. got his stool so he could reach it.

"Patrick and I were working on a project in his room and we needed some pliers," his father, Patrick Roberts Sr. said.

Soon to be three-year-old Patrick Roberts was presented an Everyday Hero Award.

Sometimes our kids surprise us with how calm they can be and how well they respond in adverse situations. One boy, not yet three, got an award from EMSA Monday for staying calm and helping when his dad needed an ambulance.

Soon to be three-year-old Patrick Roberts was presented an Everyday Hero Award from EMSA paramedic Vicki Lane Monday, as well as a Superman action figure, for remaining calm and cool when his dad fell and broke his leg.

"Patrick and I were working on a project in his room and we needed some pliers," his father, Patrick Roberts Sr. said.

The pliers were outside and as he headed out the back door he took a wrong step.

"My foot rolled and I heard a snap," he said.

He had dislocated his ankle and broken his leg. He needed his phone to call for help and he needed his son's help to get it.

"I need my phone because I need to call Mommy and I need to call an ambulance," he said.

The phone was on the island in the kitchen, so Patrick Jr. got his stool so he could reach it.

"I don't know how long it took for everyone to get there, but he stayed with me, sang songs with me," Patrick Sr. said. "I'm sure we sang Baa, Baa Black Sheep, and Where in the World is The Pokey Little Puppy."

Sometimes, our children, no matter how young, will often exceed our expectations and do super things, even heroic things, when confronted with the necessity.
