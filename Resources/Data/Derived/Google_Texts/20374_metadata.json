Ron Johnson, R-Wis., the chairman of the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, who, along with other Senate leaders, asked the GAO to review the Obama administration\u2019s response to the unaccompanied minor crisis.\n\n\u201cPeople have said the crisis is over, but it only doesn\u2019t seem like a crisis because we have gotten more efficient at apprehending, processing, and dispersing the children\u2014and then ignoring them,\u201d Johnson told The Daily Signal.\n\nThe William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2008 provides protection for children entering the U.S. alone who are not from Mexico or Canada by prohibiting them from being quickly sent back to their home countries.\n\nInstead, the Office of Refugee Resettlement, an agency of the Department of Health and Human Services, provides shelter for unaccompanied children from Central America and finds sponsors to care for them while they await hearings in immigration courts.\n\nAccording to the GAO report released Monday, the Office of Refugee Resettlement had been used to caring for a steady number of children for a number of years. From fiscal years 2003 through 2011, the agency cared for less than 10,000 unaccompanied children per year.\n\nBeginning in fiscal year 2012, the number of unaccompanied children apprehended at the southwest border by the Department of Homeland Security and transferred to the Office of Refugee Resettlement rose dramatically, peaking in fiscal year 2014 at nearly 57,500.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Senate Judiciary Committee will hear testimony from Obama administration officials as lawmakers seek to find more answers about the unaccompanied children crisis.\n\nJohnson, who is not on the committee, believes that the response to the crisis should start at the beginning and be focused on deterring illegal immigration to the U.S.\n\nHe argues that the U.S. government\u2019s responsibility to shelter and provide a hearing to unaccompanied children from Central America has incentivized immigrants to take the dangerous journey here.\n\nHe also says President Barack Obama\u2019s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, known as DACA, encourages children to come to the U.S.\n\nWhile recent border crossers are not eligible for the program, Johnson thinks it sends the message that the U.S. government will provide refuge to children who come here illegally, no matter if they qualify for protection under U.S. law.\n\n\u201cRather than adding more beds and facilities and getting more efficient at apprehending and dispersing the children, we\u2019ve got to look at these policies and see what\u2019s incentivizing the children to come here,\u201d Johnson said.\n\nMelysa Sperber, the director of the Alliance to End Slavery and Trafficking, agrees that the U.S. government needs to slow down the flight from Central America.\n\nBut she says the fix is closer to home.\n\n\u201cWe really believe it is a humanitarian crisis, and rather than helping Mexico install tighter border controls to interdict women and children fleeing violence, the U.S. government should be focused on the root causes of the crisis and invest in stronger child protection systems, and strengthen the rule of law, to reduce impunity in Central America,\u201d Sperber told The Daily Signal.\n\nOfficials from the refugee resettlement agency have acknowledged they were overwhelmed in 2014 but have since upped their capacity to shelter the children. The federal government has increased the number of nonprofit groups that it pays to operate shelters for the children and locate sponsors from 27 such organizations that ran 59 facilities to 57 that are managing 140 facilities.\n\n\u201cThis may be a system that worked reasonably well with a steady population, but in the last two years, as things peaked very quickly and the systems were under strain with the unanticipated sharp changes, that\u2019s when things started to crack,\u201d said Doris Meissner, who leads the U.S. Immigration Policy Program at the Migration Policy Institute.\n\nIn the haste to keep up with the numbers, the Office of Refugee Resettlement has undertaken policy changes, such as forgoing fingerprinting as a component of background checks for sponsors who are parents or legal guardians with no criminal or child abuse history.\n\nOn Jan. 28, the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations issued a report showing that the refugee resettlement agency sometimes fails to verify the relationship between an unrelated adult sponsor and unaccompanied child. Indeed, the refugee resettlement agency stopped requiring original copies of birth certificates to prove most sponsors\u2019 identities.\n\nSince the rule changes, children were released to sponsors who subjected them to sexual abuse, labor trafficking, or neglect.\n\nThe more recent GAO report traces the problems with caring for the refugees earlier in the process. Office of Refugee Resettlement officials say that, because of a lack of resources, the agency has gone years without visiting and monitoring some of the nonprofit-run facilities that shelter the children before they are released to sponsors.\n\nIn the rare instances where refugee resettlement officials do personally visit the facilities, they can find problems. According to a report reviewed by the GAO, Refugee Resettlement officials found that one facility failed to medicate children properly, which, in one instance, led to accidental overdoses of medicine.\n\nIn addition, while the shelters are required to provide medical and mental health services to children who need them, and education to all, the GAO found that children\u2019s case files were often incomplete, making it difficult for investigators to determine whether they had received the care they needed.\n\nMeanwhile, later in the process, the Office of Refugee Resettlement does not often visit the homes of sponsors who end up claiming responsibility for the kids.\n\nBy law, the refugee resettlement agency is only obligated to do home visits of sponsors in certain circumstances, such as when the person is a non-relative, and when the child is younger than 12 or a victim of trafficking or other abuse.\n\n\u201cObviously these abuses are terrible, and nobody would want this to be happening, but I think in looking at this, one of the issues that\u2019s important to untangle is what ORR\u2019s actual obligations are supposed to be,\u201d said Meissner, who argued that state and local governments need to take on more responsibility for supervising the children.\n\nThe Office of Refugee Resettlement recently took steps to expand the services it provides to children after they are released to sponsors, including creating a National Call Center for children who experience \u201cdisruption\u201d in the custody of their sponsors.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Two recent investigations fault the U.S. government for its handling of the unaccompanied minor immigration crisis of 2014.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Two recent investigations fault the U.S. government for its handling of the unaccompanied minor immigration crisis of 2014.", "title": "The Unaccompanied Minor Immigration Crisis Never Ended", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/unaccompaniedminor.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-22T20:59:59+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1QunnZi"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Two recent investigations fault the U.S. government for its handling of the unaccompanied minor immigration crisis of 2014.", "creator": "@dailysignal", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/unaccompaniedminor.jpg"}, "title": "The Unaccompanied Minor Immigration Crisis Never Ended", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Society", "tag": "immigration", "published_time": "2016-02-22T17:39:59+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-22T20:59:59+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "unaccompanied minor, Central America, border crisis, Office of Refugee Resettlement, HHS, Ron Johnson, DHS, Obama, Senate Judiciary Committee"}, "article_summary": "On Tuesday, the Senate Judiciary Committee will hear testimony from Obama administration officials as lawmakers seek to find more answers about the unaccompanied children crisis.\nThe crisis of unaccompanied Central American children illegally crossing the United States\u2019 southern border does not end when they enter this country.\nFrom fiscal years 2003 through 2011, the agency cared for less than 10,000 unaccompanied children per year.\nIn the rare instances where refugee resettlement officials do personally visit the facilities, they can find problems.\nIndeed, the refugee resettlement agency stopped requiring original copies of birth certificates to prove most sponsors\u2019 identities."}
