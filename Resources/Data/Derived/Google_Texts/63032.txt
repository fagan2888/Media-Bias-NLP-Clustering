The Washington Wizards scored just six fourth-quarter points as they let a lead disappear in a loss to the Charlotte Hornets on Nov. 25.

They didn’t want it to happen again.

John Wall had 27 points and 12 assists and Garrett Temple scored a career-high 21 points as the Wizards hung on for a 109-101 victory over the Hornets on Saturday night.

Jared Dudley matched a season high with 19 points and Marcin Gortat had 18 points for Washington.

Wall scored 20 points in the first half but admitted to being tired late as he played nearly 42 minutes — eight more than his season average.

Still, he drilled a key jumper with just over two minutes left in the game after Cody Zeller’s layup cut the lead to 99-98 seconds earlier.

That shot bailed out Wall and the Wizards after Wall had eight turnovers, two shy of a career high.

“I got a little tired and then I had some careless turnovers that nearly cost us the game,” Wall said.

Kemba Walker led Charlotte with 18 points, and Jeremy Lin scored 15.
