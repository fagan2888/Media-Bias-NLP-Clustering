Cost control is also part of the picture, but not the dominant part. And what we\u2019re seeing right now, in any case, seems to confirm a point some of us have been making for a long time: controlling costs and expanding access are complementary targets, because you can\u2019t sell things like cost-saving measures for Medicaid and limits on deductibility of premiums unless they\u2019re part of a larger scheme to make the system fairer and more comprehensive. And here\u2019s the thing: Republicans don\u2019t want to help the unfortunate.\u201d\n\nKrugman goes on to denounce the \u201crage of the right\u201d at President Obama\u2019s policies, for just trying to offer help to these poor unfortunate souls. But I think the professor isn\u2019t thinking big enough here. He\u2019s settling for an easy answer to a far more complex problem, perhaps out of deference to his opponents. He\u2019s missing the true villainy of Republicans \u2013 particularly conservatives, and even more particularly religious conservatives \u2013 and how it reveals their vile and antisocial character\u2026 and how they purposefully disguise it in a way that allows them the opportunity to be pompous and judgmental of people like Professor Krugman.\n\nIt\u2019s really devious once you understand it, so I\u2019ll try to explain.\n\nWhat you have to understand about American Republicans is that they are the most misanthropic people on the planet. They don\u2019t just hate the poor. They hate everybody. A tribal people to the core, they assign ill-motives and deal in broad-based evaluations of everyone, even those technically within their own clan for being insufficiently hateful. Just look at the Republican on Republican violence over the Medicaid expansion, and how they react to a few of their fellows breaking ranks to help the unfortunate! You might as well have run over their puppy for how they react (though of course Republicans also hate puppies).\n\nBut here\u2019s why Krugman\u2019s answer is far too easy: because it leaves out the really evil part of what Republicans do. It\u2019s not enough that they loathe the poor and unfortunate and demand fealty to policies designed to make their lives as terrible as possible. It\u2019s that they also want the moral superiority that comes with philanthropic activity! They are quite dedicated to it, too, particularly the Mormons and the Southern Baptists (who, as I\u2019m sure Professor Krugman knows, hate the unfortunate more than any other Republican factions). That\u2019s why states like Utah, Mississippi, Alabama, Tennessee, South Carolina and other red states lead the country in the percentage of household income given to charity, while New England \u2013 where such hatred of the poor is rare, and charitable giving is not required in order to achieve that special warm feeling of superiority \u2013 lags the nation with near Biden-level percentages of charitable donations.\n\nThis organized effort, built on a network of religious fanatics who sing songs together and recite prose in unison in cult-like meetinghouses across the nation, demonstrates the true villainy of the tithing culture and the vacuity of so-called \u201cacts of charity\u201d which exist in Republican communities. Remember: you only care about someone if you\u2019re dedicated to compelling someone else to give money to an effort. The only purpose of giving of your own free will is self-aggrandizement. The only kind of spending which demonstrates actual care for the poor and unfortunate is government spending.\n\nI\u2019m sure Professor Krugman realizes this, so it\u2019s probably just an oversight that he forgot to mention it. His only problem as a columnist is that he\u2019s far too nice.\n\n[Originally published on The Federalist]", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://blog.heartland.org/2013/12/paul-krugman-doesnt-get-the-true-depth-of-conservative-villainy/", "type": "activity", "image": "http://blog.heartland.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Republicans-We-hate-poor-people.jpg", "site_name": "Somewhat Reasonable", "title": "Paul Krugman Doesn\u2019t Get The True Depth Of Conservative Villainy"}, "robots": "noodp,noydir", "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd7e3a\"", "article_summary": "I\u2019m sure Professor Krugman realizes this, so it\u2019s probably just an oversight that he forgot to mention it.\nYou might as well have run over their puppy for how they react (though of course Republicans also hate puppies).\nThey are quite dedicated to it, too, particularly the Mormons and the Southern Baptists (who, as I\u2019m sure Professor Krugman knows, hate the unfortunate more than any other Republican factions).\nThe only kind of spending which demonstrates actual care for the poor and unfortunate is government spending.\nAnd here\u2019s the thing: Republicans don\u2019t want to help the unfortunate.\u201dKrugman goes on to denounce the \u201crage of the right\u201d at President Obama\u2019s policies, for just trying to offer help to these poor unfortunate souls."}
