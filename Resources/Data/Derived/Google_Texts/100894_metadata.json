( GARY KAZANJIAN / The Associated Press )\n\nFORT COLLINS \u2014 For the third time in program history, Colorado State's football team gets to take part in an inaugural bowl game.\n\nIt is the first time, however, their bowl date has been a conference game, too.\n\nThe Rams accepted an invitation Sunday to play in the Nova Home Loans Arizona Bowl on Dec. 29, facing Nevada, also out of the Mountain West at Arizona Stadium (5:30 p.m.).\n\nColorado State also appeared in the first New Orleans Bowl (2001) and the Poinsettia Bowl (2005).\n\nThe Rams will arrive in Tucson on Christmas day.\n\nThe Arizona Bowl was originally set up to select teams from the Mountain West, Conference USA or the Sun Belt, but the latter two didn't meet all of their obligations. With a record 80 teams needed to fill spots, the equation started getting messy when only 77 teams were bowl-eligible. The NCAA ruled the empty spots could be filled by 5-7 teams, ranking them based on APR.\n\nNevada (6-6) finished second in the West Division behind San Diego State. The Wolf Pack and Rams faced six common foes, with both beating New Mexico and Fresno State, both losing to Utah State and San Diego State. Colorado State beat both UNLV and Wyoming, teams Nevada lost to this season.\n\nThe two didn't play this year, nor will they next year. They played as part of cross-division play the two years prior, with Colorado State winning both games.\n\nThe last time two teams from the same conference played in a non-playoff bowl game was 1979 when Oklahoma played Nebraska in the Orange Bowl.\n\nMike Brohard: 970-635-3633, mbrohard@reporter-herald.com or twitter.com/mbrohard", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.reporterherald.com/sports/ci_29209926/colorado-state-football-off-arizona-bowl", "modificationDate": "2015-12-06T15:32:28-0700", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site47/2015/1206/20151206__07rhscsufbbowlw~1_300.jpg", "sailthru.author": "By Mike Brohard \n \n  Sports Editor", "description": "FORT COLLINS \u2014 For the third time in program history,  Colorado State's football team gets to take part in an inaugural bowl game.", "ag": {"canon": "LovelandReporter-Herald:article:29209926:view"}, "startDate": "2015-12-06T15:32:00-0700", "og": {"url": "http://www.reporterherald.com/sports/ci_29209926/colorado-state-football-off-arizona-bowl", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site47/2015/1206/20151206__07rhscsufbbowlw~1.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "FORT COLLINS \u2014 For the third time in program history,  Colorado State's football team gets to take part in an inaugural bowl game.", "title": "Colorado State football off to Arizona Bowl"}, "twitter": {"domain": "reporterherald.com", "description": "FORT COLLINS \u2014 For the third time in program history,  Colorado State's football team gets to take part in an inaugural bowl game.", "title": "Colorado State football off to Arizona Bowl", "url": "http://www.reporterherald.com/sports/ci_29209926/colorado-state-football-off-arizona-bowl", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site47/2015/1206/20151206__07rhscsufbbowlw~1.jpg", "site": "@reporterherald", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-12-06T15:32:00-0700", "sailthru.site": "reporterherald.com", "endDate": "2025-12-06T15:30:18-0700", "sailthru.title": "Colorado State football off to Arizona Bowl", "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "sailthru.section": "Sports", "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "google-site-verification": "XzsHDcJw4iXBQEYtDXFRaUAdKzxhSvxWMgXyQQNFFzg", "byline": "By Mike BrohardSports", "sailthru.image.full": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site47/2015/1206/20151206__07rhscsufbbowlw~1.jpg", "pubDate": "2015-12-06T15:32:46-0700", "news_keywords": "Sports, Sports news, Loveland Colorado Sports news, Loveland Colorado news, Sports Loveland news, Sports Colorado news, US Sports news, world Sports news."}, "article_summary": "( GARY KAZANJIAN / The Associated Press )FORT COLLINS \u2014 For the third time in program history, Colorado State's football team gets to take part in an inaugural bowl game.\nColorado State also appeared in the first New Orleans Bowl (2001) and the Poinsettia Bowl (2005).\nRams play in an inaugural game for third time; facing MW foe NevadaColorado State will close its season in a bowl game against Mountain West foe Nevada in the inaugural Arizona Bowl on Dec. 29.\nThe last time two teams from the same conference played in a non-playoff bowl game was 1979 when Oklahoma played Nebraska in the Orange Bowl.\nColorado State beat both UNLV and Wyoming, teams Nevada lost to this season."}
