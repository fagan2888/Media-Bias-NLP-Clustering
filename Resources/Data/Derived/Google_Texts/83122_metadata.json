All times local:\n\n3:15 p.m.\n\nBelgian authorities have launched a raid in southern Belgium linked to the Paris attacks but did not detain any suspects.\n\nThe raid in Sambreville, 80 kilometers (50 miles) south of Brussels and close to the French border, was carried out around noon. The area was cordoned off and a mobile lab was on place.\n\nThe federal prosecutor's office refused to divulge any further details.\n\n2:45 p.m.\n\nA civil protection squad has decontaminated several people as a precaution at the main Brussels mosque after a suspicious parcel arrived.\n\nThe person who opened the package discovered white powder and immediately contacted the authorities. A specialized crew from the fire department was sent, witnesses at the scene said.\n\nFire brigade Capt. Anne Wibin said 11 people underwent a precautionary decontamination until it could be exactly established what the powder is. She said it will take six hours to analyze the powder, but it is not radioactive.\n\n1 p.m.\n\nFrench authorities have extended a measure banning fans from visiting teams from attending soccer matches in the wake of the Paris attacks.\n\nThe French soccer league said all professional matches this weekend all across the country will be played without traveling fans in accordance with a decision by Interior Ministry.\n\nIt said the measure will be implemented during Champions League, Europa League, French league and French Cup matches until mid-December \"because of a lack of availability of security forces under the emergency state\" as well as due to a major climate change meeting in Paris from Nov. 30 to Dec. 11.\n\nSecurity checks including metal detectors, bag searches and body pat-downs have been reinforced at stadiums after attackers on Nov. 13 targeted France's national stadium as well as bars, restaurants and a concert hall in Paris, killing 130 people and wounding hundreds. Islamic State militants have claimed responsibility for the carnage.\n\nNoon\n\nThe co-founder of Eagles of Death Metal, the band that was playing at Paris' Bataclan concert hall on Nov. 13 when it was attacked, says he wants the rock group to return there when the concert venue reopens.\n\nIn an emotional interview with Vice released late Wednesday, the band, whose members escaped the carnage, described the moments of shock and horror. Choking back sobs, Jesse Hughes promised to return to the site where 89 people died at the hands of Islamic extremists -- among the 130 people killed in Paris on that Friday night.\n\nHughes says \"I want to be the first band to play in the Bataclan when it opens back up.\"\n\nHe says \"Our friends went there to see rock and roll and died. I'm going to go back there and live.\"\n\n10:25 a.m.\n\nItaly's prime minister has renewed his commitment to fighting terrorism alongside France, saying a broader coalition is needed to destroy the Islamic State group \"and the atrocious project that it represents.\"\n\nIn a meeting Thursday with the French president, Matteo Renzi said that Libya must be a priority, saying the north African country `'risks to be the biggest emergency.\"\n\nFrench President Francois Hollande is in the midst of a weeklong push for a stronger coalition against Islamic State militants after the Nov. 13 attacks in Paris that killed 130 and left hundreds injured. Hollande leaves Thursday for a meeting in Moscow with Russian President Vladimir Putin. He has already spoken with U.S. President Barack Obama.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Belgian authorities have launched a raid in southern Belgium linked to the Paris attacks but did not detain any suspects.", "language": "english", "author": "Associated Press", "og": {"url": "http://www.kake.com/home/headlines/Authorities-carry-out-raid-in-southern-Belgium-354723301.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/paris+attacks10.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Belgian authorities have launched a raid in southern Belgium linked to the Paris attacks but did not detain any suspects.", "title": "Authorities carry out raid in southern Belgium"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.kake.com", "description": "Belgian authorities have launched a raid in southern Belgium linked to the Paris attacks but did not detain any suspects.", "title": "Authorities carry out raid in southern Belgium", "url": "http://www.kake.com/home/headlines/Authorities-carry-out-raid-in-southern-Belgium-354723301.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/paris+attacks10.jpg", "creator": "@KAKEnews", "site": "@KAKEnews", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "keywords": "Authorities carry out raid in southern Belgium", "google-site-verification": "H0mev8O__gMqb34WcvOyZgBXFMRQZvDAQ0YTSGJ9hGQ", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Authorities carry out raid in"}, "article_summary": "All times local:3:15 p.m.Belgian authorities have launched a raid in southern Belgium linked to the Paris attacks but did not detain any suspects.\nIslamic State militants have claimed responsibility for the carnage.\nThe raid in Sambreville, 80 kilometers (50 miles) south of Brussels and close to the French border, was carried out around noon.\n10:25 a.m.Italy's prime minister has renewed his commitment to fighting terrorism alongside France, saying a broader coalition is needed to destroy the Islamic State group \"and the atrocious project that it represents.\"\n1 p.m.French authorities have extended a measure banning fans from visiting teams from attending soccer matches in the wake of the Paris attacks."}
