But many fans don\u2019t really know what goes into the product they see on the field week-in and week-out throughout the season.\n\nThe Stanford football team has become renown in recent years for committing to a run-first, physical style of play on the offensive side of the ball. Head Coach David Shaw and Offensive Coordinator Mike Bloomgren have implemented an offensive philosophy similar to that of an NFL team, and in doing so have become the envy of hundreds of coaches at all levels of football. Stanford, unlike many teams, has a true offensive \u201cidentity\u201d from which they rarely stray.\n\nThe video above, produced by Stanford Graduate Assistant Coach Derek Belch, provides a \u201cbehind-the-scenes\u201d look at Stanford\u2019s play-calling philosophy through the minds and words of the Stanford coaching staff. Interviews with Bloomgren, Quarterbacks Coach Tavita Pritchard (who himself played quarterback at Stanford from 2004 to 2008) and Special Teams Coordinator Pete Alamar provide a unique perspective on the creation of a play, play-calling philosophy and how they prepare their players for what happens on the field on game day.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Derek Belch,football,Mike Bloomgren,Sports,stanford,Stanford Cardinal,Stanford Football,Stanford offense,Stanford University,Tavita Pritchard,Culture & Features,Frontpage Featured,Multimedia", "description": "Many football fans don\u2019t really know what goes into the product they see on the field weekly throughout the season.
