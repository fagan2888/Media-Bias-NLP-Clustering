Since 2010, the Cole Bros. Circus has been kicking off the fall season in Bay County with their shows.

This year the circus set up their tent at Frank Brown a little early than usual, but the crowds are still packing the big top.

The circus had two shows Friday and will have three shows on Saturday, and two more on Sunday.

Ringmaster Chris Connors said he has been hearing great reactions from locals and visitors.

"The reaction is unbelievable, people love to be here," said Connors. "There is a lot of fun, excitement atmosphere. You can come to the circus, ride an elephant, ride a pony, meet the clowns, funnel cakes, popcorn, cotton candy. What else can you ask for, but right here at the Cole Bros. Circus."

There will be two shows on Sunday afternoon at 1:30 p.m. and 4:30 p.m.
