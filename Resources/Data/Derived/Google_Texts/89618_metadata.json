Records show Madonna, whose legal name is Madonna Louise Ciccone, moved for the judge to enforce that order.\n\nOn Wednesday, Kaplan said she wasn't going to remove the order but also said she wasn't planning on issuing a warrant to compel Ritchie to appear in New York.\n\nRitchie, who directed the 1998 thriller \"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels,\" and Madonna divorced in New York in 2008.\n\nNeither parent appeared in court, instead calling in from abroad. She performed Sunday in Singapore and is scheduled to perform Saturday in Auckland, New Zealand. Ritchie called in from London.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Madonna, Ritchie urged to resolve teen son's custody case - AP News: NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Madonna and Guy Ritchie should think .05/26/2016 10:13:50AM EST.", "author": "AP News", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Madonna and Guy Ritchie should think of their 15-year-old son's best", "title": "AP News - Madonna, Ritchie urged to resolve teen son's custody case", "url": "http://townhall.com/news/us/2016/03/02/madonna-ritchie-urged-to-resolve-teen-sons-custody-case-n2127840", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2016\\62\\2c6c9020-8eb2-48e1-a06e-414883085407.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Madonna and Guy Ritchie should think of their 15-year-old son's best", "title": "AP News - Madonna, Ritchie urged to resolve teen son's custody case", "url": "http://townhall.com/news/us/2016/03/02/madonna-ritchie-urged-to-resolve-teen-sons-custody-case-n2127840", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2016/62/2c6c9020-8eb2-48e1-a06e-414883085407.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Madonna, Ritchie urged to resolve teen son's custody case, AP News, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0794\"", "article_summary": "Ritchie, who directed the 1998 thriller \"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels,\" and Madonna divorced in New York in 2008.\nRecords show Madonna, whose legal name is Madonna Louise Ciccone, moved for the judge to enforce that order.\n\"If they cannot resolve this matter then eventually the court will.\"\nEllen Sigal, a court-appointed attorney for Rocco Ritchie, said her client has been stressed about his future since leaving his mother's worldwide tour last year to stay with Ritchie in London, where he now attends school.\nNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Madonna and Guy Ritchie should think of their 15-year-old son's best interests and quickly resolve a months-long dispute over with whom the boy will live, a state judge said in a proceeding Wednesday in Manhattan."}
