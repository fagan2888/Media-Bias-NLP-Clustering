The suggested amendment would make Congress the gatekeepers of acceptable political speech in America. It was so draconian Reid placed a clause in the measure exempting the mainstream media.\n\nThe onslaught on free speech, Reid admitted, was planned to silence two men: Charles and David Koch.\n\nThe billionaire industrialists were \u201cconcealing their massive fundraising efforts because Americans overwhelmingly oppose the purchase of our democracy,\u201d said Reid from the well of the Senate. \u201cA constitutional amendment is what this nation needs to bring sanity back to political campaigns and restore Americans\u2019 confidence in their elected leaders. Let\u2019s put an end to the cult of dark money, which is corrupting our elections.\u201d\n\nThe old, discredited and tired Bill of Rights, as written by the nation\u2019s Founders, says \u201cCongress shall make no law\u201d abridging speech. The U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in Citizens United vs. Federal Election Commission overturned the McCain-Feingold campaign finance regulations as violations of First Amendment free speech.\n\nWith Congress no longer controlling the money paying for political speech, that political speech, protected from the prying eyes of a politicized IRS and vindictive left wing pressure groups, began making its way onto America\u2019s airwaves.\n\nThe thing that got President Obama and Harry Reid upset were political ads produced by the organization Americans for Prosperity (AFP). According to Sourcewatch.org, AFP paid $56 million \u201con TV, radio, and digital ads and direct mail, and another $21 million on grassroots efforts from their state chapters.\u201d\n\nOne ad in particular got under Obama and Reid\u2019s skin: the one featuring cancer and Obamacare victim Julie Boonstra. \u201cI found this wonderful doctor and a great health care plan,\u201d said Boonstra in the AFP ad. \u201cI was doing fairly well, fighting the cancer, fighting the leukemia. And then I received the letter. My insurance was canceled because of Obamacare. Now the out-of-pocket costs are so high, it\u2019s unaffordable. If I do not receive my medication, I will die.\u201d\n\nSo powerful was the ad, the mainstream media began waging a damage-control campaign for the Democratic Party, which entailed attacking the cancer victim, Julie Boonstra.\n\nThat failed.\n\nThe next step involved demonizing the founders of AFP, the Koch brothers. The charge against them, advanced by Reid and the mainstream media, was that \u201cradical billionaires are attempting to buy our democracy \u2026 families who don\u2019t have endless funds to dump into political campaigns are expected to sit on the sidelines and watch,\u201d Reid told POLITICO. \u201cWhen I say that Americans are watching the Koch brothers trying to influence the November elections, I mean that literally.\u201d\n\nSince the Senate version of Obamacare was passed into law in 2010, 29 Senate Democrats have joined the ranks of America\u2019s unemployed. Last Tuesday, angry voters joined with the brothers Koch in seeing Reid and his fellow liberty-crushing Democrats as the focus of evil in modern America.\n\n\u201cIn a truly free society,\u201d wrote Charles Koch in the Wall Street Journal, \u201cany business that disrespects its customers will fail, and deserves to do so. The same should be true of any government that disrespects its citizens. The central belief and fatal conceit of the current administration is that you are incapable of running your own life, but those in power are capable of running it for you. This is the essence of big government and collectivism.\u201d\n\nThe day after Democratic Party shellacking 2.0, the New York Times lead editorial said the Republican controlled Congress \u201cwill repeal health care reform. They will roll back new regulations on banks and Wall Street. They will stop the Obama administration\u2019s plans to curb coal emissions and reform immigration and invest in education.\u201d\n\nFrom their lips to God\u2019s ears.
