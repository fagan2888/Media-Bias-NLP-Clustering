(AP) - Seventh-graders in all public and private schools in Rhode Island are now required to get the HPV vaccine.\n\nStarting this fall, seventh-graders who do not get the vaccine will not be allowed to attend school unless their parents seek an exemption for medical or religious reasons, the Providence Journal (http://bit.ly/1I1Ibq2) reported Tuesday.\n\nTricia Washburn, chief of the office of immunization for the Rhode Island Department of Health, said the Centers for Disease Control found no safety concerns with the vaccine.\n\n\u201cThe bottom line is that HPV is the most sexually transmitted disease in the U.S.\u201d she said. \u201cWe are interested in protecting the public health. We feel it shouldn\u2019t be treated any differently than any of the other vaccines recommended by the CDC.\u201d\n\nShe said the Department of Health mandated the vaccine, unlike most states, because Rhode Island incorporates all CDC-recommended vaccines into the state\u2019s school immunization regulations. Rhode Island joins Virginia and Washington, D.C. in requiring the vaccine.\n\nThe Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonprofit focusing on national health issues, said there are more than 14 million new infections every year. The virus is linked to genital cancers, particularly cervical cancer in women.\n\nBut Christy Ciesla, of Providence, a doctor of physical therapy who specializes in women\u2019s health, said \u201cthere really isn\u2019t any good data that this vaccine actually prevents cancer.\u201d\n\nIn a study of 86,000 children, Ciesla said the research found the vaccine prevented some cervical abnormalities that could lead to cancer.\n\n\u201cIf I knew this vaccine would prevent cancer,\u201d she said, \u201cI would definitely consider it.\u201d\n\nSome concerned parents have begun to petition repeal the regulation through a Facebook group called Rhode Islanders Against Mandated HPV Vaccinations.\n\nThe state will hold hearings in August to give parents information and answer their questions.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The Providence Journal, http://www.providencejournal.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "Seventh-graders in all public and private schools in Rhode Island are now required to get the HPV vaccine.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jul/29/rhode-island-mandates-student-hpv-vaccine/", "site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "type": "article", "description": "Seventh-graders in all public and private schools in Rhode Island are now required to get the HPV vaccine.", "title": "Rhode Island mandates HPV vaccine for seventh-graders"}, "twitter": {"description": "Seventh-graders in all public and private schools in Rhode Island are now required to get the HPV vaccine.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Rhode Island mandates HPV vaccine for seventh-graders"}, "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8d54\"", "article_summary": "PROVIDENCE, R.I.
