What we\u2019re hearing now is the true voice of liberal arrogance. [T]hey believe they know the right way\u2014they have to lead the masses to the Promised Land, and they can only do it by deception. And that\u2019s what he said openly\u2026[they] lied about everything.\u201d\n\nIndeed they did. But in this instance, of course, the ends justified the means. It didn\u2019t matter that the bill was so flawed it needed to be amended dozens of times. It didn\u2019t matter that zero Congressional Democrats read the bill in its entirety before voting for it. It didn\u2019t matter that a majority of Americans opposed the bill from the beginning. And of course, as Guy explained this morning, it didn\u2019t matter that the law would never, ever work as promised:\n\nObamacare kicked millions of people off of their preferred insurance plans (with millions more to come), is signing up far fewer newly-insured consumers than projected, is hurting many more people than it's helping, and is still expected by the government to leave roughly 30 million Americans without insurance.\n\nAnd yet, as Krauthammer noted, critics of the law foresaw all of these problems years ago. All of them. They weren't \"fooled\" or \"tricked\" by the law's designers. So is it not, as Krauthammer said, somewhat of a scandal that it\u2019s only now becoming clear that the law's architects lied, misled, and parsed language to get their bill passed?\n\nI\u2019ll leave you with Ed Morrissey\u2019s smart analysis: Namely, when Gruber dismisses \u201cstupid Americans\u201d for buying into\u2014and ultimately supporting\u2014the president's healthcare reform law, he\u2019s not talking about conservatives:\n\nLet\u2019s not forget that when Gruber calls voters stupid, it can\u2019t be applied to those who opposed ObamaCare on the very same grounds as he states in these videos. Critics had made these arguments all along about the deceptive structure of the bill, and the lies being told to cover it up. Gruber\u2019s talking about the Obama coalition in these remarks.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Yup..05/26/2016 19:21:35PM EST.", "author": "Daniel Doherty", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Yup.", "title": "Daniel Doherty - Krauthammer: Gruber Comments Prove Progressives \"Lied About Everything\"", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/danieldoherty/2014/11/12/krauthammer-gruber-comments-prove-progressives-lied-about-everything-n1917806", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/uploads/2014/11/12/11.png", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "Yup.", "title": "Daniel Doherty - Krauthammer: Gruber Comments Prove Progressives \"Lied About Everything\"", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/danieldoherty/2014/11/12/krauthammer-gruber-comments-prove-progressives-lied-about-everything-n1917806", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/uploads/2014/11/12/11.png", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Krauthammer: Gruber Comments Prove Progressives \"Lied About Everything\", Daniel Doherty, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "It didn\u2019t matter that the bill was so flawed it needed to be amended dozens of times.\nIt didn\u2019t matter that a majority of Americans opposed the bill from the beginning.\nIt didn\u2019t matter that zero Congressional Democrats read the bill in its entirety before voting for it.\nAnd yet, as Krauthammer noted, critics of the law foresaw all of these problems years ago.\nCritics had made these arguments all along about the deceptive structure of the bill, and the lies being told to cover it up."}
