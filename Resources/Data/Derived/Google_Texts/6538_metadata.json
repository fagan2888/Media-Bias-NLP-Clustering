They noted that language in the plan says it cannot be appealed, but they have proven that wrong. They vowed to take the case all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court if necessary.\n\nThe Detroit Active and Retired Employees Association (DAREA), which sponsored the event, has been steadily growing since retirees are now seeing in hard numbers just how much they will lose under the bankruptcy. DAREA leaders said they are determined to collect enough funding to retain attorneys and file a brief by the Jan. 28 deadline, using an online donation site at http://www.gofundme.com/pensiondefensefund. #sthash.zhqNKVny.dpuf and through other collections routed to DAREA P.O. Box 3724, Highland Park, MI 48203.\n\n\u201cIf people from the media were to be open and objective,\u201d DAREA president William Davis said, \u201cyou would report that Tricky Rick Snyder got a free ride. If Kwame Kilpatrick is serving 28 years in prison, then each of the people involved in this bankruptcy should get 288 years.\u201d\n\nHe noted later that he shouldn\u2019t have to choose between paying for his family health care and sending his sons to college.\n\nAll general system retirees who left in 2003 and afterwards are losing huge chunks of their Annuity Savings Funds, money they paid in themselves apart from pension subsidies. Davis is a Detroit Water and Sewerage Department retiree who spent over 31 years there. He stands to lose $142,000 from his annuities.\n\nHe explained, \u201cThose employees who retired beginning in 2003 are mostly Black, hired in under Mayor Coleman Young 30 years ago.\u201d\n\nYvonne Williams-Jones took apart the media\u2019s continuing claim that retirement system members voted \u201coverwhelmingly\u201d for the plan.\n\n\u201cOnly 6,000 voted to accept in Class II, while 2,700 voted NO,\u201d Williams-Jones said. \u201cLess than 49 percent of the membership voted at all. That small Yes vote was rammed down retirees\u2019 throats through deceit and lies.\u201d\n\nDave Sole of the Stop the Theft of Our Pensions Committee congratulated DAREA on filing its appeal.\n\n\u201cThis is nothing but a vicious terrorist attack against tens of thousands of poor people,\u201d he said. \u201cKevyn Orr boasted that they carried out this grand theft \u2018without a civil uprising.\u2019 Perhaps we could have stopped it the way young people around the country are rising up against killings by police\u2014by shutting down freeways, streets, banks and courts. The banks took almost 100 percent of what they were owed in this deal and walked away. The \u2018Grand Bargain\u2019 is only $190 million over 20 years, about the same amount lawyers from Jones Day and other firms pushing the bankruptcy got over 18 months.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cGrand Bargain\u201d (a/k/a \u201cGrand Theft)\u201d was negotiated by bankruptcy sponsors with the unions and retirement systems to provide a small amount of funding for pensions. In return, the city got out of paying its share into the system for at least the next 10 years, and thousands of city workers\u2019 jobs are being privatized, further diminishing payments into the retirement systems.\n\n\u201cOther states and cities, and the federal government, are now contemplating bankruptcy,\u201d Sole added. \u201cBut we plan to fight. We\u2019re old but we ain\u2019t dead.\u201d\n\nDAREA Vice-President Cecily McClellan blasted the state of Michigan for refusing to contribute what it owes to Detroit.\n\n\u201cThe state withheld over $1 billion in revenue-sharing to Detroit,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was aided by an unfair and tremendously negative media campaign. In return, it got nearly all the city\u2019s assets, and stole our pensions and health care.\u201d\n\nLater, she said DAREA is actively recruiting attorneys, noting that Pontiac city employees were successful in restoring their health care benefits, even under an emergency manager, after their case was heard at the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals. She also noted that both County and State retirees have been successful in having their \u201c13th check,\u201d a bonus drawn from their retirement system\u2019s investments, restored. Detroit retirees lost theirs in 2003.\n\nThis reporter, who is also a city retiree and member of DAREA, noted that a Voice of Detroit analysis of the bankruptcy\u2019s 16 claims classes showed that corporations and the banks got 95.9 percent of their original debts, once land and assets ceded to Syncora and FGIC, and the creation of the Great Lakes Water Authority including restoration of $2 billion in impaired DWSD claims were included in the mix. Meanwhile, retirees got 13.7 percent of their claims.\n\n\u201cSyncora and FGIC insured the 2005-06 Pension Obligation Certificates, which even Kevyn Orr said in a lawsuit filed in bankruptcy court, were \u2018void ab initio, illegal and unenforceable,\u2019\u201d Bukowski said. \u201cThe lawsuit was withdrawn as part of the confirmation. Meanwhile, Mike Illitch\u2019s hockey arena plan is funded 60 percent by public tax dollars, including school aid money, and Dan Gilbert is taking over downtown. This is genocide\u2014all you have to do is look at Campus Martius to see that downtown Detroit is now overrun by whites in an 82 percent Black city.\u201d\n\nWalter Knall, who spent 31 \u00bd years at the now dismantled Detroit Health Department, said Detroit\u2019s future is bleak despite media reports that the city has been \u201creborn.\u201d\n\n\u201cOn March 1, foreclosure notices will go out to put another 32,000 people out of their homes,\u201d Knall said. \u201cThe banks are not only attacking pensioners, but citizens as well.\u201d\n\nDetroit\u2019s public safety uniformed workers, while not taking pension cuts, have been deprived of their health care, as have all active and retired city workers under the age of 65, who must now apply for Obamacare. Active city employees are also re-applying for their own jobs, from the Detroit Water and Sewerage Department, handed over to the Great Lakes Water Authority, to finance, purchasing, payroll and other workers at the Coleman A. Young Center.\n\nTijuana Morris, a retired Detroit police officer, elicited loud applause when she cried out, \u201cWe are human beings! I\u2019m going to fight until I can\u2019t fight no more!\u201d\n\nKeith Hines, of Diamond II Productions, said, \u201cThrough this bankruptcy, the city qualifies under legal definitions as a syndicate, racketeers subject to the RICO (Racketeer-Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act).\u201d\n\nAn active worker with the City of Detroit sign shop, was also enraged.\n\n\u201cShow us in writing where a 7.9 percent return on our annuities is illegal,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s OUR money. I got up every day and worked for it. You owe US for everything you took. This is a war against a BLACK city. The whole world is based on the rich and the poor. Meanwhile, while the dope boy makes money, [Detroit\u2019s young people have to get minimum wage jobs.]\u201d\n\nWanda Hill of the DAREA fund-raising committee, said if 2,000 retirees contribute $200 each, that would total $400,000, enough funds to retain an attorney. She announced that in addition to its GoFundMe campaign, DAREA will sponsor a champagne reception/fundraiser Feb. 19 at the Detroit Repertory Theatre, which is showing the play, \u201cSweet Pea\u2019s Mama,\u201d a story about racial dignity and a developmentally challenged son. Information on the play is available at the DRT website, http://www.detroitreptheatre.com/.\n\nNumerous new members of the audience signed up to work with DAREA\u2019s fund-raising, legal, communications, and other committees.\n\nPETITION: Sign the petition to halt changes to pensions and other benefits, to U.S. Justice Department, at http://petitions.moveon.org/sign/selective-enforcement?source=s.icn.em.mt&r_by=9645222.\n\nFUNDRAISING: To donate to DAREA\u2019s LEGAL DEFENSE FUND, click on http://www.gofundme.com/pensiondefensefund.

They focused primarily on making retirees over 60 aware of their options under the plan\u2019s \u201cincome stabilization\u201d fund, which is supposed to make small additional payments to them if they fall slightly above or below the poverty line.\n\nTrustee Felicia Johnson, however, blasted the bankruptcy plan.\n\n\u201cMy aunt just called me and said she received a letter indicating she is losing $11,000 under this plan,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cI don\u2019t know how we got to thinking this is the only way of solving Detroit\u2019s problems. Where are the Federal and State governments? We just gave millions to Mike Illitch for his stadium, and we helped bail out the auto industry. But retirees will end up living at the poverty level. Somebody\u2019s going to jump out a window. Do we have an end in mind for this madness? My dad was one of the first Black bricklayers for the city. We need to go back and re-open this deal!\u201d\n\nTrustee Rev. Wendell Anthony said they could not sue while the bankruptcy was pending, because \u201cit would have stopped the whole process.\u201d The retirement systems and unions all agreed NOT TO APPEAL even after confirmation, or challenge the bankruptcy under the state and federal constitutions despite the fact that Art. 9, Sec. 24 of the State constitution protects public pension benefits. It is in fact enshrined in PA 436, the Emergency Manager Act, which requires EM\u2019s to adhere to its provisions.\n\nAnthony and other trustees discussed raising private funds from DTE, which ironically has just applied for a rate increase, and other entities. Later, a retiree told Anthony that the bankruptcy process SHOULD have been stopped.\n\nDAREA President William Davis put the trustees on notice that DAREA IS appealing the bankruptcy, and along with Vice-President Cecily McClellan fronted them off on the various irregularities and illegalities in the plan.\n\n\u201cYou are demeaning retirees, pushing us into welfare,\u201d McClellan said. \u201cSeventy-five percent of retirees who got hit with annuity cuts are African-American, making us a disparate class [subject to protection under the 14th Amendment and the Equal Employment Opportunity Act.]\n\nRetiree Russ Bellant said the DGRS itself is attacking its members\u2019 rights independently of the bankruptcy plan.\n\n\u201cI was dumbfounded when I applied to take $20,000 out of my ASF funds last year, to help develop my neighborhood. I waited two months, and then received a letter denying my request because this board passed a resolution Oct. 29 saying they would take the plan recoupment money out of our annuity savings funds.\u201d\n\nThus. he said, the board itself froze the funds even before the bankruptcy confirmation plan was officially finalized Dec. 10.\n\nSome retirees folded their annuities into their pension checks at retirement to boost their monthly checks, while others rolled them over into private plans. Bellant and others, however, kept their annuities intact in the Retirement System, similar to a bank savings account.\n\n\u201cOur neighborhood has massive vacancies,\u201d Bellant said. \u201cI already put $40,000 into rehabbing two houses, and planned to finish with this $20,000. Now I will not be able to complete the job. I basically trusted you to hold my funds, not to seize them. I know a lot of other retirees put in similar requests. Why can\u2019t you rescind this resolution?\u201d\n\nThe trustees did not make a motion to do so, claiming they did not have a choice under provisions of the Dec. 10 confirmation plan.\n\nThe board did agree to assist Cornell Squires, a former Detroit EMS Technician with the Fire Department, who said he has not received a non-duty disability pension since his application was approved in 2002. He actually retired in 1993, he said, after constant harassment because he was challenging the operability and condition of the EMS trucks.\n\nHe said he was certified as disabled shortly afterwards by the Social Security System, but he said the city doctor refused to certify him as such until much later. He said he actually should receive duty disability payments due to stress from the job and his battle for decent conditions, but would agree to non-duty disability payments.\n\n\u201cOne-third of the people working for EMS have died and continue to die from stress, and they don\u2019t even get to collect their pensions,\u201d Squires said. \u201cWhy do we do people wrong like this? For this Christmas, I\u2019m asking that you pay me my disability so I can move on with my life by getting what I\u2019m entitled to.\u201d\n\nRELATED:\n\nFor video of DAREA press conference, click on http://www.detiptv.com/.\n\nhttp://www.wxyz.com/news/retirees-working-on-appeal-to-detroits-plan-of-adjustment\n\nhttp://www.freep.com/story/news/local/detroit-bankruptcy/2015/01/08/detroit-bankruptcy-retirees-pension-cuts/21445939/\n\nhttp://michiganradio.org/post/detroit-retiree-group-vows-exhaust-appeals-process-bankruptcy-fight\n\nhttp://voiceofdetroit.net/2015/01/07/appeal-of-detroit-bankruptcy-accepted-in-u-s-district-court-press-conf-thurs-jan-8-10-am/\n\nhttp://voiceofdetroit.net/2014/12/14/leaving-bankruptcy-detroit-takes-on-1-28-billion-of-new-debt/\n\nhttp://voiceofdetroit.net/2014/11/20/judge-denies-all-but-pa-436-lawsuit-equal-protection-claim-after-detroit-bankruptcy-over/\n\nhttp://voiceofdetroit.net/2014/11/15/detroit-bankruptcy-plan-genocide-in-usas-largest-black-majority-city-rich-get-95-9-poor-get-13-5/\n\nhttp://voiceofdetroit.net/2014/10/28/bankruptcy-did-little-to-stabilize-detroit-municipal-market-advisors/\n\nhttp://voiceofdetroit.net/2014/10/21/why-the-poor-are-paying-for-detroits-bankruptcy/\n\nhttp://voiceofdetroit.net/2014/10/17/detroit-bankruptcy-creditor-fgic-to-get-joe-louis-arena-billions-based-on-fraudulent-poc-deal/\n\nhttp://voiceofdetroit.net/2014/10/16/detroit-retirees-officials-blast-bankruptcy-plan-em-at-last-minute-hearing/\n\nhttp://voiceofdetroit.net/2014/09/10/detroit-bankruptcy-great-lakes-water-authority-to-steal-largest-asset-of-largest-u-s-black-city-4/\n\nhttp://voiceofdetroit.net/2014/09/06/racist-bankruptcy-plan-hearing-sanctions-theft-of-detroit/", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://voiceofdetroit.net/2015/01/12/detroit-retirees-announce-federal-appeal-of-bankruptcy-call-for-massive-support/", "type": "article", "title": "DETROIT RETIREES ANNOUNCE FEDERAL APPEAL OF BANKRUPTCY, CALL FOR MASSIVE SUPPORT", "site_name": "VOICE OF DETROIT:  The city's independent newspaper, unbossed and unbought", "author": "Diane Bukowski"}}, "article_summary": "Retiree Russ Bellant said the DGRS itself is attacking its members\u2019 rights independently of the bankruptcy plan.\nDetroit retirees lost theirs in 2003.\nAll general system retirees who left in 2003 and afterwards are losing huge chunks of their Annuity Savings Funds, money they paid in themselves apart from pension subsidies.\nBellant and others, however, kept their annuities intact in the Retirement System, similar to a bank savings account.\nTrustee Felicia Johnson, however, blasted the bankruptcy plan."}
