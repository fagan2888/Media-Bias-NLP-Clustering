John Kasich stands as the best candidate in the GOP presidential field. Shown, he speaks in Concord, N.H. (Photo: The Enquirer/Meg Vogel)Buy Photo\n\nBallots cast for presidential candidates Donald Trump or Ted Cruz are votes for drastic change \u2013 votes to break a system that isn\u2019t working.\n\nA vote for John Kasich is a vote for an optimistic vision of our country and a roll-up-your-sleeves approach to achieving it.\n\nThe Enquirer editorial board shares the widespread frustration with years of Washington gridlock. However, throwing a bomb into a traffic jam only makes it worse. What\u2019s needed in the White House is a problem-solver \u2013 someone with the expertise and temperament to do the tedious work of democracy.\n\nThis board endorses Kasich for the Republican presidential nomination.\n\nOhioans know better than anyone that our governor is a pragmatic leader. He has chosen paths in areas such as education and health care that have made both the left and the right unhappy \u2013 paths that run down the middle, where compromise and the quiet majority live.\n\nOn the presidential trail, Kasich is the only candidate talking about a positive vision of the country \u2013 a vision of making America great together, not through exclusion and belittling of various groups.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of people out there yearning for somebody who\u2019s going to bring America back, both at the leadership level and in the neighborhood, where we can begin to reignite the spirit of the United States of America,\u201d he said in Thursday night\u2019s debate, likely his best of the campaign. \u201cAnd let\u2019s stop fighting!\u201d\n\nYes.\n\nEven in Kasich\u2019s own state, evangelicals and tea party members have not embraced him. But he is a real Republican. He opposes abortion and the Affordable Care Act. He wants lower taxes on businesses and less power for unions. He just signed a state bill defunding Planned Parenthood.\n\nAt the same time, Kasich has an executive\u2019s understanding of the complexity of issues that some want to reduce to simplistic slogans. He realizes that national education standards in the form of Common Core are necessary to keep American workers competitive with the rest of the world.\n\nHe has said what many to his right don\u2019t dare acknowledge about immigrants in the United States illegally: \u201cIt\u2019s inconceivable that we would start to round up 10 or 11 million people and start to ship them out of the country,\u201d he told Fox News. \u201cThe idea that we\u2019re going to deport all these people is ludicrous.\u201d\n\nThe Enquirer hasn\u2019t agreed with Kasich on everything \u2013 for example, his way of restoring the state\u2019s rainy day fund was to raid the pot of money that goes to local governments for basic services such as police and fire.\n\nStill, he\u2019s the obvious choice for the GOP nomination. He is a principled yet compassionate conservative with the right skill set. As a nine-term congressman, he helped balance the federal budget, and as governor he has led the Buckeye State through a difficult economic recovery.\n\nIt\u2019s Kasich\u2019s bad luck that he\u2019s running for president in a year when voters are gravitating toward the extremes. But the editorial board remains hopeful that voters will reconsider whether Trump, in particular, reflects our values as Americans.\n\nThe billionaire political novice has tapped into a deep reservoir of anger and fear in this country in a way that pits us against each other and demonizes individual groups ranging from Muslims to women. Many citizens understandably feel insecure about an economic recovery that hasn\u2019t brought prosperity and the United States\u2019 place in an uncertain world.\n\nBut turning against each other isn\u2019t the answer. Our strength is in our diversity. Trump\u2019s big talk may inspire confidence in some people, but it doesn\u2019t actually help anything. That takes work, and leadership.\n\nThursday night\u2019s debate proved once again now is the time for serious conversations and strong leadership focused on our nation\u2019s most important issues. We believe Kasich is best-equipped to confront those challenges with a pragmatic and proven leadership style that pulls the GOP nomination process from the hubris that has unfolded.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://cin.ci/1p4NwbA", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Ohio\u2019s governor brings an optimistic vision for our union and an understanding of how to work through complex issues.", "p": {"domain_verify": "8c50ff021dfc409ea7325f425f178799"}, "og": {"site_name": "Cincinnati.com", "description": "Ohio\u2019s governor brings an optimistic vision for our union and an understanding of how to work through complex issues.", "title": "Endorsement: John Kasich has the vision", "url": "http://www.cincinnati.com/story/opinion/editorials/2016/03/04/endorsement-john-kasich-vision/81315572/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/cincinnati.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Ohio\u2019s governor brings an optimistic vision for our union and an understanding of how to work through complex issues.", "title": "Endorsement: John Kasich has the vision", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/5d2b593ad8bb9501f5eb5c4c9fb2691f52cac7a7/c=417-0-2083-1666&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2016/03/04/Cincinnati/B9321165923Z.1_20160304113239_000_G05DKQC75.1-0.jpg", "creator": "@enquirer", "site": "@enquirer", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600019252", "fb": {"app_id": 157995810912644}, "viewport": "width=1070", "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Events/John Kasich  2016 Presidential Campaign", "gci-asset-type": "Story", "gci-categories": "Events/John Kasich  2016 Presidential Campaign", "title": "Endorsement: John Kasich has the vision", "author": "Enquirer editorial board", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "opinion/editorials", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/738a28766b4e50ac67a5d90aaa4bc2d4c1461366/c=625-0-1875-1666/local/-/media/2016/03/04/Cincinnati/B9321165923Z.1_20160304113239_000_G05DKQC75.1-0.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/ee4837a09596ec40943a7b259a53b5294f876d75/c=417-0-2083-1666/local/-/media/2016/03/04/Cincinnati/B9321165923Z.1_20160304113239_000_G05DKQC75.1-0.jpg", "contenttype": "Story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/de1f29591f7c9a21ee7103034c05abdc1ae8873a/c=140-0-2361-1666/local/-/media/2016/03/04/Cincinnati/B9321165923Z.1_20160304113239_000_G05DKQC75.1-0.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/fa9a822ded8637f5a1ba8e0b4d5410522cf0e028/c=0-130-2500-1536&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/2016/03/04/Cincinnati/B9321165923Z.1_20160304113239_000_G05DKQC75.1-0.jpg", "publishtime": "2016-03-04T11:54:17.923000-05:00", "shorthed": "Endorsement: John Kasich has the vision", "articleid": 81315572, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9d239220cf3ad93bfe09e480190a0a6213341477/c=0-130-2500-1536/local/-/media/2016/03/04/Cincinnati/B9321165923Z.1_20160304113239_000_G05DKQC75.1-0.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/3f0310b318c0b9a43332f2fee30d1a035704e5dd/c=782-0-1719-1666/local/-/media/2016/03/04/Cincinnati/B9321165923Z.1_20160304113239_000_G05DKQC75.1-0.jpg"}}, "news_keywords": "John Kasich, presidential candidate, endorsement, donald trump, marco rubio, ted cruz, nomination, GOP, republican"}, "article_summary": "A vote for John Kasich is a vote for an optimistic vision of our country and a roll-up-your-sleeves approach to achieving it.\nJohn Kasich stands as the best candidate in the GOP presidential field.\nOn the presidential trail, Kasich is the only candidate talking about a positive vision of the country \u2013 a vision of making America great together, not through exclusion and belittling of various groups.\nMany citizens understandably feel insecure about an economic recovery that hasn\u2019t brought prosperity and the United States\u2019 place in an uncertain world.\nAt the same time, Kasich has an executive\u2019s understanding of the complexity of issues that some want to reduce to simplistic slogans."}
