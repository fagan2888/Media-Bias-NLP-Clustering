So says an analysis of breastfeeding habits around the world published a few days ago in British medical journal The Lancet.\n\n\u201cBreast milk makes the world healthier, smarter, and more equal,\u201d says The Lancet. And the authors of the journal\u2019s analysis suggest that even though it\u2019s well known that breastfeeding is one of the most effective preventive health measures for kids and moms no matter where they live, governments haven\u2019t done nearly enough to support it.\n\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) agrees that breastfeeding plays a significant role in public health and encourages women to breastfeed their babies for at least 12 months, starting solids at 6 months while continuing to breastfeed as well until age 1. But for many reasons, most U.S. moms don\u2019t nurse their baby for nearly that long.\n\nSome women choose not to breastfeed, and some women are physically unable to. But for the many moms who can and want to nurse, here\u2019s the frustrating thing: It may be hard or impossible to find the guidance, support, and time to do it successfully. The Affordable Care Act tries to ease these hardships by requiring that insurance plans provide free breast pumps and lactation counseling, but it\u2019s not enough.\n\nGuidance & support: New mothers who have never breastfed usually need help learning how. Lactation consultants are experts who can help \u2013 but many exhausted new moms don\u2019t use one because they don\u2019t have insurance or know about the benefit. They have no one to show them how to hold their baby comfortably, how to get their baby to \u201clatch on\u201d properly, and how to avoid sore nipples and painful infections. Without support, they may give up in frustration.\n\nTime: If you\u2019re lucky enough to have a job with maternity leave, most likely you\u2019re looking at six weeks paid time off after having a baby. (Of 34 countries with \u201cadvanced economies\u201d \u2013 and that includes less-prosperous places like Poland and Bulgaria as well as wealthier ones \u2013 the United States is the only one that doesn\u2019t require paid maternity leave.) No wonder so many working moms give up by six weeks! Few have the time or privacy to pump once they\u2019re back on the job \u2013 even though most women whose employers are covered by The Affordable Care Act are required to offer nursing moms a clean, private space (not a bathroom) and sufficient time for pumping.\n\nSocial pressures: In spite of the laws that protect your right to nurse your baby in public, plenty of women face disapproval or worse when they attempt to do so. Families aren\u2019t always supportive, either \u2013 if your mother or mother-in-law didn\u2019t nurse her babies, she may not understand how important it is to you.\n\nOnly you know what\u2019s best for your baby.
