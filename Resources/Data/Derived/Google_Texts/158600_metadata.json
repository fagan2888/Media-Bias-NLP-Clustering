But a breakdown in the process instead is causing concern among some consumers about the handling of their personal information.\n\n\u201cI am in no man\u2019s land,\u201d said Roger N. Hampton of Boca Raton, Fla., who filed an application early last month. \u201cI have been waiting patiently for my ID verification to come through, which has not occurred thus far. So I can\u2019t see what plans are available.\u201d\n\nWhen he tried to file his application online, Mr. Hampton received a message that said: \u201cYour identity wasn\u2019t verified. You won\u2019t be able to submit your application for health coverage until your identity is verified. Submit documents that prove your identity. Once you upload your documents, they\u2019ll be reviewed. The results of your identity verification will be emailed to you.\u201d\n\nMr. Hampton hit a button that said, \u201cUpload documents\u201d and attached copies of his Social Security card and driver\u2019s license. He said he had heard nothing back.\n\nJohn W. Filbin of New London, N.H., reported a similar experience. \u201cI have been stuck in identity proofing since early October,\u201d he said Monday.\n\nOn Friday, the Obama administration announced that it would give people eight more days, until Dec. 23, to sign up for coverage that takes effect on Jan. 1\n\nBut Mr. Filbin said: \u201cWe don\u2019t need extra time. We\u2019ve been ready since Oct. 1. I have emailed and hard mailed my driver\u2019s license. We\u2019ve made our way through the slow and troubled website. Is there going to be a fix for us?\u201d\n\nPeople who cannot establish their identity by answering certain questions at HealthCare.gov are instructed to call the help desk at Experian, a credit reporting agency, for \u201cID proofing.\u201d\n\nCustomer service representatives for the federal marketplace and for Experian said they had received calls from many people who were unable to verify their identity, and internal government documents show that lower-level federal employees have known of a problem for weeks.\n\nJoanne Peters, a spokeswoman for the Department of Health and Human Services, said that 90 percent of consumers were able to create accounts and complete \u201cidentity proofing\u201d online.\n\n\u201cHowever,\u201d she said, \u201csome consumers whose information does not match records, such as when an alternate name is used or their address does not match, may be referred to a call center\u201d for identification verification, and in complicated cases they may experience \u201ca wait time before receiving a determination.\u201d\n\nMr. Filbin said he had called Experian, but got no help because he did not have a \u201creference number.\u201d Experian sent him back to HealthCare.gov, which has repeatedly indicated that his identity verification is \u201cin process.\u201d\n\nJo Ann Fields of Felton, Del., appears to be lost in the same labyrinth. \u201cI mailed a copy of my voter registration card on Oct. 24, and I have not heard anything back,\u201d Ms. Fields said. \u201cI uploaded the voter registration card, and they said I would get an email response. I have had no response. I called the health insurance marketplace \u2014 800-318-2596 \u2014 and they say to give it more time. My application is stuck in ID verification.\u201d\n\nConsumers said they worried that their identification papers were falling into a black hole. Ms. Fields said she imagined \u201ca bag of mail sitting on somebody\u2019s desk in London, Ky., with my voter registration card in it.\u201d Insurance agents and brokers who want to help people enroll in the federal marketplace also need to go through \u201cidentity proofing,\u201d and they say they, too, have experienced difficulties.\n\nMr. Filbin said the experience was particularly annoying because \u201cI am in favor of the Affordable Care Act,\u201d and he added: \u201cI was an Obama supporter. I think I still am, but a little less positive.\u201d\n\nExperian is based in Dublin. Two spokesmen for the company, Gerry Tschopp and Michael Troncale, said they could not discuss Experian\u2019s work for the federal insurance program because of restrictions in its contract with the government.\n\nThe federal website says identity verification is needed to protect consumers\u2019 personal information.\n\nConsumers are asked questions that, according to the government, only they can answer. The questions are based on information in their credit reports \u2014 even though federal officials expect to receive many applications from young people and low-income people with little credit history.\n\nThe administration said that the website had another \u201cunscheduled outage\u201d on Monday, for about an hour. Still, administration officials said they were on track to meet their commitment that HealthCare.gov would \u201cwork smoothly for the vast majority of users\u201d by Saturday.", "article_metadata": {"ptime": 20131125211732, "twitter": {"description": "Many people have had their applications cast into limbo after they uploaded copies of driver\u2019s licenses, Social Security cards and voter registration cards to HealthCare.gov.", "title": "ID Verification Lagging on Health Care Website", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/26/us/id-verification-lagging-on-health-care-website.html", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2013/11/26/us/HEALTH/HEALTH-thumbLarge-v2.jpg", "site": "@nytimes", "card": "summary"}, "xlarge": "images/2013/11/26/us/HEALTH/HEALTH-articleLarge.jpg", "thumbnail_width": 75, "hdl_p": "ID Verification Lagging on Health Care Website", "sectionfront_jsonp": "http://json8.nytimes.com/pages/national/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "November 25, 2013", "edt": "NewYork", "keywords": "Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (2010),Health Insurance and Managed Care,Computers and the Internet,Identification Devices,Obama  Barack,Experian Group Ltd,HealthCare.gov,Health and Human Services Department", "xlarge_height": 399, "news_keywords": "Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act", "PT": "Article", "author": "ROBERT PEAR", "thumbnail_150": "http://www.nytimes.com/images/2013/11/26/us/HEALTH/HEALTH-thumbLarge-v2.jpg", "per": "Obama, Barack", "thumbnail_150_width": 150, "xlarge_width": 600, "byl": "By ROBERT PEAR", "thumbnail_150_height": 150, "dsk": "U.S.", "lp": "Many people have had their applications cast into limbo after they uploaded copies of driver\u2019s licenses, Social Security cards and voter registration cards to HealthCare.gov.", "tom": "News", "thumbnail": "http://www.nytimes.com/images/2013/11/26/us/HEALTH/HEALTH-thumbStandard-v2.jpg", "description": "Many people have had their applications cast into limbo after they uploaded copies of driver's licenses, Social Security cards and voter registration cards to HealthCare.gov.", "ARTICLE_TEMPLATE_VERSION": 700, "CG": "us", "ROBOTS": "NOARCHIVE", "dat": "November 25, 2013", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "hdr_img": "/images/article/header/sect_us.gif", "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com/", "org": "Experian Group Ltd;HealthCare.gov;Health and Human Services Department", "thumbnail_height": 75, "slug": "26health", "utime": 20131126174142, "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/26/us/id-verification-lagging-on-health-care-website.html", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2013/11/26/us/HEALTH/HEALTH-videoSixteenByNine1050.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Many people have had their applications cast into limbo after they uploaded copies of driver\u2019s licenses, Social Security cards and voter registration cards to HealthCare.gov.", "title": "ID Verification Lagging on Health Care Website"}, "pdate": 20131125, "des": "Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (2010);Health Insurance and Managed Care;Computers and the Internet;Identification Devices", "articleid": 100000002571890, "cre": "The New York Times", "emailThisHash": "CPsWOSnDZxahRAlaJGMVxw", "hdl": "ID Verification Lagging on Health Care Website", "PST": "News"}, "article_summary": "The federal website says identity verification is needed to protect consumers\u2019 personal information.\nI called the health insurance marketplace \u2014 800-318-2596 \u2014 and they say to give it more time.\n\u201cI mailed a copy of my voter registration card on Oct. 24, and I have not heard anything back,\u201d Ms. Fields said.\n\u201cI uploaded the voter registration card, and they said I would get an email response.\n\u201cI have been waiting patiently for my ID verification to come through, which has not occurred thus far."}
