Supporters of the bill hoped the unanimous endorsement would lead to an overwhelming vote in the House, but they are running into last-minute opposition on the eve of the vote.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe bill includes $8.75 billion over five years in new funding for medical research at the National Institutes of Health (NIH).That spending is drawing fire from conservatives because it is mandatory, meaning it is not revisited each year through the appropriations process. Some Republicans oppose adding another spending program to the books and are upset that the move would bust budget caps put in place in 2011.\n\n\u201cAfter Medicare Part D, we ended up with ObamaCare, which is a huge increase in spending, and now we're wanting to have this,\u201d said Rep. John Fleming John FlemingOvernight Finance: Puerto Rico bill clears panel | IRS chief vows to finish term | Bill would require nominees to release tax returns House panel approves Puerto Rico debt relief Path clears for passage of Puerto Rico bill MORE (R-La.), a physician who works on health issues in the conservative House Freedom Caucus. \u201cLook what's happening in Greece and Puerto Rico.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, some Democrats are railing against a late addition to the bill that includes Hyde Amendment language further restricting the use federal funds for abortion services.\n\n\u201cI cannot stand by while these provisions are slipped into an otherwise excellent bill through underhanded maneuvers that run contrary to our democratic process,\u201d Rep. Jackie Speier (D-Calif.) said Thursday, claiming the language was added \u201cin the dead of night.\u201d\n\nSpeier, who was one of the original co-sponsors, pulled her support from the bill on Thursday. A spokesman said that at least five other Democrats are planning to oppose the bill, adding, \u201cI think there\u2019s some momentum.\u201d\n\nReps. Louise Slaughter (D-N.Y.) and Rosa DeLauro (D-Conn.) also spoke out against the abortion language in the bill.\n\n\u201cWhy in the world would you put in an abortion rider on a thing for medical research?\u201d Slaughter asked during floor debate.\n\nStill, the bill has 230 co-sponsors in the House, more than a majority. House Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Fred Upton (R-Mich.), the bill\u2019s main Republican champion, said Wednesday that he still hopes to get 300 votes in favor.\n\nThe bill's top Democratic supporters, meanwhile, expressed confidence that there would be broad support in their party for the bill on final passage despite the abortion flap.\n\n\u201cThere are always going to be some people that are against, but I think it\u2019ll be very few,\u201d Rep. Frank Pallone (D-N.J.) said, adding that the party \u201cis going to work hard to get rid of the riders.\u201d\n\nA Democratic aide said that the hope is a vote on an amendment to strip out the abortion language will help bring Democrats into the fold for the final vote.\n\n\u201cI think most people like me realized that these riders would have applied anyways,\u201d Rep. Diana DeGette (D-Colo.) said of the abortion provisions. \u201cThey\u2019re going to vote for the Lee amendment to strip them out, to send that message, and then they\u2019ll vote for final passage.\u201d\n\nThe Lee Amendment, sponsored by Rep. Barbara Lee (D-Calif.), would eliminate any abortion-related restrictions in the bill.\n\nOn the Republican side, proponents of the bill have been working to tamp down support for an amendment from Rep. Dave Brat (R-Va.) that would change the funding in the bill from mandatory to discretionary. Democrats warn that if the amendment passes Friday, support from their side will crumble because the NIH funding would be far less certain.\n\nUpton has also pushed back on conservative objections.\n\nWhen the conservative group Heritage Action urged members to oppose the bill on Tuesday, Republicans on the Energy and Commerce Committee replied that the move was \u201csurprisingly short-sighted.\u201d\n\nAsked about Heritage Action on Wednesday, Upton told The Hill, \u201cRemember, they opposed the [sustainable growth rate] doc fix too.\u201d That Medicare reform bill went on to pass the House overwhelmingly in March, despite Heritage Action\u2019s opposition.\n\nBehind the scenes, House Budget Committee Chairman Tom Price (R-Ga.) has also objected to the funds being mandatory.\n\n\u201cWe have a basic disagreement, that's just the way it's going to stay,\u201d Upton said of Price.\n\nPrice supports Brat\u2019s amendment but did not lend his name to it, not wanting to escalate the disagreement with Upton.\n\nOne aide to a conservative member said Brat\u2019s amendment would fail, giving cover to some conservatives who end up supporting the final bill.\n\n\u201cIt will have significant support but it won\u2019t have a majority of the House,\u201d said Rep. Kevin Yoder Kevin YoderOvernight Cybersecurity: FBI won't tell Apple how it hacked iPhone House unanimously passes email privacy bill House to take up email privacy bill this month MORE (R-Kan.), a conservative who supports the bill.\n\nBrat spoke out against the bill in the Republican conference meeting on Wednesday, saying if the NIH is really such a priority, then it shouldn\u2019t be hard for the Appropriations Committee to increase its funding through the normal process.\n\n\u201cIt's always easy up here to vote yes, yes, yes, yes, you know, \u2018learn to govern\u2019 and all these kind of phrases,\u201d he said. \u201cThe piece that's missing is the damage we're doing to the kids.\u201d\n\nEven Rep. Tom Cole (R-Okla.), a GOP leadership ally, raised concerns about the mandatory spending at a Rules Committee hearing Wednesday.\n\nHe said that while the funds only last for five years, the pressure on Congress would be too great not to renew them in the future.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t really believe we\u2019ll stop doing this in five years,\u201d he said at a Rules Committee hearing. \u201cI have a real hard time believing that.\u201d\n\nSpeaker John Boehner John BoehnerOvernight Finance: Puerto Rico bill clears panel | IRS chief vows to finish term | Bill would require nominees to release tax returns Overnight Defense: Pentagon chief fears sequestration's return GOP senator: Reid's 'ramblings' are 'bitter, vulgar, incoherent' MORE (R-Ohio) has sought to counter conservative concerns.\n\nBoehner John BoehnerOvernight Finance: Puerto Rico bill clears panel | IRS chief vows to finish term | Bill would require nominees to release tax returns Overnight Defense: Pentagon chief fears sequestration's return GOP senator: Reid's 'ramblings' are 'bitter, vulgar, incoherent' MORE\u2019s office touted the bill in a statement this week, noting that it fully pays for the spending it contains and is projected by the Congressional Budget Office to reduce the deficit by more than $500 million.\n\n\u201cThe bill not only paves the way for a new era of medical innovation, it does so by drawing on several conservative reforms that are good for taxpayers, and good for our economy,\u201d the Speaker\u2019s statement said.\n\nAnd like Yoder, some conservatives, including Reps.
