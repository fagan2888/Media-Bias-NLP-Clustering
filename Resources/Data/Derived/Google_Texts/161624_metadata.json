(AP) \u2014 With the Memorial Day holiday just around the corner, fallout from the oil spill that left Gulf Coast beaches smeared with gooey tar balls and scared away visitors in 2010 is being credited, oddly, with something no one imagined back then: An increase in tourism in the region.\n\nFive years after the BP disaster, the petroleum giant that was vilified during heated town hall meetings for killing a way of life is now being praised by some along the coast for spending more than $230 million to help lure visitors back to an area that some feared would die because of the spill.\n\nQuestions remain about the long-term environmental impacts of the BP disaster, with a report released just last week finding a definite link between the spill and a record die-off of the bottlenose dolphins that tourists love to spot along the northern Gulf Coast. Pockets of oil still blot the sea floor and spots along Louisiana\u2019s coast.\n\nMeanwhile, many are still wrangling with BP over spill-related claims. Attorneys for businesses and individuals claiming damages from the spill announced a $211 million settlement last week with Transocean Ltd., owner of the failed Deepwater Horizon drilling rig.\n\nYet, at the same time, parking lots are full outside the same coastal hotels and condominium towers that struggled for business and slashed prices while crude was pouring into the gulf off Louisiana\u2019s coast in 2010.\n\nVisitors bob in surf where oil once washed in, and some restaurants have 90-minute waits for dinner on the weekend. Tourist business has doubled in Alabama\u2019s largest beach towns since before the spill, officials say, and Pensacola Beach, Florida, is so clogged with visitors that traffic is a primary problem.\n\nMany attribute the change in large part to the millions of dollars that BP spent on tourism grants and advertising that promoted the Gulf Coast nationwide to people who previously didn\u2019t even realize that Alabama and Mississippi had coastlines.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve traveled as recently as the spring to California and there were people there who were saying, \u2018Hey, I saw those commercials about Alabama,\u201d said coastal condominium developer Bill Brett. \u201cI really think those commercials helped.\u201d\n\nBrett is an owner of Brett/Robinson Real Estate, where he said business is up about 30 percent since the year before the spill. The company has developed 19 buildings with more than 3,200 condo units on the Alabama coast, including one that was finished with a $37 million settlement from BP after the spill.\n\nThe tourism surge isn\u2019t happening in a vacuum: Many U.S. attractions have seen big increases during the same period as the economy recovered following the 2008 financial crisis and Americans returned to the road.\n\nThe theme parks of Orlando, Florida, helped draw a record 62 million visitors to the city last year, and the U.S. Travel Association expects Americans to spend about 5 percent more this Memorial Day than last.\n\nBut back in 2010, there were questions and fears over whether the tourist economy of the northern Gulf Coast would ever recover from the spill. Residents feared that images of oil-soaked birds and blackened beaches would permanently change travel patterns and leave towns like Gulf Shores, Alabama, and Destin, Florida, as the forgotten coast.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Once vilified, BP now getting credit for gulf tourism boom", "title": "Once vilified, BP now getting credit for gulf tourism boom", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Once vilified, BP now getting credit for gulf tourism boom", "title": "Once vilified, BP now getting credit for gulf tourism boom", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/05/25/once_vilified_bp_now_getting_credit_for_gulf_tourism_boom/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/05/aptopix-gulf-oil-spill-tourism.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Once vilified, BP now getting credit for gulf tourism boom", "title": "Once vilified, BP now getting credit for gulf tourism boom", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/05/aptopix-gulf-oil-spill-tourism.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Jay Reeves", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "But back in 2010, there were questions and fears over whether the tourist economy of the northern Gulf Coast would ever recover from the spill.\nResidents feared that images of oil-soaked birds and blackened beaches would permanently change travel patterns and leave towns like Gulf Shores, Alabama, and Destin, Florida, as the forgotten coast.\nVisitors bob in surf where oil once washed in, and some restaurants have 90-minute waits for dinner on the weekend.\nThe company has developed 19 buildings with more than 3,200 condo units on the Alabama coast, including one that was finished with a $37 million settlement from BP after the spill.\nMany attribute the change in large part to the millions of dollars that BP spent on tourism grants and advertising that promoted the Gulf Coast nationwide to people who previously didn\u2019t even realize that Alabama and Mississippi had coastlines."}
