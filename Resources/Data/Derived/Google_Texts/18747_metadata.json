But what if you\u2019d like to personalize it further by engraving the name of, say, your favorite reproductive organ on it? Well, that all depends on whether you\u2019re packing the bun, or the hot dog, so to speak.\n\nAccording to feminist blogger Justyn Hintze, Apple has an interesting policy when it comes to what they will and won\u2019t engrave on your iPad. Apparently, while the word \u201cpenis\u201d is kosher, the word \u201cvagina\u201d is not. Geez, guys, double standard much?\n\nHintze discovered Apple\u2019s policy earlier this week, when she bought a new iPad and decided to take advantage of Apple\u2019s free shipping/free engraving policy. But when she typed in a quote from her favorite poem by spoken word artist Alix Olson\u2014\u201dI\u2019ll give myself a lube job, shake my broomstick til my clit throbs\u201d\u2014she received a message to call Apple based on her usage of \u201cinappropriate language.\u201d\n\nIn Apple\u2019s defense, the Olson quote is fairly explicit, and it makes sense why the notoriously adult content-shy company would want to prevent consumers from inscribing pornographic language on their devices. But judging by the \u201cinappropriate language\u201d alert, Apple objected less to the general content of the quote than to the inclusion of the word \u201cclit\u201d\u2014an abbreviated version of a clinical term used to describe a part of the female anatomy.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The manufacturer will inscribe certain \"inappropriate language\" on your device.
