That adds up to $36,500 a year per employee up to a total of $500,000 in fines.\u201cIt\u2019s the biggest penalty that no one is talking about,\u201d said NFIB policy director Kevin Kuhlman. \u201cThe penalty for compensating employees for healthcare-related expenses is enough to destroy most small businesses.\u201dThe penalty will apply whether the reimbursement is a before-tax or after-tax contribution, according to Forbes , and the fine rises to more than 18 times greater than Obamacare\u2019s $2,000 employer-mandate penalty for an employer who does not provide health insurance for his or her employees.Some small businesses cannot afford to provide the health insurance plans that Obamacare endorses and, thus, the new fine punishes employers who do contribute to their employees\u2019 premium payments in their own individual or family health insurance policies, according to Forbes.\u201cIt\u2019s hard to believe Congress or the President intended to punish employers much more severely for actually helping their workers,\u201d Kuhlman said, according to NFIB. \u201cNevertheless, that\u2019s the consequence and most small businesses don\u2019t know it.\u201dKuhlman also told NFIB that, because small employers do not have HR departments or benefits specialists, reimbursing employees for the cost of their medical plans and services is both simpler and easier for many small businesses because it helps them to avoid the \u201cadministrative headache of setting up a costly group plan.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "small,
