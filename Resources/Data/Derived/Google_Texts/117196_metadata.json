Despite, or perhaps because of, his lugubrious cast of mind and deep affection for the power of the unhappy coincidence, film-makers and TV dramatists love him.\n\nThey also find him extraordinarily accommodating. The last time Hardy's Far From the Madding Crowd reached the screen, it came via a comic strip by the British graphic novelist Posy Simmonds. She made a strip out of it and Stephen Frears transformed that into a rustic modern-day screen comedy. Playing the lead was Gemma Arterton, star of Gemma Bovery, an adaptation of Simmonds' comic version of Gustave Flaubert's equally malleable Madame Bovary.\n\nBathsheba's (Carey Mulligan) proclivity for walking prettily across the landscape soon catches the eye of a potential suitor.

His film is faithful to the book as well as tossing up many reminders of John Schlesinger's much loved 1967 movie with Julie Christie as Hardy's heroine, Bathsheba Everdene.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCarey Mulligan has the gig this time and she's just as effective, which isn't easy. Bathsheba is quite a girl but she has her flaws. An independent spirit with a tidy inheritance, she feels entitled to flirt with any man she fancies while resolving never to marry. Then along comes the handsome Sergeant Troy (Tom Sturridge), a womanising show pony and inveterate gambler, and her brain goes into neutral while her libido takes over. Fortunately, this state of disarray doesn't persist much beyond the wedding night but its consequences cause a lot of long-lasting damage.\n\nIt all takes place in Wessex, Hardy's name for the green counties of England's south-west, where he set many of his novels, and Vinterberg seems at first an odd choice for such a quintessentially English story. With Lars von Trier, he was a founder of Dogme, Denmark's low-budget film-making movement which took off in the mid-1990s. He proved to be one of the movement's strongest talents, but his career has hit a few stumbling blocks along the way. It was The Hunt (2012), with its irresistibly melancholy performance by Mads Mikkelsen as a teacher unjustly accused of child abuse, which firmed up his international reputation. It also highlighted his ability to anatomise the politics of village living. Admittedly, it was a contemporary tale, but some things never change.\n\nWe first meet Bathsheba as a young girl yet to come into her inheritance. She's staying on her aunt's farm, where her habit of galloping prettily across the landscape on a suitably pretty horse soon attracts the eye of Gabriel Oak (Flemish actor Matthias Schoenaerts), the young farmer next door. He proposes, she declines and thanks to a typically Hardy-esque stroke of bad luck, he later loses his farm. A second, similarly spectacular coincidence then has him wind up as Bathsheba's hired hand on the property she eventually takes over. And so, he becomes the most stalwart of her three disparate suitors.\n\nThe local squire William Boldwood (Michael Sheen) also languishes after her and they're both appalled when the egregious Sergeant Troy comes swaggering on to the scene.\n\nHardy excels at marrying unlikely bits of plotting with completely credible snapshots of country life to devastating effect. With her disdain for convention, Bathsheba soon has poor Mr Boldwood, a bluff but hypersensitive character, thoroughly confused and she can be just as obtuse when it comes to her own feelings. They are soon plain to us. It's also very clear as to whom we should be cheering on. Schoenaerts, who proved a lacklustre lead in Alan Rickman's period piece A Little Chaos, atones for that failure with a performance which makes something very sexy out of loyalty combined with a quiet intelligence. The glances and banter that he and Bathsheba exchange over the daily chores even succeed in transforming hay-making and sheep-dipping into romantic pursuits.\n\nThere are a few jarring moments. One or two lines land with a clunky abruptness at odds with the prevailing mood and Sturridge veers dangerously close to becoming a moustache-twirling cartoon villain. As well, some of Australian designer Janet Patterson's costumes strike me as being too fussy for the routines of Victorian farming life. But I'm quibbling. All up, it's a classy and seductive example of the art of the intimate epic.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Movies", "application-name": "The Sydney Morning Herald", "og": {"site_name": "The Sydney Morning Herald", "description": "The latest version of Far from the Madding Crowd is classy and seductive.", "title": "Far From the Madding Crowd review: Carey Mulligan gets flirty in intimate epic", "url": "http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/movies/far-from-the-madding-crowd-review-carey-mulligan-gets-flirty-in-intimate-epic-20150615-gho2hm.html", "image": "http://images.smh.com.au/2015/06/22/6633402/th_maddingcrowd.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@smh", "card": "summary"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "Open The Sydney Morning Herald", "robots": "ACAP allow-present prohibited-modification=annotation", "fb": {"app_id": 193677504039845}, "cXenseParse": {"ffx-assettype": "article", "ffx-assetid": 997135258}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.smh.com.au", "msvalidate.01": "3A0F8B0A5D246EFE15A2F9F975D1E623", "msapplication-task": "name=Weather;action-uri=http://www.smh.com.au/weather;icon-uri=http://www.smh.com.au/favicon.ico;", "description": "The latest version of Far from the Madding Crowd is classy and seductive."}, "article_summary": "Reviewer rating: Rating: 4 out of 5 stars Reader rating: Rating: 2.5 out of 5 stars (8 votes)He may have been dead for 87 years but Thomas Hardy just keeps on keeping on.\nMoviesCarey Mulligan plays Bathsheba and Matthias Schoenaerts one of her suitors, Gabriel, in Far From the Madding Crowd.\nBathsheba's (Carey Mulligan) proclivity for walking prettily across the landscape soon catches the eye of a potential suitor.\nAll up, it's a classy and seductive example of the art of the intimate epic.\nAdvertisementCarey Mulligan has the gig this time and she's just as effective, which isn't easy."}
