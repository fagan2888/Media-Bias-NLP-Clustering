The day before, she went after her fellow Americans who aren't as fortunate as she to make the big bucks lying and smearing on television. Hasselbeck \u201casked,\" \u201cDo these folks really need to be on welfare?\u201d Then, after a clip of a few welfare recipients telling Fox\u2019s John Stossel that they have air conditioning and cable TV, she praised his reporting for \u201cexposing the ugly side of entitlements.\u201d\n\nSmearing the poor is a regular Fox News activity, as regular readers know. Clearly, Hasselbeck is fitting right in. With her dress hiked mid-thigh, she leaned forward and said eagerly to Stossel during the interview that followed, \u201cIf you\u2019re in 35 states, though, the actual \u2013 the minimum wage there is less than what you can make being on welfare. So the motivation to go get a job is almost non-existent.\u201d\n\nWe have already debunked that particular fiction. But even if she were telling the truth, it\u2019s revealing that Hasselbeck used it to suggest that welfare recipients get too much money (for nothing). Nobody mentioned that, as News Hound Christopher put it in his post on the subject, the stat could be \u201can indictment of our abysmal minimum wage, which has depreciated over time both in real dollars and in payment per productivity.\u201d\n\nCo-host Steve Doocy and Stossel piled on. \u201cOnce upon a time there was some shame to it,\u201d Doocy said, referring to accepting government assistance.\n\nStossel added, \u201cI joined the chorus that said, \u2018It\u2019s not right that these people, who through no fault of their own need help and we\u2019re shaming them. That\u2019s terrible.\u2019 But it\u2019s grown from that to this entitlement.\u201d\n\nApparently, Fox News is longing for those good old days when we can go back to shaming and smearing people in need and be proud of it!", "article_metadata": {"csrf-param": "authenticity_token", "google-site-verification": "google51c0b549f514d464.html", "csrf-token": "KtRVZvu9PoYtGCsKr2F6/Zs39flT49b3rKXHQhPygTY=", "og": {"url": "http://www.newshounds.us/elisabeth_hasselbeck_air_conditioning_and_cell_phones_are_the_ugly_side_of_welfare_10112013", "site_name": "NewsHounds", "image": "http://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/newshounds/sites/1/meta_images/original/Newshound3_blue.png?1327001871", "type": "article", "title": "Elisabeth Hasselbeck: Air Conditioning And Cell Phones Are The \u2018Ugly Side\u2019 Of Welfare"}, "Title": "Elisabeth Hasselbeck: Air Conditioning And Cell Phones Are The \u2018Ugly Side\u2019 Of Welfare"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0baf\"", "article_summary": "I posted earlier about how Elisabeth Hasselbeck cast truth aside in order to attack President Obama and fear monger about Obamacare last night.\nBut even if she were telling the truth, it\u2019s revealing that Hasselbeck used it to suggest that welfare recipients get too much money (for nothing).\nThe day before, she went after her fellow Americans who aren't as fortunate as she to make the big bucks lying and smearing on television.\nClearly, Hasselbeck is fitting right in.\nStossel added, \u201cI joined the chorus that said, \u2018It\u2019s not right that these people, who through no fault of their own need help and we\u2019re shaming them."}
