Another victory for Leicester in its bid to become the English Premier League\u2019s most unlikely champion.\n\nHours after seeing fellow title rivals Tottenham and Arsenal draw 2-2 in the north London derby, Leicester beat Watford 1-0 away to extend its lead to five points with just nine games remaining.\n\nMahrez grabbed the winner with his 15th goal of the season, controlling the ball at the edge of the area, feinting to give himself extra room, and curling an exquisite shot into the top corner in the 56th minute. It was the 11th away goal scored by the Algeria winger, who could yet complete a breakthrough season at soccer\u2019s highest level by winning England\u2019s Player of the Year award.\n\nA team that was almost relegated last season is showing no sign of slowing up in its charge to the title. The same cannot be said of the other contenders.\n\n\u201cIt is one game at a time \u2014 that\u2019s got us where we are today,\u201d Leicester goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel said. \u201cIf we get too far ahead of ourselves, we risk blowing it.\u201d\n\nAlexis Sanchez scored a 76th-minute equalizer to earn 10-man Arsenal a point against Spurs, meaning both sides dropped two points on Leicester. Leicester has 60 points, Tottenham has 55 and Arsenal has 52.\n\nFourth-place Manchester City is the other team with a realistic chance of hauling in Leicester and a 4-0 win over Aston Villa ended a run of three straight losses. Sergio Aguero scored two of the four second-half goals and struck the post with a penalty to miss out on a hat trick.\n\nWest Ham scored three goals in the final 12 minutes to rally to a 3-2 win at Everton and keep in touch with the top four, which could now be out of reach for Chelsea after the soon-to-be-deposed champions drew 1-1 at home to Stoke.\n\nNewcastle and Norwich both lost to stay in the relegation zone, with Newcastle manager Steve McClaren\u2019s position likely under severe pressure following the team\u2019s 3-1 home defeat to Bournemouth.\n\n\u201cNo, no way,\u201d said McClaren, when asked if he was going to quit. \u201cThat\u2019s for other people to decide. I don\u2019t do that.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Mahrez magic puts Leicester 5 points clear in Premier League", "title": "Mahrez magic puts Leicester 5 points clear in Premier League", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Mahrez magic puts Leicester 5 points clear in Premier League", "title": "Mahrez magic puts Leicester 5 points clear in Premier League", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2016/03/05/mahrez_magic_puts_leicester_5_points_clear_in_premier_league/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/03/britain-soccer-premier-league.jpeg6-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Mahrez magic puts Leicester 5 points clear in Premier League", "title": "Mahrez magic puts Leicester 5 points clear in Premier League", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/03/britain-soccer-premier-league.jpeg6-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Steve Douglas", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Leicester has 60 points, Tottenham has 55 and Arsenal has 52.\nAnother victory for Leicester in its bid to become the English Premier League\u2019s most unlikely champion.\n\u201cIt is one game at a time \u2014 that\u2019s got us where we are today,\u201d Leicester goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel said.\nIt was the 11th away goal scored by the Algeria winger, who could yet complete a breakthrough season at soccer\u2019s highest level by winning England\u2019s Player of the Year award.\nHours after seeing fellow title rivals Tottenham and Arsenal draw 2-2 in the north London derby, Leicester beat Watford 1-0 away to extend its lead to five points with just nine games remaining."}
