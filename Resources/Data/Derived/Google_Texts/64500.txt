Now that President Obama’s oft-repeated claim that Obamacare lets people keep their current health insurance has been exposed as false, it’s a good time to examine Politifact’s track record on the matter. It isn’t good.

In six separate columns addressing the Obama claim’s truthfulness between 2008 and 2012, the Tampa Bay Times’ influential fact-checking group did not once correctly label it as false.

This was despite ample evidence to the contrary — often noted in those same columns. Their harshest judgments were that his promise was “half true.” Even those rulings were grudging.

The first of these six Politifact columns ran Oct. 7, 2008, and evaluated Obama's comment, “[I]f you've got a health care plan that you like, you can keep it.” It rated this as “true” since Obama was “accurately describing his [then-proposed] health care plan.”

In other words, it was grading him on the basis of “Did he really promise this?” and not the more relevant “Is this a plausible promise?”

Politifact followed up on Aug. 11, 2009, when Obama said: “If you like your health care plan, you can keep your health care plan.”

This time there was legislation to evaluate and Politifact conceded: “It's not realistic for Obama to make blanket statements that ‘you’ will be able to ‘keep your health care plan.’ ”

That would undermine Obama’s claim, right? Not according to Politifact, which stated: “[O]ne of the points of reform is to change the way health care works right now. So we rate Obama's statement Half True.”

That may have been “one of the points of reform” but that was not relevant to Obama's claim. Politifact was simply moving the goalposts.
