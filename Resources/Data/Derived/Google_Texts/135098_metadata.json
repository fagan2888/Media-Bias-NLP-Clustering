All the good things are good,\u201d) confirming that the new miniseries will be six episodes long, shot in Vancouver, and, in terms of content, will probably \u201cbegin and end with the mythology.\u201d\n\nHe also spoke candidly about the show\u2019s unique appeal when it aired, particularly in how it balanced the case of the week element with serialized storytelling that build up a mythology over time. \u201cIt kind of introduced specialized knowledge, though you didn\u2019t have to do homework to watch the show,\u201d explained Duchovny. \u201cThey were always kind of juggling about what people needed to know, especially when we made the movies. Can we get somebody in who\u2019s never seen this? And I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll have to juggle that again with this iteration of it.\u201d\n\nAsked why he, Gillian Anderson and creator Chris Carter had decided to do the reboot now, Duchovny explained it was simply a matter of having finally got their act together to do it. \u201cIn terms of culturally or what people want to see, I don\u2019t know,\u201d he added. \u201cI imagine if we waited too much longer people would eventually lose interest. It\u2019s different from something like \u201cStar Trek,\u201d which started out campy and then, especially with the J.J. Abrams stuff, became legit somehow. You might argue with me, but I always felt like we were legit. We\u2019re still trying to do the same show. It\u2019s not like were trying to make it 2.0, or whatever the .0 is now. 3.0. We\u2019re gonna make the same show. But it\u2019ll be interesting because Gillian and I are older. I don\u2019t want to act like it\u2019s 20 years ago.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The actor spoke to the New York Times about the forthcoming \"X-Files\" reboot", "title": "David Duchovny: Fox Mulder is \u201cthe worst F.B.I. agent of all time\u201d", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The actor spoke to the New York Times about the forthcoming \"X-Files\" reboot", "title": "David Duchovny: Fox Mulder is \u201cthe worst F.B.I. agent of all time\u201d", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/03/27/david_duchovny_fox_mulder_is_the_worst_f_b_i_agent_of_all_time/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/02/david_duchovny.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The actor spoke to the New York Times about the forthcoming \"X-Files\" reboot", "title": "David Duchovny: Fox Mulder is \u201cthe worst F.B.I. agent of all time\u201d", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/02/david_duchovny.jpg", "creator": "@annaesilman", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Anna Silman", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, david duchovny, x-files", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Duchovny was happy to respond to questions about the much-anticipated reboot (as he put it, \u201cI haven\u2019t been hiding.\nTopics: david duchovny, x-files, Entertainment NewsThe New York Times got lucky (luckier than we did, anyway), having the good fortune to schedule a Q&A with David Duchovny about his new NBC period crime drama \u201cAquarius\u201d right as the news about the new \u201cX-Files\u201d reboot broke.\n\u201cIt kind of introduced specialized knowledge, though you didn\u2019t have to do homework to watch the show,\u201d explained Duchovny.\n\u201cThey were always kind of juggling about what people needed to know, especially when we made the movies.\nIt\u2019s different from something like \u201cStar Trek,\u201d which started out campy and then, especially with the J.J.
