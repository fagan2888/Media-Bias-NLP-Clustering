It was a late Saturday in April when a tornado touched down in Oaklawn and Southeast Wichita. The tornado hit the Pinaire mobile home park hard. 92 mobile homes were destroyed.

Spirit Aerosystems was also in the path of the storm. The plant suffered extensive damage and had to shut down for a week while repairs were made. The storm caused 146 million dollars in damage in Sedgwick County.

The Oaklawn tornado was part of a day long storm system across the plains and midwest that left six people dead.
