Bernie Sanders (I-Vermont) and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush (R) agree on one thing: The government should do what it can to help part-time workers find full time jobs.\n\nAnd Bush is finding a number of seemingly unlikely backers on both sides of the political spectrum, as national Democrats have tried to pounce on his Wednesday comments as a gaffe.\n\nIn an interview on CNN on Friday, Sanders said that he agreed with the basic premise of Bush's call to help part-time workers seek full-time jobs.\n\n\"Of course we need full-time jobs rather than part-time jobs,\" Sanders said.\n\n\"If he is talking about the need for more full-time jobs than part time jobs, that's absolutely correct,\" Sanders said.\n\nThe flap came after Bush proposed increasing economic output by increasing worker participation, helping part-time workers get full-time work and helping Americans who have dropped out of the workforce find jobs. Democrats have tried to use the comments \u2014 Bush said growing the economy would require Americans to \"work more hours\" \u2014 to say he's \"out of touch.\"\n\n\"To the extent that he was talking about moving involuntarily part timers into full-time jobs, I agree!\" Jared Bernstein, the former chief economist and economic adviser to Vice President Joe Biden, told Business Insider on Thursday.\n\nA number of conservative writers who don't always see eye to eye with Bush have also rallied to his defense. The National Review's Ramesh Ponnuru, who wrote that Bush shouldn't run for president, wrote Thursday that journalists and Democrats attacking Bush were \"distorting his comments out of misunderstanding or bad faith.\"\n\n\n\n\"Liberals may disagree with Bush\u2019s implicit policy prescriptions on work,\" he wrote. \"But they should not distort what he is saying, which is that government policies should be changed so that they do less to discourage work and more to encourage it. That is not the same as proposing a return of workhouses (or worse). It\u2019s not the same as telling people that their economic problems are the result of their laziness.\"\n\n\n\nPhil Kerpen, the president of the group American Commitment, blasted Clinton's criticism in a tweet Thursday:\n\nSome of the people @JebBush wants to get their hours back. @HillaryClinton is opposed.https://t.co/neApvkCEpF \u2014 Phil Kerpen (@kerpen) July 9, 2015\n\nAnd The Washington Examiner's Byron York, who has criticized Bush on items like the Iraq war and Obamacare, retweeted a story from FiveThirtyEight backing up Bush's worker claim:\n\nRT @FiveThirtyEight: .@JebBush was right: Americans need to work longer hours. http://t.co/GhtEShyfoS pic.twitter.com/TEstAHduNE \u2014 Byron York (@ByronYork) July 9, 2015\n\nOf course, for some of the unlikely allies, that's about where the policy similarities end. In Friday's CNN interview, Sanders said that simply pushing people to work longer hours was wrong and created a poor standard of living.\n\n\"But I want to reiterate: our people work today the longest hours of any people in any industrialized country,\" Sanders said. \"What we need to do is raise wages and income, not force our people who are already stressed out to work more hours.\"\n\nThough Sanders was somewhat reserved in his comments about Bush on Friday, his Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton didn't take the same approach on Thursday, launching into an attack and sub-tweeting Bush with a chart showing Americans' productivity.\n\nAnyone who believes Americans aren't working hard enough hasn't met enough American workers. pic.twitter.com/wyS1p8zcDo \u2014 Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) July 9, 2015\n\nBush quickly fired back.\n\nAnyone who discounts 6.5 million people stuck in part-time work & seeking full-time jobs hasnt listened to working Americans @hillaryclinton \u2014 Jeb Bush (@JebBush) July 9, 2015\n\nBush's claim that increasing hours will spur economic growth is correct \u2014 raising the number of hours worked would increase economic productivity.\n\nBut the spat does highlight an essential policy difference between the two parties. While Bush wants to implement policies that will power his somewhat unprecedented 4% GDP growth goal, Democrats are focused on economic policies that keep one eye on quality-of-life programs.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#185f7c", "sailthru.author": "Brett LoGiurato", "application-name": "Business Insider", "twitter": {"description": "Foes become friends.", "creator": "maxwelltani", "url": "http://www.businessinsider.com/bernie-sanders-jeb-bush-conservatives-2015-7", "image": "http://static4.businessinsider.com/image/559fd057ecad04cc1ef7425b-506-253/bernie-sanders-and-a-lot-of-unlikely-allies-are-backing-up-jeb-bush-about-part-time-workers.jpg", "title": "Bernie Sanders and a lot of unlikely allies are backing up Jeb Bush about part-time workers", "site": "bi_politics", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.verticals": "politics", "linkedin": {"owner": "mid:1d5f7b"}, "sailthru.tags": "Bernie Sanders, Jeb Bush, Hillary Clinton, 2016 Elections, Maxwell Tani, Brett LoGiurato", "description": "Foes become friends.", "author": "Maxwell Tani and Brett LoGiurato", "sailthru.date": "2015-07-10", "sailthru.title": "Bernie Sanders and a lot of unlikely allies are backing up Jeb Bush about part-time workers", "theme-color": "#185f7c", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://static1.businessinsider.com/image/559e0f9deab8ead120ab062e-50-50/bernie-sanders-and-a-lot-of-unlikely-allies-are-backing-up-jeb-bush-about-part-time-workers.jpg", "news_keywords": "Bernie Sanders, Jeb Bush, Hillary Clinton, 2016 Elections, Maxwell Tani, Brett LoGiurato", "tbi-image": "http://static3.businessinsider.com/image/559e0f9deab8ead120ab062e/bernie-sanders-and-a-lot-of-unlikely-allies-are-backing-up-jeb-bush-about-part-time-workers.jpg", "fb": {"app_id": 155043519637}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://static1.businessinsider.com/assets/images/us/favicons/mstile-144x144.png?v=BI-US-2016-03-31", "date": "2015-07-10", "article": {"publisher": "businessinsider", "author": "http://www.businessinsider.com/author/brett-logiurato"}, "sailthru.description": "Foes become friends.", "viewport": "width=1024", "og": {"site_name": "Business Insider", "description": "Foes become friends.", "title": "Bernie Sanders and a lot of unlikely allies are backing up Jeb Bush about part-time workers", "url": "http://www.businessinsider.com/bernie-sanders-jeb-bush-conservatives-2015-7", "image": "http://static2.businessinsider.com/image/559fd057ecad04cc1ef7425b-1190-625/bernie-sanders-and-a-lot-of-unlikely-allies-are-backing-up-jeb-bush-about-part-time-workers.jpg", "type": "article"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Business Insider", "title": "Bernie Sanders and a lot of unlikely allies are backing up Jeb Bush about part-time workers", "sailthru.image.full": "http://static3.businessinsider.com/image/559e0f9deab8ead120ab062e/bernie-sanders-and-a-lot-of-unlikely-allies-are-backing-up-jeb-bush-about-part-time-workers.jpg", "tbi-vertical": "politics"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd15e9\"", "article_summary": "\"Of course we need full-time jobs rather than part-time jobs,\" Sanders said.\n\"If he is talking about the need for more full-time jobs than part time jobs, that's absolutely correct,\" Sanders said.\nJeb Bush (R) agree on one thing: The government should do what it can to help part-time workers find full time jobs.\nIn an interview on CNN on Friday, Sanders said that he agreed with the basic premise of Bush's call to help part-time workers seek full-time jobs.\n\"To the extent that he was talking about moving involuntarily part timers into full-time jobs, I agree!\""}
