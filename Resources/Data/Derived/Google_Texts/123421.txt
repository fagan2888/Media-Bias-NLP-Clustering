Kaiser Permanente has banned the use of 13 antimicrobial chemicals and elements added to fabrics, furniture and finishes in its building projects going forward, according to an Oct. 13 bulletin. Officials of the health system, with 38 hospitals and 619 medical offices and outpatient facilities, state that this latest move is part of an overall mission to make its facilities healthier for patients and staff.

The decision, which follows a commitment Kaiser made last year to remove furniture containing toxic flame-retardent chemicals from its facilities, is not retroactive and affects only Kaiserâ€™s future projects, and current construction and renovation projects that are not yet in the purchasing phase.

John Kouletsis, vice president for facilities planning and design at Kaiser Permanente, says the health system has informed the architects, general contractors and suppliers with whom it works that it will no longer purchase products and building materials that include fabric and finishes treated with antimicrobial additives.
