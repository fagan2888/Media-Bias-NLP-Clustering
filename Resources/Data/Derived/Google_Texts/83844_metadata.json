Democrats in the House and Senate have enough votes to block an override by the Republican majority.\n\nThe House passed the repeal measure Wednesday in a 240-181 vote, the most recent of several dozen votes that body has taken since Republicans won a majority in the 2010 elections. The Senate passed the measure in December.\n\nObama vetoed the bill shortly after it reached his desk.\n\nRepublican Celebration\n\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan said that \u201cit\u2019s no surprise that someone named Obama vetoed a bill repealing Obamacare\u201d and that lawmakers planned to hold an override vote.\n\n\u201cThe idea that Obamacare is the law of the land for good is a myth,\u201d the Wisconsin Republican said in a statement Friday. \u201cThis law will collapse under its own weight, or it will be repealed.\u201d\n\nIn his statement, Obama said his political opponents would take health care away from millions of people without offering a plan for how to replace the coverage. Citing estimates from his economic advisers, he said the repeal bill could cause \u201cpotentially more than 10,000 additional deaths\u201d annually.\n\n\u201cThis legislation would cost millions of hard-working middle-class families the security of affordable health coverage they deserve,\u201d he said. \u201cReliable health care coverage would no longer be a right for everyone\u2013it would return to being a privilege for a few.\u201d\n\n\u2018Death Spiral\u2019\n\nWhile retaining parts of the Affordable Care Act, the legislation would have eliminated penalties for not complying with its requirement that individuals and large employers buy insurance for themselves and their workers. The Obama administration contends that would encourage healthy policyholders to drop coverage, causing a \u201cdeath spiral\u201d of rate increases for less healthy people who retain their policies.\n\nThe bill also would have canceled, in 2018, the law\u2019s expansion of the federal-state Medicaid health program for the poor, as well as subsidies for people who buy insurance coverage through federal or state exchanges.\n\nBoth the individual mandate for insurance and the subsidies were subjected to Supreme Court challenges in 2012 and 2015 aimed at dismantling the law. After the court upheld the law, Republicans stepped up their efforts to repeal Obamacare through legislation.\n\n\u2018Big Ideas\u2019\n\nRepublicans celebrated the passage of the bill with an enrollment ceremony Thursday, with leaders saying it fulfilled a campaign promise to voters who gave them control of both bodies of Congress in the 2014 elections.\n\nRyan said sending the repeal bill to Obama\u2019s desk signaled the first of many \u201cbig ideas\u201d Republicans would be embracing this year in advance of November elections, to encourage voters to elect a Republican president.\n\n\u201cNext year, if we\u2019re sending this bill to a Republican president, it will get signed into law,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cObamacare will be gone.\u201d\n\nThe legislation passed Wednesday also would have denied federal money for Planned Parenthood, the reproductive health- care organization that Republicans have sought to de-fund since undercover videos purported to show its officials discussing reimbursement for providing tissue from aborted fetuses to medical researchers. Planned Parenthood said it received only the cost of providing the tissue, and it later stopped taking such payments.\n\nPlanned Parenthood receives about $450 million in federal funds annually, most of it through Medicaid coverage for healthcare services for the poor. A ban on federally funded abortions has been in place for decades. Bloomberg Philanthropies provides financial support for Planned Parenthood.\n\nAbout 17.6 million previously uninsured people have gained coverage under Affordable Care Act provisions including expanded Medicaid, marketplace insurance plans, and young people allowed to stay on their parents\u2019 plans through age 26, the Department of Health and Human Services estimated in September.\n\n\u2013With assistance from Kathleen Miller, Billy House and Zachary Tracer.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30;polling-uri=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.insurancejournal.com/rss/mostpopular/&polling-uri2=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.insurancejournal.com/rss/mostpopular/&id=2;polling-uri3=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.insurancejournal.com/rss/mostpopular/&id=3;polling-uri4=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.insurancejournal.com/rss/mostpopular/&id=4;polling-uri5=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.insurancejournal.com/rss/mostpopular/&id=5; cycle=1", "description": "President Barack Obama vetoed a measure to repeal most of his signature healthcare law on Friday, releasing a statement that extolled the virtues of his bi", "application-name": "Insurance Journal", "og": {"site_name": "Insurance Journal", "description": "President Barack Obama vetoed a measure to repeal most of his signature healthcare law on Friday, releasing a statement that extolled the virtues of his bi", "title": "Obama Vetoes Republicans' Repeal of Affordable Care Act", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://www.insurancejournal.com/img/insurancejournal-square.png", "url": "http://www.insurancejournal.com/news/national/2016/01/10/394554.htm", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "President Barack Obama vetoed a measure to repeal most of his signature healthcare law on Friday, releasing a statement that extolled the virtues of his bi", "title": "Obama Vetoes Republicans' Repeal of Affordable Care Act", "image": "https://www.insurancejournal.com/img/insurancejournal-square.png", "creator": "@ijournal", "site": "@ijournal", "card": "summary"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#B10000", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "/img/insurance-journal-tile-128x128.png", "robots": "noodp", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "/img/insurance-journal-tile-558x558.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "/img/insurance-journal-tile-558x270.png", "fb": {"page_id": 75524109257, "pages": 75524109257, "app_id": 106194681485}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/img/insurance-journal-tile-144x144.png", "msapplication-starturl": "/?utm_source=windows&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=windows-pinned-sites", "date": "2016-01-10", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/insurancejournal", "section": "National News", "tag": "obamacare repeal votes", "published_time": "2016-01-10T18:37:40-04:00"}, "msapplication-square150x150logo": "/img/insurance-journal-tile-270x270.png"}, "article_summary": "Citing estimates from his economic advisers, he said the repeal bill could cause \u201cpotentially more than 10,000 additional deaths\u201d annually.\n\u201cThis legislation would cost millions of hard-working middle-class families the security of affordable health coverage they deserve,\u201d he said.\nAfter the court upheld the law, Republicans stepped up their efforts to repeal Obamacare through legislation.\nThe veto ends, for now, any chance that the 2010 Affordable Care Act will be undone during Obama\u2019s presidency.\n\u201cReliable health care coverage would no longer be a right for everyone\u2013it would return to being a privilege for a few.\u201d\u2018Death Spiral\u2019While retaining parts of the Affordable Care Act, the legislation would have eliminated penalties for not complying with its requirement that individuals and large employers buy insurance for themselves and their workers."}
