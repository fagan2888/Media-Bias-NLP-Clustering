The annual Easter Egg Hunt in Highland Park brought in a crowd Saturday morning.

The park was packed with children of all ages searching for more than 4,000 hidden eggs. The hunt is sponsored by the Meridian Parks and Recreation Department each year, and they say it's always exciting for the kids.

"Oh, it's excitement in the air," recreation program supervisor Brandon Bridges says. "Spring weather's coming in, even though we had the seasonal snap that we're used to getting every year. But kids were very excited. They loved their prizes and had fun."

Some of the eggs contain candy and others had even bigger prizes. This year, the department increased the number of prizes, including a cash prize of over $100. A few kids even rolled away with a new set of wheels.
