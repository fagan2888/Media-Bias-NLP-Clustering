He was given a hero\u2019s welcome Saturday when he addressed a conference called by the ultra-right Heritage Action Center in South Carolina, where seven candidates for the Republican nomination appeared.\n\nOn \u201cMeet the Press\u201d the next day, Carson was asked by host Chuck Todd whether the religious views of the president were relevant to his fitness for office. \u201cIt depends on what that faith is,\u201d replied Carson, a practicing Seventh-Day Adventist who has based his campaign on appeals to Christian fundamentalists.\n\n\u201cIf it\u2019s inconsistent with the values and principles of America, then of course it should matter. But if it fits within the realm of America and consistent with the Constitution, no problem.\u201d\n\nTodd then asked whether Carson believed Islam is \u201cconsistent with the Constitution.\u201d The candidate responded, \u201cNo, I do not. I would not advocate that we put a Muslim in charge of this nation. I absolutely would not agree with that.\u201d\n\nCarson said he could potentially back a Muslim for the House of Representatives or US Senate. \u201cCongress is a different story,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it depends on who that Muslim is and what their policies are.\u201d Given that he had just declared Islam to be incompatible with the US Constitution, this \u201cconcession\u201d to Muslims only reveals the extreme shallowness of the political \u201cthinking\u201d underlying Carson\u2019s religious bigotry.\n\nTodd did not point out, although other commentators did subsequently, that Carson\u2019s opposition to a Muslim in the White House amounts to a flat rejection of the US Constitution\u2019s provisions on the separation of church and state.\n\nThis includes not only the First Amendment, which forbids the establishment of a state religion, but also the last paragraph of Article VI, which reads, in part, \u201cno religious test shall ever be required as a qualification to any office or public trust under the United States.\u201d\n\nMore than a half-century ago, John F. Kennedy, a Roman Catholic, cited Article VI in response to those who opposed his election on religious grounds. In his famous speech on September 12, 1960 to the Greater Houston Ministerial Association, Kennedy declared that he did not \u201clook with favor upon those who would work to subvert Article VI of the Constitution by requiring a religious test, even by indirection. For if they disagree with that safeguard, they should be openly working to repeal it.\u201d\n\nCarson\u2019s comments elicited a mixed reaction from his fellow Republican candidates. Billionaire Donald Trump, who leads in polls of Republican primary voters, gave the most cynical response. Asked the same question on \u201cMeet the Press\u201d about a possible Muslim president, he replied, \u201cSome people have said it already happened.\u201d\n\nThis was a reference to the longstanding ultra-right campaign claiming President Obama is a Muslim (together with the related claim that Obama was not born in the United States and is therefore not eligible to be president). Trump was the leading proponent of the so-called \u201cbirthers\u201d in the Republican Party, and he pandered to them again on Thursday.\n\n\u201cWe have a problem in this country. It\u2019s called Muslims,\u201d said a campaign supporter who stood up at a Trump rally. \u201cWe know our current president is one\u2014you know he\u2019s not even an American.\u201d\n\n\u201cRight,\u201d Trump responded.\n\nAfter media criticism that he had effectively agreed with the \u201cbirther\u201d by declining to correct him, Trump responded on Twitter that \u201cChristians need support in our country (and around the world), their religious liberty is at stake!\u201d\n\nActually, the Obama administration has cringed before the Christian fundamentalist right as well as the Roman Catholic hierarchy, seeking to appease them by excluding both churches and church-run charities and social services from provisions of the Affordable Care Act relating to contraception and abortion services.\n\nAnother Republican presidential hopeful, Kentucky Senator Rand Paul, rejected questioning whether Obama was a Christian and born in the United States, but expressed understanding for Carson\u2019s opposition to a Muslim president, citing the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. \u201cI just think that it\u2019s hard for us--we were attacked by people who are all Muslim,\u201d Paul said.\n\nCarson\u2019s attack on Article VI is only the latest in a series of increasingly flagrant attacks on the basic democratic precepts set down in the US Constitution and Bill of Rights.\n\nTrump set the pace with a public denunciation of the 14th Amendment\u2019s provision for \u201cbirthright citizenship,\u201d under which the children of immigrants who are born on US soil are automatically American citizens. Seven other Republican presidential hopefuls have endorsed this reactionary reinterpretation of the 14th Amendment, which Trump repeated during the Republican presidential debate September 16.\n\nTexas Senator Ted Cruz and former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee, among others, publicly declared their support for Kim Davis, the clerk of Rowan County, Kentucky, who defied a federal court order to begin issuing marriage licenses to gay couples. Asked what authority allowed her to override the US Supreme Court decision striking down state bans on gay marriage, she replied, \u201cGod\u2019s authority.\u201d\n\nThere was little discussion of the Davis case during last week\u2019s Republican debate, but at least half of the Republican presidential hopefuls have expressed sympathy for this theocratic view of the world, in which political office-holders are entitled to force their religious views on the public.\n\n\n\nThe author also recommends:\n\nRepublican candidates attack the Fourteenth Amendment\n\n[24 August 2015]\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.", "article_metadata": {"category": "us2016elections", "ranking": 32, "description": "Retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson, running second or third in polls of Republican presidential voters, said Sunday no Muslim should be allowed to become president of the United States.", "language": "en", "author": "Patrick Martin", "og": {"image": "http://www.wsws.org/img/open-graph-icon.png"}, "headline": "More bigotry from Republican presidential candidates", "keywords": "Republicans, Carson, Muslims, Sixth Amendment, Constitution, Davis, separation of church and state", "date": "2015-09-21", "id": "7e89df47-12f0-4332-968b-9d52791fdc3I"}, "article_summary": "Seven other Republican presidential hopefuls have endorsed this reactionary reinterpretation of the 14th Amendment, which Trump repeated during the Republican presidential debate September 16.\nMore bigotry from Republican presidential candidatesBy Patrick Martin21 September 2015One of the leading Republican presidential candidates declared Sunday that a Muslim should never be allowed to become president of the United States.\nFor if they disagree with that safeguard, they should be openly working to repeal it.\u201dCarson\u2019s comments elicited a mixed reaction from his fellow Republican candidates.\nThe author also recommends:Republican candidates attack the Fourteenth Amendment[24 August 2015]Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.\nHe was given a hero\u2019s welcome Saturday when he addressed a conference called by the ultra-right Heritage Action Center in South Carolina, where seven candidates for the Republican nomination appeared."}
