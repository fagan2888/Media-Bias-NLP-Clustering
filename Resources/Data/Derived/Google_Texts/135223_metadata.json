Short term medical plans are designed to provide medical coverage for consumers who find themselves temporarily without health insurance. IPA advisors enroll major medical coverage, short term medical and supplemental plans through a proprietary enrollment platform available at http://www.HealtheDeals.com.\n\nAccording to Brad Frazier, an advisor with IPA, \"The vast product line that the IPA Family offers, alongside the state-of-the-art technology to utilize and process clients\u2019 specific insurance solutions is in my view, second to none in the industry hands down.\"\n\n\u201cSignificant enhancement and ready access to Health eDeals has been a game-changer this year,\u201d said David Kettig, Chief Operating Officer of The IHC Group. \u201cIt has allowed our advisors to efficiently add on supplemental sales when there is a product need. For instance, our VIP series of major medical gap plans, which is only available through IPA advisors, can be added to a major medical plan enrolled on Health eDeals with just a few keystrokes, saving both the producer and the consumer valuable time.\u201d\n\nIHC recently committed to spending $1.5 million dollars on technology enhancements that will make it even easier and faster for advisors to enroll Obamacare and supplemental health plans. Mr. Kettig added, \u201cIHC\u2019s investment in innovation is on-going. While other carriers are considering pulling away entirely from health insurance, we are investing in becoming a market leader in providing much-needed, affordable ancillary coverages.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt IPA Family, we know that our success hinges on our ability to hire top producers and experienced sales leaders,\u201d added Mr. Keeler. \u201cTo that end, we have launched an enhancement to our new advisor program that provides recent hires a new service called Telephonic Concierge, which gives them sales support via phone, email or text message. We think that this new service will accelerate the career growth of our new hires and help us reach even more consumers during this open enrollment.\u201d\n\nFor more information on becoming an advisor with IPA-Family or to learn about health insurance products, please visit http://www.IPAFamily.com, and connect on @IPAFamily on Facebook, LinkedIn and follow @IPA_Family on Twitter for latest updates.\n\n#\n\nAbout The IHC Group\n\nThe IHC Group is an organization of insurance carriers and marketing and administrative affiliates that has been providing life, health, disability, medical stop-loss and specialty insurance solutions to groups and individuals for over 30 years.
