Faried didn\u2019t play in the fourth quarter. But that wasn\u2019t because of punishment, coach Michael Malone said. Faried asked to be taken out of the game.\n\n\u201cSecond half, he asked to come out,\u201d Malone said. \u201cI\u2019m not sure if he wasn\u2019t feeling well, I\u2019m not sure what it was. But when your starting power forward has one rebound in 13 minutes, and you get outrebounded by 12, that\u2019s obviously an issue.\u201d\n\nThe last time Faried didn\u2019t score in a game was Feb. 3, 2015. He went 0-for-6 from the field in a loss to Philadelphia.\n\n\u201cKenneth got into early foul trouble, got two quick ones (and I) took him out,\u201d Malone said. \u201cIn the second half, we cut it to five in the third quarter and he asked to come out. Wasn\u2019t feeling well, I\u2019m not sure. That\u2019s the reason he played the limited minutes.\u201d\n\nNot sticking to script. Malone warned the Nuggets that the Celtics are specialists in getting opponents to turn the ball over.\n\nNuggets Mailbag: Pose a question for Christopher Dempsey\n\nHis players took that information for granted, and the Celtics made them pay.\n\nThe Nuggets\u2019 24 turnovers Sunday tied their season high. It was the sixth time this season they had 20 or more.\n\n\u201cWhen you give them 24 turnovers for 29 points, and that leads to their 24 fast- break points, that\u2019s a huge problem,\u201d Malone said.\n\nFootnotes. Jameer Nelson (wrist) missed his eighth straight game. \u2026 The Nuggets were swept by Boston for the second consecutive season.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Nuggets forward Kenneth Faried no help against Celtics", "title": "Nuggets forward Kenneth Faried no help against Celtics", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/02/21/nuggets-forward-kenneth-faried-no-help-against-celtics/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160205__9a202ce2b3fba5068f0f6a706700f909p1.jpg", "height": 516}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160205__9a202ce2b3fba5068f0f6a706700f909p1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2016-02-21T22:06:52+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-18T02:37:10+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Veteran forward Kenneth Faried was among the Nuggets who struggled to get things going in Sunday\u2019s game against the Boston Celtics.\n\u201cWhen you give them 24 turnovers for 29 points, and that leads to their 24 fast- break points, that\u2019s a huge problem,\u201d Malone said.\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure if he wasn\u2019t feeling well, I\u2019m not sure what it was.\nMalone warned the Nuggets that the Celtics are specialists in getting opponents to turn the ball over.\nNuggets Mailbag: Pose a question for Christopher DempseyHis players took that information for granted, and the Celtics made them pay."}
