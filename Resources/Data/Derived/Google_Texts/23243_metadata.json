Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush is \u201cactively\u201d exploring a possible 2016 candidacy. Needless to say, conservatives aren\u2019t happy. Sen. Rand Paul has already begun attacking Bush, but the former governor is convinced he\u2019s a mainstream conservative. Yet, his potential candidacy looks fragile\u2013even more so than Mitt Romney. Bush supports Common Core, immigration reform, walks a waffled path on climate change, and is sort of open to tax increases.\n\n\u201cIf you could bring to me a majority of people to say that we\u2019re going to have $10 of spending cuts for $1 of revenue enhancement \u2014 put me in, Coach,\u201d he once said in 2012. Bush gave his answer on a hypothetical budget deal at a congressional hearing, which had spending cuts and tax increases.\n\nAgain, more than a few Republicans might find this as rational, but to the base\u2013this is anathema. He also never signed Grover Norquist\u2019s pledge to oppose tax increases.\n\nIn Politico, they wrote how Cato Institute found that government spending increased 45 percent under his administration, though Bush\u2019s allies claim the uptick was due to disastrous weather the struck the Sunshine State during his tenure. Yet, the piece also pointed out some of Jeb\u2019s strong points as well:\n\nIt\u2019s not that any of the friction from the right is a surprise to Bush. Even though his allies say he did, in fact, have a conservative record as Florida governor \u2014 cutting taxes by $19.3 billion, building the state\u2019s reserves to $9 billion and streamlining regulations \u2014 they say his statement about \u201closing the primary to win the general\u201d was meant to signal that he\u2019s not going to change to please the right. \u2026 In some respects, Bush would be an unlikely candidate to be accused of being soft of tax increases. As governor, he cut levies on businesses, investments, large estates and homes. \u2026 Campbell [Spokesperson Kristy Campbell] says Bush \u201cdoes not support tax increases\u201d and that \u201chis record on fiscal issues is clear,\u201d especially with his deep cuts in Florida. And not all conservative activists have a problem with Bush\u2019s record. The conservative Club for Growth said it is willing to hear Bush out, saying it could abide tax increases if they got major spending cuts or an overhaul of the Tax Code in return.\n\nThe article also mentioned that Bush supports repealing Obamacare and replacing it with a Republican alternative. Yet, he\u2019s critical of the defunding strategy to undercut the law. On climate change, Mr. Bush has positioned himself as a skeptic, but warned how this issue could make Republicans look \u201canti-science.\u201d\n\nHis embrace of Common Core will surely rub conservatives the wrong way\u2013and he\u2019s made no indication that he would compromise to suck up to the right of the Republican Party.\n\nAs the Wall Street Journal wrote back in June, he was warned by an aide to avoid referencing Common Core at the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC) in 2013, he simply said, \u201cI respect those that don't agree with me,\" he told the group gathered in Chicago. \"What I can't accept are dumbing [sic] down standards and expectations.\"\n\nLast April, he told Fox News, \"I just don't feel compelled to run for cover when I think this is the right thing to do for our country. And others have, others that supported the standards all of a sudden are opposed to it.\"\n\nTo be fair, Common Core isn\u2019t the brainchild of the left:\n\nCreated by a bipartisan group of governors and adopted by 45 states and the District of Columbia, Common Core was designed to boost academic achievement and allow for comparisons across states. One goal was to hand power back to the states to implement standards called for in President George W. Bush's No Child Left Behind law. But after President Barack Obama tied the disbursal of federal education grants to states adopting Common Core, conservatives revolted.\n\nSo, Jeb has some advantages; he doesn\u2019t like Obamacare; he\u2019s pro-life; he cut taxes as governor; and he\u2019s leading in the polls, but that\u2019s without Romney being factored into the equation.\n\nStill, to quote A&E\u2019s Storage Wars, there\u2019s no \u201cwow\u201d factor with Bush. If anything, he\u2019s like Mitt Romney, but only with a backbone.\n\nRegardless, this looks like a campaign that can quickly venture towards rocky shoals.\n\nOn immigration, Bush said, \u201cyes, they [illegal immigrants] broke the law, but it\u2019s not a felony. It\u2019s an act of love, it\u2019s an act of commitment to your family.\u201d He also supports background checks at gun shows, which isn\u2019t going bode well with the NRA.\n\nThe Democrats are already trying to find dirty laundry belonging to any potential Republican in the 2016 crop. While American Bridge, which compiled a 900+ page opposition research paper on Romney in 2012, noted that Jeb could fundraise well. Yet, his work with Lehman Brothers and Barclays could reopen old wounds from the Bush administration. Whether we like it or not, the financial collapse happened in the twilight of Bush\u2019s second term. That\u2019s the sticking point. Bush\u2019s presidency grappled with the financial industry\u2019s potential demise, which led to the passage TARP. It also helped Obama trounce McCain 2008, which led to the stimulus in 2009. The Bush name is roped in with one of the worst economic recessions in recent memory and TARP. The latter of which is also anathema to the Tea Party.\n\nThen again, National Journal noted that such dealings with Lehman and Barclays is relatively unknown. If there\u2019s something, it will be made public. The article noted that Florida has good public-record keeping laws\u2013and Jeb would release 250,000 emails during his time as governor. This all could be one huge nothing burger regarding Jeb\u2019s work in the financial sector. And if he\u2019s as certain about sticking to his guns about Common Core, it\u2019s probably something\u2013in Jeb\u2019s view\u2013that he feels won\u2019t be as bad as the Democrats\u2019 flaying of Romney via Bain Capital.\n\nCharles Cooke over at National Review wrote a piece on why Jeb is not our guy in 2016. He also cited the Lehman-Bush obstacle as well:\n\nAs it stands, the Republican party has not won a presidential election without a Bush on the top of the ticket since 1984, and it has not won the presidency without a Bush somewhere on the ticket since 1972. If Jeb were elected president, it would be the case that, for three decades, one family had been in charge of the country each and every time the electorate moved in its party\u2019s direction. What, I wonder, would that say about conservatism? And what, I wonder, would it say about America writ large if, 36 years after George H. W. was first sworn in as vice president, the Right concluded that the only way that it could credibly win power was to tap into the same, oft-pumped well?\n\nDynastic objections aside, it strikes me also that Jeb is almost perfectly wrong for this moment in American history. Without doubt, he is a talented, upstanding, and accomplished man, and he would probably do an admirable job if he parachuted into power. But, this being hardball democratic politics, and not the Biography Channel, there are many, many more questions for us to consider. In 2012, a weak President Obama not only managed to draw an astonishing amount of blood simply by riffing on Mitt Romney\u2019s remarkable business career, but, with a little help from Newt Gingrich and Rick Perry, was able to adroitly leverage the still-tender memories of the recent financial collapse and to paint his opponent as a detached, Gilded Age demon. Presumably, Bush would get precisely the same treatment. Just a few months ago, he teamed up with a bunch of Wall Street bankers and started a private-equity fund that will specialize in oil and gas. A few years ago, moreover, he worked with Lehman Brothers until, in the heat of the 2008 financial crisis that is still largely blamed on his brother, it collapsed in ignominious disgrace. Fair or unfair, what exactly do we imagine the story will be if the next Republican candidate is not only vulnerable in this area in his own right, but has the surname \u201cBush\u201d to boot?\n\nAlso, history is against Bush. He possibly waited too long to mount a serious run for the White House. When 2016 comes around, the gap between Jeb's last successful election (2002) and 2016 will be 14 years. The last president that had the same gap in time between his last winning campaign and clinching the presidency was 150 years ago with Abraham Lincoln. His last victorious campaign before winning the presidential election of 1860 was his 1846 congressional run.", "article_metadata": {"description": "He won't suck up to conservatives to win..05/25/2016 19:33:23PM EST.", "author": "Matt Vespa", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "He won't suck up to conservatives to win.", "title": "Matt Vespa - RINO Hunting: Policy and History Are Against Jeb Bush", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/mattvespa/2014/12/18/rino-hunting-policy-and-history-are-against-jeb-bush-n1933627", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2014/350/2014-12-16T154137Z_2_LYNXMPEABF0RC_RTROPTP_3_USA-BUSINESS.JPG", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "He won't suck up to conservatives to win.", "title": "Matt Vespa - RINO Hunting: Policy and History Are Against Jeb Bush", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/mattvespa/2014/12/18/rino-hunting-policy-and-history-are-against-jeb-bush-n1933627", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2014/350/2014-12-16T154137Z_2_LYNXMPEABF0RC_RTROPTP_3_USA-BUSINESS.JPG", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "RINO Hunting: Policy and History Are Against Jeb Bush, Matt Vespa, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdec4a\"", "article_summary": "Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush is \u201cactively\u201d exploring a possible 2016 candidacy.\nBush supports Common Core, immigration reform, walks a waffled path on climate change, and is sort of open to tax increases.\nTo be fair, Common Core isn\u2019t the brainchild of the left:Created by a bipartisan group of governors and adopted by 45 states and the District of Columbia, Common Core was designed to boost academic achievement and allow for comparisons across states.\nBut after President Barack Obama tied the disbursal of federal education grants to states adopting Common Core, conservatives revolted.\nBush gave his answer on a hypothetical budget deal at a congressional hearing, which had spending cuts and tax increases."}
