And each were evident that the Broncos\u2019 offense is still working out the kinks in Gary Kubiak\u2019s zone-blocking system.\n\nManning played under center more Saturday than he did in his preseason debut against Houston. But the timing and rhythm with his receivers and tight ends were off. He overthrew Cory Latimer up the middle, and then underthrew Demaryius Thomas in the end zone on the opening drive.\n\nAnd on a later drive, Manning had tight end Owen Daniels out wide, but the pass, again, fell short.\n\nThe offense wasn\u2019t without bright spots, though. More snaps for the starters meant more time for C.J. Anderson to run the ball.\n\nAnd run, he did.\n\nIn the first half, Anderson had 49 yards on 13 carries, the longest of which was 13 yards.\n\nOn the other side, the first-team defense continued to impress. Von Miller sacked Colin Kaepernick 29 seconds into San Francisco\u2019s opening drive. Then Ware added another sack \u2014 in San Francisco\u2019s end zone for the safety.\n\nThe first-team defense has yet to allow a touchdown this preseason. And Kaepernick failed to complete a pass in the first half.\n\nROSTER CHANGES\n\nPlayers not playing for Broncos: Emmanuel Sanders (hamstring), Chris Harris (hamstring), Tony Carter, Lerentee McCray (multiple injuries), Evan Mathis, Jeff Heuerman (ACL), Dan Light (waiver claim), Kenny Anunike (knee).\n\nStarting lineup changes for Broncos: Max Garcia to start at left guard for Mathis. Cody Latimer to start at wide reciever for Sanders. Bradley Roby to start at right cornerback for Harris.\n\nPlayers not playing for 49ers: Cornerback Tramaine Brock, linebacker Philip Wheeler, linebacker Desmond Bishop, tight end Vance McDonald.\n\nKEY UPCOMING DATES\n\n\u2022 Sept. 1 (2 p.m.): Roster cut to maximum 75 players\n\n\u2022 Sept. 5 (2 p.m.): Roster cut to maximum 53 players\n\n\u2022 Sept. 6 (11 a.m.): Up to 10 players selected to practice squad\n\n\u2022 Sept. 13 (2:25 p.m.): Regular-season opener vs. Baltimore at Sports Authority Field\n\nNicki Jhabvala: njhabvala@denverpost.com or twitter.com/nickijhabvala", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Peyton Manning, Broncos\u2019 offense struggle in first half vs. 49ers; run game, defense solid", "title": "Peyton Manning, Broncos\u2019 offense struggle in first half vs. 49ers; run game, defense solid", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/08/29/peyton-manning-broncos-offense-struggle-in-first-half-vs-49ers-run-game-defense-solid/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150829__SP19BRONCOS49ERSTR2_0498xp1.jpg", "height": 467}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150829__SP19BRONCOS49ERSTR2_0498xp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-08-29T10:44:12+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-22T08:05:50+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc1b2\"", "article_summary": "Players not playing for 49ers: Cornerback Tramaine Brock, linebacker Philip Wheeler, linebacker Desmond Bishop, tight end Vance McDonald.\nAnd on a later drive, Manning had tight end Owen Daniels out wide, but the pass, again, fell short.\nAgainst the 49ers in the Broncos\u2019 third preseason game of the season, Peyton Manning helped the Broncos to an 8-3 lead at the half but was sacked three times along the way.\nThe last time Manning was sacked that many times was in October 2013, when he was taken down four times at Indianapolis.\nAnd each were evident that the Broncos\u2019 offense is still working out the kinks in Gary Kubiak\u2019s zone-blocking system."}
