These types of events, which happen several times a semester, are part of the college's long-term goal to attract more women and minority students to engineering.\n\n\"In our college, we want to have gender parity, so 50 percent women, 50 percent men,\" said Amanda Parker, the college's director of access and recruiting. \"We also want a population that mimics the population of the state of Colorado for minority students, which is about 33 percent.\"\n\nThis year, women make up a record 28 percent of the engineering freshman class, up from 23 percent in 2012. Parker said the college as a whole is growing, too, so a 5 percent jump is significant.\n\nMore targeted recruiting efforts\n\nParker said the college is now specifically targeting female high school students in its recruiting efforts and has been using different words and contexts to explain engineering to them. In the spring, the college hosted a \"mocktail\" party for admitted students, which showed women there's more to being an engineer than the stereotypes they hear about, Parker said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Instead of talking just about cars and mechanics and things, we talk about how engineering is really a helping profession,\" Parker said. \"We also stress that just because you're interested in engineering, that's not all there is about you. We don't expect you to fit into this box. You can be feminine. You can be a dancer, a climber, a mountain biker. We don't like to generalize about the women that we have.\"\n\nThe goal of the levee-building project was to show the high school girls that engineers work in teams and help protect communities in times of disaster, like during the Colorado flooding in September.\n\nAttracting minority students has been more challenging for the college. This year, minority students make up 13.7 percent of the freshman engineering class, up from 13.2 percent in 2012.\n\nNot only do engineers often make double or triple the median salary of other workers, Parker said, but the world needs all types of people to solve big challenges ahead.\n\n\"These problems are not going to be solved by one group and one gender of people,\" Parker said. \"We need to have different life perspectives, different cultures all giving their input and working to solve these problems.\"\n\nSome parents at Friday's event were surprised to learn how few women study or work in engineering fields.\n\nYvonne Richards, whose daughter Megan also attended the event, said she hadn't thought much about how male-dominated engineering is until she saw the numbers in front of her.\n\n\"I would've brought any of my kids,\" Richards said. \"I have two boys, two girls. I didn't realize there was such a discrepancy between the sexes.\"\n\nLearning about engineering processes\n\nMeanwhile, teams of high school girls waited nervously to see how many cups of water their levees would hold.\n\nMegan Robinson, Natalia Beltran Del Rio and Shannon Hessler huddled around a lab table, their levee design up for analysis.\n\n\"Your first barrier is this plastic, then the sponge, and then you've got a back-up barrier built by clay?\" said Mindy Zarske, CU's director of K-12 engineering education.\n\nThe three girls all nodded in agreement.\n\n\"You didn't use all your materials, and I actually think that's great because sometimes if you can do something that's effective with less material then it's less costly, so let's try it out,\" Zarske said.\n\nRobinson, Beltran Del Rio and Hessler watched, at times holding their breath, as their levee held nine cups of water before finally leaking.\n\nZarske, using the leak to teach the three girls about a key part of the engineering design process, sent them back to the drawing board to figure out how to make their current design even stronger.\n\n\"How could you make it even better than nine?\" Zarske asked.\n\nContact Staff Writer Sarah Kuta at 303-473-1106, kutas@dailycamera.com or twitter.com/sarahkuta.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/cu-news/ci_24436773/cu-boulder-making-strides-toward-more-diverse-engineering", "sailthru.author": "By Sarah Kuta  Camera Staff Writer", "ag": {"canon": "BoulderDailyCamera:article:24436773:view"}, "startDate": "2013-11-03T15:00:00-0700", "twitter": {"domain": "dailycamera.com", "description": "A group of 30 high school girls, split into teams, poked and prodded clay, pebbles, a sponge, duct tape, two straws, two popsicle sticks and some plastic wrap inside a small, rectangular bucket to make the sturdiest levee possible.", "title": "CU-Boulder making strides toward a more diverse engineering department", "url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/cu-news/ci_24436773/cu-boulder-making-strides-toward-more-diverse-engineering", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site21/2013/1101/20131101__04dcagirw~2.jpg", "site": "@dailycamera", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "modificationDate": "2013-11-03T17:24:51-0700", "endDate": "2023-11-03T17:29:06-0600", "news_keywords": "CU News, CU News news, Boulder Colorado CU News news, Boulder Colorado news, CU News Boulder news, CU News Colorado news, US CU News news, world CU News news.", "byline": "By Sarah Kuta", "pubDate": "2013-11-01T17:27:30-0600", "sailthru.date": "2013-11-03T15:00:00-0700", "sailthru.title": "CU-Boulder making strides toward a more diverse engineering department", "verify-v1": "TakAiHiDAOiNOP+m0YTx4DQeyjor+bTdc8e+pw6bDoI=", "sailthru.section": "CU News", "description": "A group of 30 high school girls, split into teams, poked and prodded clay, pebbles, a sponge, duct tape, two straws, two popsicle sticks and some plastic wrap inside a small, rectangular bucket to make the sturdiest levee possible.", "sailthru.site": "dailycamera.com", "msvalidate.01": "9DAB14005AD5A9FFA4CA0EF58CC794BA", "og": {"url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/cu-news/ci_24436773/cu-boulder-making-strides-toward-more-diverse-engineering", "image": "http://extras.dailycamera.com/images/dailycamera3.png", "type": "article", "description": "A group of 30 high school girls, split into teams, poked and prodded clay, pebbles, a sponge, duct tape, two straws, two popsicle sticks and some plastic wrap inside a small, rectangular bucket to make the sturdiest levee possible.", "title": "CU-Boulder making strides toward a more diverse engineering department"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "867892b0357001538903740c75a206f0"}, "google-site-verification": "07CC1xPDVU0znu496XTAjLyC32Ylj8zwWHlmrzx3pgY", "y_key": "c9d9b53f7f5af674"}, "article_summary": "Learning about engineering processesMeanwhile, teams of high school girls waited nervously to see how many cups of water their levees would hold.\n\"We also want a population that mimics the population of the state of Colorado for minority students, which is about 33 percent.\"\n\"I can't imagine these being very helpful with stability,\" said Megan Richards, who attends Dakota Ridge High School, holding up two flimsy straws.\nThis year, minority students make up 13.7 percent of the freshman engineering class, up from 13.2 percent in 2012.\nThese types of events, which happen several times a semester, are part of the college's long-term goal to attract more women and minority students to engineering."}
