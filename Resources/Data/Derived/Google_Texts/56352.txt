The Jeep Wrangler Sport 4WD is the cheapest 2015 vehicle to insure, according to a new analysis from Insure.com, a consumer insurance website. The average annual cost of insurance for a new Wrangler is $1,134.

The Jeep Patriot Sport 2WD took the second cheapest spot on the list ($1,136 per year), followed by the Honda CR-V LX 4WD ($1,160 per year). The Dodge Grand Caravan SE Plus and the Honda Odyssey LX rounded out the top spot with annual rates of $1,162 and $1,163 respectively.

Cheaper insurance rates are generally associated with cars that are easier to repair than others or that have fewer claims, or both.

The analysis, however, also found that rates vary significantly by state. The same owner of that Jeep Wrangler would pay just $964 per year for insurance in Maine – but would have to shell out more than $2,000 in Michigan.

The most expensive 2015 car to insure is the Nissan GT-R Nismo, which costs an average of $3,574 per year.

No matter what car you drive, periodically shopping around for a new insurance policy is the best way to save money. Customers who shopped around when switching insurers in the past year saved an average of $300, according to a report issued last year by J.D. Power & Associates.

You may also be able to reduce your premiums by bundling your home and auto policy with the same insurer, increasing your deductible, or switching to a pay-as-you drive policy.

Smart consumers certainly know to look beyond price when selecting auto insurance. “We try to educate consumers to also look at claims ratings, customer service ratings, and how financially stable the companies are,” says Josh Drziabiak, cofounder of insurance comparison site TheZebra.com.
