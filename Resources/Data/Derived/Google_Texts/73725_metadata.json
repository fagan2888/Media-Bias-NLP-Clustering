Lives are literally at stake.\u201d\n\nUnder the national health program (NHP) outlined by the physicians patients could choose to go to any doctor and hospital. Most hospitals and clinics would remain privately owned and operated, receiving a budget from the NHP to cover all operating costs. Physicians could continue to practice on a fee-for-service basis, or receive salaries from group practices, hospitals or clinics.\n\nThe program would be paid for by combining current sources of government health spending into a single fund with modest new taxes that would be fully offset by reductions in premiums and out-of-pocket spending. Co-pays and deductibles would be eliminated.\n\nThe single-payer program would save about $500 billion annually by eliminating the high overhead and profits of insurance firms, and the massive paperwork they inflict on hospitals and doctors.\n\nThe administrative savings of the streamlined system would fully offset the costs of covering the uninsured and upgraded coverage for everyone else, e.g. full coverage of prescription drugs, dental care and long-term care. Savings would also be redirected to currently underfunded health priorities, particularly public health.\n\nThe \u201csingle payer\u201d would be in a strong position to negotiate lower prices for medications and other medical supplies, yielding additional savings and reining in costs.\n\nSurveys show strong, rising support for single-payer national health insurance among physicians. A 2008 survey of physicians found that 59 percent supported \u201clegislation to establish national health insurance,\u201d up from 49 percent five years earlier.\n\n\u201cWe can no longer afford to waste the vast resources we do on the administrative costs, executive salaries, and profiteering of the private insurance system,\u201d said Dr. Marcia Angell, a co-author of the editorial and proposal, co-chair of the working group, member of the faculty of global health and social medicine at Harvard Medical School and former editor-in-chief of the New England Journal of Medicine. \u201cWe get too little for our money. It\u2019s time to put those resources into real health care for everyone.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 3.8.14", "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf424\"", "article_summary": "Surveys show strong, rising support for single-payer national health insurance among physicians.\nIt\u2019s time to put those resources into real health care for everyone.\u201d\nA 2008 survey of physicians found that 59 percent supported \u201clegislation to establish national health insurance,\u201d up from 49 percent five years earlier.\nLives are literally at stake.\u201dUnder the national health program (NHP) outlined by the physicians patients could choose to go to any doctor and hospital.\nThe editorial links to the full proposal titled \u201cBeyond the Affordable Care Act: A Physicians\u2019 Proposal for Single-Payer Health Care Reform\u201d and the names of all the signers, and it appeals for additional physicians to add their names as endorsers."}
