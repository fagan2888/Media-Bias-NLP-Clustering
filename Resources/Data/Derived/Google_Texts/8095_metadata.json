Law enforcement seized computers, documents and bank records.\n\nAttempts to reach Sheriff Office employees was unsuccessful.\n\nThe facility had volunteers and employees who cared for patients around the clock, Hill said. All the patients have been relocated with family members, the news release said.\n\nHill said the ministry, New Walk Ministries, didn\u2019t have to be licensed by the county or state because it was a religious group where people could live if they were saved by Jesus Christ and attended church. Patients\u2019 families were charged $600 a month, Hill said. The New Walk\n\nMinistries moved to Jackson County less than seven days ago, he said.\n\nResidents of the home attended St. Paul United Methodist Church on Summit Street in Gainesville, where Hill said he was a pastor.\n\nA spokeswoman with the Department of Community Health confirmed the home wasn\u2019t licensed, but declined to comment on what she said was an open investigation.\n\nThe state defines a personal care home as a place where the owner or manager provides housing, food and a personal service, which is not defined. It can be for-profit or nonprofit.\n\n\u201c(The ministry) was never known as a personal care home,\u201d Hill said. \u201cWe never was a personal care home.\u201d\n\nOwners of personal care homes must undergo a criminal background check.\n\nHill is currently under house arrest after pleading guilty to forgery in the first degree last month. Court records said that he submitted false paperwork on a car he was financing. He was sentenced in August to six years in prison, required to serve 60 days in jail and stay on probation for about five years and 10 months.\n\nHe was also convicted in 2004 for impersonating a police officer.\n\nHill said theft or fraud never took place at the ministry.\n\n\u201cI want that on the record,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is all my opinion. If we were not an African-American ministry ran here in Jackson County, this would not be going on.\u201d\n\nHow the home came to the attention of law enforcement is unclear. The Sheriff\u2019s Office said it was called to investigate an assault and noticed \u201cnumerous\u201d state violations. Hill said he called the deputies because a mentally ill woman was having a breakdown and had to be restrained.\n\nHill, who said he was renting the house, said he was ticketed for a zoning violation and not having a business license, he said.\n\nHill is trying to find a lawyer and said he will provide a news release Monday.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.gainesvilletimes.com/archives/88760/", "image": "http://media.morristechnology.com/webmedia/facebook_share_images/gainesville/020216thetimesogimgoptimzed.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "The Jackson County Sheriff\u2019s Office on Thursday shut down what it said was an unlicensed local health care facility run by a Gainesville man who has a criminal background.", "title": "Disputed home for mentally ill shut down this week"}, "twitter": {"site": "@gtimes", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noarchive", "title": "Disputed home for mentally ill shut down this week"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8293\"", "article_summary": "\u201cWe never was a personal care home.\u201dOwners of personal care homes must undergo a criminal background check.\nThe Jackson County Sheriff\u2019s Office on Thursday shut down what it said was an unlicensed local health care facility run by a Gainesville man who has a criminal background.\nReveckeyo Anwaan Hill, 29, was operating what he says was a ministry for mentally ill patients in need.\nHill said he called the deputies because a mentally ill woman was having a breakdown and had to be restrained.\nThe sheriff\u2019s office, Adult Protection Services and other state agencies have ongoing investigations, Mangum\u2019s news release said."}
