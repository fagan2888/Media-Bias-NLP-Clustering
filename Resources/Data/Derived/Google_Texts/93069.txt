A Pekin woman who was seriously injured in a two-car collision Friday morning on Grant Line Road died Saturday, according to Floyd County police.

Havannah Balentine, 19, died of multiple-blunt force trauma at University of Louisville Hospital.

Police said Balentine was traveling south on Grant Line in a silver 2005 Pontiac Grand Prix when the vehicle crossed a set of railroad tracks near Chapel Lane and skidded into the northbound lane.

Reconstruction at the scene indicated Balentine overcorrected twice causing her vehicle to lose control on the curved roadway and slam into a silver 2005 Kia van.

The van's driver, John Wright, 35, of Borden, was unhurt, but three of his passengers suffered non-life-threatening injuries and were taken to area hospitals. Police said speed appeared to be a factor.

Records show that Balentine graduated from Eastern High School in Pekin last spring and had played infield on the girls' softball team.

New Albany Police, Indiana State Police, New Chapel Fire Department and Yellow Ambulance assisted at the scene.
