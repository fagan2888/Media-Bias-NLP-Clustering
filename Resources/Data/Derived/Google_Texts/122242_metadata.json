In a statement, released on Jan. 15, Newell explained SolarCity would allow customers to participate in debt investment, where investors would loan money that would be used for SolarCity\u2019s projects and receive interest payments.\n\nAccording to Steve Eglash, executive director of Stanford University\u2019s Energy and Environment Affiliates Program and former president and chief executive officer of Cyrium Technologies, Inc. \u2014 a solar energy start-up \u2014 the Common Assets acquisition highlights a common trend in the solar industry: alternative funding models.\n\nIn recent years, investment in clean tech has \u201cfallen out of favor,\u201d according to Eglash. He referred to a period around 2008, when venture capitalists invested in clean tech, simply because it was clean and not because of the company\u2019s business model.\n\nErrol Hunter, the former senior counsel for Solyndra, Inc. \u2014 a company that manufactured solar panels that used cylindrical modules and thin-film technology \u2014 said he thinks the failure of that particular company also contributed to the decline in clean-tech investment. Solyndra secured a $535 million loan from the U.S. Department of Energy, but subsequently went bankrupt. \u201cIt was very politically charged and it left a sour taste around the idea of clean tech,\u201d Hunter said in an interview.\n\nNewell compared using Common Assets to opening up an e-trade account. The Common Assets investment platform is designed to appeal to investors with both large and small amounts of capital who want to invest in the renewable energy industry.\n\nThe company said details about the size of minimum investments and who can qualify as an investor will be disclosed when the offering documents are released. Individual investors can begin using the platform in June of this year.\n\nReaching out to smaller investors is not new for the solar industry. Community solar, in which utility customers can own or lease solar panels, and receive credit on their electricity bills, is another form of funding smaller investors interested in solar can tap.\n\nNor is SolarCity the only company using the Internet to reach smaller investors in an effort to increase investment in solar.\n\nMosaic Inc., an Oakland-based company that connects investors to solar projects, also uses an online investment platform.\n\nWhile Newell acknowledged the similarities between SolarCity and Mosaic Inc., he noted a fundamental difference: Mosaic focuses on investment in a single solar project, while SolarCity\u2019s model allows for investment in many projects at once.\n\n\u201cInvestors will get from us investment in a pool of thousands of solar projects,\u201d he told the Peninsula Press. \u201cAnd that is a fundamentally different approach. Both have their place but ours is about large, scalable financial opportunities.\u201d\n\nExposure to multiple projects can reduce risk. According to Newell, the investments will be subject to oversight from regulatory organizations, including the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nCommon Assets is SolarCity\u2019s third acquisition in the last twelve months. In 2013, SolarCity acquired Paramount Solar, Inc., a solar sales and marketing firm; and Zep Solar, Inc., a solar-module mounting start-up. Common Assets is the first acquisition that addresses investment strategy. The purchase price was not disclosed.\n\nThe new investment platform could appeal to younger, socially conscious investors, according to Mike McGehee, an associate professor of Materials Science and Engineering at Stanford University and a senior fellow at the Precourt Institute for Energy.\n\n\u201cThere are 28-year-olds who don\u2019t own a home but who want to make an investment for the environment,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are a lot of people with thousands or tens of thousands that they would like to invest and they were looking for an opportunity. SolarCity recognized that.\u201d\n\nEglash shares that view. He cited two primary motivations for investors to participate: philanthropic interest in helping the environment and profit. He also indicated that crowdfunding could be appealing for \u201cego and entertainment reasons, similar to the reasons people crowdfund new technologies.\u201d\n\nBut for some industry specialists, the acquisition of Common Assets raises questions. Marie Watanabe is a solar analyst for CleanTech Group, a market intelligence organization focused on clean technology. She described Common Assets as a start-up that was \u201cvery under-the-radar,\u201d saying she was unable to even find the company\u2019s website.\n\nHunter believes the Common Assets acquisition could signal SolarCity is having trouble raising money for solar projects.\n\n\u201cRaising money from a large number of small individual investors is painful,\u201d he said. \u201cI think this strategy may be a reaction to lack of interest from the larger institutional investors.\u201d\n\nHunter indicated that solar investments can take a long time to see returns. As a result the individual investor model for the solar industry may not be effective. He also remains skeptical about Common Assets, in light of SolarCity\u2019s recent acquisitions. Hunter cited two common reasons for acquisitions: complementary business models and absence of organic growth potential.\n\nAlthough clean-tech investment has been on the decline in recent years, Eglash doubts the decline is affecting SolarCity.\n\n\u201cSolarCity\u2019s value in the eyes of investors continues to be very strong because they appear to have found a good, profitable business model,\u201d he said. \u201cMy impression is that they have plenty of support from investors who believe in them and they\u2019re doing fine.\u201d\n\nSolarCity went public in December 2012. The 52-week range for the stock was $15.88 per share to $88.35 per share.\n\nBoth Eglash and Watanabe view the acquisition of Common Assets as an attempt to vertically integrate, another trend in the solar industry. Vertical integration allows companies to increase efficiency and reduce costs by housing elements to production, as opposed to depending on outside companies for their services.\n\nEglash interprets the new platform as a way to expand SolarCity from a solar installation company to a \u201cone-stop shop\u201d for everything solar, aside from solar panel production.\n\nWatanabe thinks the acquisition was a response to competition from other solar companies like SunRun Inc., which is also trying to vertically integrate. She indicated there are few differences between SolarCity\u2019s services and its competitors\u2019 services. Watanabe said she understands the acquisition as a strategy to maintain the company\u2019s dominance in the solar industry.\n\n\u201cThat was pretty big news to add that new service,\u201d she said. \u201cThey had a head start in the market \u2014 they secured a huge market share [but] I think they still have to keep finding innovative ways to offer more services to clients because other players are catching up.\u201d\n\nSolarCity does not only face competition from other solar companies. Hunter indicated that natural gas, which dominates California electricity, and the increasing production of shale gas will continue to put downward pressure on energy prices, as well as the economics of solar.\n\nWhether or not retail investment offers a long-term funding strategy for solar remains to be seen.\n\n\u201cFor about five years or so, lots and lots of people have been talking about innovative finance schemes around renewable energy,\u201d Eglash said. \u201cWhat SolarCity wants to do is explore lots of options so they can continue to win in this market. It\u2019s not clear to anyone how this will all shake out.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Common Assets,crowdfunding,Environment,finance,financing,Marianne Levine,San Mateo,solar,SolarCity,Business & Money,Science & Tech,Frontpage Featured", "description": "When SolarCity bought investment platform Common Assets, some analysts began to wonder: why would a solar installation company with investors like Draper Fisher\u2026", "generator": "WordPress 3.5", "robots": "noodp,noydir"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2723\"", "article_summary": "Hunter believes the Common Assets acquisition could signal SolarCity is having trouble raising money for solar projects.\nShe described Common Assets as a start-up that was \u201cvery under-the-radar,\u201d saying she was unable to even find the company\u2019s website.\nNewell compared using Common Assets to opening up an e-trade account.\n\u201cInvestors will get from us investment in a pool of thousands of solar projects,\u201d he told the Peninsula Press.\nCommon Assets is SolarCity\u2019s third acquisition in the last twelve months."}
