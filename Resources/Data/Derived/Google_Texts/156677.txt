Some nearby residents have expressed opposition. Plans call for a three-story, 101-unit apartment complex and a two-story, 70-unit senior living and memory care facility. The projects would be sandwiched between the existing Masonic and Japanese cemeteries. The new facilities are proposed for 2250 and 2300 E. Pleasant Valley Road, at the intersection with Etting Road.

The final decision on the projects, both from developer Vince Daly, will be made later by the City Council.

The Planning Commission meets at 7 p.m. Thursday in council chambers at 300 W. Third St.
