Perhaps we\u2019d be better off if they just switched places.\n\nSixty-four \u201cfreshman\u201d U.S. senators and representative were sworn in this week. And \u201cSpring Rush\u201d is beginning at many universities.\n\nCollege fraternity houses have come under a lot of criticism lately. So have the houses of congress. Perhaps the two sets of institutions should switch places. Road trip!\n\n(And who wouldn\u2019t like to see 64 congressmen paddled during Hell Week?)\n\nCertainly legislation in Washington would be more interesting with fraternities in charge\u2014\u201cH.R. 4932 Keg Stand on the Supreme Court Act of 2015.\u201d Everybody running around Capital Hill, drunk as all hell, and keeping lookout as Antonin Scalia vomits behind a dumpster.\n\nPlus campus behavior would be more decorous\u2014\u201cNancy Pelosi Gone Wild\u201d won\u2019t be the kind of thing people order on Pay Per View.\n\nMedia distaste for fraternities (most reporters were blackballed) could take the heat off congress. And media dislike for congress (we weren\u2019t hired as anybody\u2019s Communications Director, either) could relieve the pressures on fraternities.\n\nFraternities have been accused of hazing fatalities, gender and sexual orientation prejudice, and\u2014even in such venues as Rolling Stone, which has been championing excessive ingestion of mind-altering substances and untoward sexual behavior for nearly five decades \u2014- excessive ingestion of mind-altering substances and untoward sexual behavior.\n\nAnd fraternity members have been accused of falling off roofs. In a blistering Atlantic article, \u201cThe Dark Power of Fraternities,\u201d writer Caitlin Flanagan said, \u201cFar from being freakish and unpredictable events, fatal and near-fatal falls from fraternity-house roofs, balconies, windows, and sleeping porches are fairly regular occurrences across the country.\u201d\n\nGiven that, even the most Tea Party-leaning congressional freshman should be willing to work with the president to reform rather than revoke the Affordable Care Act. At least if the congressional freshman is living in a frat house. Otherwise, that broken leg\u2019s really going to cut into the beer budget.\n\nCongress has been blamed for\u2026 There\u2019s no space here to give a detailed list. But pointless partisan quarrels, legislative deadlock and dangerous politicization of foreign and domestic policies are a start.\n\nWill Gamma Omega Pi and Delta Epsilon Mu get along better than the GOP and the Dems? They have no choice. The North American Interfraternity Conference requires each chapter of its 74 member fraternities to maintain a 2.7, or C+, cumulative grade-point average. In the latest Gallup poll Congress got a 16 percent job approval rating, which is an F where I went to school.\n\nAnd the keg parties might be salubrious for our political elite.\n\nSenator Bernie Sanders: \u201cCruiser-man! Yo, dawg!\u201d\n\nSenator Ted Cruz: \u201cBurn-Up! I love you, bro!\u201d\n\nGiven that the American electorate is 53 percent women, fraternities will need to become co-ed. This should improve frat boy behavior. When Sen. Barbara Mikulski (D, M.D.) yells, \u201cYou get down off that roof!\u201d\u2014you get down off that roof. Mikulski grew up in east Baltimore and was a Catholic Charities social worker. Congressmen don\u2019t want her coming after them with a ruler she got from a nun.\n\nGet The Beast In Your Inbox!

Kirsten Gillibrand (D, N.Y.) asked them to. Who could say no to Sen. Gillibrand? She\u2019s so cute.\n\nMeanwhile in D.C. the Capital building is being filled with tiki heads, bamboo torches, ukuleles, flaming pupu platters, rum drinks in coconut shells, 535 leis and Hawaiian shirts and 15 tons of beach sand for \u201cAloha Friday.\u201d At last President Obama is pressed into having a personal, social relationship with legislators (and into doing a hula dance).\n\nSpring Break is made a national holiday. Admiral Michael S. Rogers, Director of the NSA, attempts to jump into the swimming pool from the balcony of his 4th floor hotel room in Panama City, Florida, and there is an end to the NSA snooping debate.\n\nThere\u2019s also an end to jihad and fighting in the Middle East as America\u2019s first pan-Hellenic House and Senate consult the beer bong and decide to make Spring Break hotel reservations on the beaches of Syria, Gaza, Iran\u2019s Persian Gulf resort island of Kish, and Lake Zorkul in Afghanistan. Jihadists, militias, and military hurry to get away from the danger, the chaos and the plummeting admirals in Speedos.\n\nThe Washington Redskins finally have a VIP fan base that demands an NFL team at least up to the standards of Northern Illinois University. And the corruption-plagued and scandal-ridden spectacle of college football is mitigated by a new kind of student-athlete.\n\n\u201cSpeaker of the House John Boehner takes the hike\u2026 He falls back\u2026 He pauses to light a Marlboro\u2026\u201d\n\nLiberal congressmen with their squishy, pseudo-socialist progressive views will get what they deserve\u2014professors who give \u201cgood marks for good Marx,\u201d read in the original German.\n\nTroglodyte conservative congressman will find out just how hard it is to get a date when you\u2019re a member of the College Republicans. Sen. Gillibrand said she had to wash her hair tonight.\n\nAs congressmen and senators face these sobering experiences, Federal Regulatory Agencies are ordered to make their decisions according to who wins at Beer Pong.\n\nWashington Post headlines:\n\n\u201cFed to Print More Money as Janet Yellen Out-Chug-a-Lugs Ron Paul\u201d\n\n\u201cFood and Drug Administration Orders Pizza\u201d", "article_metadata": {"twitter": {"site": "@thedailybeast", "card": "summary", "creator": "PJORourke"}, "keywords": "u.s. poli, Kirsten Gillibrand, Rolling Stone, John Boehner", "publicationDate": 201501101145, "wrap": "/content/dailybeast/politics", "news_keywords": "US Politics, Kirsten Gillibrand, Rolling Stone, John Boehner", "pageNum": 1, "title": "Lets Just Let Frats Run America", "tags": "topic:politics,entity:person/kirsten_gillibrand,entity:publishedmedium/rolling_stone,entity:person/john_boehner", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Beast", "description": "Everyone hates fraternities, and everyone hates Congress.
