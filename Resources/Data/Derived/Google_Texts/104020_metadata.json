Supporters of the law say the counseling amounts to little more than parents taking steps to stop their kids from being homosexual.\n\nStaver, who is arguing this case in California and represents two families involved in such counseling, told WND that\u2019s total fiction.\n\n\u201cThis is about minors who want this kind of counseling and parents who want to support their sons or daughters to get this kind of counseling,\u201d Staver said. \u201cThese minors have gone to their parents and said, \u2018I am having these issues, and I am beginning to have these same-sex sexual attractions. I don\u2019t want to have these attractions. I don\u2019t want to engage in same-sex behavior. I don\u2019t want to identify myself as homosexual. Can you help me?\u2019 And so the parents have sought out counselors who can.\n\n\u201cThe counseling has actually helped these children. Their self-anger and self-hatred has gone down. Their self-esteem has gone up. Their relationships with their friends have improved. The relationships with their families have greatly improved,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cNow under this particular law and this ruling, that counsel will have to come to an end. This is devastating to them. This is a very dangerous decision because for the first time we have the government telling a counselor what kind of counsel he or she may give to a client who needs it, instead of leaving it up to the counselor\u2019s professional judgment and to the clients who have a right of self-determination to set their own counseling objectives.\u201d\n\nStaver said his clients will likely appeal the decision to the full 9th Circuit rather than go straight to the Supreme Court. That decision is partly due to Staver successfully arguing for an injunction to the law before to a separate three-judge panel of the court last year. He said that hearing proved the state has no basis for arguing that this sort of therapy is harmful, with one of the judges strongly rejecting the argument provided by the government.\n\n\u201cThey tried to point to the (American Psychological Association) Task Force of 2009, and the judge said, \u2018That doesn\u2019t support it.\u2019 In fact, the same task force says there\u2019s evidence of benefit of this kind of counseling. There\u2019s no research whatsoever, zero, regarding minors,\u201d Staver said. \u201cSo the state doesn\u2019t have any background or foundation to ban this kind of viewpoint. This is completely and only politically motivated.\u201d\n\nStaver believes public officials who should be affirming traditional marriage and other constitutional freedoms but aren\u2019t fall into two categories: 1) those who share the liberal ideology on homosexuality and 2) those who fear the fierce backlash of the homosexual movement. He said it\u2019s a relentless movement that is not just content to demonize contrary beliefs but to force acceptance of its agenda.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing is the zero-sum game that I talked about a long time ago that\u2019s coming and now is here,\u201d he said. \u201cThe homosexual agenda is a zero-sum. There\u2019s a winner and a loser. There\u2019s no compromise. There is no tolerance. It is a dominating agenda that no only wants to crush every other worldview or every other contrary opinion, but force every other contrary opinion to fall in line and affirm homosexuality as normative. That\u2019s the clash that\u2019s here.\u201d\n\nAccording to Staver, the demand for total acceptance and even celebration of homosexuality is intensifying by the day. He said it won\u2019t be long at all before churches are targeted legally for accurately preaching scripture on the issue or for refusing to perform same-sex ceremonies.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s right around the corner. I think we saw the decision last week of the Supreme Court of New Mexico saying to a wedding photographer, \u2018You\u2019ve got to give up your religious freedom if you want to be a wedding photographer. You\u2019ve got to be forced to photograph same-sex ceremonies.\u2019 I mean, that\u2019s just as absurd as saying you\u2019ve got to be forced to photograph KKK rallies,\u201d Staver said.\n\n\u201cHere you\u2019ve got a lady who says, \u2018I\u2019ll photograph anybody, but I\u2019m not going to photograph a same-sex commitment ceremony.\u2019 This court said, \u2018You have to. You must, not withstanding your religious convictions. Either give up your religious convictions or change them or get out of that profession.\u2019 That\u2019s the zero-sum game. That\u2019s the zero-sum collision that we\u2019re facing.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Free Press For A Free People Since 1997", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.1", "og": {"site_name": "WND", "description": "The federal court ruling this week affirming a ban on counseling that discourages acting on homosexual attraction is blatantly unconstitutional, and part of the \u201cgay\u201d lobby\u2019s effort to force approval of their behavior in every corner of the nation, warns Liberty Counsel President and Chairman Mathew Staver.
