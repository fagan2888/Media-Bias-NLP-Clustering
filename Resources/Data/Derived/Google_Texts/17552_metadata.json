However, for those that know the retired good doctor \u2014 and rumored presidential hopeful \u2014 it\u2019s another example of his anti-Obama name-calling that some say signals his eventual entry into the fray of candidates vying for the White House in the 2016 elections. And as of this writing, Carson has not walked back his charge that the POTUS is a psychopathic liar, this according to a CNN report.\n\nA GQ writer caught up with the renowned neurosurgeon, the first ever to separate conjoined twins (at the head) in the United States, on the night President Obama gave his sixth State of the Union Address. Carson was only a short distance away from Capitol Hill at the home of Armstrong Williams, his so-called image-maker and likely campaign manager \u2014 should he announce his run for the presidency.\n\nShortly into the speech, Carson studied Obama like he was sizing up his quarry on a hunt, and called him a psychopath. He elaborated on Williams\u2019 comment moments earlier that the Democratic leader of the free world looked \u201celegant\u201d on camera. Ben Carson continued his diatribe in a surgical-like manner, not mincing his words along the way. In his opinion, what Obama is \u201cselling\u201d America is simply a \u201clie.\u201d\n\n\u201cLike most psychopaths. That\u2019s why they\u2019re successful. That\u2019s the way they look. They all look great. He\u2019s trying to sell what he thinks is not true! He\u2019s sitting there saying, \u2018These Americans are so stupid I can tell them anything.\u2019 \u201c\n\nCarson is also known for calling \u201cObamacare the worst thing since slavery.\u201d Moreover, his assertion that \u201cprison proves being gay is a choice\u201d inflamed the LGBT community, liberals, and even members of the Tea Party. He\u2019s even lobbed incendiary comments about bestiality and pedophilia when talking about American politics under Democrats and the Obama Administration. And who can forget the rhetoric from Ben Carson when he said America today is \u201cvery much like Nazi Germany.\u201d So, the fact the retired brain surgeon likened the POTUS to a psychopath is not that unusual, considering his history.\n\nMany pundits call Carson\u2019s barrage of attacks against the president smear campaign tactics. As a probable candidate for the Republican nomination, the theatrics from the esteemed surgeon and other anti-Obama emissaries \u2014 Rand Paul, Ted Cruz, and others \u2014 are expected and well tolerated at this stage of the game. However, when political window-dressers descend on the race tarmac, Ben Carson may be need to tone down his fiery characterization of Obama, and referring to him as a psychopath may be a dangerous gamble.\n\nPsychologist Deborah Stokes, PhD, countered and said in her professional opinion, Ben Carson \u201cmisdiagnosed Obama\u201d by calling him a psychopath. Instead, she thinks a more appropriate assessment is \u201ccharming sociopath.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey lure people in with their charisma. We see that with politicians, with cult figures and so forth.\u201d\n\n[Photo by: Scott Olson/Getty Images]", "article_metadata": {"description": "If one didn't know Dr. Ben Carson, they'd think he diagnosed Barack Obama as a psychopath, based on his recent statements.
