Even Bernie Sanders, who seems as if he\u2019d be as comfortable passing a joint in a lava-lamp lit room as he is in front of a crowd of 30,000, only reluctantly went as far to say he\u2019d vote for legalization in Nevada, one of five states that will decide in 2016 whether or not to make pot legal.\n\nClinton\u2019s stand is essentially a \u201cstates\u2019 rights\u201d case for letting legalization creep along.\n\nThis iffy doctrine has been used for progressive causes in the past. But it\u2019s especially unfortunate to hear the right\u2019s favorite excuse for racial inequality invoked by the left when it comes to The New Jim Crow, one of the most vexing civil rights issues of our times.\n\nPOT ISN'T ALL THAT BAD: STUDY\n\nUnequal enforcement of drug laws has help ensnare African-American men in our criminal justice system in far greater numbers than whites. Even though blacks use marijuana at about the same rate as white people, they\u2019re arrested for the offense four or more times more frequently.\n\nI\u2019m not suggesting that Clinton or Sanders should come out for national legalization now. There is a place for states to make their own decisions on this. But leading Democrats should definitively call on Congress to decriminalize the drug \u2014 to remove it from Schedule 1 of the U.S. Controlled Substances Act, where dangerous narcotics are regulated.\n\nThat is how we will ensure the next President doesn\u2019t casually decide to reverse all the progress that\u2019s been made on this issue.\n\nOddly and luckily for Democrats, no major Republican candidate (sorry, Rand Paul doesn\u2019t count) has been savvy enough to get ahead of them on decriminalization yet \u2014 despite it being a classic \u201cget big government out of my glass pipe\u201d issue.\n\nChris Christie has vowed to single-handedly go Kool-Aid on Colorado\u2019s burgeoning pot industry, though he has less of a chance of becoming President than a giant sack of weed.\n\nCarly Fiorina used a question about pot legalization to conflate the drug\u2019s use with her step-daughter\u2019s battles with prescription medication, alcohol and bulimia.\n\n\u201cWe are misleading young people when we tell them that marijuana is just like having beer,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s not.\u201d\n\nShe\u2019s right. It\u2019s less dangerous than alcohol. That isn\u2019t to say pot use is entirely consequence free. For decades, I smoked almost daily and found it to be a crutch that left me emotionally stunted. I\u2019m glad I\u2019m done with it and wouldn\u2019t recommend it to anyone who loved it as much as I did.\n\nBut it did not lead to harder drugs. And the only crime it led to was me stealing horrible live Phish tracks I\u2019d never listen to sober via Napster.\n\nCHECK OUT OUR NEW APP: GET THE DAILY NEWS ON ANDROID OR IOS\n\nThe only convincing arguments against pot legalization are made by those arguing for full decriminalization of all narcotics. These proponents of full withdrawal from the drug war, including \u201cThe Wire\u201d creator David Simon, fear that once middle-class white bros like me get legal pot, we\u2019ll forget about the millions of minority families being destroyed by the full scope of our unequally enforced drug laws.\n\nThe point is that we\u2019re past the point where the status quo is acceptable. The public wants action. And we should not miss this opportunity while national crime rates remain at generational lows.\n\nTo ensure that we\u2019re taking on the larger drug war, national pot decriminalization that allows for state legalization could be tied to a small sin tax that could fund drug treatment.\n\nThis is the kind of drug experimentation that Democrats should be encouraging. And they should do it quickly, before an unconventional politician on the right with nothing to lose \u2014 say, Donald Trump \u2014 decides to drag this issue to their side.\n\nSattler, a writer, tweets @lolgop.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Jason Sattler", "twitter": {"description": "At the first Democratic debate last week, the presidential contenders spoke to the party\u2019s growing liberal base", "title": "Jason Sattler: On fixing pot laws, Dems blow smoke", "url": "http://www.nydailynews.com/opinion/jason-sattler-fixing-pot-laws-dems-blow-smoke-article-1.2400789", "image": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.2400788.1445029419!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/high-holiday-colorado.jpg", "site": "@nydailynews", "card": "summary"}, "sailthru.tags": "remove marijuana as a narcotic, schedule 1 narcotics, marijuana legalization, hillary clinton, bernie sanders, dem debate, marijuana democratic debate,", "parsely-author": "Jason Sattler", "parsely-type": "article", "keywords": "remove marijuana as a narcotic, schedule 1 narcotics, marijuana legalization, hillary clinton, bernie sanders, dem debate, marijuana democratic debate,", "nydn_tags": "marijuana legalization, bernie sanders, hillary clinton, chris christie, carly fiorina, 2016 election", "news_keywords": "remove marijuana as a narcotic, schedule 1 narcotics, marijuana legalization, hillary clinton, bernie sanders, dem debate, marijuana democratic debate,", "parsely-link": "http://www.nydailynews.com/opinion/jason-sattler-fixing-pot-laws-dems-blow-smoke-article-1.2400789", "parsely-title": "Jason Sattler: On fixing pot laws, Dems blow smoke", "sailthru.date": "2015-10-19T05:00:00-0400", "sailthru.title": "Jason Sattler: On fixing pot laws, Dems blow smoke", "nydn_section": "Opinion", "parsely-pub-date": "2015-10-19T09:00:00", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.2400788.1445029419!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/high-holiday-colorado.jpg", "description": "At the first Democratic debate last week, the presidential contenders spoke to the party\u2019s growing liberal base", "robots": "NOARCHIVE", "fb": {"admins": 1594068001, "app_id": 107464888913, "pages": 268914272540}, "msvalidate.01": "02916AAC0DA8B068EFE01D721E03ED7E", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/NYDailyNews/"}, "sailthru.description": "At the first Democratic debate last week, the presidential contenders spoke to the party\u2019s growing liberal base", "viewport": "width=device-width, height=device-height, initial-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no", "parsely-section": "Opinion", "og": {"site_name": "NY Daily News", "description": "At the first Democratic debate last week, the presidential contenders spoke to the party\u2019s growing liberal base", "title": "Jason Sattler: On fixing pot laws, Dems blow smoke", "url": "http://www.nydailynews.com/opinion/jason-sattler-fixing-pot-laws-dems-blow-smoke-article-1.2400789", "image": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.2400788.1445029419!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/high-holiday-colorado.jpg", "type": "article"}, "parsely-tags": "marijuana legalization, bernie sanders, hillary clinton, chris christie, carly fiorina, 2016 election", "parsely-image-url": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.2400788.1445029419!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/high-holiday-colorado.jpg", "p": {"domain_verify": "78efe4f5c9935744af497772f68a0ee7"}, "nydn_byline": "Jason Sattler", "sailthru.credits": "NEW YORK DAILY NEWS"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda883\"", "article_summary": "Carly Fiorina used a question about pot legalization to conflate the drug\u2019s use with her step-daughter\u2019s battles with prescription medication, alcohol and bulimia.\nDEMOCRATICS KICKED OFF THEIR FIRST 2016 DEBATEHillary Clinton refused to go beyond allowing Colorado, Oregon and Washington to play out their experimental phase of pot legalization.\nI\u2019m not suggesting that Clinton or Sanders should come out for national legalization now.\nThat isn\u2019t to say pot use is entirely consequence free.\nClinton\u2019s stand is essentially a \u201cstates\u2019 rights\u201d case for letting legalization creep along."}
