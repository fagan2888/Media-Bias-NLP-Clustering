In reality, Kelly asked a splashy, challenging question in the beginning about Cheney\u2019s discredited record on Iraq but for most of the rest of the interview, Kelly handed the Cheneys their talking points on a silver platter.\n\nDon\u2019t tell me she wasn\u2019t expecting everyone to pay attention to her challenge and overlook how she subtly advanced Fox's propaganda elsewhere.\n\nIt certainly worked for Meyers. \u201cWas that terrifying? Is it terrifying to call out Dick Cheney?\u201d he asked last night. But the question he should have asked is whether she pre-cleared the challenge with Fox higher ups and, if not, how they reacted.\n\nInstead, Meyers question allowed Kelly to pose as a brave truth-teller as she said it was \"not at all\" terrifying to confront the former vice president. \u201cIt got a lot of attention,\" she said. \"And it was interesting because he, Liz Cheney and Lynne Cheney went on a political roundtable afterward and Mike Allen said, \u2018Oh, you know, Megyn Kelly at Fox News \u2013 no enemy to you \u2013 called you out in this fashion.\u2019 And Mrs. Cheney said, \u2018Of course she did.\u2019 She said, \u2018That is what journalists are expected to do.\u2019\n\nKelly said she \"really appreciated\" Lynne Cheney's comment \"because I said on my own show he was right. I\u2019m not an enemy to Dick Cheney and I\u2019m not a friend of Dick Cheney. I\u2019m a journalist who has to ask tough questions and he came in and answered them.\u201d\n\nKelly got a round of Late Night applause for that.\n\nBut the truth is, Kelly only asks tough questions to certain people some of the time. Check out her fawning interview with discredited ACORN \"ho\u201d - and right-wing darling - Hannah Giles and compare that to her antagonism toward ObamaCare architect Ezekiel Emanuel, e.g.\n\nMeyers seemed to duck the issue of Kelly\u2019s actual behavior \u2013 while promoting her self-serving version: \u201cYou describe yourself as a fair, down-the-middle journalist. Your show is on between two, I would describe as very conservative journalists. You\u2019re on after Bill O\u2019Reilly, you\u2019re on before Sean Hannity,\u201d he said slyly.\n\nAfter joking that O\u2019Reilly might one day write a book called, \u201cKilling Megyn\u201d if she beats him in the ratings, she said, \u201cHe does opinion and Sean does opinion.\u201d\n\nMeyers used the same tactic again. \u201cIs it hard on Fox News to convince people or make people believe this idea that you are sort of a down-the-middle journalist?\u201d Again, he didn\u2019t say Kelly is an objective journalist but he handed her an opening to present herself as such.\n\n\u201cNo, I mean I think they know,\u201d Kelly said. \u201cI think they watch the show. You know, I do sort of a news analysis show in the evening but I\u2019m not out there, like O\u2019Reilly, you know calling for the troops to X, Y or Z, advising President Obama on how he needs to behave. It\u2019s not my thing. But we\u2019ll put pundits on who will offer their opinions and for me, you know, they still use me in a straight news capacity and I enjoy that. I like doing the presidential debates. I like going out there on election night. That\u2019s the big thrill.\u201d\n\nThat may be true in the most literal sense. Kelly does not directly advocate. But she very competently telegraphs Fox\u2019s message every night.\n\nIt\u2019s a shame Meyers helped enable this play acting.\n\nWatch how he did it, below.", "article_metadata": {"csrf-param": "authenticity_token", "google-site-verification": "google51c0b549f514d464.html", "csrf-token": "ZgqaPYWTsg+fIAwltSrtMo1qXhyq2RuA23cdobeJNhM=", "og": {"url": "http://www.newshounds.us/seth_meyers_helps_megyn_kelly_perpetuate_her_i_m_down_the_middle_myth08012014", "type": "article", "image": "http://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/newshounds/sites/1/meta_images/original/Newshound3_blue.png?1327001871", "site_name": "NewsHounds", "title": "Seth Meyers Helps Megyn Kelly Perpetuate Her \u2018I\u2019m Down-The-Middle\u2019 Myth"}, "Title": "Seth Meyers Helps Megyn Kelly Perpetuate Her \u2018I\u2019m Down-The-Middle\u2019 Myth"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe10f9\"", "article_summary": "I\u2019m not an enemy to Dick Cheney and I\u2019m not a friend of Dick Cheney.\nIn her Late Night with Seth Meyers interview last night, Meyers held up Kelly\u2019s interview with Dick Cheney, his wife and daughter as an example of some kind of tough, unbiased journalism.\n\u201cNo, I mean I think they know,\u201d Kelly said.\nIn reality, Kelly asked a splashy, challenging question in the beginning about Cheney\u2019s discredited record on Iraq but for most of the rest of the interview, Kelly handed the Cheneys their talking points on a silver platter.\nIs it terrifying to call out Dick Cheney?\u201d he asked last night."}
