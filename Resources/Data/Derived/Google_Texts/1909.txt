Sioux Falls, SD

Curling, which became an official Olympic sport in 1998, is very similar to shuffleboard. Teams take turns sliding stones across a sheet of ice towards a four-tier target, with points rewarded on how close you get to the center. This weekend, the Sioux Falls curling club allowed outdoor enthusiasts the chance to learn about the sport and try it out. Club members say it's fun for the whole family, and can truly be played by anyone.

"Anyone can do it. Elderly people in wheelchairs can have special handles to put on the stones to push off. It's one of the only sports where can have 3 to 4 generations. You can have Grandparents, parents and kids all playing on the same team," said Mike Ford.

The club said a number of newcomers came out to participate, and they were impressed by the turnout. A sport that has been described as "chess on ice", curling has grown rapidly in popularity since the last Winter Games in Vancouver. The clubs feels with the next Olympics right around the corner, the timing could not be better. "I think now is a great time to try to build steam for the curling club to try and move indoors with the Olympics coming around, and get everyone excited about it. I certainly enjoy watching it on TV," said Dustin Hansen.

The Sioux Falls curing club is continuing to gain traction in the community, and has big goals for the future. They say their goal is continue to expand the sport locally, attract a larger audience, and make it a common event from Friends and Family to participate in. "Future goal is to get inside, and we would love to have curling leagues going - just open curling. Kind of like open how people can go out to the bowling ally and grab a lane, it would be fun to go out and get a curling lane and just go curling with your friends," Ford said.
