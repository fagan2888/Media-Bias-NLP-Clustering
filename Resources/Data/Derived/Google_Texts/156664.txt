Arson investigators say Brian Soles burned himself and a midtown Tulsa house in April while manufacturing meth.

A man burned earlier this year while reportedly making methamphetamine has been arrested for indecent exposure. Brian Edward Soles is in Tulsa County Jail on a $100,600 bond.

Police say they were called to the QuikTrip at Yale and Admiral at 4 p.m Saturday after a girl complained of a man exposing himself to her. The victim said she was in the parking lot with her 7-year-old and 9-year-old sisters in the car when Soles stepped out of his vehicle, exposed himself and began masturbating, according to an arrest report.

Police say the girl went inside and told the clerk who saw the same thing.

When officers arrested Soles, they learned he had several outstanding warrants for his arrest. He was wanted for first degree arson in a meth lab explosion on April 25, 2013. Soles was reportedly making meth at a home in the 4100 block of South Zunis Avenue when his "one pot" lab exploded.

That day, Soles set fire to himself and the home while using ingredients like acid, Drano and Coleman lantern fuel to make meth, according to an arson investigator's report.

Soles, 44, has previous convictions in Tulsa and Osage counties including burglary, possession of a stolen vehicle and bail jumping.

He was booked Saturday on two counts of indecent exposure after former conviction of a felony and on outstanding warrants for arson, manufacturing a controlled substance and traffic violations.
