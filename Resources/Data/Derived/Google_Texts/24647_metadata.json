(Not Justin Timberlake; the other one, the burly, hirsute fella who looks like an extra in that new movie where Leonardo DiCaprio sleeps in bear carcasses.) Chris Stapleton is his name, and many a die-hard modern country fan had no idea who he was until last night, and that is very much the point, because the country music establishment is sick to death of die-hard modern country fans. Stapleton\u2019s shocking sweep last night was a coronation, an intervention, and an assassination attempt.\n\nThe coronation part is obvious: Stapleton is a big-shot songwriter and former bluegrass-band stalwart whose solo debut, Traveller, is classic-sounding and big-hearted and regally forlorn, as though sung by a dude curled in the fetal position and suspended in a keg of beer. Craft beer, though! A good IPA. It\u2019s not quite great, but it sounds Authentic and Human, and at this point, that\u2019ll do. Critics loved it, but it didn\u2019t sell much, and you sure as hell never hear it on country radio. That\u2019s the intervention part.\n\nIf you hate modern country music\u2014if you dismiss it as the province of tight pants and backwards ballcaps and ill-advised forays into rapping and \u201clet\u2019s drive out to the middle of nowhere in my truck so I can fuck you in a cornfield\u201d love songs that sound suspiciously like abduction scenarios, well, this IPA\u2019s for you. The biggest CMA Award last night, Entertainer of the Year, went to Luke Bryan, who\u2019s fine in small doses but is perhaps best known as the guy who once fell offstage while covering Macklemore, which is a better argument for the existence of God than any country song I\u2019ve ever heard. Almost every major star these days is trying to rip him off. (Sam Hunt is best at it; Chase Rice is the worst.) The bros are running the asylum; as for their better halves, practically the only way for a newer female artist to have a big hit nowadays is to write a song explicitly complaining about this situation. It was all amusing for awhile, but it has since grown intolerable. Bros got plenty of airtime last night, but few actual awards and no respect. That\u2019s the assassination part.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWeighing down a relative unknown like Stapleton with Album of the Year, Best New Artist, and Male Vocalist of the Year trophies is the CMAs\u2019 not terribly subtle way of hanging a PLEASE GOD LISTEN TO THIS GUY INSTEAD banner across the stage, and across the television screens of fans industry stalwarts wish had way better taste. \u201cCountry Music For People Who Don\u2019t Like Country Music\u201d has long since hardened into a clich\u00e9; from Kacey Musgraves to Jamey Johnston to Sturgill Simpson, it\u2019s a genre unto itself. Stapleton\u2019s just the latest champion, but what\u2019s new is that last night the industry handed him the biggest, shiniest, loudest megaphone possible. SAVE US FROM OURSELVES, was the subtext. We\u2019ll see. Let\u2019s all dial up a country station a month from now and hope for the best.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "COUNTRY MUSIC, THE CMAS, BRO COUNTRY, CHRIS STAPLETON, LUKE BRYAN, The Concourse", "author": "Rob Harvilla", "og": {"site_name": "The Concourse", "description": "So the 49th-annual Country Music Association Awards\u2014the Grammys for people who hate ObamaCare, basically\u2014went down last night, and the guy in this video won all the important ones.
