The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services issued a proposed rule Monday that would update Medicare payment policies and rates under the Inpatient Prospective Payment System and the Long-Term Care Hospital Prospective Payment System.

The proposed rule would increase operating payment rates for eligible general acute care hospitals paid under the IPPS by 0.9 percent, CMS says.

The payment policy changes would affect hospital discharges occurring after Oct. 1, 2016.

“By law, CMS is required to update payment rates for IPPS hospitals annually, and to account for changes in the costs of goods and services used by these hospitals in treating Medicare patients, as well as for other factors,” CMS said in a release.
