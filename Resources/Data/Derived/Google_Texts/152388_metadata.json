Terms like \u201cCalifornia liberal\u201d or \u201cMassachusetts liberal\u201d are well known (and, depending on whom you ask, pejorative) terms in the American political lexicon. But \u201cMaryland liberal\u201d? Not so much. It sounds clunky and sort of hilarious. This could all change if Maryland decides to veer left and elect Heather Mizeur, a wonky, pro-pot married lesbian, as governor.\n\nHeather Mizeur has just finished explaining everything, seemingly every public policy issue, in exacting detail to a group of surprisingly still-awake seniors and stray nearby supporters at the Springwell Senior Living Community in Baltimore City. We\u2019re talking: criminal justice reform, drug policy reform, tax cuts, tax hikes, school construction policy, wages, fracking, campaign finance, health care, more health care, family planning, corporate tax loopholes, universal pre-kindergarten, and marriage equality, to name a few. Mizeur, a two-term member of the Maryland House of Delegates, brings to bear her encyclopedic memory of acronyms and best practices research from across the country (\u201cFive states across the country have tried this\u2026 Georgia, of all places, did this\u2026 In Oregon there was a program to\u2026 This has worked in Kentucky\u2026.\u201d) She\u2019s smart, maybe too smart. She speaks in thick paragraphs that her staffers probably wish they could condense and sharpen at times.\n\nThe assembled crowd of about 50 in this Northwest Baltimore retirement castle have been receptive to her pitch. They stay well into the evening hours, applauding her policy planks at regular intervals. There\u2019s no sign, at least visibly, that this elderly crowd would have any hesitation about supporting a platform to legalize marijuana, presented by a 41-year-old lesbian whose short hair and flowing arm and hand gestures whiff of an even younger, star Ph.D. student preparing for her oral exam. It\u2019s a welcome sign for a campaign that\u2019s banking on the premise of an emboldened, cross-demographic progressive electorate to put her in the governor\u2019s mansion this November.\n\nBut November is hardly the problem in Maryland, a blue-as-can-be, one-party state. June\u2019s Democratic primary is the more pressing concern. And in that three-way field, she\u2019s either running in third or a tie for second, depending on how flexibly one applies margins of error. Let\u2019s call it a tie for second, because both she and the state\u2019s deeply ambitious but gaffe-prone Attorney General, Doug Gansler, who is running on a platform to roll back certain tax increases, are currently well in the rear view mirror of Lieutenant Governor Anthony Brown, whom the state party establishment has anointed. There\u2019s no question, though, that Mizeur is running on the most left-wing platform of the bunch.\n\nAnd so after a couple of policy questions, someone in the group asks that most annoying of all political questions: \u201cHow can you actually win this election?\u201d\n\n\u201cBy all you going out and voting for me on June 24th!\u201d she says.\n\nShe rattles off a couple of well-rehearsed caveats about her standing in the polls: the primary is months away, so few voters are paying attention; she\u2019s barely even begun to spend her (admittedly limited, public-finance matched) campaign funds; she\u2019s the \u201conly candidate\u201d gaining in the polls while her opponents are \u201ceither losing or holding their percentages.\u201d That last one is true, but her gain has still only been from 5 to 10 percent. She cites a Baltimore Sun editorial about this still being a \u201cwide-open race.\u201d\n\nRight now, the race between Mizeur, Gansler and Brown to replace outgoing two-termer Martin O\u2019Malley is, boringly, about name recognition. And Mizeur is the only of the three who doesn\u2019t hold a statewide-elected position. Whether this lefty is able to claw her way to the top in the home stretch, Bill de Blasio style, is a test of how progressive\u2014not just Democratic-voting\u2014the state has become in recent years.\n\n\u201cMaryland has this reputation of being \u2018blue on paper,\u2019\u201d she says, but not really \u201cdoing much\u201d with that status to lead the country in progressive innovation. The state\u2019s political debate in recent decades instead has revolved around the mundane issue of slot machines. But that\u2019s started to change in recent years, as the state legislature has passed a number of high-profile pieces of liberal legislation.\n\nThis transformation hasn\u2019t happened because of a progressive awakening in the state, yet. Instead, it\u2019s largely because Governor Martin O\u2019Malley is contemplating a presidential run. This means positioning himself and his priorities in a way that would appeal to Democratic primary voters nationwide in 2016. And so, in recent legislative sessions, the Maryland General Assembly has passed and he has signed into law bills legalizing same-sex marriage, instituting a state-level \u201cDream Act\u201d offering in-state tuition to certain undocumented immigrants, putting in place strong \u201ccommon-sense gun safety measures,\u201d and repealing the death penalty. Both the same-sex marriage and Dream Act measures were upheld by surprisingly strong margins in statewide referenda on the 2012 general election ballot.\n\nMizeur\u2019s career in state government has entirely overlapped with the O\u2019Malley administration. She was elected to the House of Delegates in 2006, the same year O\u2019Malley became governor, representing the ultra-crunchy left-wing Washington suburb of Takoma Park. And the theory behind her campaign to succeed O\u2019Malley is that Maryland voters are more progressive than their elected officials have given them credit for.\n\n\u201cThere was a stiffening of the spine, if you will, of a lot of Democrats that in their heart wanted to be in support of things that they weren\u2019t sure the electorate was for,\u201d Mizeur says in an interview. \u201cAnd once we saw the sleeping lion wake up in that 2012 election cycle, where they had their say and it was very clear where the support of Democratic voters were on progressive policy issues in our state, that created an opportunity for getting additional things done in the following session.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think that there is a growing sense among progressive activists in this state that our time has come,\u201d she says, pointing to the success of Bill de Blasio\u2019s 2013 election as mayor of New York City as a model. \u201cBill de Blasio wasn\u2019t the guy with the money, wasn\u2019t the guy who was running well [early] in the polls, wasn\u2019t the guy that anyone thought could win, but he was the person that was running on his core values, and excited the people, and pulled this thing off,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd I think that there have been a lot of similarities between the kind of campaign that he ran in New York and that we set out from day one to run here in Maryland.\u201d\n\nHer platform, then, contains nearly every next-wave energizing idea in liberal politics\u2014the sort of stuff that, she thinks, by 2016 or 2020 will be a necessary on Democratic presidential candidates\u2019 primary platforms.\n\nThe central item is a plan to legalize and tax marijuana and use the receipts to fund a pricey universal pre-kindergarten program. She wants to increase the minimum wage up to a living wage\u2014$16.70/hour and indexed to inflation\u2014gradually by 2022. She\u2019s outspoken on environmental issues and has fought the fracking industry in natural-gas rich Western Maryland. In the criminal justice system, Mizeur wants to eliminate mandatory minimum drug sentences and replace the cash bail system with a risk-assessment program. She would reinstate the state\u2019s lapsed \u201cmillionaire\u2019s tax\u201d on upper-income earners and give a modest income tax cut to everyone else; similarly, she\u2019d fund tax rebates for small businesses with the revenue derived from closing the \u201ccombined reporting\u201d loophole that allows certain large companies to avoid paying the state\u2019s corporate income tax. On health care, her immediate goals are to put in place a series of measures to make Medicaid enrollment smoother. By 2017, though, she intends to make use of an innovation waiver for which states will be eligible to \u201clook at ways to go above and beyond what was ever laid out as a vision for health reform under the Affordable Care Act\u201d\u2014meaning, perhaps, eliminating the insurance \u201cmiddleman\u201d altogether.\n\nGet The Beast In Your Inbox!

About 20 members of a local synagogue were getting an extraordinary amount of attention from a total of four Democratic and Republican gubernatorial candidates (Mizeur and Gansler were there, Brown wasn\u2019t.) Amid a number of cranky questions about why the gas tax was so damn high or why it\u2019s so friggin\u2019 hard to get from Annapolis to Baltimore, an upper-middle-aged woman named Marla asked about her long-term care insurance plan. She said her premiums have started to go up 15-20% a year and now she\u2019s worried she won\u2019t pay able to keep it.\n\nMizeur didn\u2019t even wait for Marla to finish the question. \u201cI know, I know\u2014I was a health care policy specialist in the private sector and in my time in Congress, I know about this.\u201d She explained that insurers offering these long-term care plans \u201ctake your money while you\u2019re healthy\u201d and then jack up premiums once you \u201cstart to reach an age where you might use this, hoping you\u2019ll drop your plan.\u201d She discussed a few consumer protection measures she\u2019s either sponsored or working on. (She has seemingly either sponsored or is working on a bill on everything.)\n\nHealth care policy is the issue that landed her where she is today.\n\nShe was born in the downstate Illinois town of Blue Mound in 1972 and still carries traces of the Midwest in her voice. Her father worked for Caterpillar and was a member of the United Auto Workers. Mizeur vividly describes her father taking her, when she was 9 years old, to the picket line of a six-month strike, and she claims that early taste of solidarity formed her political worldview.\n\nAfter attending from the University of Illinois (where she came out of the closet) she worked on Capitol Hill, eventually working her way up to be John Kerry\u2019s domestic policy advisor. From that perch she drafted much of Kerry\u2019s 2004 health care plan.\n\nWhile she enjoyed working with Kerry on health care\u2014\u201cHe was willing to take risks at that time that others weren\u2019t willing to take\u201d\u2014she was ready to test out her own set of progressive beliefs in her own political career. And after a stint on the Takoma Park city council and two terms in the House of Delegates, she\u2019s testing them out for the first time statewide.\n\nBut any story about statewide Democratic politics in Maryland nowadays is, in part, about Governor Martin O\u2019Malley: what he\u2019s done in Maryland, what he wants to do after Maryland, and what Maryland wants to do after him. And Mizeur wants to be the liberal true believer to O\u2019Malley\u2019s liberal opportunist.\n\nHer attitude towards O\u2019Malley is formally polite, appreciative of certain actions, but overall, cool. Some of this is put on. The frontrunner she\u2019s trying to bring down, Brown, is O\u2019Malley\u2019s lieutenant governor and heir apparent. It is not in her political interest, then, to go out of her way praising the O\u2019Malley-Brown administration. Even on issues where O\u2019Malley did the \u201cright\u201d things\u2014signing marriage equality, \u201ccommon-sense gun safety restrictions,\u201d the Dream Act\u2014she\u2019s quicker to credit an emboldened General Assembly for pushing him into making the right decision.\n\n\u201cGovernor O\u2019Malley didn\u2019t start out supporting marriage equality,\u201d she says, matter-of-factly. \u201cHe was one of these \u2018marriage is between a man and a woman\u2019 guys when I was first elected.\u201d\n\nShe pauses to take a more cutting approach. \u201cAnd it wasn\u2019t lost on us that New York succeeded [in legalizing same-sex marriage first], and Governor Cuomo and Governor O\u2019Malley are contemporaries, competing for a potential national stage.\u201d She\u2019s alluding to a fairly widely accepted public theory that O\u2019Malley only became a full-throated advocate of legalizing same-sex marriage after his possible 2016 presidential primary rival, Andrew Cuomo, enhanced his own standing by pushing it through his legislature.\n\nIs Mizeur saying that when O\u2019Malley\u2019s acted on these high-profile issues, it\u2019s been for presidential political purposes?\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to speculate.\u201d\n\nHer road to victory still will be tough, though. While polls suggest some 40 percent of Democratic primary voters are still undecided, Brown has a commanding 20 or so percent lead over Mizeur and Gansler, despite his involvement in the state\u2019s disastrous rollout of its Obamacare healthcare exchange. The incumbent Lieutenant Governor also has the support of most of the prominent Democratic establishment players and voting blocs. As Mizeur admits, it is a state with a reputation for nominating the \u201cnext guy in line,\u201d and that\u2019s Brown.\n\nEven those who think highly of Mizeur as a candidate think that name recognition alone will be enough to doom her chances.\n\n\u201cMizeur is a strong candidate with an even stronger future in the party,\u201d says Thomas Schaller, a political science professor at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, and a columnist for the Baltimore Sun. \u201cI expect her to be a statewide nominee at some point down the line.\n\n\u201cBut she\u2019s at least one cycle ahead of her time: Not because she lacks the skills or a natural constituency among Maryland liberals\u2014she has both, in fact. But because, as is almost always the case, statewide Democratic primaries in blue Maryland are crowded affairs and tough to win. And frankly, the difficulties facing House Delegates in their effort to win a Democratic gubernatorial nomination are similar to those of U.S. House members trying to win presidential nominations: Their platform is too small.\u201d\n\nBut while Mizeur may have a small platform, she\u2019s hoping that fellow Marylanders share her bold vision for the Old Line State to become that progressive haven on the Chesapeake that it\u2019s always wanted to be, if only it weren\u2019t so buttoned up. Not just a state that passes cutting-edge liberal legislation after New York has tested the waters, but a national leader.\n\n\u201cFor too long my frustration has been that Maryland sits back and sees, \u2018How does this play out in other states?\u2019 before aligning ourselves with these approaches,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd I think that we really can be a leader in establishing a new dialogue on a range of progressive policy issues that can bring about transformational change for our communities.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"twitter": {"site": "@thedailybeast", "card": "summary", "creator": "jim_newell"}, "keywords": "Maryland,United States, u.s. poli", "publicationDate": 201403110945, "wrap": "/content/dailybeast/politics", "description": "Heather Mizeur, a two-term Maryland delegate, is running for governor in an attempt to make the safely Democratic state a laboratory of liberalism.", "pageNum": 1, "title": "Could A Pro Pot Lesbian Become The Next Governor Of Maryland?", "tags": "entity:provinceorstate/maryland_united_states,topic:politics", "environment": "dev", "platform": "desktop", "template": "article", "type": "house", "parsely-page": "{\"title\":\"Could A Pro Pot Lesbian Become The Next Governor Of Maryland?\",\"link\":\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/03/11/could-a-pro-pot-lesbian-become-the-next-governor-of-maryland.html\",\"image_url\":\"http://cdn.thedailybeast.com/content/dailybeast/articles/2014/03/11/could-a-pro-pot-lesbian-become-the-next-governor-of-maryland/jcr:content/image.crop.410.273.jpg/46485364.cached.jpg\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":\"/content/dailybeast/articles/2014/03/11/could-a-pro-pot-lesbian-become-the-next-governor-of-maryland\",\"pub_date\":\"2014-03-11T09:45:00+00:00\",\"section\":\"Politics\",\"author\":\"Jim Newell\",\"tags\":[\"maryland_united_states\",\"politics\"]}", "news_keywords": "Maryland United States, US Politics", "sectionTaxanomies": "politics", "fb": {"admins": "1703087,30000737,1117577220,1276800108,931159,514915512", "app_id": 189930913679}, "authors": "Jim Newell", "article": {"section": "politics", "published_time": "2014-03-11T09:45:00.000Z", "author": "http://www.thedailybeast.com/contributors/jim-newellhtml"}, "resourceType": "dailybeast2/components/pages/article", "contentpath": "/content/dailybeast/articles/2014/03/11/could-a-pro-pot-lesbian-become-the-next-governor-of-maryland", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Beast", "description": "Heather Mizeur, a two-term Maryland delegate, is running for governor in an attempt to make the safely Democratic state a laboratory of liberalism.", "title": "Could a Pro-Pot Lesbian Become the Next Governor of Maryland?", "url": "http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/03/11/could-a-pro-pot-lesbian-become-the-next-governor-of-maryland.html", "image": "http://cdn.thedailybeast.com/content/dailybeast/articles/2014/03/11/could-a-pro-pot-lesbian-become-the-next-governor-of-maryland/jcr:content/image.img.2000.jpg/1394560944466.cached.jpg", "type": "article"}, "authorIds": "/etc/authors/j/jim-newell", "content-type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8"}, "article_summary": "Heather Mizeur, a two-term Maryland delegate, is running for governor in an attempt to make the safely Democratic state a laboratory of liberalism.\nThis could all change if Maryland decides to veer left and elect Heather Mizeur, a wonky, pro-pot married lesbian, as governor.\nBut any story about statewide Democratic politics in Maryland nowadays is, in part, about Governor Martin O\u2019Malley: what he\u2019s done in Maryland, what he wants to do after Maryland, and what Maryland wants to do after him.\nHealth care policy is the issue that landed her where she is today.\nBut because, as is almost always the case, statewide Democratic primaries in blue Maryland are crowded affairs and tough to win."}
