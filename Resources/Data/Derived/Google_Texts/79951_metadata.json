In fact, in many areas, care actually declined.\n\n\n\n\u201cAre we satisfied? Yes and no,\u201d said Jim Parker, a deputy administrator in the Department of Healthcare and Family Services and the state's point person on coordinated care. \u201cObviously we would have liked . . . to see dramatic improvement on everything, but we knew we wouldn't see it that first year.\u201d\n\n\n\nPreliminary data for 2013 shows improvement, he said.\n\nA spokeswoman for Centene did not return messages. A spokeswoman for Aetna did not provide comment.\n\n\n\nIn 2010, Aetna and Centene-IlliniCare, a unit of Centene, beat out three other carriers that bid to manage the state's first integrated care program for the most costly subset of the Medicaid population. The idea was to better manage a patient's treatment across a variety of providers, from annual checkups to a visit with a specialist to a nursing home stay, to help keep patients healthy and save money.\n\nAetna and Centene-IlliniCare are both paid on a per-member, per-month basis, with fees ranging from $118 for an intermediate care facility that's treating a person with intellectual disabilities to $3,750 for a nursing facility, according to the insurers' contracts with the state.\n\nESTIMATED $200 MILLION SAVINGS\n\n\n\nThe program was projected to save the state an estimated $200 million over five years compared with costs incurred under the fee-for-service model, which rewards physicians and hospitals for quantity over quality of service.\n\n\n\nUnder a Medicaid overhaul backed by Mr. Quinn, half of the state's 2.9 million recipients must be transferred by 2015 to a form of coordinated care, in which health care providers are rewarded for keeping costs down and penalized for poor care.\n\nThe health care industry nationwide is being rewarded financially to improve quality while reducing costs, particularly as millions more newly insured patients are expected to seek care under the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe all know we need better care,\u201d said Michael Millenson, Highland Park-based president of consultancy Health Quality Advisors LLC. \u201cWe all know we need to save money. If we can save money by improving care, that is the ethically, economically and politically smart thing to do.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe scorecard details the first full year of the program, 2012, and separates quality measures into two categories: 22 measures in which the insurers could be financially rewarded for improving quality, and 28 measures that weren't tied to potential incentives.\n\n\n\nAmong key findings:\n\n\u2022 Aetna provided care better than a state-established baseline in 20 of 22 measures tied to financial incentives but still only improved care so much that it led to rewards in just 12 measures, such as delivering beta blockers to patients with congestive heart failure.\n\n\u2022 Centene-IlliniCare delivered care below state-established baselines in nine measures tied to financial incentives. The insurer saw its largest decline \u2014 14.5 percent \u2014 from the state's baseline in following up within 30 days with patients hospitalized for mental illness.\n\n\u2022 Nationally, both Aetna and Centene were in the top 90th percentile in such measures as dispensing medication to increase airflow to the lungs; Centene was in the bottom 10th percentile for emergency department visits per 1,000 member months, and Aetna was in the bottom 10th percentile for making sure patients had annual dental visits.\n\n\n\nMr. Parker could not say exactly how much in financial rewards each insurer lost out on, but he said it was \u201cenough to get their attention\u201d and likely totaled in the tens of millions of dollars.\n\n\n\nHe said the insurers are working with the state on ways to improve quality.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe don't see this as punishment,\u201d Mr. Parker said. \u201cWe see this as a partnership to continually improve the quality. We're looking for a . . . plan to fix the things that weren't working as well as we hoped they would.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"byline": "Kristen Schorsch", "timeCrawled": "20160525_15:20:30", "categoryName": "CCB - Health Care", "published_at": "2014-1-21", "title": "Aetna, Centene lose out on millions for failing to hit key Illinois Medicaid benchmarks", "url": "http://www.chicagobusiness.com/article//NEWS03/140129973", "twitter": {"image": "http://www.chicagobusiness.com/images/logo-square-200x200.png", "site": "@CrainsChicago", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Aetna, Centene lose out on millions for failing to hit key Illinois Medicaid benchmarks"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#2d89ef", "og": {"site_name": "Crain's Chicago Business", "description": "Aetna and Centene, tasked with managing the most expensive and medically complex Illinois Medicaid enrollees, lose out on millions of dollars for failing to meet key quality benchmarks.", "title": "Insurers lose millions for failing to hit Illinois Medicaid quality benchmarks", "url": "http://www.chicagobusiness.com/article/20140121/NEWS03/140129973/insurers-lose-millions-for-failing-to-hit-illinois-medicaid-quality-benchmarks", "image": "http://www.chicagobusiness.com/images/logo-square-200x200.png", "type": "article"}, "summary": "Aetna and Centene, tasked with managing the most expensive and medically complex Illinois Medicaid enrollees, lose out on millions of dollars for failing to meet key quality benchmarks.", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=571426684", "fb": {"admins": 100001125868754}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/assets/icons/mstile-144x144.png", "content_type": "article", "taxo_Companies": "Illinois Dept. of Healthcare and Family Services", "google-site-verification": "0QcjJi4OGS9bKu4FBKK58V93fKv0WYCQb7IFbmjATew", "taxo_People": "Pat Quinn", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no, minimal-ui", "description": "Visit Crain's Chicago Business for complete business news and analysis including healthcare, real estate, manufacturing, government, sports and more."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde585\"", "article_summary": "The two insurers tapped to manage the most expensive and medically complex Illinois Medicaid recipients lost out on millions of dollars for failing to meet key quality benchmarks.\n\u201cWe all know we need better care,\u201d said Michael Millenson, Highland Park-based president of consultancy Health Quality Advisors LLC.\nIn 2010, Aetna and Centene-IlliniCare, a unit of Centene, beat out three other carriers that bid to manage the state's first integrated care program for the most costly subset of the Medicaid population.\nFor the insurers \u2014 Hartford, Conn.-based Aetna Inc. and a unit of St. Louis-based Centene Corp., which manage a combined 36,000 elderly, blind and disabled Medicaid patients \u2014 Aetna delivered better results, but both still didn't best standards set by the state enough to capture the most financial rewards they could.\nYes and no,\u201d said Jim Parker, a deputy administrator in the Department of Healthcare and Family Services and the state's point person on coordinated care."}
