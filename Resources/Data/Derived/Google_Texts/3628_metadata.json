Identifying the remains could take several days.\n\nIt was unclear how long the remains had been in the water, but a family attorney said investigators told him the body appeared to have been submerged long enough that it was difficult to identify the skin color.\n\nThe attorney, David Perecman, said the boy\u2019s mother, Vanessa Fontaine was headed to the medical examiner\u2019s office to provide a DNA sample, to compare against remains. Investigators already have a DNA sample on file from the boy\u2019s father.\n\nThe mother has acknowledged the similarities between her son and the clothes recovered from the remains, but is holding out hope until a conclusive match is made, Mr. Perecman said.\n\n\u201cHer initial reaction was \u2018until I hear more, and see more\u2019\u2026there\u2019s been a lot of bad leads,\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019s being a mom. She\u2019s not going to be convinced this is her son until there\u2019s enough to convince her.\u201d\n\nPolice received a call shortly after 7 p.m. Thursday from a woman reporting that human remains were found near Powell Cove Boulevard and Endeavor Place in the College Point neighborhood.\n\nA 14-year-old girl had been walking the shoreline taking photos when she noticed a human arm lying on the rocks, the law-enforcement official said. The girl returned home and told her parents, who called 911.\n\nNYPD Investigators and marine units arrived on the scene and identified the arm as human, cordoned off the area as a crime scene and alerted detectives who began searching for additional clues, the official said.\n\nPolice discovered two legs with blue jeans, white socks and sneakers about 15 feet from the arm, the official said, adding that investigators also recovered several other human remains, including what are believed to be rib bones and a pelvic bone.\n\nThe size 5\u00bd pair black Nike Air Jordan sneakers, the Old Navy sized 16 blue jeans and the a pair of white tube socks are similar to those worn by Avonte on the day he disappeared, the official said.\n\nAvonte, who is non-verbal and has trouble performing basic tasks, disappeared after breaking off from a group of students and leaving the Riverview School on 51st Avenue in the Long Island City through a side door on Oct. 4.\n\nMs. Fontaine received a call from detectives around 2 a.m. Friday morning.\n\nAvonte\u2019s disappearance sparked a massive, round-the-clock hunt, which involved police setting up a command center in the school. Subway workers walked along the tracks in tunnels since Avonte has a fascination with trains. Fliers were posted around the city, and a van with a speaker playing his mother\u2019s voice combed the streets while more than 200 volunteers looked for the boy.\n\nHe was last seen on a video recording inside the school running past a safety officer, who instructed him to back to his classroom, police have said. The boy ran away, and instead exited the building through an open, unguarded door and into a nearby park, which sits along the East River.\n\nMr. Perecman said Avonte had a fear of water and would not have likely gone in to the water on his own. \u201cHe\u2019s afraid of it, he doesn\u2019t like it,\u201d he said.\n\nPolice have cleared the safety officer of any wrongdoing. His mother, Vanessa Fontaine, took steps to sue the city.\n\nAlison Fox contributed to this article", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "New York City investigators were working to positively identify human remains that were found Thursday night along an East River cove in Queens, several miles from where an autistic boy walked out of school and disappeared last October.", "title": "Police Investigate Whether Human Remains Belong to Missing Autistic Teen", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/metropolis/2014/01/17/police-investigate-whether-human-remains-belong-to-missing-autistic-teen/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-BD465_0117se_P_20140117090038.jpg"}, "site": "WSJNY", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "New York", "article.headline": "Police Investigate Whether Human Remains Belong to Missing Autistic Teen", "description": "New York City investigators were working to positively identify human remains that were found Thursday night along an East River cove in Queens, several miles from where an autistic boy walked out of school and disappeared last October.", "article_section": "New York", "author": "Pervaiz Shallwani", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "Metropolis Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "Metropolis", "article.summary": "New York City investigators were working to positively identify human remains that were found Thursday night along an East River cove in Queens, several miles from where an autistic boy walked out of school and disappeared last October.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2014-01-17T14:24:41-05:00", "dj.asn": "10-159", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/metropolis/2014/01/17/police-investigate-whether-human-remains-belong-to-missing-autistic-teen/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-METROB-19625", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "New York", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "New York City investigators were working to positively identify human remains that were found Thursday night along an East River cove in Queens, several miles from where an autistic boy walked out of school and disappeared last October.", "title": "Police Investigate Whether Human Remains Belong to Missing Autistic Teen", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/metropolis/2014/01/17/police-investigate-whether-human-remains-belong-to-missing-autistic-teen/", "image": {"width": 749, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-BD465_0117se_P_20140117090038.jpg", "height": 499}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Metropolis", "article.id": "BL-METROB-19625", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2014-01-18T00:42:29-05:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe10ea\"", "article_summary": "PJ Smith for The Wall Street Journal New York Police Department searches for human remains on a shoreline in College Point, Queens on Jan. 17.\nPJ Smith for The Wall Street Journal New York Police Department searches for human remains on a shoreline in College Point, Queens, on Jan. 17.\nPJ Smith for the The Wall Street Journal New York Police Department searches for human remains along a shoreline in College Point, Queens, on Jan. 17.\nUPDATED | New York City investigators were working to positively identify human remains that were found Thursday night along an East River cove in Queens, several miles from where an autistic boy walked out of school and disappeared last October.\nA 14-year-old girl had been walking the shoreline taking photos when she noticed a human arm lying on the rocks, the law-enforcement official said."}
