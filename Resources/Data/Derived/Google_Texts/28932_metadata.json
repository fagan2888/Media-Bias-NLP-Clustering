Controversial U.S. drone strikes are down. The U.S. and Pakistan recently announced the restart of their \u201cstrategic dialogue\u201d after a long pause. Pakistan\u2019s new prime minister, Nawaz Sharif, is traveling to Washington for talks this coming week with President Barack Obama.\n\nSEE ALSO: U.S. debt jumps a record $328 billion \u2014 tops $17 trillion for first time\n\nBut in a summer dominated by foreign policy debates over the coup in Egypt and chemical weapons attacks in Syria, the U.S. hasn\u2019t promoted its revamped aid relationship with Pakistan. Neither has Pakistan.\n\nThe silence reflects the lingering mutual suspicions between the two.\n\nThe Pakistanis do not like being seen as dependent on their heavy-handed partners. The Americans are uncomfortable highlighting the billions provided to a government that is plagued by corruption and perceived as often duplicitous in fighting terrorism.\n\nCongress has cleared most of the money, and it should start moving early next year, officials and congressional aides said.\n\nOver three weeks in July and August, the State Department and the U.S. Agency for International Development informed Congress that it planned to restart a wide range of assistance, mostly dedicated to helping Pakistan fight terrorism. The U.S. sees that effort sees as essential as it withdraws troops from neighboring Afghanistan next year and tries to leave a stable government behind.\n\nOther funds focus on a range of items, including help for Pakistani law enforcement and a multibillion-dollar dam in disputed territory.\n\nU.S.-Pakistani relations have weathered numerous crises in recent years. There was a months-long legal battle over a CIA contractor who killed two Pakistanis, in addition to the fallout from bin Laden\u2019s killing in the Pakistani military town of Abbottabad in May 2011. The Pakistani government was outraged that it received no advance warning of the Navy SEAL raid on bin Laden\u2019s compound.\n\nAdding to the mistrust, the U.S. mistakenly killed two dozen Pakistani soldiers in November 2011. Islamabad responded by shutting land supply routes for troops in Afghanistan until it received a U.S. apology seven months later.\n\nThe State Department told Congress that the U.S. hadn\u2019t conducted any significant military financing for Pakistan since the \u201cchallenging and rapidly changing period of U.S.-Pakistan relations\u201d in 2011 and 2012. The department stressed the importance now of enhancing Pakistan\u2019s anti-terrorism capabilities through better communications, night vision capabilities, maritime security and precision striking with F16 fighter jets.\n\nThe department told Congress on July 25 that it would spend $295 million to help Pakistan\u2019s military. Twelve days later it announced $386 million more. A pair of notifications arriving on Aug. 13 and worth $705 million centered on helping Pakistani troops and air forces operating in the militant hotbeds of western Pakistan, and other counterinsurgency efforts.\n\nThe administration had until the end of September to provide Congress with \u201creprogramming\u201d plans at the risk of forfeiting some of the money, which spans federal budgets from 2009-2013.\n\nState Department officials said the renewal of aid wasn\u2019t determined by any single event. But they noted a confluence of signs of greater cooperation, from Pakistan\u2019s improved commitment to stamping out explosives manufacturing to its recent counterterror offensive in areas bordering Afghanistan that have served as a primary sanctuary for the Taliban.\n\nThe officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren\u2019t authorized to talk publicly about the aid relationship ahead of Sharif\u2019s visit. They said the money would start reaching Pakistan in 2014 but take several years to disburse fully.\n\nIn its notifications to Congress, the department described fighting terrorism as a mutual concern but said little about the will of Pakistan\u2019s government, army and intelligence services to crack down on militant groups that often have operated with impunity in Pakistan while wreaking havoc on U.S. and international forces across the border in Afghanistan.\n\nTop American officials have regularly questioned Pakistan\u2019s commitment to counterterrorism.\n\nIn 2011, Adm. Mike Mullen, then chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, described the militant Haqqani network as a \u201cveritable arm\u201d of Pakistani intelligence. Lawmakers and administration officials have cited Pakistani support for the Taliban, Lashkar-e-Taiba and other militant groups.\n\nIn September, the administration sent officials from multiple agencies for closed-doors briefings with the House and Senate foreign relations committees, officials and congressional aides said.\n\nThe House Foreign Affairs Committee has cleared all of the notifications. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee is reviewing a $280 million chunk of military financing, Senate aides said. Aides spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren\u2019t authorized to talk publicly on the matter.\n\n\u201cThe committee held up the projects to get more information and express concerns,\u201d said the office of Rep. Ed Royce, R-Calif., the House panel\u2019s chairman. \u201cThough they went forward, the committee continues its close oversight.\u201d\n\nWhile Washington has publicly challenged Islamabad to step up its fight against militant groups, Pakistan\u2019s biggest complaint has been the huge surge in drone strikes on terrorist targets, which Pakistanis see as violations of their sovereignty. The number of attacks has dropped dramatically this year.\n\nThe countries say they\u2019re now moving past the flaps and mishaps that soured their partnership in recent years. During an August trip to Pakistan, Secretary of State John Kerry announced the restart of a high-level \u201cstrategic dialogue\u201d with Pakistan on fighting terrorism, controlling borders and fostering investment.\n\nAmong the economic aid programs included in the U.S. package, support for the Diamer-Basha dam near Pakistan\u2019s unresolved border with India has the potential for controversy and tremendous benefit.\n\nPakistan\u2019s government has been unable to secure money for the project from the World Bank, and the Asian Development Bank is waiting to hear from the United States and India before providing financing to help construction. The dam faces massive funding shortfalls.\n\nIn its July 24 notification to Congress, USAID said the project could cost up to $15 billion and take a decade to complete. The agency promised only to provide \u201cfinancial and technical assistance\u201d for studies, including on environmental and social aspects, while expressing hope the dam could be transformative for a country with chronic power shortages. State Department officials put the bill for the studies at $20 million.\n\nIf the dam were ultimately built, USAID wrote, it could provide electricity for 60 million people and 1 million acres of crop land, and provide a ready supply of water for millions more. It noted that Pakistani officials have sought American support at the \u201chighest levels.\u201d\n\nDespite amounting to just a small portion of the overall U.S. aid package, congressional aides said Pakistan\u2019s government has lobbied particularly hard for the dam money to be unlocked.\n\nPakistan\u2019s embassy in Washington refused to comment on the aid or say if Sharif would bring up any specific programs in talks at the White House.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The U.S. has quietly decided to release more than $1.6 billion in military and economic aid to Pakistan that was suspended when relations between the two countries disintegrated over the covert raid that killed Osama bin Laden and deadly U.S. airstrikes against Pakistani soldiers.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "The U.S. has quietly decided to release more than $1.6 billion in military and economic aid to Pakistan that was suspended when relations between the two countries disintegrated over the covert raid that killed Osama bin Laden and deadly U.S. airstrikes against Pakistani soldiers.", "title": "U.S. releases $1.6 billion aid package to Pakistan", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/oct/19/us-releases-16-billion-aid-package-pakistan/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2013/10/19/united-states-pakistanjpeg-05b10.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2013/10/19/united-states-pakistanjpeg-05b10.jpg", "description": "The U.S. has quietly decided to release more than $1.6 billion in military and economic aid to Pakistan that was suspended when relations between the two countries disintegrated over the covert raid t", "card": "summary", "title": "U.S. releases $1.6 billion aid package to Pakistan"}, "Author": "Bradley Klapper", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Politics, Pakistan, Nawaz Sharif, Congress, Afghanistan"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb650\"", "article_summary": "State Department officials said the renewal of aid wasn\u2019t determined by any single event.\nState Department officials put the bill for the studies at $20 million.\nAmong the economic aid programs included in the U.S. package, support for the Diamer-Basha dam near Pakistan\u2019s unresolved border with India has the potential for controversy and tremendous benefit.\nThey said the money would start reaching Pakistan in 2014 but take several years to disburse fully.\nCongress has cleared most of the money, and it should start moving early next year, officials and congressional aides said."}
