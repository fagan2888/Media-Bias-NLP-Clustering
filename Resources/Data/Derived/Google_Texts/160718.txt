From KXAS-TV (NBC5):

Three young baby beavers were recently rescued from the flooding in East Texas that also washed away homes and caused evacuations in some areas.

Volunteers with the Animal Rehabilitation Center in Flint, near Tyler, saved the 1-week-old beavers when they were just a few days old. They were so young that they still had their umbilical cords attached.

The beavers, named Chainsaw, Buzz and Chopper, will stay at the wildlife center for about two years before being released back into the wild, volunteers said.
