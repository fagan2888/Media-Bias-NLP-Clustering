This week the trailer for Björk’s upcoming documentary, “Biophilia Live,” made its debut on The Creators Project.

The film was directed by Nick Fenton and Peter Strickland, and it documents the vibrant, psychedelic 2011 tour for her album “Biophilia.” As Fast Company points out, the tour included a woman’s choir, tesla coils and a pendulum harp. And from the looks of the trailer all of it — along with contributions from visual artists and narration by David Attenborough — is captured int he film.

The documentary will be screened all around the world. Find a location near you here, and watch the trailer below:
