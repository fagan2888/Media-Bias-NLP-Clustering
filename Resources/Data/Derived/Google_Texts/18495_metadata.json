Before this year, only Massachusetts had a rate that low.\n\nThe CDC report Wednesday also found a larger drop in the uninsured rate in states that expanded Medicaid, the government health insurance program for the poor, under ObamaCare.\n\nIn those states, the uninsured rate fell from 18.4 percent to 10.6 percent from 2013 to 2015. In other states, there was a smaller drop, from 22.7 percent to 16.8 percent.\n\nThirty states have expanded Medicaid eligibility, but other states have held out, often citing the cost of expansion. The federal government initially pays the entire cost and then scales back to covering 90 percent of the cost.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve still got states out there that, for political reasons, are not covering millions of people that they could be covering, despite the fact that the federal government is picking up the tab,\u201d President Obama said after the White House\u2019s victory on the law at the Supreme Court in June.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "The CDC report finds the uninsured rate fell by about one-third since 2013.", "description": "The CDC report finds the uninsured rate fell by about one-third since 2013.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Peter Sullivan", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "The CDC report finds the uninsured rate fell by about one-third since 2013.", "title": "16M fewer uninsured since ObamaCare, study finds", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/250911-158m-fewer-uninsured-since-obamacare-study-finds", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/article_images/obamacare_103114getty.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-04T05:25:59-05:00", "type": "article"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-04T05:25-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/250911-158m-fewer-uninsured-since-obamacare-study-finds", "dcterms.date": "2015-08-12T07:56-04:00", "dcterms.creator": "Peter Sullivan", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": ",,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-08-12T07:56:09-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-04T05:25:59-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/250911-158m-fewer-uninsured-since-obamacare-study-finds", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "The CDC report finds the uninsured rate fell by about one-third since 2013.", "card": "summary", "title": "16M fewer uninsured since ObamaCare, study finds"}, "dcterms.title": "16M fewer uninsured since ObamaCare, study finds"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca661\"", "article_summary": "The uninsured rate fell from 14.4 percent in 2013 to 9.2 percent in 2015, according to the CDC.\nThe CDC report follows other studies that have found similar drops in the uninsured rate under ObamaCare.\nOn Monday, Gallup released a survey showing the uninsured rate had fallen from 17.3 percent in 2013 to 11.7 percent.\nIn those states, the uninsured rate fell from 18.4 percent to 10.6 percent from 2013 to 2015.\nThe CDC report Wednesday also found a larger drop in the uninsured rate in states that expanded Medicaid, the government health insurance program for the poor, under ObamaCare."}
