But, you won't see all of the high salaries unless you look somewhere else.\n\nGeneral Electric CEO Jeffrey Immelt, is also upset about taxes and will look for a \u201cstate with a more pro-business environment\" if Connecticut imposes new corporate taxes on them and other big corporations around the state. Yet, GE reports Immelt's 2014 compensation was over $18 million.\n\nAt first glance, these salaries seem unfair not only because of the widening pay gap between CEO's and their employees, but because non-profit hospitals get tax breaks with the understanding they'll give back to the community. And, large private corporations get generous tax incentives to set-up shop or stay put in Connecticut, like the $400 million approved by the legislature last year to help United Technologies expand their facilities.\n\nOn the flip side, some might defend those big salaries as a small price to pay to attract executives able to manage complex systems that bring jobs and a higher quality of life to the communities in which they operate. You be the judge.\n\nIn the meantime, the latest jobs data says that while Connecticut employers added 6,400 jobs in May - many of them are low-wage service jobs that don\u2019t bring a lot of state revenue.\n\nSo, with the pay gap widening and overall economic growth sluggish, CEO pay, whether in the public or private sector, may not be the biggest problem in our economy. But, it may reflect a lack of accountability and unsustainable demand when no one is willing to give.\n\nToday, we talk about CEO pay and the state of Connecticut\u2019s economy.\n\nGUESTS:\n\nYou can join the conversation on Facebook and Twitter.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Business", "description": "Last week, non-profit Hartford HealthCare said they would cut the jobs of over 400 people if the state increased taxes on hospitals to what they say are", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "Where We Live", "og": {"url": "http://wnpr.org/post/ceo-pay-how-much-too-much", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/wnpr/files/styles/medium/public/201506/17123251389_1881fb0ba2_k.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Last week, non-profit Hartford HealthCare said they would cut the jobs of over 400 people if the state increased taxes on hospitals to what they say are", "title": "CEO Pay: How Much Is Too Much?"}, "story_id": 416210756, "twitter": {"site": "@wnpr", "card": "summary", "creator": "@@betsykap"}, "author": "Betsy Kaplan", "org_id": 0, "dc": {"title": "CEO Pay: How Much Is Too Much?"}, "nid": 42462, "datePublished": "2015-06-22", "keywords": "economy, hospitals, taxes, government", "wordCount": 606, "has_audio": 1, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdfbbb\"", "article_summary": "So, with the pay gap widening and overall economic growth sluggish, CEO pay, whether in the public or private sector, may not be the biggest problem in our economy.\nToday, we talk about CEO pay and the state of Connecticut\u2019s economy.\nAt first glance, these salaries seem unfair not only because of the widening pay gap between CEO's and their employees, but because non-profit hospitals get tax breaks with the understanding they'll give back to the community.\nGeneral Electric CEO Jeffrey Immelt, is also upset about taxes and will look for a \u201cstate with a more pro-business environment\" if Connecticut imposes new corporate taxes on them and other big corporations around the state.\nBut, it may reflect a lack of accountability and unsustainable demand when no one is willing to give."}
