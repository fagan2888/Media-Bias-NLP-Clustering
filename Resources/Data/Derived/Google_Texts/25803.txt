The night after President Obama’s State of the Union Address, radio show host Mark Levin joined Sean Hannity to discuss what – if anything – the Republicans were going to do moving forward.

“Well when it comes to Obamacare, why don’t they try repealing it first and we the people, the private sector, private industry, we’ll replace it?” Levin asked. “How about that as an idea?”

Hannity commented that House Speaker John Boehner inviting Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to speak was a good start for Congress, but Levin said he doesn’t believe the GOP will do anything against Obamacare or immigration because they’ve already funded Obamacare–and they “support” amnesty.

“So you’re asking me if these Republicans will defund Obamacare,” Levin concluded. “The answer is no. You’re asking me if these Republicans will prevent amnesty, the answer is they support it. So these Republicans are not going to do any of those things.”
