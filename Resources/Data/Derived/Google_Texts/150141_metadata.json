They had AR-15 [rifles], they had their faces covered.\u201d The open carrying of long guns is legal in Texas.\n\nSince the Paris attacks on 13 November, Salem said, CAIR has \u201cgotten a large increase in hate-crime reporting\u201d. She said that she herself had twice been verbally abused. Feces and torn pages of the Koran were thrown at a mosque in the Austin suburb of Pflugerville.\n\nCAIR\u2019s national headquarters in Washington issued a statement saying it \u201chas received more reports about acts of Islamophobic discrimination, intimidation, threats, and violence targeting American Muslims (or those perceived to be Muslim) and Islamic institutions in the past week and a half than during any other limited period of time since the 9/11 terror attacks\u201d.\n\nIt attributed the increase to \u201cthe Paris attacks and to the mainstreaming of Islamophobia by political candidates and lawmakers in the run-up to the 2016 general election\u201d as well as politicians calling for the US to stop accepting Syrian refugees and questioning whether screening processes are effective.\n\nThere are an estimated 200,000 Muslims in the Dallas-Fort Worth area. Another Dallas suburb, Garland, was the scene of a large anti-Muslim protest in January following the Charlie Hebdo massacre. In May, Garland police shot dead two gunmen at a \u201cdraw the prophet\u201d contest.\n\nThe men had spent time at a Phoenix mosque which was the site of an armed demonstration last month as part of an anti-Islam \u201cGlobal Rally for Humanity\u201d which failed to attract widespread support.\n\nIrving attracted international attention in September when Ahmed Mohamed, a 14-year-old student, was arrested for bringing a homemade clock to school that officials said resembled a bomb. He and his family have since moved to Qatar and are demanding $15m in damages.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Bureau of American Islamic Relations, which staged armed protest outside a Texas Islamic centre last week, adds to racial tensions in wake of Paris attacks, Hate Group, Islam, Muslims, Texas,", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "AUTHOR": "The Guardian", "og": {"site_name": "MintPress News", "description": "Bureau of American Islamic Relations, which staged armed protest outside a Texas Islamic centre last week, adds to racial tensions in wake of Paris attacks, Hate Group, Islam, Muslims, Texas,", "title": "Anti-Islam Hate Group Publishes Addresses Of Muslims And 'Muslim Sympathizers'", "url": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/211610-2/211610/", "image": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/3499.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Bureau of American Islamic Relations, which staged armed protest outside a Texas Islamic centre last week, adds to racial tensions in wake of Paris attacks, Hate Group, Islam, Muslims, Texas,", "creator": "@MintPressNews", "image": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/3499.jpg", "title": "Anti-Islam Hate Group Publishes Addresses Of Muslims And 'Muslim Sympathizers'", "site": "@MintPressNews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"admins": 100003161352196}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/MintpressNewsMPN", "section": "Daily Digest", "tag": "Texas", "published_time": "2015-11-27T09:08:53-05:00"}}, "article_summary": "The group, which calls itself the Bureau of American Islamic Relations, staged an armed protest outside an Islamic centre in the Dallas suburb of Irving last Saturday.\nAn anti-Islam group which staged an armed protest outside a Dallas Islamic centre has posted names and addresses of Muslims and \u201cMuslim sympathisers\u201d on its Facebook page, adding to growing tensions in north Texas following the Paris terror attacks.\nAnother Dallas suburb, Garland, was the scene of a large anti-Muslim protest in January following the Charlie Hebdo massacre.\n\u201cWe\u2019re here protesting Syrian refugees coming to America, protesting the Islamisation of America,\u201d David Wright, a spokesman, told local FOX4 News.\nThey had AR-15 [rifles], they had their faces covered.\u201d The open carrying of long guns is legal in Texas."}
