Ronald McDonald House in Wichita hosted the sixth annual Pull Tab Collection Day on Friday.

An estimated 3.9-million tabs were collected, which amounted to 2,453 pounds.

Forty schools from across Kansas participated in the Pull Tab School Contest this year.

The pull tabs are redeemed at Wichita Iron and Metal recycling center to help with operating expenses for the two Ronald McDonald Houses in Wichita.

Since 1983, the Ronald McDonald House in Wichita has served over 45,000 sick and injured children and their families.
