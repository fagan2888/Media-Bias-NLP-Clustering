(http://www.politicopro.com/proinfo)\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nTHIS TIME, IT\u2019S PERSONAL (IN PENNSYLVANIA) \u2014 \u201cSestak's last stand against the Democratic Party,\u201d by POLITICO\u2019s Burgess Everett in Drexel Hill, Pa: \u201c ... On paper, [Joe] Sestak is about everything Democrats could want in a Senate candidate: A charismatic, decorated veteran elected to the House from a swing district who nearly defeated Republican Pat Toomey in 2010, one of the toughest election years for Democrats in decades. But the independent streak that attracts voters is precisely what worries national Democrats so much about Sestak: They believe, for the second time since 2010, that he could blow a winnable Senate race because of his tendency to reject the slightest hint of marching orders from party bosses. ... Indeed, the infighting here threatens to do significant harm to Democrats' hopes in the general election in Pennsylvania, a state that's essentially a must-win for the party's hopes of wresting the Senate from Republicans.\u201d http://politi.co/1S4qRZA\n\n\u2014 DSCC TRIPLES DOWN \u2014 \u201cThe Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee is preparing to spend an additional $1.1 million on television in Pennsylvania's Democratic primary, augmenting its coordinated spending with Katie McGinty with new independent expenditures as she tries to catch\" Sestak. http://politico.pro/1TCQbF8 \u2026 \u201cThe Environmental Defense Fund's political arm plans to spend six figures backing\" McGinty. http://politico.pro/1TCQPmh\n\n\u2014 Meanwhile, Braddock Mayor John Fetterman released a new ad on the damage fracking is doing to Pennsylvania\u2019s environment on Wednesday. https://youtu.be/Pr5DFxePyAY\n\n\u2014 Taking attendance: In his campaign advertising, Sestak touts an outsized role in passing the Affordable Care Act, but a former Hill aide notes Sestak was running for Senate at the same time Obamacare was under consideration and missed 84 percent of his Education and Labor Committee hearings, even missing a 2009 hearing on the House\u2019s more liberal proposal. The staffer said Sestak\u2019s claims are \u201csomething out of fantasyland.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Sestak\u2019s campaign countered that the congressman was on three committees rather than the typical two and also served on a special panel on defense reform, and said Sestak was there for every vote on the Affordable Care Act in the committee and on the House floor. Sestak's campaign also noted then-Majority Leader Steny Hoyer said Sestak was the most productive member of his freshman class. Lastly, the campaign said Sestak missed some hearings to take care of his daughter as she recovered from her brain tumor.\n\nWHAT WEALTH BUYS \u2014 \"How self-funders can run for Congress differently,\" by Campaign Pro's Kevin Robillard: \"Big-spending Democrat David Trone made an immediate splash when he leapt into the race for Rep. Chris Van Hollen's House seat this winter and started spending his own fortune on TV ads. But in reality, Trone dipped his toes into the Maryland district for months before declaring his candidacy \u2014 highlighting some of the many advantages self-funding candidates have over those who have to raise money to run for office, and raising legal questions from a campaign finance watchdog. http://politico.pro/22ewML2\n\nDays until the New York primary: 12.

The former football star and businessman spoke to Campaign Pro from his ranch, which plays home to one dog, three cats, a dozen horses and another dozen chickens.\n\n\u2014 On Merrick Garland: \u201cLet\u2019s not pick a fight we\u2019ve already won. Republicans already control the Senate, so if Judge Garland doesn\u2019t meet the standards that Republicans have, then he\u2019ll get rejected. That changes the dynamic, from us being obstructionist to us showing we\u2019ve done our job and not approved him.\u201d\n\n\u2014 On switching his party affiliation from Democrat to Republican last year: \u201cI was raised in a Democratic family \u2026 it was kind of habit. As an adult, I behaved as a Republican. I supported Pete Wilson in the 90s, and I supported Bush as well. My adult behavior is different, but I was too busy raising a family and running a business, so my party affiliation was irrelevant to me.\"\n\n\u2014 On state Rep. Jon Keyser\u2019s establishment support: \u201cI think Keyser is a smart, capable guy and at the same time, who you align yourself with and why you\u2019re running can influence how you behave and conduct yourself. I\u2019m not a career politician, I\u2019m not obligated to anyone but to the people of Colorado.\u201d\n\n\u2014 On why criticisms of Democratic Sen. Michael Bennet were conspicuously absent in the debate: \u201cThe first task is let Republicans know who and what we are. But the election is on June 28, so on June 29, the conversation will change.\u201d Read the full interview here: http://politico.pro/1SCpBXU\n\n\u2014 BENNET TAKES TO THE AIR \u2014 The Colorado senator released his first TV ad, touting his work with farmers and breweries: http://bit.ly/1PVqLM4\n\nRECRUITING STATION \u2014 First Democrat announces for WI-08 open seat: Outagamie County Executive Tom Nelson is planning to announce a run in Wisconsin\u2019s 8th District, becoming the first Democrat in the race to fill retiring GOP Rep. Reid Ribble\u2019s seat. Nelson is also a former state Assembly majority leader and has previously been discussed as a possible 2018 gubernatorial candidate. President Barack Obama carried the seat in 2008, but Mitt Romney beat him there in 2012. The Republican field is still shaping up, with Mike Gallagher, a Iraq veteran who advised Gov. Scott Walker\u2019s presidential campaign, and state Sen. Frank Lasee already in the race.\n\nQ1 ROUNDUP \u2014 SENATE \u2014 Louisiana: Louisiana State Treasurer John Kennedy raised more than $800,000 for his Senate bid in the first quarter of 2016 and has about $700,000 on hand, his campaign said. http://politico.pro/1SBn2Fx Kentucky: Democratic Lexington Mayor Jim Gray has $1.5 million on hand for his challenge to Kentucky GOP Sen. Rand Paul, his campaign said today, after raising $750,000 and loaning himself another $1 million in the first quarter. http://politico.pro/1RYIOFN Arkansas: Democrat Conner Eldridge raised $300,000 in the first quarter, Roll Call reported. http://bit.ly/1RQlmrT\n\nHOUSE \u2014 PA-08: Democrat Steve Santarsiero raised over $400,000 for the open-seat race. (Release.) MN-03: Democrat Jon Tollefson raised $86,000 in the first quarter of 2016 for his challenge to GOP Rep. Erik Paulsen. (Release.)\n\nETHICS PROBLEMS \u2014 \u201cShuster on defense in reelection over lobbyist girlfriend,\u201d by POLITICO\u2019s Jake Sherman and Anna Palmer: \u201cArt Halvorson's campaign message is unambiguous. He says his Republican primary opponent, Rep. Bill Shuster, is part of the D.C. 'cartel' \u2014 an unholy axis of longtime Washington politicians and lobbyists who do the bidding of Big Business instead of representing their constituents. ... Shuster has long brushed off those charges, saying his romantic relationship with Shelley Rubino, one of the top lobbyists for Airlines for America, is completely above board. Despite his girlfriend representing an industry with billions of dollars on the line in front of his committee, Shuster has refused to recuse himself from legislation dealing with the airline industry. ... But as Shuster fights to fend off Halvorson and win a ninth term in Congress, his relationship with Rubino has become an issue ahead of the April 26 primary.\u201d http://politi.co/1Sd0dra\n\n\u2014 In Case You Missed It: Glenn Thrush podcast, \"Hillary Clinton has had enough of Bernie Sanders\": In an exclusive interview for POLITICO's 'Off Message' podcast, the former secretary of state compares Donald Trump to foreign demagogues and says she's not even sure her primary opponent is a Democrat.

But the Democratic presidential front-runner stands poised to bludgeon her general election opponent with Republicans\u2019 favorite political superweapon: the Supreme Court\u2019s Citizens United decision, which earlier this decade launched a new era of unbridled fundraising.\u201d http://bit.ly/1TCW0T4\n\n\u2014 \u201cBernie's big breakthrough,\u201d by POLITICO\u2019s Steven Shepard: \u201cAs he pursues his uphill climb to defeat Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders appears to be making considerable progress in winning over key segments of the Democratic electorate that had been cool to his candidacy in the past, according to a POLITICO analysis of polling data. In Wisconsin Tuesday, one of his most consequential victories to date, the Vermont senator found a favorable electorate: Whites made up a higher percentage of the vote there than in all but four of the 20 states where entrance and exit polls have been conducted thus far. He beat his previous performance \u2014 as measured by an aggregation of exit and entrance polls in 20 of the 32 states \u2014 among a wide array of demographic and ideological groups by at least 10 percentage points, including among older voters and racial minorities who've been more resistant to his campaign.\u201d http://politi.co/23cYhuo\n\n\u2014 \u201cHillary Clinton's union problem,\u201d by POLITICO\u2019s Maggie Severns: \u201cTeachers unions were among the earliest and most enthusiastic supporters of Hillary Clinton, with the American Federation of Teachers calling her \u201cthe champion working families need\u201d and powerful AFT President Randi Weingarten hugging her on stage. The only hitch in Clinton\u2019s plans to rally this vital Democratic constituency: Teachers aren\u2019t fully on board. Bernie Sanders netted more money from people who listed themselves as teachers and educators than Clinton in February, according to a POLITICO analysis of FEC records. ... The division between leaders and rank-and-file members of teachers unions reflects a campaign in which Clinton has won overwhelming support from leaders of Democratic constituencies but struggled to beat back the Sanders challenge among average voters.\u201d http://politi.co/25M48W4\n\nCODA \u2014 QUOTE OF THE DAY: \u201cSo, folks, I think you can forget about him,\u201d Trump on Cruz and his New York values, POLITICO reported. http://politi.co/1PVy3j7\n\n** A message from Sinclair Broadcast Group: News, opinions, and entertainment surround us 24/7, yet a fundamental truth remains, whether for competitive races or impactful ballot measures, the TV commercial reigns as the medium for reaching potential voters.
