A workshop held today on the iBudget is just one small step in a much longer narrative.\n\n\n\nBack in 2011, The APD\u2019s iBudget was just getting its start as a new method to divvy up funds for the state\u2019s Medicaid Waiver program. That program funds helpful services for disabled Floridians.\n\nBut then came objections from people like Jim Freyvogel, who runs the MacDonald Training Center in Tampa. He didn\u2019t like the way the APD was determining who got funding.\n\n\u201cAs conceived, the individual concept is a really a noble attempt to efficiently and effectively fund service needs for individuals, but, if implemented, is really nothing more than a methodology employed by the APD to ration services for the sole purpose of backing into its legislative appropriation,\u201d Freyvogel told WFSU last year.\n\nLast September, in the final of three lawsuits calling the APD\u2019s formula into question, a state appeals court ruled the ADP could not allocate less than what their algorithm allowed.\n\nAPD is holding workshops with the public to decide how it will alter the iBudget program in keeping with the court\u2019s decision. Suzanne Sewell, president of the Florida Association of Rehabilitation Facilities, was one of many people who voiced their opinions.\n\n\u201cThe point I want to make is that people are not algorithms,\u201d Sewell said, \u201cand we feel very strongly that the review process needs to be added back in.\u201d\n\nDenise Arnold, Deputy Director of Programs for the APD, led the meeting.\n\n\u201cThis is not the first hearing we\u2019ve done,\u201d Arnold said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got some good feedback and good participation from stakeholders, with specific content they\u2019d like to see in the rule, and we\u2019ve made most of those changes every time we meet.\u201d\n\nArnold says this isn\u2019t the last meeting, but they are winding down a bit. She sees the process as a way to make lemonade out of the court\u2019s lemons, and use it as a chance to refine the program.\n\n\u201cI think what we\u2019re hoping to accomplish with this meeting is to try and get some stability and final decisions on how the program will operate, so that people who get the service are clear on how it operates,\u201d Arnold said.\n\nAs the agency revises its funding process, state lawmakers are upping their financial contributions by adding more money to the program. There are about 20,000 disabled Floridians on a waiting list for services the APD funds.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"category": "HNF Stories", "description": "After a flurry of court hearings taking aim at the Agency for Persons with Disabilities, the agency must now rewrite some of their rules on how disability", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://health.wusf.usf.edu/post/apds-ibudget-system-getting-overhaul", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/shared/npr/styles/medium/nprshared/201503/394923348.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "After a flurry of court hearings taking aim at the Agency for Persons with Disabilities, the agency must now rewrite some of their rules on how disability", "title": "APD's \"iBudget\" System Getting an Overhaul"}, "story_id": 394923317, "twitter": {"site": "@HealthNewsFL", "card": "summary", "creator": "@HealthNewsFL"}, "author": "Matthew Seeger", "org_id": 390, "dc": {"title": "APD&#039;s &quot;iBudget&quot; System Getting an Overhaul"}, "nid": 10032, "datePublished": "2015-03-24", "keywords": "iBudget, Agency for Persons with Disabilites, Florida Legislature 2015", "wordCount": 543, "has_audio": 1, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "Back in 2011, The APD\u2019s iBudget was just getting its start as a new method to divvy up funds for the state\u2019s Medicaid Waiver program.\nAPD is holding workshops with the public to decide how it will alter the iBudget program in keeping with the court\u2019s decision.\nThere are about 20,000 disabled Floridians on a waiting list for services the APD funds.\nThat program funds helpful services for disabled Floridians.\nA workshop held today on the iBudget is just one small step in a much longer narrative."}
