Aylesford \u2026\n\n\"The house was set in a wonderful time warp as nothing had been changed [since before] World War II\u2014we even had an outside lavatory and a coal bunker,\" Mrs. Davis says. Aylesford \u2026\n\nWith interior designer Joanna Wood, \"we took the house back to the brick walls, excavated a full basement and only kept the internal staircase,\" she says. \"This enabled us to change the layout of all the floors to make use of the space in the best possible way. We created the perfect family home with plenty of room for entertaining and houseguests.\" Aylesford \u2026\n\nThe 6,202-square-foot house has 4/5 receptions and seven bathrooms. The dining room can handle up to 20 guests, and the breakfast room has space for eight. Aylesford \u2026\n\nThe kitchen is very spacious. Mrs. Davis loves the location, too. Chelsea has \"a wonderful neighborhood feel, with lots of green spaces, restaurants and cafes and low-built homes.\" The road, Mulberry Walk, has private security patrols. London City Airport is about 30 minutes' drive away, and Heathrow Airport is about the same.
