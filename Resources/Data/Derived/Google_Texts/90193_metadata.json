The measure tripled the state\u2019s previous waiting period, and made Missouri the third state in the country to impose such a requirement, behind Utah and South Dakota. (Like South Dakota, Missouri\u2019s waiting period law provides no exceptions for victims of rape or incest. Utah\u2019s law includes these exceptions, which doesn\u2019t actually make it any less punitive.)\n\nReproductive rights activists and state Democrats protested forcefully both before and after the measure passed, and Democratic Gov. Jay Nixon vetoed the bill at the time, calling it \u201cextreme and disrespectful.\u201d But on Wednesday, Republicans used a special veto session to resuscitate the measure, and voted to override the governor\u2019s veto. Senate Democrats attempted to filibuster the bill, but Republicans cut off debate and forced a vote. The law will go into effect in 30 days.\n\nRepublicans called the new requirement a \u201creflection\u201d period. \u201c[If] you get couple of more days to think about this pregnancy, think about where it\u2019s going, you may change your mind,\u201d said Republican state Rep. Kathie Conway. (This is not correct.)\n\nNow in addition to waiting three days before being able to access care, a person seeking an abortion must also receive mandatory counseling. This counseling is designed to misinform patients and discourage them from obtaining an abortion. The counseling must also take place before the waiting period begins, requiring at least two visits to the clinic. There is only one clinic left in the state, so for anyone traveling long distances, that means finding a place to stay. Which means taking time off work. And because many people seeking abortion already have children, it means finding childcare. Which means means finding the money to pay for all of it \u2014 including the abortion.\n\nFor people in the state who do have insurance through the state\u2019s health exchange under the Affordable Cart Act, anti-choice laws prohibit that insurance from covering abortion except when the person\u2019s life in endangered. Same goes for public employees, who can only use their insurance to pay for basic healthcare if they are more or less on the verge of death. (Missouri has not adopted the Medicaid expansion, but, even so, public funding for the procedure is only available in cases of life endangerment.)", "article_metadata": {"description": "Republicans voted to override the governor's veto of a punitive waiting period law -- in the name of \"reflection\"", "author": "Katie McDonough", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Republicans voted to override the governor's veto of a punitive waiting period law -- in the name of \"reflection\"", "title": "Missouri GOP enacts law to give women\u2019s tiny brains 72 hours to understand what an abortion is", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/09/11/missouri_gop_enacts_law_to_give_womens_tiny_brains_72_hours_to_understand_what_an_abortion_is/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/09/woman_clock.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Republicans voted to override the governor's veto of a punitive waiting period law -- in the name of \"reflection\"", "creator": "@kmcdonovgh", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/09/woman_clock.jpg", "title": "Missouri GOP enacts law to give women\u2019s tiny brains 72 hours to understand what an abortion is", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Missouri GOP enacts law to give women\u2019s tiny brains 72 hours to understand what an abortion is", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Abortion, abortion rights, GOP, mandatory counseling laws, mandatory waiting periods, Missouri, reproductive health, reproductive justice, Reproductive Rights, Republicans, TRAP laws", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0841\"", "article_summary": "(Like South Dakota, Missouri\u2019s waiting period law provides no exceptions for victims of rape or incest.\nWhich means means finding the money to pay for all of it \u2014 including the abortion.\nTopics: Abortion, abortion rights, GOP, mandatory counseling laws, mandatory waiting periods, Missouri, reproductive health, reproductive justice, Reproductive Rights, Republicans, TRAP laws, Politics NewsEarlier this year, the Republican-led Missouri state legislature voted to enact a 72 hour waiting period for any person seeking an abortion.\nThe counseling must also take place before the waiting period begins, requiring at least two visits to the clinic.\nAnd because many people seeking abortion already have children, it means finding childcare."}
