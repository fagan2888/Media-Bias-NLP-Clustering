But he didn\u2019t mention that figure referred only to private-sector jobs, while government jobs have fallen by a half-million during that time.\n\nSEE ALSO: Obama decries \u2018politics,\u2019 downplays terror threat in final State of the Union\n\nTraveling to the heartland a day after his speech, Mr. Obama stuck to the 14 million figure but this time made clear that it didn\u2019t include government job losses.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in the midst of the longest streak of private-sector job creation in history \u2014 14 million new jobs,\u201d he said Wednesday at the University of Nebraska in Omaha.\n\nThe net gain of jobs since January 2009 is about 9.3 million, because more than 4 million jobs were lost during the first year of Mr. Obama\u2019s presidency. Similarly, his citing of 900,000 manufacturing jobs created \u201cin the past six years\u201d omitted the fact that manufacturing jobs have declined overall by 230,000 since Mr. Obama took office.\n\nThe private sector gained 14 million jobs since February 2010, when losses reached their peak.\n\nThe president\u2019s claim that he has cut budget deficits by \u201calmost three-quarters\u201d overlooks the fact that he contributed about $200 billion to the deficit with increased spending in fiscal 2009, when the deficit hit $1.4 trillion. In fiscal 2015, which ended Sept. 30, the annual deficit was $439 billion.\n\nOf course, Mr. Obama didn\u2019t mention that the total national debt is on a course to nearly double during his presidency, to close to $20 trillion by the time he leaves office.\n\nThe president also credited Obamacare with slowing the rate of increases in health care costs. \u201cNearly 18 million people have gained coverage so far,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cAnd in the process, health care inflation has slowed.\u201d\n\nBut the facts don\u2019t bear out a correlation. Health care spending began to slow down in 2009, a year before Congress enacted the Affordable Care Act. As noted by FactCheck.org, health care costs rose in 2014, \u201ca year in which the major coverage provisions of the law went into effect, including the establishment of the health care exchanges and expansion of Medicaid.\u201d\n\nMr. Obama also painted a too-rosy picture of his record on energy, saying wind power\u2019s price has dropped during his tenure to below the cost of \u201cdirtier conventional power.\u201d He also said the U.S. has cut imports of foreign oil by \u201cnearly 60 percent.\u201d\n\nBut the federal Energy Information Administration\u2019s figures undercut that claim. The EIA\u2019s latest data show imports of foreign crude oil dropped from 303 million barrels in January 2009 to 221 million barrels in October 2015 \u2014 a reduction of just 27 percent.\n\nEvaluating the price of wind energy is more complicated because of the many factors involved. The EIA projects that for power plants coming online in 2020, the cost of wind power will have dropped below that of coal and all other sources of energy, with the exceptions of geothermal and some types of natural gas.\n\nBut a July study led by academics at Utah State University said that when government subsidies are factored as part of the cost, wind energy becomes far less competitive, undercutting arguments such as the one by Mr. Obama.\n\n\u201cThe true cost of wind energy is higher than most cost estimates calculate,\u201d the researchers concluded. \u201cU.S. policymakers have essentially decided that electricity consumers will have wind energy, even if it is more expensive.\u201d\n\nAlso on Wednesday, Mr. Obama said Republican presidential candidates are full of \u201cbaloney\u201d with their criticism that America has become weaker on his watch and called it \u201cweird\u201d that some Republicans failed to applaud America\u2019s strength during his State of the Union address.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not true when you hear folks talking about how America\u2019s so weak,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cIt\u2019s bluster. It\u2019s not serious. There\u2019s another word for it that starts with a \u2018b\u2019 \u2014 it\u2019s baloney.\u201d\n\nThe president said he found it odd that some Republican lawmakers didn\u2019t clap when he proclaimed during his speech that the U.S. is the strongest nation on earth.\n\n\u201cIt was strange that some in the chamber didn\u2019t agree and applaud with that,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cThat\u2019s kind of a weird thing. That should not be a controversial statement. We can all clap about that. But that\u2019s how crazy our politics has gotten. We now feel obliged to not root for America doing good.\u201d\n\nThe president evoked guffaws from the audience when he apparently couldn\u2019t remember how many years the U.S. has been a country.\n\n\u201cThe United States of America for 250 years has been working to make us the strongest, but that should not be a controversial statement,\u201d he said to laughter.\n\nAmericans will celebrate the 240th birthday of their country on July Fourth.", "article_metadata": {"description": "NEWS ANALYSIS: In the bid to shape his legacy, President Obama played fast and loose with the facts Tuesday night during his final State of the Union address.", "Author": "Dave Boyer", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "NEWS ANALYSIS: In the bid to shape his legacy, President Obama played fast and loose with the facts Tuesday night during his final State of the Union address.", "title": "Obama twisted facts in State of Union speech", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/jan/13/obama-twisted-facts-state-union-speech/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2016/01/13/Obama_State_of_Union.JPEG-080b9.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2016/01/13/Obama_State_of_Union.JPEG-080b9.jpg", "title": "Obama twisted facts in State of Union speech", "description": "NEWS ANALYSIS: In the bid to shape his legacy, President Obama played fast and loose with the facts Tuesday night during his final State of the Union address.", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "news_keywords": "Business Finance"}, "article_summary": "NEWS ANALYSIS:In the bid to shape his legacy, President Obama played fast and loose with the facts Tuesday night during his final State of the Union address.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not true when you hear folks talking about how America\u2019s so weak,\u201d Mr. Obama said.\n\u201cAnd in the process, health care inflation has slowed.\u201dBut the facts don\u2019t bear out a correlation.\nHealth care spending began to slow down in 2009, a year before Congress enacted the Affordable Care Act.\nThe private sector gained 14 million jobs since February 2010, when losses reached their peak."}
