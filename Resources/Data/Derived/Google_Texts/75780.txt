The Kansas Department of Aging and Disability Services is taking control of the Deseret Health Care facility in Southeast Wichita.

Agency Commissioner Joe Ewert says, "The facility ownership over the operations, Deseret Health Group, contacted us last week and indicated to us they were insolvent."

About the same time last week several Deseret employees contacted KAKE news that Deseret didn't pay them which we reported on last Friday. Employees then expressed their concern about their own financial problems with not getting paid but also concern for the future of the care facility and their job future.

Commissioner Ewert says, "We're going to the facility today and will enter with a team essentially that will be able to assess the condition of the residents, assess the building, assess the status of the staff. There is a number of staff who have not received a paycheck since the previous pay period. So, we'll go in, meet with the staff, meet with the residents. We'll provide the assurance that they need, specifically the staff that they need to keep coming to work. We'll get them paid and we'll take care of the residents."

He says while the state takes operational control it'll also be seeking other parties which might be interested in taking over the facility to operate it.
