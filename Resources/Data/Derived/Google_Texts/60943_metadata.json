The next round did not begin until Dec. 10. Issa also said that Sebelius\u2019 claim that MITRE recommended HHS proceed with the launch of the website was also false, because MITRE says it was never consulted. The Republican investigator also disputes Sebelius\u2019 statement that \u201cno one\u2026 suggested that the risks outweighed the importance of moving forward.\u201d\n\nIn a Sept. 24 memo, Fryer warned that HealthCare.gov \u201cdoes not reasonably meet the CMS security requirements,\u201d saying she lacked confidence that personal information could be protected on the site.\n\nThe Department of Health and Human Services is disputing the security issues.\n\n\u201cThere have been no successful security attacks on Healthcare.gov and no person or group has maliciously accessed personally identifiable information,\u201d Peters said in her email to the Examiner. \u201cAn independent security control assessor tested each piece of the Healthcare.gov system that went live Oct. 1 prior to that date with no open high findings. All high, moderate and low security risk findings listed on the SCAs for the portions of the website that launched Oct. 1 were either fixed, or have strategies and plans in place to fix the findings that meet industry standards.\u201d\n\nWatch the latest video at video.foxnews.com", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.4.3", "og": {"site_name": "BizPac Review", "description": "A congressional leader has warned Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius that her testimony on Obamacare may result in perjury charges. \u201cWitnesses who purposely give false or misleading testimony during a congressional hearing may be subject to criminal liability under Section 1001 of Title of 18 of the U.S. Code, which prohibits \u2018knowingly and \u2026", "title": "Sebelius may face perjury charges, Darrell Issa warns in letter", "locale": {"alternate": "en_US", "identifier": "en_US"}, "image": "http://www.bizpacreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/sebelius-pointing-to-self-afp.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-01-10T06:38:22+00:00", "url": "http://www.bizpacreview.com/2014/01/09/sebelius-may-face-perjury-charges-darrell-issa-warns-in-letter-93199", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"widgets": {"csp": "on"}}, "alexaVerifyID": "qC73ojZoktel85cbl12SAFJar9k", "fb": {"admins": "10152426200106417,10152720237657852,10200650572686956,3854753687919,100215693385946,549853448412696", "pages": 169204449790211, "app_id": 1502886339979348}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/ConservativeNewsToday", "section": "News", "published_time": "2014-01-09T08:12:27+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-01-10T06:38:22+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "A congressional leader has warned Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius that her testimony on Obamacare may result in perjury charges.\n\u201cProviding false or misleading testimony to Congress is a serious matter,\u201d Issa said in the letter.\nIssa also said that Sebelius\u2019 claim that MITRE recommended HHS proceed with the launch of the website was also false, because MITRE says it was never consulted.\nThe Department of Health and Human Services is disputing the security issues.\n\u201cAn independent security control assessor tested each piece of the Healthcare.gov system that went live Oct. 1 prior to that date with no open high findings."}
