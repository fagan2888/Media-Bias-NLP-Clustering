Bobby Jindal declared that it was time for the GOP to \u201cstop being the stupid party.\u201d Twenty months later, Jindal is hard at work trying to make that the case.\n\nThe boyish-looking 43-year-old Republican is closing in on a decision whether to run for the White House in 2016, but first he is criss-crossing the country fundraising for GOP candidates and for his policy organization, America Next. The group has already outlined his proposals to repeal and replace Obamacare, with future plans on education reform and energy policy coming in the coming months.\n\n\n\nIn a Republican Party divided over tactics and policy, Jindal is trying to carve out a niche as the wonkiest candidate. On the stump at a fundraiser for Tennessee State Sen. Jack Johnson Sunday, Jindal reiterated his calls for the GOP to offer up policy alternatives, not just objections, delivering a thinly-veiled critique of New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie.\n\nDressed casually in jeans and a button down shirt, with an oversized New Orleans Saints belt buckle, Jindal appears unassuming sitting on a sofa backstage before the event. But then he starts talking. And fast. 180-words-per-minute fast, his much-maligned 2009 response to Obama\u2019s first speech to a joint session of Congress notwithstanding. He touches on policy areas like education and immigration, healthcare and the Middle East.\n\nHe jokes that his father, an immigrant from India had an accent. \u201cThis is not an accent by the way,\u201d he says in his thick Cajun drawl, drawing a laugh from the 500 or so attendees at the \u2018Boots & Jeans, BBQ & Beans\u2019 event. \u201cThis is how regular people talk.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know we can get rid of debt, we can get rid of those taxes, those regulations, and the incompetence with a new majority and a new administration in DC,\u201d he continues. \u201cBut the thing that worries me the most is this president\u2019s relentless attempts to redefine the American dream.\u201d\n\nTIME caught up with Jindal in Franklin, Tenn. Sunday afternoon, where he was attending the fundraiser and meeting with donors for America Next to discuss his tenure and future aspirations.\n\nThe following exchange has been edited and condensed.\n\nVice President Joe Biden told the nation\u2019s governors on Friday that the nation is looking to them to lead the country out of the current era of hyper-partisanship. What was your reaction to that?\n\nI think there\u2019s deep, deep frustration with D.C., and not just in the Republican party but across the country in the Democratic party as well. I think there\u2019s a sense that the real divide is not Democrats versus Republicans, but it\u2019s between D.C. and the rest of the country. I think ironically president Obama tapped into that in 2008. When he was running, when he talked about changing the culture in D.C. He talked about bridging the partisan divides. And I think there were a lot of voters who voted for him thinking he was being less ideological, he was being more competent, he wasn\u2019t going to be hyperpartisan, and they are deeply disappointed.\n\nDo you think that Republicans who say the party needs to stop trying to repeal Obamacare are leading the GOP astray?\n\nLook, I personally think we have got to repeal it. I think we\u2019ve got to replace it. I think we have to rip it out at the roots. And I think it is awful in terms of the effects you\u2019re seeing. It was passed because of a bunch of lies. . . . I think as Republicans, yes we need to be consistent on repeal, but have to be very specific about what we are replacing it with. And I do think we do ourselves a disservice is all we say is we\u2019re repealing it and not saying this is what comes next. The more people experience it, the less they like it. But they want to know what\u2019s the alternative, they want to know, all right I know this isn\u2019t working but what are you going to do. And that\u2019s why we put our plans, our ideas forward. And I think it\u2019s incumbent upon Republicans to do the same.\n\nEighteen months ago you warned the GOP against remaining the \u201cstupid party.\u201d Where does that stand now?\n\nThree things: One I think we\u2019ve made progress, but there is more work to be done. Second, I think it\u2019s important we continue to be specific about our policy proposals. My third point is this: My big concern for our party is that in 2014 the temptation\u2019s going to be\u2014listen, I think Republicans are going to have a big year this year. All the trends seem to suggest that. And I think that we can take away the wrong lesson. My worry is that there are a lot of consultants in DC who are running around saying just run against Obamacare. It\u2019s very unpopular, be against a president whose poll numbers are falling, and don\u2019t give them anything to shoot at. That may or may not work in the short term, but there are two problems with that. One, that\u2019s no way to govern. We have to earn the right to be the majority party for the long term. And second, if as conservatives we really think these are dangerous times for our country, if we really believe that, we need to be in the business of persuading people, trying to change the direction of government, getting the country back on track. And you can\u2019t do that unless you are willing to put out specific ideas.\n\nYou\u2019ve made education reform a signature issue in Louisiana, as have other Republicans on the national level. Do you think the issue is a political opportunity for the GOP?\n\nI think it\u2019s a huge issue for conservatives. And I say this seriously. I don\u2019t think this should be a partisan issue. I think it\u2019s an American issue. . . . The left has abandoned a lot of these kids and their families and they really don\u2019t have much to say to them. You can\u2019t tell them to just wait, because their kids only grow up once. Incremental progress isn\u2019t enough. And what you\u2019re seeing is you\u2019re seeing amazing progress in a really short period of time. So for example in charter schools in New Orleans, in five years they have doubled the percentage of kids who are reading at grade level. This isn\u2019t just theory\u2014you can show dramatic progress quickly for folks. So I think it is the right issue substantively, so that\u2019s the reason I think pursuing it shouldn\u2019t just be a partisan issue. But secondly, certainly there are political benefits to Republicans, sure, and I think it\u2019s a great example of how we can be consistent with our principles and speak to every voter.\n\nWhat do you make of the surge of unaccompanied minors crossing the southern border?\n\nI think the president has played a role in helping to create the crisis we see on the southern border. It\u2019s time for him to secure the border. I know he keeps looking for people to blame. He has to look in the mirror. The reality of it is this, we don\u2019t need 1,000-page bills, right now we need to secure the border. As conservatives we talk a lot about this being the most ideological, the most liberal president. But I think the public\u2019s also seeing an incompetent administration as well. We\u2019ve seen that with the VA, we\u2019ve seen that, I believe, with the release of the five prisoners from Gitmo. I think you see that with the border situation. I think you\u2019ve seen that with the IRS. You\u2019ve seen that example in case after case.\n\nIt\u2019s time for him to secure the border, but I think this is also telling in that it goes to the competence of the administration. And I think that\u2019s something that we\u2019ve seen in Louisiana for a while. We saw it especially during the oil spill, the explosion in 2010. We saw the incompetence there. I think the rest of the country is seeing what we saw back then.\n\nWhat\u2019s the latest on your 2016 thinking?\n\nWe\u2019ve said it\u2019s something we\u2019re thinking about, praying about. It\u2019s something we\u2019re considering. But we won\u2019t make a decision until certainly after November.", "article_metadata": {"apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0", "description": "Says GOP must put forward ideas to \"earn the right to be the majority party.\"", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "TIME.com", "description": "Says GOP must put forward ideas to \"earn the right to be the majority party.\"", "title": "Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal Explains His Vision for a Path to Victory in 2016", "url": "http://time.com/2983445/louisiana-governor-bobby-jindal-explains-his-vision-for-a-path-to-victory-in-2016/", "image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/bobby-jindal-chris-christie.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1012", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/bobby-jindal-chris-christie.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1012"}, "title": "Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal Explains His Vision for a Path to Victory in 2016", "description": "Says GOP must put forward ideas to \"earn the right to be the majority party.\"", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "TIME"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-tooltip": "Current & Breaking News | National & World Updates", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "p": {"domain_verify": "f48a8936c3fffc943fce516f2e3ff1d2"}, "fb": {"app_id": 53177223193}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/time2014/img/time-touch_icon_152.png", "application-name": "TIME", "keywords": "2016 election, bobby jindal, governor, louisiana, newsmaker interview", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/time", "author": "https://facebook.com/zekejmiller"}, "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://time.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/2cee445ea71a179ffd35ea91cf154905?s=16", "news_keywords": "bobby jindal, governor, 2016 election, interview"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe025e\"", "article_summary": "We\u2019ve seen that with the VA, we\u2019ve seen that, I believe, with the release of the five prisoners from Gitmo.\nIn a Republican Party divided over tactics and policy, Jindal is trying to carve out a niche as the wonkiest candidate.\nThree things: One I think we\u2019ve made progress, but there is more work to be done.\nAnd I think that\u2019s something that we\u2019ve seen in Louisiana for a while.\nI think we\u2019ve got to replace it."}
