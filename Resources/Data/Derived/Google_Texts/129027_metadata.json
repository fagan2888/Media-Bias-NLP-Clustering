Gov. Dan Patrick said.\n\nAfter a lengthy discussion of whether they were wise with an abundance of money, senators voted 30-1 to adopt a compromise hammered out by 10 House-Senate budget negotiators last week.\n\nHouston Democratic Sen. Sylvia Garcia cast the lone vote against, as she did last month. Garcia has said the budget would spend too much on beefing up law enforcement on the Texas-Mexico border and too little on public schools. She also complained of GOP leaders\u2019 separate decision under which Texas has failed to add about 1 million adults to Medicaid, which under Obamacare would have been at least 90 percent federally funded.\n\nSenate Finance Committee Chairwoman Jane Nelson of Flower Mound received kudos from colleagues for steering the chamber\u2019s budget.\n\n\u201cThis is a responsible budget,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is a compassionate budget. And it will keep our state strong and prosperous.\u201d\n\nWhen the next two-year cycle ends in August 2017, the budget would leave $11.1 billion parked in the state\u2019s rainy day fund \u2014 not drawing down any funds, beyond the highway and water transfers approved by voters in the past two years.\n\n\u201cWe are not touching it,\u201d Nelson assured staunchly conservative Sen. Brian Birdwell, R-Granbury.\n\nOthers, though, noted that the budget also would leave $6.4 billion on the sidelines, because it spends $106.6 billion of the $113 billion of available, general-purpose state revenues. Also, Nelson noted, the budget would fall $2.9 billion under a 1979 constitutional spending limit.\n\nSen. Kevin Eltife, R-Tyler, said he\u2019s happy the budget would \u201cstop the bleeding\u201d in the Employees Retirement System for state workers and prevent retired teachers from having to pay more for their health care over the next two years. In addition, it would shell out $739 million to begin to repair deteriorating buildings, which is good, he said.\n\nLawmakers, though, should be straight with voters, he said.\n\nEltife said since he arrived in the Senate in 2004, state debt has increased to $42 billion, from $17 billion.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve doubled the state\u2019s debt over the last 10 years. That\u2019s how we have funded state government \u2013 on the credit card,\u201d he said. \u201cFor all our thumping our chests [about] no new taxes, it was done on the credit card. Finally, finally, we\u2019re admitting it\u2019s a problem.\u201d\n\nHe criticized, though, the Legislature\u2019s emerging plan this session to approve tuition revenue bonds to build and repair college and university buildings.\n\n\u201cBorrowing $3 billion for buildings when we have $15 [billion] to $18 billion makes not a lot of sense,\u201d he said.\n\nNelson replied that debt as a percentage of the state budget would be down from five years ago \u2014 though a Legislative Budget Board summary shows a slight uptick from the current cycle, from 2.71 percent 2.91 percent.\n\nTexas has a backlog of infrastructure needs, pension needs and fixes required for state-owned buildings, Nelson acknowledged.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t get here overnight. We\u2019re not going to get out of it overnight,\u201d she said. \u201cShame on us as a Legislaturee for neglecting all these problems over the years. But boy, are we making significant steps this session to try and fix them.\u201d\n\nShe stressed that the budget allows room for a separate, $3.8 billion tax-cut package. It also would increase state aid to public schools by $1.5 billion, after covering enrollment growth; increase spending on higher education by $1.1 billion; and provides about $3.7 billion more for transportation. Though that is, on a two-year basis, more than $6 billion short of what the Department of Transportation says it needs to maintain current congestion, road interests are pointing to separate legislation that would divert $2.5 billion a year of sales tax, starting in 2018, if voters approve this November.\n\nAfter Eltife\u2019s speech, several senators rushed to Nelson\u2019s defense, including Senate Finance Committee Vice Chairman Juan \u201cChuy\u201d Hinojosa, D-McAllen.\n\n\u201cRome was not built in a day,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve made much progress.\u201d\n\nSen. Charles Schwertner, a Georgetown Republican who is the Senate\u2019s chief social services budget writer, ticked off several hundred million of new expenses that the federal Affordable Care Act has created, such as a provider tax and standardized benefits in health insurance policies. An even bigger new expense he mentioned, though, is not the fault of Obamacare but of rising personal incomes in Texas: It must pick up $655 million more of the cost of Medicaid, which covers about 3 million poor Texans.\n\nSchwertner praised the budget plan as likely to stimulate the state economy even further.\n\n\u201cIt funds our priorities. It lives within our means,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it doesn\u2019t spend every dollar we have.\u201d\n\nEl Paso Democratic Sen.Jos\u00e9 Rodriguez was one of the dissenters, though he said out of respect for the institution he would support the budget.\n\n\u201cWe have the money to make up lost ground. \u2026 We could have done something,\u201d he said. \u201cThose children need the resources \u2014 now.\u201d\n\nBefore the Senate voted, the House began its debate of the conference committee\u2019s budget. If it approves the budget, as expected, it would go to Gov. Greg Abbott. Abbott has a line-item veto power, which he may use, though he is expected to approve the overall plan.", "article_metadata": {"liveFyreID": "aHR0cDovL3RyYWlsYmxhemVyc2Jsb2cuZGFsbGFzbmV3cy5jb20vMjAxNS8wNS9zZW5hdGUtb2tzLXR3by15ZWFyLTIwOS1iaWxsaW9uLXN0YXRlLWJ1ZGdldC5odG1sLw==", "generator": "WordPress 3.9.12", "author": "Robert T.
