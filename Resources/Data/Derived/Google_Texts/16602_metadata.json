Ted Cruz of Texas, Rand Paul of Kentucky and Marco Rubio of Florida\u2014sought the favor of Freedom Partners donors in a joint appearance at a private gathering early this year in Palm Springs, Calif.\n\nThe Koch-affiliated donors also are evaluating other likely GOP candidates. Among them are two current governors, Wisconsin\u2019s Scott Walker and Louisiana\u2019s Bobby Jindal, and two former governors\u2014Jeb Bush of Florida and Rick Perry of Texas. Walker appeared separately at the Palm Springs event.\n\nDonors want to see the larger GOP field tested on the campaign trail as candidates address specific policy issues and debate, the Koch aide said.\n\nAmong their considerations: how candidates see the role of the federal government and how they \u201cresonate with voters.\u201d\n\nIn an interview with USA Today published this evening, Charles Koch said the brothers and their advisers have focused on five hopefuls with a \u201cgood message\u201d and \u201cgood chance of getting elected\u201d\u2014Walker, Bush, Cruz, Paul and Rubio. He said:\n\nWhat we\u2019ve told them all is that right now, we\u2019re not supporting anyone. We\u2019re telling them that if they want our support, one way to get it is articulating a good message to help Americans get a better understanding and a better appreciation of how certain policies \u2026 will benefit them and will benefit all America.\n\nDigital outlets devoted to politics lit up Monday when The New York Times reported that David Koch appeared to say in public that Walker is the brothers\u2019 favored candidate.\n\n\u201cMy brother and I are going to take a neutral position as to who we are going to support until the primaries are over \u2026 in the summer of next year,\u201d Koch said from a podium at the Union League Club in New York, \u201cso when the primaries are over and Scott Walker gets the nomination, well \u2026\u201d\n\nLaughter and applause cut him off. After a pause, he added: \u201cThen we will support.\u201d\n\nAfter Walker spoke to a private gathering of donors at the New York club, Koch told reporters the Wisconsin governor could defeat Democratic favorite Hillary Rodham Clinton \u201cby a major margin,\u201d the Observer reported.\n\nDavid Koch later issued a \u201cclarification,\u201d which an aide provided to The Daily Signal. It reads: \u201cWhile I think Governor Walker is terrific, let me be clear I am not endorsing or supporting any candidate for president at this point in time.\u201d\n\nSome media and other observers expressed surprise that the Kochs and Freedom Partners donors would give an audience to Bush and consider backing him, since some conservatives criticize his post-governorship stands on education and immigration policies.\n\nThe Koch aide noted, however, that Bush was invited to the January meeting but could not make it because of a scheduling conflict.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The tycoon philanthropists may endorse a conservative Republican for president before the party\u2019s nominating convention, but a decision is months away.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The tycoon philanthropists may endorse a conservative Republican for president before the party\u2019s nominating convention, but a decision is months away.", "title": "Kochs Mull Nod to Conservative Before GOP Convention", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150422_Koch2016.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-04-22T12:42:11+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1Pd2NhU"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The tycoon philanthropists may endorse a conservative Republican for president before the party\u2019s nominating convention, but a decision is months away.", "title": "Kochs Mull Nod to Conservative Before GOP Convention", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150422_Koch2016.jpg"}, "creator": "@KenMac55", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Politics", "tag": "2016,cronyism", "published_time": "2015-04-21T20:59:02+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-04-22T12:42:11+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Charles Koch, David Koch, Freedom Partner, Koch Brothers endorsement, David Koch Scott Walker, Koch Brothers Scott Walker"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca39e\"", "article_summary": "The Koch aide noted, however, that Bush was invited to the January meeting but could not make it because of a scheduling conflict.\nThe brothers and their donor network simply want to reserve that option, the Koch aide told The Daily Signal.\nDonors want to see the larger GOP field tested on the campaign trail as candidates address specific policy issues and debate, the Koch aide said.\nTed Cruz of Texas, Rand Paul of Kentucky and Marco Rubio of Florida\u2014sought the favor of Freedom Partners donors in a joint appearance at a private gathering early this year in Palm Springs, Calif.\nTycoon philanthropists Charles and David Koch may endorse a conservative Republican candidate for president before the party\u2019s nominating convention, but any such decision is six months or more away."}
