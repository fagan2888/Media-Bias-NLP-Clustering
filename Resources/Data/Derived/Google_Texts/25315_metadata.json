But first, astronauts have to figure out better ways to prevent or lessen the drastic changes the human body would go through during a year-long trip hurtling through space \u2014 getting farther away from Earth at every second \u2014 with no turning back.\n\nCurrently, astronauts must go through intense training and exercise in order to prepare the body to be thrust into space. That\u2019s because the human body has internal triggers of sorts that begin to cause changes once astronauts are floating about in zero gravity \u2014 from their blood flow to their skeletal frames.\n\nBones\n\n\u201cThe human body is uniquely designed to live in Earth\u2019s gravity,\u201d the National Space Biomedical Research Institute writes. \u201cIn space, the body begins to adapt to the microgravity environment.\u201d\n\nThe body adapts to different environments on Earth, so why would it be any different in space? One of the biggest changes occurs in the skeletal system. Astronauts who are in space for over a month can lose a significant amount of bone mass. This is because the skeleton is no longer needed to hold up our weight; in zero gravity, you float everywhere. This reduction in bearing weight leads to the breakdown of bones and the reabsorption of calcium in the body, which weakens bone mass. According to the National Space Biomedical Research Institute, a postmenopausal woman with osteoporosis can lose up to 1 to 1.5 percent of bone mass per year, but an astronaut can lose that much in just one month.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know what sensors in your body recognize that you\u2019re weightless, or why we would even have those sensors,\u201d Chris Hadfield, a retired Canadian astronaut who was the first Canadian to walk in space, told Joe Rogan during a radio interview. \u201cBut your body starts to shed your skeleton right away.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, humans get a little bit taller in space. On Earth, discs between the vertebrae of the spinal column are somewhat compressed due to gravity \u2014 but in space, the discs expand, making the spine longer.\n\nMuscles\n\nAs many of you who sit at a desk all day may know quite well, you lose your muscles if you don\u2019t use them. People floating about in space have far less resistance to air, gravity, and various other environmental features like wind. Without walking, running, going upstairs, or even simply holding up your posture under the weight of gravity, your muscle mass would gradually begin decreasing just like your bones. This is why preceding a lengthy space excursion, astronauts are required to undergo some serious exercise training to build up their muscles. There are some in-space exercises that astronauts can work on too, but researchers are still developing good interventions to prevent muscle loss \u2014 such as nutritional supplements.\n\nHeart & Blood Circulation\n\nGravity actually helps to distribute blood through our bodies, so when it\u2019s no longer present, fluids begin to travel toward the upper parts of the body and head. This can lead to a feeling of congestion. And the heart does not have to work as hard in the microgravity environment, so this could gradually lead to a smaller heart.\n\nRecovery after returning to Earth is a whole other road to travel down. \u201c[W]hen you come home, it\u2019s brutal building those things back up again,\u201d Hadfield notes. It takes one year for your body to fully recover, he says, and it personally took him up to 4 months to be able to run again properly. \u201cMy body got osteoporosis, and it\u2019s reversing osteoporosis using some internal stimulus that we don\u2019t even understand,\u201d he said during the radio interview. \u201cSo it makes a pretty good medical study for everybody.\u201d\n\nTo view what happens to the body in space in more detail, check out NASA\u2019s interactive piece here.\n\nPsychological\n\nLeaving Earth behind and knowing you\u2019re one of the few humans in space can have quite the impact on your psyche. Astronauts experience a mix of fear, excitement, fascination, and anxiety as well as feelings of isolation or loneliness.\n\nSome studies have been completed on long expeditions in Antarctica, since space travelers will have to cohabit with one another in a very small space for up to three years if on a Mars mission. Researchers discovered a surge of depression around the halfway point of these Antarctica trips, once crew members realized how much longer it would take to get back. In short, astronauts must be a very specific type of person \u2014 one who has an \u201celevated capacity to regulate stress, temporarily displace emotions, and filter out preoccupying thoughts\u201d as well as be \u201chighly resilient to environmental source of psychological distress including isolation, interrupted sleep cycles, the hyperarousal caused by excitement, intense work schedules, and the absence of day and night in space.\u201d\n\nHadfield says there will most likely be a different type of profound impact on the psyches of the astronauts who will be the first to go to Mars \u2014 a sense of disconnection from all that is familiar:\n\nIt\u2019s not so bad in the space station because we\u2019re so close to the world. But as soon as you start going to Mars, within a couple weeks, you will never have another normal conversation with Earth. \u2026Everything has so much lag that you\u2019ll just have recorded video messages back and forth. So the [psychological] impact of that is going to be high. And the Earth will shrink to just another star in a couple weeks. \u2026 Those people will become Martians. \u2026 They will no longer be from Earth. \u2026 When I was on the space station the second time, one of the other crew members \u2026 in passing, a throwaway thing she didn\u2019t even think she was saying, she said: \u2018Hey you know, Earth said that we\u2019re supposed to do this next.\u2019 In my mind I heard, \u2018Earth said.\u2019 I heard those words come out of her mouth, and it was like, she has in her mind completely split off from the other seven billion people. There\u2019s her crew, and Earth is one singular identifiable entity on the other side. And that was a real bell-ringer to me of what it\u2019s going to be like to go to Mars. Those people are going to be a completely discreet unit of people and they\u2019ll be Martians, they won\u2019t be earthlings in their heads. How do we deal with that? How do we plan for that?\n\nReturning to Earth after extended periods of time in space can lead to vast psychological and physical changes. Some astronauts who have returned after a life-changing experience in space have a better perspective on things, noting that they ultimately cared less about petty political battles, or personal self-centered thoughts. Instead, some focused more on helping others. As rocket pioneer Krafft A. Ehricke said, \"Man's mind and spirit grow with the space in which they are allowed to operate.\"", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "what happens to your body in space, astronauts health", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Your body experiences gradual changes \u2014 from a shrinking skeleton to calluses on the top of your feet \u2014 if you spend a long time in space.", "title": "This Is What Happens To Your Body And Mind In Space", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/out-world-what-happens-your-body-and-mind-when-youre-floating-around-space-301062", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/09/03/astronaut.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Your body experiences gradual changes \u2014 from a shrinking skeleton to calluses on the top of your feet \u2014 if you spend a long time in space.", "title": "This Is What Happens To Your Body And Mind In Space", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/out-world-what-happens-your-body-and-mind-when-youre-floating-around-space-301062", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/09/03/astronaut.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/09/03/astronaut.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Science/Tech", "published_time": "2014-09-03T16:44:55-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-09-04T13:59:54-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Your body experiences gradual changes \u2014 from a shrinking skeleton to calluses on the top of your feet \u2014 if you spend a long time in space."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb0fd\"", "article_summary": "\u201cIn space, the body begins to adapt to the microgravity environment.\u201dThe body adapts to different environments on Earth, so why would it be any different in space?\nBones\u201cThe human body is uniquely designed to live in Earth\u2019s gravity,\u201d the National Space Biomedical Research Institute writes.\nCurrently, astronauts must go through intense training and exercise in order to prepare the body to be thrust into space.\n\u201cSo it makes a pretty good medical study for everybody.\u201dTo view what happens to the body in space in more detail, check out NASA\u2019s interactive piece here.\n\u201cBut your body starts to shed your skeleton right away.\u201dAt the same time, humans get a little bit taller in space."}
