The student, Alex Stone, was assigned by a teacher to write a story about himself. Stone chose to embellish his story with obviously fictional details, like dinosaurs. But the teacher saw the word \"gun\" and the rest is history, according to NBC-12:\n\nStone said in his \"status\" he wrote a fictional story that involved the words \"gun\" and \"take care of business.\" \"I killed my neighbor's pet dinosaur, and, then, in the next status I said I bought the gun to take care of the business,\" Stone said. Stone says his statements were taken completely out of context. \"I could understand if they made him re-write it because he did have \"gun\" in it. But a pet dinosaur?\" said Alex's mother Karen Gray.\"I mean first of all, we don't have dinosaurs anymore. Second of all, he's not even old enough to buy a gun.\" Investigators say the teacher contacted school officials after seeing the message containing the words \"gun\" and \"take care of business,\" and police were then notified on Tuesday.\n\nThe police arrested Stone and charged him with disorderly conduct. He was also suspended from school for a week.\n\nAnd just like that, the pop-tart gun suspension has been dethroned as the most absurd zero tolerance story. And it's not even September yet! Well done, Summerville.\n\nReaders, welcome back to public school.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "The kid was charged with disorderly conduct.", "title": "Teen Arrested, Suspended for Shooting a Dinosaur (In a Story He Wrote)", "url": "http://reason.com/blog/2014/08/20/teen-arrested-suspended-for-shooting-a-d", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14085606193075.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Now that summer is over and school is starting up\nagain, it's time for the torrent of ridiculous \"zero tolerance\"\nsuspensions and arrests to resume.\nSummerville High School in Summerville, South Carolina, is\nwasting no time: A 16-year-old student was arrested and\nsuspended for writing a story in which he used a gun to\nkill a dinosaur.
