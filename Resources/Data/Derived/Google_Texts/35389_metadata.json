The utility has expressed interest in participating in a one megawatt, or larger, solar energy project at Mitchell, the consultant says in the report. One megawatt of power is equal to the electrical demand of 150 homes in Wisconsin.\n\nWe Energies is studying the possible installation of a solar array at the airport capable of generating two megawatts of power, a spokeswoman said Friday. The project might be included in the utility's next rate request to the state Public Service Commission.\n\nSupervisor Marina Dimitrijevic proposed the publicly owned 5-acre solar farm as one way to reduce Mitchell's utility costs and make the airport energy self-sufficient. The consultant was selected for the feasibility study because it helped the Federal Aviation Administration write its guidebook on solar energy developments at airports.\n\nIn May, the consultant concluded there were a dozen open spaces large enough for a broad array of sun-tracking panels that would not interfere with aviation or traffic control.\n\nThe four best locations and project designs identified in the latest report are: solar panels at employee parking lots north and west of the terminal, an array of solar panels on land south of the main airport entrance, a solar array on land north of the main airport entrance, and solar panels on top of the existing main parking garage.\n\nBut this is as far as county staff and the consultant will carry the study unless the County Board authorizes further analysis of one or more of the options, said Stevan Keith, leader of environmental services in the Milwaukee County Department of Administrative Services.\n\nDimitrijevic said she would ask the board in October to engage the consultant for one more step down the path toward a solar farm at Mitchell.\n\nMilwaukee County has installed solar panels on six buildings, including an admissions booth at the zoo and a wall at the Milwaukee Public Museum.", "article_metadata": {"title": "Consultant says solar farm at Mitchell Airport wouldn't pay off", "og": {"url": "http://www.jsonline.com/news/milwaukee/consultant-says-solar-farm-at-mitchell-airport-wouldnt-pay-off-b99574980z1-327198491.html", "image": {"width": 200, "identifier": "http://media.jrn.com/images/js-for-social-200-final.jpg", "height": 200}, "type": "article", "description": "The cost of building an array of solar panels at the airport to generate one megawatt of power is estimated at $6 million and could take as long as 75 years to pay back, the report says.", "title": "Consultant says solar farm at Mitchell wouldn\u2019t pay off"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.jrn.com/images/js-for-social-200-final.jpg", "description": "The cost of building an array of solar panels at the airport to generate one megawatt of power is estimated at $6 million and could take as long as 75 years to pay back, the report says.", "site": "@journalsentinel", "card": "summary", "title": "Consultant says solar farm at Mitchell Airport wouldn't pay off"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "fb": {"admins": "journal.sentinel.1", "app_id": 227386193957280}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://media.jrn.com/designimages/logo-mjs-144-icon.png", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda8c3\"", "article_summary": "By of theConstruction of a proposed 5-acre solar energy farm at Mitchell International Airport would not be a good investment for the county or the airport, a consultant concludes in a report to the Milwaukee County Board.\nThe utility has expressed interest in participating in a one megawatt, or larger, solar energy project at Mitchell, the consultant says in the report.\nSupervisor Marina Dimitrijevic proposed the publicly owned 5-acre solar farm as one way to reduce Mitchell's utility costs and make the airport energy self-sufficient.\nThe consultant was selected for the feasibility study because it helped the Federal Aviation Administration write its guidebook on solar energy developments at airports.\nMilwaukee County has installed solar panels on six buildings, including an admissions booth at the zoo and a wall at the Milwaukee Public Museum."}
