The department also plans to do a follow-up survey in six months to ensure that the companies are complying with the Knox Keene Act, which regulates health care plans in California.\n\nSince January, when the new plans under the nation's health care law took effect, widespread consumer outrage over the inaccurate lists led to dozens of Blue Cross and Blue Shield customers filing complaints with the state.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnthony Wright, executive director of Health Access California, a consumer advocacy group, said in a statement: \"The results of the investigation are deeply troubling. If significant numbers of doctors listed aren't where the insurers say they are, that's a big violation of trust to premium-paying patients.\"\n\nThe report comes as 1.1 million Californians who enrolled in health plans since last fall under the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, have three months to re-enroll -- either in the same plan or a different one.\n\nOfficials at Covered California are hoping another 500,000 additional people will sign up for a private insurance plan by the Feb. 15 enrollment deadline.\n\nSpokesmen for both Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield on Tuesday released statements saying that their companies acknowledged there were problems with the directories. But both said that they have taken significant steps to improve their accuracy.\n\nBut according to the new report, both companies told department officials that the survey's methodology was flawed.\n\nSteven Weissberg, a 52-year-old self-employed technologist from Benicia, said he expects the insurers' directories will continue to have problems.\n\nHe said the Anthem Blue Cross plan he signed up for through Covered California in August listed four of his doctors. But when he called their offices, he was told they would not accept his plan.\n\n\"It's a poison pill -- they are forcing you into out-of-network coverage,\" said Weissberg, who is now considering joining a Kaiser Permanente HMO instead.\n\nContact Tracy Seipel at 408-920-5343.
