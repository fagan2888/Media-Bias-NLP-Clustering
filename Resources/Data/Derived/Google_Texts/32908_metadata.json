The Post's Karen Tumulty takes a look at some of the states' most controversial ads selling Obamacare. (Julie Percha/The Washington Post)\n\nYoung adults account for slightly less than one-fourth of the Americans who signed up for health plans during the initial three months of federal and state insurance marketplaces \u2014 fewer so far than the government has said will be needed to make the economics of the new exchanges work.\n\nThe figures, part of a monthly progress report on the marketplaces that was issued Monday, offer the first glimpse into whether the health plans available under the Affordable Care Act are becoming provinces of the old and sick or are managing to attract young, healthy people who have not previously considered insurance worthwhile.\n\nAccording to the report, released by Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, 24 percent of the nearly 2.2 million people who enrolled in the marketplaces through the end of December are between the ages of 18 and 34. One-third are 55 to 64 years old.\n\nThe figures mean that the proportion of young adults is lagging behind what both government and outside health policy analysts have said will be required for the exchanges to remain stable. Analyses have concluded that, to prevent health plans\u2019 premiums from rising and some insurers from potentially dropping out, roughly two in five Americans in the plans should be young adults.\n\nIn releasing the report, Obama administration officials were upbeat. The latest enrollment figures are \u201csolid, solid news for us,\u201d a senior administration official told reporters at a White House briefing. The officials predicted that the health plans would attract more young adults during the second half of the open-enrollment period for this year, which continues through March.\n\nView Graphic ACA enrollment numbers, state-by-state\n\nStill, the report\u2019s numbers increase the significance of outreach efforts designed to persuade young people to sign up. Whether sufficient numbers of young people will do so, despite the law\u2019s requirement that most Americans have coverage or face a financial penalty, has been an uncertainty hovering over the law.\n\nAdministration officials said Monday that their plans to intensify promotional efforts aimed at young adults will focus on two dozen communities in states such as Texas that rely on the federal marketplace and have especially large uninsured populations.\n\nHealth policy specialists and industry officials said it is too early to know whether the enrollment patterns will shift in the next few months, although Republicans wielded the new figures as their latest weapon to condemn the federal health-care law.\n\n\u201cYouth enrollment has been a bust so far,\u201d said Brendan Buck, spokesman for House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio).\n\nLarry Levitt, senior vice president at the Kaiser Family Foundation, said the proportion of young people \u201cis lower than would be ideal.\u201d Still, he said, the data were \u201cencouraging,\u201d given that people have another 21 / 2 months to enroll and that the federal online system, HealthCare.gov, had defects that prevented many people from signing up for much of the fall.\n\nIn a study last month, the foundation concluded that 40 percent of the people who could benefit from the new insurance marketplaces are 18 to 34 years old \u2014 and therefore, the pool of people who join the plans should match that proportion. The study also predicted that if the proportion of young people remains roughly as low as it is now, it could reduce health plans\u2019 income from premiums in ways that, while not huge, could nevertheless cut their typical profits roughly by half.\n\nRobert Zirkelbach, spokesman for America\u2019s Health Insurance Plans, the industry\u2019s main trade group, said the impact of who buys coverage \u201cis more a continuum than a cliff\u201d and pointed out that insurance prices are influenced by both the age of customers and how much health care they need. \u201cThe more young, healthy people participating, the more stable the marketplace will be, and the more affordable coverage will be,\u201d he said.\n\nThe enrollment report said that, in the three dozen states relying on the federal marketplace, 23 percent of the nearly 1.2 million people who enrolled by late December are ages 18 to 34. In 14 states, plus the District of Columbia, that are running their own new marketplaces, 25 percent of the nearly 900,000 people who enrolled fall within that age group.\n\nYoung adults accounted for 44 percent of the people who signed up for health plans in the District, the highest percentage in the country. In both Maryland and Virginia, the share of 18-to-34-year-olds was 27 percent.\n\nThe overall enrollment of nearly 2.2 million in Monday\u2019s report, from the marketplaces\u2019 start on Oct. 1 through Dec. 28, echoes information the White House previously issued. The data show a seven-fold upswing in enrollment in the federal exchange from the first two months as the Web site\u2019s \u00adperformance improved. Federal health officials said, however, that they do not yet know how many of those people were uninsured before \u2014 or how many of those who enrolled have paid their first month\u2019s premium in order for their coverage to start.\n\nWhile Americans can sign up through March 31 for coverage in 2014, the December enrollment period was especially significant because the health plans took effect on New Year\u2019s Day and anyone who signed up by Dec. 24 \u2014 and pays the first premium by various deadlines this month \u2014 is covered from the beginning.\n\nBeyond the age breakdowns, the report issued Monday contained the first information on the sex of people buying new health plans, showing that 53 percent are women and 47 percent are men.\n\nThe report also showed that, of four tiers of coverage, named for different metals, by far the most popular are the \u201csilver\u201d plans \u2014 the second level from the bottom \u2014 which outside health analysts have found have a typical insurance deductible of $2,500, far more than traditional health coverage.\n\nUnder the law, the government is for the first time providing subsidies to help Americans pay for private health insurance. During the first three months of enrollment, the report said, about four in five people who signed up qualified for a federal tax credit.", "article_metadata": {"description": "More 18 to 34 year olds needed to buy insurance to keep premiums in check", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/pages/Sandhya-Somashekhar/424900341023463", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "More 18 to 34 year olds needed to buy insurance to keep premiums in check", "title": "Health-insurance sign-ups by young adults lag behind pace seen as key to new law\u2019s success", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/young-adults-make-up-almost-one-quarter-of-aca-signups/2014/01/13/ed5846d0-7c73-11e3-93c1-0e888170b723_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w//2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2013/10/16/National-Politics/Graphics/aca-enrollment-promo-296.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@sandhyawp"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/young-adults-make-up-almost-one-quarter-of-aca-signups/2014/01/13/ed5846d0-7c73-11e3-93c1-0e888170b723_story.html", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "health", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/pages/Sandhya-Somashekhar/424900341023463"}, "eomportal-uuid": "ed5846d0-7c73-11e3-93c1-0e888170b723", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "health"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda525\"", "article_summary": "Under the law, the government is for the first time providing subsidies to help Americans pay for private health insurance.\nYoung adults accounted for 44 percent of the people who signed up for health plans in the District, the highest percentage in the country.\nThe officials predicted that the health plans would attract more young adults during the second half of the open-enrollment period for this year, which continues through March.\nAnalyses have concluded that, to prevent health plans\u2019 premiums from rising and some insurers from potentially dropping out, roughly two in five Americans in the plans should be young adults.\n(Julie Percha/The Washington Post)The economic success of the Affordable Care Act depends on young, healthy people to enroll."}
