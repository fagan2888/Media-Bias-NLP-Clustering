Waterford — A torn knee ligament wasn't about to slow down Burlington Co-op gymnast Bailey Fitzpatrick.

The senior, who won the WIAA Division 1 state all-around championship as a freshman and sophomore, was poised to win her third in a row but injured her left knee competing on the vault at the sectional meet last February.

Since then, Fitzpatrick has done almost nothing except train herself back into shape.

"She put in a ton of work in the off-season," said Burlington coach Diane Biedrzycki. "She has come back strong."

Fitzpatrick's comeback took a big step forward Saturday when she won two events, finished second in another and took home the all-around championship at the 15th annual Pam Beck Emerald Classic.

At the eight-team meet, Fitzpatrick won the uneven bars with an impressive 9.7 and the vault with a 9.65. She placed second in the floor exercise (9.325) and won the all-around (37.25).

"The knee is doing well," said Fitzpatrick, who recently decided to compete in gymnastics at UW-Whitewater next season. "I took some time off, but I wanted to get back to it as soon as I could. I have been working to get back to where I was."

Her all-around would have been even more outstanding had she not fallen off the balance beam twice and finished with an 8.575.

"It was just one of those days," Fitzpatrick said of her beam routine. "But I would rather have that now than in a meet later when stuff gets more important."

Said Biedrzycki: "It was almost comical to see. You never see Bailey make those kinds of mistakes on the beam."

Fellow senior Molly Benavides hardly made any mistakes on the beam and won the event with a meet-high 9.75. She also won the floor exercise (9.35) and was second on the uneven bars (9.45).

The Demons duo helped Burlington win the team title with a 140.800. Defending state champion Franklin Combined finished second with 138.475, while Kenosha Combined was third (138.40). Waukesha Combined was fourth (134.125) and West Allis Central/Hale seventh (121.90).

Burlington, which has finished second at the Division 1 state meet the last four seasons, squared off against Franklin on Tuesday in a dual meet, which the Sabers won.

"Today I think we cleaned up some things that we didn't really do well on Tuesday," Biedrzycki said. "Everything was a little bit cleaner. I felt like we had a really good team meet."

Along with Fitzpatrick, Benavides was really good on her three events. She competed only on the beam Tuesday against Franklin as Burlington coaches are pacing the senior, who has won nine state medals.

"We are easing her into everything," Biedrzycki said. "Today should be a huge confidence boost for her."

Franklin, which has won four straight state team championships, did not have any gymnasts compete in all four events Saturday. Senior Erin Scholz finished second on the beam (9.45), third on floor (9.125) and fourth on bars (8.95). Junior Sam Balcerak placed third on bars (9.4) and fifth on beam (9.2).

Kenosha got a strong meet from junior Mady Marko, who finished second in the all-around (36.475) by placing second on vault (9.45), third on beam (9.325) and fourth on floor (9.1). Senior Hope Landre was fifth in the all-around (33.775) and on floor (9.05).

Waukesha had two gymnasts in the all-around top six: Liza Klahr, who was fourth (33.90), and Sydney Stuart, who was sixth (33.575). For host Waterford, which finished fifth, Sam Dziak was third on vault (9.025) and Isabel Saber was sixth on floor (9.0).
