By reimbursing each state for 100% of the cost of the newly-eligible for the first three years after it expands Medicaid eligibility, regardless of when it closes the gap, the proposal will further increase the fiscal savings Missouri would see by expanding Medicaid.\n\nMissouri has approximately 300,000 people in the coverage gap, meaning they make too much money to qualify for Medicaid, yet not enough for subsidies under the Affordable Care Act. \u201cClosing the coverage gap would already be a fiscal win for Missouri. But this added incentive, if approved by Congress, is just one more reason the Missouri Legislature should act today to expand Medicaid,\u201d said Amy Blouin, Executive Director of the Missouri Budget Project. States that have already expanded Medicaid are saving state funds by moving people that are currently eligible for state-funded programs to the federally funded expansion. As they draw down billions of federal dollars to help cover the uninsured and provide health security to working families, they reduce their own spending, resulting in net fiscal gains. Missouri is already expected to save at least $100 million annually when Medicaid expansion is fully implemented. This added financial boost will increase those net savings in the initial years.\n\nBeyond the fiscal benefits to the state, closing the coverage gap will allow people to remain in their jobs or get back to work. \u201cIt is high time that the Missouri Legislature put politics aside and focus on a policy that not only will bring new revenue into the state, but also provide needed healthcare for 300,000 hard-working Missourians,\u201d said Jen Bersdale, Executive Director of Missouri Health Care for All. It will help Christopher, a 36-year old husband and father in St. Louis who has no health insurance even though both he and his wife work. Because he is uninsured, Christopher is unable to be screened for the hereditary heart condition that killed his father at age 40. It will also help Karen, a 64-year old grandmother in Jasper County. When Karen retired recently in order to care for her granddaughter, she lost her health insurance, and now she is unable to see a doctor to ensure that her high blood pressure stays under control. Missouri\u2019s current Medicaid eligibility is among the lowest in the nation, preventing most working adults from accessing essential care.\n\nPeople who are trying to work and trying to meet their health insurance requirements are caught in a political game being played by the Missouri Legislature. \u201cIt\u2019s time this legislature took full advantage of the federal governments offerings in reducing the cost of health care in Missouri and in meeting the needs of the Missouri citizens caught in this gap,\u201d said Kathy Birkes, Interim Executive Director of the Missouri Health Advocacy Alliance.\n\nWhile state projections have shown that state savings will already outweigh the state\u2019s costs, the President\u2019s proposal will save the state even more. Michelle Trupiano, Director of the Missouri Medicaid Coalition states, \u201cThere is absolutely no reason for the legislature not to act this year to close the coverage gap. Our budget benefits while also drastically improving the lives of 300,000 Missourians.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Missouri Times", "description": "January 14, 2016 Press Contacts: Missouri Budget Project \u2013 Traci Gleason \u2013 816-872-8133 Missouri Health Advocacy Alliance \u2013 Brian Colby \u2013 573-634-9800 Missouri Health Care for All \u2013 Jen Bersdale \u2013 314-651-6568 Missouri Medicaid Coalition \u2013 Michelle Trupiano \u2013 314-805-5429 For Immediate Release: New Incentive to Close the Coverage Gap Creates Opportunity for Missouri Today,...", "title": "PR New Incentive to Close the Coverage Gap Creates Opportunity for Missouri", "locale": "en_US", "url": "http://themissouritimes.com/26149/pr-new-incentive-to-close-the-coverage-gap-creates-opportunity-for-missouri/", "type": "article"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/mo.times.14", "section": "Press Release - Government", "published_time": "2016-01-14T17:25:53-05:00"}, "generator": "Seriously Simple Podcasting 1.14.3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "Michelle Trupiano, Director of the Missouri Medicaid Coalition states, \u201cThere is absolutely no reason for the legislature not to act this year to close the coverage gap.\n\u201cClosing the coverage gap would already be a fiscal win for Missouri.\nBeyond the fiscal benefits to the state, closing the coverage gap will allow people to remain in their jobs or get back to work.\nMissouri has approximately 300,000 people in the coverage gap, meaning they make too much money to qualify for Medicaid, yet not enough for subsidies under the Affordable Care Act.\nBut this added incentive, if approved by Congress, is just one more reason the Missouri Legislature should act today to expand Medicaid,\u201d said Amy Blouin, Executive Director of the Missouri Budget Project."}
