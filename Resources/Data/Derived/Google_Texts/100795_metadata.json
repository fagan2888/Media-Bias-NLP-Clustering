Some developers have found ways of getting compensation for their work via crowdfunding on Kickstarter or on BountySource.com, a platform specifically for funding open-source software development.\n\nMr. Johnston believes that Bitcoin may be another and, possibly, better way of sponsoring open-source development. \u201cIt\u2019s a new way to monetize open-source,\u201d he said.\n\nBitAngels have already invested the Bitcoin equivalent of $5 million into MSC Protocol, an open-source platform that runs the Mastercoin.org website. In this case, Mr. Johnston said, 50 members of the BitAngels network used Bitcoin to buy digital tokens called mastercoin. The bitcoins that were received are now used to entice programmers to develop new features built on MSC Protocol.\n\nCurrently, the main feature is a digital-currency exchange, Mr. Johnston said. Down the line, there may be other uses for MSC Protocol, such as enabling people to virtually hand over digital documents like deeds and titles to one\u2019s car or house.\n\nThe idea, Mr. Johnston said, is that as the Mastercoin platform gets developed and provides new features, the value of mastercoin\u2013the digital tokens that the platform uses to conduct transactions\u2013increases, and the original investors can get a return on their investment.\n\nThe Mastercoin protocol doesn\u2019t just use Bitcoin as an incentive, it also uses the Bitcoin network to verify transactions. It\u2019s an application built on top of the Bitcoin layer, said Mr. Johnston, in a way that mobile apps are built on top of an Android platform. \u201cThe layers that are developing are similar to layers in technology today,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Johnston said he expects his group to back 20 more open-source software projects this year that rely on Bitcoin. Another project Mr. Johnston is evaluating uses digital tokens bought with bitcoins to reward people who provide storage space for shared digital files. The goal would be to compete with other cloud-storage services, like Dropbox, by crowd-sourcing storage space.\n\nThis wave of projects may end up competing with incorporated companies, many backed by venture capitalists, that are building a business around Bitcoin, such as bitcoin-to-dollar exchanges.\n\nWrite to Yuliya Chernova at yuliya.chernova@wsj.com.
