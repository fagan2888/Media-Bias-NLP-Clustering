Nuggets forward Darrell Arthur and guard Nate Robinson have exercised their contract options for the 2014-15 season, Nuggets general manager Tim Connelly announced Monday morning.

Arthur, acquired in a draft-night trade on June 27 last year, averaged 5.9 points and 3.1 rebounds in 68 games with Denver last season. He also made a career-high 24 3-pointers â€” 19 more than his previous four seasons combined.

In 315 career games with Denver and Memphis, Arthur is averaging 6.5 points and 3.7 rebounds.

Robinson, signed as a free agent last July 26, averaged 10.4 points and 2.5 assists in 44 games with Denver before suffering a season-ending knee injury on Jan. 29.

Preparing to enter his 10th NBA season, Robinson has averaged 11.4 points, 3.0 assists and 2.4 rebounds in 574 games with Denver, Chicago, Golden State, Oklahoma City, Boston and New York.
