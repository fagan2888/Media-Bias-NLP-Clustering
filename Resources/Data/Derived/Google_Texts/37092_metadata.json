Bush\u2019s White House, the firm was taking in almost $18 million in lobbying fees. That ranked QGA at No. 9 among K Street\u2019s top earners that year, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.\n\nThe co-founder of what is now QGA Public Affairs, Jack Quinn, praised Gillespie, but said he won\u2019t be supporting his Senate bid.\n\n\u201cI remain a loyal Democrat, and I conduct my political activities accordingly,\u201d Quinn said in a statement to The Hill.\n\n\u201cWe owe much to the keen judgment and superlative communications skills that Ed brought in starting the firm 14 years ago,\u201d Quinn said. \u201cAt the same time, the strong reputation and loyal client base that we have today were substantially built on the years of effective and bipartisan strategic counsel provided by the terrific team that makes up QGA today.\u201d\n\nWith their Senate majority at risk, Democrats hope Gillespie\u2019s influence industry success will be unpalatable to Virginia voters \u2014 even though one of the party\u2019s own, Terry McAuliffe, overcame similar attacks to win the state\u2019s governor\u2019s race last year.\n\n\u201cThe contrast is clear as day. Sen. Warner has worked tirelessly to reach across the aisle to grow the economy and get the nation\u2019s fiscal house in order while Ed Gillespie has spent years shilling for special interests and supporting failed policies that tanked the economy,\u201d said Adams, with the DNC.\n\nThey also hope to use the lobbyist smear to take down David Jolly, who is running for the House seat of his former boss, the late Rep. Bill Young (R-Fla.). Jolly founded lobby shop Three Bridges Advisors Inc., and also has lobbied for K Street giant Van Scoyoc Associates.\n\nK Street lobbyists are accustomed to being a punch line during election season, and they dismiss the rhetoric as election-year posturing.\n\nA former colleague of Gillespie\u2019s at QGA said both parties know their way around K Street.\n\n\u201cThe Democratic attack on lobbyists is now as stale as it is hypocritical,\u201d said Jeff Connaughton, who left the firm in 2009 to join then-Sen. Ted Kaufman\u2019s (D-Del.) staff.\n\n\u201cSenators of both parties are constantly attending fundraising events at every lobbying firm in town, taking PAC checks from every corporate client in town.\u201d\n\nThe \u201clobbyist\u201d attack can be effective because the public does not hold the profession in high regard. A Gallup poll released last month found only 6 percent of people polled say lobbyists have \u201chigh\u201d or \u201cvery high\u201d ethical standards \u2014 the lowest out of the 22 professions respondents were asked about.\n\nThat creates a political problem for lobbyists-turned-candidates, who typically have to disclose their clients when running for office.\n\n\u201cThe law requires candidates who are working for firms, that they identify clients that they provide direct services to,\u201d said Kenneth Gross, who leads the political law practice at Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom. \u201cThis includes law firms and lobby firms and possibly PR firms. ... There is a compensation threshold of $5,000 and confidential information does not have to be disclosed.\u201d\n\nWhen Gillespie entered the White House as a counselor to Bush, he filed a financial disclosure form listing dozens of QGA clients, including Amgen, Bank of America, Microsoft, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and Visa.\n\nBut he has never registered to lobby at his new firm, Ed Gillespie Strategies, nor has he ever disclosed his clients.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not required to disclose my clients. If, however, I do decide to run, I will seek their permission to allow me to do so, even before any disclosure forms are required to be submitted,\u201d Gillespie said.\n\nDemocrats have worked to attach the \u201cScarlet L\u201d to other GOP candidates in recent elections, and with mixed success.\n\nTommy Thompson lost his 2012 Senate race against Sen. Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.) after being assailed by Democrats for his work at influence powerhouse Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld.\n\nBut the lobbyist attack didn\u2019t stick to Sen. Dan Coats (R-Ind.), who won his 2010 Senate race despite attempts to demonize his lobbying at the firm King & Spalding.\n\n\u201cHe was registered for this company and that company. It came to us on what did he do, the extent that he lobbied, and the answer was not very much. And that was the end of it,\u201d said Tom Spulak, chairman of King & Spalding\u2019s government advocacy and public policy practice group.\n\nAsked if the political scrutiny damaged the firm\u2019s image, Spulak said no.\n\n\u201cAnd I don\u2019t think it damaged [Coats] either,\u201d he said.\n\nJessica Taylor and Cameron Joseph contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Democrats are aiming to wrap him in the \u201cScarlet L\u201d of a Washington lobbyist.", "description": "Democrats are aiming to wrap him in the \u201cScarlet L\u201d of a Washington lobbyist.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Kevin Bogardus", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "Democrats are aiming to wrap him in the \u201cScarlet L\u201d of a Washington lobbyist.", "title": "Gillespie Senate run tests stigma of \u2018lobbyist\u2019 label", "url": "http://thehill.com/business-a-lobbying/business-a-lobbying/195320-gillespie-senate-run-tests-stigma-of-lobbyist-label", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/article_images/gillespieed_110309getty.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-01-14T14:45:53-05:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/business-a-lobbying/business-a-lobbying/195320-gillespie-senate-run-tests-stigma-of-lobbyist-label", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "Democrats are aiming to wrap him in the \u201cScarlet L\u201d of a Washington lobbyist.", "card": "summary", "title": "Gillespie Senate run tests stigma of \u2018lobbyist\u2019 label"}, "dcterms.modified": "2014-01-14T14:45-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/business-a-lobbying/business-a-lobbying/195320-gillespie-senate-run-tests-stigma-of-lobbyist-label", "dcterms.date": "2014-01-14T06:00-05:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Kevin Bogardus", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Ed Gillespie, Jack Quinn, Quinn Gillespie & Associates, Government, Lobbying, Politics,Ed Gillespie, Jack Quinn,", "article": {"published_time": "2014-01-14T06:00:00-05:00", "modified_time": "2014-01-14T14:45:53-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "dcterms.title": "Gillespie Senate run tests stigma of \u2018lobbyist\u2019 label"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdab60\"", "article_summary": "Democrats are aiming to hobble the Senate candidacy of Ed Gillespie by wrapping him in the \u201cScarlet L\u201d of a Washington lobbyist.\n\u201cFor the past five years, clients have valued my strategic communications advice as founder of Ed Gillespie Strategies,\u201d he said.\nBut he has never registered to lobby at his new firm, Ed Gillespie Strategies, nor has he ever disclosed his clients.\nThe co-founder of what is now QGA Public Affairs, Jack Quinn, praised Gillespie, but said he won\u2019t be supporting his Senate bid.\nGillespie helped found QGA in 2000, and cemented his status as a power broker by serving as chairman of the Republican National Committee."}
