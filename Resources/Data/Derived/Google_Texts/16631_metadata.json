It\u2019s a daily reminder of where he comes from: Waco, Texas. His home town is the birthplace of the beverage that he always seems to have in hand.\n\nBarton\u2019s allegiance to products of the Lone Star State extends to his work on the House Energy and Commerce Committee, where he\u2019s been an advocate of the oil and gas industry for nearly three decades. That culminated in a repeal of the crude-oil export ban last December. Fresh from that win, the panel\u2019s \u201cchairman emeritus\u201d is now positioning himself to once again lead the committee he\u2019s served on since 1987.\n\nAn engineer whose district extends across a swath of reliably Republican suburbs south of Dallas, Barton wants more drilling on public lands and pushed hard for the Keystone pipeline. He sparked an uproar (and a rebuke from GOP leadership) for apologizing to a BP executive for the \u201cshakedown\u201d the company got from President Barack Obama after the Gulf oil spill.\n\nBarton, whose gentle, lilting speaking style belies a steely demeanor, sat down with Bloomberg Government to chat about why he wants to return as chairman of the Energy and Commerce committee, how he was treated by GOP leaders last time he ran for chairman and which jersey he plans to wear at this year\u2019s congressional baseball game.\n\nI understand you want to be chairman again.\n\nIt\u2019s legally possible. I\u2019d say I\u2019m a little bit of a long-shot, a dark horse.\n\nWhy do you say that?\n\nWell, you\u2019ve got three or four people that have never been a committee chairman \u2014John Shimkus and Greg Walden would probably be the top two. And Congresswoman (Marsha) Blackburn of Tennessee.\n\nBased on the ability to get things done, I\u2019d be the leading contender. If you want to have an activist committee in the next Congress, I would be a committee chairman that could make things happen. But I certainly understand there are other people who are qualified, and I\u2019m not being negative on them at all. So we\u2019ll just see. It depends on the make-up of the steering committee and what the issues are.\n\nShimkus seems pretty serious about pursuing this.\n\nHe and I are good friends. I\u2019m not opposed to Mr. Shimkus being chairman. He and Greg and Marsha waited their turn, and I understand that, but I was not treated fairly and I think they understand that.\n\nYou were treated unfairly in the 2010 race?\n\nWell, former Speaker Boehner came up with an interpretation that said time served in the minority counts as time served in the majority, and I had been ranking member for two terms. He said that\u2019s the same as if you\u2019d been chairman. That\u2019s absurd. The chairman sets the agenda for the committee, the ranking member of the minority reacts. The minority seldom ever wins a vote, or anything. The deck is stacked against the minority.\n\nThere needs to be an acknowledgment of that. I think the conference would acknowledge that. God help us if what former Speaker Boehner \u2014 if his interpretation is correct, why would anyone in their right mind ever be the ranking member? Why would you forgo a chance to be chairman by being ranking member? It\u2019d be stupid to. And it was not enunciated that way at the time the rules were put in place or while we were in the minority. It was an after-the-fact interpretation.\n\nBut, look, I\u2019m a big boy, I understand. There are not that many major committee chairmanships and the good news is we have a lot of qualified people who would do a good job. I just think the fact that I was chairman for one term shows what I can do and my ability to put together coalitions.\n\nIf you do get the gavel, what would you do with it?\n\nWe need to replace Obamacare \u2014 that\u2019s probably the single biggest issue. I think I could put together a bipartisan coalition to do that. I think FDA, NIH reform as a part of Obamacare reform would be things that could be helpful, and those are things I\u2019ve done before. In telecommunications, I think President Obama has not served the telecommunications industry well. His net-neutrality rules and some of the restrictions they\u2019ve put on the Internet, I don\u2019t think are helpful.\n\nAnd your energy priorities?\n\nTo try to bring fairness into the environmental laws. I don\u2019t want to gut the Clean Air Act or the Clean Water Act, but, at the same time, I think you can have effective environmental protection and still have natural-resource development and commonsense air regulations and things like that. The president\u2019s Clean Power Plan is terrible. These latest ozone proposals are unnecessary in my opinion. I don\u2019t think they\u2019re science based. So, just kind of reform the environmental laws so you have real protection but you have more of a balance between economic growth and environmental protection.", "article_metadata": {"description": "First Word Energy's Catherine Traywick sat down with Joe Barton to chat about why he wants to return as chairman of the Energy and Commerce committee.", "generator": "Powered by Visual Composer - drag and drop page builder for WordPress.", "og": {"site_name": "Bloomberg Government", "description": "First Word Energy's Catherine Traywick sat down with Joe Barton to chat about why he wants to return as chairman of the Energy and Commerce committee.", "title": "Joe Barton: The oil champion wants another shot at energy gavel", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://about.bgov.com/content/uploads/sites/12/2016/05/joe-barton.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-05-12T16:16:26+00:00", "url": "http://about.bgov.com/blog/joe-barton-the-oil-champion-wants-another-shot-at-energy-gavel/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Bloomberg Government", "title": "Joe Barton: The oil champion wants another shot at energy gavel", "image": {"src": "http://about.bgov.com/content/uploads/sites/12/2016/05/joe-barton.jpg"}, "card": "summary", "description": "First Word Energy's Catherine Traywick sat down with Joe Barton to chat about why he wants to return as chairman of the Energy and Commerce committee."}, "article": {"section": "Bloomberg Exclusives", "published_time": "2016-05-09T12:05:41+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-05-12T16:16:26+00:00"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1,user-scalable=no,maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Well, you\u2019ve got three or four people that have never been a committee chairman \u2014John Shimkus and Greg Walden would probably be the top two.\nGod help us if what former Speaker Boehner \u2014 if his interpretation is correct, why would anyone in their right mind ever be the ranking member?\nIf you want to have an activist committee in the next Congress, I would be a committee chairman that could make things happen.\nWhy would you forgo a chance to be chairman by being ranking member?\nThe chairman sets the agenda for the committee, the ranking member of the minority reacts."}
