Yet we routinely ride in airplanes and \u201cnormal\u201d cars that can\u2019t function without computers.\n\n\u201cSelf-driving\u201d cars that require a driver to seize control in any emergency are already being tested on America\u2019s highways. Only Google, however, seems to be focused on the direct path to truly driverless cars. After seven years and almost a million miles of testing, there have been 11 fender-benders but no injuries. According to Google project manager Chris Urmson, \u201cNot once was the self-driving car the cause of the accident.\u201d\n\nGoogle expects to have a finished product by 2020, though widespread adoption may take a decade or more. But driverless cars are coming, and they will change our lives.\n\nMost people won\u2019t choose to own these vehicles. A few button clicks on a smartphone will bring a driverless car to your door in minutes, a car with shared real-time traffic data to quickly get you where you\u2019re going \u2014 all for less than 40 cents a mile.\n\nIf you are willing to share a ride, you\u2019ll pay half as much. The mobility service dispatch software will arrange everything. You can even request a ride-share with someone of the same gender or age group. Plus, your fellow traveler will be well known to and pre-screened by your mobility service.\n\nRide-sharing also means you\u2019ll have access to HOV lanes. Denver\u2019s average of 1.07 commuters per vehicle will jump, and congestion will plummet. Why? Because ride-sharing is hassle-free and half the cost. Ten miles for two bucks; just kick back and enjoy door-to-door service with no parking hassles.\n\nBy buying miles instead of metal, you\u2019ll save thousands of dollars a year \u2014 no insurance or car payments, no pumping gas, no parking tickets, none of the many hassles of owning a car. Instead of fighting rush-hour traffic, you\u2019ll be able to read, watch the news, or catch up on e-mails. It\u2019s just like a chauffeur-driven service, but for less than bus fare. Marketing wizards call that \u201ca compelling value proposition.\u201d\n\nHere is a glimpse of what life in that driverless car future will look like:\n\n\u2022 Driverless cars will be far safer than any vehicle currently on the road. Unlike human drivers, they are immune to the distraction, fatigue, road rage, impatience, intoxication and mistakes that cause 93 percent of all accidents. In the U.S. alone, most of the 250,000 injuries and 30,000 lives now lost every year in car crashes will be avoided.\n\n\u2022 Remember lining up at the DMV to get your license when you turned 16? According to the U.S. Department of Transportation, only half of today\u2019s teenagers aged 16 to 19 have even bothered to get a driver\u2019s license. Many care more about having the latest smartphone than having a car. Mobility services will drive them to school, sports and social activities.\n\n\u2022 Parents will save thousands compared to buying and maintaining a car, a lesson not lost on their kids. Have you priced insurance for a 16-year-old lately? Over-scheduled, carpooling parents will get their lives back. Politicians will be forced to stop talking about \u201csoccer moms.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Texting while driving will disappear as the leading cause of death for teenagers. Arrests \u2014 or worse \u2014 for drinking while driving will plummet.\n\n\u2022 Passengers will safely use phones, laptops or tablets. Some will shop online, socialize, or Facebook with friends. Without the distraction of driving, some humans may actually talk to each other.\n\n\u2022 People can use their commute to wrap up a work report. No one will ever have to worry about parking and then walking in sleet, snow or rain. They will arrive at work and home free of the stress of rush-hour driving.\n\n\u2022 When seniors decide to give up their keys, they will not only keep their independence but save money as well. Instead of depending on their kids, they will have more freedom than ever to control their own lives. A lift to the grocery store, the golf course, or their grandkids\u2019 soccer game will be a few button clicks away. And that means many more years of living independently in the home they love.\n\n\u2022 Disabled customers will enjoy on-call, door-to-door service in specialized vehicles. The working poor will at last have cheap, reliable transportation, making it possible to hold higher-paying jobs. Working single mothers will spend more time with their kids and less time waiting for bus transfers and getting to and from their first and last bus stops.\n\n\u2022 Driverless cars will provide far better transit service than local buses, and for less money. And by integrating driverless cars with light rail, we can eliminate mass transit\u2019s \u201cfirst mile/last mile\u201d problem and drive ridership to far higher levels.\n\n\u2022 Those who drink alcohol will at least travel safely, without fear of the crushing financial and social damage of a DUI and without risking death or serious injuries to themselves or their innocent victims. Judges will be more likely to revoke the licenses of drunken drivers, knowing they aren\u2019t imposing terrible economic hardships on their families.\n\n\u2022 Unless gasoline drops well below $1 a gallon, for economic reasons these cars will mostly be electric. Burning less oil and using more electricity from renewables and from the new lower-emission natural gas generators will have a positive impact on climate change and Colorado\u2019s air quality.\n\nIn his comprehensive analysis of the automotive industry, \u201cThe Great Race: The Global Quest for the Car of the Future,\u201d Levi Tillemann observed, \u201cThe transition to electric and driverless cars will usher forth a step-change in both quality of life and economic productivity, and potentially be the most transformational social development since the World Wide Web. It will change the way we live and many of the fundamentals of the global economy.\u201d\n\nIf you truly love cars, mobility services are definitely not for you. For many people, their car is an important expression of who they are. But if you just want inexpensive transportation to safely take you from here to there in the least time and with the least hassle, driverless car mobility services will be a godsend.\n\nThere is, however, a darker side to this disruptive technology. Since each shared mobility vehicle can replace at least five personal vehicles, there will be far fewer cars sold and maintained. While families will save thousands of dollars a year, the auto industry will see a major drop in sales. An oversupply of used cars will cause prices to fall as more people make the switch. The oil industry will be hard-hit, as will insurers, personal injury attorneys, and a few other employers.\n\nBut for most of us, driverless cars will mean lower stress, more disposable income, and a major improvement in our quality of life.\n\nRutt Bridges lives in Greenwood Village.
