The argument escalated, and Papelbon reached out with his left hand and grabbed Harper by the throat.\n\nPapelbon then shoved the outfielder toward the bench with both hands, before teammates pulled the pair apart.\n\n\u201cI mean, he apologized, so, whatever,\u201d Harper said with a shrug afterward in the clubhouse, messy smears of eyeblack on his cheeks. \u201cI really don\u2019t care.\u201d\n\nAsked whether he had tangled with a teammate before, Harper responded: \u201cUsually fighting the other team.\u201d\n\nPapelbon said: \u201cI\u2019m in the wrong there. \u2026 For me, I can\u2019t allow that to happen in the middle of a game. You can handle that after the games or allow the manager to handle that. So in that light of it, I\u2019m wrong.\u201d\n\nNationals manager Matt Williams, whose highly touted team was officially eliminated from playoff contention Saturday, delivered terse answers during a briefer-than-usual postgame news conference.\n\n\u201cCertainly there\u2019s a lot of testosterone flowing among young men competing. What I can tell you is this: This is a family issue and we\u2019ll deal with it that way,\u201d Williams said. \u201cThere was an altercation in the dugout, and we\u2019ll leave it at that.\u201d\n\nHe said there hadn\u2019t been any discussion yet about whether the team might suspend Papelbon, who was acquired from the Phillies in a trade in late July in hopes of a possible postseason push.\n\nOn Wednesday, Papelbon plunked Baltimore star Manny Machado and was ejected from that game; afterward Harper called the hit-by-pitch \u201ctired\u201d and worried aloud about whether the Orioles would retaliate by beaning him. Papelbon was suspended for three games by Major League Baseball for hitting Machado but appealed, allowing him to continue playing.\n\nOn Sunday, Harper was replaced in right field for the ninth. He went 0 for 4 for the Nationals, who began the season as World Series favorites. Already out of the chase for a wild-card berth, their playoff hopes ended completely Saturday when the New York Mets mathematically clinched the NL East title.\n\nHarper entered Sunday leading the league in batting average (.339), homers (41), slugging percentage (.663) and on-base percentage (.470).\n\nPapelbon (4-3), who entered in the eighth, went back to the mound for the ninth in what was a 4-all game. He allowed five runs, including Andres Blanco\u2019s go-ahead, two-run homer.\n\nWhy did Williams keep Papelbon in the game after the scrap?\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s our closer,\u201d Williams said. \u201cThat\u2019s all I\u2019m going to say on the matter. He\u2019s our closer. In a tie game, he\u2019s in the ballgame in the ninth inning.\u201d\n\nAfter Blanco\u2019s homer, Papelbon loaded the bases, hitting Odubel Herrera with his final pitch before being removed by Williams \u2014 and leaving the mound to a chorus of boos from the Nationals Park crowd of 28,661.\n\n\u201cSometimes, emotions spill over and that\u2019s what happened today,\u201d Papelbon said. \u201cIt\u2019s happened for hundreds of years in this game and I think it will continue to happen.\u201d\n\nWhen a reporter asked Phillies outfielder Jeff Francoeur if this was a good win for his team, he offered a wry reply: \u201cBetter fight.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Bryce Harper, Jonathan Papelbon get into dugout fight", "title": "Bryce Harper, Jonathan Papelbon get into dugout fight", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/09/27/bryce-harper-jonathan-papelbon-get-into-dugout-fight/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150927_035425_bryce-harper.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150927_035425_bryce-harper.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2015-09-27T15:53:06+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-22T00:06:53+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "After a flyout in the eighth inning of what became a 12-5 loss to the Philadelphia Phillies, Harper headed to the dugout, where he and Papelbon, the team\u2019s closer, exchanged words.\nThe argument escalated, and Papelbon reached out with his left hand and grabbed Harper by the throat.\n\u201cHe\u2019s our closer,\u201d Williams said.\nWASHINGTON \u2014 NL MVP front-runner Bryce Harper and teammate Jonathan Papelbon got into a fight during a game Sunday, when a Washington Nationals season that long ago spiraled out of control on the field did so in the dugout.\n\u201cI mean, he apologized, so, whatever,\u201d Harper said with a shrug afterward in the clubhouse, messy smears of eyeblack on his cheeks."}
