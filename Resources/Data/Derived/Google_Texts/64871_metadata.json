However, there are often significant limitations to that coverage, especially for women. Because of the Hobby Lobby ruling, religious employers can neglect to cover contraceptive costs for their employees, and at the state level there has been a wave of restrictions on insurance coverage of abortion.\n\nPrior to the ACA, the majority of private insurance plans covered abortion care, but the new health care law reignited a national debate over the use of government funds for abortion coverage. In 2011, 92 state-level abortion restrictions were enacted, followed by 43 more in 2012, and 70 in 2013. Changes in state legislatures after the 2010 election only made it easier for these bills to pass.\n\nIn the months leading up to the passage of the ACA, women\u2019s health groups anticipated the restrictions, hoping lawmakers wouldn\u2019t use the debate over health care reform as an opportunity to clamp down on abortion. Planned Parenthood put it simply: \u201cSingling out abortion for exclusion from plans in a health insurance exchange is both discriminatory and harmful to women\u2019s health.\u201d\n\nWhich states restrict insurance coverage of abortion?\n\nA recent report from the Guttmacher Institute provides a comprehensive list of state restrictions on abortion coverage. As of April 2015, 10 states severely restrict all insurance coverage of abortion, and 25 states severely restrict plans available from the health insurance exchanges. Some states allow insurance companies to offer supplemental coverage, but this has been criticized as an impractical option that just leads to more restrictions.\n\nIn every U.S. state, there are at least some limitations placed on abortion coverage, such as for federal employees and people on Medicaid. In fact, all federal employees have been prohibited from choosing a health plan that covers abortion since 1983, apart from a brief reversal from 1993 to 1994. Since its reinstatement in 1995, the ban has persisted.\n\nThe 10 states with active abortion coverage bans are Idaho, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Michigan, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, Oklahoma, and Utah. Indiana allows exceptions for life endangerment, rape, incest, and severe health impairment, as does Utah, with the addition of fetal impairment. The other eight states only allow coverage in the case of life endangerment.\n\nThe ACLU and ThinkProgress each published an interactive map detailing the specifics of each state\u2019s restrictions on insurance coverage of abortion. ThinkProgress also includes other legal barriers to abortion services, as well as cost range, number of abortion clinics, and number of women of reproductive age.\n\n\n\nSource: Thinkstock Source: Thinkstock\n\nHow much does an abortion cost?\n\nAmerican women already face lower wages and higher health care costs than men. On top of that, low-income women in several states are now being priced out of their right to choose abortion. Depending on the circumstances, the out-of-pocket cost of terminating a pregnancy can be extremely high and even prohibitive.\n\nPlanned Parenthood estimates the cost of abortion to be up to $800 for the abortion pill and up to $1500 for an in-clinic abortion. Prices vary across the U.S., but according to national data collected by ThinkProgress, out-of-pocket costs for an abortion can range anywhere from $375 in the first trimester to $6,531 at 22 weeks.\n\nResearchers at the University of California, San Francisco, found that more than 4,000 women were denied abortions in 2008 for being past the gestational limit, largely because it took them too long to save up the money to pay for it. Nearly six in 10 said they couldn\u2019t get an abortion earlier because of travel and procedure costs. In some states, transportation costs can be the biggest obstacle due to a shortage of abortion clinics.\n\nJane Collins, a professor and researcher at the University of Wisconsin, told ThinkProgress, \u201cI think people have a hard time grasping that $600 can be an absolute barrier. It can be the difference between having your civil rights and not having them.\u201d\n\nMore from Personal Finance Cheat Sheet:", "article_metadata": {"syndication-source": "http://www.cheatsheet.com/personal-finance/these-10-states-banned-insurance-coverage-of-abortion.html/", "sailthru.author": "chloe-della-costa", "news_keywords": "Michigan,Utah,Missouri,women's health,State Laws,heath care,Oklahoma,Affordable Care Act,women,California", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Cheat Sheet", "description": "In the midst of the ongoing health care debate, there has been a wave of state restrictions on health insurance coverage of abortion.", "title": "These 10 States Banned Insurance Coverage of Abortion", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/458288049-e1413323135482.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-04-14T15:45:09-04:00", "url": "http://www.cheatsheet.com/personal-finance/these-10-states-banned-insurance-coverage-of-abortion.html/?a=viewall", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "In the midst of the ongoing health care debate, there has been a wave of state restrictions on health insurance coverage of abortion.", "creator": "@cheatsheet", "image": "http://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/161571521-e1402946604252.jpg", "title": "These 10 States Banned Insurance Coverage of Abortion", "site": "@cheatsheet", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "The Cheat Sheet", "robots": "noodp", "DC.date.issued": "2015-04-14T10:04:03-04:00", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "p": {"domain_verify": "936edf149ecbc3171d89b1f25f05e153"}, "fb": {"admins": 826582091, "app_id": 354932851235506}, "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/161571521-e1402946604252-150x100.jpg", "google-site-verification": "ktiOxQqv9Xlcn7qytDrsOVw_-MQ9S7bo2G5Iyfu-I9M", "sailthru.tags": "money-career,life,budgeting,health,michigan,utah,missouri", "sailthru.date": "2015-04-14 10:04:03", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wallstcheatsheet", "section": "Budgeting", "tag": "women's health", "published_time": "2015-04-14T10:04:03-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-04-14T15:45:09-04:00"}, "sailthru.image.full": "http://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/161571521-e1402946604252.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "description": "In the midst of the ongoing health care debate, there has been a wave of state restrictions on health insurance coverage of abortion."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9ed1\"", "article_summary": "As of April 2015, 10 states severely restrict all insurance coverage of abortion, and 25 states severely restrict plans available from the health insurance exchanges.\nPlanned Parenthood put it simply: \u201cSingling out abortion for exclusion from plans in a health insurance exchange is both discriminatory and harmful to women\u2019s health.\u201dWhich states restrict insurance coverage of abortion?\nThe ACLU and ThinkProgress each published an interactive map detailing the specifics of each state\u2019s restrictions on insurance coverage of abortion.\nPrior to the ACA, the majority of private insurance plans covered abortion care, but the new health care law reignited a national debate over the use of government funds for abortion coverage.\nThe 10 states with active abortion coverage bans are Idaho, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Michigan, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, Oklahoma, and Utah."}
