Raul Ruiz for his Riverside County congressional seat in 2016.\n\nLupe Ramos Watson filed paperwork with the Federal Election Commssion last week to run in the 36th Congressional District, which covers the Coachella Valley, the Pass, Hemet and San Jacinto. Ruiz, D-Palm Desert, has represented the district since 2012, when he defeated veteran GOP Rep. Mary Bono.\n\nAn Indio native, Watson, a Republican, has been on Indio\u2019s council since 2004. She owned a small business specializing in engineering and commercial planning and a real estate investment firm, according to her council campaign website.\n\nIn a videotaped interview posted on the Desert Sun\u2019s website, Watson said she believes her message will resonate with voters.\n\n\u201cI believe that the voters know me, they trust me,\u201d she said. \u201c \u2026 They\u2019re tired of Washington antics. They\u2019re tired of where we are as a country. And they\u2019re ready for change.\u201d\n\nWatson\u2019s remarks show her to be an unconventional Republican. In the video, she said the district needs immigration reform.\n\n\u201cOur district is highly reliant on not only that labor force for the agriculture community plus also for the tourism industry,\u201d she said.\n\nWhile she said more time should have been taken to make sure the Affordable Care Act was understood, Watson added: \u201cI do believe at the end of the day, it\u2019s a better system than what we had before.\u201d\n\nWatson caused a stir earlier this year, when she did away with the traditional invocation to start council meetings. She was quoted as saying she did not think the practice was appropriate for a government meeting.\n\nThe district\u2019s voter registration leans ever-so-slightly to the GOP. Watson has been re-elected repeatedly in a city with more registered Democrats than Republicans.\n\nStill, Watson told the Desert Sun she knows she faces an uphill battle in trying to unseat Ruiz, who defeated Republican Assemblyman Brian Nestande last year and had almost $688,000 in reserve campaign funds as of March 31.\n\nRuiz also could be helped by 2016 being a presidential election. Higher voter turnout in those elections tends to favor Democratic candidates.\n\nThe Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee put Ruiz on a list of vulnerable Democrats in need of extra help while the National Republican Congressional Committee has targeted Ruiz for defeat in 2016.", "article_metadata": {"geo.region": "US-CA", "sailthru.author": "JEFF HORSEMAN", "content_author": "JEFF HORSEMAN", "ICBM": "33.948100, -117.396100", "sailthru.tags": "blogs, indio, ruiz, congressional, mayor, challenge, raul, watson, rep, district, valley", "content_section": "blogs", "content_title": "CONGRESS: Indio mayor to challenge Raul Ruiz in 2016", "geo.position": "33.948100;-117.396100", "author": "JEFF HORSEMAN", "section": "blogs", "sailthru.date": "2015-04-22 09:49:11", "sailthru.title": "Blog: Political Empire:CONGRESS: Indio mayor to challenge Raul Ruiz in 2016", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nn7vyf-watson.jpg", "geo.placename": "Riverside", "fb": {"app_id": 1413700038878423}, "content_thumbnail": "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nn7vyf-watson.jpg", "content_type": "article", "publication_date": "2015-04-22", "Description": "CONGRESS: Indio mayor to challenge Raul Ruiz in 2016 | indio, ruiz, congressional, mayor, challenge, raul, watson, rep, district, valley", "og": {"site_name": "Press Enterprise", "description": "CONGRESS: Indio mayor to challenge Raul Ruiz in 2016 | indio, ruiz, congressional, mayor, challenge, raul, watson, rep, district, valley", "title": "Blog: Political Empire:CONGRESS: Indio mayor to challenge Raul Ruiz in 2016", "locale": "en", "image": "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/article/nn7vyf-watson.jpg", "url": "http://www.pe.com/articles/indio-765430-ruiz-congressional.html", "type": "article"}, "Keywords": "indio, ruiz, congressional, mayor, challenge, raul, watson, rep, district, valley", "sailthru.image.full": "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/nn7vyf-watson.jpg"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9c39\"", "article_summary": "The mayor of Indio is planning to challenge Rep.
