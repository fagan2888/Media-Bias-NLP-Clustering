After The New York Times published a piece last week about the world of super PAC fundraising (namely the activities of the emerging Clinton fundraising machine seemingly led by fundraiser Mary Pat Bonner), Brock concluded that Priorities was planning \u201can orchestrated political hit job\u201d against American Bridge and Media Matters. Brock is the founder of both organizations, the latter of which is dedicated to monitoring alleged misinformation disseminated by right-leaning media outlets.\n\nIt was also revealed that Bonner was paid a 12.5 percent commission fee for monies raised on behalf of Brock\u2019s organizations; a point of contention with another group of wealthy liberal donors at Democracy Alliance. Bonner still works with the group, but as an \u201cunpaid donor adviser,\u201d according to the Times [emphasis mine]:\n\nEarly in the cycle, American Bridge wanted a larger portion of shared fund-raising so it could begin tracking and researching Republican candidates. The other groups thought that Ms. Bonner was seeking to establish her client as a central financial clearinghouse for other Democratic groups. \u2026 Mr. Brock credits Ms. Bonner with helping persuade donors that news media monitoring and opposition research deserve large-scale financial support. His groups brought in more than $28 million in 2014, entitling Ms. Bonner\u2019s firm to about $3.5 million in fees. Her commission represented his entire fund-raising overhead, Mr. Brock said, which compared favorably with that of other nonprofit groups. ... One Alliance donor, the billionaire Boston investor Vin Ryan, said that he had not been informed of Ms. Bonner\u2019s commission before donating to Media Matters and later demanded a written guarantee from the group that his contributions would be exempt. \u201cI don\u2019t know what her role in the D.A. is at this point, nor do I know who she actually is a donor adviser to, nor do I know what organizations she represents within the group of organizations who we are supporting,\u201d Mr. Ryan said. \u201cI think it\u2019s outrageous.\u201d\n\nWhen Brock announced his exit, Priorities released a statement of their own saying they wanted to address the issues he had raised. Brock corroborated this angle of the story after discussions with several other members, saying he\u2019s open to returning to the PAC (via Politico) [emphasis mine]:\n\nIn his letter to the co-chairs of Priorities\u2019 board \u2014 former Michigan Gov. Jennifer Granholm and former Obama campaign manager Jim Messina \u2014 Brock alleged that \u201ccurrent and former Priorities officials were behind this specious and malicious attack on the integrity of these critical organizations.\u201d The letter \u2014 and Brock\u2019s resignation \u2014 offer a rare glimpse into a network of groups upon which Democrats are relying to keep the White House and stave off increasingly robust big-money efforts on the right. The public airing of dirty laundry comes as sources say Priorities is struggling to live up to the hopes of some Clinton allies, who had argued it should aim to raise as much as $500 million to eviscerate prospective Clinton rivals in the primary and general elections. \u2026 Priorities spokesman Peter Kauffmann denied that Priorities had anything to do with the Times story, which also noted that his group paid fundraising commissions on at least $2 million worth of checks, including contributions from California tech billionaire Irwin Jacobs. Sources say Jacobs was upset by the revelations. Kauffmann said Priorities no longer pays fundraising commissions and that it maintains close working relationships with the other groups boosting Clinton. \u201cPriorities USA Action and allied organizations demonstrated a clear ability to work together effectively in 2012 and we look to replicate that success again in 2016,\u201d he said. By early evening \u2014 hours after POLITICO broke the news of Brock\u2019s resignation \u2014 Priorities USA Action issued a conciliatory statement from Granholm saying that the group was \u201cworking to address\u201d Brock\u2019s concerns, while Brock issued one saying he was \u201copen to returning to the board.\u201d\n\nAmerican Bridge is the organization that wrote a 950-page opposition research file on Mitt Romney that was used by Priorities USA. The National Journal reported that nearly $70 million dollars worth of ads were generated because of it.\n\nFirst, Team Hillary was fighting over when the former Secretary of State should make her 2016 announcement, one where almost everyone assumes she\u2019s going to mount a presidential campaign. Now, key players are bolting due to conspiracy theories within their own ranks.\n\n\n\nThis break in the ranks surely provided a popcorn moment for conservatives.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Popcorn..05/26/2016 19:31:53PM EST.", "author": "Matt Vespa", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Popcorn.", "title": "Matt Vespa - Key Clinton Ally Bolts From Super PAC, Alleges 'Political Hit Job' On Other Pro-Hillary Groups", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/mattvespa/2015/02/10/key-clinton-ally-bolts-from-super-pac-alleges-political-hit-job-on-other-prohillary-groups-n1955703", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2014/163/cefef098-b2be-430e-8f90-4d815c267ca0.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "Popcorn.", "title": "Matt Vespa - Key Clinton Ally Bolts From Super PAC, Alleges 'Political Hit Job' On Other Pro-Hillary Groups", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/mattvespa/2015/02/10/key-clinton-ally-bolts-from-super-pac-alleges-political-hit-job-on-other-prohillary-groups-n1955703", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2014/163/cefef098-b2be-430e-8f90-4d815c267ca0.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Key Clinton Ally Bolts From Super PAC, Alleges 'Political Hit Job' On Other Pro-Hillary Groups, Matt Vespa, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "Yesterday, the turmoil within Team Hillary seemed to have reached a new level with the resignation of David Brock from the board of the liberal super PAC Priorities USA.\nThe other groups thought that Ms. Bonner was seeking to establish her client as a central financial clearinghouse for other Democratic groups.\nKauffmann said Priorities no longer pays fundraising commissions and that it maintains close working relationships with the other groups boosting Clinton.\nHis groups brought in more than $28 million in 2014, entitling Ms. Bonner\u2019s firm to about $3.5 million in fees.\nHer commission represented his entire fund-raising overhead, Mr. Brock said, which compared favorably with that of other nonprofit groups."}
