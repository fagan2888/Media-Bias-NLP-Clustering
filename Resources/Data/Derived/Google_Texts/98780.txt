As letter mail dies out, campus mailrooms clogged with packages

On a bright December afternoon a few days before winter break, freshman Ryan Case strode into the mailroom at the University of Colorado's Kittredge Central Hall.

Though rows of tiny gold mailboxes gleamed in the midday sun, Case was after something else — a box stashed behind the front desk containing a flannel shirt his mom ordered online and shipped to him at school.

Aside from some fliers, a magazine or two and the paper slip that students must show a mailroom employee to retrieve a package, CU's student mailboxes are mostly empty these days, replaced instead by rooms full of boxes, many bearing Amazon's smile-like logo.

"Convenience," Case said of why his generation is prone to ordering online. "It's a lot easier than having to go into a store. You don't have to deal with other people, other shoppers, wait in line, navigate the mall. Stuff like that."

Some campuses have seen such a shift in students' mail habits that they're taking drastic steps, including removing dorm mailboxes entirely and redesigning buildings to increase storage space for packages.

In the last two years, CU has seen a 15 percent increase in packages processed through Housing and Dining Services, which began contracting with UPS to handle all student mail services in 2013.

At Arizona State University, which contracts with the same UPS franchise owner, the number of packages processed grew from 60,614 in 2009-2010 to 113,140 in 2014-2015 — an 86 percent increase, according to Lauren Teich, general manager for UPS at the two campuses.

Teich said the universities do not track letter volume, but the U.S. Postal Service reports that first-class single piece mail volume — mail bearing postage stamps such as bill payments, cards, letters and personal correspondence — declined 53 percent from 45.9 billion pieces in 2005 to 21.5 billion in 2014.

Meanwhile, package volumes grew 21 percent between 2008 and 2013, according to the postal service's statistics.

"Everybody has an iPhone. You can press a button on your phone and have something shipped to you," Teich said. "The connection there has made it very instantaneous for students."

Mailroom as bookstore, shopping mall

The generation of undergraduates attending college today came of age at the same time as Netflix, GrubHub, Uber, Spotify and a host of other on-demand goods-and-services providers.

They check their bank balances with mobile apps and send important documents by email.

Why should shopping be any different?

Online retailers like Amazon are capitalizing on students' need for instant everything — from textbooks to mini-fridges — with programs such as Amazon Student, which gives them free two-day shipping for the first six months.

The online giant this year also opened three brick-and-mortar stores at Purdue University, the University of California Davis and the University of Massachusetts Amherst.

"The amount of Amazon tape I saw in our back room after Black Friday was just astonishing to me," Teich said. "It's just like, 'Wow.' Students have such a hand in e-commerce it's crazy."

Students also are opting to rent their textbooks, rather than buy them, with help from online vendors such as Chegg — a company known among mailroom managers for its bright orange boxes — which means receiving and sending more packages at the start and end of each semester.

Parents are getting in on the online ordering game, too, by sending students items directly from retailers.

Campuses are taking notice. They're installing more shelves, buying more package scanners, creating new sorting systems and rearranging mailrooms to make way for more packages and fewer letters.

"While students are getting fewer letters from home, bills and other traditional mail, they are indeed doing more online shopping that necessitates the handling of larger parcels," said James Baumann, a spokesman for the Association of College and University Housing Officers International. "That means reconsidering the space set-ups of residence hall mailrooms and looking at policies and procedures about how students get notified about deliveries."

More packages, bigger space

At CU, package notification is as high-tech and instantaneous as the students' one-click ordering capabilities.

When UPS employees scan an incoming package, students receive an email letting them know it's available for pick-up.

During move-in days, CU brings in huge trailers to accommodate the uptick in large packages. More and more students are shipping themselves bedspreads and coffee makers directly from online retailers, rather than packing up mom and dad's car, Teich said.

The UPS stores at CU also offer summer storage for on- and off-campus students — they'll even deliver items to students' new addresses when they return from summer break.

Teich said the campus plans to adapt as future changes are needed.

"We just evolve with the times," she said.

When Indiana University in Bloomington, Ind., built Spruce Hall in 2013, campus officials thought long and hard about how the dorm's mailroom should function.

The university designed the dorm with roughly 25 percent more space for packages than other residence halls, said Patrick Connor, IU's executive director of residential programs and services for the last 15 years.

"In some of our older buildings, we had virtually no storage for packages," he said. "When you have a building of 500 or 600 students, you can imagine the amount of packages you might get."

No more mailboxes

Students at East Carolina University in Greenville, N.C., were getting so few letters that campus housing officials removed all residence hall mailboxes this summer.

"The amount of traditional letter mail that wasn't junk mail had dropped significantly," said Aaron Lucier, East Carolina's director of housing operations. "Students weren't checking them. The majority of their mail was packages that didn't fit in them anyway."

Now, everything is treated like a package. If a letter is delivered, students get an email and can pick it up from their residence neighborhood's front desk.

The idea to remove campus mailboxes started percolating two years ago, when Lucier and his team realized how much time staffers were wasting stuffing mailboxes with junk mail, which students promptly recycled.

At the same time, there weren't enough employees around to handle an increasing number of packages, Lucier said.

When crews removed the mailboxes, they turned that extra space into study lounges for students and made more room for packages by reconfiguring storage space and adding shelving.

"It's space and security," said Lucier, who has worked in student housing for 20 years. "And being able to find stuff quickly. We don't have staff time for them to look for a package for three minutes."

Lucier said he believes East Carolina University is one of the first colleges to remove dorm mailboxes entirely, but he expects other campuses to follow suit sooner than later.

Campus mailrooms largely go unnoticed — until they're no longer keeping up with students.

"It's one of those systems where, when it's running well and it's doing well, it's probably somewhat invisible," Lucier said. "But when you notice changes like running out of space or needing to hire more staff to handle packages, then it brings attention to it."
