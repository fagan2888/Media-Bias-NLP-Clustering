The annual Martin Luther King Jr. march and rally will be celebrated on Monday in Denver.

People wanting to participate in the “Marade” — a march and parade, combined — should gather at 10 a.m. in City Park at 17th Avenue and Colorado Boulevard, according to event organizers.

Marade formation will begin following the 10 a.m. program, and the march will start at 10:45 a.m. from the Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. memorial in the park.

The route heads south out of the park on Esplanade Street to Colfax Avenue. Participants will march west on Colfax Avenue to Sherman Street into the State Capitol grounds, ending at Civic Center Park.

A program in the park’s Greek theater immediately follows the Marade, organizers said.

In 2015, 30,000 people gathered to honor King and keep his message alive.
