Grimes doesn\u2019t want to give her Republican opponent, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, any openings for an attack. Even in this age of scripted, on-message politicians, Grimes has stood out for her, uh, discipline. When I was writing an article about the Kentucky Senate race last year, just scoring an interview with Grimes was an ordeal. After initially ignoring my interview requests, her campaign eventually told me that I could talk to her for 15 minutes before a rally she was doing in Owensboro, a river town in Western Kentucky. But on my 100-plus-mile drive to Owensboro from Louisville, I got a call on my cell phone from Grimes\u2019s press secretary telling me that the candidate was running late and the interview was off. When I and another reporter\u2014who\u2019d driven even farther, from Lexington\u2014tried to buttonhole Grimes after her speech, she pretended that she was talking on a cell phone and breezed past us. Finally, about a week later, I managed to get Grimes on the phone for about 10 minutes and, honestly, it was 10 minutes of my life that I\u2019ll never get back.\n\nWith McConnell doing everything he can to tie Grimes to Obama\u2014as one prominent Kentucky Democrat put it to me last year, \u201cThe only way they can beat [Grimes] is to paint her skin a different color than it is and make her gender a different gender than it is\u201d\u2014Grimes has apparently concluded that refusing to admit that she was one of the 62 million Americans (and one of the 679,000 Kentuckians) who preferred Obama to Mitt Romney in 2012 is some sort of victory. \u201cThere\u2019s a reason why McConnell hasn\u2019t run one ad of her talking,\u201d one Democratic strategist boasted to me. \u201cThat\u2019s amazing!\u201d\n\nWhile Grimes may have denied McConnell the ammo to convince Kentuckians to vote against her, she hasn\u2019t given the citizens of the commonwealth many good reasons to vote for her. The New Republic's Alec MacGillis has already criticized Grimes for not using Obamacare to her advantage, but it\u2019s even bigger than any single issue. Grimes\u2019s strategy has been to bank on McConnell\u2019s lack of popularity\u2014never a beloved pol among Kentuckians, his approval ratings tend to hover in the 40s\u2014and hope that, by dint of the fact that she\u2019s not McConnell, she\u2019ll win. That strategy has admittedly worked well with Democratic donors in places like New York and California, who so loathe McConnell that they've eagerly filled Grimes's campaign coffers. One Democratic aide told me that Grimes's national fundraising network is second only to Elizabeth Warren's. But Grimes's crippling caution and debilitating message discipline have done very little to boost her own standing with voters in Kentucky, at least those who don't already despise McConnell. In fact, it's probably harmed it: Grimes holds just a three-point lead over McConnell among female voters, the group that she was banking on to win big and carry her to victory. \u201cThe campaign has cocooned her so much that you don\u2019t get the fact that she\u2019s a bright, capable, smart young woman,\u201d says Jimmy Cauley, a Kentucky Democratic strategist who's been impressed by Grimes in his personal dealings with her. \u201cThey\u2019ve built this wall around her that hasn't allowed the good parts of her to get through. At some point voters have to know what she\u2019s about.\u201d\n\nThe builder of that wall, besides Grimes herself, is presumably her father, Jerry Lundergan. A former Kentucky Democratic Party chair and longtime friend of the Clinton\u2019s, Jerry has tried to keep a low public profile during the Senate race. But it\u2019s widely assumed that he\u2019s calling the shots in his daughter\u2019s campaign, which is being helmed by Kentucky political consultants long loyal to him. \u201cThere\u2019s nobody on the campaign that can look Jerry in the eye and say, \u2018No Jerry, we\u2019re not going to do that,'\u201d says Al Cross, the Courier-Journal\u2019s former chief political writer. And, in the end, Lundergan\u2019s Kentucky yes-men just don\u2019t appear to be up to the task of unseating McConnell. \u201cThey chose not to bring in national talent,\u201d says Cauley, \u201cand it\u2019s showing.\u201d\n\nMore to the point, Grimes's candidacy is showing just how absurd\u2014and ultimately self-defeating the modern political campaign has become. So preoccupied with not making mistakes, and demonizing the opponent, the modern political campaign often forgets what would seemingly be its most important task: to make an affirmative case for its candidate. If Grimes and Terri Lynn Land\u2014the Republican candidate for Senate in Michigan who's run a similarly bunkered race\u2014both go down to defeat, perhaps it'll serve as something of a wake-up call to strategists on both sides of the aisle.\n\nOn Monday night, Grimes will get what is probably her last, best shot at getting elected to the Senate: Her one, and only, debate against McConnell. She\u2019ll likely need a Romney-in-Denver-caliber performance to change the trend lines of this race, which FiveThirtyEight currently says McConnell has a 75 percent chance of winning. For a candidate who hasn\u2019t exactly shown a facility thus far for thinking on her feet, that might be a tall order. At the very least, you have to assume Grimes will have prepared a better response to the question of whether she voted for Obama.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "//assets.newrepublic.com/assets/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "It seems like a safe assumption that if you\u2019re currently a Democratic candidate for the U.S. Senate, you voted for Barack Obama two years ago.
