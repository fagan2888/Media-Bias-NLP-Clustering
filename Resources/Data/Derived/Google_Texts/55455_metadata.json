Veteran Natalie Coughlin won that race while setting a U.S. record of 27.51 seconds.\n\nFranklin has three events \u2014 the 100- and 200-meter backstrokes and the 100-meter freestyle \u2014 remaining at this meet, which runs through Sunday.\n\nThe other headliner at the Pro Swim Series event, 22-time Olympic medalist Michael Phelps, finished third in the men\u2019s 200-meter freestyle.\n\nConnor Jaeger won the race in 1:48.66, followed by Nikita Lobinstev (1:48.86) of Russia and Phelps (1:49.03). The time for Phelps was nearly a second slower than the 1:48.20 mark he put up in the 200-meter final at the same meet last year.\n\nPhelps will not compete at the world championships because of his DUI-related arrest last September.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Missy Franklin denied first win in pool as pro", "title": "Missy Franklin denied first win in pool as pro", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/06/19/missy-franklin-denied-first-win-in-pool-as-pro/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150619__missy-franklinp1-1.jpg", "height": 436}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150619__missy-franklinp1-1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-06-19T21:16:27+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-24T12:07:37+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcdd72\"", "article_summary": "The other headliner at the Pro Swim Series event, 22-time Olympic medalist Michael Phelps, finished third in the men\u2019s 200-meter freestyle.\nPhelps will not compete at the world championships because of his DUI-related arrest last September.\nThe Netherlands\u2019 Femke Heemskerk won the race in 1 minute, 55.68 seconds, followed by Hungary\u2019s Katinka Hosszu (1:56.88) and Franklin (1:57.02).\nThis is the first meet for Franklin since the NCAA championships in March, when she helped California win the team title.\nFranklin has three events \u2014 the 100- and 200-meter backstrokes and the 100-meter freestyle \u2014 remaining at this meet, which runs through Sunday."}
