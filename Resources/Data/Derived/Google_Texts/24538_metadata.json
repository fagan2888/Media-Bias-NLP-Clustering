I\u2019m the president \u2026 If in fact I could solve all these problems without passing laws in Congress then I would do so. \u2026 I\u2019m not the emperor of the United States. My job is to execute laws that are passed.\u201d \u2013Barack Obama\n\nAccording to a source within the Secret Service, Barack Obama refers to himself as \u201cThe Bear\u201d when diverting from a planned security route for \u201cmeet and greet photo ops.\u201d He announces such departures by saying, \u201cThe bear is loose!\u201d\n\nNow, I\u2019m sure it\u2019s only coincidence that \u201cThe Bear\u201d is also the mascot of the former Soviet Union, and now the Russian Federation. While it would be more fitting if Obama referred to himself as \u201cThe Red Squirrel,\u201d his wishful \u201cbear\u201d reference certainly reflects the tyrannical \u201crule of lawlessness\u201d that now defines his presidential modus operandi.\n\nObama\u2019s administration is now defined by his litany of lies and legacy of scandals, most notably this incomplete list of ignominy: The failure of his so-called \u201ceconomic recovery plan, his unparalleled foreign policy malfeasance, his \u201dFast and Furious\u201c gun control play, his long list of ObamaCare lies, his IRS Enemies List, the dramatic resurgence of al-Qa'ida, the Benghazi cover-up to protect his 2012 re-election bid, his hollow \u201dRed Line\u201c threat to Syria, the \u201dRussian Spring\u201c in Crimea, the Middle East meltdown in Egypt, Libya, Syria, Yemen, Jordan and Israel, the disintegration of Iraq, the rise of the Islamic State, the VA death panels cover-up, the immigration crisis on our southern border, the resignation of Eric Holder, the most lawless Attorney General in our nations history, and now, his failed policies to contain the Ebola threat, while ignoring Enterovirus D68 which is killing children nationwide, and refusing the real pandemic threat, Bio-Bombers.\n\nHe has certainly earned the public opinion title of \u201dworst president since WWII,\u201c which has negated the smidgeon of good faith he once held with congressional Republicans, and also most of that extended him by all but the most leftwing congressional Democrats.\n\nSo what\u2019s Obama to do?\n\nHaving lost control of the House in 2010 and having failed to recover it in 2012, and the pending threat of losing Democrat control of the Senate, Obama has launched, in earnest, a campaign to completely bypass Congress through executive and regulatory diktat, a bold and lawless endeavor unmatched in its unconstitutional offense, except perhaps by Franklin Delano Roosevelt\u2019s despotic regime.\n\nThe range of his executive and regulatory edicts has been very broad, from 19 executive orders constricting Second Amendment rights, to regulations supporting his \u201dwar on coal\u201c and avoiding the Keystone XL pipeline.\n\nBut the most notable abuses have included his repeated rewrites of the so-called \u201dAffordable Care Act,\u201c in order that it not wound the re-election campaigns of his congressional Democrats.\n\nNow, Obama is increasingly audacious in the exercise of these unlegislated diktats.\n\nIn November of last year, he pretended to be constrained by law in acting on immigration reform, saying, \"If, in fact, I could solve all these problems without passing this through Congress, then I would do so. But we\u2019re also a nation of laws. That\u2019s part of our tradition.\u201d\n\nBut a few months later, Obama proclaimed, \u201cWhere Congress isn\u2019t acting, I\u2019ll act on my own.\u201d He complained that \u201cwe can\u2019t wait\u201d for Congress, and bragged that he\u2019s \u201cgetting things done\u201d by disregarding Rule of Law and the separation of powers set forth in our Constitution.\n\n\u201c[W]e are not just going to be waiting for legislation in order to make sure that we\u2019re providing Americans the kind of help that they need,\u201d he brazenly declared. \u201cI\u2019ve got a pen \u2026 and I can use that pen to sign executive orders and take executive actions and administrative actions that move the ball forward.\u201d\n\nThese are the words of a despot, and now define Obama\u2019s standard operating procedure, whether secretly ordering the \u201cTaliban Five\u201d terrorist trade for an Army deserter, or choking the economy with his executive and regulatory orders, ostensibly to halt \u201cglobal warming.\u201d\n\nThough Obama claims to be a \u201cprofessor of constitutional law,\u201d a genuine constitutional scholar, George Washington University\u2019s Jonathan Turley, a self-acknowledged liberal Obama supporter, has offered severe criticism of Obama\u2019s \u201cuber presidency,\u201d his abuse of executive orders and regulations to bypass Congress.\n\nTestifying before Congress, Turley said, \u201cWhen the president went to Congress and said he would go it alone, it obviously raises a concern. There\u2019s no license for going it alone in our system, and what he\u2019s done, is very problematic. He\u2019s told agencies not to enforce some laws [and] has effectively rewritten laws through the active interpretation that I find very problematic.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur system is changing in a dangerous and destabilizing way,\u201d Turley notes. \u201cWhat\u2019s emerging is an imperial presidency, an \u00fcber presidency, as I\u2019ve called it. \u2026 The president\u2019s pledge to effectively govern alone is alarming but what is most alarming is his ability to fulfill that pledge. When a president can govern alone, he can become a government unto himself, which is precisely the danger that the Framers sought to avoid in the establishment of our tripartite system of government. \u2026 Obama has repeatedly violated this [separation of powers] doctrine in the circumvention of Congress in areas ranging from health care to immigration law to environmental law. \u2026 What we are witnessing today is one of the greatest challenges to our constitutional system in the history of this country. We are in the midst of a constitutional crisis with sweeping implications for our system of government. There could be no greater danger for individual liberty. I think the framers would be horrified. \u2026 We are now at the constitutional tipping point for our system.\u201d\n\nReread those words for their full effect\u2026\n\nIn his 1973 volume, \u201cThe Imperial Presidency,\u201d noted liberal historian Arthur Schlesinger, a key adviser to John F. Kennedy, outlined the extreme danger to Liberty posed by lawless executive overreach. At that time, his focus was on Richard Nixon, but his warnings, like those of Turley, have far more application to Barack Obama.\n\nSo, with 30 more months of Obama\u2019s escalating assault on Liberty, what now? Make no mistake \u2013 this \u201clame duck\u201d is anything but.\n\nTurley advises, \u201cIf balance is to be reestablished, it must begin before [Obama] leaves office, and that will likely require every possible means to reassert legislative authority. No one in our system can \u2018go it alone\u2019 \u2013 not Congress, not the courts, and not the President.\u201d\n\nAs the ever-erudite Dr. Charles Krauthammer notes, \u201c[Obama\u2019s] gross executive usurpation disdains the Constitution. It mocks the separation of powers. And most consequentially, it introduces a fatal instability into law itself. If the law is not what is plainly written, but is whatever the president and his agents decide, what\u2019s left of the law? \u2026 This president is not only untroubled by what he\u2019s doing, but open and rather proud. As he tells cheering crowds on his never-ending campaign-style tours: \u2018I am going to do X \u2013 and I\u2019m not going to wait for Congress.\u2019 That\u2019s caudillo talk. That\u2019s banana republic stuff. In this country, the president is required to win the consent of Congress first. At stake is not some constitutional curlicue. At stake is whether the laws are the law. And whether presidents get to write their own.\u201d\n\nOf course, I think the good doctor would agree, given his sterling psychiatric credentials, that the rise of Obama\u2019s imperial presidency was entirely predictable, given that he is a textbook case study in Narcissistic Personality Disorder.\n\nSpeaking in Texas last week, Obama\u2019s egomaniacal arrogance shined through with his lavish first-person references \u2013 \u201cI,\u201d \u201cme\u201d and \u201cmy\u201d (199 times in all) \u2013 when outlining upcoming plans to unilaterally dictate \u201cimmigration reform\u201d and additional \u201ceconomic measures.\u201d\n\nThis week, he made clear his intent to unilaterally advance his populist \u201cclass warfare agenda\u201d to \u201chelp working Americans \u2026 when Congress won\u2019t act.\u201d In his latest weekly address, Obama insisted, \u201cSo far this year, Republicans in Congress have blocked every serious idea to strengthen the middle class.\u201d\n\nThat lie earned him a stern rebuke from even The Washington Post\u2019s Fact Checker, as did his earlier claim that Republicans \u201chave filibustered about 500 pieces of legislation that would help the middle class,\u201d about which The Post concluded, \u201cOn just about every level, this claim is ridiculous.\u201d But for Obama\u2019s sycophantic legions of useful idiots, fiction trumps fact.\n\nSo what can Republicans do?\n\nPlenty, if they are willing to fight fire with fire, and they better start igniting those precedents now. It\u2019s going to take more than a threat of a lawsuit from House Speaker John Boehner.\n\nHouse Republicans can use their control of the budget to defund enactment and enforcement of Obama\u2019s lawless orders and regulations. Indeed, if they fail to do so, then they violate their own oaths \u201cto Support and Defend\u201d our Constitution, and Rule of Law becomes gravely imperiled by rule of men.\n\nOf course, if Republicans don\u2019t act, and we continue racing down this imperialist path to tyranny, there are tens of millions of American Patriots who understand our options.\n\nHaving recently celebrated Independence Day, I invite you to re-read the Declaration of Independence. This remarkable treatise on Liberty as \u201cendowed by our Creator\u201d addressed an imperial executive who willfully violated that endowment \u201cwhich the Laws of Nature and of Nature\u2019s God entitled\u201d all people.\n\nOur Founders outlined the \u201cinjuries and usurpations\u201d committed by the executive, \u201call having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States.\u201d They noted, \u201cHe has refused his Assent to Laws \u2026 He has obstructed the Administration of Justice \u2026 He has erected a multitude of New Offices, and sent hither swarms of Officers to harrass our people, and eat out their substance.\u201d\n\nThere are undeniable parallels between the imperial powers which gave rise to the American Revolution and the imperial presidency which now threatens the Liberty our Founders, and generations of American Patriots since, have defended with their \u201clives, fortunes and sacred honor.\u201d\n\nObama now jokes about his lawlessness: \u201cIt is lonely, me just doing stuff. \u2026 I\u2019m just telling the truth now. I don\u2019t have to run for office again, so I can just let her rip.\u201d\n\nIn other words, short of rigorous intervention by Congress, this gets much worse before it gets any better.\n\nPro Deo et Constitutione \u2013 Libertas aut Mors\n\nSemper Fortis Vigilate Paratus et Fidelis", "article_metadata": {"description": "Obama has launched a campaign to completely bypass Congress through executive and regulatory diktat.", "csrf-token": "rOwTE8sgNAAU3JzNhsfLPnXOWoWOT0dXXQf3Xu2CpQM=", "msapplication-TileColor": "#2b5797", "csrf-param": "authenticity_token", "og": {"site_name": "The Patriot Post", "description": "Obama has launched a campaign to completely bypass Congress through executive and regulatory diktat.", "title": "The Imperial President", "url": "http://patriotpost.us/alexander/27481", "image": "http://assets.patriotpost.us/images/2014-07-16-be0a475e.jpg", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100002378661032, "app_id": 217327155053459}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/mstile-144x144.png", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd98d0\"", "article_summary": "I\u2019m the president \u2026 If in fact I could solve all these problems without passing laws in Congress then I would do so.\nThis remarkable treatise on Liberty as \u201cendowed by our Creator\u201d addressed an imperial executive who willfully violated that endowment \u201cwhich the Laws of Nature and of Nature\u2019s God entitled\u201d all people.\nTestifying before Congress, Turley said, \u201cWhen the president went to Congress and said he would go it alone, it obviously raises a concern.\nIf the law is not what is plainly written, but is whatever the president and his agents decide, what\u2019s left of the law?\nIn this country, the president is required to win the consent of Congress first."}
