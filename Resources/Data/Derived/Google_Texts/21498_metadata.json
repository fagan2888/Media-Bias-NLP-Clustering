Recent headlines like this one in The Financial Times might have given you more reason to hold off:\n\nNot so fast, says FICO, the most widely used credit score.\n\nWhat it and others in the industry are doing instead is looking at alternative data, such as phone and utility bills and property and other public records, in addition to the traditional sources used to determine a credit score, like credit card, mortgage and auto loan payments.\n\nRelated: Why Your Credit Score Is the Most Important Number in Your Life\n\nThat shouldn\u2019t scare consumers. In fact, they\u2019re being developed so more people with thin credit histories, such as young adults and recent immigrants, can have a traditional credit score and qualify for loans.\n\nRoughly 53 million Americans don\u2019t have enough payment information in their credit bureau files for FICO to calculate a credit score, said FICO spokeswoman Christina Goethe. But in a pilot program of its new method \u2014 dubbed FICO Score XD \u2014 millions of these consumers obtained at least a 620 score, which is high enough to qualify for many loans.\n\n\u201cFICO Score XD can be a lifeline for millions of previously unscoreable people,\u201d Goethe said in an email. \u201cA majority go on to maintain good credit and achieve high traditional FICO scores.\u201d\n\nIndividuals who receive high scores regularly paid phone and utility bills and hadn\u2019t given any indications of problems paying rent.\n\nAs much as alternative data can help, it also comes with a catch. \u201cIf the applicant looks more risky with alternative data then he or she may be denied or receive a higher rate as part of the offer. Considering new data isn\u2019t always about awarding consumers with higher scores. It\u2019s about a more accurate assessment, for better or worse,\u201d credit expert John Ulzheimer, who used to work for FICO and Equifax, said in an email.\n\nRelated: Here\u2019s Why Millennials Have the Lowest Credit Scores\n\nBut even if FICO isn\u2019t using social media data now, that doesn\u2019t mean it won\u2019t in the future. \u201cIf you look at how many times a person says \u2018wasted\u2019 in their profile, it has some value in predicting whether they\u2019re going to repay their debt,\u201d FICO CEO Will Lansing told the Financial Times in a report last week.\n\nTransUnion, one of the three main credit reporting companies, also is expanding its use of certain data \u2014 but not from social media \u2014 to help people with slim records get loans. Its CreditVision score includes more historical payment information along with payment amounts in its calculations. A study by the company in March found the new method scored an additional 26.5 million people who could not be scored before.\n\nCredit reporting agency Experian found in a study earlier this year that the number of consumers with subprime credit scores dropped by 20 percent when rental payments were included in the credit scores.\n\nThese new procedures are in response to concerns from banks that by turning down people without a traditional credit score, they\u2019re rejecting potential sources of profit. Banks are searching for new sources of revenue as low interest rates and reduced demand are hurting their revenue and profits.\n\nRelated: More Americans Get Free Credit Scores. Now What?\n\nWhile alternative data is a useful way to help those with a thin credit score, banks aren\u2019t convinced it\u2019s better than the traditional method and will most likely use it as a supplement. \u201cBanks would rather make decisions using a garden variety credit report with a score,\u201d Ulzheimer said in an email.\n\nIt still might not be the best idea to post about a crazy night on Facebook, but you can rest easy knowing that if you do, your credit score won\u2019t be affected \u2014 yet.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "You already know to think twice before posting pictures and stories about your wild Sa", "title": "Can Your Facebook Profile Really Hurt Your Credit Score?", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/10/27/Can-Your-Facebook-Profile-Really-Hurt-Your-Credit-Score", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/ozatp-us-facebook-africa_2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/10/27/Can-Your-Facebook-Profile-Really-Hurt-Your-Credit-Score", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/ozatp-us-facebook-africa_2.jpg", "creator": "@milliedent", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "You already know to think twice before posting pictures and stories about your wild Sa", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcaaeb\"", "article_summary": "In fact, they\u2019re being developed so more people with thin credit histories, such as young adults and recent immigrants, can have a traditional credit score and qualify for loans.\nRoughly 53 million Americans don\u2019t have enough payment information in their credit bureau files for FICO to calculate a credit score, said FICO spokeswoman Christina Goethe.\nCredit reporting agency Experian found in a study earlier this year that the number of consumers with subprime credit scores dropped by 20 percent when rental payments were included in the credit scores.\nRelated: Why Your Credit Score Is the Most Important Number in Your LifeThat shouldn\u2019t scare consumers.\n\u201cFICO Score XD can be a lifeline for millions of previously unscoreable people,\u201d Goethe said in an email."}
