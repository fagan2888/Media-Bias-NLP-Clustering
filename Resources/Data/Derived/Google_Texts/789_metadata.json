The percentage of uninusured in the United States dropped down below 12 percent last year, its lowest rate in years and a five point drop since Obamacare\u2019s coverage expansion provisions kicked in, according to Gallup. And the law\u2019s health insurance exchanges, one of its two key coverage expansion mechanisms, along with its expansion of Medicaid, has played a significant role in making that happen. Enrollment in exchange coverage increased from 6.3 million at the end of 2014 to about 8.8 million, according to figures released by the administration at the end of last week.\n\nBut Obamacare\u2019s coverage gains have also been more modest than expected, particularly when it comes to the exchanges. And part of the problem seems to be that people who sign up for coverage at the beginning of the year don\u2019t always follow through to keep their coverage effective at the end of the year. It\u2019s a problem that seems to be larger than the administration knew.\n\nOverall, exchange enrollment is short of where the Congressional Budget Office initially expected it would be by roughly 7 million people. And although the 8.8 million enrolled in the exchanges at the end of 2015 is a notable step up from the 2014 numbers, it\u2019s also below expectations: The administration had targeted a figure of about 9.1 million, but came up short. And even if enrollment had come in at the administration\u2019s target, it still would have represented a significant drop off from the 11.7 million people who signed up for coverage at the beginning of the year. The point is, there was a 25 percent decline from the number of people who were signed up at the beginning of the year to the number of people fully paid and still enrolled at the end of the year.\n\nWhat\u2019s happening, basically, is that attrition is turning out to be even larger than expected. And while it\u2019s not entirely clear why, there are certainly some good indicators.\n\nAs the administration noted in its press release last week, coverage for a half a million people was terminated in 2015 because of what the administration is describing as \u201cdata matching issues\u201d\u2014essentially, their citizenship, immigration, or other personal info didn\u2019t match up with federal records. They couldn\u2019t prove they actually qualified for coverage under the law.\n\nThere are also a lot of people who appear to be signing up but never paying for coverage at all. Brian Blas\u00e9 of the Mercatus Center suggests that this accounts for about half of the decline. Blase also points to a New York Times report from late last year suggesting that many people don\u2019t find their coverage all that valuable once they try to use it. In addition, as Jed Graham points out in Investor\u2019s Business Daily, the enrollment data released last week suggests that the law is placing burdens on middle and working class Americans, sometimes forcing them to choose between buying coverage that isn\u2019t helpful and paying a penalty to remain uninsured.\n\nThese disappointments go a long way toward explaining the persistent negative-tilt to public opinion about the law, and why even its most ardent defender in the presidential race, Hillary Clinton, has consistently said the law needs to be fixed and improved upon, particularly when it comes to personal expenditures.\n\nIn the sense that it has improved coverage rates, then, Obamacare may be a success, though a more modest one than many had hoped. But to a lot of people, it clearly doesn\u2019t feel that way.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "Health law exchanges face 25 percent attrition rate in 2015.", "title": "Obamacare\u2019s Weak Enrollment Numbers", "url": "http://reason.com/blog/2016/03/17/obamacares-weak-enrollment-numbers", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14582410651339.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Health law exchanges face 25 percent attrition rate in 2015.", "creator": "@petersuderman", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14582410651339.jpg", "title": "Obamacare\u2019s Weak Enrollment Numbers", "site": "@reason", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 17548474116}, "google-site-verification": "-AmMiilAN-pnjWt369CUWae-VQ-b9wmH4fSGyhbkQxw", "msvalidate.01": "212A68A07785B3080038A845C4EE8905", "article": {"tag": "Policy", "published_time": "2016-03-17T20:03:00+00:00", "author": "http://reason.com/people/peter-suderman"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2"}, "article_summary": "Overall, exchange enrollment is short of where the Congressional Budget Office initially expected it would be by roughly 7 million people.\nBut Obamacare\u2019s coverage gains have also been more modest than expected, particularly when it comes to the exchanges.\nAnd the law\u2019s health insurance exchanges, one of its two key coverage expansion mechanisms, along with its expansion of Medicaid, has played a significant role in making that happen.\nEnrollment in exchange coverage increased from 6.3 million at the end of 2014 to about 8.8 million, according to figures released by the administration at the end of last week.\nThe percentage of uninusured in the United States dropped down below 12 percent last year, its lowest rate in years and a five point drop since Obamacare\u2019s coverage expansion provisions kicked in, according to Gallup."}
