Though Maine is known for its largely moderate stances, Gov. LePage\u2019s far-right views and approach to leading isn\u2019t just upsetting Democrats \u2013 it\u2019s also concerning plenty of Republicans.\n\nAs a result of his inappropriate comments and disgraceful behavior, state legislators are currently discussing whether to pursue impeachment. Convincing enough Republicans to abandon faith in LePage in order to secure an impeachment might be a long shot, but there are plenty of reasons why Maine deserves a better governor:\n\n1. He\u2019s racist\n\nMost recently, LePage made headlines for going on a bigoted rant, blaming Maine\u2019s growing drug problem on out-of-state black men. \u201cThese are guys with the name D-Money, Smoothie, Shifty \u2013 these types of guys \u2013 they come from Connecticut and New York, they come up here, they sell their heroin, they go back home. Incidentally, half the time they impregnate a young white girl before they leave, which is the real sad thing,\u201d he said.\n\nDespite his comments dripping with coded racism, LePage insists he intended no racial connotations with his comments. That might be slightly more believable if he hadn\u2019t previously declined an invitation to a NAACP event with an invitation of his own for the organization to \u201ckiss [his] butt.\u201d On another occasion, LePage was reported to declare that President Barack Obama \u201chates white people.\u201d\n\n2. He\u2019s sexist, too\n\nWhen activists pushed for publicly funded elections in the state, LePage shuddered at the thought, saying that it would cost taxpayers too much money. \u201cThat\u2019s like\u2026 giving your wife your checkbook. Go spend!\u201d he said.\n\nLePage\u2019s sexist stereotype is an embarrassing way to put down clean elections, particularly when it is spending in non-publicly funded elections that tends to get out of control. While it\u2019s not clear whether LePage is aware of the statistics that show that women are more likely to run for office and win when public financing is available, his stance against the proposal could be at least as harmful as his reasoning.\n\n3. He\u2019s ridiculously anti-labor\n\nLePage caused a big stink when he decided to remove a popular mural that portrayed a history of Maine\u2019s labor struggles in the Department of Labor. The mural featured specific strikes, women shipbuilders, fights to reduce work hours and increase safety, and the end of child labor. Vocally anti-union, LePage explained that the mural was too \u201cone-sided\u201d and wasn\u2019t fair to businesses.\n\nSadly, getting rid of the mural wasn\u2019t just a symbolic gesture \u2013 he\u2019s also tried to pass legislation that counters the labor advancements depicted in the mural\u2026 including weakening child labor laws. LePage advocates dropping the legal labor age to 12, adding that these minors should also receive sub-minimum wage payment for this work.\n\n4. He stands accused of blackmail\n\nAllegedly, LePage took revenge on his political rival Mark Eves, the Democratic House Speaker of Maine, this past year by getting him removed from Good Will-Hinckley, the charter school organization he headed. According to a lawsuit, LePage told Good Will-Hinckley that he would withdraw all state funding allotted to the non-profit if it didn\u2019t sack Eves, leaving the schools with no choice but to dump the politician. Though the lawsuit is still pending, LePage says he\u2019ll claim immunity in court.\n\n5. He limited citizens\u2019 health care options\n\nWhile campaigning in the 2014 governor race, LePage committed himself to \u201cfind[ing] a way\u201d to cover his state\u2019s uninsured population. However, anyone paying attention would have known how disingenuous this claim was, given how he blatantly vetoed Medicaid expansion legislation that would have taken care of these people \u2013 all at no cost to the state.\n\nWhy would he do that? Simply put, the funds came from Obamacare, something LePage stubbornly refused to accept. Claiming you want to help people while denying the money that would secure insurance coverage for these people out of spite is no way to be a leader.\n\n6. He unsuccessfully rage-vetoed a lot of legislation while trying to eliminate income tax\n\nAfter referring to the IRS as the \u201cnew Gestapo,\u201d LePage went on a tear last year insisting that Maine legislators adopt his plan to eliminate the state income tax altogether. Not paying taxes sounds nice, but since half of the state\u2019s revenue comes from income tax, Maine would be in a lot of trouble without this money. When Democrats refused to sign off on this amendment, the governor threatened to retaliate by vetoing every single Democratic bill until they agreed to his plan.\n\nLest you think that\u2019s all a bit of bluster, LePage actually vetoed 65 bills passed by Maine\u2019s Congress in an act of retaliation\u2026 or at least he tried to. Apparently, the governor misunderstood the timetable for vetoing the legislation and missed the deadline. He insisted that his tardy vetoes should stand, but the Supreme Court ultimately disagreed, so all of the bills wound up becoming law anyway. I don\u2019t know whether it\u2019s worse that he broadly vetoed so many bills out of spite, or that he was too incompetent to even follow through on that threat correctly, but neither scenario seems to make him a good governor.\n\nIf you support the effort to see Governor Paul LePage impeached, you can sign the petition here.\n\nPhoto Credit: Matt Gagnon", "article_metadata": {"description": "The hotheaded governor has given state Democrats plenty of reasons to pursue impeachment.", "og": {"image": "http://dingo.care2.com/pictures/causes/3165/3164887.large.jpg"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "p": {"domain_verify": "34d24671362965e0c3942e7b3b484ea7"}, "fb": {"app_id": 83187307959}, "keywords": "impeachment,paul lepage,maine,politics,governor,racism,blackmail,taxes,labor,health care", "viewport": "width=device-width,user-scalable=no,initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "In an era known for over-the-top political antics, somehow Maine\u2019s Governor Paul LePage is proving to be one of the nation\u2019s most hotheaded politicians.\nIf you support the effort to see Governor Paul LePage impeached, you can sign the petition here.\nConvincing enough Republicans to abandon faith in LePage in order to secure an impeachment might be a long shot, but there are plenty of reasons why Maine deserves a better governor:1.\nHe\u2019s sexist, tooWhen activists pushed for publicly funded elections in the state, LePage shuddered at the thought, saying that it would cost taxpayers too much money.\nHe\u2019s racistMost recently, LePage made headlines for going on a bigoted rant, blaming Maine\u2019s growing drug problem on out-of-state black men."}
