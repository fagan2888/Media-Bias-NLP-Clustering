Amid an overhaul of New York\u2019s teacher evaluation system, and the controversy of using standardizing testing as a key metric, many are questioning what measures should be used to judge teachers. (Photo: Joe Larese/The Journal News)Buy Photo\n\nGov. Andrew Cuomo said a curious thing recently, that the state's standardized tests in math and ELA are \"meaningless\" for students. He couldn't figure out why tens of thousands of parents refused to let their kids take the tests.\n\nOne reason that the tests are meaningful is that they are being used in a state formula to grade teachers and principals. This evaluation system was poorly conceived and is widely disliked by educators for its simplistic, unrevealing and punitive nature.\n\nDeclining morale in neighborhood schools is one big reason that many parents boycotted the state tests. How can Cuomo not see the connection?\n\nTake a stand\n\nNow our leaders are racing to fix the system, but are likely to make it worse. Cuomo and legislative leaders, as part of their budget agreement, gave the state Board of Regents until June 30 to re-create the evaluation system, setting strict rules that tie the Regents' hands.\n\nStop it. It's time for the Board of Regents to take a stand \u2013 and stand up to Cuomo. The board should declare that it can't slap together a viable evaluation system. New York should keep its current system in place and use at least the rest of 2015 to design a system that would promote classroom instruction and hold teachers accoutable.\n\nJudith Johnson, the Lower Hudson Valley's new representative on the Board of Regents, has the right idea. \"What the governor has put in place makes no sense,\" she said. \"If you want a scholarly system, you can't throw it together in 30 to 60 days. If we ignore the science behind teacher evaluations, it's just a political decision.\"\n\nWe spoke to 11 local educators and others with a stake in what's happening and no one could see how a viable system can be drawn up by June 30. \"We have to get a delay and change it \u2013 and not let the governor do this to us,\" Valhalla Superintendent Brenda Myers said.\n\nMyers: Legislation 'changes the definition of quality teaching and learning'\n\nSkip Ad Ad Loading... x Embed x Share Valhalla Schools Superintendent Brenda Myers discusses New York's teacher evaluation system.

Assemblywoman Amy Paulin, D-Scarsdale, said that legislators might act if the Regents offer a new vision.\n\n\"We would need the Regents to use the energy (of the opt-out movement),\" she said. \"Declare this system to be ineffective and figure out how we can do it better.\"\n\nWay too narrow\n\nAs of now, the Regents are required to devise a system that would grade teachers on only two measures: how their students grow on tests; and at least two classroom observations. And that's it. This absurdly narrow system would not measure most elements of teacher quality or give districts enough information to improve instruction. School districts would be prohibited from considering other evidence of student development, like portfolios of student work, student and parent surveys, or ongoing classroom observations.\n\nThis is nuts.\n\nSchool administrators fear that the emphasis on tests will inflame a test-prep mentality. Some teachers are already talking openly about finding ways to reduce the concentration of potentially poor test-takers in the classes \u2013 including students with disabilities and English-language learners.\n\n\"You're reducing teaching to gaming the test,\" said Harry Leonardatos, principal of Clarkstown High School North.\n\nEducators and parents remain unconvinced that the state's new, Pearson-created math and ELA tests are valid, reliable assessments. A reboot of the evaluation system would have to acknowledge this fundamental concern. \"How can it be that no one has assessed the assessments?\" said Susan Elion Wollin, president of the Westchester Putnam School Boards Assocation.\n\nWollin: 'Any parent ... knows each of her children learns differently'\n\nSkip Ad Ad Loading... x Embed x Share Susan Elion Wollin, a Bedford schools trustee and president of the Westchester Putnam School Boards Association, discusses New York's teacher evaluation system. Video by Ricky Flores / The Journal News\n\nA key issue completely lost in the evaluation debate: Only a quarter of teachers have students who take the math and ELA tests. The majority of teachers are judged by how their students progress on a hodgepodge of state, third-party and locally created tests, which vary in quality and produce little meaningful information. It's time to review these results.\n\nHow many classroom observations are enough to grade a teacher? More than two scheduled \"dog-and-pony shows.\" Let's review how observations are done best.\n\nParent involvement\n\nAs of now, the Regents will hold a single hearing in Albany, on Thursday. Dozens of experts will offer opinions that neither the Regents nor their overworked staff in the state Education Department could possibly have time to seriously consider before their June 30 deadline.\n\nThen school districts have until September to figure out how to implement the new system through collective bargaining with unions. They could lose state aid if they don't make the deadline, an incentive to produce crummy work that the Regents should denounce.\n\nThe Regents should call on the Legislature to freeze the current system and appoint a group of educators and evaluation experts to recommend the best possible system or, better yet, several models. And talk about setting aside time to pilot them.\n\nHarrison Superintendent Lou Wool, who has pleaded with legislators and Cuomo's staff to put education before politics, said that parents who boycotted the state tests could focus their frustration by demanding a new evaluation system. \"It's simple,\" he said. \"Amend these policies now.\"\n\nWool: 'Testing, tenure and teaching have all been damaged'\n\nSkip Ad Ad Loading... x Embed x Share Harrison Schools Superintendent Louis Wool New York's teacher evaluation system.
