EPA/JIM LO SCALZO\n\nTHE BIG IDEA:\n\n\u2014 Before its term ends next week, the Supreme Court appears very likely to recognize a Constitutional right to gay marriage in Obergefell v. Hodges. Such a landmark ruling, which could be announced as early as today or Thursday, would end the bans still in effect across more than a dozen states, from Ohio and Michigan to Kentucky and Tennessee.\n\n\u2014 Long term, this should take the marriage issue off the political table. GOP leaders in Washington overwhelmingly \u2013 but mostly privately \u2013 support gay rights. They\u2019re eager for the chance to say that the Court has spoken and the subject is settled, even as they publicly express disagreement.\n\n\u2014 Short term, the Court\u2019s expected ruling will put gay marriage front and center in the 2016 GOP primary. With a field of almost 20 candidates, the undercards are looking for every opportunity to stand out. Though attitudes have shifted rapidly, social conservatives who oppose same-sex unions retain the power to decide who wins Iowa\u2019s caucuses and South Carolina\u2019s primary. The National Organization for Marriage is determined to make support for a Constitutional amendment overturning the SCOTUS decision a litmus test. Last week, it began publicly prodding 2016 candidates to sign a pledge that they will do everything possible to \u201coverturn\u201d an \u201cillegitimate\u201d decision.\n\nAlmost all of the 2012 candidates signed the NOM \u201cmarriage pledge,\u201d including Mitt Romney. But the atmosphere has changed substantially. The donor class is more powerful than ever because of Citizens United, and most major donors either back same-sex marriage or feel pretty agnostic about social issues. The most credible candidates also worry about turning off independents and younger voters in a general election: a CNN poll last month found that 63 percent of Americans believe gays and lesbians have a Constitutional right to marry. This will incline contenders like Jeb Bush, Chris Christie and John Kasich to say that they respect the rule of law, despite whatever their personal beliefs may be. On the other side, Ted Cruz introduced a constitutional amendment in April that would let states re-ban gay marriage. Bobby Jindal supports such an amendment; Scott Walker suggested openness to considering such an approach, but he\u2019s also said the courts settled the issue in his home state of Wisconsin.\n\nMike Huckabee and Rick Santorum, the previous two winners of the Iowa caucuses, will try to use the ruling to jump start their afterthought campaigns. The former Arkansas governor sent a letter late last week to more than 100 activists pledging to fight an adverse decision, saying he refuses \u201cto surrender to the false god of judicial supremacy.\u201d The former Pennsylvania senator, meanwhile, likens the fight over gay rights to the fight over abortion. \u201cRoe vs. Wade was decided 30 some years ago, and I continue to fight that, because I think the court got it wrong,\u201d he said recently.\n\n\u2014 Why everyone thinks the Court will endorse same-sex marriages: Anthony Kennedy. \u201cJustice Kennedy now has a gay clerk, Joshua Matz, who wrote a 2012 law review article with [Harvard law professor Laurence] Tribe titled \u2018The Constitutional Inevitability of Same-Sex Marriage,\u2019\u201d a story on the front page of today\u2019s New York Times notes. The piece explores how Kennedy, the swing vote in these cases, \u201cemerged as an unlikely gay rights icon.\u201d Essentially, it is \u201chis views on privacy and liberty, his belief in marriage as a stabilizing force, his concern for the children of same-sex couples and his custom \u2014 in the words of one good friend, Judge Alex Kozinski of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit \u2014 of \u2018stepping into the skin\u2019 of those his decisions affect.\u201d\n\n\u2014 The fight over \u201creligious liberty\u201d will escalate in the aftermath of the decision. \u201cTexas Republican Gov. Greg Abbott recently signed a \u2018pastor protection\u2019 law that allows clergy members to refuse officiating marriages that violates his religious beliefs,\u201d the AP reports. \u201cLeaders of the Southern Baptist Convention, meeting [this past] Wednesday in Columbus, issued a statement saying they would not recognize, host or perform same-sex marriages. Some county clerks in Kentucky and other states, including Nebraska, have expressed objections to the possibility of same-sex marriages\u2026North Carolina and Utah have passed laws allowing some court officials to refuse to perform gay marriage responsibilities.\u201d\n\nWHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING:\n\n\u2014 Ted Cruz\u2019s campaign said it will return all the money it received from a racist cited in Charleston murderer Dylann Roof\u2019s manifesto. \u201cEarl Holt has given $65,000 to Republican campaign funds in recent years while inflammatory remarks \u2013 including that black people were \u2018the laziest, stupidest and most criminally-inclined race in the history of the world\u2019 \u2013 were posted online in his name,\u201d according to the Guardian. \u201cAfter being approached by the Guardian on Sunday, Cruz\u2019s presidential campaign said it would be returning all money the senator had received from Holt. Holt, 62, is the president of the Council of Conservative Citizens (CofCC), a Missouri-based activist organisation cited by the author of a manifesto-style text that was posted on a website registered in Roof\u2019s name along with photographs of the gunman \u2026 Holt has since 2012 contributed $8,500 to Cruz \u2026 He has also given $1,750 to RandPAC \u2026 and he gave $2,000 to the 2012 presidential campaign of Mitt Romney. A further $1,500 was donated by Holt to Santorum.\u201d\n\n\u2014 The Taliban attacked the Afghan parliament as it was meeting to endorse a new defense minister, forcing frightened lawmakers to flee the building. After a two-hour firefight, six gunmen were reportedly killed.\n\n\u2014 The missing former White House chef was found dead in the New Mexico mountains. \u201cWalter Scheib, the 61-year-old \u2026 who had been missing in New Mexico\u2019s rugged Sangre de Cristo Mountains for more than a week, was discovered dead late Sunday night by a search and rescue crew. Scheib\u2019s body was found nearly two miles from the Yerba Canyon Trail head in Taos, N.M., a town some 70 miles from Santa Fe.\u201d\n\n\u2014 A possible sighting of the two New York murderers who escaped from prison prompted a big shift in the focus of the manhunt overnight. \u201cInvestigators and military trucks converged on Mountain View, a hamlet in Franklin County, late Sunday,\u201d the AP reports. \u201cJust hours before hundreds had searched two towns more than 350 miles away, following an unconfirmed but credible report of another sighting.\u201d\n\nGET SMART FAST:\n\nThe Senate will take a standalone vote on Trade Promotion Authority on Tuesday. Obama needs to keep at least 11 of the 14 Democrats who voted for his plan last month, but this time it won\u2019t have Trade Adjustment Assistance. There\u2019s a promise that will come in a separate bill later. Three-quarters of Republicans said they could support Jeb Bush in a new NBC/WSJ poll, up from 70 percent in April and 49 percent in March. Per the Journal story, which posted at midnight, Bush leads with 22 percent of Republican voters. Walker is at 17 percent; Rubio is at 14 percent; and Ben Carson is fourth, with 11 percent support. Thousands of people held hands to form a human chain across the Arthur Ravenel Jr. Bridge in Charleston, one of several touching memorials in the Holy City yesterday. \u201cA key Army commander in the U.S. war against the Islamic State has been reprimanded by the Pentagon for steering a defense contract to a firm run by two of his former classmates at West Point.\u201d (Craig Whitlock) The wife of Israeli Interior Minister Silvan Shalom apologized for tweeting a racist joke about President Obama.\n\nWAPO HIGHLIGHTS:\n\n\u2014 \u201cObama\u2019s ancestral homeland in Kenya had lots of hope, but got little change,\u201d by Kevin Sieff in Kenya: \u201cNext month, Obama will make his first trip to Kenya as president. If he returns to Kogelo, he\u2019ll find a village lifted by its association with the world\u2019s most powerful man but still wrestling with disease and poverty. He\u2019ll find people proud enough to name their boys Barack Obama but disappointed that he waited until the seventh year of his presidency to return to his father\u2019s homeland.\u201d\n\n\u2014 \u201cThe race is on for the Latino vote,\u201d by Mary Jordan, on the ground in Nevada: \u201cMany people interviewed said they had never heard of Marco Rubio \u2026 There is speculation about whether [Jeb] Bush will ask [Nevada Gov. Brian] Sandoval, the popular governor, to be his running mate \u2026 Many Latinos interviewed said they were disappointed with Obama for not fulfilling promises to do more and are fed up with all politicians. Last November, they stayed home, and exceedingly low Latino turnout has been widely seen as helping Republicans in Nevada take control of the legislature for the first time in nearly a century, win statewide offices, and knock off a Democratic House member in what was considered a very safe district.\u201d\n\nSOCIAL MEDIA SPEED READ:\n\n\u2014 ZIGNAL VISUAL: TV producers showed more restraint in covering Donald Trump last week than regular people on social media. Zignal Labs, The Post\u2019s campaign analytics partner, is tracking mentions of the 2016 White House contenders across a variety of media platforms, from traditional to broadcast to social. And a look at how the nascent presidential race is playing in different media reveals something about the content of those stories and how each medium is distinct. The week from June 12-19 was a busy one in the presidential race. It began with Hillary Clinton\u2019s first official campaign event on Roosevelt Island. That was followed by Jeb Bush\u2019s formal declaration of his candidacy. And then there was the media atomic bomb that was the Trump announcement. For the week, Trump dominated the news: 41 percent of all the conversation about 2016 was about Trump, across broadcast, blogs, online and social media. Clinton received 19 percent of the mentions, followed by 15 percent for Bush and 7 percent for Bernie Sanders.\n\nBut look what happens to our chart if we only examine television mentions. Clinton and Trump each got exactly 15 percent of all mentions related to 2016, with Bush basically tied at 14 percent. While there is much focus, and justifiably so, for how social media impacts presidential campaigning, TV is still the king of all media. And looking at how TV covers the 2016 campaign reveals different insights into who is being talked about, and what is being said about them.\n\n\u2013WHAT EVERYONE IS TALKING ABOUT:\n\nPictures of the day, Father\u2019s Day edition:\n\n\n\nThinking today and every day about the father of these two.

Committee staffers said they worked with MIT to obtain the 20,000 pages of emails \u2026 The emails show frequent consultations between Mr. Gruber and top Obama administration staffers and advisers in the White House and the Department of Health and Human Services on the Affordable Care Act. They show he informed HHS about interviews with reporters and discussions with lawmakers, and he consulted with HHS about how to publicly describe his role. \u2018Thank you for being an integral part of getting us to this historic moment,\u2019 according to Sept. 9, 2009 email to Mr. Gruber from Jeanne Lambrew, a top Obama administration health adviser who worked at HHS and the White House. In a November 2009 email, she called Mr. Gruber \u2018our hero.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u2014 Newark Star-Ledger, \u201cToricelli, a decade later, wants back into the Big Game,\u201d by Tom Moran: \u201cBob Torricelli has a hole in his soul, and he doesn\u2019t hide it. He misses being a United States Senator, and he still winces when he remembers the day he dropped out of his re-election campaign in 2002 after being \u2018severely admonished\u2019 by his fellow senators on ethics charges \u2026 Torch, as he is known, wants back in to the political game. He has nailed it as a real estate developer over the last decade, building a fortune that friends put at more than $30 million \u2026 The only real possibility is a return to the U.S. Senate. He says he doesn\u2019t want to run for governor, and would seek only statewide office. But Torricelli can\u2019t connect those dots without giving offense. Because the only plausible way a Senate seat could open before 2018 is for Sen. Robert Menendez, who faces trial on corruption charges in October, to be convicted and removed from office.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Quad-City Times, \u201cActivists rally for Biden in Davenport, Iowa,\u201d by Ed Tibbetts: \u201cAbout three dozen people rallied on Davenport\u2019s riverfront Saturday, showing their support for Vice President Joe Biden, with many hoping that he\u2019ll jump into the 2016 presidential race. Leaders of the Draft Biden 2016 effort said here Saturday they are seeing a groundswell of support from across the country. Will Pierce, the group\u2019s executive director, said 81,000 signatures of support have been gathered so far, and he expects that number to grow significantly because of a recent solicitation. He added the draft group has hired state directors in Iowa and New Hampshire, and it plans to hold other rallies like the one Saturday in Davenport.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Boston Globe, \u201cSenator Rubio falls silent on immigration, his signature subject,\u201d by Matt Viser: \u201cDuring 2013, he mentioned \u2018immigration\u2019 or \u2018immigrant\u2019 135 times on the Senate floor. But over the last two years, he\u2019s only uttered those words two times, according to a Globe review of the Congressional Record. Over those first six months of 2013, his office sent out nearly 150 press releases on immigration. Since then, he has issued just three press releases on the subject. And on the campaign trail, the subject rarely comes up unprompted.\u201d\n\n\u2014 BuzzFeed, \u201cOne of South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham\u2019s longtime advisers was the editor-in-chief of a neo-Confederate magazine \u2014 a magazine Graham gave an interview to in 1999,\u201d by Andrew Kaczynski and Ilan Ben-Meir: \u201cRichard Quinn has been quoted in the press as South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham\u2019s longtime political adviser and his consultant and pollster. But there\u2019s another title that Quinn once held: neo-Confederate magazine editor. From early 1980s until the early 2000s, Quinn\u2019s name stood on the masthead as the editor-in-chief of the Southern Partisan, formerly one of the country\u2019s leading neo-Confederate magazines (it still exists in a barebones online version). Quinn has tried to distance himself from the magazine in the past (he says he doesn\u2019t like the term neo-Confederate), and after being contacted by BuzzFeed News, repudiated his past views and those of the magazine.\u201d\n\nBUZZING AT THE CAPITOL:\n\n\u2014 Politico, \u201cJason Chaffetz strips Meadows of subcommittee chairmanship,\u201d by Jake Sherman and Lauren French: \u201cHouse Oversight and Government Reform Chairman Jason Chaffetz has stripped North Carolina Rep. Mark Meadows of his subcommittee chairmanship, just days after he defied leadership on the House floor by voting against a party-line procedural motion \u2026 Losing a subcommittee chairmanship midway through a congressional session is among the most serious punishments thus far in Speaker John Boehner\u2019s (R-Ohio) majority.\u201d\n\n\u2014 The Hill, \u201cWashington whipped into frenzy ahead of Obamacare ruling,\u201d by Sarah Ferris: \u201cThe wait is almost over for what could be the last big legal threat to ObamaCare \u2026 While Sylvia Burwell\u2019s department has given no official guidance to the three-dozen states that could lose their subsidies, the administration is starting to show its hand. [Last] week, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) gave permission for two states to move ahead with backup plans to save their subsidies, which would involve launching their own ObamaCare marketplaces.\u201d\n\n\u2014 National Journal, \u201cBetween the House and Senate, a nuclear weapons gap,\u201d by Fawn Johnson: \u201cThe Senate\u2019s biggest defense hawk isn\u2019t pushing as hard as his House counterparts are for more robust nuclear development and missile defense \u2026 It\u2019s just that this isn\u2019t [Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman John] McCain\u2019s fight.
