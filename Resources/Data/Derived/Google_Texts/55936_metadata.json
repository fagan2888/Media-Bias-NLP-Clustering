Contrary to what people believe, Ingraham insisted, policy on the border between the United States and Mexico was characterized by the \u201cwillful refusal to enforce laws, across the board, evenly, as they are supposed to be enforced.\u201d\n\nIngraham then transitioned to a criticism of Rep. Paul Ryan, who recently enraged many members of the anti-reform right by voicing his support for eventually granting legal status to undocumented immigrants.\n\n\u201cIt was fun to hear from Paul Ryan, I think it was yesterday, when he was talking about another mandate being delayed in Obamacare, and he\u2019s huffing and puffing about that,\u201d Ingraham said. \u201cWell, what do you think was gonna happen with immigration, Paul? What do you think the administration was going to do with all your new enforcement mechanisms?\u201d\n\nIngraham went on to derisively mimic Ryan, listing all of the \u201cenforcement mechanisms\u201d the Republican congressman had promised would be part of a new round of immigration reform. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be different this time,\u201d she said, pretending to be Ryan.", "article_metadata": {"description": "\"They are abusers!\" Ingraham says of the Obama administration VIDEO", "title": "Laura Ingraham says Barack Obama\u2019s treatment of the Constitution is \u201clike spousal abuse\u201d", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "\"They are abusers!\" Ingraham says of the Obama administration VIDEO", "title": "Laura Ingraham says Barack Obama\u2019s treatment of the Constitution is \u201clike spousal abuse\u201d", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/02/12/laura_ingraham_says_barack_obamas_treatment_of_the_constitution_is_like_spousal_abuse/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/08/laura_ingraham.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "\"They are abusers!\" Ingraham says of the Obama administration VIDEO", "title": "Laura Ingraham says Barack Obama\u2019s treatment of the Constitution is \u201clike spousal abuse\u201d", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/08/laura_ingraham.jpg", "creator": "@eliasisquith", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Elias Isquith", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, constitution, Fox News, george will, Harry Reid, Illegal immigrants, Immigration, Immigration Reform, Jingoism, Media Matters, Nancy Pelosi, Paul Ryan, The Laura Ingraham Show, Undocumented immigrants, Video", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcde2c\"", "article_summary": "Returning to one of her favorite talking points, Ingraham expressed skepticism about the Obama administration\u2019s claims to be deporting people in record numbers.\n\u201cWell, what do you think was gonna happen with immigration, Paul?\n\u201cIt was fun to hear from Paul Ryan, I think it was yesterday, when he was talking about another mandate being delayed in Obamacare, and he\u2019s huffing and puffing about that,\u201d Ingraham said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be different this time,\u201d she said, pretending to be Ryan.\nWhat do you think the administration was going to do with all your new enforcement mechanisms?\u201dIngraham went on to derisively mimic Ryan, listing all of the \u201cenforcement mechanisms\u201d the Republican congressman had promised would be part of a new round of immigration reform."}
