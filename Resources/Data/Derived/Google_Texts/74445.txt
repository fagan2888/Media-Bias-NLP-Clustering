Ancient remedies can be used to cure common ailments even today, here are some to keep handy for everything from a cold to irritated skin.

Colds and Flu

Hot peppers will help you breathe easier. Slippery elm bark and honey prepared as a tea is good for coughs and sore throat. Garlic in many forms is a major player. Ancient people did not have chicken soup at the ready, perhaps wild turkey, but they have it now and it contains high amounts of niacin and iron. The roots of snakeroot are revered west of the Rockies for their relief of colds and coughs.

Perhaps the best remedy for colds and flu is vitamin C. It is in so many foods, rose hips for example, but with various percentages. Cranberries have many medicinal qualities, which use this high vitamin C carrier.

Urinary Tract

Juniper berries as a tonic to disinfect the urinary tract was used with great care. Today, cranberry juice is used and recommended for kidney issues as well. Watercress is a good food for urinary problems and also helps indigestion. Dandelion root is another helpful plant for many complaints here. Asparagus, a newcomer to Native pharmacopeia is also finding its place as a blood purifier.

Lungs & Respiratory

Mullein leaves have many medicinal uses, yet one of the major ones is smoking the dried leaves. This was done to help with lung problems. The leaves were also steeped in boiled water and then the steam inhaled for sore throat or asthma.
