There were varying degrees of optimism that Washington Redskins wide receiver DeSean Jackson would be available for Sunday’s game against the New York Jets.

Coach Jay Gruden was measured in his tone, saying the wide receiver “felt OK” after he was limited in Friday’s walkthrough and that he would be a game-time decision.

The Redskins (2-3) do not have to wait until then. On Saturday afternoon, Jackson was downgraded from questionable to out, leaving the team short six starters against the Jets (3-1). Left tackle Trent Williams, center Kory Lichtensteiger, tight end Jordan Reed and cornerbacks DeAngelo Hall and Chris Culliver are all out.

Gruden said on Wednesday it was important that Jackson fully recovers from the left hamstring tear he sustained in the season opener before he returns to the field.

On Friday, offensive coordinator Sean McVay seemed slightly more optimistic that Jackson would be ready to go.

“I think a guy like that that draws that type of attention, you obviously always want him to be 100 percent,” McVay said. “I definitely think just his presence out there alone has defensive guys pay a little bit more attention because of the things he’s been able to do over the course of his career with regards to those big plays.”

Now, the Redskins will have to wait at least another week for those big plays. Jackson was limited in all three practice sessions this week.

The Redskins host the Tampa Bay Buccaneers next Sunday before entering the bye week. Gruden already said it is possible that Lichtensteiger, who has a broken thumb and left shoulder injury, could be out until after the break. It seems Jackson could be ticketed for a similar timetable.
