But they may also deserve credit if publishers, ad brokers and other online services start to see more traction in their mobile businesses, industry executives say.\n\nAccording to estimates from eMarketer, Google attracted nearly 37% of all U.S. mobile ad spending in 2014, the majority of which came from search advertising. Facebook, meanwhile, attracted 18.5% of overall ad spending, and in third place was Twitter, which accounted for 3.6%.\n\nThe online giants have been a headache for publishers, making it hard for them to compete for mobile ad dollars.\n\nAnd yet, Facebook and others have done something that will help everyone: they have gotten marketers comfortable with mobile as an advertising channel.\n\n\u201cCompanies like Facebook have done a phenomenal job getting the message out about mobile\u2026 It\u2019s been awfully helpful. The relentless focus they\u2019ve put on it has made a difference,\u201d said Curt Hecht, chief global revenue officer at Weather Co., publisher of weather.com.\n\nNew York Times Chief Revenue Officer Meredith Kopit Levien, had a similar view. \u201cFacebook and Twitter \u2013 Facebook especially \u2013 deserve an enormous amount of credit for moving the market to mobile,\u201d Ms. Levien said.\n\nFacebook and Twitter have inadvertently helped publishers through their efforts in mobile video. The platforms offer auto-play in-feed video ads across their services and ad networks, which have been well-received by marketers. That\u2019s given publishers the opportunity to do the same.\n\nNews and gossip site Daily Mail says it plans in September to launch a new mobile-ad format to allow marketers to place auto-play video ads across its properties, for example.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re jumping on the video bandwagon. It\u2019s one area where demand exceeds supply,\u201d said Jon Steinberg, Daily Mail\u2019s North America chief executive.\n\nAs a result, some industry observers predict the balance of mobile ad spending is about to shift. According to eMarketer forecasts, for example, Google\u2019s share of U.S. mobile ad spending will drop from 37.9% in 2014 to 32.4% by 2017. Facebook\u2019s share, meanwhile, will dip from 18.5% to 15.1% over the same period, eMarketer said.\n\nOverall mobile ad spending is expected to grow drastically by 2017 \u2014 so both Google and Facebook are expected to see their revenues grow \u2014 but the pair will be less dominant, said eMarketer analyst Cathy Boyle.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s so much new money coming in that Facebook and Google will continue to rake in a lot of money, but we see other groups steadily gaining share,\u201d Ms. Boyle said.\n\nSome ad buyers say they would welcome that shift, too. The more advertising inventory and data the two companies control across the ecosystem, the more powerful they become, the thinking goes.\n\nRob Norman, chief digital officer at WPP\u2019s ad buying division, GroupM, said the current situation could result in an \u201coligopoly\u201d if it carries on.\n\n\u201cMy general thesis is that add Google, Twitter and Facebook, and you get a tripartite dominance of inventory, data and transactions,\u201d he said. \u201cThree companies worth half a trillion dollars now overwhelmingly dominate the space. The implications are interesting and it seems to me that there is a widening moat between this group and the [rest of the] market.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "Facebook, Google and Twitter are trouncing everyone else when it comes to selling mobile ads.
