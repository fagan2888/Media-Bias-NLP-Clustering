Something different from what they\u2019ve been getting from the president they voted for by such large margins.\n\nEvidence comes in from various polls. Voters under 30, the Millennial generation, produced numbers for Barack Obama 13 percentage points above the national average in 2008 and nine points above in 2012.\n\nBut in recent polls, Obama\u2019s approval among those under 30 has been higher than the national average by only one percentage point (Quinnipiac), two points (ABC/Washington Post) and three points (YouGov/Economist).\n\nThose differences are statistically significant. And that\u2019s politically significant, since a higher percentage of Millennials than of the general population are Hispanic or black.\n\nThe reasons for Millennials\u2019 decreased approval of Obama become clear from a Harvard Institute of Politics (IOP) poll of 18- to 29-year-olds conducted in November.\n\nThat poll shows Obama\u2019s job approval dipping to 41 percent, down from 52 percent in April 2013 and the lowest rating in any IOP survey.\n\nOne reason for the decline is Obamacare. Only 38 percent approved of Obamacare (39 percent approved of \u201cthe Affordable Care Act\u201d). Only 29 percent of those who were uninsured said they would definitely or probably enroll in the health-insurance exchanges.\n\nThose results were registered five to nine weeks after the October 1 Healthcare.gov rollout. Tech-savvy Millennials must have been astonished that the government produced a website that didn\u2019t work.\n\nThey also perceived, accurately, that Obamacare health insurance would cost them a lot. The law passed by Democrats elected in large part with Millennial votes was designed to have people under 30 subsidize the insurance premiums of those older, less healthy people over 50.\n\nThe old tend to have significant net worth, and the young \u2014 with credit-card and student-loan debt \u2014 tend to owe more than they own. Evidently, the Obama Democrats think it\u2019s progressive for the young to subsidize the working-age old.\n\nThat, after all, is the essence of Social Security, whose benefits some left-wing Democrats want to increase.\n\nBut Millennials, whose penchant for volunteering is admirably high, are not being simply selfish. The IOP survey also finds that they tend to believe, by a margin of 44 percent to 17 percent, that the quality of their health care will get worse under Obamacare.\n\nThat\u2019s speculation, of course. But it suggests a healthy skepticism about the ability of a government \u2014 a government that lied about whether you could keep your insurance and your doctor and couldn\u2019t construct a workable website \u2014 to produce a system that will improve service delivery.\n\nThat skepticism may owe something to young Americans\u2019 experience with student loans. Some 57 percent of the IOP study Millennials say that student-loan debt is a major problem for young people. The responses don\u2019t vary much by political-party identification.\n\nOnce again, the Millennials have a point. The Obama administration did not initiate government student loans, but it continues to speak of them approvingly.\n\nYet it\u2019s obvious that the vast sums that government-subsidized student loans have pumped into higher education over the past three decades have been largely captured by colleges and universities and transformed into administrative bloat.\n\nEconomics blogger Timothy Taylor notes that if you count prices in 1982\u201384 as 100, the average cost of all items in the consumer price index increased to 231 in September 2012. Energy, housing, and transportation all increased about that much.\n\nBut college and tuition fees increased to 706 \u2014 seven times the level when the government started pumping money into higher ed. Medical care increased to more than 400.\n\nSome things that young people buy increased much less \u2014 apparel (127), toys (53), and televisions (5, thanks to quality improvement).\n\nBut suddenly, in their early adult years, Millennials find themselves socked with the inflated costs of higher education and, thanks to Obamacare, those of older people\u2019s health care.\n\nIn the meantime, in the Obama new-normal economy, they aren\u2019t finding jobs \u2014 and may be giving up on looking for them.\n\nLabor-force participation among those 55 and over has held steady since 2009. But labor-force participation among those younger has been declining, as have the earnings of college graduates.\n\nThe combination of higher-education and health-care costs and the new-normal economy amount to what Walter Russell Mead calls \u201cthe war on the young.\u201d\n\nNo wonder they\u2019re unhappy with the president who promised hope and change. Maybe they\u2019re in the market for an alternative.\n\n\u2014 Michael Barone is senior political analyst for the Washington Examiner. \u00a9 2014 the Washington Examiner.
