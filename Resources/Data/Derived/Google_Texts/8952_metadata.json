Then he started exhibiting strange behaviors.\n\nHe would go to a lamp, twist the bulb and look at his fingers for a long time.\n\nShort sentences he already knew how to say, like \u201cTie my shoes,\u201d condensed to \u201cTie shoes.\u201d Soon, he quit using words altogether and would just stand there, staring at his mother.\n\nThe story will sound familiar to any parent of a child on the autism spectrum \u2014 now one in every 68 children in the United States. But Mike\u2019s sudden transformation came in 1977, and his mother was at a loss.\n\nWhen the Bradenton boy was diagnosed with autism, one in 10,000 children were identified with some form of the disorder that affects the brain\u2019s normal development of social and communication skills in the first three years of life.\n\nEven four decades years later, talking about it makes Judy Schwanz tearful.\n\n\u201cI slowly watched him die before my eyes,\u201d she says.\n\nAt the time, she remembers, theories about the origins of autism tended to blame mothers, for being \u201ccold\u201d and withholding their affections. Much has happened regarding attitudes and treatment since she and Mike started their journey. Most important: Autism is no longer something people have to deal with in isolation.\n\n\u201cBefore, nobody knew about it,\u201d she remembers. \u201cNow, if you say autism to someone, they have a friend or relative with it.\u201d\n\nWhen she first took him to her family doctor, he said, \u201cMichael is the baby of the family, and sometimes the other kids do the talking for him, so maybe don\u2019t panic right now.\u201d\n\nIn retrospect, Judy observes, \u201cYou can\u2019t blame the doctors; they didn\u2019t know much about autism then.\u201d\n\nAs Mike\u2019s behavior worsened, the family doctor finally said the words: \u201cI think it\u2019s autism.\u201d\n\nA SEARCH FOR HELP\n\nA pediatrician took the boy through a battery of behavioral tests and confirmed the diagnosis. Further tests at Shands Hospital in Gainesville showed no abnormality in brain wave activity, however. In fact, the doctors thought Mike was quite bright.\n\nDuring the visit, she watched other autistic children \u2014 toddlers to teenagers \u2014 from behind a two-way mirror and learned some behavioral techniques to help her cope with Mike\u2019s outbursts.\n\nPublic schools were not allowing autistic children in classes at the time. The only way to get help was to have them declared \u201cretarded,\u201d Judy says. Doctors recommended a Montessori school, but he was too disruptive in class \u2014 slapping his hands, jumping up, screaming and making noises \u2014 so he could no longer attend.\n\nFor a while, he went to Beneva House, primarily for hearing-impaired children. The staff tried to teach him sign language, but Mike had too much energy and couldn\u2019t sit still.\n\nTeachers recommended putting him on the drug Ritalin to calm him down so he could learn. While it pacified him, the side effects were troubling.\n\n\u201cHe would be like a zombie and rock, rock, rock,\u201d Judy recalls. \u201cI didn\u2019t want my child to be like that, just to appease people. I wanted to find a way to communicate with him.\u201d\n\nShe found out a about an experimental behavioral modification program at Happiness House (now Easter Seals). The techniques worked \u2014 for a while.\n\n\u201cThings like fluorescent lighting and certain clothes fabrics would set him off. Back then, no one knew that they could cause the kids to have fits,\u201d Judy says.\n\nIt was difficult at home, too. Her husband couldn\u2019t take it anymore; there was a divorce. It was hard on her other two boys, too.\n\n\u201cKids can be very cruel; so can adults,\u201d Judy says. \u201cThey would say things like, \u2018Your brother is stupid, a dummy . . .\u2019 \u201d Other parents wouldn\u2019t allow their children to play at the Coates home. Judy would call them and say, \u201cWhat Mike has isn\u2019t catching, and maybe your kids would learn something \u2014 learn to be kind.\u201d\n\nWhen her older sons started failing in school and coping with Mike became increasingly difficult, the family physician told her she had to find another place for him. Judy is still upset about the way he asked her, \u201cIf you have gangrene in your leg and the doctor said that you would die, would you have it amputated?\u201d\n\nUnlike others, Judy has never given up on her son.\n\nAround the time he was 12, she heard about a new school for autistic children in Tampa. Living in a group home there with others like him made Mike more comfortable and helped him to control his anger. Judy would visit every weekend, and he would come home for holidays.\n\nMike graduated as a high school student from the autism program. From there he went to a MacDonald\u2019s training center and continued lived in a group home. But Judy felt the programs there were for people with all kinds of disabilities and didn't help him very much.\n\nWhen he was 25, Judy enrolled him in the Pyramid School in Tampa.\n\n\u201cThe programs there were a lot better,\u201d she says. \u201cThey started Michael in a cooking course in which he learned to make sandwiches.\u201d\n\nA DESIRE TO HELP\n\nMike is 44 now and still lives in Tampa. When he visits, he and Judy cook together and play mini-golf.\n\nIn the meantime, she has become a tireless advocate for families with autistic children. She has taken courses about the disorder at Florida State College and has read just about every book on the subject.\n\nFor the past two and a half years, she has been working on getting the Autism Family Center of Florida in Sarasota off the ground.\n\nShe has gotten a 501 C3 designation for the organization and is looking for a permanent space.\n\n\u201cFamilies need a place to go,\u201d she insists. \u201cI have lived it; I know what parents feel. I remember when we went to dinner, I would wind up in the car with Mike because he would act out and carry on.\u201d\n\nShe wants the center to have a cooking school and a small deli where parents can bring their child and have a sandwich.\n\n\u201cNo one will be judging them,\u201d she says, \u201cbecause the people waiting on them and clearing the tables will be autistic.\u201d\n\nThere also will be a multisensory room where children who have a meltdown can go to calm themselves. She wants to install a small movie theater, too.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all geared to creating a place where autistic families can enjoy each other\u2019s company,\u201d she explains.\n\n\u201cI wish they'd had something like it when Mike was little. But I can help create one now \u2014 a place where families can go, where autistic children can have fun; and where the older people, through sheltered workshops, can learn a trade which will lead to maybe earning a living.\u201d\n\n\n\nRESOURCES\n\n\u25a0 The Autism Family Center of Florida,pathwaysautism.com: The new Bradenton-based group plans \u201cto create programs to help people affected with autism learn valuable skills in order to lead a productive and independent life.\u201d\n\n\u25a0 Face Autism, face-autism.org: Based in Ellenton, this non-profit \u201cwas created in 2009 by a team of interested professionals and parents to provide sensory friendly activities, support groups, referral for therapeutic services, structured classes, and other necessary resources.\u201d\n\n\u25a0 Center for Autism Resources and Education, careautism.net: Lakewood Ranch-based CARE\u2019s mission is \u201cto provide continued education, professional training, resources and related support to parents, professionals and other caregivers.\u201d\n\n\u25a0 Autism Speaks, autismspeaks.org: This national organization \u201caims to bring the autism community together as one strong voice to urge the government and private sector to listen to our concerns and take action to address this urgent global health crisis.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://health.heraldtribune.com/files/2014/08/hfcov_0819.jpg"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd6bc\"", "article_summary": "For the past two and a half years, she has been working on getting the Autism Family Center of Florida in Sarasota off the ground.\nBut I can help create one now \u2014 a place where families can go, where autistic children can have fun; and where the older people, through sheltered workshops, can learn a trade which will lead to maybe earning a living.\u201dRESOURCES\u25a0 The Autism Family Center of Florida,pathwaysautism.com: The new Bradenton-based group plans \u201cto create programs to help people affected with autism learn valuable skills in order to lead a productive and independent life.\u201d\u25a0 Face Autism, face-autism.org: Based in Ellenton, this non-profit \u201cwas created in 2009 by a team of interested professionals and parents to provide sensory friendly activities, support groups, referral for therapeutic services, structured classes, and other necessary resources.\u201d\u25a0 Center for Autism Resources and Education, careautism.net: Lakewood Ranch-based CARE\u2019s mission is \u201cto provide continued education, professional training, resources and related support to parents, professionals and other caregivers.\u201d\u25a0 Autism Speaks, autismspeaks.org: This national organization \u201caims to bring the autism community together as one strong voice to urge the government and private sector to listen to our concerns and take action to address this urgent global health crisis.\u201d\nAt the time, she remembers, theories about the origins of autism tended to blame mothers, for being \u201ccold\u201d and withholding their affections.\nThe story will sound familiar to any parent of a child on the autism spectrum \u2014 now one in every 68 children in the United States.\nMost important: Autism is no longer something people have to deal with in isolation."}
