BAE Systems PLC reports full-year results before markets open on Thursday amid signs that a prolonged period of contracting western defense spending is ending, notably in the U.S.. Here’s what’s to watch in the earnings report from Europe’s largest weapons maker:

EARNINGS FORECAST: Earnings, stripping out the impact of financial derivatives and one-time items, fell to 38 pence a share last year from 42 pence in the previous year, according to an average analysts’ forecast collated by data provider FactSet. BAE warned last September that earnings could fall much as 10%. The drop largely reflects a one-off boost the company received in 2013 from a contract settlement with Saudi Arabia over an earlier sale of Typhoon combat aircraft.

REVENUE FORECAST: Revenue fell 7.5% to £16.8 billion, according to the analysts’ consensus forecast.
