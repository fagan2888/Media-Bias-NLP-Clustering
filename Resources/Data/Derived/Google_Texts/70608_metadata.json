Some people are coming because they\u2019ve been abused by someone in the church.\u201d\n\nIn fact, it was three weeks ago that a grand jury report alleged two bishops from the Altoona-Johnstown Diocese helped cover up the sexual abuse of children by more than 50 priests over decades.\n\nIt did not involve the Pittsburgh Diocese, and the \u201cService of Apology\u201d was planned well before the announcement.\n\nJoin The Conversation On The KDKA Facebook Page\n\nStay Up To Date, Follow KDKA On Twitter\n\nBishop Zubik held his first \u201cService of Apology\u201d when he was in Green Bay, after he was inspired by Pope John Paul II. Then, he held one in here in Pittsburgh in 2009.\n\n\u201cMy staff in Green Bay, and when I came back to Pittsburgh for the first time, my staff said, \u2018I don\u2019t think that\u2019s such a good idea for you to do it,\u2019 but I felt it was,\u201d said Bishop Zubik. \u201cIt was an important risk to take.\u201d\n\nHe says both times his staff feared it could make the hurt worse, but he wants people to know his words are sincere.\n\n\u201cJust by my saying I\u2019m sorry for the church, I\u2019m not expecting that\u2019s going to make it easier for people,\u201d said Bishop Zubik. \u201cBut I hope at least it\u2019s going to the help there to be a new beginning for folks.\u201d\n\nThe bishop leaves for Washington D.C. Tuesday.\n\nHe\u2019s the lead petitioner in a case going before the U.S. Supreme Court this week that challenges part of the Affordable Care Act. Specifically, whether church-related organizations have to pay for contraception as part of healthcare.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A \"Service of Apology\" was held Monday evening by Pittsburgh Catholic Diocese Bishop David Zubik.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"url": "http://pittsburgh.cbslocal.com/2016/03/21/nearly-100-parishioners-gather-for-bishop-zubiks-service-of-apology/", "image": {"width": 1024, "secure_url": "https://cbspittsburgh.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/bishop-david-zubik.jpg?w=1024", "identifier": "https://cbspittsburgh.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/bishop-david-zubik.jpg?w=1024", "height": 576}, "type": "article", "description": "A \"Service of Apology\" was held Monday evening by Pittsburgh Catholic Diocese Bishop David Zubik.", "title": "Nearly 100 Parishioners Gather For Bishop Zubik\u2019s \u201cService Of Apology\u201d"}, "twitter": {"image": "https://cbspittsburgh.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/bishop-david-zubik.jpg?w=1024", "description": "A \"Service of Apology\" was held Monday evening by Pittsburgh Catholic Diocese Bishop David Zubik.", "site": "/CBSPittsburgh", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Nearly 100 Parishioners Gather For Bishop Zubik\u2019s \u201cService Of Apology\u201d"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "News, Sports, Weather, Traffic and the Best of Pittsburgh", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "application-name": "CBS Pittsburgh", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/CBSPittsburgh", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/CBSPittsburgh"}, "keywords": "catholic diocese of pittsburgh, bishop david zubik, pittsburgh catholic diocese, zubik service of apology mass, saint paul cathedral, service of apology mass", "google-site-verification": "44caXBf4kjHeKKAT7ZZ89NaCX25utL_yRSa-qGpwIhY", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://pittsburgh.cbslocal.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/97501d9d4ef7a23e7663780b0a506821?s=16", "news_keywords": "bishop david zubik, david highfield, mass, pittsburgh catholic diocese, saint paul cathedral, service of apology"}, "article_summary": "PITTSBURGH (KDKA) \u2014 A \u201cService of Apology\u201d was held Monday evening by Pittsburgh Catholic Diocese Bishop David Zubik.\nCameras were not allowed inside the service at Saint Paul Cathedral in Oakland, but nearly 100 people gathered to hear what Bishop Zubik had to say.\nIt did not involve the Pittsburgh Diocese, and the \u201cService of Apology\u201d was planned well before the announcement.\n\u201cSome of the people said they\u2019re coming because they\u2019re angry that I closed a church building,\u201d said Bishop Zubik.\n\u201cJust by my saying I\u2019m sorry for the church, I\u2019m not expecting that\u2019s going to make it easier for people,\u201d said Bishop Zubik."}
