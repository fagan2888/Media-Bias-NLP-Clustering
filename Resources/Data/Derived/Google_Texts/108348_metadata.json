(J. Scott Applewhite/AP)\n\nI\u2019ve been radicalized. By Harry Reid and Barack Obama. Goodbye moderation and sweet reason. No more clinging to constitutional and procedural restraint. It\u2019s time to go nuclear.\n\nIn the fourth quarter of his presidency, Obama unbound is abusing presidential authority at will to secure a legacy on everything from environmental regulation to immigration, the laws of which he would unilaterally suspend.\n\nRepublicans find themselves on the sidelines bleating plaintively about violations of the separation of powers. They thought they found an instrument of resistance in funding for the Department of Homeland Security. The House has funded the whole department except for the immigration service, which was denied the money to implement Obama\u2019s executive amnesty.\n\nBut Democrats have filibustered the bill in the Senate, where it will die. And as the night follows day, Republicans, not the filibustering Democrats, will be blamed for shutting down DHS and jeopardizing the nation\u2019s safety at a time of heightened international terrorism.\n\nA nice cul-de-sac. But there is a way out for the GOP. Go bold. Go nuclear. Abolish the filibuster. Pass the bill and send it to the president.\n\nI know that breaks a lot of china. But Congress is already knee-deep in fractured porcelain. On policy, Obama has repeatedly usurped congressional power, most egregiously with an executive amnesty for illegal immigrants that for four years he himself had insisted was unlawful (a view given significant support this week in a federal district court).\n\nAs for procedure, then-majority leader Reid (D-Nev.) went nuclear in November 2013 when he abolished the filibuster for presidential appointees and judicial nominees (below the Supreme Court). He did it to pack the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals with liberals. The nation\u2019s liberal chorus cheered. \u201cElections are supposed to have consequences,\u201d read one typical commentary. \u201cIt was time to push the button.\u201d Boom.\n\nMy beef with Reid was not what he did but how he did it. The filibuster has grown in use and power over the decades to the point of dysfunction. Everything needed 60 votes. This is relatively new and nowhere to be found in the Constitution.\n\nMy problem was the egregious way Reid changed the rule: by a simple majority, 52-48, with zero Republicans onboard (and three Democrats defecting). As I wrote at the time, \u201cIf a bare majority can change the fundamental rules that govern an institution, then there are no rules.\u201d\n\nI was not the only one to warn that Democrats would rue the day. Once you go nuclear, so can the other guy.\n\nReid went first. Time for Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) to finish the job. Push the button. Abolish the filibuster.\n\nThen immediately pass the House homeland security bill and send it to the president. He is likely to veto it, but the politics will have been radically changed. The current story line is: Republican Congress won\u2019t fund DHS, threatening to shut it down. New story line: Obama vetoes funding for DHS, threatening to shut it down.\n\nThe latter narrative is more accurate: Democrats are stopping the funding. Moreover, a presidential veto would lead to a more fair allocation of blame. And it\u2019s blame allocation that determines which side blinks first. The president will have a major incentive to find some face-saving finesse.\n\nBut filibuster abolition is more than a one-shot proposition. It would radically change the next two years. It would give Republicans full control of the Congress and allow swift passage of a GOP agenda.\n\nIt would also clarify the antagonists: a lawless president vs. a willful Congress. The GOP could be sending bill after bill to the president\u2019s desk \u2014 on tax reform, trade, Obamacare and, if it has the guts, immigration.\n\nObama\u2019s choice? Sign, veto or negotiate a compromise. If he vetoes, then Republicans take that issue to the country in 2016.\n\nWhat\u2019s the downside? Democrats showed in 2013 their willingness to trash Senate procedure for a mess of pottage \u2014 three judges on one court. If Republicans stand pat now, what\u2019s to stop Democrats from abolishing the filibuster altogether when it suits them in the future?\n\nAnd think of the upside. A GOP resort to the nuclear option might make Democrats come to their senses and negotiate a new understanding that any fundamental change in Senate rules \u2014 e.g., altering the filibuster \u2014 will henceforth require some agreed-to supermajority. No more bare-majority party-line coups.\n\nThis would be ideal. But that\u2019s for later. For now, go for the doable. Abolish the filibuster and challenge the president. And when asked, \u201cHow can you do such a thing?\u201d tell them to ask Harry Reid.\n\nRead more from Charles Krauthammer\u2019s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The GOP should finish what the Democrats started and direct the blame to Harry Reid.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/pages/Charles-Krauthammer/95978776589", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "The GOP should finish what the Democrats started and direct the blame to Harry Reid.", "title": "Abolish the filibuster", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/abolish-the-filibuster/2015/02/19/ca7d30d2-b86b-11e4-aa05-1ce812b3fdd2_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2015/02/19/Editorial-Opinion/Images/Yucca_Mountain_NRC_Report-07ff4-1356.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@krauthammer"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/abolish-the-filibuster/2015/02/19/ca7d30d2-b86b-11e4-aa05-1ce812b3fdd2_story.html", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "charles krauthammer, harry reid, mitch mcconnell, president obama, filibuster, Department of Homeland Security", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/pages/Charles-Krauthammer/95978776589"}, "eomportal-uuid": "ca7d30d2-b86b-11e4-aa05-1ce812b3fdd2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "charles krauthammer, harry reid, mitch mcconnell, president obama, filibuster, Department of Homeland Security"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0f1e\"", "article_summary": "Abolish the filibuster and challenge the president.\nAbolish the filibuster.\nIf Republicans stand pat now, what\u2019s to stop Democrats from abolishing the filibuster altogether when it suits them in the future?\nThe filibuster has grown in use and power over the decades to the point of dysfunction.\nAs for procedure, then-majority leader Reid (D-Nev.) went nuclear in November 2013 when he abolished the filibuster for presidential appointees and judicial nominees (below the Supreme Court)."}
