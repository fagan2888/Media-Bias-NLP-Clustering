The Avalanche’s schedule for the 2014-15 season will be released next month, but one contest Avs fans will not see listed is an outdoor game at Coors Field.

NHL sources said Denver will not get an outdoor game this coming season, despite heavy previous speculation it would. The good news: Denver is likely to get one in 2015-16, the sources said.

If Denver had hosted an outdoor game this winter, it would have been part of the NHL’s Coors Light Stadium Series, as the 2015 Winter Classic will be played in Washington, most likely at Nationals Park.

Whether Denver will host the Winter Classic or a Stadium Series game has yet to be determined.

Coors Field is the most likely venue for an outdoor game, a natural sponsorship tie-in to the beer company that is one of the league’s biggest advertisers.

Outdoor games have become a huge ratings and financial success for the NHL since the first Winter Classic in 2008 in Buffalo, N.Y. Warmer-weather cities have been included in the expansion of outdoor games, including one played earlier this year at Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles.
