The Community Action Committee is partnering with Volunteer Income Tax Assistance to offer the service to those with low and moderate income levels.\n\nBrenda Joyce Blair started using the program Thursday morning by filling out paperwork.\n\n\u201cYou get lost in numbers, and you don\u2019t want to fill out the paperwork wrong. These are the people to talk to because they\u2019ll go over step-by-step with you to make sure you don\u2019t make a mistake with the IRS,\u201d Blair said.\n\nBlair then got one-on-one help from volunteers certified by the IRS.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re very cordial and they have a nice attitude, and they carry you through the process and where you\u2019re not hindered but helped,\u201d Blair said.\n\nCollege professor Richard Grover has been volunteering with the program for six years. He says he enjoys helping people navigate through a complicated system.\n\n\u201cThere is a lot of people who couldn\u2019t get their taxes done to be honest taxes are so complex the average person just can\u2019t do it,\u201d Grover said.\n\nSue Campbell helps run the program and says this year they expect to serve at least 2,000 people. She says they expect to be busier than last year because there is new paperwork involved with the Affordable Care Act.\n\nPrevious story: How the Affordable Care Act affects how you file income taxes\n\n\u201cThey know when they come here if there\u2019s a problem, we will help them work through it,\u201d Campbell said.\n\nNo appointment is necessary, but Campbell says to make sure to bring important tax paperwork with you, including any deduction information you might have.\n\nThe service will run through April 15 at the CAC L.T.
