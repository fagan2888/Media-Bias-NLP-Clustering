Tim Bishop.\n\nBoth House Republicans\u2019 campaign arm and a outside GOP electoral group announced big spending on ads trashing the lawmaker - even as Democrats rolled out their first spot attakcing Bishop's opponent.\n\nThe spending shows that Bishop\u2019s race against Republican State Sen. Lee Zeldin in New York\u2019s an eastern Long Island congressional district is a top priority for the GOP. Bishop becomes the first House Democrat in the Northeast attacked in television ad paid for the National Republican Congressional Committee.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s obviously a top target,\u201d said a GOP campaign operative.\n\nA Republican group, the American Action Network, announced Tuesday that it will drop a whopping $1.2 million in October on television and digital ads ripping Bishop. That\u2019s the largest chunk of $8 million that organization, run by former Minnesota Sen. Norm Coleman, said it is spending in nine House races.\n\nA person familiar with the plan said the group will run spots that hit Bishop on his support for Affordable Care Act and an incident that landed the lawmaker under investigation by the House Ethics Committee.\n\nBishop helped a New York hedge fund executive secure a permit for a fireworks display to celebrate his son\u2019s Bar Mitzvah, then hit he man up for a campaign contribution within days.\n\n\u201cAfter helping a constituent obtain government permits, Bishop pressed him for 10 grand,\u201d a narrator says in the spot. \u201cBishop got the cash. And in secret emails revealed by investigators, he bragged \u201cjust call me the mail man.\u201d\n\nThe ad is running from Sep. 9-Sep. 15 in a sizable, $231,000 buy, a NRCC spokesman said.\n\nBy law, the NRCC and AAN cannot coordinate their advertising strategies. Both said the dual announcements Tuesday are coincidental.\n\nRepublicans say polling in the district shows Bishop is vulnerable to ads focused on the ethics issue.\n\nThe AAN spending is helping Republicans fight back against a big fundraising advantage by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. The DCCC has outraised the NRCC by $27 million this election cycle.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.thumb": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.1685123.1393042271!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/tim-bishop-official-pic-jpg.jpg", "description": "Both House Republicans\u2019 campaign arm and a GOP SuperPAC announced big spending today on negative ads trashing the lawmaker.
