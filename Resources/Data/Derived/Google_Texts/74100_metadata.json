Coventry insurance will no longer be offered, so consumers will need to pick another option in the federal marketplace.\n\nA coalition of community health centers, clinics and area hospitals are partnering to host the event at Wichita\u2019s Century II to help people sign up and get questions answered about available health insurance. Navigator project coordinator Veronica Miranda with Cover Kansas says there are two companies offering coverage in the marketplace.\n\n\"All the consumers that had a Coventry plan will need to visit the marketplace before December 15th to select a new health plan with either Blue Cross Blue Shield or United Health Care,\" Miranda says. \"Those are the two companies that will be participating in the marketplace for 2016.\"\n\nMiranda says plans and premiums do change, so it\u2019s recommended that consumers visit the marketplace annually. She says eight out of 10 people enrolled in the marketplace qualified for financial assistance. Navigators will help determine who would qualify.\n\nThe enrollment event will take place at Century II on Dec. 5.\n\n--\n\nCarla Eckels is assistant news director and the host of Soulsations.
