The margins in the state senate are so slim that a change in just of one of the chamber\u2019s three contested races could punch a hole in Governor Asa Hutchinson\u2019s budget.\n\n\u201cIn all candor, the number one objective for the senate is to stop the Obamacare Medicaid expansion,\u201d said Copeland.\n\nDonnie Copeland, a Pentecostal pastor and state Representative, wants to unseat Jane English to represent Senate District 34 stretching through parts of Maumelle, North Little Rock, and Sherwood. I spoke to English at a restaurant in her district.\n\n\u201cAs we move on down the road and the governor presents his two budgets \u2013 one with and one without \u2013 I think that people are going to be able to see exactly what the holes are,\u201d said English. \u201cIf you look at other states like Louisiana, they\u2019re in a huge deficit now because they didn\u2019t do anything.\u201d\n\nThere are just three state senate primaries, all Republican, and all bitterly divided over Medicaid expansion with incumbents leaning in favor of the governor\u2019s version of it \u2013 known as Arkansas Works. On the first day of early voting Governor Hutchinson offered political cover while speaking at the Capitol.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re making the linkage between everybody who supports Arkansas Works and any form of the Medicaid expansion in the states must be an ardent supporter of Obamacare or the Affordable Care Act. Let me tell you today, that is not so and we need to debunk that argument,\u201d said Hutchinson with a dozen legislators including English standing behind him.\n\nCopeland isn\u2019t buying it. He says conservatives shouldn\u2019t take federal dollars made possible by the Affordable Care Act to give insurance to an expanded group of low-income people.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s wrong, I\u2019m not afraid to say it at all, he\u2019s wrong. He was wrong, and I think the world of him in many respects, but he is wrong on this and on the wrong side of public opinion and the voters,\u201d said Copeland about Medicaid expansion, which the majority of Republican governors have opted not to participate in.\n\nEnglish gave a critical vote in 2014 that kept the state\u2019s politically beleaguered version of Medicaid expansion, known as the private option, alive. Eight senators voted in opposition, a ninth could have stopped the program. Copeland wants to be that ninth vote.\n\n\u201cIf you have a Republican executive branch, and control of both legislative branches and none of those have the will and the spine to stop it then you have to get control,\u201d said Copeland. \u201cI would add that\u2019s the will of the people.\u201d\n\nPolitical scientist Greg Shufeldt at the University of Arkansas at Little Rock says English\u2019s support, a switch from her opposition in 2013, came with strings attached. Legislation overhauling the state\u2019s workforce development system passed under English\u2019s direction.\n\n\u201cMost political players have been fairly straightforward about the close nature of the vote. Senator English was in a position of power and she used that position to move a passion project for her that\u2019s not necessarily related to healthcare. But she used this opportunity,\u201d said Shufeldt.\n\nSenator English invoked former Democratic Governor Mike Beebe in her defense. She said they both saw re-structuring workforce development \u2013 something English has been involved with for decades \u2013 as connected to Medicaid expansion.\n\n\u201cHe reiterated more than one time that this was not something I was doing for myself. I wasn\u2019t trading it off for something for the district but this was a statewide issue that needed to be addressed,\u201d she said.\n\nSome special interest groups, like Conduit for Action, have targeted English for her vote. Copeland does too, and throws on criticism of English\u2019s workforce goals\n\n\u201cYou have traded the vote for another government program that by the way, last time I checked businesses start jobs. If you want to spend $13-14 million let\u2019s spend it on entrepreneurs,\u201d said Copeland.\n\nEnglish says her changes to the workforce development system \u2013 which push high schools and two-year colleges to develop programs like welding to meet the job needs of local industry - will help move people out of poverty and off of Medicaid expansion.\n\n\u201cGet people off of these programs, give them enough skills and education to be able to go get a job that takes care of themselves and their families. It\u2019s easy to say everybody ought to go get a job. But if you were in this category, where a lot of those folks are, they don\u2019t have the skills to get a job where somebody\u2019s going to pay their insurance,\u201d said English.\n\nThe governor plans for the legislature to vote on his version of Medicaid expansion, which is dependent upon federal approval, a little over a month after the March 1 primary. Hutchinson says his budget and care for 200,000-plus Arkansans hang in the balance.\n\nShufeldt says it\u2019s a test of governance that could define the party\u2019s future \u2013 although no matter the results the incumbents will get to vote on the program this April.\n\n\u201cYou really have to weight these sorts of ideological purity arguments versus a more pragmatic approach to governing.\u201d Shufeldt said the electorate could be especially partisan, \u201cWhat\u2019s going to be presenting an issue is that most of these races aren\u2019t competitive in November so the real contest for most state legislators is can they win their primary?\u201d\n\nAnd this year is especially unpredictable, Shufeldt says, since Arkansas moved its primary up from late April to March 1, Super Tuesday, it\u2019ll be the first competitive presidential primary in recent memory.
