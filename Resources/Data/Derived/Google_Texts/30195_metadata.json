But even though most people now take some steps to communicate their wishes, many may still receive more intensive care than they would have wished, a study this month found.\n\nThe study, published online in JAMA Oncology, examined survey data from the Health and Retirement Study, a national study of U.S. residents older than age 50. Researchers analyzed the responses from the next of kin, usually a spouse or child, of 1,985 participants with cancer who died between 2000 and 2012.\n\nThe patients\u2019 family members responded to questions about how frequently patients had signed durable power of attorney documents or living wills or participated in conversations about their end-of life-preferences. Researchers then examined the association between those advance-care-planning activities and the medical care the cancer patients received at the end of life.\n\nOver the study period, the use of durable power of attorney assignment, sometimes called a health care proxy, grew from 52 percent to 74 percent among participants. Small declines were reported in other planning activities \u2014 from 49 percent to 40 percent for living wills and 68 percent to 60 percent for end-of-life discussions \u2014 but they weren\u2019t statistically significant because the levels varied throughout the study period, says Dr. Amol Narang, a radiation oncologist at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine and the lead author of the study.\n\n\u201cOur hypothesis was that we\u2019d see significant increases over the study period in advance directives,\u201d Narang says. \u201cWhat we saw was that important aspects of advance care planning haven\u2019t increased.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, the proportion of patients who were reported to have received \u201call care possible\u201d at the end of their lives increased substantially over the study period, from 7 percent to 58 percent, even though such intensive treatment may have been counter to their stated wishes.\n\nA durable power of attorney allows consumers to appoint someone to make health care decisions for them if patients are unable to do so. Living wills describe the types of medical care people wish to receive (or don\u2019t wish to receive) if they\u2019re incapacitated. Neither requires a lawyer, and forms are often available online.\n\nSimply signing a document isn\u2019t enough, experts say. There\u2019s no substitute for regular communication with friends and family about end-of-life preferences.\n\n\u201cPatients may have signed that power of attorney, but if they haven\u2019t discussed their preferences with that person the proxy may default to \u2018all care necessary,\u2019\u201d Narang says. In other words, lacking clear guidance, the health care proxy may choose to err on the safe side and approve more care rather than limit or withhold it.\n\nLiving wills spell out which treatments someone would want \u2014 specifying that they would want to be put on a ventilator, for example, or fed through a tube. But some experts say treatment-focused specificity may not serve patients\u2019 best interests.\n\nSpelling out treatment preferences is only useful in context, says Dr. Diane Meier, director of the Center to Advance Palliative Care.\n\n\u201cOf course you would want to be put on a ventilator if it was going to return you to health,\u201d Meier says.\n\nThe more important question is a qualitative one: What is the quality of life that is unacceptable to you? Would you want every measure taken to treat an illness or injury even if it meant enduring extreme pain with little likelihood of improvement? Or would you rather forgo such intensive treatment and be kept comfortable instead? Those are the conversations that need to happen, experts say.\n\nThe issue is front and center these days as policy makers debate the recent federal proposal to reimburse physicians for conversations with Medicare patients about advance care planning.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a significant step in the right direction,\u201d says Jonathan Keyserling, senior vice president for health policy at the National Hospice and Palliative Care Organization.\n\n\u201cNow that health care professionals can soon be reimbursed for these intimate and thoughtful conversations, I think we\u2019ll see changes in practice patterns and in decisions by family members.\u201d\n\nSome policy experts say that changing payment practices won\u2019t be enough to change clinical practice.\n\nFor physicians, offering treatment, even if there\u2019s little chance it will help, is the only way they may know to show their loyalty and love for a patient, says Meier.\n\n\u201cWe have to change the training or nothing will change,\u201d she says.\n\nFor that reason, she hopes that the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services will require doctors to get some training in how to introduce and take part in conversations about advance care planning rather than simply check a box on a form that says a conversation took place.\n\nBy Michelle Andrews, Kaiser Health News\n\n###\n\nKaiser Health News (KHN) is a nonprofit national health policy news service.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Even though most people now communicate their wishes through living wills, many still receive more intensive cancer care than they would have wished", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Physicians News", "description": "Even though most people now communicate their wishes through living wills, many still receive more intensive cancer care than they would have wished", "title": "Despite Living Wills, Patients Get More End-Of-Life Cancer Care Than Desired | Physicians News", "url": "https://physiciansnews.com/2015/07/21/despite-living-wills-patients-get-more-end-of-life-cancer-care-than-desired/", "image": {"width": 370, "identifier": "https://physiciansnews.com/photos/2014/11/end-of-life.jpg", "height": 247}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Even though most people now communicate their wishes through living wills, many still receive more intensive cancer care than they would have wished", "creator": "@physiciansnews", "image": "https://physiciansnews.com/photos/2014/11/end-of-life.jpg", "title": "Despite Living Wills, Patients Get More End-Of-Life Cancer Care Than Desired | Physicians News", "site": "@physiciansnews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "DC.date.issued": "2015-07-21T16:31:58+00:00", "fb": {"app_id": 55890074158}, "google-site-verification": "P61CH5fWglh1iNtxWWsRbgzgMZr93KOnBlZ0JncQcSI", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/physiciansnews", "section": "Featured", "tag": "power of attorney", "published_time": "2015-07-21T16:31:58+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb833\"", "article_summary": "By Michelle Andrews, Kaiser Health News###Kaiser Health News (KHN) is a nonprofit national health policy news service.\nIn other words, lacking clear guidance, the health care proxy may choose to err on the safe side and approve more care rather than limit or withhold it.\nResearchers then examined the association between those advance-care-planning activities and the medical care the cancer patients received at the end of life.\nA durable power of attorney allows consumers to appoint someone to make health care decisions for them if patients are unable to do so.\nLiving wills describe the types of medical care people wish to receive (or don\u2019t wish to receive) if they\u2019re incapacitated."}
