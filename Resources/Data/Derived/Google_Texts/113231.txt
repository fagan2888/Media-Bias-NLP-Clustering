After six straight days of rain, cold temperatures turned Boulder's persistent precipitation into snow overnight, with nearly 4 inches falling on the city, bringing a snowy sheen to Mother's Day for the second consecutive year.

According to Boulder meteorologist Matt Kelsch, 3.9 inches of snow had fallen in Boulder by 7 a.m., far shy of the possible 10 inches that had been forecast.

While more snow and rain are expected this morning, the National Weather Service forecast calls for that to taper off by afternoon, with a total daytime snow accumulation of just half an inch.

The Boulder snow record for May 10 is 5.2 inches, set in 2003.

The winter storm advisory over Boulder County was set to expire at 9 a.m. today, although a frost advisory will remain in place until 9 a.m. Monday.

NWS Meteorologist Lisa Kriederman had warned that the expected bands of heavy, wet snow "could mean broken branches, weighed-down power lines and possible outages."

Monday's forecast calls for mostly sunny skies with a high near 56 and no rain. By Tuesday, however, there's a slight chance of showers and thunderstorms in the afternoon, a pattern that will repeat throughout the week.
