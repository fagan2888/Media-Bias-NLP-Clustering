It should not be that way. No child deserves to die like that.\u201d\n\nDozens gathered and marched to that street corner on Monday, outraged over what happened here days ago.\n\n\u201cAsk for help, there are programs to get your kids out of gangs,\u201d said LaTonya Sharpe, who organized the march. \u201cYou cannot let these people have your children or we will be back here again.\u201d\n\nInvestigators have not said whether the shooting was gang related, but many believe it was.\n\nThose who marched carried signs. They invited neighbors to join as they walked. Many did.\n\nThey shouted for an end to the violence.\n\n\u201cThis child here, this did not have to happen,\u201d Sharpe said.\n\nRobert Freeman was among those who walked. A cousin of Brian, he had a message for those causing trouble.\n\n\u201cStop being stupid,\u201d he said. \u201cAct like you have sense. Go do something positive with your life and stop shooting people.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30;polling-uri=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.wral.com/rss/48&id=1;polling-uri2=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.wral.com/rss/48&id=2;polling-uri3=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.wral.com/rss/48&id=3;polling-uri4=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.wral.com/rss/48&id=4;polling-uri5=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.wral.com/rss/48&id=5;cycle=1", "dcterms.created": "2014-01-20 22:47:40", "description": "Dozens marched for 15-year-old Brian Freeman Monday night, who was shot and killed while walking home with a friend on Friday.", "application-name": "WRAL.com", "dcterms.modified": "2014-01-20 22:47:40", "outbrain": {"ob_desc": "id_asset=13313755|asset_type=story"}, "twitter": {"description": "Dozens marched for 15-year-old Brian Freeman Monday night, who was shot and killed while walking home with a friend on Friday.", "title": "Dozens march for slain Rocky Mount teen :: WRAL.com", "url": "http://www.wral.com/dozens-march-for-slain-rocky-mount-teen/13313755/", "image": "http://wwwcache.wral.com/asset/news/local/2014/01/20/13313766/13313766-1390271186-160x120.jpg", "site": "@wral", "card": "summary"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#041E30", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "/favicons/mstile-70x70.png", "robots": "index,follow", "pinterest": "nohover", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "/favicons/mstile-310x310.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "/favicons/mstile-310x150.png", "fb": {"app_id": 334167666672300}, "author": "WRAL", "article": {"published_time": "2014-01-20T22:47:40-05:00"}, "msapplication-square150x150logo": "/favicons/mstile-150x150.png", "og": {"site_name": "WRAL.com", "description": "Dozens marched for 15-year-old Brian Freeman Monday night, who was shot and killed while walking home with a friend on Friday.", "title": "Dozens march for slain Rocky Mount teen :: WRAL.com", "url": "http://www.wral.com/dozens-march-for-slain-rocky-mount-teen/13313755/", "image": "http://wwwcache.wral.com/asset/news/local/2014/01/20/13313766/54682-IMG_20140120_180427-698x485.jpg", "type": "article"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "msapplication-TileImage": "/favicons/mstile-144x144.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd329b\"", "article_summary": "No child deserves to die like that.\u201dDozens gathered and marched to that street corner on Monday, outraged over what happened here days ago.\nIt was at the corner of East Highland Avenue and Woodland Avenue where Brian Freeman was shot and killed on Friday.\nBrian was walking with a friend when a car pulled alongside the 15-year-old and shots were fired, said his aunt, Gloria Deans.\n\u201cAsk for help, there are programs to get your kids out of gangs,\u201d said LaTonya Sharpe, who organized the march.\nGo do something positive with your life and stop shooting people.\u201d"}
