UnitedHealth Group Inc., the U.S.\u2019s biggest health insurer, quit the group in June over a difference in strategy. Aetna Inc., another giant that will grow even larger with its upcoming purchase of Humana Inc., left at the end of 2015. Together, the exiting insurers cover about one in four Americans.\n\nMarilyn Tavenner Photographer: Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg\n\n\u201cThe departures of these two big members has been a blow to the industry\u2019s ability to represent itself with one voice,\u201d said Terry Holt, a Republican strategist who focuses on health-care issues at HDMK.\n\nThe departures are also a challenge to the trade group\u2019s new chief executive officer, Marilyn Tavenner. The former Obama administration official took over in August, and her Democratic background has little political overlap with some of AHIP\u2019s biggest members. Now, she has to lure back the wayward insurers.\n\nWin Them Back\n\n\u201cOne of our primary goals is to make sure we meet them at their space and have them rejoin AHIP,\u201d Tavenner said in an interview. \u201cFrom my perspective, the door is open and we want them back, and both of them know that.\u201d\n\nShe disputed the idea that she was too tied to Democrats, and said that she\u2019s spent much of her career in private industry roles. \u201cI think I\u2019m probably seen as a pretty bipartisan person.\u201d\n\nAHIP is one of Washington\u2019s biggest spenders, according to data from the Center for Responsive Politics. It spent $9.2 million on lobbying in 2014, the most recent year available, ranking it 36th out of 3,514 organizations. That total doesn\u2019t include individual spending by companies -- UnitedHealth, for example, spent $2.6 million on lobbying in 2014.\n\nTensions and splits inside the lobbying group have been developing for years, said people familiar with its inner politics. AHIP is filled with companies who have very different businesses and policy needs. It contains health insurers large and small, including regional nonprofits and some of the biggest publicly traded companies in America.\n\nLong Tensions\n\nEven within the large companies, there are splits. Humana focuses on Medicare, while Cigna Corp. is weighted toward covering employees of businesses. The group\u2019s board also includes Genworth Financial Inc., which sells life insurance and long-term care, and Principal Financial Group Inc., a life and retirement company that also has a disability-insurance business.\n\nThe tensions go back as far as the passage of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, in 2010. The law overhauled the industry, creating new regulations and helping fund health coverage for millions of Americans.\n\nLess than a year after the law\u2019s passage, the five biggest for-profit insurers, including Aetna, UnitedHealth and Humana, were meeting secretly in a \u201cgroup of five,\u201d disgruntled with AHIP\u2019s direction, people familiar with the matter said at the time.\n\nLingering Discontent\n\nThe large, publicly traded health plans have long felt that they deserved more of a say over AHIP\u2019s strategy and priorities because of their size, according to people familiar with their thinking. The big plans tend to pay more in dues, even though they each get the same say on AHIP\u2019s governance as the group\u2019s smaller companies, according to public disclosures and Tavenner.\n\nWhen UnitedHealth quit AHIP, the company said its interests were \u201cno longer best represented by AHIP,\u201d and that AHIP\u2019s strategy didn\u2019t match its own. \u201cAHIP has to respond to its needs and interest of many members, which understandably resulted in a more limited and complicated advocacy focus,\u201d UnitedHealth said at the time.\n\nAHIP\u2019s board is now weighing adjustments to both how AHIP is run and how dues are set, Tavenner said. Still, it\u2019ll have to find a balance that keeps its roughly 200 members happy.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to do everything I can to win them back,\u201d Tavenner said of Aetna and UnitedHealth. \u201cPart of that is about strategy, part of that is about input. The board here recognizes that and wants to work with them as well.\u201d\n\nTavenner said lawmakers are still turning to AHIP for the industry\u2019s position. Among the group\u2019s recent wins was a one-year suspension of a tax on health insurers that was enacted as part of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nMore of a Say\n\nMark Bertolini, Aetna\u2019s CEO, said at an investor conference this week that Aetna might be willing to rejoin AHIP if the group gives his insurer more of a say, according to a report by Inside Health Policy.\n\nFinancially, the departures will make at least a small dent in AHIP\u2019s $64.5 million in revenue, which comes from member dues and fees from conferences and education, according to public records. Aetna accounted for about $1.1 million in dues, and UnitedHealth a similar amount. The money goes to pay for lobbying, staff salaries, advertising and events.\n\nAnthem and Cigna -- No. 2 and No. 4 in the industry by membership, respectively -- both said they find membership in AHIP to be valuable. \u201cAn industry that can work through policy issues and speak with a unified voice is a stronger industry,\u201d Anthem said in a statement.\n\nIt\u2019s not unusual for there to be discord when big companies, and egos, come together to try to bend lawmakers\u2019 ears in Washington. But companies usually realize they\u2019re better served by working together, said Dan Mendelson, president of Washington health-consulting firm Avalere Health LLC. He thinks UnitedHealth and Aetna will eventually come back.\n\n\u201cWhen a member of Congress is fashioning legislation, they\u2019re not going to go to every company in the industry,\u201d Mendelson said. \u201cThey\u2019re going to need to come back because there needs to be one consistent voice.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Zachary Tracer", "twitter": {"description": "America\u2019s Health Insurance Plans is one of Washington\u2019s most powerful lobby groups, spending millions of dollars a year to influence lawmakers, the White House and scores of state officials on the industry\u2019s priorities.", "title": "Powerful Health Insurance Lobby's New Goal: Win Back Members", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-01-15/powerful-health-insurance-lobby-s-new-goal-win-back-members", "image": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/izmiy7Q94sX4/v1/-1x-1.jpg", "site": "@business", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-author": "Zachary Tracer", "parsely-type": "post", "keywords": "Humana Inc,Aetna Inc,UnitedHealth Group Inc,Health", "news_keywords": "Humana Inc,Aetna Inc,UnitedHealth Group Inc,Health", "parsely-link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-01-15/powerful-health-insurance-lobby-s-new-goal-win-back-members", "parsely-title": "Powerful Health Insurance Lobby's New Goal: Win Back Members", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ff0000", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "parsely-pub-date": "2016-01-15T10:00:00.000Z", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "description": "America\u2019s Health Insurance Plans is one of Washington\u2019s most powerful lobby groups, spending millions of dollars a year to influence lawmakers, the White House and scores of state officials on the industry\u2019s priorities.", "parsely-tags": "Humana Inc,Aetna Inc,UnitedHealth Group Inc,Health,Region: Global,Page: article", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://assets.bwbx.io/business/public/images/favicons/mstile-144x144-bbd2101292.png", "date": "2016-01-15T10:00:00.000Z", "parsely-section": "science-energy", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "og": {"site_name": "Bloomberg.com", "description": "America\u2019s Health Insurance Plans is one of Washington\u2019s most powerful lobby groups, spending millions of dollars a year to influence lawmakers, the White House and scores of state officials on the industry\u2019s priorities.", "title": "Powerful Health Insurance Lobby's New Goal: Win Back Members", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-01-15/powerful-health-insurance-lobby-s-new-goal-win-back-members", "image": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/izmiy7Q94sX4/v1/-1x-1.jpg", "type": "website"}, "fb": {"status": "America\u2019s Health Insurance Plans is one of Washington\u2019s most powerful lobby groups, spending millions of dollars a year to influence lawmakers, the White House and scores of state officials on the industry\u2019s priorities."}, "parsely-post-id": "O0YNXX6KLVS801", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "parsely-image-url": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/izmiy7Q94sX4/v1/-1x-1.jpg"}, "_id": "\"57477afa6914bd0286fe56a8\"", "article_summary": "UnitedHealth Group Inc., the U.S.\u2019s biggest health insurer, quit the group in June over a difference in strategy.\nThat total doesn\u2019t include individual spending by companies -- UnitedHealth, for example, spent $2.6 million on lobbying in 2014.\nWin Them Back\u201cOne of our primary goals is to make sure we meet them at their space and have them rejoin AHIP,\u201d Tavenner said in an interview.\n\u201cI\u2019m going to do everything I can to win them back,\u201d Tavenner said of Aetna and UnitedHealth.\nBut companies usually realize they\u2019re better served by working together, said Dan Mendelson, president of Washington health-consulting firm Avalere Health LLC."}
