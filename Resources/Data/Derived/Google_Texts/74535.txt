Sioux Falls, SD

An Ellsworth Air Force Base pilot accused of distributing and possessing child pornography has pleaded not guilty.



U.S. Attorney Brendan Johnson says a federal grand jury indicted Capt. Michael Fech of Box Elder on Wednesday. Fech was released but ordered to wear an electronic monitor.



The 30-year-old Fech is accused of knowingly distributing and possessing computer files containing child pornography from December 2013 through June 2014.



Court documents say authorities confiscated seven computer devices from Fech.
