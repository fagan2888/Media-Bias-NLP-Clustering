House Speaker Paul Ryan is 45, earnest and energetic, a fitness buff and self-described policy wonk. He publicly spurned the speakership until his party came begging, seeking the post only once his decision to do so would seem like an act of sacrifice. Since then, he\u2019s made it part of his job to be a fixture on television, putting a smart, sunny face on modern conservatism to try to repair a tarnished Republican brand. Latest from Politics The Edge: Trump\u2019s Magic Number Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is, at 73, more than a generation older than Ryan, but the job he holds is the one he\u2019s always wanted. He\u2019s guarded, sometimes even taciturn, granting interviews only when he has a specific message to deliver. McConnell\u2019s a dealmaker, but his passion is politics, not policy. There are plenty of differences between the two men, but the one that matters most right now is when they assumed their current positions. McConnell became majority leader a year ago and immediately set a clear goal: He wanted to make the Senate function, pass bills, and show constituents that a legislative body universally condemned as dysfunctional could govern under Republican control. As even Democrats begrudgingly acknowledged, he did that. The GOP majority generally avoided crisis in 2015, and the Senate cleared bipartisan agreements on education, infrastructure, taxes, and spending. McConnell deserves credit, even if Democrats rightly complain that the deals were only there for the taking because of Republican obstruction when they were in charge.\n\nHaving pocketed those victories, McConnell wants to take it easy in 2016. Needing to protect his four-seat majority in a challenging election year for Senate Republicans, he simply wants the Senate to pass a dozen appropriations bills\u2014 a significant assignment, but one that by his own admission won\u2019t \u201ctitillate the public.\u201d McConnell\u2019s a guy who fixes the leaky sink, dusts off his hands, and just wants to sit down with a cold beer (or in his case, Kentucky bourbon.) The trouble for McConnell is that here comes Paul Ryan. \u201cWe like to think of the House and the Senate at this time as really being the think tank for conservative policy.\u201d Ryan didn\u2019t become speaker a year ago. He only took over from John Boehner in November, and spent the rest of the year finishing up his predecessor\u2019s work. He\u2019s still proving himself\u2014both to his raucous party and to the public\u2014and he sees 2016 as a critical \u201cyear of ideas,\u201d one in which Republicans must lay the groundwork for a GOP administration and build a mandate to enact conservative reform next year. \u201cOur number-one goal for the next year,\u201d Ryan said last month, \u201cis to put together a complete alternative to the Left\u2019s agenda.\u201d In other words, Ryan wants House Republicans to do much more than pass spending bills. He wants the party to develop a long-awaited replacement for Obamacare, comprehensive tax reform, and an anti-poverty agenda, to name just a few items on his wish list. For the young speaker, there\u2019s much less risk in overreaching, given that hardly anyone believes the House GOP majority is in jeopardy. The Senate is a different story. Normally, having an ambitious House speaker and a cautious Senate majority leader would be a recipe for conflict, especially between two chambers with a long history of animosity regardless of party control. And as Republicans gathered on Thursday in Baltimore for their annual policy retreat, there were hints of that tension in their public events. \u201cIt is a competition of ideas,\u201d was how Senator John Thune described it to reporters. While Ryan talked up the House\u2019s bold plans, Thune said lawmakers were aware \u201cit\u2019s an even-numbered year\u201d and noted that the looming election \u201calways make it a bit more challenging.\u201d \u201cPeople tend to go into their respective corners,\u201d Thune observed.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The two Republican leaders need to balance ambition and caution in a volatile election year in Congress.", "author": "Russell Berman", "og": {"site_name": "The Atlantic", "description": "The two Republican leaders need to balance ambition and caution in a volatile election year in Congress.", "title": "Can Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell Keep the Peace?", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2016/01/AP_736826842981/facebook.jpg?1452815078", "url": "http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/01/paul-ryan-and-mitch-mcconnell-try-to-keep-the-gop-peace/424263/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "theatlantic.com", "site": "@theatlantic", "card": "summary"}, "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "p": {"domain_verify": "68e1a0361a557708fefc992f3309ed70"}, "fb": {"admins": "577048155,17301937", "page_id": 29259828486, "app_id": 100770816677686}, "keywords": "The Atlantic, The Atlantic Magazine, TheAtlantic.com, Atlantic, news, opinion, breaking news, analysis, commentary, business, politics, culture, international, science, technology, national and life", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, width=device-width, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "House Speaker Paul Ryan is 45, earnest and energetic, a fitness buff and self-described policy wonk.\nHaving pocketed those victories, McConnell wants to take it easy in 2016.\n\u201cOur number-one goal for the next year,\u201d Ryan said last month, \u201cis to put together a complete alternative to the Left\u2019s agenda.\u201d In other words, Ryan wants House Republicans to do much more than pass spending bills.\nLatest from Politics The Edge: Trump\u2019s Magic Number Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is, at 73, more than a generation older than Ryan, but the job he holds is the one he\u2019s always wanted.\nThe trouble for McConnell is that here comes Paul Ryan."}
