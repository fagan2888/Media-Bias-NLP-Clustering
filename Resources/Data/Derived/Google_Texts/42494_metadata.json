It asked Americans whether they would be disappointed if a close family member married someone of a different race, country, political party or someone who doesn't believe in God.\n\nLess than 20% of Americans said they would be unhappy if a close family member married someone from the opposite political party and only 11% said they would be upset if that person was of a different race.\n\nBut 49% of Americans said they would be disappointed if their family member married an atheist, making nonbelievers by far the most stigmatized group in the survey.\n\nConservatives overwhelmingly held reservations about secular Americans, with 73% saying they would be less than thrilled if a family member tied the knot with a nonbeliever.\n\nSomewhat surprisingly, liberals also said they were uncomfortable with such a union. Nearly a quarter of Americans who call themselves \u201cconsistently liberal\u201d and 41% of \u201cmostly liberal\u201d respondents said they wouldn\u2019t want an atheist to marry into their family.\n\nThe poll is the latest evidence of the hard road atheists travel in the United States.\n\nAccording to separate studies, atheists are more likely to face job discrimination, political pushback and general distrust.\n\nAtheists in the Bible Belt: A survival guide\n\n\n\nDiscrimination against atheists is \u201crampant,\u201d said Dave Muscato, public relations director for American Atheists, an advocacy organization that fights for the separation of government and religion.\n\n\u201cThere is a stigma against atheism because there is so much misinformation about atheists,\u201d Muscato said in an e-mail. \u201cAtheists don't hate your god, we aren't evil, and we're nor immoral; we are simply not convinced that your god exists.\u201d\n\nOne of the most common stereotypes about atheists is they are angry white guys, said Phil Zuckerman, a professor of sociology at Pitzer College in California who has studied secularism.\n\nThe reasons for this animosity toward atheists are multifaceted, he said.\n\nFor one, religion has been a major part of American culture since the country was founded, and many Americans continue to associate nonreligiosity with immorality.\n\nFurther, thanks to practices such as the Pledge of Allegiance, many Americans associate God and religion with patriotic values and atheism with being un-American.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a stigma for being anti-black, there\u2019s a stigma for being anti-Jewish, there\u2019s a stigma for being anti-gay,\u201d Zuckerman said. \u201cThere has never been a stigma for being anti-atheist.\u201d\n\nBehold, the six types of atheists\n\nZuckerman and Muscato said that atheists need to come out of the shadows to gain more mainstream acceptance.\n\n\u201cPretty much everyone knows at least one person who's an atheist,\u201d Muscato said. \u201cThey just may not know it, because the prejudice is so strong that atheists have reasons for not talking about their atheism.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "By Sara Grossman, CNN (CNN) When Americans think of their future in-laws, they approve of nearly every type of person -- except for atheists.
