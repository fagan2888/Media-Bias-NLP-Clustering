Two people were forced out of their Tulsa home after a fire early Thursday.

Firefighters said they arrived at the home in the 500 East Tecumseh to find flames coming out the front door. The two residents were already safely outside.

Firefighters said the fire was contained to the front room. The Red Cross was called to help the residents.

Cause of the fire remains under investigation.
