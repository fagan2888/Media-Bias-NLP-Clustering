The working title is \u201cShock and Awe.\u201d On a recent Sunday Strobel and his former colleagues met for about 7 hours at the Four Seasons in Georgetown to go over the script \u201cpage by page\u201d with Reiner, his wife Michelle, financier Johnson Chan, and scriptwriter Joey Hartstone.\n\n--BACKSTORY -- Warren told Playbook: \u201cAbout 2 years ago, Rob Reiner actually called us and told us he\u2019s been wanting to do this movie for awhile and we\u2019ve been working with him and a script writer for the last two years and things have really accelerated in the last few months. ... It tells the story of how me, Landay, Walcott and Joe Galloway challenged the Bush Administration\u2019s case for war. ... The movie very much tries to show the cost of what was Bush\u2019s decision. ...\n\n\u201cThe movie does have financing, the script has been written and is being tweaked and we have every indication that this project is going to go forward. ... There is no casting yet.\u201d Strobel says he never thought at that time that there could ever be a movie made about the reporting. \u201cI think I speak for all four of us [that this] is surreal and surprising. ... We\u2019ve talked a lot and joked a lot about who might play the four of us.\u201d He also hopes to go on set for at least part of the shooting.\n\n--About the message of the film: \u201cThis has been cast often in the public sphere as an intelligence failure but I\u2019m hoping the movie will make clear that it really wasn\u2019t an intelligence failure. That these people wanted to go to war long before the intelligence was clear one way or the other. We also hope that it serves as maybe what \u2018Spotlight\u2019 did to motivate young journalists and show what investigative journalism is like and how important it is.\u201d\n\nMILESTONE -- \u201c20 Years Later, Welfare Overhaul Resonates for Families and Candidates,\u201d by Clyde Haberman for NYT\u2019s Retro Report: \u201cIn a sense, this is a \u201cBack to the Future\u2019 presidential campaign, with candidates revisiting a specific time in the past to explain \u2014 and often lament \u2014 where the country is today. ... One \u2018Back to the Future\u2019 issue from the \u201990s has received relatively scant attention, but the next president may have a hard time avoiding it, for it affects millions of Americans.
