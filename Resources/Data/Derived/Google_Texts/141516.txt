A fraternity is under fire for banners hung from a balcony of a private home.

A fraternity has suspended activities at a university chapter in Virginia after an uproar over sexually suggestive banners hung from a private home where several of that fraternity's members live.

Sigma Nu's national organization said it suspended the fraternity's activities at Old Dominion University in Norfolk pending completion of its investigation.

Old Dominion officials say they are investigating, CBS affiliate WTKR reports.

"Messages like the ones displayed yesterday by a few students on the balcony of their private residence are not and will not be tolerated," the university said in a statement.

Monday's suspension came after three large banners were draped Saturday from the balcony of a private home near the campus. The banners included one stating "Freshman Daughter Drop Off" with an arrow pointing toward the house's door. The banners stirred outrage on social media and condemnation from university officials and student leaders.

According to WTKR, Sigma Nu released a message stating their displeasure with the banners saying they condemn the "derogatory and demeaning language used on the banners."

"Such language has no place in our Fraternity or within any caring community, such as that of ODU. Any Fraternity member found to be responsible for this reprehensible display will be held accountable by the Fraternity," said Brad Beacham, Sigma Nu Fraternity's Executive Director in a statement.
