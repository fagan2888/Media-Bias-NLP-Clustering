Premiums will rise next year for about one-third of its Part B enrollees. (I\u2019ll help you decipher some of Medicare\u2019s alphabet soup below.)\n\nAnd premiums will increase for other Medicare coverage, such as some prescription drug plans.\n\n\u201cThe standalone prescription drug plans will have the most dramatic changes next year,\u201d says Margaret Reilly, program manager for a Medicare counseling service in Northern California.\n\nNow through Dec. 7 is a critical time for many of you with Medicare because it\u2019s open-enrollment season. I\u2019ll provide some tips on what to look out for.\n\nPremium Increases\n\nPart B is known as the \u201cmedical insurance\u201d portion of Medicare, and helps pay for outpatient medical care such as doctor visits, lab tests and durable medical equipment.\n\nNext year, about 30 percent of Part B enrollees will pay $121.80 (or more) instead of $104.90.\n\nHere\u2019s who will pay the higher premiums:\n\nPeople who are dually eligible for Medicare and Medicaid (called Medi-Cal in California). But Medicaid pays their premium \u2013 and the increase \u2013 on their behalf.\n\nMedicare beneficiaries who made more than $85,000 as an individual or $170,000 as a couple. This group also has to pay a surcharge depending on their income. For example, an individual who made $200,000 would have to pay a total of $316.70 per month.\n\nNew Medicare enrollees in 2016.\n\nPart B enrollees who are not receiving Social Security benefits.\n\nMedicare Advantage and Part D Open Enrollment\n\nIf you have a Medicare Advantage or Part D plan, now\u2019s the time to make changes through Dec. 7. First, a few definitions.\n\nUnlike \u201cOriginal Medicare,\u201d which is administered by the federal government, Medicare Advantage plans are offered by private companies. Medicare pays them to cover your benefits. In addition to your monthly Medicare premium, you may need to pay a premium for your Medicare Advantage plan.\n\nThey usually include prescription drug coverage.\n\nPart D plans allow you to add prescription drug benefits primarily to Original Medicare.\n\nIf you already have a Medicare Advantage or Part D plan and don\u2019t want to explore other options for next year, it could cost you.\n\nConsider that 22 of the 28 standalone Part D plans in California next year will have higher premiums, says Elaine Wong Eakin, executive director of California Health Advocates, a Medicare advocacy and education group.\n\nThe premium hikes range from 90 cents per month to \u2013 gulp \u2013 $98.70, she says. Five plans will have premium reductions and one stays the same.\n\nTo find out what\u2019s happening to your plan\u2019s premium, look at your \u201cAnnual Notice of Change,\u201d which you should have received in the mail earlier this fall. (If you didn\u2019t receive it, call your plan.)\n\nThis document also should include the plan\u2019s drug formulary, which can add or drop medications from year to year.\n\n\u201cIf the drugs you take this year are not going to be on next year\u2019s formulary, you want to know that,\u201d Reilly says.\n\nUnfortunately, the formularies can be difficult to navigate, she says, so you can also call 1-800-MEDICARE with a list of your medications, and a customer service rep can help you.\n\nAnother option is to go to the Medicare.gov website. From the home page, click on the \u201cFind health & drug plans\u201d link. You\u2019ll be able to enter the names of your drugs, as well as the dosage and frequency. In return, you\u2019ll be told which Part D plans cover your medications most economically, Reilly says.\n\nDental and Vision\n\nOriginal Medicare does not cover most dental care, including dentures. It also doesn\u2019t cover eye exams related to prescription glasses.\n\nSome Medicare Advantage plans may offer limited vision and dental coverage, but it may cost you extra. Check with your plan.\n\nIf you want these benefits and have Original Medicare, or don\u2019t get them from your Medicare Advantage plan, you\u2019ll need to buy a standalone dental or vision plan.\n\nWhich can be expensive. \u201cThere are very limited options for people on Medicare,\u201d says Jeff Album, a vice president at Delta Dental, California\u2019s largest dental insurer.\n\nAlbum offers some tips for Medicare beneficiaries looking for dental coverage:\n\nIf you\u2019re eligible for AARP, then you\u2019re also eligible for the dental insurance products it sells (including Delta Dental). Call 866-583-2085 for more information.\n\nCostco sells a Delta Dental plan to its members.\n\nYou can search for dental insurance and discount dental plans on Dentalplans.com.\n\nYou can enroll in standalone dental plans any time of year, Album says, but you often have to commit to the plan for a year and/or face a one-year waiting period for some major services.\n\nPart B Open Enrollment\n\nMost people sign up for Medicare Part A (known as the \u201chospital insurance\u201d portion) when they turn 65 because it\u2019s usually free.\n\nBut not everyone signs up for Part B right away because some may have job-based insurance. Others don\u2019t want to pay the Part B premium.\n\nIf you\u2019re over 65 and have job-based insurance, you can sign up for Part B without penalty when you retire or otherwise lose your (or your spouse\u2019s) employer-sponsored coverage. (There are some different rules for people who work for small businesses with fewer than 20 employees.)\n\nBut if you didn\u2019t have insurance and elected not to sign up at age 65, you get dinged for waiting. You have to pay a premium penalty for every year you delayed enrolling, you can only sign up for Part B from January through March each year, and your coverage won\u2019t be effective until July 1 that same year.\n\n(By the way, there are late enrollment penalties for Part D as well.)\n\nThe point is to discourage people from waiting until they\u2019re sick to enroll.\n\n\u201cSometimes people will say, \u2018I don\u2019t want to spend the money. I\u2019m not sick\u2019,\u201d Reilly says. \u201cBut when they need it, they find out the effective date isn\u2019t until July 1.\u201d\n\nTom Freker, an insurance broker in Fountain Valley, came across two women this year who have cancer, but neither had signed up for Part B when they were originally eligible.\n\nThey plan on enrolling in January. While they wait for their coverage to kick in, he says, they\u2019re trying to get as much of their cancer treatment covered by Part A as possible.\n\nUnfortunately, they face major out-of-pocket expenses. \u201cThis is costly,\u201d he warns. \u201cIt can be a real crusher.\u201d\n\nIf you\u2019re someone in this category who needs advice, or if you have other Medicare questions, there\u2019s free, one-on-one Medicare counseling available through the Health Insurance Counseling and Advocacy Program, or HICAP. Visit the California Health Advocates website at www.cahealthadvocates.org or call 800-434-0222 to find HICAP offices in your county.\n\nHICAP appointments can be hard to get during open enrollment. You can also call 1-800-MEDICARE for help.\n\n\n\nClick here to find previous Ask Emily columns.", "article_metadata": {"Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "In addition to your monthly Medicare premium, you may need to pay a premium for your Medicare Advantage plan.\nUnlike \u201cOriginal Medicare,\u201d which is administered by the federal government, Medicare Advantage plans are offered by private companies.\nMedicare Advantage and Part D Open EnrollmentIf you have a Medicare Advantage or Part D plan, now\u2019s the time to make changes through Dec. 7.\nIf you want these benefits and have Original Medicare, or don\u2019t get them from your Medicare Advantage plan, you\u2019ll need to buy a standalone dental or vision plan.\nSome Medicare Advantage plans may offer limited vision and dental coverage, but it may cost you extra."}
