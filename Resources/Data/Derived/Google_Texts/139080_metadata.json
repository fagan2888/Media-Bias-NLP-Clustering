Serious discussions about the complex and technical issues involved with transportation funding are more helpful in honestly informing Americans than simple polls.\"\n\nTolling groups in D.C. cheered when President Obama included language that would lift the current ban on states placing tolls on existing highway lanes in his proposal for a four-year, $302 billion bill that was dubbed the Grow America Act.\n\n\n\nObama\u2019s proposal would allow states to apply to the Department of Transportation for approval to install additional tolls on existing roads. Present law requires states to construct new lanes on highways that they want to toll, with the exception of pilot programs in states including Virginia, North Carolina and Missouri.\n\nThe anti-tolling group said there has been opposition in those states to expanding their use to existing highways.\n\n\"The incontrovertible facts are that citizens and lawmakers in Virginia, North Carolina, and Missouri have balked at the prospect of putting tolls on existing interstate lanes,\" the ATFI said. \"Those real world responses provide more valuable insight into the public\u2019s rejection of tolls than any poll.\"\n\n\n\nLawmakers meanwhile largely ignored Obama's transportation funding proposal, and they did not address the tolling provision in their temporary stopgap.\n\n\n\nHNTB's Ely said the poll findings that were released on Thursday showed the tolling proposal should be revisited when the transportation funding comes up for a renewal again next year.\n\n\n\n\"Inflation, improved fuel economy, changing driving habits and rising construction costs have eaten away at the purchasing power of federal and state gas taxes,\u201d he said. \u201cThe national survey suggests that many Americans agree that when it comes to fixing our Interstate system, improving trip reliability and reducing accidents, all funding sources, including tolls, should be on the table for consideration by America\u2019s transportation leaders and policy makers.\u201d\n\n-This story was updated with new information at 6:04 p.m.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.title": "Poll: 79 percent supports tolling to pay for highways", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-04T04:20-05:00", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "title": "Poll: 79 percent supports tolling to pay for highways", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/transportation/217476-poll-79-percent-support-tolling-to-pay-for-highways", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/blogs/georgewashingtonbridge_121713getty_0.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-04T04:20:37-05:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "author": "Keith Laing", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/transportation/217476-poll-79-percent-support-tolling-to-pay-for-highways", "dcterms.date": "2014-09-11T15:47-04:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Keith Laing", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Toll, Gas Tax, Highway bill, MAP-21 Reauthorization,,", "article": {"published_time": "2014-09-11T15:47:28-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-04T04:20:37-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/transportation/217476-poll-79-percent-support-tolling-to-pay-for-highways", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "card": "summary", "title": "Poll: 79 percent supports tolling to pay for highways"}}, "article_summary": "Lawmakers meanwhile largely ignored Obama's transportation funding proposal, and they did not address the tolling provision in their temporary stopgap.\nThe poll found 83 percent of its respondents would also support tolls on highways that are currently free, which has been a source of contentious debate in Washington.\nSerious discussions about the complex and technical issues involved with transportation funding are more helpful in honestly informing Americans than simple polls.\"\n\"That survey concluded two-thirds of Americans oppose a White House plan to toll existing interstates.\nHNTB's Ely said the poll findings that were released on Thursday showed the tolling proposal should be revisited when the transportation funding comes up for a renewal again next year."}
