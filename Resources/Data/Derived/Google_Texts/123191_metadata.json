(Photo: Jere Downs/The Courier-Journal)Buy Photo\n\nThe final neighborhood meeting to discuss a controversial plan to build a methane plant in a western Louisville neighborhood has been scheduled.\n\nSTAR BioEnergy CEO Steve Estes announced his company will host a Jan. 14 forum at the Kentucky Center for African American Heritage, 1701 W. Muhammad Ali Blvd., to discuss proposed changes to the project with interested residents.\n\nThe meeting is set to begin at 6 p.m., he said.\n\n\u201cThis meeting will be specifically to inform the community of the changes to the original plans and why the initial plans were altered,\u201d Estes said in a Dec. 31 letter.\n\nSTAR will also \u201cinform the community as to any other significant changes to its plans at this meeting and attempt to answer all pertinent questions,\u201d Estes said.\n\nThe city\u2019s zoning board postponed voting on the project until STAR held another community meeting after the Ft. Wayne, Ind.-based company altered parts of the project shortly before officials were asked to approve a conditional use permit.\n\nSTAR is requesting a conditional use permit from the board to build a 3,700-square-foot building along with four 44-foot-tall sealed tanks at 17th and Maple streets. The original plan had called for building just three methane tanks, however.\n\nSupporters of the plan \u2013 including Mayor Greg Fischer \u2013 have said the technology, which turn bourbon stillage and other food waste into methane gas, is an important green energy project that would benefit the city. But a growing grassroots movement made of California neighborhood leaders and other residents have opposed building the $32 million facility at that location, citing safety and health concerns.\n\nMetro Council President David Tandy, who was initially OK with the project, said in recent weeks it would be better to build the facility at the city\u2019s landfill as a test site before placing the methane plant in such a densely residential neighborhood.\n\nThe zoning board is scheduled to reconsider STAR's permit request at its Jan. 21 meeting.\n\nReporter Phillip M.
