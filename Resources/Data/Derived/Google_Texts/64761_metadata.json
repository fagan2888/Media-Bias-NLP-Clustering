For openers, I took it before former Virginia Gov. Jim Gilmore announced his presidential bid, and as this is written, the webmasters have not added him to the list of possible ideal matches. For all I know, Gilmore could be a game-changer.\n\nOr not.\n\nAnyway, at this early moment in the campaign, I am most aligned with ... Marco Rubio. That\u2019s right. The junior U.S. senator from Florida.\n\nI was surprised, initially, by this outcome. My sense of the 2016 election, then and now, is the Republican nominee should emerge from its stable of past and present state governors, not simply because they tend to make superior candidates, but because, after eight years of Barack Obama\u2019s uncompromising demagoguery, the nation will need a president who knows, from Day One, the weight of public-policy decision-making.\n\nAn absence of such experience in Rubio\u2019s resume probably goes a long way toward explaining why the two of us are so philosophically suitable. Like me, he has not had to endure the consequences of being The Decider.\n\nThis does not mean I could not make a spirited defense of his White House aspirations. Rubio, by word and deed, makes plain that his forward-looking vision of an America renewed and flourishing is deeply rooted in its traditions: limited government that places individual self-determination first among domestic virtues and a projection of no-nonsense strength abroad.\n\nRubio has demonstrated, also, in the wake of his perplexing role in the Senate\u2019s \u201cGang of Eight\u201d immigration debacle, he learns quickly. No longer a fan of so-called \u201ccomprehensive reform,\u201d Rubio begins with securing the national borders. And then? We\u2019ll see. Perfect.\n\nHowever, those infected by Trumpmania notwithstanding, it is not nearly enough for a candidate to share our views on a basket of current concerns. He \u2014 or she \u2014 must have demonstrated a temperament for leadership. On that front, Rubio is insufficiently tested. Also on that front, being famous for growling, \u201cYou\u2019re fired!\u201d also is not a CV-enhancer.\n\nHappily, closely trailing Rubio on my issues scorecard are precisely those I would expect to see, all in a statistical tie: Scott Walker, Rick Perry and \u2014 despite rejecting with vigor and prejudice the poll\u2019s question on common core \u2014 Jeb Bush. Successful governors all, with track records of facing down formidable, entrenched opposition, and doing so without abandoning certain core conservative principles (such as throwing open the gates to fiduciary ruin by expanding Medicaid under Obamacare, and then \u2014 hello, John Kasich \u2014 getting all preachy about it).\n\nCould I live with a GOP ticket that had any of my top three governors at the top and Rubio as the veep? (The way around the Electoral College problem for a Jeb-Marco pairing goes through Maine, by the way.)
