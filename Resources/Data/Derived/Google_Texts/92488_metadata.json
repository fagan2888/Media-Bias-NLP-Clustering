An announcement last month that the City of Pittsburgh will self-insure more than 3,000 workers and retirees put a spotlight on the idea in Western Pennsylvania.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a definite subset savings of money when you go self-funded. That\u2019s clear,\u201d said Rick Galardini, CEO at JRG Advisors benefits consulting firm based in Wexford.\n\nHe estimated some companies might shave more than 10 percent from projected health insurance expenses by choosing the self-funded approach \u2014 in which they cover medical claims themselves \u2014 instead of a fully insured set-up. The fully insured method leaves the bulk of risk with health insurers, which pay the claims in exchange for premiums and other fees.\n\nConsultants and insurers said companies with as few as 25 to 50 workers are exploring self-funded programs and could make that switch by October 2016, when some fully insured plans grandfathered under the health law would need to comply and meet a new variety of minimum standards, including coverage for substance abuse care and medical laboratory services.\n\nThose fully insured plans also face regulations and taxes that can amount to more than 3.5 percent of premiums, according to the Brookings Institution in Washington, D.C. Employers can bypass many of those blanket requirements and customize their coverage plans by flipping to self-funding, Mr. Galardini said.\n\nBenefiting from large numbers\n\nStill, analysts at two Washington, D.C.-based research groups said it\u2019s too soon to say whether the health law will push companies away from fully insured plans. Self-funding has gained favor with employers at least since the late 1990s, although most of that growth emerged from large organizations with at least 1,000 workers each, according to the Employee Benefit Research Institute.\n\nThe institute reported 58 percent of workers with health coverage were in self-insured plans as of 2013, up from 41 percent in 1998. About 65 percent of firms with at least 50 workers offered at least one self-insured plan, while 13 percent of smaller firms did so, the institute noted.\n\nBig organizations benefit from large numbers, said Paul Fronstin, director of the health research and education program at the institute. \u201cThey basically act like their own insurance company when they self-insure. When you\u2019re large, you can do that. When you\u2019re small, you can\u2019t. Or it\u2019s much harder to do.\u201d\n\nWhile sizable employers with self-funded coverage often rely on insurers to administer benefit plans and process claims, the employers can pay the claims themselves because they spread the financial risk over large pools of enrollees.\n\nThe risk can be steeper for small organizations because they have fewer participants paying in, which can leave a company with more modest reserves to cover rare, expensive medical cases.\n\n\u201cYou start getting down into employers of 50 employees, 100 employees \u2014 they have to protect themselves from large claims. If they get a $1 million claim, that can be catastrophic to that organization,\u201d said Anthony Benevento, a senior vice president at Downtown-based insurer Highmark Inc.\n\nMitigating risk\n\nThe City of Pittsburgh and other self-insured employers have mitigated that hazard through an extra policy known as stop-loss coverage, an insurer-provided plan that caps an organization\u2019s medical payouts at a pre-set figure. Mayor Bill Peduto\u2019s administration announced in October that the city would return to a self-funded approach for roughly 3,700 workers and retirees, a move forecast to prevent about $7 million in additional expenses in 2016.\n\nHealth spending will still increase for the city, just not as much as it would have without self-funded insurance, said Sam Ashbaugh, director of the city\u2019s Office of Management and Budget. It wasn\u2019t immediately clear last week how much of the savings \u2014 if any \u2014 might stem from nuances under the health law.\n\n\u201cThis is not just about how much we spend on health care. From the mayor\u2019s perspective, it\u2019s how healthy are our employees?\u201d said Mr. Ashbaugh.\n\nHe said the city will double an incentive to encourage workers to undergo a biometric screening and wellness profile, including height and weight measurements, that promote better health and lower costs.\n\nSelf-insurance can make it easier for employers to analyze such incentives, health care usage rates and other data to fine-tune their coverage plans, said Jessica Brooks, president and CEO of the Pittsburgh Business Group on Health. She said some sectors, including public entities and manufacturers, have begun looking more closely at the approach.\n\nAt Highmark, Mr. Benevento said employers with around 200 to 1,000 workers are weighing the self-funding option, long a standard for companies with more than 2,000 employees. He said Highmark, the largest health insurer in Pennsylvania, does not try to steer customers one way or another.\n\n\u201cWe try to give them all the information to make the right decision they need as the employer. From our perspective, we are happy to provide them with either fully insured or self-funded,\u201d Mr. Benevento said.\n\nEither way, analysts said insurance enrollees are unlikely to see little practical difference between a self-funded policy and a similar one that\u2019s fully insured.\n\nA self-funded plan generally drops conventional premiums but replaces them with other participation fees that may carry the \u201cpremium\u201d label, they said.\n\n\u201cEveryone should at least be evaluating that option,\u201d Mrs. Brooks said.\n\nAdam Smeltz: asmeltz@post-gazette.com, 412-263-2625 or on Twitter @asmeltz.", "article_metadata": {"description": "An announcement that the City of Pittsburgh will self-insure more than 3,000 workers and retirees put a spotlight on the idea in Western Pa.", "og": {"site_name": "Pittsburgh Post-Gazette", "description": "For even the smallest businesses, pledging to pay workers\u2019 medical bills straight from company funds can be a $1 million risk \u2014 a high-stakes bet that might pad or prune the balance sheet.
