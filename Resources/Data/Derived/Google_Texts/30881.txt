DENVER (AP) – Nationally syndicated Christian radio broadcaster James Dobson is suing the federal government over a requirement in the Affordable Care Act that his ministry must include the morning-after pill and other emergency contraception in its health insurance.

Dobson’s lawsuit, filed Tuesday in Denver federal court, says the requirement violates the religious beliefs of his Colorado Springs-based ministry, called Family Talk.

More than 60 lawsuits are challenging the requirement, including one filed by Hobby Lobby Inc.

Dobson is founder and president of Family Talk, which has a radio show, newsletter and website. The lawsuit says the ministry has 28 full-time employees, and its insurance covers 60 people, including employees’ family members.

Dobson is best known as founder of the conservative Focus on the Family ministry. He left that group and launched Family Talk in 2010.
