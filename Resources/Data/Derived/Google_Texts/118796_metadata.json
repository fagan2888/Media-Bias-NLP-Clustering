Each 'app' seems very impressive.\n\nIt appears that the IC has created secured versions of the most popular apps around, suggesting that an officer's phone looks like a secure version of that carried by a regular person.\n\n\n\nCreated by the intelligence field's Chief Information Officer, the presentation states that Intelink was created in 1994, making it the earliest government use of the World Wide Web.\n\nAccording to the slides, Intelink pioneered the culture shift from \u201cneed to know\u201d to a \u201cneed to share\u201d (years before 9/11).\n\nWhen it says \"everyone Community-wide can connect in a shared space,\" the community includes all of these customers, users, and partnerships: Basically, Intelink appears to be an amazingly secure and extensive network for communication through multiple mediums.\n\nThat makes sense \u2014 since the Internet was invented for military information sharing purposes \u2014 but it does make one wonder why public networks are not more secure.\n\nIn 2010 Google asked the NSA to help secure its network, but this week we found out that the NSA infiltrated Google's cloud system.\n\nThe situation creates the impression that the U.S. government could help public companies protect the user information they handle, but choose instead to insert secret backdoors into chips and other hardware and commercial software to aid surveillance efforts.\n\nOn the other hand, the IC cannot give up the mechanisms for its Top Secret network or else Intelink will be useless. So like other military inventions that have reached the public (e.g. GPS), the public must be a few steps behind.\n\nInterestingly, the interaction of those two perspectives is central to the current debate created by the disclosures facilitated by Edward Snowden.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#185f7c", "sailthru.author": "Michael B Kelley", "application-name": "Business Insider", "twitter": {"description": "The U.S. intelligence community (IC) developed...", "creator": "MichaelBKelley", "url": "http://www.businessinsider.com/the-us-intelligence-community-internet-2013-11", "image": "http://static5.businessinsider.com/image/527417d469bedd027bafe9a4-506-253/the-us-intelligence-community-has-a-secret-internet-that-is-much-more-secure-than-ours.jpg", "title": "The US Intelligence Community Has A Secret Internet That Is Much More Secure Than Ours", "site": "BI_Defense", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.verticals": "defense,politics,sai,international,law", "linkedin": {"owner": "mid:1d5f7b"}, "sailthru.tags": "Spying, Internet, NSA, Michael B Kelley", "description": "The U.S. intelligence community (IC) developed...", "author": "Michael B Kelley", "sailthru.date": "2013-11-02", "sailthru.title": "The US Intelligence Community Has A Secret Internet That Is Much More Secure Than Ours", "theme-color": "#185f7c", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://static4.businessinsider.com/image/5274088fecad04b832b86b39-50-50/the-us-intelligence-community-has-a-secret-internet-that-is-much-more-secure-than-ours.jpg", "news_keywords": "Spying, Internet, NSA, Michael B Kelley", "tbi-image": "http://static3.businessinsider.com/image/5274088fecad04b832b86b39/the-us-intelligence-community-has-a-secret-internet-that-is-much-more-secure-than-ours.jpg", "fb": {"app_id": 155043519637}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://static1.businessinsider.com/assets/images/us/favicons/mstile-144x144.png?v=BI-US-2016-03-31", "date": "2013-11-02", "article": {"publisher": "businessinsider", "author": "http://www.businessinsider.com/author/michael-b-kelley"}, "sailthru.description": "The U.S. intelligence community (IC) developed...", "viewport": "width=1024", "og": {"site_name": "Business Insider", "description": "The U.S. intelligence community (IC) developed...", "title": "The US Intelligence Community Has A Secret Internet That Is Much More Secure Than Ours", "url": "http://www.businessinsider.com/the-us-intelligence-community-internet-2013-11", "image": "http://static1.businessinsider.com/image/527417d469bedd027bafe9a4-1190-625/the-us-intelligence-community-has-a-secret-internet-that-is-much-more-secure-than-ours.jpg", "type": "article"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Business Insider", "title": "The US Intelligence Community Has A Secret Internet That Is Much More Secure Than Ours", "sailthru.image.full": "http://static3.businessinsider.com/image/5274088fecad04b832b86b39/the-us-intelligence-community-has-a-secret-internet-that-is-much-more-secure-than-ours.jpg", "tbi-vertical": "defense"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3789\"", "article_summary": "The U.S. intelligence community (IC) developed a secure, internal network version of Twitter called eChirp that allows its analysts to discuss breaking news across agencies, David Nakamura of The Washington Post reports.\nCreated by the intelligence field's Chief Information Officer, the presentation states that Intelink was created in 1994, making it the earliest government use of the World Wide Web.\nThat makes sense \u2014 since the Internet was invented for military information sharing purposes \u2014 but it does make one wonder why public networks are not more secure.\nAn IC presentation from 2010 notes that eChirp had 11,569 users and 99,723 \"CHIRPs\" at the time.\nThe eChirp platform is one of a suite of services \u2014 collectively called Intelink \u2014 the IC offers."}
