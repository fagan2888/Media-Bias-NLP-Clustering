Are You One Of Them?\n\nBecause everyone else is. Even Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 is on this list.\n\nJERUSALEM \u2014 Israeli Prime Minishttp://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-admin/post-new.phpter Benjamin Netanyahu is having a bad week. Problems are literally dropping from the sky \u2014 in the case of the missiles in Southern Israel \u2014 but they\u2019re also popping up in Netanyahu\u2019s own household, in his scandal-ridden cabinet, and in the crucial ties between Jerusalem and Washington. Here\u2019s the comprehensive list of everything that Israel, but in particular Netanyahu, has to worry about right now.\n\n1. His wife is in hot water \u2014 again\n\n\n\nofficial MintPress sponsor official MintPress sponsor\n\nMeni Naftali, the former chief steward of Netanyahu\u2019s official residence, has filed a lawsuit against the first couple, claiming exploitation and a severe abridgement of his basic rights. Asking for over a million dollars, Naftali claims, \u201cThe Netanyahu family treated me in a patronizing and condescending way, the worst part being the uncontrollable tongue-lashings by the prime minister\u2019s wife, Sara Netanyahu.\u201d The alleged abuse includes 3 a.m. screaming fits directed against Naftali by Mrs. Netanyahu \u2014 once again dubbed \u201cIsrael\u2019s Marie Antoinette.\u201d\n\n2. His ministers are in hot water \u2014 again\n\nDefense Minister Moshe Ya\u2019alon was forced to apologize to the US government for the second time in two months. In January, speaking at a private forum he claimed not to know was being recorded, Ya\u2019alon criticized Secretary of State John Kerry for being \u201cinexplicably obsessive\u201d and \u201cmessianic.\u201d On Monday, Ya\u2019alon, who seems blissfully unaware that his position does not afford anything resembling privacy, once again spoke to a closed forum, members of which wasted no time in leaking his comments that the American position vis-\u00e0-vis Iran \u201cis weak.\u201d In his latest apology, Ya\u2019alon said he had \u201cno intention to damage Israel-US relations.\u201d\n\n3. Israel\u2019s northern border is a mess\n\nIsrael may be unable to keep away from the Syrian civil war, now in its fourth year, which crept significantly closer this week. Four Israeli soldiers were wounded on Tuesday when a bomb hit their jeep near the Syrian border, in the Golan Heights. Early Wednesday, Israel bombed several Syrian military targets, killing one and wounding at least seven. The prime minister declared: Israel\u2019s \u201cpolicy is clear. We hurt those who hurt us.\u201d Israeli soldiers have started training to be ready in the event of an escalation.\n\n4. Israel\u2019s southern border is a mess\n\nIn the past week, Israel has been hit by close to a hundred missiles launched from Gaza. The barrage was the first significant breach of the cease-fire between Hamas and Israel that Egypt brokered 16 months ago, and came less than a week after Israel intercepted the Klos C, a ship carrying hundreds of Syrian-made, Iranian-sold missiles on a circuitous course to Gaza \u2014 where extremist groups from Hamas to Islamic Jihad were battling for the spoils.\n\n5. Israel\u2019s other southern border, with Egypt\u2019s Sinai peninsula, is a mess\n\nWith the Sinai increasingly lawless and, like Gaza, overrun by competing extremist factions, Israel found itself pleading this week with Washington not to cancel the delivery of 10 Apache helicopters that are part of American aid to Egypt. Israel doesn\u2019t want anything to get in the way of the Egyptian military\u2019s efforts to subdue Islamic militants in the Sinai.\n\n6. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas got a long-sought White House visit\n\nWhile in DC, Abbas reiterated Palestine\u2019s adamant refusal to accept Israel\u2019s demand it be recognized as a \u201cJewish State,\u201d and threatened once again, if negotiations fail, to turn to international organizations for recognition. (In further ministerial trouble, Israel\u2019s deputy minister of defense, Danny Danon, announced this week he will resign if the next planned step of the peace process actually takes place: a release of Palestinian prisoners scheduled for next week.)\n\n7. Israel\u2019s contested capital city is heating up\n\nThere have been three clashes this week following visits of right-wing Israeli parliamentarians to the Temple Mount \u2014 or, as Muslims call it, the Esplanade of the Mosques. The visits to the site held as sacred by Jews and Muslims are entirely legal, but are viewed as a provocation by Palestinian Jerusalemites.\n\n8. Scandals are erupting left, right and center\u2026\n\n\u2026 and each in its own way is threatening Netanyahu\u2019s fragile political coalition. In one, the former army spokesman and several senior aides to the IDF\u2019s then-chief of staff are accused of spying on the minister of defense at the time. In another, a former prime minster and erstwhile Netanyahu ally, Ehud Olbert, is on trial for corruption. In yet another, the Israeli chief rabbinate, a quasi-independent government-funded body, faces an existential crisis due to its hard-line refusal to grant foreign-born converts the status of Jews. American Jews faced with this edict are not pleased.\n\n9. You know that missing Malaysian plane?\n\nMH370 is giving Israel the jitters \u2014 big time. Israel has a bitter history with airplane hijackings. Since the disappearance of the Malaysian flight, it is demanding that foreign flights identify themselves earlier than usual, with more specific detail than before, when approaching Israeli airspace.\n\nThe good news? Quinoa has been deemed Kosher for Passover. Yes. Really.\n\nThis article was published by Global Post.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Here\u2019s the comprehensive list of everything that Israel, but in particular Netanyahu, has to worry about right now", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "AUTHOR": "Noga Tarnopolsky", "og": {"site_name": "MintPress News", "description": "Here\u2019s the comprehensive list of everything that Israel, but in particular Netanyahu, has to worry about right now", "title": "Israel's Got 99 problems.
