They are still puzzled by it.\n\nPossibilities include a number of exotic astrophysical objects like mergers of neutron star, evaporating black holes or flares from magnetars which are a kind of neutron star with very powerful magnetic fields.\n\n\"Another possibility is that they are bursts much brighter than the giant pulses seen from some pulsars\", said James Cordes, a professor of astronomy at Cornell University in the US.\n\nThe discovery was made as a part of the Pulsar Arecibo L-Band Feed Array (PALFA) survey which basically aims to find a large sample of pulsars and also to discover rare objects which are useful for better understanding the physics of neutron star and testing theories of gravitational physics.", "article_metadata": {}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd146\"", "article_summary": "A burst for a split second of radio waves has been discovered by scientists by making use of the Arecibo radio telescope in Puerto Rico which provides important evidence of mysterious pulses that seem to come from deeper space.\nPossibilities include a number of exotic astrophysical objects like mergers of neutron star, evaporating black holes or flares from magnetars which are a kind of neutron star with very powerful magnetic fields.\nThe finding marks the first time that a \"fast radio burst\" has been detected by an international team of astronomers using an instrument other than the Parkes radio telescope in Australia.\nExactly what may be causing these radio bursts is a major mystery for astrophysicists.\nThe international team of scientists confirmed previous estimates that these strange cosmic bursts occurred almost 10,000 times a day over the whole sky."}
