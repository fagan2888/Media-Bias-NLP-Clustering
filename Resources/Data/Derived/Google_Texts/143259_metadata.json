Besides making workers responsible for more of their care, employers hope these plans will motivate employees to comparison-shop for medical services \u2014 an admirable goal but one that some say is hard to achieve.\n\nSeveral big companies started offering consumer-driven plans as their only option in the last couple of years, including JPMorgan, Wells Fargo, General Electric and Honeywell, among others; it is the only choice for Bank of America employees earning more than $100,000.\n\nNext year, nearly a third of large employers will offer only high-deductible plans \u2014 up from 22 percent in 2014 and 10 percent in 2010, according to a study by the National Business Group on Health, which included 136 large companies that collectively employ 7.5 million workers. And 81 percent of those large employers will have added one of these plans to their lineup of choices, up from 53 percent in 2010.\n\nRead MorePennsylvania to expand Medicaid under Obamacare\n\nWith high-deductible health plans, consumers pay for all their medical services \u2014 at the insurer's negotiated rate \u2014 until they meet their deductible. After that, consumers typically pay coinsurance, which is a percentage of each service \u2014 say 10 to 35 percent \u2014 until they reach the out-of-pocket maximum.\n\n\n\nThat is scheduled to be generally capped at $6,450 for singles and $12,900 for families in 2015, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation, and includes items like deductibles, coinsurance and co-payments, but not premiums, which tend to be lower in these plans.\n\n\n\nSo it is easy to see how shopping for an M.R.I. of the lower back \u2014 which can range from roughly $415 to $4,530 \u2014 would suddenly pay off for both the employee and the employer.\n\n\n\n\"There are different approaches to cost containment,\" said Professor Ginsburg. \"One is having a lot of skin in the game, or just having to pay for a lot of your health care.\"\n\n\n\nInsurers and independent providers, including Castlight and Healthcare Bluebook, offer tools that help consumers estimate their costs and the quality of the providers. But shopping around can still be challenging.\n\n\n\n\"Castlight and others like it make a valiant effort to provide price and quality information,\" said Uwe E. Reinhardt, a health policy expert and professor at Princeton.\n\n\n\n\"But the question is whether the prices they give you are binding. To really shop around effectively, prospective patients need binding prices.\"\n\n\n\nRead MoreThe problem with health-care cost transparency\n\n\n\nCastlight \u2014 working with more than 130 large employers \u2014 provides consumers with tools that offer personalized pricing and quality information for services within their insurer's network. But even the most diligent shoppers can run into problems.\n\n\n\n\"They may have done everything right,\" said Dr. Dena Bravata, Castlight's chief medical officer. \"They may have picked an in-network gastroenterologist for a colonoscopy. But then you don't know if you need to have a biopsy, which then goes to a lab or pathologist who is out of network.\"\n\n\n\nAnd using the tools can simply be impractical in certain circumstances. \"Most health care costs are incurred by very sick patients, such as those with heart attacks, strokes, cancer, mental illness, injuries \u2014 often under emergency conditions,\" said Sara Collins, vice president for health care coverage and access at the Commonwealth Fund.\n\n\n\nAnother concern is that some people will be ill prepared to handle large bills, and will forgo care as a result. \"If you go to the pharmacy and there is a $1,000 deductible on your drug benefit, they aren't going to write you a five-year loan,\" said Karen Pollitz, a senior fellow at Kaiser.\n\n\n\nHigh-deductible plans are often used with health savings accounts. As long as the plan deductibles in 2015 exceed $1,300 for single people or $2,600 for families, and meet other criteria, employers and workers can deposit money into the H.S.A.; in 2015, individuals will be allowed to contribute up to $3,350 in pretax dollars (or $6,650 for family coverage). The money grows tax-free and can be used to pay for out-of-pocket health care expenses. (Health reimbursement accounts can also be used, but those are largely controlled by employers, and workers cannot keep the money if they leave.)\n\n\n\nThe National Business Group on Health's study found that the vast majority of large employers make deposits. But Kaiser's 2013 survey, which covers both small and large employers, found that about half of employers do not fund these accounts. Of those that do, Kaiser found they deposit $950 for singles with health savings accounts, on average, and $1,680 for families.\n\n\n\nKaiser also found that the average deductible for single people in a high-deductible plan paired with a health savings account was $2,098 in 2013, while it was about $4,037, in aggregate, for families.", "article_metadata": {"AssetType": "partnerstory", "description": "Just as employers replaced pensions with retirement plans, more companies appear to be making a similar cost-sharing shift with health plans.", "author": "Tara Siegel Bernard", "og": {"site_name": "CNBC", "description": "Just as employers replaced pensions with retirement plans, more companies appear to be making a similar cost-sharing shift with health plans.", "title": "High health deductibles weigh down more workers", "url": "http://www.cnbc.com/2014/09/02/high-health-plan-deductibles-weigh-down-more-employees.html", "image": "http://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2014/08/11/101910343-137305700.1910x1000.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Just as employers replaced pensions with retirement plans, more companies appear to be making a similar cost-sharing shift with health plans.", "title": "High Health Plan Deductibles Weigh Down More Employees", "url": "http://www.cnbc.com/2014/09/02/high-health-plan-deductibles-weigh-down-more-employees.html", "image": {"src": "http://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2014/08/11/101910343-137305700.1910x1000.jpg"}, "site": "@CNBC", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "al": {"ios": {"app_name": "CNBC Business News and Finance", "app_store_id": 398018310}}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=398018310", "GOOGLEBOT": "unavailable_after: 31 Dec 9999 23:59:59 GMT", "keywords": "Health Care, Health Care, Personal Finance, US: News, JPMorgan Chase and Co, Wells Fargo & Co, General Electric Co, Honeywell International Inc, Bank of America Corp, business news", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/cnbc", "published_time": "2014-09-02T08:46:36-0400", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/CNBC", "section": "Health Care", "modified_time": "2014-09-02T08:57:10-0400", "tag": "Bank of America Corp"}, "pageNodeId": 101962869, "news_keywords": "Health care plan deductible, health care costs, high health care deductible plan"}, "article_summary": "Of those that do, Kaiser found they deposit $950 for singles with health savings accounts, on average, and $1,680 for families.\n\"Most health care costs are incurred by very sick patients, such as those with heart attacks, strokes, cancer, mental illness, injuries \u2014 often under emergency conditions,\" said Sara Collins, vice president for health care coverage and access at the Commonwealth Fund.\nRead MorePennsylvania to expand Medicaid under ObamacareWith high-deductible health plans, consumers pay for all their medical services \u2014 at the insurer's negotiated rate \u2014 until they meet their deductible.\nJust as employers replaced pensions with retirement savings plans, more large companies appear to be in a similar cost-sharing shift with health plans.\nThe National Business Group on Health's study found that the vast majority of large employers make deposits."}
