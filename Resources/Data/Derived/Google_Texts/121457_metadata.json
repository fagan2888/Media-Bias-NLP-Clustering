But it was nevertheless traumatic and I experienced a few extra provincial-bred shudders. Oh, Kurt Sutter, why, oh why, did you have to set the shooting in Stockton? Hasn\u2019t that beleaguered Central California city been through enough?\n\nFull disclosure: I grew up in Stockton and attended a Catholic school like the one depicted in the show. I also have sad memories of a real-life grade-school shooting that took place in Stockton long before Columbine \u2014 in 1989 \u2014 that killed five students and wounded 29 at Cleveland Elementary. So this sequence naturally hit home.\n\nBut I digress. It will be interesting to see what kind of reaction the jarring plot twist provokes in chat rooms and on blogs \u2014 whether fans felt it went over the line or not. In some ways, it felt like it ceased being a \u201cSOA\u201d episode.\n\nSutter, of course, knew it would be a point of contention. At this summer\u2019s TV critics\u2019s press tour he addressed why he chose to go there:\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve wanted to do that story for about three years,\u201d he said. \u201cObviously, I knew that it would be somewhat controversial, but I feel like, as much as I wouldn\u2019t do something because it was controversial, I\u2019m also not going to do something because it\u2019s controversial. I feel like it\u2019s an organic story to our world, in terms of it being what these guys do. I feel like, thematically, it\u2019s the right fit because we have a lead character that\u2019s a father who\u2019s trying to figure out if he can raise his sons and avoid the kind of violence that happens.\n\n\u201cSo, that will continue to play out. There\u2019s a lot of blood and guts in my show. It is a signature of the show, but nothing is done gratuitously. The events that happen in the premiere are really the catalyst for the third act of this morality play that we\u2019re doing.\u201d\n\nI\u2019ve already seen the next two \u201cSOA\u201d episodes and the shooting does, indeed, continue to have an impact on the story line. It\u2019s interesting to see Jax\u2019s reaction to it, and exactly how it affects his decisions as SAMCRO leader.\n\nBut that\u2019s still to come. For now, what was your reaction to the gut wrenching plot twist? Did you think it went too far? Or did you approve of the way Sutter and director Paris Barclay handled it? And what did you think of the rest of the episode?", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "\u2018Sons of Anarchy\u2019 recap: Did shocking plot twist go too far?", "title": "\u2018Sons of Anarchy\u2019 recap: Did shocking plot twist go too far?", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2013/09/11/sons-of-anarchy-recap-did-shocking-plot-twist-go-too-far/", "image": {"width": 214, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20130911__ee19325b-101f-47ac-b563-59473c66fe89p1.jpg", "height": 317}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20130911__ee19325b-101f-47ac-b563-59473c66fe89p1.jpg?w=1400", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2013-09-11T08:47:10+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-28T16:56:19+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3c33\"", "article_summary": "For now, what was your reaction to the gut wrenching plot twist?\nIt will be interesting to see what kind of reaction the jarring plot twist provokes in chat rooms and on blogs \u2014 whether fans felt it went over the line or not.\nBut the one plot twist that will certainly draw the most attention is the school shooting that went down in the final moments of the episode, recalling horrific memories of Sandy Hook, Columbine and other such tragic nightmares.\nOh, Kurt Sutter, why, oh why, did you have to set the shooting in Stockton?\nFull disclosure: I grew up in Stockton and attended a Catholic school like the one depicted in the show."}
