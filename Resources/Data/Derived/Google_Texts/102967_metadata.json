Photo by Jason Redmond for Reuters.\n\nA high school student believed to have shot to death a classmate and wounded four others on Friday at his campus north of Seattle was a popular homecoming prince but appeared on social media as a heart broken and sometimes angry adolescent.\n\nPolice offered no motive for why Jaylen Fryberg, a freshman at Marysville-Pilchuck High School in Marysville, walked into his school cafeteria and shot his fellow students.\n\nRebecca Cooley, the mother of a boy at the school, said Frysberg was a well-known football player who recently was on the homecoming court at the school.\n\nHis Twitter feed, however, hints at a disappointment of some sort over the past week.\n\n\u201cIt won\u2019t last\u2026. It\u2019ll never last\u2026.,\u201d read Fryberg\u2019s last tweet, from Thursday.\n\nIn the three days leading up to that, he sent a series of tweets suggesting he was going through a painful breakup.\n\n\u201cI should have listened\u2026. You were right\u2026 The whole time you were right\u2026,\u201d said one tweet.\n\nAnother said: \u201cIt breaks me\u2026 It actually does\u2026 I know it seems like I\u2019m sweating it off\u2026 But I\u2019m not.. And I never will be able to..\u201d\n\nAnd in a pair of tweets in August, Fryberg appeared to display an angry side.\n\n\u201cYour gonna piss me off .. And then some sh*ts gonna go down and I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll like it \u2026 Your not gonna like what happens next,\u201d he wrote.\n\nFryberg\u2019s Facebook page shows a happier side: photos of him with unidentified girls, posing with a rifle and a slain deer on a hunting trip, and on a boat with Orca whales swimming close behind.\n\nSuch images are not out of the ordinary for the coastal area where he lived, in Tulalip Bay, Washington, some seven miles northwest of Marysville.\n\nPhotos on Fryberg\u2019s Facebook page also shows he was active in sports and played football and basketball, and that he was a member of, and worked for, the Tulalip Tribes, a native American organization which operates two casinos and an outlet mall.\n\n(Reporting by Bill Rigby; Additional reporting by Victoria Cavaliere in Marysville, Writing by Alex Dobuzinskis; Editing by Sandra Maler)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": {"width": 800, "identifier": "http://www.rawstory.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/REUTERS-DO-NOT-REUSE46-800x430.jpg", "height": 430}, "title": "\u2018Some sh*ts gonna go down\u2019: Wash.
