Ascension is the parent company of Warren-based St. John Providence Health System, a five-hospital system, and nine other hospitals in Michigan.\n\nAn Ascension spokesman in St. Louis declined further comment until the deal is completed.\n\nJoseph Aoun, health care lawyer with Nuyen, Tomtishen and Aoun PC in Ann Arbor, said the acquisition of USHL will provide Together Health Network LLC, a physician-led clinically integrated network, with the ability to participate in the state\u2019s health insurance exchange with its narrow provider network.\n\nUSHL\u2019s target market is small employers with less than 100 employees. It has received approval from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to sell various policies for small employers under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nTogether Health is owned by two of the nation\u2019s largest health care systems, Ascension Health and Livonia-based Trinity Health. The two systems own 27 hospitals with more than 5,000 physicians on medical staffs in Michigan.\n\n\u201cThe acquisition makes a lot of sense,\u201d Aoun said. \u201cHospitals are now expected to manage population health and owning a health plan provides both infrastructure and a way to connect more directly with insurance purchasers.\u201d\n\nIn 2013, USHL reported $67.4 million in net premium, about half of which was from Michigan. Its surplus was approximately $8 million. USHL is also affiliated with Automated Benefits Services Inc., a Michigan third-party administrator, according to documents filed with the insurance department on Jan. 14.\n\nThe proposed acquisition of USHL will be through a newly formed subsidiary, Ascension Care Management LLC, which states its \u201cprimary business is to own and operate businesses that are part of the population health management platform of Ascension.\u201d\n\nTony Tersigni, Ascension's CEO, is one of three directors of Ascension Care Management. The other two are top Ascension executives, CFO Anthony Speranzo and Joseph Impicciche, general counsel.\n\nAfter the acquisition, USHL will be a wholly-owned subsidiary of U.S. Health Holdings Ltd., a Michigan-based corporation.\n\nJay Greene: (313) 446-0325, jgreene@crain.com.
