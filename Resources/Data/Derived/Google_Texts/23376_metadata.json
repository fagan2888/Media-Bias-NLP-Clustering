John McCain, giving the Democrats the strongest candidate they\u2019ve ever run against the veteran senator.\n\nThe three-term congresswoman from Arizona\u2019s sprawling 1st Congressional District announced her candidacy Monday morning, telling supporters in an email, \u201cI\u2019m in for Senate.\u201d In a video posted on her new U.S. Senate campaign website, the Arizona native touted her rural roots, saying she\u2019ll fight for her state.\n\nI love this state. I\u2019ve lived my whole life here,\u201d she said in the video. \u201cIn Congress, I\u2019ve been working hard to put Arizona first, help create a strong, diverse economy, improve education, look out for Arizona\u2019s farms, ranches and natural beauty, take care of our veterans, pay down our debt, protect Social Security and Medicare, and make Washington play by the same rules as everyone else.\u201d\n\nThe announcement answers a long-running question of who, if anyone, the Democrats would run against McCain as he seeks a sixth term. With the Legislature preparing for possible redistricting of congressional map, many viewed Kirkpatrick\u2019s Democratic colleague, Congresswoman Kyrsten Sinema, as a possibility. But Kirkpatrick\u2019s announcement caught the political world by surprise.\n\nSources said Kirkpatrick didn\u2019t inform people of her decision until Monday. Even members of Arizona\u2019s congressional delegation were caught off-guard.\n\nKirkpatrick represents a highly competitive district and has won tough races before. After losing her first re-election in 2010, she came back in 2012 and won a hard-fought race that, even going into Election Day, many expected her to lose to Republican nominee Jonathan Paton. She again fought off a serious challenge in 2014, holding on in a Republican wave year and beating former Arizona House Speaker Andy Tobin in one of the most expensive U.S. House races in the country.\n\nShe has also proven herself a strong fundraiser, raising $3.4 million for her re-election last year. As of the end of March, Kirkpatrick\u2019s campaign had about $300,000 on hand.\n\nBut Kirkpatrick faces an uphill battle against McCain. The five-term incumbent has never had a serious Democratic challenger in a U.S. Senate race.\n\nKirkpatrick acknowledged that she had a tough fight ahead of her.\n\n\u201cI respect John McCain\u2019s service to our nation. I just believe our state\u2019s changing. Arizonans should have a real choice who they send to the United States Senate,\u201d Kirkpatrick said in the video. \u201cI\u2019m not na\u00efve. I know that Washington insiders are already trying to dig up dirt. But having grown up here, a little mud on my boots is part of life.\u201d\n\nOther Democrats conceded that Kirkpatrick has an uphill climb against McCain, a 30-year incumbent and former Republican presidential nominee. But many saw cause for optimism as well.\n\n\n\nIn 2012, Kirkpatrick defied predictions and won in a district that GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney carried. Last year, she survived the onslaught of a nationwide Republican wave, winning by about five percentage points in an election where Republicans won every statewide seat in Arizona.\n\nAndy Barr, a Democratic campaign consultant, said Kirkpatrick already has to run what is practically a statewide race every year because of the sheer size of CD1. She campaigns heavily across a wide swatch of territory and runs multimillion-dollar advertising campaigns in the Phoenix and Tucson media markets.\n\n\u201cEvery time she runs, people sort of discount her. They think she\u2019s going to lose. And she always outperforms expectations,\u201d Barr said. \u201cI don\u2019t think they\u2019re in any denial that it\u2019s a tough climb. But for anyone, just the races she\u2019s run, the team she has, the infrastructure they already have put in place, that\u2019s pretty strong.\u201d\n\nDavid Waid, a Democratic campaign consultant, said Kirkpatrick should also benefit from running during a presidential election, which raises voter turnout and attracts many lower-efficacy voters who lean Democratic.\n\n\u201cShe couldn\u2019t have picked a better year to do this,\u201d Waid said.\n\nKirkpatrick\u2019s challenge also comes at a time when some believe McCain is more vulnerable than usual. In an early May poll, Public Policy Polling, a Democratic firm based in North Carolina, 50 percent of respondents had an unfavorable opinion of McCain\u2019s job performance, compared to 41 percent who approved.\n\nHowever, that poll also showed McCain winning a hypothetical matchup with Kirkpatrick, though not by a wide margin. McCain took 42 percent of the vote to Kirkpatrick\u2019s 36 percent, with 23 percent undecided. The poll had a 4-percent margin of error.\n\nRepublicans were still confident that McCain would defeat Kirkpatrick. He has extraordinarily high name identification, has raised more than $3.6 million for his re-election and is expected to raise plenty more. He\u2019s also known as a fierce campaigner who never takes a challenge for granted.\n\n\u201cShe has very much of an uphill fight to prove herself as a credible candidate to run against McCain,\u201d said Nathan Sproul, a Republican campaign consultant.\n\nBrian Murray, another GOP consultant, emphasized that Kirkpatrick is still a Democrat in a Republican state. As last year\u2019s election showed, when the GOP swept Arizona\u2019s statewide offices, Democrats still have many \u201cfundamental flaws\u201d that make it extremely difficult for them to win statewide, he said.\n\nMurray predicted that McCain would defeat Kirkpatrick by double digits.\n\n\u201cShe might be the only real opponent he\u2019s had in a really long time. But I still think she has zero chance,\u201d Murray said.\n\nMcCain had little response to the announcement. In an email, spokesman Brian Rogers said, \u201cSenator McCain welcomes Congresswoman Kirkpatrick to the race, and looks forward to running a vigorous campaign no matter who the Democratic nominee is.\u201d\n\nThe National Republican Senatorial Committee was far more vocal, providing a glimpse into the attacks Kirkpatrick will face with a list of what they called her \u201cgreatest hits.\u201d Among the GOP\u2019s knocks against Kirkpatrick were her 2010 vote for the Affordable Care Act, her support for President Obama and U.S. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, and the hiring of campaign staff to taxpayer-funded jobs after losing her first re-election in 2010.\n\n\n\nIn previous campaigns, Republicans have also repeatedly run ads featuring footage of her walking out of a meet-and-greet with angry constituents at a grocery store during her first term in office.\n\nWhile the buzz surrounding Kirkpatrick\u2019s candidacy focused on her chances against McCain, it\u2019s possible that she\u2019ll face a different Republican nominee. State Sen. Kelli Ward, R-Lake Havasu City, is exploring a GOP primary challenge against him, hoping to potentially exploit longtime animosity toward the senior senator by grassroots conservatives. Many conservatives still hope that Congressman Matt Salmon will run against McCain as well, which would present him with a far more serious challenge.\n\nDepending on the outcome of a pending U.S. Supreme Court case, a U.S. Senate race may be Kirkpatrick\u2019s best move.\n\nThe Arizona Legislature sued the Arizona Independent Redistricting Commission, arguing that only state legislatures are authorized by the Constitution to draw congressional districts. If the GOP-controlled Legislature wins, one of its top priorities is expected to be drawing Kirkpatrick into a Republican district.\n\nBut several Democrats said they did not believe Kirkpatrick\u2019s decision was in any way related to the possibility that she\u2019ll be drawn into a Republican district.\n\n\u201cI think she wanted to do it. And if you want to do it, it makes sense to just jump in and do it,\u201d Barr said. \u201cIf she had decided that this was the office she wanted to run for, I don\u2019t know why it made sense for her to wait any longer.\u201d\n\nKirkpatrick appears to have been contemplating a U.S. Senate race for some time. Her new campaign website, www.kirkpatrickforsenate.com, was registered in November, nearly two weeks after the election.\n\n\n\nIt is unknown what impact Kirkpatrick\u2019s decision will have on another possible Democratic aspirant for the U.S. Senate. Many observers believe Kyrsten Sinema planned to run for the seat if the Legislature gets an opportunity to redraw Arizona\u2019s congressional districts, and some questioned whether Kirkpatrick\u2019s candidacy would deter her from those plans. A spokeswoman for Sinema did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nRepublican political consultant Stan Barnes said Kirkpatrick is the underdog but McCain cannot underestimate her.\n\n\u201cAnd he won\u2019t,\u201d Barnes said.\n\n\u201cCampaigning is hard and she is battle-hardened,\u201d Barnes said, adding that Kirkpatrick also has a solid reputation in Washington, D.C. as well as in Democratic circles. That will help since she\u2019ll need a unified Democratic front, Barnes said.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s an attractive candidate from the center-left side of the political spectrum,\u201d the consultant added.\n\nIn order to win, Kirkpatrick must run a campaign that reflects the harsh reality that she\u2019s the underdog, Barnes said, adding that she also needs to raise at least $10 million. \u201cShe\u2019s got to live on a bus from Page to Patagonia, from Ehrenberg to Alpine,\u201d he said.\n\n-Luige del Puerto contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Democratic Arizona Rep.
