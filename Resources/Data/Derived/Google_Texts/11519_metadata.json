But repeated budget cuts would limit the Army\u2019s ability to respond in a timely fashion.\n\n\u201cAs we see our budget shrink, we are fiscally and physically unable to be in more and more places, which increases the response time,\u201d McHugh said.\n\nOdierno said the Army had already cut its aviation units by 25 percent, which also limited its ability to respond to multiple crises around the world simultaneously.\n\n\u201cWe have a huge window of risk in modernization and readiness,\u201d Odierno said. \u201cWe continue to increase the requirements and commitments of our forces, and yet we cannot ensure that we\u2019re going to have the readiness to meet those commitments.\u201d\n\n(Reporting by Andrea Shalal; Editing by Jim Loney)", "article_metadata": {"description": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Army warned on Monday that mandatory budget cuts due to resume in fiscal 2016 would be devastating to a service that is already facing huge risks as it tries to keep forces ready for battle, replace aging equipment and respond to crises around the world.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Free Beacon", "description": "By Andrea Shalal    WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Army warned on Monday that mandatory budget cuts due to resume in fiscal 2016 would be devastating to a service that is already facing huge risks as", "title": "U.S. Army Says it Faces Huge Equipment, Training Risks with Budget Cuts", "url": "http://freebeacon.com/national-security/u-s-army-says-it-faces-huge-equipment-training-risks-with-budget-cuts/", "image": "http://freebeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/U.S.-Army-Chief-of-Staff-General-Ray-Odierno-150x150.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://freebeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/U.S.-Army-Chief-of-Staff-General-Ray-Odierno-150x150.jpg", "title": "U.S. Army Says it Faces Huge Equipment, Training Risks with Budget Cuts", "site": "@freebeacon", "card": "summary", "description": "By Andrea Shalal    WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Army warned on Monday that mandatory budget cuts"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1047859882", "fb": {"app_id": "FB_APP_ID"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9d42\"", "article_summary": "But repeated budget cuts would limit the Army\u2019s ability to respond in a timely fashion.\n\u201cWe have to have a national security debate \u2026 because there is too much going on,\u201d U.S. Army Chief of Staff General Ray Odierno told reporters at the annual Association of the U.S. Army (AUSA) conference.\nArmy Secretary John McHugh told reporters that the Army had already made tough choices to delay and cancel weapons programs so it could achieve sequestration budget cuts, but further reductions would be very difficult to implement.\nBY:By Andrea ShalalWASHINGTON (Reuters) \u2013 The U.S. Army warned on Monday that mandatory budget cuts due to resume in fiscal 2016 would be devastating to a service that is already facing huge risks as it tries to keep forces ready for battle, replace aging equipment and respond to crises around the world.\nOdierno said the Army had already cut its aviation units by 25 percent, which also limited its ability to respond to multiple crises around the world simultaneously."}
