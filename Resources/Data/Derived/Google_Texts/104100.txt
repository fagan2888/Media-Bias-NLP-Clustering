On this weekend’s Last Week Tonight, John Oliver tackled the Medicaid gap over in ‘Merica, along with another doozy: local elections.

According to Oliver, for Mississippi, Virginia and Kentucky, local elections could either close or open the Medicaid gap. But what is the Medicaid gap?

Healthcare is like a pair of gym shorts. Even if it covers nearly all of what it’s supposed to, you’re still left with some problematic gaps, and terrible things can happen

In 2012, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld “nearly all” of the lovingly nicknamed Obamacare, Oliver explained. The concept to expand Medicaid entails the uninsured could be categorized into two groups. People who make 138 per cent or more of the poverty line could buy insurance with subsidies up to a certain point. Medicaid would expand to cover those who make less than that. But when 20 states decided not to expand Medicaid, it left more than 3 million people too “wealthy” to qualify for Medicaid and too poor to qualify and buy into Obamacare with subsidies.
