Unlike #Benghazi, the IRS and most other GOP-hyped scandals, the VA scandal is real \u2014 and now that they\u2019ve got a big scalp, with the resignation of Secretary Eric Shinseki, they\u2019re sure to be hungry for more, because that\u2019s just the way that they roll.\n\nBut, as usual, the real scandal is a good deal more complicated than the GOP would have you believe.\n\nAs Rachel Maddow observed on her May 29 program, the military is the only part of government that Congress wants to give more money to than the department itself wants. But the same largess does not extend to veterans.\n\n\u201cWhen given the chance to vote for an expansion in the care that veterans are waiting too long for, Congress has not treated veterans the way that they\u2019ve treated the defense department,\u201d Maddow explained. \u201cVeterans are treated more like food stamps, or education, or any other kind of funding that Republicans won\u2019t pass in the House and that they will filibuster in the Senate, because they don\u2019t want to pay for it.\u201d\n\nWhen George W. Bush was president, Republicans were happy to create a massive need for future VA healthcare. Ergo,\u201dThe Three Trillion Dollar War\u201d (since updated to $5 trillion). Now, instead of paying the true cost of the war, they not only want to stiff the surviving veterans, they\u2019d like to use the mess they\u2019ve created as an excuse to privatize VA healthcare \u2014 and that\u2019s the ultimate, big-picture scandal here.\n\nLet\u2019s break it down a bit into its major parts.\n\n1. A major GOP objective is to privatize the VA \u2014 something that veterans themselves are opposed to.\n\nOn May 15, the Senate Committee on Veterans\u2019 Affairs held a hearing on the state of VA healthcare, where top leaders of the veterans service organizations testified. The ranking Republican, Sen. Richard Burr of North Carolina, skipped out on their testimony, and then, eight days later \u2014 the Friday before the Memorial Day weekend \u2014 posted an open letter blasting them all, except for the American Legion, for not calling for Gen. Shinseki to resign (as the AL had done).\n\nThis was, ostensibly, the only measure of their worth in Burr\u2019s mind. And they were not on board with his witch-hunting agenda. Indeed, Joseph A. Violante, the national legislative director of Disabled American Veterans, testified that, \u201cwe continue to have confidence that VA, led by Secretary Shinseki, can and will correct any problems identified or uncovered. This Secretary has a track record of directly and honestly confronting problems that he has inherited or that were uncovered during his tenure, and then working with Congress and stakeholders to correct them.\u201d He then went on to cite a series of major major systemic problems that Shinseki had tackled and resolved. This was definitely not what Republicans wanted to hear.\n\nBut there was actually much more to the story than Burr trying to strong-arm the veterans organizations. Even worse than their reluctance to turn on Shinseki was their reluctance to turn on the VA itself, as Violante also made abundantly clear:\n\nMoreover, let me emphasize one point on which we are resolute: the VA health care system is both indispensable and irreplaceable; there is no substitute for it. Based upon our collective knowledge and experience, we continue to believe that VA provides high-quality health care for the vast majority of veterans treated each year, and that veterans are now and will be better served in the future by a robust VA health care system than by any other model of care. The real challenge facing VA, and the root cause of the issues being reported today, have to do with access to care rather than the quality of care that is delivered.\n\nThe exact same sentiment was expressed by Carl Blake, national legislative director for Paralyzed Veterans of America. Blake\u2019s testimony initially focused on the VA\u2019s Spinal Cord Injury/Disorder (SCI/D) system. Following a good deal of detailed testimony \u2014 specifically illuminating the problems involved \u2014 Blake stepped back to observe:\n\nThe statistics reflect the fact that many veterans who might be seeking care in the VA are unable to attain that care. But to be clear, these facts reflect an access problem, not a quality of care problem. Access and quality is not the same thing. Veterans who have incurred a spinal cord injury or disorder and who get regular care at the VA are very satisfied with the care they are receiving. In fact, patient satisfaction surveys bear out this point. Unfortunately, for too long the VA has been provided insufficient resources to properly address the tremendous staffing shortages that exist, not only in the SCI/D system of care, but across the entire system.\n\nFurthermore, in responding to Sen. Burr\u2019s letter attacking the veterans organizations\u2019 leadership, PVA\u2019s president, Bill Lawson, and executive director, Homer Townsend Jr., pointedly stated:\n\nSenator, your continued efforts to simply \u201cfix\u201d the VA\u2019s problem by privatizing health care shows that you are more interested in diminishing the VA health care system and promoting your political interests.\n\n2. Congressional Republicans have blocked VA funding in the past \u2014 obviously exacerbating the problem.\n\nThere is a long, sordid history of politicians giving lip service to service members and veterans on the one hand, and treating them like dirt on the other. But congressional Republicans in recent years have turned this sordid practice into a high art, and Sen. Burr himself is one the ablest practitioners. As PVA\u2019s leaders pointed out in their response to Burr:\n\nGiven the opportunity to support legislation that would remove all of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) budget from the partisan bickering and political gridlock, of which you are an active participant, that has completely crippled the appropriations process, you opposed that legislation. Given the opportunity to support legislation that would ensure all generations of veterans, not just Post-9/11 era veterans, have access to the Comprehensive Caregiver Assistance program administered by the VA, you chose to oppose that legislation. Given the opportunity to support legislation that would provide reproductive assistance to veterans whose catastrophic disabilities rendered them unable to have children, you chose to oppose that legislation. Given the opportunity to ensure that the VA has fully sufficient resources to establish adequate capacity and properly meet the health care demands of veterans, you have chosen to send them out into the private health care marketplace that cares more about the bottom dollar than the health and well-being of those men and women.\n\nOf course, Burr is only one example of his whole sorry party in Congress. On \u201cAll In With Chris Hayes,\u201d Jon Soltz of Votevets.org amplified the big picture point:\n\nThis is about public health care. And when you look at the attacks from the right, this has been a long time coming, in regards to attacks from the far right. People are attacking the VA because it\u2019s public healthcare. And they see it as something that is challenging to them. Or scares them. And so, really what this is about is privatizing the VA. The VA has been underfunded for years by conservatives on Capitol Hill, and that\u2019s what they look at. And what we have here, not just in the VA, but in the country, is more of a health care crisis, where people are coming to the VA because that is the help that they need, and it\u2019s not prepared, because it\u2019s not funded properly by Congress and it hasn\u2019t been for decades.\n\nSoltz had criticism for Shinseki as well \u2014 but not the kind you normally hear:\n\nGeneral Shinseki is not a bad administrator, what he is is a bad public affairs officer, and the first thing I would have done if I was him is say, \u2018Hey, Mitch McConnell, you\u2019re the Senate Minority Leader, and you\u2019re blocking a $21 billion package we need so I can do my job.\u2019 That\u2019s all they have to say.\n\n3. The GOP is responsible for creating so many war veterans in the first place \u2014 and for going to war in a way that produced even more casualties than necessary from their misguided plans.", "article_metadata": {"description": "How rich: GOP starts the wars, mismanages them, creates need for care, then underfunds it.
