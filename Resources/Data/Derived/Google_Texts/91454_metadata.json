The friendship has helped shield Brennan from critics \u2014 including Democratic senators \u2014 who have called for his resignation after the CIA admitted to spying on congressional staffers.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAmong members of the intelligence community, Brennan has \u201cthe closest relationship with the president,\u201d said former Rep. Jane Harman (D-Calif.), who spent eight years on the House Intelligence Committee and is now the director of the Wilson Center.\n\nBrennan quickly became a trusted adviser to Obama amid the heated 2008 Democratic presidential primary. Like most politicians, Obama has repeatedly shown a strong allegiance to longtime supporters.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a major bonding experience,\u201d said Mark Lowenthal, a former assistant director at the CIA. \u201cIf somebody signed on [early in the race], that matters a lot. Loyalty matters a lot.\u201d\n\nThe Obama-Brennan relationship is now facing a huge test.\n\nSens.

Wyden said on MSNBC last week that an independent counsel might be needed to investigate the CIA spying.\n\nThe agency has pushed back against the upcoming release of the interrogation report, which is expected to show that the George W. Bush administration practices were incredibly harsh, pervasive and did not contribute to fighting terrorists.\n\nBrennan firmly denied the charges, when Senate Intelligence Committee Chairwoman Dianne Feinstein Dianne FeinsteinClinton\u2019s email troubles deepen Top Dem: CIA officials thought spying on Senate \u2018was flat out wrong\u2019 Senate panel advances spy policy bill, after House approves its own version MORE (D-Calif.) raised them earlier this year. He then had to do a humbling about-face after his agency\u2019s inspector general looked into the matter.\n\nThe scuffle has only lowered Brennan\u2019s esteem on Capitol Hill, where it was never particularly high to begin with.\n\nA former senior administration official predicted Brennan wouldn\u2019t be fired because Obama\u2019s respect and trust for him would win out: \u201cBrennan really put himself out there with this. He put himself on a limb, and his team cut it off behind him.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t help this White House,\u201d another former administration official stated. \u201cAnd they must not be thrilled with him making that assessment and it being wrong. He did not help his cause with the Hill.\u201d\n\nObama has stood by Brennan and last week maintained that he has \u201cfull confidence\u201d in the CIA chief.\n\nEven with the recent scandal, \u201cI think the president trusts him 100 percent and that\u2019s the key here,\u201d the first official said. \u201cHe thinks he\u2019s indispensable, and he\u2019s probably right. There are few people who know more than Brennan about the intelligence landscape.\u201d\n\nBrennan was considered Obama\u2019s first choice to lead the CIA in late 2008. But soon after winning the presidency, the left revolted over comments from Brennan that seemed to show his support for \u201cenhanced interrogation\u201d practices, such as waterboarding.\n\nThe 25-year CIA veteran was subsequently named the president\u2019s counterterrorism adviser, a position that did not need Senate confirmation and had him working out of a windowless office in the White House basement.\n\nWhile it might not have come with the prestige of leading the country\u2019s most recognizable spy agency, being able to work feet from the Oval Office helped cement his relationship with Obama, Lowenthal said.\n\n\u201cPeople used to say he had more access to the president than the [director of national intelligence] or the head of the CIA did,\u201d he said. \u201cThey worked very closely together for all those years before the president sent John to Langley.\u201d\n\nIn addition to Obama, multiple former officials told The Hill that Brennan has another close ally in Denis McDonough Denis McDonoughRyan secures big win with bipartisan Puerto Rico deal Trump, GOP agree: ObamaCare helps us Clinton\u2019s top five vice presidential picks MORE, who is now Obama\u2019s chief of staff.\n\nThe second senior administration official said it was always clear how much McDonough \u201creally, really loved Brennan.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re cut from the same cloth, in terms of no drama and no theatrics,\u201d the source added. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of mutual respect in the abilities of the other \u2026 which is why last week was so shocking.\u201d\n\nObama reportedly used to refer to the trio of Brennan, McDonough and Tom Donilon \u2014 who served as national security adviser when McDonough was his deputy \u2014 as the \u201cgrim Irishmen.\u201d\n\nBrennan has often come across as a brusque, dour, no-nonsense figure, yet he has gained a number of acolytes in the intelligence community and the White House.\n\nIn a 2012 interview with The Washington Post, Brennan said he was rejected by the Bush administration \u2014 which he left in 2005 to work for a private contractor before joining Obama\u2019s campaign \u2014 \u201cbecause I was not seen as someone who was a team player.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m probably not a team player here, either,\u201d he added, referring to the Obama administration. \u201cI tend to do what I think is right. But I find much more comfort, I guess, in the views and values of this president.\u201d\n\nBrennan finally got his shot at the CIA last year, after a sex scandal led to former director, Gen. David Petraeus\u2019s resignation.\n\nWhile announcing the nomination in January 2013, Obama called Brennan \u201cone of my closest advisers\u201d and \u201ca great friend.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "The CIA chief has all the cover he needs in President Obama.", "description": "The CIA chief has all the cover he needs in President Obama.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Julian Hattem and Amie Parnes", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "The CIA chief has all the cover he needs in President Obama.", "title": "Under fire, CIA chief has key ally", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/technology/214433-under-fire-cia-chief-has-key-ally", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/article_images/obamabarack_brennanjohn_010713getty.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-02T05:39:37-05:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/technology/214433-under-fire-cia-chief-has-key-ally", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "The CIA chief has all the cover he needs in President Obama.", "card": "summary", "title": "Under fire, CIA chief has key ally"}, "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-02T05:39-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/technology/214433-under-fire-cia-chief-has-key-ally", "dcterms.date": "2014-08-06T06:00-04:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Megan Ruyle", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": ",Dianne Feinstein, Denis McDonough, Martin Heinrich, Mark Udall, Ron Wyden,", "article": {"published_time": "2014-08-06T06:00:04-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-02T05:39:37-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "dcterms.title": "Under fire, CIA chief has key ally"}, "article_summary": "Wyden said on MSNBC last week that an independent counsel might be needed to investigate the CIA spying.\n645X363 - No Companion - Full Sharing - Additional videos are suggested - Policy/Regulation/BlogsJohn Brennan is under fire, but the CIA chief has all the cover he needs in President Obama.\nHe put himself on a limb, and his team cut it off behind him.\u201d\u201cIt doesn\u2019t help this White House,\u201d another former administration official stated.\nHe did not help his cause with the Hill.\u201dObama has stood by Brennan and last week maintained that he has \u201cfull confidence\u201d in the CIA chief.\nA former senior administration official predicted Brennan wouldn\u2019t be fired because Obama\u2019s respect and trust for him would win out: \u201cBrennan really put himself out there with this."}
