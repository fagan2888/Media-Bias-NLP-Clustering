Bill Haslam was given a C grade by the NRA. I\u2019m sure after this week he\u2019s been given an A plus.\n\nEmployers did not want their employees to bring guns to the workplace, but Bill said it was OK to have guns in their trunks. Citizens did not want guns in their parks, but Bill said that wasn\u2019t a problem.\n\nNow he has let a bill pass that will allow employees on Tennessee college campuses to carry guns. The governor of Georgia vetoed this bill the same day that our governor let it pass into law without signing it. How spineless.\n\nAs governor, he is to provide leadership and work for the health, safety and welfare of the citizens of this state.\n\nBill didn\u2019t want to go along with Obamacare so he took his time and came up with his own plan. He presented it to the legislators and then walked away. He has never tried to work with them to endorse the plan.\n\nPoor, sick people are not those that he or our legislators care about.\n\nBill had to get into the business of discrimination by signing the recent therapist bill that tells therapists it is OK to discriminate. The American Counseling Association was against this bill and was to hold its annual conference in Nashville in 2017. Let\u2019s hope they cancel this event. I feel badly for businesses if they do this but it needs to be done as money is the only thing that matters to a billionaire like Bill Haslam.\n\nDebra Obroc, Hendersonville 37075\n\nSome MNPS director candidates lack qualifications\n\nOf the six candidates originally presented to the school board for the director of Metro schools, three of the candidates do not have a doctorate and one does not even have a master\u2019s degree.\n\nThe salary for this position is in the vicinity of a quarter of a million dollars per year. The mayor of Nashville makes $180,000 a year.\n\nFor such a lofty payout, do we not deserve a more qualified choice? The man charged with conducting the search and presenting the final list of candidates was brought to tears when asked how he felt about his choices. My guess is that his tears were those of joy because he is getting compensated at least $50,000 for his work.\n\nFor this process to have taken as long as it has, most would wonder why half of the choices for such an important position do not have the required educational background necessary to make this hire a competent one.\n\nRandie Arnold, Nashville 37221\n\nParenting key to raising nonviolent youth\n\nWhen I began to practice adolescent medicine I saw myself as teenagers passed from delinquents to law-abiding adults.\n\nIt didn\u2019t take long to learn that most teens are well rooted in their value system and while changing behavior and attitudes at that age are possible, it is difficult at best.\n\nThe time to start parenting teenagers starts when they are born if not before.\n\nKids of all ages need two parents, so I suggest that every pregnant, single woman find a man of character \u2014 her brother, father, uncle, other relative, or neighbor \u2014 who can be present for the life of her child. Together they become guides that lead the child to being a person of character.\n\nWhen parents of character love and respect each other, their families, and their community, the children will show that same love and respect and become character-filled, non-violent youth and adults.\n\nThe secret is to be the person you want your child to become. And that doesn\u2019t even cost any money.\n\nParnell Donahue, Brentwood 37027\n\nMending fences; building walls (Photo: Cagle Cartoons)\n\nRead or Share this story: http://tnne.ws/275vt6w", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Readers sound off on Gov.
