Jackson, Religion, Religious Right, Republican Party, Virginia, Elections News, Politics News\n\nE.W. Jackson, the minister, lawyer and Republican candidate for lieutenant governor in the state of Virginia, is not a man known to hold his tongue. Slavery wasn\u2019t as bad to black families as the Great Society programs of the 1960s? He said it. Planned Parenthood and the Democratic Party pose a greater danger to African-American lives than the KKK ever did? That was him, too. Or how about yoga, and the fact that it\u2019s a gateway to \u2026 Satan? Yup, you guessed it \u2014 E.W.J., all the way.\n\nIt\u2019s therefore difficult to be truly surprised by the man who would be lieutenant governor\u2019s latest outburst. (Though, by all means, please do be offended.) Speaking this Sunday at a morning sermon in Northern Virginia, Jackson offered up a small example of some of his more \u201ccontroversial\u201d beliefs \u2014 beliefs that, it should be noted, Jackson considers mandatory for practicing Christians. From the Washington Post:\n\n\u201cAny time you say, \u2018There is no other means of salvation but through Jesus Christ, and if you don\u2019t know him and you don\u2019t follow him and you don\u2019t go through him, you are engaged in some sort of false religion,\u2019 that\u2019s controversial. But it\u2019s the truth,\u201d Jackson said, according to a recording of the sermon by a Democratic tracker.", "article_metadata": {"description": "E.W.
