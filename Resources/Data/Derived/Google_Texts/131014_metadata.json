Baron went to UCLA for a fellowship in pediatric gastroenterology intending to return to join a private practice in Minneapolis in 1993. He took a detour to Las Vegas and joined the practice of Sharon Schaffer instead.\n\nHe hasn\u2019t looked back.\n\n\u201cThe opportunity was fantastic here from that standpoint,\u201d Baron says. \u201cThere was only one pediatric gastroenterologist in the state of Nevada at that time, and she was looking for a partner. It seemed like a solid opportunity with a ton of growth going on here at that time, and it seemed like an opportunity to build a practice quickly and be part of the community. In more well-established medical communities, it\u2019s sometimes harder to break in and harder to make as much of an impact.\u201d\n\nSchaffer has since retired, but Baron and two other doctors comprise the Pediatric Gastroenterology &Nutrition Associates. The doctors are specialists for children\u2019s digestive diseases such as Crohn\u2019s, colitis, pancreatic and liver conditions, including congenital diseases and birth defects. They provide pre- and postcare for children who need liver transplants. They address nutritional diseases, celiac disease, gluten sensitivity, food allergies, acid reflux and other digestive system disorders, including those caused by stress, anxiety or emotional issues.\n\nBaron is a native of Canada whose family moved to Minneapolis when he was 6. His father sold furniture; his mother was a secretary. His brother, an attorney, jokes with him that their parents bought T-shirts when they were toddlers that said, \u201cMy son is a lawyer\u201d and \u201cMy son is a doctor.\u201d\n\nBaron\u2019s interest in medicine was sparked by a survey in junior high school in which he scored high for a career in science. The thought of being a doctor appealed to him, and he started to prepare himself for that career when he was in high school. His parents encouraged him.\n\n\u201cEven though my family weren\u2019t medical people, health was a very high priority value for them,\u201d Baron said. \u201cI grew up in a family that respects physicians and health care workers. I have an aunt who\u2019s a registered nurse in Canada, and she was always held in high esteem in the family.\u201d\n\nDeciding to become a doctor, however, is easier than choosing a medical specialty.\n\nBaron says he went from idea to idea during training. When he started medical school at the University of Minnesota, he was interested in child psychiatry. He did some extra research in it and extra rotations and was going into a residency program that led him to that career. At the last minute, he decided to switch gears and got a general pediatric residency because he wanted to make sure he had a really good medical background in children\u2019s diseases.\n\nBaron credited the pediatric doctors who supervised him for treating him better than those from other specialties.\n\n\u201cI found it a much more relaxed and enjoyable atmosphere,\u201d Baron says. \u201cI enjoyed the interaction with parents as an advocate for their kids more so than when you\u2019re dealing with adults who aren\u2019t the best advocates for themselves and don\u2019t do what\u2019s in their best medical interest. The attending physicians were much more collegial and in good spirits than other areas of rotation. There wasn\u2019t this sense of one-upmanship and competitiveness that I found in other specialties like surgery and internal medicine.\u201d\n\nBaron said one of his first experiences as an intern at the University of Minnesota was in the pediatric intensive care unit. He liked it and applied for it and did research projects. He was selected for a fellowship at San Diego Children\u2019s Hospital to do critical care but delayed going when he was selected as a chief resident in the pediatric program at Minnesota.\n\n\u201cDuring that time of deferral, the people that were mentoring me in critical care were burning out, getting a divorce or moving away,\u201d Baron says. \u201cEach and every one seemed to be having some sort of an issue, and I decided critical care didn\u2019t have a long life span for me.\u201d\n\nThe pediatric residency led to a doctor encouraging him to enter pediatric gastroenterology.\n\n\u201cGastroenterology was a good mix of procedural things but also the hands on of clinic work that I enjoyed with critical care and as well dealing with some of the emotional issues of psychiatry that had to be dealt with as well,\u201d Baron said. \u201cAnd the guy mentoring me back in Minnesota, I enjoyed his style and sense of patience. Frequently, it\u2019s like that when someone you met spurs you on like that with an interest in a certain area. That\u2019s what happened with me.\u201d\n\nPediatric gastroenterologists handle endoscopic procedures, place feeding tubes, biopsy livers, insert catheters and perform other procedures. Some of the procedures may be similar for adults, but there\u2019s smaller equipment and more finesse needed to deal with parents and children, Baron said.\n\nPediatric training is necessary because children have developing digestive systems that differ from those in adults, Baron says. The scope of work is different with those working with adults focusing on cancer screenings, dealing with heartburn and diverticulitis.\n\nWhat pediatric gastroenterologists see in Las Vegas is similar to what\u2019s seen in other major metropolitan areas. But Baron says Southern Nevada has a higher Medicaid population than other regions of the country. It consists of 40 percent of his practice, and children on Medicaid tend to have higher incidents of congenital birth defects, development delay problems, feeding problems and other disorders, he says.\n\n\u201cThe population naturally lends itself to subspecialized care,\u201d Baron says. \u201cI think if you look at people below the poverty line, they are more likely to have teenage pregnancies and more likely not to have strong prenatal care. They have fewer resources to take care of kids with complex problems and tend to populate emergency rooms more for primary care than sticking with primary care follow-up.\u201d\n\nBaron and his wife, Bonni, have two daughters. Alayna is a first-grade teacher in Las Vegas and Zoe is a freshman at the University of Nevada, Reno. He said he made the right call to come to Las Vegas and even though the weather didn\u2019t factor into his decision, it turned out well in hindsight compared with the brutal winter in Minnesota. Although he opted against working as a child psychiatrist, he said his decision to work with children has been rewarding.\n\n\u201cI find it rewarding when a parent thanks you or a child gives you a hug because they recognize you\u2019re doing something that\u2019s beneficial to them,\u201d Baron says. \u201cI can deal easily with a 4-year-old that behaves like a 4-year-old. What I have a hard time dealing with is a 40-year-old that behaves like a 4-year-old.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Howard Baron epitomizes many doctors in the medical profession in Southern Nevada \u2014 highly trained out-of-state residents lured here by the opportunity they saw in a high-growth region.
