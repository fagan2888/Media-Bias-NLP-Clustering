Keep it simple, stupid.\n\nThis has been an underlying theme at this week\u2019s Redefining Early Stage Investments conference in Houston.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut this simplicity rarely happens. Life sciences companies in particular are guilty of getting deep in the weeds when explaining their technology to the angels \u2013 and wind up alienating potential investors as a result.\n\n\u201cScientists have a knack for making simplicity complex,\u201d Koffler said. \u201cBut you have to simplify things one step at a time so investors can get it.\u201d\n\nEntrepreneurs often say that, if they just had enough time, they\u2019d be able to convey what a great opportunity their technology presents, said Casey Cunningham at Sant\u00e9 Ventures. But you need to keep it tight. Educate the investor on what the opportunity is in the framework of an elevator pitch.\n\nPresenting a realistic market to investors and making sure your data\u2019s sufficiently validated before approaching an investor \u2013 well that\u2019s key, too.\n\n\u201cWhile you may not get to an inflection point in an elevator pitch, we want to hear the exit,\u201d Cunningham said. \u201cYou really do have to boil it down to what the value proposition is, and lead with that.\u201d\n\nBecause when life sciences startups present their terms in a convoluted fashion \u2013 as they often do \u2013 they get dropped quickly. The competition is just that fierce.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of deal flow,\u201d said Robert Tucci, co-chair of sciences and life sciences at the Houston Angel Network. \u201cThe challenge for us is to triage it very quickly so we can get to the things that really fit our target.\u201d\n\nA lot of early stage efforts look like grant applications or scientific papers, said John Westwick, the entrepreneur-in-residence at Mercury Fund. Investors can generally trust clearly presented science. So it\u2019s more important to map out a clear path to an inflection point.\n\n\u201cYou make it hard on the angels by making it unnecessarily complicated,\u201d said Philip Sanger, managing partner of Texo Ventures.\n\nSo that\u2019s that. The life sciences are hard. Simplicity matters.\n\nPhoto: Stock.xchng user cozgrl05", "article_metadata": {"description": "Life sciences startups are guilty of having unduly complicated investment pitches.
