Now, he\u2019s sharing his experience, because he hopes it will lead other young men to screen themselves, or get screened for testicular cancer.\n\nTanner Hill is a 2005 Tuttle High School graduate and an OU student. He says he began experiencing pain in his right testicle two summers ago, but because of concerns about his job he put off getting it checked out. By the time he went to a specialist, his right testicle had grown to the size of a baseball.\n\nDoctors removed Tanner\u2019s right testicle a year ago, and last month he underwent brain surgery because the cancer had spread.\n\nFriday, he finished the last of ten chemotherapy and high-dose radiation treatments at Integris Cancer Institute.\n\n\u201cOnce you\u2019ve accepted death, and it doesn\u2019t happen, you kind of let things go, and it puts things in perspective. You realize life is fleeting,\u201d said Tanner.\n\nHe\u2019s not giving up his fight. His doctors say advances in medicine give him a much better chance at a longer life.", "article_metadata": {"wn-build": "XSLT-7.1-17", "Description": "A 29-year-old testicular cancer patient is in the fight of his life.", "author": "Steve Shaw", "og": {"url": "http://www.news9.com/story/30338907/oklahoma-testicular-cancer-patient-does-good-deeds-for-strangers", "image": "http://KWTV.images.worldnow.com/images/9087889_G.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "A 29-year-old testicular cancer patient is in the fight of his life.", "title": "Oklahoma Testicular Cancer Patient Does Good Deeds For Strangers"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://KWTV.images.worldnow.com/images/9087889_G.jpg", "description": "A 29-year-old testicular cancer patient is in the fight of his life.", "card": "summary", "title": "Oklahoma Testicular Cancer Patient Does Good Deeds For Strangers"}, "wnreadableurl": "oklahoma-testicular-cancer-patient-does-good-deeds-for-strangers", "ROBOTS": "index,follow,noarchive", "owner": "KWTV", "fb": {"app_id": 538140636230283}, "date": "2015/10/23", "KEYWORDS": "Cancer, fight, testicular cancer, patient, Integris, Tanner Hill, medicine, health, okc, news 9, kwtv", "wn-version": "ContainerE-Story", "wn-base": "IIS26", "verify-v1": "d5ZN+GNiazjgWlnr3WHikwraMvFljdUSLMgex4CGnc8=", "news_keywords": "Cancer, fight, testicular cancer, patient, Integris, Tanner Hill, medicine, health, okc, news 9, kwtv"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc59d\"", "article_summary": "A 29-year-old testicular cancer patient is in the fight of his lifeA 29-year-old testicular cancer patient is in the fight of his life.\nNow, he\u2019s sharing his experience, because he hopes it will lead other young men to screen themselves, or get screened for testicular cancer.\nBy the time he went to a specialist, his right testicle had grown to the size of a baseball.\nDoctors removed Tanner\u2019s right testicle a year ago, and last month he underwent brain surgery because the cancer had spread.\nHe says he began experiencing pain in his right testicle two summers ago, but because of concerns about his job he put off getting it checked out."}
