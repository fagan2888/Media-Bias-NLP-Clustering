Together, their responses illustrate the diversity of the indigenous communities of the Western Hemisphere, as well as their shared concerns, and offer insights beyond what\u2019s in the news to the ideas and experiences of Native peoples today.\n\nPlease introduce yourself with your name and title.\n\nRobert James Super, Karuk tribal vice-chairman.\n\nCan you share your Native name with us?\n\nSuper comes from Supahan, which means \"bringer of the morning star.\" My ancestor was a medicine man for our tribe, so he prayed to bring good days for our people. The non-Natives shortened it to Super.\n\nWhere is the Karuk Tribe located?\n\nOur main office is in Happy Camp, California.\n\nWhere are the Karuk people originally from?\n\nOur aboriginal land is in Siskiyou and Humboldt counties, California, and a little piece of Oregon. We have stayed in our aboriginal territory.\n\nWhat is a significant point in history from your tribe that you would like to share?\n\nWe signed a treaty in the mid-1800s. It was not ratified, but the U.S. government and the State of California still took our land.\n\nHow is your tribal government set up?\n\nOur Tribal Council is comprised of nine members elected by our tribal membership. We have a chairman, vice-chairman, secretary/treasurer, and six members-at-large who represent our three districts.\n\nIs there functional, traditional entity of leadership in addition to your modern government system?\n\nWe have boards and committees that interested tribal members are selected to sit on. Those bodies represent the membership and tribe throughout the organization.\n\nHow often are elected leaders chosen?\n\nWe have staggered four-year terms for each position on the Tribal Council.\n\nHow often does your council meet?\n\nOur Tribal Council meets twice a month in meetings that are open to tribal members and twice a month for closed planning sessions.\n\nHow did your life experience prepare you to lead your tribe?\n\nI learned our culture when I was a teen. I also served on boards and committees throughout my life to help our people. I am 53 years old now, so I am more prepared to represent several different topics related to our people.\n\nWhat responsibility do you have as a tribal leader?\n\nTo make the best decisions for our membership.\n\nWho inspired you as a mentor?\n\nMy cousin and his wife, Fred and Elizabeth Case. She was our medicine woman for our ceremonies.\n\nAre you a descendant of a historical leader?\n\nWe originally had different villages on the Klamath River. We all met up when things needed to be prayed for and to observe ceremonies. Each family had head family members, so we are all descended from those leaders.\n\nApproximately how many people are in your tribe?\n\nThere are 3,723 enrolled members in the Karuk Tribe.\n\nWhat are the criteria to become a member of your tribe?\n\nA person must be one-eighth degree of Karuk blood to be considered for enrollment.\n\nIs your language still spoken on your homelands? If so, what percentage of your people would you estimate are fluent speakers?\n\nWe have approximately 10 recorded fluent speakers of our language. We also have a language program to preserve and teach Karuk.\n\nTo read the full interview, visit the NMAI series here.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The National Museum of the American Indian interview series Meet Native America continues today with Robert James Super.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2015/04/18/robert-james-super-nmais-meet-native-america-series-160056", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "image": "http://d1jrw5jterzxwu.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/article_media/members_of_the_karuk_tribal_council_2014-2015_-_courtesy_karuk_tribe.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "Robert James Super: NMAI\u2019s Meet Native America Series"}, "abstract": "The National Museum of the American Indian interview series Meet Native America continues today with Robert James Super.", "dc": {"title": "Robert James Super: NMAI\u2019s Meet Native America Series"}, "robots": "follow, index", "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2015/04/18/robert-james-super-nmais-meet-native-america-series-160056", "dcterms.creator": "kpolisse", "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Dennis Zotigh, NMAI, National Museum of the American Indian, Meet Native America, Robert James Super, Karuk Tribe", "validation_code": "d9d37d7b776cc351c4025ded3df21cad", "sioc": {"num_replies": 0}, "dcterms.date": "2015-04-18T13:00-04:00", "dcterms.title": "Robert James Super: NMAI\u2019s Meet Native America Series"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdec1c\"", "article_summary": "Robert James Super, Karuk tribal vice-chairman.\nOur Tribal Council meets twice a month in meetings that are open to tribal members and twice a month for closed planning sessions.\nWe have boards and committees that interested tribal members are selected to sit on.\nWhere is the Karuk Tribe located?\nWe have staggered four-year terms for each position on the Tribal Council."}
