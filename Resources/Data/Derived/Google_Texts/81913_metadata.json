Circuit ruled that the Obama administration has been implementing Obamacare illegally. Days later, a video featuring the law\u2019s chief architect confirmed the court\u2019s ruling and raised questions about whether administration officials knew they were breaking the law all along.\n\nJonathan Gruber is the MIT economist who helped congressional Democrats write the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act in 2009. He has been sharply critical of Halbig v. Burwell , a lawsuit alleging the Obama administration is illegally subsidizing health insurance for 5 million Americans in the 36 states with exchanges established by the federal government. The PPACA offers those subsidies to only those who enroll through an exchange \u201cestablished by the State.\u201d (Disclosure: I helped lay the groundwork for Halbig and three similar lawsuits.)\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThe administration\u2019s supporters have called those lawsuits an \u201c existential threat\u201d to the PPACA. They\u2019re right. Without those subsidies, exchange enrollees in two-thirds of the country would face the full cost of Obamacare coverage. The resulting backlash would force Congress to reopen the law.\n\nThe administration\u2019s defenders responded to the Halbig case by insisting that Congress never intended to withhold subsidies from residents of states that did not establish exchanges. Like the Obama administration, Gruber told the D.C. Circuit that this idea is \u201cimplausible.\u201d The D.C. Circuit disagreed when it ruled for the plaintiffs last Tuesday.\n\nGruber then became part of the story on Thursday when a video surfaced in which he espouses the very interpretation of the law he now publicly derides as \u201cscrewy,\u201d \u201cnutty\u201d and \u201cstupid.\u201d In 2012, Gruber told an audience: \u201cIf you\u2019re a state and you don\u2019t set up an exchange, that means your citizens don\u2019t get their tax credits.\u201d\n\nThe administration\u2019s \u201cimplausibility\u201d argument was itself always implausible. Even the 4th Circuit rejected it when it ruled in favor of the government (in King v. Burwell ) on the same day the D.C. Circuit ruled for the plaintiffs. The Gruber video demolishes that argument.\n\nGruber\u2019s stature and role in writing the PPACA are critical here. One of the nation\u2019s top health economists, he helped craft and implement a nearly identical law in Massachusetts. He was a paid adviser to the Obama administration in 2009 and 2010. The New York Times reports, \u201cthe White House lent him to Capitol Hill to help Congressional staff members draft the specifics of the legislation.\u201d\n\nGruber was so heavily involved in writing the PPACA that when he boasts, \u201c I know more about this law than any other economist\u201d \u2014 and that he even wrote part of the bill himself \u2014 everyone believes him. When the chief architect of the PPACA admits it withholds tax credits in uncooperative states, that establishes that the plaintiffs\u2019 interpretation of the statute in Halbig was not only plausible but that it had currency among the law\u2019s authors.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO Magazine", "description": "Opinion: Jonathan Gruber's attempts to explain his slips belie his intellect and familiarity.", "title": "The Flip-Flopping Architect of the ACA", "url": "http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2014/07/jonathan-gruber-the-flip-flopping-architect-of-the-aca-109466.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2014/07/28/140728_cannon_gruber_ap.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Obamacare,Opinion,In The Arena", "twitter": {"site": "@politicomag", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politicomag"}, "description": "Opinion: Jonathan Gruber's attempts to explain his slips belie his intellect and familiarity.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "In The Arena The Flip-Flopping Architect of the ACALast week, the D.C.\nHe was a paid adviser to the Obama administration in 2009 and 2010.\nCircuit ruled that the Obama administration has been implementing Obamacare illegally.\nLike the Obama administration, Gruber told the D.C.\nCircuit ruled for the plaintiffs."}
