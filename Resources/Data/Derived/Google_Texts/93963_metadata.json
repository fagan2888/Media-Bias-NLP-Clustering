Lamar Alexander tours a Smith & Nephew medical device plant in Memphis with Gene Baker, Smith & Nephew vice president of Memphis operations, as his guide.\n\n\n\nBy Kevin McKenzie of The Commercial Appeal\n\nU.S. Sen. Lamar Alexander toured a Smith & Nephew plant in Memphis Monday and called for a speedier federal process for approving promising medical devices, similar to a 2012 law passed for breakthrough drugs.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019d like to have a breakthrough for devices,\u201d the Tennessee Republican said following a tour of a manufacturing facility for the London-based medical device maker.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act in 2012 included a \u201cbreakthrough therapy designation\u201d that expedites the development and review of promising drugs that treat serious or life-threatening conditions.\n\nSimilar legislation for medical devices, the Advancing Breakthrough Devices for Patients Act of 2015 was introduced in April by Sen. Michael Bennett (D-Colorado), Sen. Richard Burr (R-North Carolina) and Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah).\n\nAlexander, chairman of the Senate\u2019s Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, has set as a top priority reforming the FDA to get more treatments and medical devices to market more quickly and cheaply.\n\nA breakthrough designation for medical devices would also help manufacturers such as Smith & Nephew with an FDA process that is more cumbersome for innovations that combine devices and treatments, he said.\n\nThe senator also repeated his opposition to the \"onerous\" medical device tax levied on the industry to help finance the Affordable Care Act.\n\nAlexander is cosponsor of legislation to repeal the 2.3 percent excise tax.\n\nThe Advanced Medical Technology Association, a Washington-based trade group representing medical device, diagnostics and health information systems companies, reported that a survey of its members at the end of 2014 found negative impacts of two years of the tax.\n\nThe impacts included an estimated 18,500 fewer industry workers and a reduction in research and development by 53 percent of companies that responded to the survey. An additional 20,500 workers were projected not to be hired over the next five years.\n\nAlexander cited Tennessee Department of Economic and Community Development figures indicating that exports from Memphis-area medical device companies are the region's top export, accounting for $3.2 billion of $11.3 billion in exports.", "article_metadata": {"title": "U.S. Sen.
