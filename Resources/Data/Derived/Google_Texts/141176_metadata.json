It\u2019s Adolf Hitler or at least the carbon copy of such a dictator. And Ben Carson has been warning about it for years.\n\nOn Wednesday at a campaign stop in New Hampshire the neurosurgeon turned conservative hero warned of the potential of a Nazi-esque force coming to power in the United States. And for those who think it could never happen here, he had something he needed to say.\n\n\"I beg to differ,\" Carson said. \"If you go back and look at the history of the world, tyranny and despotism and how it starts, it has a lot to do with control of thought and control of speech.\"\n\n\"If people don't speak up for what they believe, then other people will change things without them having a voice. Hitler changed things there and nobody protested. Nobody provided any opposition to him.\"\n\nHe suggested that there is already somebody currently in the United States who is like Adolf Hitler. But is it Obama? No, of course not!\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to go into that that. I think that example is pretty clear,\u201d Carson said when asked this question. When pressed, he denied that he was implying Obama was like Hitler. \u201cNo. I am saying in a situation where people do not express themselves, bad things can happen.\u201d\n\nThis fear is not new for Carson. In fact, he\u2019s been pretty damn scared of Nazis and the potential of their ideology taking hold in his country for years. In nearly all of his several published books, he makes references to Nazi Germany and Hitler.\n\nHe often suggests that the overreaching acts of the U.S. government into the private lives of citizens could give way to a mirror image of WWII Germany.\n\nIn the 2014 classic One Nation: What We Can All Do To Save America\u2019s Future, he writes: \u201cThroughout history many societies have failed to push back and have allowed an overly aggressive government to expand and dominate their lives. Nazi Germany is a perfect example of such a society. One can only wonder what would\u2019ve happened if people had not tolerated the foolishness of Adolf Hitler\u2019s appeal to the baser instincts of greed and envy and his institution of an official weapons confiscation program.\u201d\n\nAnd it could happen soon. Dictatorial regimes in the United States are imminent.\n\n\u201cSuch domination is considerably more difficult when people have arms and can put up significant resistance,\u201d he writes in 2015\u2019s What I Believe. \u201cThis is the reason that brutal dictators like Fidel Castro, Josef Stalin, Mao Zedong, Adolf Hitler and Idi Amin tried to disarm the populace before imposing governmental control. Such domination could occur in America in the not too distant future if we are not vigilant.\u201d\n\nThe real problem is socialism, which Carson says involves people giving up their personal liberties. When that happens, the country is just steps away from a Nazi-esque takeover.\n\n\u201cSure, there are several different brands of socialism\u2014at least as many types as there are would-be people-planners who wish to impose their plans to control the moral and economic lives of other people,\u201d the doctor writes in 2014\u2019s America the Beautiful: Rediscovering What This Nation Great. \u201cBut are you willing to surrender your precious liberties to a socialist state which promises \u2018security\u2019 for everyone and government-enforced equality? Isn\u2019t this what Hitler and other socialists promised the German people in his Nazi (national socialist) platform\u2014a country in which government guarantees security and \u2018equality\u2019 in exchange for giving up individual freedom? Will Americans fall for the same scam?\n\n\u201cSince Americans are by nature individualistic and entrepreneurial, by definition, then, the socialist program is anti-American, to say nothing of totalitarian.\n\n\u201cSocialism is an old dream. Some dreams are nightmares when put into practice.\u201d\n\nGet The Beast In Your Inbox!

His campaign has not responded to a request for comment about Carson\u2019s concerns about Nazis.\n\nWhile he\u2019s generally concerned about it, Carson is a forgiving individual, one who is willing to let bygones be bygones.\n\n\u201cEvery person makes mistakes, so it should come as no surprise that every nation of the world has made mistakes as well,\u201d Carson writes in America the Beautiful, in which he also questions whether the rise of the Islamic State is similar to that of the Nazis. \u201cTalk with a German national about the hope their country placed in Hitler\u2019s rise to power on the heels of the Great Depression. Or consider our own nation\u2019s internment of Japanese-Americans during World War II, and you\u2019ll agree that the question is not whether a nation makes mistakes; the question is whether a nation learns from its mistakes, builds on that knowledge it gains over time, and grows in wisdom.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"twitter": {"site": "@thedailybeast", "card": "summary", "creator": "GideonResnick"}, "keywords": "Politics-Republican-Party, Ben Carson, Adolf Hitler", "publicationDate": 201510040401, "wrap": "/content/dailybeast/politics", "description": "The U.S. is on the verge of a Nazi-like takeover, and Ben Carson is ready to save us.", "pageNum": 1, "title": "Ben Carson: Hitler is Coming", "tags": "article:politics-republican-party,entity:person/ben_carson,entity:person/adolf_hitler", "environment": "dev", "platform": "desktop", "template": "article", "type": "house", "parsely-page": "{\"title\":\"Ben Carson: Hitler is Coming\",\"link\":\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/10/04/ben-carson-loves-hitler-references.html\",\"image_url\":\"http://cdn.thedailybeast.com/content/dailybeast/articles/2015/10/04/ben-carson-loves-hitler-references/jcr:content/image.crop.410.273.jpg/48132126.cached.jpg\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":\"/content/dailybeast/articles/2015/10/04/ben-carson-loves-hitler-references\",\"pub_date\":\"2015-10-04T04:01:00+00:00\",\"section\":\"Politics\",\"author\":\"Gideon Resnick\",\"tags\":[\"politics-republican-party\",\"ben_carson\",\"adolf_hitler\"]}", "news_keywords": "PoliticsRepublicanParty, Ben Carson, Adolf Hitler", "sectionTaxanomies": "politics", "fb": {"admins": "1703087,30000737,1117577220,1276800108,931159,514915512", "app_id": 189930913679}, "authors": "Gideon Resnick", "article": {"published_time": "2015-10-04T04:01:00.000Z", "author": "http://www.thedailybeast.com/contributors/gideon-resnickhtml"}, "resourceType": "dailybeast2/components/pages/article", "contentpath": "/content/dailybeast/articles/2015/10/04/ben-carson-loves-hitler-references", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Beast", "description": "The U.S. is on the verge of a Nazi-like takeover, and Ben Carson is ready to save us.", "title": "Ben Carson: Hitler is Coming", "url": "http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/10/04/ben-carson-loves-hitler-references.html", "image": "http://cdn.thedailybeast.com/content/dailybeast/articles/2015/10/04/ben-carson-loves-hitler-references/jcr:content/image.img.2000.jpg/1443963786672.cached.jpg", "type": "article"}, "authorIds": "/etc/authors/g/gideon-resnick", "content-type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8"}, "article_summary": "He suggested that there is already somebody currently in the United States who is like Adolf Hitler.\nOn Wednesday at a campaign stop in New Hampshire the neurosurgeon turned conservative hero warned of the potential of a Nazi-esque force coming to power in the United States.\nGODWIN'S LAWThe U.S. is on the verge of a Nazi-like takeover, and Ben Carson is ready to save us.\nThere\u2019s a great potential threat in the United States, more dangerous than the Leftist agenda and more powerful than Obamacare, immigrants and ISIS combined.\nWhile he\u2019s generally concerned about it, Carson is a forgiving individual, one who is willing to let bygones be bygones."}
