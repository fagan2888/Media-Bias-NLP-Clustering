Add specialty retailer Trader Joe’s to the list of employers who will cut health-care benefits to its part-time workers — but it’s not untethering those workers completely from coverage.

The privately held grocery chain, which had been heralded for offering benefits to its part-time employees, will give those workers $500 to help buy themselves coverage on health exchanges, according to a report in the Huffington Post.

Trader Joe’s had bucked the industry trend by offering low-cost health, dental and vision plans to its part-time workers. This new development probably will continue to set the retailer apart from its peers, however. Some companies are cutting hours and full-time positions completely in order to get under the threshold for the mandatory offering of health benefits outlined in President Obama’s health-care overhaul, formally known as the Affordable Care Act, or ACA.

Trader Joe’s had determined that government subsidies, which would have been available anyway to lower-income workers, made it impractical to continue paying for coverage itself. The Post said it obtained a confidential memo from Trader Joe’s Chief Executive Dan Bane to employees outlining the plan.

“Depending on income you may earn outside of Trader Joe’s, we believe that with the $500 from Trader Joe’s and the tax credits available under the ACA, many of you should be able to obtain health care coverage at very little if any net cost to you,” Bane wrote in the memo to workers.
