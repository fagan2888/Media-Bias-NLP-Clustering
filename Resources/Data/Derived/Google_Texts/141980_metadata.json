But prosecutors and defense attorneys say the sudden conclusion was the result of events and decisions that go back years.\n\nEighteenth Judicial District Attorney George Brauchler withdrew the death penalty on Thursday, and in exchange Montour pleaded guilty to first-degree murder for killing corrections officer Eric Autobee in 2002. Montour, who originally pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity, was immediately sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole.\n\nMontour was serving a life sentence for killing his infant daughter when he beat Autobee to death at Limon Correctional Facility. During jury selection, defense attorneys introduced evidence they say prove Montour was wrongfully convicted and sent to prison in 1998.\n\nBrauchler said Douglas County District Judge Richard Caschette\u2019s decision not to delay the trial and allow him to gather experts who would prove the infant died of abuse \u201chamstrung\u201d prosecutors. As a result, he worried jurors would not only fail to sentence Montour to death, but might also find him guilty of a lesser charge or conclude he was insane.\n\nThe plea agreement stirred a mix of emotions in court Thursday. Defense attorneys smiled and cried as Montour was sentenced, but prosecutors called the sentence \u201cpartial justice.\u201d\n\nThe total cost of the case \u2014 including defense and court expenses \u2014 was not available Friday, but the district attorney\u2019s office estimates prosecution cost was around $1.2 million. The Department of Corrections has a contract with district attorneys to prosecute crimes in prison, and the funds used to prosecute Montour were reimbursed by the DOC to the four counties that house Brauchler\u2019s office.\n\nBrauchler is also seeking the death penalty against Aurora movie theater shooter James Holmes, who has pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity.\n\nThe total, average cost of a first-degree murder trial without the death penalty is about $150,000, according to research from Coloradans for Alternatives to the Death Penalty Foundation.\n\nDefense attorney David Lane said Montour was willing to plead guilty for years in exchange for dropping the death penalty, and prosecutors\u2019 relentless pursuit of the death penalty cost the state millions.\n\nBut Brauchler said his office didn\u2019t hire additional attorneys to work on Montour\u2019s case. Attorneys on the case handled 472 defense motions \u2014 295 of which required extensive litigation \u2014 filed since 2007.\n\nMontour originally pleaded guilty, and a judge sentenced him to death in 2003. The Colorado Supreme Court reversed that decision in 2007, and the case eventually fell back to square one in April 2013.\n\nJohn Blume, director of the Cornell Law School\u2019s Death Penalty Project, said Montour\u2019s case was not rare. There is no precise data, but Blume said in cases in which a death sentence is reversed, about 75 percent of them end in some type of plea agreement.\n\n\u201cSometimes the prospect of doing something again is not very appealing to anyone,\u201d Blume said.\n\nJordan Steffen: 303-954-1794, jsteffen@denverpost.com or twitter.com/jsteffendp", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Abrupt end to Montour death penalty case still carries large price", "title": "Abrupt end to Montour death penalty case still carries large price", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/03/07/abrupt-end-to-montour-death-penalty-case-still-carries-large-price/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140305__20140306_A4_CD06MONTOURp1-2.jpg", "height": 452}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140305__20140306_A4_CD06MONTOURp1-2.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-03-07T17:05:16+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-28T02:35:24+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "The total, average cost of a first-degree murder trial without the death penalty is about $150,000, according to research from Coloradans for Alternatives to the Death Penalty Foundation.\nBut prosecutors and defense attorneys say the sudden conclusion was the result of events and decisions that go back years.\nJohn Blume, director of the Cornell Law School\u2019s Death Penalty Project, said Montour\u2019s case was not rare.\nDefense attorney David Lane said Montour was willing to plead guilty for years in exchange for dropping the death penalty, and prosecutors\u2019 relentless pursuit of the death penalty cost the state millions.\nThere is no precise data, but Blume said in cases in which a death sentence is reversed, about 75 percent of them end in some type of plea agreement."}
