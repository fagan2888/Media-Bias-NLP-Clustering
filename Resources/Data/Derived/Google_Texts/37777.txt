Your Tuesday editorial, “Sanders’ lavish ‘Medicare for All,’” contained some hard truths and some distorted facts. Yes, it would be impossible to get congressional Republicans to vote for such a plan as a single-payer health system. But you distorted the facts when you compared our health care system to Britain and Canada. The UK has had a single-payer system since 1948. Its leaders during this time period have been all over the political spectrum from liberal to conservative. All saw the necessity of treating each patient from birth without regard to ability to pay. And their life expectancy is higher than ours is today. Canada’s life expectancy is also higher than ours. And about the 52,000 Canadians who “sought treatment abroad” — that is .0015 of the entire population of Canada, a figure so statistically small as to be insignificant.

Our hodgepodge system of medical “plans” work for those with money. Obamacare has helped nearly 17 million people who had nothing before. Health care professionals are being crushed under the administrative weight of competing plans. When will America join the rest of the civilized world?
