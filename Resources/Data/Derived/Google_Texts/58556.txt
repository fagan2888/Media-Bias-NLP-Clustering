Black Friday is one of the most profitable times of the year for businesses. It's one day shoppers can get big savings on big ticket items virtually everywhere.

Local businesses also offered deals to keep up competitively on one of the most lucrative days of the year.

Bernie Gordon headed to Hooper Electronics to capitalize on discounts. For months he says he has had to go without a car stereo. When he heard about a promotion offered on Black Friday, Gordon decided to purchase new speakers.

“It was like, you buy them, then they install them free,” said Gordon.

Allen Hunt is the general manager of Hooper's. He says anything a customer bought in the store would be installed for free. He says shoppers try to avoid labor fees by purchasing items online. Hunt says with this deal, they're guaranteeing customers quality installments.

Shoppers also looked to local retail businesses to hunt for those one of a kind gifts. Sales associate Payton Cornish worked the floor at Belle G; plenty of their seasonal items were marked down.

"It’s a good idea to get things at a discount price. That way you don’t have to pay the regular price," said Cornish.

Business owner, Harry Mayer, says when customers shop locally, they get a chance to support their community.

“Black Friday is a huge day for us. November and December are such a vital part in any retail business. It is a strong shopping day from here on in,” said Mayer.

This is predicted to be the most productive spending time of the year. Following Black Friday is Small Business Saturday, then Cyber Monday.
