Fathers may want to have a few tissues ready when they watch Dove Men+Care’s Super Bowl ad.

The Unilever-owned men’s personal care brand released its big game spot on Tuesday. The “Real Strength” commercial shows children of all ages affectionately calling out for their dads as they go through big and small life landmarks, conveying the message that caring for others makes a man stronger. The Super Bowl spot will feature a voiceover from ESPN broadcaster Mike Greenberg.

Dove Men+Care’s 30-second commercial will run in the first-quarter of the Feb. 1 game. The spot is a new take on the brand’s Father’s Day campaign, which also focused on kids’ special moments with their dads.
