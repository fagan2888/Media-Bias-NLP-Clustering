Calls for economic patriotism are not going to stop these \u201cinversions.\u201d The U.S. has the developed world\u2019s highest corporate tax rate, and it taxes operations overseas differently than our competitors do; that\u2019s what is driving our companies away.\n\nLegislative efforts to raise the standards companies must meet to invert, or reduce their tax benefits if they do, would not address the fundamental problems in the tax code that are driving money overseas.\n\nInstead of punishing companies for moving abroad, we should be creating an environment in which they can succeed.\n\nThe best way to stop inversions is to enact comprehensive tax reform. Specifically, we should broaden the tax base, lower rates, tax foreign operations more like other countries do, and create a stable, competitive international tax system.\n\nIt is no coincidence that moves toward inversions picked up after it became clear that tax reform would not happen this year. The message is that Washington, rather than solving problems, accepts lurching from crisis to crisis.\n\nWhat\u2019s needed is a strategic pause: Corporate America and lawmakers could agree to a nine-month hiatus. Companies would pledge not to move forward on plans to invert, and lawmakers could use a fast-track process to substantively reform the tax code. Companies would have little to lose, as they would still be able to change their legal structure after the pause, and a deadline could help move tax reform along.\n\nWhile tax reform is hard\u2013pitting companies, industries and interests against each other\u2013there has already been a great deal of progress.\n\nPresident Barack Obama, former senator Max Baucus, House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dave Camp and Senate Finance Committee Chairman Ron Wyden all have put forth proposals that would cut tax preferences and lower the corporate rate. They would reevaluate our tax code\u2019s treatment of overseas earnings. And all would attempt to make the tax code simpler and more economically competitive.\n\nOperating in the global marketplace, the U.S. has to think more deeply about how and what it taxes. While many complain that \u201ccorporations don\u2019t pay their fair share,\u201d the reality is that corporate taxes are passed on to customers, employees and shareholders. And as borders become more porous and corporate structures and capital become more mobile, corporate taxes increasingly encourage inefficient and costly behavior.\n\nA smarter approach\u2013one that will take time\u2013would be to shift more of the corporate tax onto wealthy individuals and those who earn much of their income from gains in the corporate sector. The first step would be to eliminate tax breaks for the well-off and equalize the treatment of wages and capital, which would be preferable to further raising marginal rates. Over the long term, this kind of shift would merit a more radical rethinking of the way the individual and corporate income taxes interact. Any tax changes should capture at least as much revenue as is raised now\u2014and hopefully more, as part of a broader deal to fix the budget\u2013and in a way that is at least as progressive as the current code.\n\nMaya MacGuineas is president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.
