(Photo: KYLE GRANTHAM/THE NEWS JOURNAL)Buy Photo\n\nDelaware\u2019s 45 independent pharmacies, small medical practices and patients are struggling with the state\u2019s efforts to reform health care.\n\nIn some cases, those changes are putting the businesses on the precipice of going out of business.\n\nTake pharmacist Sheila Tucker. She thought she had done everything right.\n\nShe studied long and hard to become a pharmacist, helping make Market Street Pharmacy a mainstay in downtown Wilmington for the past 11 years. She\u2019s a friendly face in the community and loves her job.\n\nBut at the start of the new year she was shocked when she checked her financial statements.\n\nMarket Street Pharmacy\u2019s Medicaid dispensing reimbursement fee \u2013 a payment for filling each prescription for subsidized patients and a crucial source of operating funds \u2013 had dropped without warning from $10 to 85 cents under the Highmark Blue Cross Blue Shield of Delaware Medicaid plan, the state\u2019s new managed care organization for 2015.\n\nAbout 75 percent of her regular patients are on Medicaid, a bulk on Highmark\u2019s plan. Like many other providers who have a large number of Medicaid patients and customers, Tucker said the changes will force her to cut workers. She said she might even have to close down.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really a slap in the face to pharmacies,\u201d Tucker said. \u201cThey are putting the independent pharmacies out of business. It\u2019s like telling me what I went to school for was a total loss.\u201d\n\nAt the end of 2014, the state dropped its contract with Delaware Physicians Care Medicaid in favor of Highmark for the next three years. It kept its Medicaid contract with United Healthcare.\n\nState officials said Highmark and United Healthcare are more closely aligned with their views for reforming health care delivery in Delaware, emphasizing efficient and quality service at a reasonable cost. The two managed care organizations\u2019 contracts total about $1.6 billion in state and federal dollars.\n\nEach has the latitude to set its own Medicaid fee schedules which are then certified by the state and feds. Smaller pharmacies and physicians\u2019 offices have said United\u2019s fee schedule did not change drastically from last year. Only the new Highmark offering has been causing issues.\n\nDelawareans on Medicaid could choose to enroll in either plan or be automatically assigned during open enrollment through last Nov. 26. As of Tuesday, 77,454 Delawareans are on Highmark\u2019s plan and 117,067 are on United Healthcare\u2019s plan.\n\nPharmacies and doctors who cater to Medicaid patients might be forced to stop, putting the people who need that access the most at risk.\n\nFor most seniors and Delawareans on fixed incomes, the choice already comes down to do I buy my medication or pay my electric bill, said Paul Calistro, executive director of the West End Neighborhood House in Wilmington. He sees the struggle every day as the organization helps those scraping to get by find stable employment, housing and health care. People have to hold off buying cancer drugs or immunodefficiency pills.\n\n\u201cI think the seniors and the poor are the pawns in this,\u201d he said. \u201cThese are the folks that are most affected by it and caught in the middle.\u201d\n\nHe doesn\u2019t think there will be a point where pharmacies in Delaware won\u2019t accept government insurance. But he acknowledged that the average person, whether he or she is on Medicaid or not, will have a lot of trouble navigating the ebb and flow of health care changes. His own employees have had double-digit increases to their health care plans for the last 10 years, even before the Affordable Care Act was signed into law.\n\n\u201cEvery year was a different story,\u201d he said.\n\nPrivate physician and specialist practices are seeing their reimbursement fees sliced just like independent pharmacies under the new Highmark offering. Some practices have stopped taking patients enrolled in Highmark\u2019s Medicaid plan altogether in order to stabilize their finances.\n\nThe business models for health care providers should be balanced, said Steve Groff, director of Delaware\u2019s Division of Medicaid and Medical Assistance. He is uncomfortable with providers who are too dependent on government funding for their profit margins.\n\n\u201cThat suggests to me that they are either building a business around Medicaid or Medicaid is supplementing what they are receiving from other payers, neither of which is a good thing,\u201d he said.\n\nBut the problem is not just about money: If smaller pharmacies and medical practices shut down, patients will have fewer options and could face a lapse in treatment.\n\nSince Jan. 1, Jason Kautz, of Wilmington, has been surviving on a steady supply of three-day emergency Paxil pills from his Walgreens pharmacy. He takes the medication to manage severe seizures.\n\nKautz, who switched to Highmark\u2019s Medicaid program, has been unable to get his prescription authorized under the new insurer.\n\n\u201cIf it\u2019s not covered I don\u2019t know what to do,\u201d he said. \u201cThey [the pharmacists] give me three more and pretty much tell me to hope for the best.\u201d\n\nProblems with Highmark\u2019s fee schedule came to a head at the January Delaware Health Care Commission meeting, a monthly forum for doctors, hospital officials, insurance companies, patient advocates and policy analysts.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t change your budget. We laid off two people,\u201d said Lynne Grajewski, chief operating officer of Women\u2019s First, an organization that manages four obstetric and gynecologic practices throughout the state, to the crowd of stakeholders gathered at Delaware Technical Community College in Dover Jan. 8.\n\nShe\u2019s been happy with Highmark\u2019s commercial plans and there have been no problems with United\u2019s reimbursement rates or prescription authorizations, she said. It\u2019s Highmark\u2019s new fee structure for the Medicaid plan that is causing problems.\n\nShe said her practices no longer accept new patients on Highmark\u2019s Medicaid plan and are only continuing to see select Highmark patients if they were midway through certain treatments like prenatal well-checks or birth control injections.\n\n\u201cSome of them were due to have their babies in January. We are not going to say go find another doctor when you were due in a week,\u201d she said.\n\nDelaware Health Secretary Rita Landgraf defended Highmark during the meeting, saying Highmark\u2019s rates were \u201cactuarially sound,\u201d fair and approved by the state and federal governments. Due to company policy, Highmark declined to provide its rate structure.\n\nIt\u2019s no secret health care costs are rising \u2013 higher Medicaid enrollment alone will cost state taxpayers another $24 million \u2013 so officials need to get creative to stop the cost from spiraling, she said.\n\n\u201cWe need to be really vigilant as to how we drive that cost and get better quality,\u201d Landgraf said in an interview following the meeting.\n\nProviders are getting pinched not only by Medicaid, but by reforms central to the Affordable Care Act, says Kip Piper, a D.C.-based health care consultant and former senior adviser to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. The quality standard of insurance plans has increased, but the premiums inevitably have to go up to make up the difference.\n\n\u201cYou can pass all the laws you want, but you are not changing the laws of gravity,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIf you are trying to fit millions of more people, while at the same time paying less money, you are narrowing the network. A lot of these smaller providers may be on fewer and fewer plan networks. The plans are driving people into the larger practices.\u201d\n\nMid-range and larger practices are in a better position to \u201ctransform\u201d health care, Piper said. They have more technology, funding and support to deal with market changes.\n\n\u201cFor smaller physician practices, it\u2019s harder to do,\u201d he said.\n\nDelaware just secured a $35 million federal grant to fund a state innovation plan to significantly change the way health care is offered and how it is paid for.\n\nThe change is centered on becoming more \u201cperformance-based,\u201d which goes hand-in-hand with tort reform to reduce unnecessary tests and streamline services so patients do not have to keep repeating their medical histories to doctors.\n\nSince day one, Highmark has been a strong, active participant and supporter of the state\u2019s innovation model, Highmark spokesman Matt Stehl said in an email message.\n\n\u201cAs a Medicaid provider, we will meet our obligation to the state by continuing our work in support of the triple aim of improving the health of Delawareans, improving the patient experience of care and reducing health care costs,\u201d he said.\n\nMike Walsh, owner of a small physical therapy clinic in Dover, said Highmark has delivered in terms of customer service. Medical claims have been processing, and though he hasn\u2019t been paid, one-time patient appointments and medication authorizations have been smooth.\n\n\u201cWe are cautiously optimistic, that\u2019s the best way to put it,\u201d Walsh said.\n\nIn December, he thought his practice would be inundated with Highmark patients since they are one of only, if not the only, small physical therapy practice in Kent County taking the Highmark Medicaid plan. So far he has eight Highmark Medicaid patients and 24 United patients.\n\nWalsh said he suspects the low number of Highmark patients reflects what is happening on the physician referral side; physicians are not taking Highmark\u2019s Medicaid plan and as a result, the patients go elsewhere.\n\n\u201cWe are kind of sitting there holding our breath,\u201d he said.\n\nHighmark says about 85 percent of providers in the commercial market have opted into its Medicaid network, but some physicians say that might not be accurate.\n\nGrajewski said the insurer asked providers to sign letters of intent to be included in the new network directory for patients, without showing the fee schedules. Walsh echoed similar sentiments, saying the public provider directory is still not updated.\n\n\u201cThere was a lot of misinformation out there,\u201d Grajewski said.\n\nGroff acknowledged that Highmark \u201cshould have gotten the rate schedule out sooner rather than later, but they do have the rate schedule out there now. Providers are free to contract with them or not.\u201d\n\nThe state concluded that Highmark and United have sufficient plans in place, but Groff said they will be monitored through the end of March.\n\nAfter that time, the state will assess the plans to see how many people are enrolled in each, where they live and what types of services are getting reimbursed. If either plan lacks enrollees or providers, the state will step in, Groff said. Penalties could include fines.\n\n\u201cI would certainly hope that wouldn\u2019t happen,\u201d he said.\n\nEven if a practice like Women\u2019s First does not technically take Highmark Medicaid, physicians can still see long-term patients on that plan who need to continue their treatments. After the treatment is complete, however, those patients can no longer be accepted. Patients will have until March 31 to switch Medicaid plans to best fit their needs.\n\nProviders hope the situation gets better.\n\nOn Dec. 31, Pat Carroll-Grant, of Cape Pharmacy in Lewes, received a $10 dispensing fee. On Jan. 1, it was $1.50.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really not able to see what I can do,\u201d Carroll-Grant said. \u201cThis is on top of the fact that pharmacies are trying to make this a smooth transition for patients. If you asked me today how I am being paid I would not know the answer.\u201d\n\nShe acknowledged there had to be costs cut somewhere, but was not happy with the lack of transparency.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very disheartening. Because we are a small state, our pharmacists have always stepped up. We try to take care of a lot of issues. Did it just happen to independents or did it happen to the big chains,\u201d she said.\n\nWalgreens operates 64 drugstores in Delaware. A spokesman said \u201cfor competitive reasons\u201d he would not disclose its pricing structure or fee schedule.\n\nHighmark\u2019s Stehl said provider relations representatives would work to address any concerns, but didn\u2019t know if that would include amending the Medicaid reimbursement rates.\n\nAt the end of the day, the back-and-forth makes it more difficult to take care of patients, said Kevin Musto, owner of Atlantic Apothecary in Smyrna.\n\n\u201cI want to take care of my patients. At the same time, I have to support my overhead, rent, utilities and payroll,\u201d he said.\n\nPractices and pharmacies will have to cut corners in order to make ends meet. Bottles and vials all cost money, he said. Atlantic doesn\u2019t keep a large inventory either; they will put in a medication order in the same week they dispense it.\n\nWho knows, maybe he will have to start handing out medication in plastic cups, he joked.\n\n\u201cWhen you go to your doctor and get a well visit and sick visit, you expect them to take care of you and make sure you are thoroughly evaluated. If we start to shortchange health care and not pay for the service you need, then some people won\u2019t be as thorough,\u201d Musto said.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want patients to go to the hospitals. ... When you diminish the value of the pharmacy I think the patient loses out on the outcome because they may use the medication wrong.\u201d\n\nWilmington resident Shanice Reed was assigned to Highmark Medicaid after her Delaware Physicians Care ended Dec. 31. She\u2019s already had problems getting prescriptions, and might have to leave the Women\u2019s First practice in Wilmington, an OB/GYN practice she\u2019s gone to for the last five years.\n\nLast Thursday she was in for her last appointment \u2013 a Depo-Provera birth control shot.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to have to see what I can do,\u201d she said.\n\nHer partner Naaffi Ames kept their daughter, A\u2019Mina, less than a year old, busy while she was seen. He\u2019s frustrated with the insurance situation, too. He said he only got a letter in the mail about the state\u2019s Medicaid switch in November and there was no information about which doctors\u2019 appointments or prescriptions will be covered.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t survive if I don\u2019t know what tools I have to survive with,\u201d he said.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://delonline.us/1JByHA6", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Change in insurer cuts into bottom line of small pharmacies and doctors\u2019 offices", "p": {"domain_verify": "815a1068696ac12ba65bd5231740d78d"}, "og": {"site_name": "delawareonline", "description": "Change in insurer cuts into bottom line of small pharmacies and doctors\u2019 offices", "title": "Medicaid \u2018efficiencies\u2019 cause more pain", "url": "http://www.delawareonline.com/story/news/local/2015/01/24/medicaid-efficiencies-cause-pain/22278145/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/delawareonline.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Change in insurer cuts into bottom line of small pharmacies and doctors\u2019 offices", "title": "Medicaid \u2018efficiencies\u2019 cause more pain", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/6d7111233d426798574ec10242dd79aa2dca8850/c=373-0-1627-1254&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/Wilmington/2015/01/24/B9315762123Z.1_20150124195141_000_GVR9K9JBF.1-0.jpg", "creator": "@delawareonline", "site": "@delawareonline", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600071892", "fb": {"app_id": 175037755863662}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": "pharmacy, medicaid, wilmington, dover, highmark, united healthcare"}, "article_summary": "So far he has eight Highmark Medicaid patients and 24 United patients.\nKautz, who switched to Highmark\u2019s Medicaid program, has been unable to get his prescription authorized under the new insurer.\nSome practices have stopped taking patients enrolled in Highmark\u2019s Medicaid plan altogether in order to stabilize their finances.\nThe business models for health care providers should be balanced, said Steve Groff, director of Delaware\u2019s Division of Medicaid and Medical Assistance.\nLike many other providers who have a large number of Medicaid patients and customers, Tucker said the changes will force her to cut workers."}
