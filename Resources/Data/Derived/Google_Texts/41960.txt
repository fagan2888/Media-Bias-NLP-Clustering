WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Sen. Tim Scott announced Monday his co-sponsorship of the Hire More Heroes Act, legislation that, if passed, will provide incentives encouraging companies to hire more American veterans, while providing relief from what he called the “burdensome Obamacare employer mandate.”

“Our brave men and women in uniform should not be hindered from good employment opportunities when they return home because of Obamacare and its burdensome mandates on employers,” Scott said. “The Hire More Heroes Act is a common-sense piece of legislation that will ensure that the healthcare our veterans receive through TRICARE or the VA is not counted toward the Obamacare employer mandate threshhold, which will help encourage small businesses to hire more veterans.”
