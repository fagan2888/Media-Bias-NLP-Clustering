Matthew Cartwright speaks during a town-hall-style meeting at the Sovereign Majestic Theater in Pottsville, Pa., to discuss the federal health-care law. (Sean Simmers/For The Washington Post)\n\nRep. Matthew Cartwright (D-Pa.) is in Congress today because of the Affordable Care Act. He did not vote for it, but he won because the veteran moderate Democrat he challenged in a primary voted against it. That\u2019s the kind of deep-blue district he now represents.\n\nCartwright spent his first year in office preparing constituents for \u201cthe ACA\u201d \u2014 he never calls it \u201cObamacare\u201d \u2014 and reminding them to sign up for benefits at HealthCare.gov.\n\nHe hoped to spend time during an extended October recess helping people sign up for health insurance, but a sputtering Web site and broken campaign promises are forcing him to defend the law. He still believes in the law and his support remains strong, but he knows the troubled rollout has shaken his constituents\u2019 confidence.\n\n\u201cIf you want to give me a good faceful for one of my political positions, I can take it,\u201d he told about 100 of them gathered inside a small community theater Friday.\n\nFrom the stage, Cartwright said President Obama \u201cwas out over his ski tips\u201d when he said Americans would be able to keep their health-care plans if they liked them. In reality, \u201cif you like your policy, and it still remains grandfathered in, and it doesn\u2019t change, and it applies within the law, then you can keep it,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd he should have said that.\u201d\n\n\u201cShoulda, woulda, coulda!\u201d a woman shouted from the front rows.\n\n\u201cHe should have said that,\u201d Cartwright said again for emphasis.\n\nEmbarrassed and frustrated by the early weeks of the health insurance exchange\u2019s rollout, Cartwright is still convinced that the law will work, so he is fighting back with information and brutal honesty.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m the last person who\u2019s going to sit here and say this is a perfect law,\u201d he told the crowd. \u201cBut it is the law, and it\u2019s up to us to wrap our hands around it, to get together and learn about it and to do the best for Americans under this law.\u201d\n\nCartwright\u2019s district is generally a liberal Democratic counterpoint to those ruby-red Republican districts represented by the law\u2019s biggest critics. But in this corner of the district, he is treated skeptically. Pottsville is the headquarters of Yuengling beer and a town where the local Dunkin\u2019 Donuts and auto body shop are adorned with murals depicting a bygone, more robust era.\n\nIt is also home to moderate Democrats and Republicans who liked their Democratic former congressman, Rep. Tim Holden. For roughly 20 years, Holden attracted bipartisan support by maintaining a moderate voting record. He survived the 2010 tea party wave by voting against the health-care law.\n\nBut last year, Cartwright took advantage of a redrawn map that packed more liberal Democrats into Holden\u2019s district. Backed by MoveOn.org, Cartwright mounted a challenge against Holden from the left, turning the primary into a referendum on his vote against the Affordable Care Act. Cartwright later defeated his GOP opponent by campaigning on the merits of the law.\n\n\u201cI fully expect there to be plenty of kinks in the law that probably during the balance of my political career we will be sorting out,\u201d he told skeptics and supporters Friday.\n\nCartwright fielded 14 questions about the health law over 90 minutes. He was flanked onstage by Athena Ford, advocacy director for the Pennsylvania Health Access Network, and Jim Palmquist, president of the Pennsylvania chapter of AARP. Ford and Palmquist deftly answered detailed questions about coverage and eligibility requirements while Cartwright dealt with rumor control.\n\nAre lawmakers exempt from the new law? \u201cWe are not,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s very clear that I will be enrolling in the Affordable Care Act.\u201d\n\nIs the Internal Revenue Service competent enough to enforce the penalties for not signing up for insurance? \u201cAll they\u2019re being asked to do under this system is to keep track of tax credits and tax deductions,\u201d he said.\n\nInviting local professionals to handle the detailed questions was smart, said Bruce Marianelli, 63, one of many Republicans who showed up for the meeting.\n\n\u201cIf it was just him onstage, I don\u2019t think he would have left here with skin on,\u201d Marianelli said.\n\nDusan Neumann, 68, agreed. \u201cI hardly can understand that a government that can eavesdrop on the private conversations of Angela Merkel cannot put together a decent Web site that a 15-year old Chinese hacker could hack in 15 minutes,\u201d he said.\n\nNeumann did not vote for Cartwright last year, but after listening to the congressman he said: \u201cHe scored better than I would expect. He was able to admit that there are serious flaws.\u201d\n\nAnd even some of Cartwright\u2019s Republican critics said they learned something.\n\n\u201cYou know what I learned? The fact that there are still people who will be uninsured,\u201d said Dorothy Daubert, 70. \u201cI just assumed this was going to cover everybody or else they\u2019d be on Medicaid.\u201d\n\nThe presentation was exactly what Cartwright\u2019s liberal Democratic supporters wanted to see. Guy Anthony, 61, eagerly wants the health law to succeed and refuses to believe television news reports about the early struggles. \u201cIf Apple had come up with a new iPod and the Web site was so jammed because everybody wanted it and they couldn\u2019t get through, it\u2019d be called a raving success,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cDemocrats should be a lot more aggressive and a lot more assertive in defending their positions,\u201d Anthony added later. \u201cOne thing that\u2019s true of Republicans \u2014 it\u2019s a strength \u2014 is that they know how to stick together and move their agenda forward, whereas the Democrats do not. They\u2019re too wishy-washy.\u201d\n\nDemocratic leaders in Washington anticipated that Republicans would mount fresh attacks on the health-care law this fall. While Cartwright\u2019s presentation appeared homespun, the format and messaging were ripped from a playbook prepared by House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and her top lieutenants.\n\nMuch of the information Cartwright is using during a series of public information sessions comes from an online \u201ctool kit\u201d accessible only to Democratic lawmakers and their staffs. The site includes reams of data, talking points, academic research about the law and local news reports touting success stories.\n\nCaucus leaders also have hosted more than 20 closed-door sessions about the health law since February. A schedule provided by senior Democratic aides lists meetings about Medicare and Medicaid led by staffers from the Kaiser Family Foundation, at least four huddles on \u201cACA messaging\u201d and several discussions with the Obama administration\u2019s top health-care advisers.\n\nHealth and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius met with the caucus in late June and later fielded questions from Cartwright and other freshmen over dinner at the Capital Grille. White House Chief of Staff Dennis McDonough met twice with House Democrats to discuss the law in September and October. Vice President Biden huddled with freshmen nervous about the troubled Web site over dinner at the Capitol last Monday.\n\nIn an interview, Cartwright said that he attended most of the sessions and that Democratic leaders \u201chave just been doing a phenomenal job\u201d preparing rank-and-file members. But he said that the Web site launch \u201cwas an embarrassment\u201d and that Obama\u2019s promise about individual health-care plans was \u201cunfortunate\u201d and \u201ca bit of puffing salesmanship.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think people appreciate honesty, and there are a couple of things we have to surrender, throw up the white flag about,\u201d he said.\n\nDespite the setbacks, Cartwright is clear about his bottom line. \u201cThe big picture is that ACA is a great thing, and in the long run it\u2019s going to be one of the greatest things for this country,\u201d he said. \u201cHistory will smile on the ACA.\u201d\n\nPaul Kane contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Rep.
