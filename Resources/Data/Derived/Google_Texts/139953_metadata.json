Queues and long delays in and out of the existing car parks have become common as visitor numbers have swelled.\n\nThe college\u2019s vice-principal for customer services and marketing, Peter White, said: \u201cThe city is a thriving place and with a programme of exciting events all year round as well as the forthcoming Rugby World Cup this year, parking becomes a premium, so we are really pleased that we can support the city and our neighbours, Gloucester Quays, in this way.\u201d\n\nThe new pay and display car park is managed externally by NSGL Parking and will cost \u00a32 for a maximum of two hours, \u00a34 for a maximum of four hours, \u00a36 for a maximum of six hours and \u00a310 for six hours or more during weekdays.\n\nDrivers can park their cars for \u00a31 during weekday evenings from 4.30pm until 10pm or \u00a310 for six hours or more.\n\nThe Eastgate shopping centre and King\u2019s Walk both charge \u00a31.30 for one hour, \u00a32 for two hours, \u00a33 for three hours, \u00a34 for hours and \u00a36 for the whole day.\n\nCity councillor Paul Toleman (C, Westgate) said: \u201cI am all in favour of this. It will be ideal when we have events on at Gloucester Quays it can be extremely difficult for drivers to move and find somewhere to park.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "MORE room for shoppers in Gloucester has been made thanks to new public car parking spaces.
