Short bursts of intense rain are responsible for the flash flooding, Whitehair said in the statement, which makes it difficult to predict where it will happen. And drought has hardened the ground so much that the water has no place to go.\n\n\u201cWe need everyone to exercise caution and be alert to their surroundings. Though it might not be raining in your area, it can be raining in areas upstream,\u201d Whitehair said in the Nation\u2019s statement. \u201cAnd with the long term drought, the ground is hard so there is no where for the water to go.\u201d\n\nAs many as 50 chapters have requested assistance in Arizona, New Mexico and Utah, the Navajo Nation said, with 22 people evacuated in Chinle, 40 evacuated or rescued in Many Farms and Rock Point, and 20 homes damaged in Tonalea, Arizona. Chinle residents were returning home on Friday September 13.\n\nEven with floodwaters subsiding, however, homes were still plagued by mud, rain, mold and infestation, according to reports.\n\nThe Nation is looking for volunteers to help in shelters and other flood-recuperation efforts, according to a statement issued on Friday September 13. Between 50 and 80 homes are within the flash flood areas, and many families had been displaced, the Nation said.\n\nVolunteers can contact the Navajo Nation Department of Emergency Management Emergency Operation Center at 505-371-8415, 505-371- 8416, 505-371-8417.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Parts of the Navajo Nation are recovering after severe flooding caused by heavy rain in the reservation\u2019s Central Agency area, displacing families and affecting people in Flash flooding on Navajo Nation displaces scores, wrecks homes, covers hogans in mud, mold and infestation.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.creator": "theresa", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2013/09/14/flash-flooding-navajo-nation-displaces-scores-wrecks-homes-mold-and-mud-151282", "type": "article", "image": "http://d1jrw5jterzxwu.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/article_media/navajo_nation_flooding-shellypr.jpg", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "title": "Flash Flooding on Navajo Nation Displaces Scores, Wrecks Homes With Mold and Mud"}, "dcterms.date": "2013-09-14T10:30-04:00", "dc": {"title": "Flash Flooding on Navajo Nation Displaces Scores, Wrecks Homes With Mold and Mud"}, "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2013/09/14/flash-flooding-navajo-nation-displaces-scores-wrecks-homes-mold-and-mud-151282", "robots": "follow, index", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "flash floods, flash flooding, Navajo, Navajo Nation, disaster, natural disaster, extreme weather", "validation_code": "d9d37d7b776cc351c4025ded3df21cad", "sioc": {"num_replies": 2}, "dcterms.title": "Flash Flooding on Navajo Nation Displaces Scores, Wrecks Homes With Mold and Mud"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2d34\"", "article_summary": "Volunteers can contact the Navajo Nation Department of Emergency Management Emergency Operation Center at 505-371-8415, 505-371- 8416, 505-371-8417.\nBetween 50 and 80 homes are within the flash flood areas, and many families had been displaced, the Nation said.\nRELATED: President Obama Signs Disaster Declaration for Navajo Nation, the Second Tribe to Receive Direct FEMA AssistanceHorses Dying as Navajo Nation Declares Drought EmergencyThe water issues are not unconnected, said Navajo Department of Emergency Management Director Rose Whitehair.\nThe Navajo Nation has been plagued with water woes ranging from a years-long drought, to a winter deep freeze that disrupted water supply, to the current inundation.\nEven with floodwaters subsiding, however, homes were still plagued by mud, rain, mold and infestation, according to reports."}
