Brandon Busteed, executive director of education practice at Gallup, said the idea came from the fact that United States university presidents had told him they had no real method of determining whether students felt their education had enriched their lives.\n\nNo one, Busteed told Times Higher Education, had \u201ctried to do what seems to be the most important thing, which is to ask these graduates how they are doing.\u201d\n\nThe Gallup poll will survey 30,000 people nationwide to try and discover whether they think their education improved their lives, leading to success and happiness. Several universities \u2013 Purdue is the only one that has publicly said it is involved \u2013 will then survey their own students and measure the results against the national data.\n\nThe survey intends to look beyond just financial outcomes. Questions will include:\n\nDo you like what you do at work each day?\n\nIs it what you are best at?\n\nHow would rate your life satisfaction on a scale of one to 10?\n\nAre you recognized for improving your community?\n\nBusteed told Inside Higher Education that Gallup is not trying to \u201csuggest that colleges and universities are responsible for 100% of your great job and great life. But obviously if you to college and you get a degree, the odds are you increase the probabilities of a good outcome.\u201d\n\nSupporters of the survey say it will take a larger view on how college impacts a student\u2019s life. Purdue University professor Mitch Daniels told Inside Higher Education that the survey was the responsible thing for the university to do in order to determine the quality of the educational experience at Purdue.\n\nHe added that Purdue owes future students and businesses who might hired their graduates this kind of research.\n\nThe results of the survey are expected to be published this spring.\n\nSources:\n\nhttp://www.insidehighered.com/news/2013/12/17/gallup-purdue-study-will-measure-graduates-quality-life-outcomes\n\nhttp://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/news/gallup-launches-graduate-satisfaction-survey-in-us/2011742.article\n\nPlease follow and like us:\n\nPlease Leave A Comment\n\ncomments", "article_metadata": {"description": "A new Galllup survey underway this spring will determine students satisfaction with the education they have received.
