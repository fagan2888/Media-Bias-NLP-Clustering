He was taken from his mother as an infant and recently died at the zoo, and PETA is searching for answers.\n\nPETA said, Chico was secluded for years and suddenly died November 3, which prompted PETA to send a letter to the U.S. Department of Agriculture to investigate the death.\n\nThe Waccatee Zoo has been monitored by PETA for years. In recent months, PETA alerted the USDA to numerous apparent AWA violations at the facility, including bears with large amounts of hair loss confined to dirty concrete enclosures, primates who were pulling out their hair and circling tiny cages in apparent psychological distress, and a severely overweight cougar who was in apparent need of veterinary attention.\n\nPETA said they offered to move Chico repeatedly to an accredited sanctuary where he would have had chimpanzee companionship's and the appropriate veterinary care that could have saved his life.\n\nChimpanzees similar to Chico are being held in similar depressing and potentially dangerous conditions, PETA said.\n\n\"The owners of Wacatee Zoo declined to comment on the incident involving Chico. They did say that they have not been investigated by anyone thus far, and maintain they have done nothing wrong. They also claim that they have not been contacted by PETA since 2001.\"\n\nCopyright 2015 WMBF News.
