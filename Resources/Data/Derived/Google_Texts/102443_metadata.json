To get to the next level in our lives, we are trying to \u201cattract\u201d people: investors, employees, voters, customers, suppliers, friends, a mate, Facebook friends, Twitter followers, etc. Of course, we need to turn up the attraction far beyond physical beauty and style to reach our goals in today\u2019s hypercompetitive world.\n\nThe most successful business leaders use six key strategies to boost attractiveness. You can harness the same approach to drive meaningful results in your company, career, and community:\n\nLead with passion \u2014 When you are passionate about your ideas and connected to the purpose behind your mission, your attractiveness goes through the roof. In the words of military theorist Ferdinand Foch, \u201cThe most powerful weapon on earth is the human soul on fire.\u201d Amen.\n\nDon\u2019t fake it \u2014 Nowadays, we all have highly developed \u201cBS detectors.\u201d Keep it real. Authenticity trumps fancy talk any day. Trust must be earned and can be shattered in an instant. Stop being apologetic for who you are not, and celebrate who you are.\n\nBe interested instead of interesting \u2014 Dale Carnegie had it right \u2014 you attract others when you are genuinely interested in them. Listen more, talk less. Ask questions and seek to understand. You\u2019ll be amazed how everyone suddenly wants to be your friend.\n\nDon\u2019t waiver \u2014 If you are second-guessing yourself or your ideas, so will others. Confidence is the most attractive attribute in any act of persuasion, personal or business. Stand firm to your beliefs, and in turn, others will gravitate to you.\n\nBe remarkable \u2014 The world doesn\u2019t need another me-too anything. Whether you\u2019re selling your product, yourself, or your vision, make sure they are unique and compelling. Dream your own dreams, not a slight variation of someone else\u2019s.\n\nMake a difference \u2014 If your idea is a scheme to make piles of cash at the expense of the world, you\u2019ll have an easier time pushing boulders up a mountain. If you are solving a real human problem and truly working to make the world a better place, it will show and you will shine.\n\nThe toll booth to your next level of greatness is likely an upcoming act of persuasion. Seize these laws of attraction, and you\u2019ll have more pull than a high-powered magnet. Focus on who you are, and the money, friends, team members, lovers, and supporters will materialize as if they were ordered from Amazon.com. overnight delivery.\n\nJosh Linkner is a successful tech entrepreneur, author and keynote speaker.
