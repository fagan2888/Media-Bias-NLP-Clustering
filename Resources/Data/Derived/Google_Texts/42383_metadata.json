State environmental health officials Stephen Busch and Michael Prysby were charged with \u201cmisconduct, evidence tampering, conspiracy and violations of the Safe Water Drinking Act\u201d for allegedly changing water test results.\n\nIf convicted, the three could face up to five years in prison, the attorney general said at a news conference. And Schuette promised there would be more prosecutions in the case that has enraged many Americans and severely tarnished the reputation of Republican Gov. Rick Snyder\n\nFlint residents and city officials, no doubt, were pleased with what appears to be the first serious step towards determining accountability for a beleaguered city that has gone without potable drinking water for over a year. The predominantly black and impoverished factory town has been beset with a host of public health problems, including an uptick in Legionnaire\u2019s Disease and the horrifying threat of developmental problems for infants and toddlers who were exposed to the lead-laden drinking water.\n\nRelated: How the Flint Drinking Water Crisis Became a Political Punching Bag\n\nFlint became a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre for the two Democratic presidential candidates, Hillary Clinton and Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who staged a presidential debate there in early March. The governor and federal Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Gina McCarthy were recently hauled before a House investigative committee and pummeled by Republicans and Democrats alike for botching the crisis.\n\nMaking matters worse, a national study by a public interest group found that Flint residents paid the highest water rates in America at the same time the water was being poisoned with lead from leaching pipes.\n\nWhile he has rejected repeated calls for his resignation, Snyder, a once promising Republican chief executive, has launched a flurry of legislative and funding initiatives to finance a complete overhaul of Flint\u2019s aging water system. And just this week, he dramatized the fact that the water quality has improved by announcing that he would be drinking filtered Flint tap water at his home and office for the next month.\n\nRelated: Flint\u2019s Drinking Water Crisis Just Got More Toxic with Legionnaire\u2019s Disease\n\nBut grandstanding aside, Flint Mayor Karen Weaver and city residents would be far happier if state and federal officials made good on their promises to help fund a replacement of the city\u2019s water treatment facility and the network of pipes that have leached lead into the water system.\n\nAsked yesterday for her reaction to the charges brought against the three former city and state officials, Weaver said that while establishing accountability was important, \u201cWhat we really need is financial assistance.\u201d\n\nWeaver is championing the city\u2019s \u201cFast Start\u201d program with a commitment of funding from the state to replace lead service lines suspected of having poisoned the city\u2019s water supply, but it\u2019s off to a slow start. The original plan was to complete new connections to 30 homes by the end of last month, but the city missed the deadline.\n\nWeaver has told reporters that the total cost of replacing the system is roughly $55 million. So far, the Michigan state legislature has moved at a glacial pace to act on the majority of Snyder\u2019s $195-million budget package to revitalize Flint, including new funding for water line replacement, according to the Detroit Free Press.\n\nThe funding problem only gets worse higher up the food chain.\n\nRelated: Congress Fumbles Again on Funding for the Flint Water Crisis\n\nIn Washington, a single Republican senator \u2013 Mike Lee of Utah \u2013 managed to hold up a major federal funding package worth more than $100 million which could have been used in part to help Flint address its water crisis. Sens. Debbie Stabenow and Gary Peters, both Michigan Democrats, fought hard to keep the Flint funding included in a much larger energy projects package.\n\nHowever, they recently gave up and allowed the Flint funding to be dropped by the legislation when Lee refused to budge.\n\n\u201cMichigan has an enormous budget surplus this year and a large rainy-day fund,\u201d Lee said in a statement. \u201cRelief and repair efforts are already in the works. The people and policymakers of Michigan right now have all the government resources they need to fix the problem \u2026 The only thing Congress is contributing to the Flint recovery is political grandstanding.\u201d\n\nStabenow did not agree.\n\n\"It's totally unacceptable that Sen. Lee continues to block a vote on our fully paid for, bipartisan agreement to help Flint and other communities across the nation who have serious lead and water problems,\" she said. \"This is about something as basic as making sure families have clean water to drink and children with lead poisoning get the help they need.\"", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The wheels of justice are finally beginning to turn in Flint, Michigan, following last", "title": "Charges for Flint Officials, but What the City Really Needs Is Financial Help", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/04/21/Charges-Flint-Officials-What-City-Really-Needs-Financial-Help", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/flint-water-top.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/04/21/Charges-Flint-Officials-What-City-Really-Needs-Financial-Help", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/flint-water-top.jpg", "title": "The Fiscal Times", "card": "summary", "creator": "@ericpianin"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "The wheels of justice are finally beginning to turn in Flint, Michigan, following last", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "However, they recently gave up and allowed the Flint funding to be dropped by the legislation when Lee refused to budge.\nDebbie Stabenow and Gary Peters, both Michigan Democrats, fought hard to keep the Flint funding included in a much larger energy projects package.\nRick SnyderFlint residents and city officials, no doubt, were pleased with what appears to be the first serious step towards determining accountability for a beleaguered city that has gone without potable drinking water for over a year.\nState environmental health officials Stephen Busch and Michael Prysby were charged with \u201cmisconduct, evidence tampering, conspiracy and violations of the Safe Water Drinking Act\u201d for allegedly changing water test results.\nRelated: How the Flint Drinking Water Crisis Became a Political Punching BagFlint became a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre for the two Democratic presidential candidates, Hillary Clinton and Sen.
