It\u2019s unbelievable.\u201d\n\nProduced by Americans for Limited Government \u2013 which has been leading the fight against this crony capitalist monstrosity \u2013 the sixty-second radio spot will begin airing in early voting South Carolina and New Hampshire beginning Thursday. A national rollout will follow \u2013 directly listeners to the website Obamatrade.com.\n\n\u201cI learned a long time ago a bad deal is far worse than no deal at all,\u201d Trump says in the spot, calling Obamatrade a \u201cbad, bad deal for American businesses, for workers, for taxpayers.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a huge set of handouts for a few insiders who don\u2019t even care about our great America,\u201d he notes.\n\nTrump is 100 percent correct \u2026\n\n\u201cObamatrade\u201d is a two-part deal. The first part is \u201ctrade promotion authority\u201d (TPA) \u2013 or \u201cFast Track\u201d \u2013 which refers to the ability of Obama to unilaterally write and enforce the second part, which is the \u201cTrans-Pacific Parternship\u201d (TPP) \u2013 a massive trade deal with Pacific Rim nations.\n\nThe former is basically a blank check to the Obama administration to impose the latter \u2013 a special interest, crony capitalist bonanza that would benefit liberal Hollywood elites and wealthy bailout recipients on Wall Street at the expense of U.S. workers.\n\nTrump called on members of Congress to \u201cstand up and defeat this raw power grab.\u201d\n\n\u201cWith the dismal Obama track record why should a Republican Congress give him more power \u2013 and gut the Constitution to do it,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIt\u2019s crazy.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is a game changer in the debate over fast track trade authority,\u201d said Rick Manning, president of ALG. \u201cMr. Trump\u2019s business acumen and expertise makes him a unique and powerful voice whom America trusts to tell them the truth.\u201d\n\nWanna hear the ad for yourself? CLICK HERE.\n\nAs we\u2019ve repeatedly noted, Obamatrade would be bad for America (see HERE and HERE). And especially bad for South Carolina (HERE and HERE). Which is why we have called on our state\u2019s \u201cconservative\u201d congressional delegation to oppose it \u2013 joining those responsible members of the U.S. Congress who have already taken a stand.\n\nWe\u2019re glad to see yet another presidential candidate sound the alarm on this important issue \u2026", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.fitsnews.com/2015/05/07/the-donald-rebukes-obamatrade/", "site_name": "http://www.fitsnews.com", "image": "http://fitsnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/donald-trump-493x370.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "\u201cThe Donald\u201d Rebukes Obamatrade"}, "google-site-verification": "qt01SY7jA5pURQJ_8ITASviDysHU8yHfJWpIIdAPKQU", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1,user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca17e\"", "article_summary": "\u201cSome in the Republican Party are working overtime to hand more power to President Obama,\u201d Trump says in a new radio ad.\n\u201cIt\u2019s crazy.\u201d\u201cThis is a game changer in the debate over fast track trade authority,\u201d said Rick Manning, president of ALG.\nAs we\u2019ve repeatedly noted, Obamatrade would be bad for America (see HERE and HERE).\nTrump is 100 percent correct \u2026\u201cObamatrade\u201d is a two-part deal.\n\u201cI learned a long time ago a bad deal is far worse than no deal at all,\u201d Trump says in the spot, calling Obamatrade a \u201cbad, bad deal for American businesses, for workers, for taxpayers.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a huge set of handouts for a few insiders who don\u2019t even care about our great America,\u201d he notes."}
