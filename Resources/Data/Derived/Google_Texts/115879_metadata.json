The study, completed by researchers at Aoyama Gakuin University\u2019s Psychology department, sought to investigate music\u2019s impact on getting-to-know-you scenes, and whether it made you more likely to fall in love.\n\n\u201cThis study examines whether background music gives young Japanese adults a more favorable impression of conversation partners of the opposite sex for the first meeting,\u201d the authors wrote in their abstract. They ultimately found that simply having conservations with people of the opposite sex works to boost someone\u2019s opinion of them; but having background music enhanced their sense of intimacy and attraction.\n\nThe researchers gathered 32 girls and guys, all of whom were in their teens or 20s, to meet up for konkatsu \u2014 a Japanese practice known as marriage hunting, similar to speed-dating. The participants were given one of two conditions: The first experienced background music during a 20-minute conversation, and the other was the \u201cno-music\u201d group in which no music was present. They were divided into eight groups of two males and two females each, and four other students in two male and female pairs were \u201cguests\u201d in the conversation.\n\nThe participants were asked to rate their impressions of the guests of the opposite sex both before and after the conversation. People in the music rooms chatted informally with their partners as either rock, rap, or classical music played in the background.\n\nIn both groups, participants were asked to rate scores for 10 traits in their partners, such as confidence, patients, likeableness, as well as their own personal interest in dating them before and after their conversations. While people\u2019s impressions of their partners rose simply through face-to-face conversation, levels of intimacy and attraction increased even more with music playing in the background.\n\nThe study did not, however, look into what types of music had certain effects on lovers and acquaintances; rather, it was merely a glimpse into how music as a whole affects us compared to no music. One study completed in 2010 suggested that songs with romantic lyrics could impact a woman\u2019s compliance with a romantic request \u2014 like spurring her to agree to give someone her phone number. But if your least favorite band is playing in the background, will you still have as much of a favorable impression of your conversation partner, or be as likely to take a leap of faith and be open to someone approaching you at a bar? These are interesting questions that have yet to be investigated.\n\nSource: Shigeno S. Effects of background music on young Japanese adults\u2019 impressions of opposite-sex conversation partners.
