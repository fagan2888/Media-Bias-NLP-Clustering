Traffic on I-35 began Friday morning when two 18-wheelers were unable to get enough momentum to get up a hill. They left both lanes blocked.\n\nOne right lane was open Saturday morning, but the backup remains as drivers try to unwind. And other 18-wheelers are getting stuck in the same spot as they try to get through. TxDOT crews are on the scene, trying to de-ice the road and helping each 18-wheeler that gets stuck find traction so the traffic can continue to unwind.\n\n\u201cWe had to sit up there and keep doing this over and over,\u201d Michelle Releford, a TxDOT spokeswoman.\n\nReleford said the agency is currently sending more workers to the site to try and keep things moving. She said the six inches of ice on the road has made it hard to give trucks traction and keep clear since the temperature remains below freezing.\n\n\u201cIn some cases we have to shovel aggregate-type salt and sand for traction underneath the wheels for the big rigs,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have to go to real extremes.\u201d\n\nWith temperatures not reaching past the mid-20s today, treacherous streets and dangerous highway overpasses are still an issue throughout North Texas. Much of the slush from the winter storm has refrozen, making roads that weren\u2019t already iced over slick.\n\n\u201cDuring this time and with any major weather event, I\u2019d advise that if you don\u2019t have to go out don\u2019t travel,\u201d said meteorologist Joe Harris.", "article_metadata": {"liveFyreID": "aHR0cDovL3RoZXNjb29wYmxvZy5kYWxsYXNuZXdzLmNvbS8yMDEzLzEyL2ljZS1hbmQtdHJhZmZpYy1uaWdodG1hcmUtcmVtYWluLW9uLWktMzUtaW4tc2FuZ2VyLmh0bWwv", "generator": "WordPress 3.9.12", "author": "Brandon Formby", "og": {"site_name": "The Scoop Blog", "description": "The Texas Department of Transportation is attempting to aid in the miles-long backup on northbound Interstate 35E in Denton County, but with frigid temperatures and traffic going nowhere, sand and\u2026", "title": "Ice and traffic nightmare plague I-35 in Sanger as North Texas roads remain dangerous", "url": "http://thescoopblog.dallasnews.com/2013/12/ice-and-traffic-nightmare-remain-on-i-35-in-sanger.html/", "image": "http://thescoopblog.dallasnews.com/wp-content/themes/dallasnews/images/facebook-default-black.jpg", "type": "article"}, "LastModifiedDate": "2013-12-07T14:30:42Z", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image"}, "PublishDate": "2012-04-11T13:59:21Z", "wp-parsely_version": "1.7", "viewport": "width=device-width", "google-site-verification": "ZjZz-aaVcLkLDp8kIkLnEwtSTZlAwGgQhLyd1pXAbA8", "cXenseParse": {"recs": {"publishtime": "2012-04-11T13:59:21Z"}}}, "article_summary": "Traffic on I-35 began Friday morning when two 18-wheelers were unable to get enough momentum to get up a hill.\nDrivers are slowly crawling through the traffic nightmare that\u2019s now lasted for about 24 hours.\n\u201cIn some cases we have to shovel aggregate-type salt and sand for traction underneath the wheels for the big rigs,\u201d she said.\nMuch of the slush from the winter storm has refrozen, making roads that weren\u2019t already iced over slick.\n\u201cWe have to go to real extremes.\u201dWith temperatures not reaching past the mid-20s today, treacherous streets and dangerous highway overpasses are still an issue throughout North Texas."}
