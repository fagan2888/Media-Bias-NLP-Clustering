Rand Paul (R-KY) was asked about the Indiana religious freedom law.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\n\u201cWe have had religious liberty from the very beginning [of this country], Paul explained, which and he suggested the power of persuasion instead of \u201chitting people over the head with a law or lawsuits.\u201d\n\nOn the topic of so-called discrimination from Christian businesses, Paul said, \u201cI\u2019m very much a believer in tolerance. I\u2019m very much a believer in respect. And I\u2019m very much a believer that government shouldn\u2019t be involved in these things. And I think what people set up was a red herring here to go to a pizza place and ask if they will cater a wedding. I haven\u2019t been to a wedding catered by a pizza place yet. So basically it was set up as a straw argument. Even the owners of the pizza place said they don\u2019t discriminate when people come in. And so I think we really trump up theses things.\u201d\n\n\u201cI ultimately think if you are a Christian and you want to go to Africa and evangelize, the best way to convince people over is through persuasion,\u201d he continued. \u201cAnd I think the same way no matter what opinion you are trying to promote, that persuasion wins a lot more people over than hitting people over the head with a law or lawsuits and things like that. So I think society does change gradually over time and society has changed a lot even in the last decade or so. I don\u2019t think we need government or lawsuits to be involved.\u201d\n\nFollow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN", "article_metadata": {"description": "Rand to Christians: Evangelize, Don't 'Hit People Over the Head' With Laws", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Rand to Christians: Evangelize, Don't 'Hit People Over the Head' With Laws", "title": "Rand on RFRA: Persuade, Don't 'Hit People Over the Head' with Laws, Lawsuit - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/04/randpaul.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/video/2015/04/09/rand-on-rfra-persuade-dont-hit-people-over-the-head-with-laws-lawsuit/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Rand to Christians: Evangelize, Don't 'Hit People Over the Head' With Laws", "creator": "@pamkeyNEN", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/04/randpaul.jpg", "title": "Rand on RFRA: Persuade, Don't 'Hit People Over the Head' with Laws, Lawsuit - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "app_id": 1243316582352556, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Rand Paul,2016 Presidential Race, Breitbart TV, Faith,Rand Paul", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "2016 Presidential Race", "tag": "Rand Paul", "published_time": "2015-04-09T08:53:48-07:00", "categories": "Breitbart TV,2016 Presidential Race,Faith"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3b24\"", "article_summary": "Even the owners of the pizza place said they don\u2019t discriminate when people come in.\nI haven\u2019t been to a wedding catered by a pizza place yet.\nAnd I think what people set up was a red herring here to go to a pizza place and ask if they will cater a wedding.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERWednesday on Boston Herald Radio\u2019s \u201cMorning Meeting,\u201d Sen.
