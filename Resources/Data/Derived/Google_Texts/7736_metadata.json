All of it allows an insider's perspective of how things take shape throughout a season.\n\nAll of that also makes it interesting to see how others view the team, which obviously comes with a much different perspective from seeing the team in snippets, either from the few times Tampa Bay plays other teams, watching a few games on television or checking out the standings.\n\nSeeing how others view this year's version of the Lightning one might think would raise some eyebrows and the team would have gained respect for what it has accomplished, particularly for playing most of the season without prominent goal-scorer Steven Stamkos.\n\nBut after clicking on a link Thursday afternoon while in Calgary, the day after Tampa Bay knocked off Vancouver, the description of the Lightning was ... strange.\n\nAfter the Lightning knocked off the Canucks 4-2, the Vancouver Province used this line in describing the game: \u201cFor the Canucks, it was an embarrassingly listless 4-2 loss to the Tampa Bay Lightning. They were fed a cupcake, and most Eastern teams qualify, and choked trying to get it down.\u201d\n\nA cupcake? The No. 3 team in the Eastern Conference, a team with more victories than the Canucks, is considered a cupcake?\n\nTalk about earning no respect.\n\nMaybe it's just the fact that the Canucks are supposed to be a powerhouse in the NHL and the Lightning are still just that team that plays in Florida. Perhaps it's because Tampa Bay finished 28th in the league last year, and perception of last year's team acts as reality.\n\nOr maybe, as referenced in the above line, that the West has dominated East vs. West matchups this season allowed the author to ignore Tampa Bay's 8-3-2 record against the West heading into Thursday that included victories against St. Louis, Chicago, Anaheim and Los Angeles.\n\nBut maybe in reality, the Lightning were just the better team that night, or in general.\n\nThis wasn't the 1993 version of the Lightning that came in and stole a game from the Canucks. It was just a dominating performance by a Tampa Bay team that has been at the top of the East standings since the beginning of the season, and has stayed there.\n\nSure, this team won't dazzle you, and it doesn't have a high-octane offense full of electrifying players \u2014 especially without Stamkos \u2014 with a \u201cwow\u201d factor.\n\nThe players don't often show up on the highlight reels. And for the most part, there are not any household names on this team.\n\nAll the Lightning do is win games.\n\nBut most certainly, they are not \u201ccupcakes.\u201d\n\neerlendsson@tampatrib.com\n\n(813) 259-7835\n\nTwitter: @erlendssonTBO", "article_metadata": {"taboola-pub-time": "Sat, 04 Jan 2014 22:46:17 -0400", "Description": "Even the best start in team history isn't enough to convince some across the NHL that the Lightning are for real.", "og": {"site_name": "TBO.com", "description": "Even the best start in team history isn't enough to convince some across the NHL that the Lightning are for real.", "title": "Bolts Beat: Leaguewide respect still elusive", "url": "http://www.tbo.com/sports/lightning/bolts-beat-league-wide-respect-still-elusive-20140104/", "image": {"width": 3500, "identifier": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20140104/ARTICLE/140109674/AR/0/AR-140109674.jpg", "height": 2030}, "updated_time": "2014-01-04T23:28:00Z-04", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "tbo.com", "description": "Even the best start in team history isn't enough to convince some across the NHL that the Lightning are for real.", "title": "Bolts Beat: Leaguewide respect still elusive", "image": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20140104/ARTICLE/140109674/AR/0/AR-140109674.jpg", "site": "@TBOcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 522234267826834}, "msvalidate.01": "29E67031F86E7FB6DF9823924E21B8B4", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/tbocom", "published_time": "2014-01-04T22:46:17Z-04", "modified_time": "2014-01-04T23:28:00Z-04"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8238\"", "article_summary": "Perhaps it's because Tampa Bay finished 28th in the league last year, and perception of last year's team acts as reality.\nBut after clicking on a link Thursday afternoon while in Calgary, the day after Tampa Bay knocked off Vancouver, the description of the Lightning was ... strange.\nEDMONTON, Alberta \u2014 Following the Tampa Bay Lightning around almost from the start of training camp until the end of the season \u2014 whenever that happens to be \u2014 offers a unique and up-close perspective.\nAfter the Lightning knocked off the Canucks 4-2, the Vancouver Province used this line in describing the game: \u201cFor the Canucks, it was an embarrassingly listless 4-2 loss to the Tampa Bay Lightning.\nIt was just a dominating performance by a Tampa Bay team that has been at the top of the East standings since the beginning of the season, and has stayed there."}
