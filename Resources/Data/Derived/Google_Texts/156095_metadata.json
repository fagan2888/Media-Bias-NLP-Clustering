Lindsey Graham appeared to be the most willing to take RNC Chairman Reince Priebus' advice to attack Democrat Hillary Clinton rather than his fellow Republican presidential candidates.At Thursday's Fox News debate for the bottom seven ranked candidates, Graham twice went off on the Democratic front-runner when asked seemingly nonreleated question.Graham was the first of the seven to mention Clinton's name when he was asked by one of the moderators, how conservative Republican voters can trust him since he has worked with President Barack Obama on climate change.\"You can trust me to do the following: That when I get on the stage with Hillary Clinton, we won't be debating about the science, but about the solutions,\" Graham said.When he was asked later how he would move Americans toward looking for work rather than accepting government assistance, Graham said, \"I think America's dying to work. You just need to give them a chance. To all the Americans who want a better life, don't vote for Hillary Clinton. You're not going to get it. She's not going to repeal Obamacare and replace it. I will. She's not going to build the Keystone pipeline. I will. \u2026 She represents a third term of a failed presidency.\"He brought up former President Bill Clinton's testimony during the Monica Lewinsky scandal as well as current questions about Hillary Clinton's private email server.\"So the people who are dying for a better America, you'd better change course. And she doesn't represent the change that we need,\" Graham said.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Lindsey Graham, GOP Debate", "pubdate": "2015-08-06T18:23:12", "og": {"site_name": "Newsmax", "description": "South Carolina Sen.
