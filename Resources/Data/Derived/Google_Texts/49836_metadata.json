I want to hear from our customers how we\u2019re doing. I want to talk to our provider partners and get their feedback and input, as well as employers and individuals, and really hear from them,\u201d she said. \u201cI want to know what they value, what they think is going well and what they don\u2019t think is going so sell. I want to have a dialogue with them about where is health care headed, the myths and the truths about the ACA, how it\u2019s helping them or giving them challenges, and what we can do to make their lives better.\u201d\n\nBudden joined Priority Health six years ago as chief marketing officer. She has more than 25 years of experience in the health insurance industry, having previously worked at Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan in various leadership and executive positions.\n\nShe succeeds retiring President and CEO Mike Freed as Priority Health navigates what she calls \u201cexciting times in health care\u201d brought on by the Affordable Care Act and an evolving economic model that emphasizes quality and outcomes over volume for providers. Priority Health at the same time is \u201cin the best shape we\u2019ve ever been in as an organization,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of changes that we\u2019ve been going through and will probably continue to happen,\u201d Budden said. \u201cI just think that there are some dynamics going on in the marketplace where there are some real opportunities for change and disruption and we\u2019re well-positioned to take advantage of it.\u201d\n\nAs chief marketing officer at Priority Health, Budden led marketing for individual, group commercial and Medicare and Medicaid plans. She also spearheaded Priority Health\u2019s implementation of programs related to the federal Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. That process led the state to name Priority Health as the benchmark health plan for coverage sold on the public health exchange in Michigan.\n\nIn seeking a successor to Freed, parent health system Spectrum Health considered only internal candidates, which follows a corporate strategy of developing executive leadership from within, President and CEO Rick Breon told MiBiz.\n\nBreon cited Budden\u2019s background and \u201cpretty deep experience\u201d in marketing, product development and strategic planning and her ability to see the \u201ccomplex issues\u201d that health care faces today, Breon said. Her depth of experience \u201cstood out more than anything else,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s done a lot of things that are important to the sustainability and growth of the health plan,\u201d Breon said.\n\nPriority Health has more than 650,000 members statewide enrolled in various health plans. The HMO is the largest, with about 407,000 members as of Oct. 31, according to a quarterly report filed with state regulators. Budden expects membership to approach 700,000 early in 2016.\n\nThrough the third quarter, Priority Health\u2019s HMO business had revenues of $1.62 billion with net income of $53.9 million, versus revenues of $1.48 billion and net income of $72.5 million through the first nine months of 2014, according to the financial report.", "article_metadata": {"description": "GRAND RAPIDS \u2014 As she transitions next month to chief executive of one of the state\u2019s largest health insurers, Joan Budden wants to reach...", "generator": "runengine.com", "rights": "www.MiBiz.com", "og": {"url": "https://mibiz.com/item/23136-new-priority-health-ceo-seeks-dialogue-with-clients,-care-providers", "image": "http://mibiz.com/media/k2/items/cache/49de283ea1b018319335e01f4479ee85_XL.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "GRAND RAPIDS \u2014 As she transitions next month to chief executive of one of the state\u2019s largest health insurers, Joan Budden wants to reach...", "title": "New Priority Health CEO seeks dialogue with clients, care providers"}, "image": "https://mibiz.com/media/k2/items/cache/49de283ea1b018319335e01f4479ee85_S.jpg", "title": "New Priority Health CEO seeks dialogue with clients, care providers", "author": "Mark Sanchez", "keywords": "Joan Budden,Priority Health,Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan,Mike Freed,Rick Breon", "original-source": "https://mibiz.com/item/23136-new-priority-health-ceo-seeks-dialogue-with-clients,-care-providers"}, "article_summary": "That process led the state to name Priority Health as the benchmark health plan for coverage sold on the public health exchange in Michigan.\nPriority Health has more than 650,000 members statewide enrolled in various health plans.\nPriority Health at the same time is \u201cin the best shape we\u2019ve ever been in as an organization,\u201d she said.\nShe succeeds retiring President and CEO Mike Freed as Priority Health navigates what she calls \u201cexciting times in health care\u201d brought on by the Affordable Care Act and an evolving economic model that emphasizes quality and outcomes over volume for providers.\nAddressing the high cost of health coverage, the trend toward wellness and managing employee health, and navigating the push for price transparency remain top of mind for all health plans in today\u2019s marketplace."}
