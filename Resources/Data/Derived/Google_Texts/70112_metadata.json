Federal Election Commission, lifting restrictions on political speech and allowing unlimited contributions to super PACs.\n\nIn September, NEA president Lily Eskelsen Garcia accused the U.S. Senate of bowing \u201cto corporate manipulators like the Koch brothers, the Walton family and ALEC\u201d by voting against an amendment to the Constitution limiting political spending.\n\nAccording to Eskelsen Garcia, the Kochs and others \u201cuse the Citizens United decision to stifle the voices of America\u2019s workers and voters by making sure their fiscal interests and voice come before the interests of working families. The power to speak freely is a hollow freedom for the millions of Americans whose voice is drowned out by the booming echo of big money posing as free speech.\u201d\n\nNEA took $362.9 million in dues and fees from teachers in 2014; Eskelsen Garcia was paid $345,728 as NEA vice president, and outgoing president Dennis Van Roekel got $541,632. Based on a Center for Responsive Politics review of FEC data, NEA poured more than $16 million into NEA Advocacy Fund during the latest election cycle.\n\nNEA did not respond to a request for comment on spending disclosed in the union\u2019s 2014 report to the U.S. Department of Labor.\n\nLike smaller teachers union American Federation of Teachers, NEA \u2014 which took mandatory \u201cagency fees\u201d from 90,255 nonmembers this year \u2014 promotes left-wing causes not only through PAC and super PAC contributions but also through donations and payments to expressly political businesses and nonprofits.\n\nFor 2014, NEA reported $31.4 million in \u201cPolitical Activities and Lobbying.\u201c Another $3.6 million in payments to political organizations were reported as \u201cContributions, Gifts and Grants.\u201d\n\nMuch of NEA\u2019s political spending went to key funding targets of Democracy Alliance, a secretive group of wealthy leftists whose board is chaired by NEA executive director John Stocks. NEA gave $160,000 to Democracy Alliance and $25,000 to the group\u2019s Committee on States project, reporting neither as political activity.\n\nNEA payments of a combined $534,500 to America Votes and America Votes Action Fund, $393,541 to data consulting firm Catalist, $150,000 to Ballot Initiative Strategy Center and $50,000 to New Organizing Institute were all reported as political activity.\n\nBut payments of $250,000 to Latino Engagement Action Fund, $160,000 to Center for American Progress, $150,000 to ProgressNow, $150,000 to Youth Engagement Fund, $25,000 to Center on Budget and Policy Priorities and $10,000 to American Constitution Society were not.\n\nAll of the above organizations were members of the Democracy Alliance \u201cAligned Network,\u201d a designation reserved for the group\u2019s top funding priorities, as of spring 2014, based on internal documents obtained by The Washington Free Beacon.\n\nAside from payments to NEA Advocacy Fund and the Democracy Alliance network, notable NEA expenditures reported as political activity included $2 million to union advocacy group Colorado Commits to Kids, $500,000 to Missouri-based Committee in Support of Public Education, $483,000 to Seattle-based Class Size Counts and $150,000 to American Bridge 21st Century, another \u201cprogressive\u201d super PAC.\n\nOther NEA political expenditures not reported as political activity included $235,000 to Progressive States Network, $225,000 to Center for Popular Democracy Action Fund, $160,000 to National Public Pension Coalition and $75,000 to Human Rights Campaign.\n\nNEA donated $250,000 to Main Street Advocacy Fund, a \u201cconservative\u201d group created to attack conservatives on behalf of big-government Republicans, and $25,000 to sister organization Republican Main Street Partnership.\n\nIn a phone interview, Association of American Educators communications director Alexandra Freeze told Watchdog.org AAE often hears from teachers shocked to learn how NEA spends their money.\n\n\u201cI think a lot of teachers really have absolutely no idea how much these union executives are making,\u201d Freeze said. \u201cIf teachers really knew the overhead involved in what they\u2019re paying in union dues, I think they would be outraged.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important for teachers to understand that they\u2019re often told their money is staying local, that their money is only going to their benefits and services when in fact it\u2019s actually going to a lot of politically charged organizations.\u201d\n\n\u201cA lot of teachers don\u2019t realize they\u2019re directly funding causes through their membership dues at the NEA, so I think there\u2019s a definite need for more transparency within the organization; teachers need to have that information,\u201d she added.\n\n\u201cAnd the teachers who do find that out are very much disenfranchised by that, and the reason why you\u2019re seeing such a mass exodus of members is because teachers are not interested in being political pawns, and that\u2019s why AAE has grown so much in the last five years, because teachers are looking for an organization that strictly spends their money on benefits and services.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "National Education Association spent over $27 million on politics this year, including $3.6 million not disclosed as political activity.", "og": {"site_name": "Watchdog.org", "description": "National Education Association spent over $27 million on politics this year, including $3.6 million not disclosed as political activity.", "title": "National Education Association spends $35 million on politics - Watchdog.org", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2014/11/nea-logo-300px.gif", "updated_time": "2014-11-26T10:07:33+00:00", "url": "http://watchdog.org/184881/nea-political-spending/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Watchdog.org", "description": "National Education Association spent over $27 million on politics this year, including $3.6 million not disclosed as political activity.", "creator": "@jasonahart", "image": {"src": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2014/11/nea-logo-300px.gif"}, "title": "National Education Association spends $35 million on politics - Watchdog.org", "site": "@watchdogorg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noarchive", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Watchdogorg", "section": "Labor", "published_time": "2014-12-01T04:00:47+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-11-26T10:07:33+00:00"}, "news_keywords": "NEA, Democracy Alliance, Lily Eskelsen Garcia, John Stocks, Center for American Progress, Main Street Advocacy, ProgressNow, Citizens United, Super PAC"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3a68\"", "article_summary": "By Jason Hart | Watchdog.orgThe National Education Association spent more than $35 million on politics this year, including $3.6 million not disclosed as political activity.\nBased on a Center for Responsive Politics review of FEC data, NEA poured more than $16 million into NEA Advocacy Fund during the latest election cycle.\n\u201cI think a lot of teachers really have absolutely no idea how much these union executives are making,\u201d Freeze said.\nDuring NEA\u2019s 2014 fiscal year ending Aug. 31, the union dumped $9.8 million into its NEA Advocacy Fund political action committee, a \u201csuper PAC\u201d the union used to make independent expenditures in congressional races.\nIn a phone interview, Association of American Educators communications director Alexandra Freeze told Watchdog.org AAE often hears from teachers shocked to learn how NEA spends their money."}
