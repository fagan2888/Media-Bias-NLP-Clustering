Just imagine getting advice about a new recipe in seconds from a professional chef, or receiving a video consultation from a makeup artist.\n\nBut Google has an even bigger vision for Helpouts: to bring affordable health care to patients.\n\nThis may seem like a bit of a stretch, but the search giant has been tentatively moving into health care for years. A few recent examples include the ill-fated Google Health product, and its support for developers building medical applications for Google Glass.\n\nIn fact, it appears that the Helpouts team built the technology with the health industry in mind. The video service is fully HIPAA-compliant, meaning that clinical care providers can use Helpouts and feel confident that sensitive patient information will not be compromised. It isn\u2019t a cheap or quick proposition to overcome regulatory hurdles \u2014 Google would not have dedicated the legal resources unless it intended to focus on serving patients.\n\nAnd Google has already cherry-picked a handful of health providers who are willing to test out the service with patients. Most of these early users are individual care providers: You can sign up for a counseling session for $2 a minute, or a weight loss consultation with a nutritionist.\n\nHowever, Google is promoting one service in particular, which may be its most ambitious partnership yet.\n\nOne Medical: A perfect test bed\n\n\u201cWe are learning with Google \u2014 [and] it\u2019s been so far, so good,\u201d said Tom Lee, MD, chief executive of the One Medical Group.\n\nOne Medical, which is featured at the top of the health category in Google Helpouts, is a network of dozens of clinics, and hundreds of doctors. One Medical patients can request a Helpout, and typically speak with a physician within 20 minutes. It\u2019s recommended for people with cold and flu symptoms, rashes, or simple infections.\n\nFull disclosure: I have been a patient of One Medical since 2011.\n\nDr. Lee was among the first health entrepreneurs to hear from Google. The Helpouts team asked him to trial the service with patients and report back. The goal is to offer patients the option to video chat with their doctor for a fee of $0 \u2013 60 per session. It\u2019s still early days, so the exact pricing for a video consultation is under discussion.\n\nOne Medical Group is an obvious choice for Google, as it already offers patients the opportunity to chat with a doctor on the phone or instant message \u2014 Dr. Lee calls it \u201ctelemedicine without the picture.\u201d The firm also received investment from Google Ventures, Google\u2019s early-stage investment arm.\n\nThe Google Helpouts pilot program is already looking promising.\n\nDr. Lee expects that a portion of One Medical patients (most likely, the young, professional, urban dwellers) won\u2019t need to make a physical visit to the doctor\u2019s office for a consultation in the future.\n\nRiding the telehealth trend\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time that patients have been able to converse with a doctor online.\n\nTelemedicine or \u201ctelehealth\u201d vendors have been selling their secure video technology to care providers for years. Giants like Cisco and IBM have research and development teams dedicated to the emerging trend. We\u2019ve also seen the emergence of startups like Breakthrough and Regroup Therapy, which specialize in connecting people with therapists and psychiatrists for video sessions.\n\nBut whenever Google gets involved, any niche or emerging technology is guaranteed a huge audience. The notion that you can video chat with a doctor or therapist may soon become the norm \u2014 not a bonus feature.\n\nThese video services aren\u2019t intended to replace physical visits entirely. But they are an option for patients living in remote areas, or people who have a niggling or urgent question. We\u2019ve all experienced situations where a physical doctor\u2019s visit isn\u2019t really necessary.\n\nTelehealth and the policy horizon\n\nThe timing for Google Helpouts is unlikely to be a happy accident. With the rollout of the Affordable Care Act, telemedicine is a huge concern for policymakers in our nation\u2019s capital.\n\n\u201cI see health delivery relying on many different methods for individuals to consume care,\u201d said Lauren Fifield, a senior policy strategist at Practice Fusion, who divides her time between San Francisco and D.C.\n\n\u201cTelemedicine is a hot topic on the Hill and is supported by both sides of the aisle,\u201d she said, meaning both Democrats and Republicans have latched onto telemedicine as a means to drive down costs. In the month of July alone, bills were introduced in New Jersey, Washington D.C., Kentucky, and Missouri to expand telehealth coverage for patients.\n\n\u201cThis is a big year on the policy horizon for reimbursement of telehealth services,\u201d Fifield added.\n\nThat said, telemedicine certainly has its skeptics, who may be a vocal minority. Many doctors don\u2019t believe patients would feel comfortable sharing sensitive details on a video platform. Also, one might argue that it\u2019s far too easy to miss a symptom on a video call \u2014 it\u2019s easier to detect a subtle tremor or blemish in person.\n\nHowever, remote video monitoring tools and devices have already proven invaluable for doctors, who use them to keep abreast of the daily condition of their most chronically ill patients or of women with high-risk pregnancies. The University of Virginia Center for Telehealth recently reported that it reduced preterm deliveries during high-risk pregnancies by 25 percent using telemedical services.\n\nFor Dr. Lee, telehealth is one potential means to lower the cost of health care. \u201cHelpouts will allow our patients to get high quality affordable care,\u201d he said. \u201cThe system is so wasteful.\u201d\n\nRelated articles\n\nFacebook Get more stories like this on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"bt": {"pubDate": "2013-11-20T09:00:46+00:00", "author": "christina-farr", "modDate": "2013-11-20T09:00:46+00:00", "keywords": "concierge,editors-pick,google,health-2,health-care,helpouts,information-technology,telehealth,telemedicine,top-stories,video-technology,wellness", "type": "news", "id": 862479}, "og": {"site_name": "VentureBeat", "description": "Google has an even bigger vision for Helpouts, its face-to-face video consultation platform: To bring affordable health care to patients.", "title": "Google\u2019s big health care play: Helpouts is all about video consultations with your\u00a0doctor", "url": "http://venturebeat.com/2013/11/20/googles-big-health-care-play-helpouts-is-all-about-video-consultations-with-your-doctor/", "image": "http://1u88jj3r4db2x4txp44yqfj1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/one_medical_helpouts_example-780x475.jpg", "type": "article"}, "description": "Google has an even bigger vision for Helpouts, its face-to-face video consultation platform: To bring affordable health care to\u00a0patients.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "This may seem like a bit of a stretch, but the search giant has been tentatively moving into health care for years.\nFor Dr. Lee, telehealth is one potential means to lower the cost of health care.\nThis month, Google announced Helpouts, a video service that puts you face-to-face with an expert anywhere in the world.\nA few recent examples include the ill-fated Google Health product, and its support for developers building medical applications for Google Glass.\nBut Google has an even bigger vision for Helpouts: to bring affordable health care to patients."}
