In January, the Ohio village of Sebring closed schools for several days due to lead in pipes.\n\nDetroit began collecting water samples at 62 elementary and elementary-middle schools the week of March 28.\n\nResults from the remaining 20 or so buildings, which include middle and high schools, are expected one to two weeks after testing is finished this month, the district said.\n\nThe district said the levels of lead and copper found in water samples taken from student drinking fountains and kitchen food-preparation sinks inside 19 schools rose above safety thresholds established by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.\n\nThe levels varied. At Ludington Magnet Middle School, for example, a sink had lead levels of 67 parts per billion, above the 15 parts per billion threshold set by the EPA.\n\nEach school, however, had elevated lead in one of the three fixtures tested, which Zdrodowski said suggests the toxins not part of a broader problem. Fixes could include replacing fixtures or flushing pipes daily.\n\nThe district said it has shut off the drinking fountains in the affected schools and is bringing in more bottled water for students and staff, and posted warnings to avoid drinking the water from bathroom sinks, though students are free to wash to their hands.\n\n(Reporting by Ben Klayman and Eric M.
