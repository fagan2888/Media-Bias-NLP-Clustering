The third case involves a Hillsborough County resident who traveled to Venezuela in December.\n\nHealth officials say the virus is quickly spreading through South America, Central America and the Caribbean. It may cause a fever, rash, joint pain, conjunctivitis and could be dangerous for pregnant women or women of childbearing age.\n\nWhile no cases have been contracted in Florida, health officials are warning everyone to be cautious of the disease.\n\nThe Florida Department of Health is telling pregnant women to be extra cautious, as the Zika virus has been linked to birth defects.\n\nOrange County health department director Kevin Sherin said while pregnant women should avoid traveling to these places, all travelers should use mosquito repellant and watch for symptoms.\n\n\u201cZika virus is a relatively mild clinical illness that has conjunctivitis, which is red eyes, a rash, joint pain and a fever. It can last up to a week, often times only a couple of days. Some people don\u2019t experience any symptoms at all,\u201d Sherin said.\n\nThe virus can\u2019t be transmitted from person to person.\n\nSherin said it\u2019s possible local mosquitoes could pick up the virus if they bite an infected person.\n\n-----\n\nCrystal Chavez is a reporter with WMFE in Orlando.
