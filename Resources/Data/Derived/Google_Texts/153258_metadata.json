But it has done a remarkably bad job of explaining the benefits of trade to its rank and file, as exit polls of primary voters depressingly show.\n\nHere\u2019s what the GOP\u2019s 2012 party platform had to say about free trade: \u201cIt means more American jobs, higher wages, and a better standard of living. Every $1 billion in additional U.S. exports means another 5,000 jobs here at home. The Free Trade Agreements negotiated with friendly democracies since President Reagan\u2019s trailblazing pact with Israel in 1985 facilitated the creation of nearly ten million jobs supported by our exports.\u201d\n\nThe platform went on to say that the Obama administration\u2019s \u201cslowness in completing agreements begun by its predecessor and its failure to pursue any new trade agreements with friendly nations\u201d was \u201cdeplorable\u201d and promises that a Republican president \u201cwill complete negotiations for a Trans-Pacific Partnership.\u201d\n\nYou\u2019d be hard pressed to find many in the Republican base who would agree with that statement today. In fact, exit polls of several primary states show that Republicans are more hostile to free trade than Democrats.\n\nIn North Carolina, just 30% of Republican voters say that trade with other countries \u201ccreates U.S. jobs\u201d while 58% say it \u201ctakes away U.S. jobs.\u201d The spread was similar in Mississippi, Illinois and Ohio.\n\nBut what\u2019s really surprising is that, in each of those four states, Democrats were less likely to say trade takes away jobs than Republicans. (See the nearby chart.)\n\nThe exit polls aren\u2019t the first to show this trend.\n\nThe Gallup Poll has for years asked whether trade is mainly an opportunity for the U.S. Up until 2012, Republicans were consistently more supportive of that idea than Democrats. In their last poll, however, 63% of Democrats and Independents said trade is mainly an opportunity (up from the low 30s a decade ago). But just 50% of Republicans feel this way, which is down from a high of 57% in 2002.\n\nYou could blame this as a sign of reflexive GOP hostility to Obama, who recently was pushing TPP. But Obama was silent on trade for most of his presidency. And while Donald Trump is getting the benefit of \u2014 and adding fuel to \u2014 this anti-trade fever, he didn\u2019t cause it, either. A YouGov poll taken in early June 2015 found that just 40% of Republicans said free trade has been good for the U.S., compared with 51% of Democrats.\n\nMore curious still is the fact that Democratic Party leaders have consistently attacked free trade deals, mainly because unions saw them as a threat.\n\nWhat\u2019s most depressing is the fact that the benefits of free trade are one of the few things that just about every economist \u2014 liberal and conservative \u2014 agrees on. As economist Alan Blinder put it, \u201cfor more than two centuries, economists have steadfastly promoted free trade among nations as the best trade policy.\u201d A recent paper by the American Action Forum concluded, for example, that Trump\u2019s protectionist trade agenda could cost consumers $250 billion a year in higher prices.\n\nYes, the economy sucks and people are hurting. But trade isn\u2019t to blame. It\u2019s lousy domestic policies \u2014 high taxes, massive regulations, ObamaCare, and such.\n\nSeth Mandell, writing in Commentary, said that it\u2019s possible to turn the tide of public opinion toward free trade, \u201cbut as long as presidential candidates play on the anti-trade instincts of so many voters, that\u2019s unlikely to happen.\u201d\n\nSad, but true.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Protectionism: Officially, the Republican Party is pro-free trade.
