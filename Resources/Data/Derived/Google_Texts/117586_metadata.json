But that\u2019s not the only way in which they\u2019re getting a helping hand from Congress.\n\nThe office of Rep. Diane Black (R-TN) issued a press release with a link to a bipartisan amicus brief signed by 207 members of Congress in support of the Little Sisters of the Poor. The amicus brief was sent to the Supreme Court in support of the Catholic group and other non-profit organizations in the upcoming case of Zubik vs. Burwell.\n\nSuch groups in the case object to signing a form which they argue makes them compliant in violating their faith when it comes to providing contraception and abortifacient drugs.\n\nBlack, as well as Rep. Mike Kelly (R-PA), Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-UT) and Sen. James Lankford (R-OK) who also signed on and announced the amicus brief, stressed religious liberty was at stake in the case.\n\nFrom Rep. Black\u2019s press release:\n\nIt is hard to imagine what could possibly be more pure or worthwhile than the ministry of Little Sisters of the Poor and the other religious nonprofits represented in this case. We should be praising their work, not punishing it. Sadly, that is exactly what Obamacare\u2019s coercive HHS mandate will do. The law sets up an impossible choice for these organizations: deny their deeply held beliefs and provide coverage for drugs they deem to be morally objectionable, or face crippling financial penalties from the federal government. This is a pivotal moment for religious freedom and I am honored to lend my voice and my prayers to the growing chorus calling on the Supreme Court to rectify this crisis and protect these time-honored rights from government attack when this case is heard later this year.\n\nRep. Mike Kelly stated:\n\nThe HHS mandate remains a hideous component of a disastrous law that puts government\u2019s power over people\u2019s rights. It puts this administration on the wrong side of our nation\u2019s long and cherished history of religious liberty and tolerance\u2014and deserves to be defeated. With this amicus brief, my colleagues and I stand side by side with the Little Sisters of the Poor and all those whose First Amendment rights have been trampled under this president\u2019s agenda. I expect the Supreme Court to ultimately free these heroic nuns from the mandate\u2019s oppressive penalties and allow them to continue serving a country where religious freedom is not just settled but celebrated. No government program or politician must ever be permitted to punish American citizens for peacefully following their faith\u2014period.\n\nFrom Sen. Lankford:\n\nThis bipartisan amicus brief articulates the great concern that many Americans have about our First Amendment right of the free exercise of religion. The case exposes the Obama administration\u2019s focus on freedom of worship as our primary religious right, instead of our freedom of religion, which includes our everyday lives. Colleges, universities and nonprofits should never be placed in a position where they have to violate their faith to please the government. The question before the Supreme Court should never have reached this level, but it is important for the future of our liberty that the Court now rule in favor of religious freedom.\n\nSenator Orrin Hatch noted that \u201creligious freedom is a fundamental right that government must respect and accommodate.\u201d\n\nWith any hope, the Supreme Court will agree with these members of Congress and the over 200 more. It is not merely religious liberty which is at stake here, but religious liberty to protect life from the moment it begins at conception.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The brief was bipartisan, and was sent to SCOTUS in support of the Catholic group and other non-profit orgs in the upcoming case of\u00a0Zubik vs. Burwell.", "og": {"site_name": "Live Action News", "description": "The brief was bipartisan, and was sent to SCOTUS in support of the Catholic group and other non-profit orgs in the upcoming case of\u00a0Zubik vs. Burwell.", "title": "207 members of Congress file amicus brief on behalf of Little Sisters of the Poor", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 672, "identifier": "http://liveactionnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Little-Sisters-of-the-Poor-672.jpg", "height": 372}, "updated_time": "2016-01-13T13:01:52-04:00", "url": "http://liveactionnews.org/207-members-congress-file-amicus-brief-behalf-little-sisters-poor/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The brief was bipartisan, and was sent to SCOTUS in support of the Catholic group and other non-profit orgs in the upcoming case of\u00a0Zubik vs. Burwell.", "creator": "@liveactionnews", "image": "http://liveactionnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Little-Sisters-of-the-Poor-672.jpg", "title": "207 members of Congress file amicus brief on behalf of Little Sisters of the Poor", "site": "@liveactionnews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "framework": "Alkivia Framework 0.8", "fb": {"admins": 159900244, "pages": 49651563727}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/liveactionnewsonline", "published_time": "2016-01-13T13:36:50-04:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/rebecca.rose.downs", "section": "Politics", "modified_time": "2016-01-13T13:01:52-04:00", "tag": "Zubik v.
