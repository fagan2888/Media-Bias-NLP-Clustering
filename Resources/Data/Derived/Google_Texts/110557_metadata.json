Although harvested bone from the patient, or autograft, is the gold standard, substitutes were introduced to the market in 1995 due to quantity limitations and chronic pain associated with the donor site.\n\nMost bone-graft substitutes can be categorized into one of the following areas:\n\nAllograft-based, also known as demineralized bone matric (DBM)\n\nGrowth-factor based (BMP)\n\nSynthetic, including polymer and ceramic-based materials\n\nReimbursement codes vary, based on the use of autograft or a bone substitute but in general reimbursement rates have remained steady. However, as the market evolves and new grafts are introduced and prices increase, cost-benefit analysis will become critical. While the use of bone-graft substitutes does add additional cost to the procedure, it prevents the need for an extra incision site or second operative procedure, and the trouble caused by obtaining the donor graft.\n\nLower prices are usually achievable by introducing competitive bids but additional savings can require some creativity such as agreeing to market share commitments. These agreements tend to give providers a good amount of leverage to reduce prices, but ensure physician alignment to prevent physician/vendor relationships from compromising your negotiation leverage.\n\nBone-Graft Substitutes\n\n5cc Demineralized Bone Matrix (DBM) Putty\n\nLow High Average\n\n$616.00 $865.00 $690.00\n\nRecombinant Human Bone Morphogenetic Protein (rhBMP) Matrix\n\nLow High Average\n\n$3,450.00 $5,000.00 $3,477.00\n\n5cc Synthetic \u2013 Ceramic & Polymer\u2013based\n\nLow High Average\n\n$893.00 $2,100.00 $1,320.00\n\nData source: MD Buyline (Please note these numbers have been adjusted to exclude special deals, outliers and unique circumstances.)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/blog/purchasing-insight-bone-graft-substitutes", "image": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/modules/open_graph/hfn-stacked.jpeg", "site_name": "Healthcare Finance News", "description": "Driven by an aging population and an expanding pool of younger patients, bone-graft substitutes are a $2.5 billion market, which should continue to rise as a result of minimally invasive procedures.", "title": "Purchasing Insight: Bone-graft substitutes"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/modules/open_graph/hfn-stacked.jpeg"}, "title": "Purchasing Insight: Bone-graft substitutes", "description": "Driven by an aging population and an expanding pool of younger patients, bone-graft substitutes are a $2.5 billion market, which should continue to rise as a result of minimally invasive procedures.", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@HC_Finance"}, "viewport": "width=device-width; initial-scale=1.0; maximum-scale=1.0; user-scalable=no", "description": "Driven by an aging population and an expanding pool of younger patients, bone-graft substitutes are a $2.5 billion market, which should continue to rise as a result of minimally invasive procedures.&#13; Bone-graft substitutes include both synthetic and natural materials used for the replacement of bone or bone tissues.
