In addition to being an astrophysicist, Schneps is also dyslexic, which means he joins approximately 15 percent of Americans in a struggle to read.\n\n\u201cWhen I read, I find it\u2019s very hard for me to kind of mentally lock on to the words,\u201d Schneps said.\n\nOne thing has helped, however \u2014 Schnep\u2019s smart phone, which helped him bridge the distance between his mind and the written word.\n\nBut was the device just helpful to him? Or it could it be helpful to others?\n\nIn a recent report for the National Science Foundation\u2019s \u201cScience Nation,\u201d NewsHour Science correspondent Miles O\u2019Brien covered Schneps\u2019 exploration of the smart phone as a better reading device for students.\n\nIn an initial study, Schneps monitored 100 students with dyslexia while they read on smart phones to see if it improved their comprehension of science, technology, engineering and math lessons. While it aided some students, not all were impacted.\n\nSchneps then turned to an eye tracker to see if students read faster on a smart phone or on a tablet. Overall, the students tested read faster on a smart phone.\n\nBecause people with dyslexia tend to get distracted by many words on one page, the key, according to Schneps, is only having two or three words in a line.\n\nWhile Schneps still has to uncover why some students benefit from reading on devices over paper, he is committed to finding an alternative for scholars like himself.\n\n\u201cFor me, the name of the game is to level the playing field,\u201d he said. \u201cTo make reading something that\u2019s not an impediment to success.\u201d\n\nMiles O\u2019Brien has more on this story for the National Science Foundation* series \u201cScience Nation.\u201d\n\n*For the record, the National Science Foundation is also an underwriter of the PBS NewsHour.", "article_metadata": {"description": "In a recent report for the National Science Foundation's \"Science Nation,\" NewsHour Science correspondent Miles O'Brien explored how smart phones could help people who are dyslexic with their reading skills.", "pubdate": 20140911, "og": {"site_name": "PBS NewsHour", "description": "In a recent report for the National Science Foundation's \"Science Nation,\" NewsHour Science correspondent Miles O'Brien explored how smart phones could help people who are dyslexic with their reading skills.", "title": "For dyslexic students, are smart phones easier to read than books?", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://newshour-tc.pbs.org/newshour/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/dyslexia.jpg", "url": "http://www.pbs.org/newshour/updates/smart-phones-beat-paper-best-device-reading/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "PBS NewsHour", "description": "In a recent report for the National Science Foundation's \"Science Nation,\" NewsHour Science correspondent Miles O'Brien explored how smart phones could help people who are dyslexic with their reading skills.", "title": "For dyslexic students, are smart phones easier to read than books?", "image": "http://newshour-tc.pbs.org/newshour/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/dyslexia.jpg", "creator": "@newshour", "site": "@newshour", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp,noydir", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "fb": {"app_id": 114150878604116}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/newshour", "tag": "science nation"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "Dyslexia, science nation"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1544\"", "article_summary": "One thing has helped, however \u2014 Schnep\u2019s smart phone, which helped him bridge the distance between his mind and the written word.\nSchneps then turned to an eye tracker to see if students read faster on a smart phone or on a tablet.\n\u201cWhen I read, I find it\u2019s very hard for me to kind of mentally lock on to the words,\u201d Schneps said.\nOverall, the students tested read faster on a smart phone.\nIn an initial study, Schneps monitored 100 students with dyslexia while they read on smart phones to see if it improved their comprehension of science, technology, engineering and math lessons."}
