(Photo: Getty Images)\n\nWe hope 30 years of Republican propaganda against the Clintons has not worked on voters. All the investigations, all the hearing have not amounted to a hill of beans.\n\nThere is no perfect candidate, only a matter of looking at the big picture and setting priorities. Think about the future, if not for yourself then for your kids and grandkids: Do you want Sarah Palin as secretary of State? We will be the laughing stock of the world. How about Mike Huckabee as secretary of Health and Human Services. Do you think he\u2019ll be an advocate for the least privileged of our country?\n\nHow about three new Scalias or other super-conservatives on the Supreme Court? If you do not care about women\u2019s right to equal pay and choice, don\u2019t vote for Hillary.\n\nWhat about the homeless, the environment, poor folks, domestic violence? Do you really think Donald Trump would do anything about those? He thinks folks on Supplemental Security Income are getting too much and Medicare needs to be cut and privatized. Obamacare will be dismantled. Poor and middle class folks will lose their health care and be back to using emergency rooms.\n\nWhat do you think about that?\n\nThey are also talking about cutting benefits to vets, especially those who were wounded. Have you ever enjoyed our National Parks? They\u2019ll be gone and privatized.\n\nDo think every citizen has the right to vote? You can forget about that in a Trump presidency. We will have even more money in politics, so our representatives can be bought and paid for by the rich.\n\nIf you don\u2019t vote, who are you helping to elect?\n\nWe care about the most vulnerable in our society. Whoever is elected will not affect our status very much. But our country will be set back at least 30 years. We are thinking of subsequent generations.\n\nIf this sounds harsh, it\u2019s because we speak from our hearts and minds.\n\nHillary is not evil \u2013 not the perfect candidate, but not evil. Even if you think she is the lesser of two evils, not voting for her will help elect the greater of two evils.\n\nRuta Vaskys and Martin Freed live in Quinby.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://www.delmarvanow.com/story/opinion/2016/05/25/things-think-voting/84860042/", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "If you don\u2019t vote, who are you helping to elect?", "og": {"site_name": "Delmarva Daily Times", "description": "If you don\u2019t vote, who are you helping to elect?", "title": "Things to think about before voting", "url": "http://www.delmarvanow.com/story/opinion/2016/05/25/things-think-voting/84860042/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/delmarvanow.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "If you don\u2019t vote, who are you helping to elect?", "creator": "@MyDelmarvaNow", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/636d5e000ca69d9cca7390bf5f056cbc8662e898/c=0-264-1565-1829&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2016/05/24/Salisbury/B9322288224Z.1_20160524173630_000_GOIEFIGFF.1-0.jpg", "title": "Things to think about before voting", "site": "@MyDelmarvaNow", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=858745131", "fb": {"app_id": 179822335370394}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": "2016 presidential campaign, hillary clinton, donald trump"}, "article_summary": "Even if you think she is the lesser of two evils, not voting for her will help elect the greater of two evils.\nThink about the future, if not for yourself then for your kids and grandkids: Do you want Sarah Palin as secretary of State?\nWhat about the homeless, the environment, poor folks, domestic violence?\nIf you don\u2019t vote, who are you helping to elect?\nIf you do not care about women\u2019s right to equal pay and choice, don\u2019t vote for Hillary."}
