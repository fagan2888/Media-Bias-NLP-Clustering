Patients may pay more for biosimilar drugs than they would the original product, according to a report out today from Avalere Health, an independent consulting firm.

Biosimilars, like generics, are expected to be less expensive than the primary innovator product. But higher out-of-pocket costs under Medicare Part D could discourage beneficiaries from using biosimilars, the report says.

Avalere suggests requiring manufacturer discounts to close the coverage gap for biosimilars and creating a biosimilar tier that would reduce beneficiary costs for biosimilars to the same level as the reference products as policy solutions.

“The unintended consequence of the ACA is that consumers have a financial disincentive to switch to a lower-cost biosimilar,” Caroline Pearson, senior vice president at Avalere, said in a statement. “While the Medicare program will save money if beneficiaries take biosimilars, higher consumer out-of-pocket costs are a barrier to patient adoption.”

The Food and Drug Administration has so far approved two biosimilar products for use.
