Good morning, class. Remember, no running. Please take your seats and take out your textbooks.

It has been a long time since most of us have had a first day of school. But anyone who has every had one can remember the sights and sounds, the return to the school year's rituals and routines, the mixture of nervousness and excitement and the sense of the new school year as something familiar and something new at the same time.

Today is the first day of classes for students in districts throughout the region, which also means it's the first day of school for thousands of teachers, school administrators and support staff. It's a return to school routines for bus drivers, educational aides and, not least of all, parents.

Of course, this also means, regardless of what the calendar says, that summer is over â€” not that it's felt a whole lot like summer around here lately.

Some questions for today that occurred to us: In the social media age, do kids still ask, "How was your summer?" In lieu of a "How I spent my summer vacation" essay, can students simply submit a link to their Instagram feeds? Given how over-scheduled and over-extended some kids are, would the "How I spent my summer vacation" essay have to be novel-length?

It's a different time. But we suspect the nervous energy of the first day of school is something timeless.

Welcome back.
