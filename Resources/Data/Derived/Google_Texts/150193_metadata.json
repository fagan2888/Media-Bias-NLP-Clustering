This basic result appears robust to various forms of statistical quibbling around family size and family structure.\n\nBut is it right? I'm skeptical.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nSo where's the offsetting decline? I suppose it is possible that the quantity and quality of apparel and furniture owned by the average American family has declined so rapidly as to offset the improvements in housing, transportation, and entertainment. But it doesn't seem to me that you hear people waxing nostalgic about the great refrigerators they used to be able to afford in 1983 and how much better they are than the crap they have to settle for today.\n\nThe census data says what it says, but I don't believe it. The moral of the story seems to me to be one about the perils of using consumer price index deflators over long time horizons. An alternative explanation, given by Scott Winship, is that progressive taxation and welfare state programs account for the discrepency between rising living standards in the real world and census statistics calling it stagnation or decline.", "article_metadata": {"fb-share": "The Census Says Median Family Income Has Fallen Since 1989\u2014Should We Believe Them", "sailthru.author": "Matthew Yglesias", "description": "Census Bureau data released Tuesday reveal the striking fact that inflation-adjusted median family income has fallen slightly since 1989.
