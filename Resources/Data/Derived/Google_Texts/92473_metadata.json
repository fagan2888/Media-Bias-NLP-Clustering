So says a new study of the American political system.\n\nThere are certainly a few Senate and House races that may turn on issues of war, immigration reform, jobs, the economy and federal spending \u2013 and the competing candidates\u2019 differences. The outcome of those few races will likely determine whether Republicans regain control of both chambers of Congress for the first time in nearly a decade.\n\nRelated: Nervous Republicans Play It Safe Before Midterms\n\nAs two veteran journalists discovered in an exhaustive study of the 2014 primary season for the Brookings Institution, the campaign trail has become largely an information-free zone where political affiliations and party boilerplate count for far more than substantive discourse.\n\nOr as Jill Lawrence and Walter Shapiro, the two political columnists enlisted for the \u201cPrimaries Project\u201d noted Tuesday, \u201cThe closer you get the worse it looks.\u201d\n\nLawrence and Shapiro said they attempted to discern patterns in the races and \u201ctease out the internal issue debates among Republicans and Democrats.\u201d They hoped to create a fuller picture of the midterm election cycle by carefully evaluating the statements, political ads and campaign websites of over 200 candidates in more than 60 House primary races.\n\nWhat they learned should come as little surprise in an era of political polarization: The \u201cnationalization of politics\u201d had wiped out just about all originality in House races.\n\nRelated: Why the GOP Can\u2019t Count on a Midterm Wave Election\n\nOne exception was the impact of the Tea Party during the primary season. While far-right Tea Party challengers with their anti-government, anti-tax, anti-Obamacare rhetoric failed to unseat any GOP incumbents in the Senate, they did manage to score half a dozen victories in House contests that will assure them of congressional seats next year.\n\nBeyond that, though, the races were largely paint-by-the-numbers partisan exercises that were either lacking in substantive discussions or marked by trivial attacks.\n\n\u201cWhat we did discover . . . were the fault lines in both parties and the areas of lockstep political conformity,\u201d the journalists wrote.\n\n\u201cPeople are choosing their candidates based on the \u2018D\u2019 or \u2018R\u2019 after their names,\u201d Lawrence said at a seminar on the findings yesterday at Brookings. \u201cIt\u2019s a low-information environment. It\u2019s not like they know exactly which faction of the party a candidate is from.\u201d\n\nRelated: Gallup Poll: 2014 Midterms Not a Slam Dunk for Incumbents\n\nThe most striking finding, said Lawrence, was \u201chow generic and standardized these races had become\u201d and \u201chow old and tired the party platforms are.\u201d\n\nThe report is entitled \u201cPhoning It In and Failing to Show: The Story of the 2014 House Primaries.\u201d It provides hard-edged analyses of how the two parties danced around some of the most important issues of the day. Here\u2019s what the journalists found:\n\nObamacare: Though President Obama\u2019s signature health care law remains highly unpopular in the polls, \u201cit has not risen to the point of inflaming half the nation,\u201d much to the chagrin of conservatives, the authors found. Throughout the primary season, the ACA \u201cwas more like wallpaper\u201d than a burning issue.\n\nThe party positions were so generic and consistent \u201cthat both sides seemed to be on automatic pilot.\u201d A few Democrats reflected liberal displeasure with the law, but they were the exceptions to those who adopted a \u201cmend it, don\u2019t end it\u201d approach that large majorities favored over scrapping the law. \u201cIn the Republican Party \u2013 so intent on killing Obamacare that Texas\n\nSen. Ted Cruz would have shut down the government rather than fund the law \u2013 adamant, even angry calls for full-out repeal were campaign boilerplate.\u201d\n\nRelated: Why Business Should Hire the Long-Term Unemployed\n\nThe Economy: The economic stands taken by many in the primaries reinforced the \u201cpolicy ruts\u201d both parties have been in for decades. \u201cRepublicans are still living in the Reagan era, when small-government rhetoric (if not reality) was the answer to all questions,\u201d Lawrence and Shapiro wrote. \u201cDemocrats are living at least partially in the New Deal, even though those programs badly need changes to avert a budget-busting nightmare.\u201d\n\nA few Democrats said they were open to reforming entitlements, but that did little to fire up the party faithful who vote in primaries. \u201cThe economy was second only to the Affordable Care Act in illuminating the vast gap between Democrats and Republicans,\u201d the authors wrote.\n\nImmigration Reform: The Democratic consensus on comprehensive immigration reform was \u201crendered almost invisible\u201d in the primaries, where it wasn\u2019t mentioned or the candidates said roughly the same thing. Candidates knew they would be accused of the \u201ca\u201d word\u2014amnesty.\n\nYet \u201cthe volume level was high on the Republican side, the primary season unfolding against a din of anti-reform rhetoric and calls for draconian security,\u201d Lawrence and Shapiro wrote. Some GOP candidates were very discerning or subtle in voicing their opinions, reflecting the economic and philosophical variations of their districts.\n\nFor example, \u201cThe level of opposition to immigration reform among Republicans was often inversely proportional to the importance of agriculture in a district, and the money spent on behalf of farmers and others reliant upon immigrant labor and skills.\u201d\n\nRelated: Voters Know What We Should Do on Immigration\n\nNational Security and War: The primary season unfolded last spring and summer amid dramatic foreign policy crises \u2013 from Russia seizing Crimea in mid-March and Islamic militants spreading panic by overrunning Mosul in Iraq in mid-June. Yet \u201cwith the exception of paeans to Israel, congressional candidates in both parties almost completely ignored the world on the other side of the ocean,\u201d the authors wrote.\n\n\u201cIt was not so much isolationism as profound indifference,\u201d they said. \u201cMost candidates did not even discuss national security or international affairs on their campaign issues pages.\u201d Moreover, 68 percent of Republican candidates and 79 percent of Democratic candidates didn\u2019t take a position on defense spending. That is changing: Republicans see an advantage in raising national security issues after President Obama stepped up U.S. airstrikes against ISIS forces in northern Iraq and Syria.\n\nNSA Surveillance: Revelations about the National Security Agency\u2019s surveillance of foreign nationals and U.S. citizens shocked the nation and triggered congressional oversight of the government\u2019s Internet and telephone snooping. One might have expected this to be a topic of debate within each party.\n\n\u201cYet, like defense spending, it was virtually ignored,\u201d the authors wrote. \u201cThree quarters of all Republican candidates and slightly more than three quarters of all Democratic candidates simply didn\u2019t offer any opinion on the issue \u2026 Among Republicans, self-identified libertarian candidates talked about their opposition to NSA surveillance but they were the smallest faction among Republican candidates \u2013 and ultimately the least successful in the primaries.\u201d\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "If past is prologue, then the quality of the issues debates in the final month of the mid-term congressional campaigns should be about as devoid of substance what voters heard during the primary contests, according to a new study of the American political system.", "title": "The 5 Key Issues Most 2014 Candidates Have Ignored", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/10/01/5-Key-Issues-Most-2014-Candidates-Have-Ignored", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/04042012_Woman_Voting_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/10/01/5-Key-Issues-Most-2014-Candidates-Have-Ignored", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/04042012_Woman_Voting_article.jpg", "title": "The Fiscal Times", "card": "summary", "creator": "@ericpianin"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "If past is prologue, then the quality of the issues debates in the final month of the mid-term congressional campaigns should be about as devoid of substance what voters heard during the primary contests, according to a new study of the American political system.", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0b72\"", "article_summary": "\u201cMost candidates did not even discuss national security or international affairs on their campaign issues pages.\u201d Moreover, 68 percent of Republican candidates and 79 percent of Democratic candidates didn\u2019t take a position on defense spending.\n\u201cThree quarters of all Republican candidates and slightly more than three quarters of all Democratic candidates simply didn\u2019t offer any opinion on the issue \u2026 Among Republicans, self-identified libertarian candidates talked about their opposition to NSA surveillance but they were the smallest faction among Republican candidates \u2013 and ultimately the least successful in the primaries.\u201dTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:\nThroughout the primary season, the ACA \u201cwas more like wallpaper\u201d than a burning issue.\nRelated: Why the GOP Can\u2019t Count on a Midterm Wave ElectionOne exception was the impact of the Tea Party during the primary season.\nThere are certainly a few Senate and House races that may turn on issues of war, immigration reform, jobs, the economy and federal spending \u2013 and the competing candidates\u2019 differences."}
