The second open enrollment period of the Affordable Care Act saw a 74 percent increase over last year.

A total of 25,036 Delawareans signed up for health care coverage through the health insurance marketplace, according to a report released by the U.S. Dept. of Health and Human Services on Tuesday. In 2014, 14,397 Delawareans enrolled in coverage.

The federal report covers activity from Nov. 15, 2014, through Feb. 22, 2015.

Delaware Dept. of Health and Social Services Secretary Rita Landgraf said the total number includes first-time sign-ups, those who renewed their plans and individuals who were "in line" by the Feb. 15 open-enrollment deadline and were given a week to finish picking their plan.

"I am very pleased that so many Delawareans are finding coverage that meets their health needs and their budget," Landgraf said. "These numbers show that when it comes to broadening access to quality care for all residents, regardless of gender, income level, pre-existing conditions or other previous barriers, the Affordable Care Act is working."

A further breakdown of the Delaware numbers released in the federal report show:

Of those who selected a 2015 plan, 51 percent signed up for the first time and 49 percent re-enrolled, either actively or through automatic renewal

84 percent who selected plans qualified for financial assistance on their monthly premiums, up from the 81 percent in 2014

Enrollees by age: 26 percent are ages 55-64 22 percent are 45-54 15 percent ages 35-44 15 percent ages 26-348 8 percent ages 18-25 13 percent younger than 18 23 percent are ages 18-34, the so-called "young invincibles"

5,985 Delawareans were assessed eligible for Medicaid or the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP)

The report did not include information on how many consumers have paid their first monthly premiums to begin their coverage.

Nationwide, nearly 11.7 million Americans selected a plan or were automatically re-enrolled this year, according to the report.

Those who remain uninsured in 2015 and aren't exempt from having coverage will face a penalty of $325 per person ($162.50 per child under 18) or 2 percent of annual household income, whichever is higher.

The federal government recently announced a special enrollment period from March 15 to April 30 for those who owe a penalty for being uninsured in 2014 and who can attest that they first became aware of the fee or understood its implications after the end of open enrollment on Feb.15 while preparing their 2014 taxes.

The next open enrollment period for 2016 coverage through the marketplace runs from Nov. 1, 2015, to Jan. 31, 2016.
