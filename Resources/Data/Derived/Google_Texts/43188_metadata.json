'Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell' is the largest scale project that Screen Yorkshire has invested in and it will spend more than six months shooting in the region at an incredible range of locations across North and West Yorkshire including York, Leeds, Ripley, Wakefield and Rotherham.\n\n\"We are privileged to be able to attract such major productions to film in the region through the Yorkshire Content Fund. As well as showcasing landmark locations such as York Minster, which will doubtless inspire visitors to Yorkshire for years to come, the production will have a major economic impact for crew, facilities and local businesses such as hotels, taxis and restaurants.''\n\nThe series stars Eddie Marsan (Best of Men, Ray Donovan, Filth) and Olivier award-winning Bertie Carvel (Restless, Hidden, Matilda) in the lead roles.\n\nThe series is directed by Toby Haynes (The Musketeers, Doctor Who) and the producer is Nick Hirschkorn (Five Children And It). It is produced by Cuba Pictures (Boy A, Broken) for BBC One and co-produced with BBC America, in association with Feel Films, Far Moor, Screen Yorkshire and Bell Media's Space. It will be distributed by Endemol Worldwide Distribution.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Scenes for the new BBC drama series Jonathan Strange and Mr Norrell are being shot at York Minster and the neighbouring St William's College.", "title": "BBC shooting new drama at York Minster", "og": {"image": "http://d2.christiantoday.com/en/full/18807/york-minster.jpg", "description": "Scenes for the new BBC drama series Jonathan Strange and Mr Norrell are being shot at York Minster and the neighbouring St William's College.", "title": "BBC shooting new drama at York Minster"}, "HandheldFriendly": "True", "p": {"domain_verify": "035da258d4370c219fc1e27db5605a75"}, "MobileOptimized": 320, "Keywords": "christian news,christianity,evangelical,York Minster,BBC,Jonathan Strange and Mr Norrell,TV,Television,Filming", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fccb3f\"", "article_summary": "01 March 2014Scenes for the new BBC drama series Jonathan Strange and Mr Norrell are being shot at York Minster and the neighbouring St William's College.\n\"To have such a key role at the start of this series is fantastic for York Minster,\" said York Minster's marketing director Nicola Bexon.\nIt is produced by Cuba Pictures (Boy A, Broken) for BBC One and co-produced with BBC America, in association with Feel Films, Far Moor, Screen Yorkshire and Bell Media's Space.\nSally Joynson, Chief Executive at Screen Yorkshire, said: \"We are delighted that York Minster will play such a key role in another one of Screen Yorkshire's productions.\nFilming has been taking place across Yorkshire since October and shooting got underway at the historic Gothic cathedral this week."}
