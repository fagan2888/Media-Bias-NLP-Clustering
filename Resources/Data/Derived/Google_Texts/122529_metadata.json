They assume that degree is the only gateway to the American middle class.\n\nIt shouldn\u2019t be.\n\nFor one thing, a four-year liberal arts degree is hugely expensive. Too many young people graduate laden with debts that take years if not decades to pay off.\n\nAnd too many of them can\u2019t find good jobs when they graduate, in any event. So they have to settle for jobs that don\u2019t require four years of college. They end up overqualified for the work they do, and underwhelmed by it.\n\nOthers drop out of college because they\u2019re either unprepared or unsuited for a four-year liberal arts curriculum. When they leave, they feel like failures.\n\nWe need to open other gateways to the middle class.\n\nConsider, for example, technician jobs. They don\u2019t require a four-year degree. But they do require mastery over a domain of technical knowledge, which can usually be obtained in two years.\n\nTechnician jobs are growing in importance. As digital equipment replaces the jobs of routine workers and lower-level professionals, technicians are needed to install, monitor, repair, test, and upgrade all the equipment.\n\nHospital technicians are needed to monitor ever more complex equipment that now fills medical centers; office technicians, to fix the hardware and software responsible for much of the work that used to be done by secretaries and clerks.\n\nAutomobile technicians are in demand to repair the software that now powers our cars; manufacturing technicians, to upgrade the numerically controlled machines and 3-D printers that have replaced assembly lines; laboratory technicians, to install and test complex equipment for measuring results; telecommunications technicians, to install, upgrade, and repair the digital systems linking us to one another.\n\nTechnology is changing so fast that knowledge about specifics can quickly become obsolete. That\u2019s why so much of what technicians learn is on the job.\n\nBut to be an effective on-the-job learner, technicians need basic knowledge of software and engineering, along the domain where the technology is applied \u2013 hospitals, offices, automobiles, manufacturing, laboratories, telecommunications, and so forth.\n\nYet America isn\u2019t educating the technicians we need. As our aspirations increasingly focus on four-year college degrees, we\u2019ve allowed vocational and technical education to be downgraded and denigrated.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The former secretary of labor on our broken higher ed model and how we can open more gateways to the middle class", "title": "Robert Reich: College is a ludicrous waste of money", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The former secretary of labor on our broken higher ed model and how we can open more gateways to the middle class", "title": "Robert Reich: College is a ludicrous waste of money", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/09/03/robert_reich_college_is_a_ludicrous_waste_of_money_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/01/robert_reich.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The former secretary of labor on our broken higher ed model and how we can open more gateways to the middle class", "title": "Robert Reich: College is a ludicrous waste of money", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/01/robert_reich.jpg", "creator": "@rbreich", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Robert Reich", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, College, Education, Higher education, Ivy Leagues, RobertReich.org, University", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd922e\"", "article_summary": "As our aspirations increasingly focus on four-year college degrees, we\u2019ve allowed vocational and technical education to be downgraded and denigrated.\nThey don\u2019t require a four-year degree.\nSo they have to settle for jobs that don\u2019t require four years of college.\nOthers drop out of college because they\u2019re either unprepared or unsuited for a four-year liberal arts curriculum.\nTopics: College, Education, Higher education, Ivy Leagues, RobertReich.org, University, Business News, Politics NewsThis originally appeared on Robert Reich's blogThis week, millions of young people head to college and universities, aiming for a four-year liberal arts degree."}
