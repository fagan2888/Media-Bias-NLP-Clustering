He was also excluded from taking part in all federal health care programs for 20 years. Hamilton now operates Icon Pediatrics, a concierge pediatrics medical practice that does not bill insurance or Medicaid claims, and that has medical commercial real estate holdings, including some in which Capstone Pediatrics is a tenant.\n\nHamilton said he is Capstone\u2019s largest creditor, but bankruptcy attorney Griffin Dunham, who is representing the company, said Capstone disagrees with Hamilton on this point.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a dispute about whether Dr. Hamilton is a creditor,\u201d said Dunham, a member with Nashville-based Emerge Law. \u201cBased on the facts and issues that have arisen after the purchase, Capstone intends to defend against any assertion that Dr. Hamilton is owed anything.\u201d\n\nAccording to court documents, Capstone said the practice was \u201cfraught with compliance issues, IT issues, manpower issues, and oppressive contracts with rental rates in excess of fair market value\u201d when they bought it.\n\n\u201cCapstone\u2019s top priority is, and always will be, unparalleled patient care,\u201d Dunham said. \u201cBut despite its top-notch patient care, problems that existed before Capstone purchased the assets forced the reorganization. Among other things, lease expenses needed to be reduced and employees needed better benefits. Once these are addressed, Capstone\u2019s financial position will be even stronger and more sustainable.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe counterpoint\n\nHamilton has a different view of the situation. He said when the practice was initially purchased in 2013, he stayed on as an employee and advisor.\n\n\u201dThey (Capstone owners) didn\u2019t really seek or accept my input,\u201d he said. \u201cI left the practice with clean books and didn\u2019t leave them with any accounts payable.\n\n\u201cIn hindsight, they were probably undercapitalized,\u201d Hamilton added. \u201cI think they probably got into a deficit right from the start. I believe they made a number of decisions that they alone were responsible for and some things were out of their control. Perhaps they didn\u2019t fully appreciate the health care environment they were going into.\u201d\n\nHamilton said Capstone \u201chas never been able to consistently pay\u201d installments on the promissory note connected to its purchase of the practice.\n\n\u201cI spent 25 years building the practice,\u201d Hamilton said. \u201cI\u2019m concerned about children in our community who are not being served.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe numbers\n\nCapstone\u2019s initial Chapter 11 petition (filed late last year) showed total assets between $1 million and $10 million and liabilities in the $10 million to $50 million range. The list of creditors holding the largest unsecured claims, according to the filing and that Capstone is challenging, includes Hamilton ($3,357,178), the Internal Revenue Services ($1,277,270) and Physician Sales & Service Inc. ($304,517).\n\nIn 2014, gross revenues at Capstone were $24,858,435, according to the filing.\n\nAs a physician-owned practice, Capstone is bucking a growing trend of health care providers working for hospitals rather than joining independent physicians groups or having solo practices.\n\nIf there\u2019s one thing that Hamilton and the Capstone owners agree on, it\u2019s that the physician-owned model of health care is difficult to navigate in today\u2019s world.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s tremendously challenging for independent practices in today\u2019s health care environment,\u201d Griffieth said. \u201cWe\u2019re not alone and are facing pressure from every direction. There\u2019s little margin for error or the unexpected hiccups that can arise.\n\n\u201cMargins for a pediatric practices are minimal, at 3-7 percent on average,\u201d he added. \u201cWhen we purchased the practice, we had to do significant due diligence. We spent the first six months adding structure for compliance, IT and other systems to build a strong base for efficient, high-quality, coordinated care that\u2019s expected of a pediatric center of excellence. From day one, we were climbing uphill. But we\u2019ve always been and will be committed to the practice\u2019s success and health of the community.\u201d\n\nCaring for a significant number of TennCare/Medicare patients added to the complexity of the operating environment.\n\n\u201cAt the same time, reimbursements for the care we provide have decreased,\u201d Griffieth said. \u201cAs of Jan. 1, 2015, TennCare reimbursements to physicians were reduced when the state decided it wouldn\u2019t be able to supplement the matching federal funds that were put into place as part of the Affordable Care Act. Reimbursement rates reverted to 2012 levels, representing a 25-30 percent decrease in payments for the care we provide. As a result, we\u2019ve worked hard to renegotiate our contracts with several payers.\u201d\n\nHamilton said he needed more help than he realized.\n\n\u201cWhen I look back, I see that I was running the practice like a small business,\u201d Hamilton said. \u201cIt grew to be the largest practice in the state in its specialty. I kept operating it like it was a small business, but I should have run it like a corporation. I didn\u2019t have a formal business team in place, which made navigating the regulatory environment very hard.\u201d\n\nAt its peak, the practice was serving about 80,000 patients a year, Hamilton said.\n\nGriffieth said Capstone now provides pediatric and adolescent care to approximately 30,000 patients a year \u2014 ranging from newborns to people age 20 \u2014 and has a care team of 140 people, including pediatricians, nurse practitioners, physician assistants and support staff.\n\nDunham believes the Chapter 11 restructuring will be successful.\n\n\"Capstone\u2019s management is uniquely qualified to navigate the company through the reorganization,\u201d he said. \u201cSo qualified, in fact, that the Bankruptcy Court waived the requirement to appoint an ombudsman over the case. Although many might want to point fingers at Dr. Hamilton, Capstone prefers to focus on the strengths of its current management, its strong financial outlook and providing the best patient care available.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Company counters ex-owner's claim as practice's largest creditor", "og": {"image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://r1.nashvillepost.com/files/base/scomm/nvp/image/2016/02/640w/Captsone_logo.56b13d921be2b.jpg", "height": 360}, "site_name": "Nashville Post", "description": "Company counters ex-owner's claim as practice's largest creditor", "title": "Capstone files for bankruptcy with dispute as backdrop | Nashville Post"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "google-site-verification": "o_O5_bdskNaHgbV0mHqd8wA_IMrDlmcgCIhZcz_QpYU", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "\u201cThere\u2019s a dispute about whether Dr. Hamilton is a creditor,\u201d said Dunham, a member with Nashville-based Emerge Law.\nHe was also excluded from taking part in all federal health care programs for 20 years.\nHamilton said he is Capstone\u2019s largest creditor, but bankruptcy attorney Griffin Dunham, who is representing the company, said Capstone disagrees with Hamilton on this point.\n\u201cMargins for a pediatric practices are minimal, at 3-7 percent on average,\u201d he added.\nAs a physician-owned practice, Capstone is bucking a growing trend of health care providers working for hospitals rather than joining independent physicians groups or having solo practices."}
