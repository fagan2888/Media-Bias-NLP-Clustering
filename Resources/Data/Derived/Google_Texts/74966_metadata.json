(AP) - Twice a day, five days a week, for the better part of 18 years, Lori Jones has ridden the ferry across the Ohio River from Sistersville to Fly in the morning and back in the afternoon.\n\nWithout it, she\u2019d be putting an extra 70-plus miles on her car each time she went to and from her job in Ohio.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s faster to get home in the evening and to my kids\u2019 athletic events,\u201d Jones said, sitting in her car as the Sistersville Ferry made its way back to the Mountain State side of the Ohio River at Sistersville.\n\nAbout an hour-and-a-half earlier, Ft. Lauderdale, Fla., residents Don and Diane Karney were in line in their car to go from West Virginia to Ohio by ferry. Diane is originally from Alma and her mother still lives in the area.\n\n\u201c(When) we come up here, we always try to hit the ferry,\u201d Don Karney said. \u201cIt\u2019s unique. We don\u2019t have anything like that in Florida.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s nothing else like it in West Virginia either, said Eric Peters, executive director of the Tyler County Development Authority and chairman of Sistersville\u2019s ferry board. The Sistersville ferry began operating 196 years ago and is the only commercial ferry still running in West Virginia, as well as the only one on the Ohio River north of Cincinnati.\n\nJones and Karney typify the uses and users of the ferry: the local residents who use it as an extension of West Virginia 18 and the visitors who consider riding it a novelty.\n\nRidership has been declining in recent years as plants like Ormet Corp.\u2019s Hannibal facility have closed, but Peters said the ferry is still useful as oil and gas activity in the region builds.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very important for those companies that that ferry be available,\u201d he said.\n\nTyler is the only county in West Virginia on the Ohio River where there is no bridge spanning the river. Besides the ferry, drivers have the option of a 36-mile round trip to cross the Hi Carpenter Bridge linking St. Marys and Newport or a 28-mile trek to cross at New Martinsville, Peters said.\n\nBill Schleier, who is captain of the ferry along with Herman Hause, said vehicle usage has ranged from 58 to 100 a day.\n\nIn years past, \u201cthose would be considered pretty poor days,\u201d said Schleier, who\u2019s worked on the ferry four years, two as a deckhand and two as a captain. \u201cOne hundred fifty, 200 was not unusual.\u201d\n\nOn this day, Schleier had to deal with heavy fog in the morning, negotiate debris throughout the day, deal with heavier-than-usual barge traffic and sit and wait when a pop-up thunderstorm hit with lightning striking a little too close for comfort to the mostly metal boat and 32-ton barge.\n\nThey weren\u2019t ideal conditions, but in a way, Schleier said, it wasn\u2019t that unusual of a day.\n\n\u201cIt is kind of typical, \u2018cause you never know what\u2019s going to happen,\u201d he said.\n\nSome might see operation of the ferry as a simple back-and-forth proposition, but those folks aren\u2019t manning the steering sticks in the wheelhouse. Schleier makes anywhere from 50 to 75 landings a day between the Ohio and West Virginia sides and \u201cevery landing is a little bit different depending on the wind, the current and the load on the barge,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cBut that\u2019s part of the fun. I love this job,\u201d Schleier said.\n\nEven turning the boat as it switches sides of the river is more complicated than the uninitiated might realize. The barge stays pointed in the same general direction, but the captain detaches the boat, turning it around 180 degrees as the barge floats before reconnecting with a hydraulic latch.\n\nTraffic was light this day with no more than two cars on the ferry at a time after the thunderstorm.\n\n\u201cIf the weather is nice, you get a lot more riders,\u201d Schleier said. \u201cDays like today, it\u2019s the hardcore riders.\u201d\n\nWhile a number of riders use the ferry to get from point A to point B, the ferry is a destination for others.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen like a minivan pull on, and they\u2019ll have, like, four or five generations,\u201d Schleier said.\n\nOnce he met a man from Germany who had researched ferries in the United States and put Sistersville on his itinerary.\n\n\u201cHe wanted to go across every river he could,\u201d Schleier said.\n\nMotorcycle and classic car groups from Cleveland, Pittsburgh and other places include the ferry in their routes, Peters said.\n\nThe range of people who ride the ferry is part of the appeal for senior deckhand Franklin Smith, who moved to the area with his wife last year.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a sociable person, so I get to see people from all different states,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s a nice, calm, relaxing job, most of the time.\u201d\n\nThe barge can carry eight cars, but also transports semis, box trucks and dump trucks, motorcycles, bicycles and pedestrians. Fares range from $1 for walkers and bicyclists to $3 for motorcycles, $4 for cars and trucks, up to $15 for a semi.\n\nThis year, the ferry board started a pass system where people can get six trips for the price of five. The ferry can also be rented for parties at a rate of $200 for two hours or $250 for three.\n\nThe fares generally pay for operation of the ferry, Peters said. State and federal grants are used to fund major repairs, but there is no regular appropriation from either level.\n\n\u201cThis ferry is city-owned, but it is a continuation of West Virginia Route 18. So Route 18 doesn\u2019t end until that ferry touches the Ohio side,\u201d Peters said. \u201cBut for many decades, the city (of Sistersville) was expected to maintain (that part of) Route 18 for the state.\u201d\n\nIn 2011, Sistersville City Council voted to cease operations of the ferry, but received word a day later that a $25,000 Local Economic Development Grant from the governor\u2019s office had been secured to keep it running.\n\nPeters did not have budget numbers readily available, but he said in the last two years the ferry has just broken even.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s about it,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve not been able to begin a new season with a cash reserve, at least not from operations.\u201d\n\nThe ferry is in the process of drawing down $158,302 in U.S. Department of Transportation grants to address repairs and maintenance of the boat and its landings. A couple of years ago, the board received carryover funds from the West Virginia Public Port Authority that paid for replacement of the boat\u2019s transmission. However, that money is no longer available thanks to changes at the state level, Peters said.\n\nAn infusion of state funding is expected to be announced next week, with $15,000 coming from a Community Participation Grant secured by Senate President Jeff Kessler, D-Marshall, and Sen. Larry Edgell, D-Wetzel. Additional funds are expected to come from the House thanks to Delegate Roger Romine, R-Doddridge, Peters said.\n\nThat money can be used for operations.\n\n\u201cWe have substantial fuel bills and things of that nature that have to be addressed,\u201d Peters said.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: News and Sentinel (Parkersburg, W.Va.), http://www.newsandsentinel.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "Twice a day, five days a week, for the better part of 18 years, Lori Jones has ridden the ferry across the Ohio River from Sistersville to Fly in the morning and back in the afternoon.", "Author": "EVAN BEVINS", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Twice a day, five days a week, for the better part of 18 years, Lori Jones has ridden the ferry across the Ohio River from Sistersville to Fly in the morning and back in the afternoon.", "title": "W.Va. ferry transport for some, novelty for others", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/jul/5/wva-ferry-transport-for-some-novelty-for-others/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/07/05/fce94faac860bf19580f6a7067001491.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/07/05/fce94faac860bf19580f6a7067001491.jpg", "title": "W.Va. ferry transport for some, novelty for others", "description": "Twice a day, five days a week, for the better part of 18 years, Lori Jones has ridden the ferry across the Ohio River from Sistersville to Fly in the morning and back in the afternoon.", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf5b0\"", "article_summary": "The Sistersville ferry began operating 196 years ago and is the only commercial ferry still running in West Virginia, as well as the only one on the Ohio River north of Cincinnati.\nTyler is the only county in West Virginia on the Ohio River where there is no bridge spanning the river.\nThe fares generally pay for operation of the ferry, Peters said.\nJones and Karney typify the uses and users of the ferry: the local residents who use it as an extension of West Virginia 18 and the visitors who consider riding it a novelty.\nAbout an hour-and-a-half earlier, Ft.
