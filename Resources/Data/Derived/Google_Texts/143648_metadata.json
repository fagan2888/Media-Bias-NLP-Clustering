But 41 Democrats nonetheless voted for the defense bill that usually attracts a wide bipartisan coalition.\n\nMost of the Democrats who voted for it are vulnerable lawmakers who will be top GOP targets in the 2016 election cycle or serve on the House Armed Services Committee, which crafted the legislation.\n\nPelosi, though, said the defense authorization \"perpetuates instability\" and sets unrealistic funding for the Pentagon budget. She suggested the vote further demonstrated that a majority of Democrats could sustain a presidential veto of legislation adhering to the GOP budget framework.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"Democrats stand for a strong national defense, and today, our members sent a strong message in support of giving our men and women in uniform and our military overall the certainty they need, not Republican budget gimmicks,\" Pelosi said in a statement.\n\nTwo of the defecting Democrats, Reps. Tammy Duckworth (Ill.) and Patrick Murphy (Fla.), are running for Senate. A vote against the defense authorization could have risked attack ads accusing them of not supporting the military, especially in a statewide race compared with a district race.\n\nDuckworth is also an Iraq War veteran and serves on the Armed Services panel.\n\nIn an example of what those attacks ads could be like, Speaker John Boehner John BoehnerHouse GOP faces dilemma on spending bills Overnight Finance: Puerto Rico bill clears panel | IRS chief vows to finish term | Bill would require nominees to release tax returns Overnight Defense: Pentagon chief fears sequestration's return MORE (R-Ohio) accused the 143 Democrats who voted against the legislation of \"letting politics come before national security.\" Boehner John BoehnerHouse GOP faces dilemma on spending bills Overnight Finance: Puerto Rico bill clears panel | IRS chief vows to finish term | Bill would require nominees to release tax returns Overnight Defense: Pentagon chief fears sequestration's return MORE, however, has voted against the defense authorization twice - in 2009 and 2010.\n\n\"With all the threats our troops face and the sacrifices they make, Democrats\u2019 opposition to this defense bill is in fact indefensible,\" Boehner said in a statement.\n\nReps. Gwen Graham (Fla.), Brad Ashford (Neb.), Scott Peters (Calif.) and Pete Aguilar (Calif.) serve on the House Armed Services Committee and are among the most vulnerable Democrats heading into 2016.\n\n\"The government\u2019s first and foremost duty is to keep our nation safe. I\u2019m proud to support the National Defense Authorization Act, which will ensure our military remains the strongest on earth,\" Graham said in a statement.\n\nAll but one of the 27 Democrats serving on the Armed Services panel voted for the defense bill during the committee markup last month. Yet only 16 voted for it on the floor, showing the political wind had shifted.\n\nRep. Adam Smith Adam SmithGOP: Congress should study the draft before adding women Key Dem to oppose defense bill House panel kills LGBT effort on defense bill MORE (Wash.), the top Armed Services Democrat, voted against the defense authorization on the floor, citing the $38 billion for the war fund circumventing spending caps under sequestration.\n\nOther vulnerable Democrats like Reps.

By contrast, last year a majority of Democrats voted in favor: 109-85.\n\nThe defense authorization bill is one of the few annual bills that has continued to clear both chambers of Congress on time, now in its 53rd consecutive year.\n\nBelow is a list of the 41 Democrats who voted for the National Defense Authorization Act of 2016:\n\n1.
