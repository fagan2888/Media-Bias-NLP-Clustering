Many of these deaths have roots in preventable complications, such as hospital-acquired infections, blood clots and delirium due to oversedation. Hospitals have taken numerous steps to address avoidable ICU complications such as investing in more robust infection prevention programs. Now, however, the WSJ reports, some hospitals are testing an approach that incorporates years of medical data and records, many of which have never been analyzed together before.\n\nWhile simpler strategies such as checklists have helped ICUs reduce more predictable risks, less predictable hazards are a greater concern for healthcare providers, Kenneth Sands, chief quality officer and senior vice president at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, told the WSJ. Beth Israel, in collaboration with experts from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and information technology company Aptima Inc., is developing an initiative called Risky States, which uses big data to gauge an ICU's risk level.\n\nThe project team analyzed data from patients in Beth Israel's seven ICUs from 2012 to 2014 and found multiple scenarios that correlated with increased risk--the \"risky states\" of the program name--including higher numbers of sicker patients, a higher percentage of nurses with less than a year of experience and high patient-to-nurse ratios.\n\nThey next identified about 30 patient harms that occurred during or after the risky states, including medication errors, readmission to the ICU, bleeding and cardiac arrest. Beth Israel and its partners developed an application that pulls this data from electronic medical records automatically and gives clinicians the option to add any further concerns. Based on this information, the app tabulates an overall risk score in real time.\n\nBaltimore's Johns Hopkins Medicine is pursuing similar strategies through a program that compares current and historical patient data. To give all clinicians equal access to the same data and risk information, Hopkins needs better connectivity among its medical devices, Peter Pronovost, M.D., Ph.D., senior vice president for patient safety and quality, told the WSJ.\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- here's the article\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nInfection prevention for ICU patients extends lives, saves hospitals thousands\n\nMassachusetts regulates nurse staffing levels in ICUs\n\n5 health IT terms every hospital CEO must know\n\n3 lessons for big data success in healthcare\n\nBig data's burgeoning healthcare role causes increased legal, ethical concerns", "article_metadata": {"description": "Intensive care units, seeking to reduce avoidable deaths, can harness big data to identify trends that may increase patient risks, according to the Wall Street Journal.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "Intensive care units, seeking to reduce avoidable deaths, can harness big data to identify trends that may increase patient risks, according to the Wall Street Journal.", "title": "Hospitals turn to big data to identify risks in the ICU", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/how-big-data-can-identify-risks-icu/2015-06-29", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC),big data,Care Delivery,Dr. Peter Pronovost,Electronic Medical Records (EMRs),Health Information Technology,Intensive Care Unit,johns hopkins,Johns Hopkins Medicine,Patient Care & Outcomes,patient harm,patient harms,patient safety", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Care Delivery,Health Information Technology,Patient Care & Outcomes"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb498\"", "article_summary": "Baltimore's Johns Hopkins Medicine is pursuing similar strategies through a program that compares current and historical patient data.\nNow, however, the WSJ reports, some hospitals are testing an approach that incorporates years of medical data and records, many of which have never been analyzed together before.\nIntensive care units (ICUs), seeking to reduce avoidable deaths, can harness big data to identify trends that may increase patient risks, according to the Wall Street Journal.\nThey next identified about 30 patient harms that occurred during or after the risky states, including medication errors, readmission to the ICU, bleeding and cardiac arrest.\nHospitals have taken numerous steps to address avoidable ICU complications such as investing in more robust infection prevention programs."}
