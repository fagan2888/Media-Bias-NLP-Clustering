It seems our happiness is not based on how well things are going, but how much better they are than our expectations. Although the equation is insightful for all, it\u2019s what it may mean for the world of mental health that really has us buzzing.\n\nResearchers from University City London in the UK analyzed the relationship between happiness and reward, and took a look at the neural process that causes feelings of elation. In their study, 26 participants completed a decision-making task that could either end in willing or losing money. While completing the task, participants were repeatedly asked \u201chow happy are you right now,\u201d as a functional MRI measured their brain activity. From these results, the happiness equation was born, a rather complicated mathematical equation that can predict just how happy a person is.\n\nTo test their equation on a larger scale, researchers developed the smartphone app, The Great Brain Experiment. Over 18,000 participants worldwide played The Great Brain Experiment, and the happiness equation proved successful in correctly predicting the gamers' happiness levels.\n\nThe Happiness Equation.

The study\u2019s results revealed that expectations are just as an important factor in moment-to-moment happiness as recent rewards.\n\nThis means that while it still remains true that happiness can be achieved by having lower expectations. Ultimately, it was found that participants were happiest when they did better than expected during a risk-reward task, Time reported. This would make happiness largely dependent on the size of the gap between what we achieve and what we expect. As Professor Andrew Oswald, a behavioral economist at the University of Warwick told the BBC, \u201cIf you want to know how happy I am, don't ask me my salary. Ask me how my salary compares to other professors or to my own salary in the past.\u201d\n\nStill, having positive expectations about an event can also increase momentary happiness. For example, Rutledge explained that \u201cIf you have plans to meet a friend at your favourite restaurant, those positive expectations may increase your happiness as soon as you make the plan.\u201d\n\nMental Health\n\nSo what\u2019s going on in our brains to make us happy? On a subconscious level, our brains are constantly seeking rewards and satisfaction. When we make a decision, the brain is trying to figure out the best choice to lead it to a reward. All decisions, expectations, and outcomes are stored and then used to help us again make good choices in the future. \u201cAll of the recent expectations and rewards combine to determine your current state of happiness,\" Rutledge told the BBC.\n\nRutledge told Medical Daily that he believes that his study may be helpful in developing better treatments for individuals suffering from mental health conditions. \u201cWe're now testing people that suffer from depression and trying to see whether our equation can predict their happiness, and seeing if we can find something different about how they make decisions, or how they respond to rewards,\u201d he wrote. Being able to predict what will make an individual happy or not could help researchers better understand what triggers certain mood disorders, and \u201cwe may be able to help those people more,\u201d Rutledge said.\n\nSource: Rutledge RB, Skandali N, Dayan P, Dolan RJ.
