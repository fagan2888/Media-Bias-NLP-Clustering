McDonald, the secretary of Veterans Affairs, spoke with reporters on Thursday about changing the culture of an agency that is still trying to recover from the scandal over delays in care at V.A. hospitals that was uncovered in May. Since then, he said, wait times for doctor visits at the hospitals across the country have gone down.\n\nMr. McDonald said that at the department\u2019s medical center in Phoenix \u2014 where delays in care contributed to the deaths of several patients \u2014 wait times have gone down by as much as 37 percent. Using that and other figures, he hopes to show that change is coming.\n\n\u201cChanging culture is one of the most important things a leader can do, particularly coming out of a crisis situation,\u201d he said. \u201cWe know that the trust has been compromised. And we know that we\u2019re going to have to earn that back \u2014 one veteran at a time.\u201d\n\nThat was Mr. McDonald\u2019s goal when he developed the \u201cRoad to Veterans Day\u201d action plan that would address deep institutional deficiencies. The agency has extended clinic hours at facilities across the nation, sent out mobile units to constituents in places like Phoenix, and hired more doctors and nurses, all in an effort to accelerate patient access to care.\n\nMore than 1.2 million additional appointments have been scheduled in the past four months compared with the same period last year.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut some of the most significant changes are not about policy, they are about people.\n\nIn July, during a congressional hearing, Mr. McDonald gave out his cellphone number, which netted him about 250 calls a day from veterans and others. Those calls are now down to \u201cmaybe five to 10 a day,\u201d he said, but that is the sense of accountability that he says he wants to build.\n\nSince being sworn in, Mr. McDonald has visited 41 V.A. facilities, and he says that they are creating an environment that encourages whistle-blowing. The three employees in Phoenix who reported the problems this year have \u201cgood, new jobs,\u201d he said, refuting accusations of retaliation. Those who speak up will be protected and the wrongdoers aptly punished, he said.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t run one of the most admired companies in the world by being lax on disciplinary action,\u201d he said.\n\nBut there have not been the mass firings or institutional floggings that some had expected.\n\n\u201cCan a secretary come in and change the culture of the 300,000-person Department of Veterans Affairs, where often times worker protection is emphasized more than outcomes for vets?\u201d asked Pete Hegseth, the chief executive of Concerned Veterans for America.\n\nThere are 100 cases under investigation by federal agencies.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20141106205923, "twitter": {"description": "Robert A.
