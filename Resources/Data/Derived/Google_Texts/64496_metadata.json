I was suspicious of what I thought was a runner's cramp, and got lucky.\n\nEryn Vorn/flickr A glutton for good running weather, I could not resist the Thanksgiving weekend weather. It was pitch-perfect: cloudless, warm, a cool breeze. The month before I had run my fastest marathon: just under four hours at the 2012 Marine Corps Marathon. So, I should have been recovering with light, slow, shallow runs.\n\n\n\nBut several hours on a cramped five-hour flight the night before had me buzzing with pent-up energy. So, I ran. Probably too far, probably too fast.\n\n\n\nSitting at a table in Starbucks on Saturday, Sunday, and Monday, plugging away all day on a project, time slipped by. It felt good to focus, all that energy cleared from my metabolic cache. When I stood to go home Monday night, my calves immediately tightened. The pain in the right calf eased, but the pain in the left calf did not.\n\n\n\nI rested, iced, elevated the leg, and doubled up on liquids and bananas, but the pain did not subside. On Wednesday, I limped to work and trolled sports-medicine web pages. One web site after another said generally the same thing: A deep vein thrombosis (DVT), or blood clot, can closely resemble a leg cramp or a muscle tear. My stomach clenched.\n\n\n\nRecent long travel; a prolonged period of remaining in the same position; and red, painful, swelling were among the causes and symptoms listed. I had all but the redness and swelling. I called my doctor. She said to go to the nearest emergency room. I meant to sound as matter-of-fact when I told my boss why I was leaving early, but it came out more as a warble.\n\n\n\nThe emergency room\u2019s ultrasound technician\u2019s questions turned to silence as she tapped buttons on a keyboard and stared at the images on her screen, rarely looking up as she moved her wand over the clear jelly-like coating she\u2019d smeared on my leg. When she stepped out of the room, I peeked at the images on her computer screen. I saw blue and grey shapes and a small red mound, like an ant hill. I was poking my leg when the ER doctor came in. He told me to take my hand off of my leg and not to do that again. It\u2019s probably a muscle tear, the student doctor said. He came to prepare my history for the ER doctor. It would take a longer flight and longer period of immobility than a weekend at Starbucks to develop a DVT, he said. I was ready to believe him and would have, if it weren\u2019t for that little red mound.\n\n\n\nI was poking my leg to pinpoint the pain for the cheery nurse who\u2019d come to check my vitals, when the ER doctor came in. He told me to take my hand off of my leg and not to do that again. An estimated one in 1,000 Americans are diagnosed each year with a DVT, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The number of Americans with DVTs, including those undiagnosed, is estimated to be up to 600,000. As many as 100,000 deaths each year are directly or indirectly linked to a DVT.\n\nThough I have flown farther and sat still in coffeehouses for longer in the past, the doctor told me the blockage most likely was the result of my weekend sojourn in Starbucks, exacerbated by the flight. I might also have been a bit dehydrated from the travel and the run. Whatever my particular cocktail of factors, the effect was the same: Blocked, the blood built up along the walls of the vein, clotting. Similar to a crash on a highway, the clot slowed the blood that tried to snake around it. The blood piled onto the clot, making it bigger and the passageway narrower. A DVT is not usually life-threatening, by itself. But if part of the clot breaks loose and is thrown back into the bloodstream to travel freely, eventually it may lodge in a passageway too small for it, such as those found in the lungs. The result, a pulmonary embolism (PE), can kill you. More than one-third of DVT patients have PE\u2019s, according to the Surgeon General\u2019s Call to Action to Prevent Deep Vein Thrombosis and Pulmonary Embolism, issued in 2008. \u201cOften, the first symptom of DVT is a fatal PE,\u201d Dr. Elizabeth G. Nabel, director of the National Institutes of Health\u2019s Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute wrote in the report. DVT/PE is an underappreciated problem in our society, said Dr. Anthony Venbrux, professor of radiology and surgery and director of the vascular and interventional radiology division at the George Washington Medical Center, echoing the report\u2019s findings. \u201cWe tend to dismiss them, saying \u2018I\u2019ll take an ibuprofen or use a heating pad.\u2019 \u2018We,\u2019 meaning everyone, including physicians,\u201d Venbrux said. \u201cA classic example is a physician who was an athlete and didn\u2019t want to acknowledge that it was DVT in the upper extremity that he was experiencing.\u201d \"DVT diagnoses are easy to overlook because the signs and symptoms are often difficult to recognize. In many cases, there are no clinically apparent signs at all.\" Early diagnosis is the key to a positive outcome, and diagnosis is not difficult or painful. Now, completely noninvasively, we can rule in or rule out a DVT with 98 percent accuracy using a Doppler ultrasound, Venbrux said. \u201cIn the old days, we would have to inject contrast dye.\u201d Nonetheless, many DVTs are believed to slip through the cracks, dismissed or unrecognized.\n\n\u201cThe tragedy of these diseases is that their diagnosis is easy to overlook because the signs and symptoms are often diffuse and difficult to recognize. In many cases, there are no clinically apparent signs at all,\u201d Nabel said. As I quickly learned, the default treatment is to let nature takes it course, assisted by an intense, steady regimen of blood thinners, which rob the blood of its ability to stick to the little red mound, which my body would slowly absorb. The flip side was that my blood also could not stick together well enough to scab should I sustain a bleeding injury. Around that time, I also discovered ClotConnect.org, which held a wealth of understandable information on blood clots for patients and doctors. Beth Waldron, the program director of Clot Connect at the University of North Carolina Hemophilia and Thrombosis Center, herself had a DVT and two PEs in 2003. By her own account, Waldron thought she pulled a muscle in the gym. She went to the doctor and was prescribed muscle relaxers. When the pain continued, she tried to work through it until, walking up the stairs to the shower one day, she couldn\u2019t catch her breath. \u201cThe world went floaty,\u201d she said. Eventually, she was prescribed antibiotics for a respiratory infection, she said. But, after taking her antibiotics for five days, under the impression that this wasn\u2019t serious, Beth had a pulmonary embolism that \u201cwas off-the-chart painful,\u201d she said. At the hospital, they found a pulmonary embolism in each lung and a DVT from midcalf to her hip. She was in the hospital for nine days and because the doctors found that she has a genetic risk factor, she is now on blood thinners for life. \"Every DVT patient says 'I thought I turned my ankle or slept funny or pulled a muscle.' Almost every one of them tends to dismiss what it is.\" \u201cAbout half of those who develop [deep vein thrombosis/pulmonary embolism] have two things in common. First, they have one or more identifiable risk factors for the disease. Second, they experience some sort of triggering event, such as hospitalization, trauma, surgery, or a prolonged period of immobilization,\u201d the surgeon general\u2019s report said. The other half of cases are mostly unprovoked, or \u201csilent,\u201d producing \u201cfew, if any, symptoms,\u201d it said. In Venbrux\u2019s experience, a \u201cnormal patient is someone who comes in with pain and may or may not have swelling. Every one of them says, \u2018I thought I turned my ankle or slept funny or pulled a muscle. Almost every one of them tends to dismiss or blow off what it is. Almost everyone discounts it initially and then after the diagnosis comes to an awareness,\u201d he said, and noted that physician awareness is equally important.\n\nNowadays, blood clot surveillance in hospitals is a standard of practice that \u201cis on the tip of most people\u2019s tongue,\u201d according to Dr. Gregory Piazza, a Harvard Medical School instructor and a physician in the Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital\u2019s Cardiovascular Medicine division. This development is owed, in part, to reports and studies such as the surgeon general\u2019s report that found that hospitals often failed to identify and begin treating deep vein thrombosis/pulmonary embolism risk early. Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital uses a computerized decision support program to evaluate the risk of every patient in the hospital, Piazza said. The system uses electronic health records to look at risk factors and tabulates a score for each patient. For patients that are high risk, an electronic alert goes to the health care provider that comes up when admission orders are being written, along with a template of commonly used prophylactic measures, according to Piazza, who also is on the board of directors of the North American Thrombosis Forum. An electronic decision support system \u201cis not the norm quite yet,\u201d Piazza said. \u201cOthers use simple paper and pencil, and tabulate. The important thing is that immediately on admission you get the ball rolling,\u201d he said. By New Year\u2019s, I had read my way through most of the online literature about DVTs. Beyond the basics, the Internet was an information wasteland. My concern that I might develop a pulmonary embolism was shifting into anxiety about the road ahead if I made it through this. Running was not an option, but neither was sitting still, just worrying and waiting. Hunkered into big jackets weighed down by pockets filled with pills, granola bars, and apple juice, with a medic-alert bracelet clamped on, I spent the winter weekend afternoons on long, slow walks.\n\n\n\nAfter about three months, under the watchful eyes of the neighborhood YMCA\u2019s staff, I ventured into more rigorous activities. If I could manage to cause to bleed on a stationary recumbent bike, I probably deserved an award, I figured. Having read that exercising while on blood thinners might reduce the pain and swelling that sometimes follow a blood clot, it was my mission to become a gym rat.
