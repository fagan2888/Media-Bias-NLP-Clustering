The one thing that gave him pause was the thought of having to wait several hours next to a bunch of sick people.\n\nBut his wife, Jeannette, remembered she\u2019d seen Dignity Health television commercials featuring a woman sitting in a hospital waiting room and then cutting to the same woman sitting on her living room couch as words come up on the screen: \u201cWait for the ER from home.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been in emergency rooms before, so I thought I\u2019d see if this worked out,\u201d she said, and went online to book an appointment for her husband at Dignity\u2019s St. Mary\u2019s Medical Center in San Francisco.\n\n\u201cThey actually had an appointment that was within the hour. It was fast, it was convenient and there was also immediately confirmation we had the appointment,\u201d she said.\n\nDignity Health, which runs a large network of hospitals out of its San Francisco headquarters, also offers online ER booking at Saint Francis Memorial Hospital in San Francisco and Sequoia Hospital in Redwood City as a way to overcome the frequently grueling emergency room wait times.\n\nDignity isn\u2019t the only network employing the strategy. In an era of increased competition driven by the nation\u2019s Affordable Care Act, hospital executives around the country are hoping online appointments will attract patients eager to avoid long waits in a crowded and often chaotic environment.\n\n\u201cIt makes for a happier camper,\u201d said Susan Dubuque, a national expert in hospital marketing. \u201cWhen it comes to health care, consumers want more control over everything.\u201d\n\nNot for everyone\n\nEmergency room appointments are not intended for patients with serious emergencies \u2014 those with life-threatening, debilitating or urgent medical conditions.\n\nPatients with chest pain, persistent bleeding or trouble breathing, for instance, are instructed to call 911 or go directly to an emergency room. Those with an ankle sprain or a fever, for instance, might be able to make an appointment.\n\nAt UCSF Medical Center, patients must explain in an online form the reason for their visit and check a box indicating they can wait for treatment until their scheduled appointment. Even then, they may be bumped by more seriously ill patients, but in most cases they will be seen soon after arrival.\n\nThe approach makes business sense for hospitals because it lets medical staff know who may be coming through the emergency room door and helps reduce crowding and decrease wait times, hospital executives say. They say the service also helps build a loyal clientele among patients.\n\nPatients want to access health care the same way they do services in other industries, such as retail or travel, said Chris Song, a spokesman for InQuicker, a Nashville company that offers the online scheduling in California and 25 other states.\n\n\u201cWhen is the last time someone bought plane tickets at the gate?\u201d he said.\n\nUCSF Medical Center started using InQuicker in its emergency department in 2012 and expanded it a year later to its acute care clinic, where less-critical cases are handled on a same-day, walk-in basis. Now the system is also being used to book primary care appointments.\n\nUnder the former way of doing things, Eva Turner, assistant director of ambulatory services for UCSF\u2019s primary care department, said patients were often frustrated because they had no way of knowing in advance if same-day acute-care appointments were still available. \u201cBefore (InQuicker), patients would park their car, pay the garage fee only to find out we can\u2019t see them,\u201d she said.\n\nCritics weigh costs\n\nSome critics say the online check-in system may be convenient but is not necessarily cost-effective. It could encourage patients to seek care in the costliest of settings, emergency rooms, when they should be going to less-expensive urgent care centers or medical offices, they say.\n\nIf the country wants to decrease health care costs, patients need to be treated at the right place at the right time, said Del Morris, president of the California Academy of Family Physicians. Patients who can make appointments should do so at their doctors\u2019 offices, he said.\n\n\u201cThis sounds like it is the most expensive place,\u201d said Morris, medical director of the Stanislaus County Health Services Agency. \u201cEmergency rooms are there to take care of people who have emergencies.\u201d\n\nSan Ramon Regional Medical Center began using InQuicker in 2012 and sees about 33 patients a month through the service. Most are people who have sore throats, ear aches and stomach pains, said Sue Micheletti, the hospital\u2019s chief operating officer.\n\nOn the Web page where patients can select their time slot, they are given the option of looking for somewhere else for care: \u201cNot an Emergency? Locate an Urgent Care Center near you.\u201d\n\nPatients appreciate the convenience of knowing approximately when they will be seen \u2013 and avoiding the emergency room crunch times, she said. \u201cThat is worth a lot to them,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen it rains, it pours. Our emergency room sometimes gets slammed.\u201d\n\nLoma Linda University Medical Center in San Bernardino County, however, stopped using InQuicker after too many patients who hadn\u2019t made the appointments complained that others were walking in the door and being seen ahead of them.\n\nThe emergency room physicians liked it, but the nurses got tired of dealing with frustrated patients, said Kathleen Clem, chairwoman of the emergency medicine department.\n\nUnder the Affordable Care Act, however, Medicare reimbursements for hospitals are tied to results on patient surveys.\n\nDignity Health, which is also offering the online reservations at urgent care centers and doctors\u2019 offices, hopes that the new service will boost those patient satisfaction scores at the same time it minimizes wait times, said chief nursing officer, Page West.\n\n12,000 visits\n\nThe hospital network, which operates 39 medical centers in three states, began offering online reservations with InQuicker about a year ago. Since then, roughly 12,000 patients have scheduled visits for emergency rooms at hospitals in California, Arizona and Nevada, according to the company.\n\nBridget Duffy, chief medical officer at Vocera Communications in San Jose and an expert in the patient experience, said streamlining the emergency room experience for patients is necessary, but hospitals need do more.\n\nThey also need to assess patients quickly, improve communication with them and better manage their pain. Only then, she said, will hospitals be able to truly improve the patient experience.\n\nFor Scott Paul, the San Francisco patient, the emergency-room visit led to an appointment with a podiatrist a couple of days later, where he was fitted with a boot for a stress fracture. His only complaint is that everything happened so quickly he didn\u2019t get a chance to watch the U.S. play Portugal in that afternoon\u2019s World Cup game in the waiting room.\n\nHis wife had no such qualms: \u201cWe went to the emergency room and they said, \u2018We were expecting you.'\u201d\n\nThis story also ran in the San Francisco Chronicle.
