Paul LePage showed fellow Republican Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey around the neighborhood LePage grew up in as the two took a one-block walk in Little Canada.\n\nChristie, who was on his third trip to Maine in support of LePage\u2019s re-election campaign, said Maine\u2019s governor was the kind of guy who wouldn\u2019t forget where he came from.\n\n\u201cYou can tell by the way Paul talks about this place how special it is to him,\u201d Christie said of Lewiston. \u201cI think that gives a window for the people of Maine as to the kind of person he is and as to the kind of leader he is.\u201d\n\nLePage, in a tight three-way race against Maine\u2019s Democratic 2nd District U.S. Rep. Mike Michaud and independent Eliot Cutler, a Cape Elizabeth lawyer and businessman, said he was pleased and proud to have Christie\u2019s support.\n\nChristie, chairman of the Republican Governor\u2019s Association, said earlier this year the association planned to spend whatever it took to get LePage re-elected. Christie also said he would personally do everything he could to help LePage.\n\nChristie, whom many see as a possible Republican candidate for president in 2016, has been on a multi-state sweep stumping for Republican candidates for governor in Minnesota and Florida.\n\nOn Tuesday, Christie quipped that of all the states he\u2019s been to, besides New Jersey, Maine was his favorite.\n\nLePage and Christie have become friends, and the two men exchanged a warm embrace prior to the private fundraising event at the Ironhorse Court in Lewiston. However, they have made some different policy choices for their respective states.\n\nChristie is one of several Republican governors who agreed to expand their state\u2019s Medicaid program under the federal Affordable Care Act, a move LePage has resisted by five times vetoing bills that would have accepted federal funds to expand the program in Maine.\n\nOn Tuesday, Christie said LePage was doing what he thought was right for his state and that not all Republican governors were in lock-step on expansion.\n\nLePage also said for the first time since March 2013 that he was open to a limited expansion of the state\u2019s Medicaid program, known as MaineCare, but that he still opposed a massive enlargement of the program to sweep up between 70,000 to 100,000 more people.\n\nBecause the state had previously expanded Medicaid, prior to the Affordable Care Act, it was not eligible for 100 percent reimbursement for all the people his Democratic opponents would like to add to the program, a detail that\u2019s often overlooked by the media, LePage said.\n\n\u201cWe were the early expanders, and we did not qualify for 100 percent reimbursement for the entire expansion,\u201d LePage said. \u201cI\u2019ve said it until I\u2019m blue in the face.\u201d\n\nUnder the Affordable Care Act, states would receive 100 percent federal reimbursement for the cost of expanding their Medicaid programs for the first three years of the expansion, that rate is reduced to 90 percent over 10 years. But LePage has said those previously added to the state\u2019s Medicaid rolls prior to the Affordable Care Act would still only be reimbursed at 62 percent. It\u2019s a touchy subject for LePage\u2019s opponents who argue the governor\u2019s reluctance to expand the program is costing the state upwards of $1 million per day.\n\nOn Tuesday, Christie also praised LePage\u2019s record on job creation over his first four years and dismissed criticism that while Maine\u2019s unemployment rate had declined during LePage\u2019s first term, earnings, job creation and overall economic growth in the Pine Tree State still lagged behind the nation and most other New England states.\n\n\u201cThe governor wants more job creation as well,\u201d Christie said. \u201cBut remember the mess he inherited here in Maine. He had an enormous hole to dig out of, and that kind of problem is not going to be fixed in four years. It\u2019s going to take longer to do that.\u201d\n\nChristie said a LePage victory was important to the Republican Governor\u2019s Association because, \u201cWe feel like Paul has really set a great stage here, not only for the people of Maine but also a great example for New England, about what can be done with common sense conservative leadership.\u201d\n\nSo far, the Republican Governor\u2019s Association has spent more than $2 million in support of LePage\u2019s campaign and in opposition to Michaud\u2019s.\n\nLePage also gained a glowing and unexpected endorsement Tuesday. During a visit to Pioneer Plastics in Auburn earlier in the day, employee Dana Bonney, who worked with LePage in the 1990s at the former Wilner Wood Products in Norway, said LePage was \u201cthe best boss he ever had.\u201d\n\nLePage was touring the Auburn plant, which manufactures specialized counter tops and other laminates, because it had recently moved about 120 jobs from South Carolina to Maine. Getting slightly choked up, Bonney told reporters that LePage worked hard with management and employees to save the wood-products company. That effort eventually failed, but Bonney said LePage was \u201can honest man and a man of his word.\u201d\n\nBut not everybody in Lewiston-Auburn was happy to see LePage and Christie on Tuesday.\n\nJim Lysen, a volunteer with the Maine People\u2019s Alliance, a liberal advocacy organization, was among about a dozen people that stood protesting Christie\u2019s visit to Lewiston on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m out here,\u201d Lysen said. \u201cBecause people are dying, because we are not providing health care and it\u2019s ideological, and LePage admits it\u2019s ideological.\u201d\n\nLePage said he was \u201cwilling and ready to go to work\u201d to figure out a way to cover people who earned less than 100 percent of the federal poverty guideline \u2014 $11,670 per year for a single person. Those individuals are not covered and are ineligible for federal subsidies to purchase insurance on the federal health care exchange because of a flaw in the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cBut before I do that, I would like to make sure that our elderly who have been ignored, who have been subsidizing Medicaid, our disabled and our mentally ill who frequent our jails\u201d receive services, LePage said. \u201cThey get the services first before we take care of the able-bodied people, who are able to work by insuring them with Medicaid.\u201d\n\nLePage said his goal was to do \u201cexactly what the Democrats want to do artificially.\u201d\n\n\u201cI want to grow people\u2019s work skills so they earn enough money to be able to afford their own insurance rather than have the government buy it for them,\u201d LePage said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "LEWISTON, Maine \u2014 After a $100-per-plate luncheon Tuesday, Gov.
