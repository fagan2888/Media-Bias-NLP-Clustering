Mike Pence announces the approval of Hip 2.0, last year. Gretchen Frazee Gretchen Frazee\n\nINDIANAPOLIS -- House lawmakers Thursday approved a bill that would enshrine in state law Gov. Mike Pence\u2019s health care program for low-income Hoosiers, HIP 2.0.\n\nJust about one year ago, Pence, after months of negotiations with the federal government, announced the creation of HIP 2.0. Using money from the Affordable Care Act, it provides health insurance to low-income Hoosiers while allowing them to make payments into health savings accounts.\n\nMore than 370,000 Hoosiers use the program.\n\nAnd now, the Governor and GOP lawmakers want to codify the entire program, meaning to change any of it would require legislation in the future.\n\nRep. Ed DeLaney, D-Indianapolis, says there\u2019s something more important than embracing HIP 2.0 in law.\n\n\u201cPreserving the flexibility to everyone sitting in the Governor\u2019s office and their peers in Washington to work out a deal that works,\u201d DeLaney says.\n\nDeLaney wryly applauded his Republican colleagues for embracing the Affordable Care Act, or, as he put it, Obamacare.\n\n\u201cWhat putting this into statute does is protects the significant difference between HIP 2.0 and Obamacare,\u201d says Rep. Jerry Torr, R-Carmel.\n\nRepublicans argue HIP 2.0\u2019s health savings accounts promote more personal accountability than traditional Medicaid expansion through the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe House approved the measure 61-33, with four Republicans voting against it. It heads back to the Senate.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "HIP 2.0, Indiana House, Indiana legislature, Affordable Care Act", "pubdate": "2016-03-04", "author": "Brandon Smith", "og": {"site_name": "WFYI Public Media", "description": "Just about one year ago, Gov.
