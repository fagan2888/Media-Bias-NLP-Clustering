The halftime performance at Sunday’s AFC championship game will be The Fray, the Denver Broncos announced Friday.

The game between the Denver Broncos and the New England Patriots at Sports Authority Field at Mile High starts at 1 p.m. after a Thunderstorm skydive jump and a “Go Broncos” cheer led by alumni, the team said in a news release.

Honorary team captain Rod Smith will be on hand for the pregame coin toss, and Christian recording artist Leah Shafer of Parker will sing the national anthem.

At halftime, the Denver-based foursome of Isaac Slade on vocals and piano; Joe King on vocals and guitar; Dave Welsh on guitar; and Ben Wysocki on drums will perform their new single “Love Don’t Die.” The Fray’s new album, “Helios,” will be released Feb. 25.

The band performed the song on the Jimmy Kimmel show Wednesday.
