Oklahoma lawmakers are reportedly considering legislation that would protect students\u2019 privacy.\n\nBut this federal intrusion comes as no surprise whatsoever. Just as high school students have no right to complain when their parents are paying the bills. As education researcher Greg Forster memorably put it, \u201cwith the president implementing his new commode core program, now can we finally admit it\u2019s unrealistic to expect the federal government to keep its hands off schools?\u201d\n\nWashington, D.C., bureaucracies use federal funds to manipulate transportation priorities, pushing things like HOV lanes that some communities may not need or want. They use participation in medical welfare programs to control how doctors\u2019 offices bill their patients, actually preventing certain kinds of discounts for patients. Federal funds in every area come with strings attached.\n\nThanks to Oklahoma participating in the federal Medicaid family planning services waiver, Oklahoma state taxpayers now subsidize RU-486, vasectomies and tubal ligations for single able-bodied adults.\n\nWhat to do? Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick: \u201c(President Barack Obama) says he\u2019s going to withhold funding if schools do not follow the policy. Well, in Texas, he can keep his 30 pieces of silver. We will not yield to blackmail from the president of the United States.\u201d\n\nTransgender bathrooms or not, refusing federal funds could sometimes be the prudent course. In 2013 Ed Allen, president of the Oklahoma City chapter of the American Federation for Teachers, said the Oklahoma City school district should \u201cturn down some federal money.\u201d As The Oklahoman editorial board pointed out: \u201cAllen noted federal grants often required implementing new programs or initiatives that take teachers away from classroom duties. In a district where 75 to 100 teaching positions are routinely vacant, accepting federal funds therefore made a bad staffing problem worse.\u201d\n\nOklahoma has been wise in some areas. Refusing to create an Obamacare exchange (we would have wasted half a billion) has now been validated. Remember they were decried for passing on the \u201cfree money.\u201d Oklahoma lawmakers have repeatedly rejected any forms of Obamacare\u2019s Medicaid expansion, including the latest scheme to pass a 145-percent tax increase on Oklahomans to usher in Obamacare\u2019s Medicaid expansion.\n\nOnce you get tangled in the federal government\u2019s strings, they generally always win.\n\nJonathan Small serves as president of the Oklahoma Council of Public Affairs (www.ocpathink.org).", "article_metadata": {"description": "Transgender bathrooms or not, refusing federal funds could sometimes be the prudent course.", "generator": "WordPress", "author": "Jonathan Small", "og": {"site_name": "The Journal Record", "description": "Transgender bathrooms or not, refusing federal funds could sometimes be the prudent course.", "title": "Free Market Friday: Federal strings", "url": "http://journalrecord.com/2016/05/19/free-market-friday-federal-strings-opinion/", "image": "http://journalrecord.com/files/2016/01/Small-Jonathan-WEB1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Free Market Friday: Federal stringsThe Journal Record", "msvalidate.01": "118D5E2D5722A6F1A827250C4D8CEC95", "keywords": "free market friday,jonathan small,obama administration", "google-site-verification": "vAy42WJoFK0to-yBz3axT36JMlFa0BIJdchVGi9IPXw", "y_key": "b211670718d8bd21", "thumbnail": "http://journalrecord.com/files/2016/01/Small-Jonathan-WEB1-180x120.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdeb38\"", "article_summary": "Federal funds in every area come with strings attached.\nIn a district where 75 to 100 teaching positions are routinely vacant, accepting federal funds therefore made a bad staffing problem worse.\u201dOklahoma has been wise in some areas.\nOnce you get tangled in the federal government\u2019s strings, they generally always win.\nThanks to Oklahoma participating in the federal Medicaid family planning services waiver, Oklahoma state taxpayers now subsidize RU-486, vasectomies and tubal ligations for single able-bodied adults.\nWe will not yield to blackmail from the president of the United States.\u201dTransgender bathrooms or not, refusing federal funds could sometimes be the prudent course."}
