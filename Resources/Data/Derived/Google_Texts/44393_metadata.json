That compares to a profit of $4.89 billion a year earlier. On a per share basis, the bank earned $1.45, compared with $1.28 a year earlier.\n\nThe average estimate of financial analysts surveyed by FactSet was $1.39 per share, which typically exclude one-time items. Net revenue at the bank was $24.01 billion, compared with $23.22 billion in the same period a year earlier.\n\nWall street analysts widely expected banks to report higher trading revenue this quarter, and JPMorgan met that expectation. Net revenue at the bank\u2019s corporate and investment bank rose 8 percent to $9.58 billion, helped by volatility in currency and fixed income markets.
