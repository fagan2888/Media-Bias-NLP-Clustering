A $400 increase, assuming you didn't have some terrible healthcare event, which it doesn't sound like you did, Clinton said at a campaign event in Virginia. I don't understand. The voter told Clinton that her health insurance plan had a rigid income cut-off that was preventing her from qualifying for subsidies. I have seen our health insurance for my own family go up $500 a month in the last two years, the voter said. We went from $400-something to $900-something \u2026 we're just fighting to keep benefits for ourselves. The woman said that she was also finding it difficult to provide benefits for her employees. The thought of being able to provide benefits to your employees is almost secondary. Yet, to keep your employees happy, that's a question that comes across my desk all the time, she said.\n\nHillary Clinton, Obama, obama administration, Obamacare, Jenna Lifhits\n\nhttp://cdn.weeklystandard.biz/cache/280x280-f78f7c08f5b903e4a7d4eff8645f4296.jpg", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Hillary Clinton,Obama,obama administration,Obamacare,Jenna Lifhits", "og": {"site_name": "Weekly Standard", "description": "Hillary Clinton was stunned Monday when a small business owner told her that the cost of her health insurance had increased nearly two fold.\nA $400 increase, assuming you didn't have some terrible healthcare event, which it doesn't sound like you did, Clinton said at a campaign event in Virginia.
