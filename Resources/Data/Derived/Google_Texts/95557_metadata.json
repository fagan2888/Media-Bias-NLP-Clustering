This was echoed in recent realities, the major chaos that first hit the Obamacare website, the continuing chaoes in veteran payment delays, the best laid plans of Government failing and failing badly.\n\nBecause there was no reason why an economic plan laid out by a superhero would have any better chance of working than one laid out by an economist. And in Jupiter\u2019s Legacy we see the real life implications of ideological solutions that fail to account for people doing what people always do.\n\nAs ever, its the details that make Jupiter\u2019s Legacy something special. Frank Quitely taking the extremity approach of Tex Avery for different panels, showing the extreme point of an action, frozen in space, when missing a goal. Or his multiple poses of one person in a panel used so expertly in All Star Superman is almost hidden in the background but vital to the story and rewarding the careful reader. You can see it in tomorrow\u2019s BBC documentary as well.\n\nSo yes, it\u2019s familiar, but that\u2019s not altogether a bad thing. It comforts, it envelops, it rewards and it entertains. And that\u2019s not the only Millarworld book doing that today.\n\nStarlight #1 starts at the end. The end of Flash Gordon, the end of Star Wars, when the heroes get the medals. And our hero is uncomfortable doing so. Straight away this is a story about what happens after the end of the movie, the comic, the traditional tale. It begins with the epilogue, with a sequel very unlikely.\n\nSo, yes, it\u2019s Incredibles, but it\u2019s also Dare. Probably more than it is Dark Knight Returns, frankly. The washed out hero, trying to recapture the good old days decades in in a world, a galaxy, that has moved on. And he\u2019s left on the shelf, redundant. But the tone is also closer to the Jack Nicholson film, About Schmidt, or Red. There is loss here. Someone who has done the amazing, the impossible, faced with the impossibly mundane. And dreaming about what once was, a galaxy away, with no way to get back.\n\nAnd yes, of course there\u2019s going to be a way to get back. Duke gets his sequel after all. Even if he\u2019s been trapped in development hell for a good long time.\n\nGorlan Porlav shows us two worlds, the majestically impossible and the grind numbingly mundane with ease, the distance only a gutter away but a whole galaxy in style and approach. You can see why Duke wants to get back so badly.\n\nBut there may have been other ways to do so. With these issues, we also get to see what binds Starlight and Jupiter\u2019s Legacy together, a system of portals, and some rather familiar looking alien priests. Looks like it wasn\u2019t just Duke McQueen doing the interdimensional travelling\u2026\n\nMillarworld \u2013 or Millarworlds \u2013 begin here.", "article_metadata": {"description": "When promotional images were first released, we noticed some similarities between the images seen in Starlight #1, out this week, and Pixar's movie The Inc", "og": {"site_name": "Bleeding Cool Comic Book, Movie, TV News", "description": "When promotional images were first released, we noticed some similarities between the images seen in Starlight #1, out this week, and Pixar's movie The Inc", "title": "Reading Starlight #1 And Jupiter's Legacy #4 - And Realising Just How Much Mark Millar Likes The Incredibles - Bleeding Cool Comic Book, Movie, TV News", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.bleedingcool.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/RocketMan-3-html-31327.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-03-03T10:30:36+00:00", "url": "http://www.bleedingcool.com/2014/03/03/reading-starlight-1-and-jupiters-legacy-4-and-realising-just-how-much-mark-millar-likes-the-incredibles/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Bleeding Cool Comic Book, Movie, TV News", "description": "When promotional images were first released, we noticed some similarities between the images seen in Starlight #1, out this week, and Pixar's movie The Inc", "title": "Reading Starlight #1 And Jupiter's Legacy #4 - And Realising Just How Much Mark Millar Likes The Incredibles - Bleeding Cool Comic Book, Movie, TV News", "image": "http://cdn.bleedingcool.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/RocketMan-3-html-31327.jpg", "creator": "@richjohnston", "site": "@bleedingcool", "card": "summary"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f01d4f", "fb": {"admins": 100000448608664}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://cdn.bleedingcool.net/wp-content/themes/bleeding-cool-theme-hub-async/library/images/win8-tile-icon.png", "google-site-verification": "xC4QJeYDnVm58lbkOY8Dc1DRQOLe0l7UTTDF5kl90fA", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/bleedingcoolnews", "section": "Comics", "tag": "starlight", "published_time": "2014-03-03T10:58:45+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-03-03T10:30:36+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "comics, entertainment, frank quitely, gorlan parlov, image, image comics, jupiter's legacy, mark millar, starlight, film"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe115d\"", "article_summary": "Well now we\u2019ve also read Jupiter\u2019s Legacy #4 as well, and boy howdy.\nAs ever, its the details that make Jupiter\u2019s Legacy something special.\nIndeed, Jupiter\u2019s Legacy seems to be looking at the limits of government.\nAnd in Jupiter\u2019s Legacy we see the real life implications of ideological solutions that fail to account for people doing what people always do.\nWith these issues, we also get to see what binds Starlight and Jupiter\u2019s Legacy together, a system of portals, and some rather familiar looking alien priests."}
