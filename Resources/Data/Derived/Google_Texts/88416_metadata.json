So far they\u2019ve floated the ideas of a ten year moratorium on Godparents and a ban on feast day processions. The problem they find is that the use of \u2018religious symbols\u2019 or \u2018even sacraments\u2019 allows these Mafia to \u2018present a 'clean' face to society\u2019 when of course they don\u2019t really have clean faces.\n\n**********************************************************************\n\nWhile around the world in formerly peaceful western countries, Muslims are violently protesting Israel\u2019s retaliation for the continuous rocket fire they get from Gaza Palestinians; one such protest occurred in Miami, Florida on Tuesday. Miami is the historic center of one of the largest Jewish population in the U.S. Muslim protesters yelled, \u201cWe are Hamas,\u201d which an official terrorist organization, and called for \u2018Jihad\u2019 or holy war against infidels right on N.
