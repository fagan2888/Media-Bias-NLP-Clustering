Shortly after, the site was renamed \"Good Part of Town.\" Its creator, who would only identify himself as a 30-something-year-old in Tallahassee, told Gawker: \"This was originally seriously developed as a travel tool and the name 'Ghetto Tracker' was meant to be something that people would remember.\" The basic premise of Ghetto Tracker/Good Part of Town -- to crowdsource travel advice \u2013 actually isn\u2019t so outrageous, but the framing, even without the word \"Ghetto\" in the name, and the intention -- to label whole geographic areas as \"good\" or \"bad,\" \"safe\" and \"unsafe\" -- make the operation distasteful. When does technology step over that line from being merely useful to becoming insidiously stereotype-enforcing? Yet in the growing field of geo-web applications, incorporating safety judgments into navigational aids is becoming increasingly common. Accusations of reinforcing racist or classist stereotypes could be lobbed at any of those apps. \"In any form,\" writes Emily Badger at The Atlantic Cities, \"this idea toes a touchy line between a utilitarian application of open data and a sly wink toward people who just want to steer clear of 'those kinds of neighborhoods.'\" So how should we think about these apps? When does technology step over that line from being merely useful to becoming insidiously stereotype-enforcing?\n\nAnyone can investigate a neighborhood by looking up local crime rates, median income, and demographics online \u2013 not to mention the information gleaned from word-of-mouth reports. To perform such research and then make a decision about traveling to a particular area involves critical thinking, which is hardly objectionable. The ethical problem occurs when your mobile device takes over that thinking for you. Microsoft\u2019s Pedestrian Route Production technology, patented in January 2012 \u2013 and immediately dubbed \"the avoid-ghetto app\" by many in the media -- was designed to one day let Windows Phone users filter walking routes according to \"weather information, crime statistics, [and] demographic information.\" According to the language of the patent, such filtering is useful because \"if it is relatively cold outside, then a pedestrian is far more likely to feel an impact then [sic] if a vehicle equipped with a heating system protected her. Moreover, it can be more dangerous for a pedestrian to enter an unsafe neighborhood then [sic] a person in a vehicle since a pedestrian is more exposed and it is more difficult for her to leave an unsafe neighborhood quickly.\" It makes sense to keep safety in mind while navigating an unfamiliar area on foot, but letting a computer algorithm divert you from a particular neighborhood on account of statistics is problematic. There\u2019s another feature mentioned in the Microsoft patent that deserves scrutiny: the ability to sell route directions. Corporations could pay to have the app send users through routes with carefully plotted advertising campaigns. If your GPS system directed you to turn down one street rather than a parallel one just so you\u2019d encounter a specific poster, would it do so with your consent? We know how and why the USPS carries our mail. Private corporations are often not as transparent. Jim Thatcher, a geographer at Clark University, says our increasing reliance on mobile spatial technologies opens the door for something he calls \"teleological redlining,\" in which applications \"make it very easy to malign certain areas\" and can even \"obliterate\" the possibility of our encountering certain people, places, and events. What\u2019s more, these applications are generally presented to us as \"neutral.\" We often forget to consider the motivations and biases at work behind the scenes.", "article_metadata": {"description": "When it comes to navigational apps, where&#39;s the line between utility and racism?", "author": "Svati Kirsten Narula", "og": {"site_name": "The Atlantic", "description": "When it comes to navigational apps, where&#39;s the line between utility and racism?", "title": "The Real Problem With a Service Called 'Ghetto Tracker'", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2013/09/ku-bigpic/lead_large.png", "url": "http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/09/the-real-problem-with-a-service-called-ghetto-tracker/279403/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "theatlantic.com", "site": "@theatlantic", "card": "summary"}, "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "p": {"domain_verify": "68e1a0361a557708fefc992f3309ed70"}, "fb": {"admins": "577048155,17301937", "page_id": 29259828486, "app_id": 100770816677686}, "keywords": "The Atlantic, The Atlantic Magazine, TheAtlantic.com, Atlantic, news, opinion, breaking news, analysis, commentary, business, politics, culture, international, science, technology, national and life", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, width=device-width, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe168b\"", "article_summary": "A screenshot of the Ghetto Tracker homepage (GhettoTracker.com via Gawker) A service called \"Ghetto Tracker\" appeared online at the beginning of this week and quickly drew criticism for its racist and classist overtones.\nIts creator, who would only identify himself as a 30-something-year-old in Tallahassee, told Gawker: \"This was originally seriously developed as a travel tool and the name 'Ghetto Tracker' was meant to be something that people would remember.\"\nMoreover, it can be more dangerous for a pedestrian to enter an unsafe neighborhood then [sic] a person in a vehicle since a pedestrian is more exposed and it is more difficult for her to leave an unsafe neighborhood quickly.\"\nYet in the growing field of geo-web applications, incorporating safety judgments into navigational aids is becoming increasingly common.\nWhen does technology step over that line from being merely useful to becoming insidiously stereotype-enforcing?"}
