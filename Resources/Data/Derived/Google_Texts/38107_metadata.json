That meant those species could not be imported or taken across state lines.\n\nThat didn't stop the nightmare in the Everglades, where Burmese pythons \u2014 which can grow to 18 feet and weight 150 pounds \u2014 already are breeding and spreading. Rabbits, raccoons, opossums, bobcats and foxes, which once were common in the Everglades, now are rarely seen. Though it's impossible to definitively blame the pythons, the conclusion is a logical one.\n\nAstoundingly, the United States Association of Reptile Keepers sued to overturn that watered-down ban, saying it would cripple a $100 million industry in sales of constricting snakes. The outcome of that suit is pending.\n\nNow, the Fish and Wildlife Service is again considering a ban on five snakes omitted from the 2012 decision \u2014 including the boa constrictor, green anaconda, Beni anaconda, deSchauensee's anaconda and reticulated python. The green anaconda, the largest snake in the world, already has been seen in the Everglades. The boa constructor is established in Miami-Dade County.\n\nThose in the snake trade offer a weak argument that cold weather will restrict the giant snakes to South Florida. But a recent survey showed that mangroves, which are cold-sensitive plants, are moving up Florida's coast as the climate warms. Is it unreasonable to expect that snakes would do the same?\n\nThe public comment period for the proposed ban ends July 24. To add your voice, go to\n\nfederalregister.gov/a/2014-14712.\n\nThis foolishness of importing such dangerous species has to stop.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://newspr.es/1m1zuT2", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "The green anaconda, the largest snake in the world, already has been seen in the Everglades.", "og": {"site_name": "The News-Press", "description": "The green anaconda, the largest snake in the world, already has been seen in the Everglades.", "title": "Dumping snakes into the Everglades has to stop", "url": "http://www.news-press.com/story/opinion/2014/07/05/dumping-snakes-everglades-stop/12233423/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/news-press.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The green anaconda, the largest snake in the world, already has been seen in the Everglades.", "title": "Dumping snakes into the Everglades has to stop", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/bacee1afa817cff808c8ef95cfc00b91f417e357/c=525-0-2672-2147&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/FortMyers/2014/07/04/fnptab06-15-2014tropnorth1e01420140610img002.jpg11pv7jddhal431.jpg", "creator": "@thenewspress", "site": "@thenewspress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600073397", "fb": {"app_id": 149631068421067}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc3e5\"", "article_summary": "That didn't stop the nightmare in the Everglades, where Burmese pythons \u2014 which can grow to 18 feet and weight 150 pounds \u2014 already are breeding and spreading.\nFobb is one of 7 licensed snake experts allowed to stalk and kill the pythons that are overtaking the everglades.\nBuy Photo A wild Burmese python caught on private lands by snake hunter Jeff Fobb is displayed.\nA wild burmese python caught on private lands by snake hunter Jeff Fobb is displayed.\nThose in the snake trade offer a weak argument that cold weather will restrict the giant snakes to South Florida."}
