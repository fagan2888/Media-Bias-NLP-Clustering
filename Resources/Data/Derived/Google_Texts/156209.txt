Oklahoma City's Animal Shelter joins 49 other shelters across the U.S. to compete in the Rachel Ray 100K Challenge, a competition to increase adoption rates at animal shelters nationwide.

A total of $600,000 in grants is at stake for shelters that adopt more animals in June, July and August than they did over the same three-month period in 2013.

"Our goal is to adopt more than 2,300 dogs and cats between June 1 and August 3," acting Animal Welfare Superintendent Jon Gary said. "We are committed to reaching this goal and saving as many pet lives as possible.

To kick off the campaign, the Oklahoma City Animal Shelter will host a 24-hour "Rock around the Clock" adoption event that begins at midnight on June 6 and ends at midnight on June 7 at McDonalds, located at NW Expressway and Council.

During the event, adoption fees for kittens will be $30, and cats are free. Dogs and puppies can be adopted for $60. The Bella Foundation will be onsite microchipping adopted animals for $10. PetSmart is giving away adoption packets with coupons and specials, and McDonalds will have food specials. All adoptable dogs and cats are sterilized, vaccinated and treated for fleas and ticks.

The City's campaign theme is "Come adopt a rock star," and the slogan is "2,300 adoptions, 92 days, 1 city."

The organization that does the best job will win $25,000, and the division winner will be eligible for between $10,000 and $25,000 in additional grants.

The event runs from June 1 to August 31 sponsored by the ASPCA.

The Oklahoma City Animal Shelter is open for adoptions from noon to 5:45 p.m. every day except holidays at S.E. 29th and Bryant, 1.5 miles east of Interstate 35.
