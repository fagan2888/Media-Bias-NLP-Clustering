While Bonhams won't give an estimate, Ferrari experts and collectors said it's likely to fetch well over $35 million and could even top $50 million. That would top the current record holder\u2014a Mercedes-Benz W196R racer that was sold by Bonhams last July for $31.6 million including auction fees.\n\nRelated: The 10 Safest Small Cars and SUVs in America\n\nFerrari GTO's are now in a class by themselves in the car collecting world. Prized by super-rich collectors for their racing history and rarity (Ferrari made only 36), prices for top GTOs have soared from under $10 million in 2000 to over $50 million today. While a GTO recently traded for $52 million in a private sale, there hasn't been a GTO offered at a public auction in well over a decade.\n\n\"This quite likely will become the most expensive car at auction,\" said Marcel Massini, the Switzerland-based Ferrari historian and collecting advisor. \"The market right now is just so strong.\"\n\nBonhams looks set to break that record again. The GTO it's selling was the 19th made by Ferrari and it was delivered in 1962 to a French racing driver, Jo Schlesser. The car came in second in the 1962 Tour de France.\n\nBut the car crashed during a race at Montlh\u00e9ry, near Paris, in October 1962, killing the driver Henri Oreiller. Many GTOs have crashed, been repaired and sold for sky-high prices. But the Schlesser GTO is believed to be the only GTO to be involved in a fatal crash, which could affect the price.\n\n\"We have to be realistic,\" Messini said. \"That accident could turn some people off. But others may not care, because how many times are you going to be able to purchase a GTO with such a long ownership history.\"\n\nThat long ownership history started with Fabrizio Violati\u2014an Italian car buff and heir to his family's mineral water business. He bought the GTO in 1965, after it had been repaired by Ferrari and had raced it in European mountain-climb events. Violati raced the car in classic-car events throughout Europe until the 2000s and made it one of the centerpieces of his famed Ferrari museum\u2014known as the Maranello Rosso Collection\u2014in San Marino.\n\nRelated: The Race to Win in the $50B Connected Car Market\n\nViolati passed away in 2010 and his family recently sold the collection to a group of investors for more than $100 million, according to people familiar with the deal. Those investors are now selling the GTO along with the 32 other Ferraris through Bonhams over the course of the year.\n\nSince the GTO was with a well-known single owner for 49 years\u2014the longest of any GTO\u2014it has added value to collectors, Massini said.\n\nBonhams will sell the GTO along with nine other Maranello Rosso Ferraris on Aug. 14 at the Bonhams Quail Lodge Auction.\n\nThis article originally appeared in CNBC.\n\n\n\nRead more at CNBC:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "One of the Holy Grails of the car collecting world is about to come up for auction\u2014and", "title": "The Ferrari GTO That May Top $35 Million at Auction", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/07/07/Ferrari-GTO-May-Top-35-Million-Auction", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/Ferrari-250-GTO-Berlinetta-Credit-Bonhams.jpeg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/07/07/Ferrari-GTO-May-Top-35-Million-Auction", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/Ferrari-250-GTO-Berlinetta-Credit-Bonhams.jpeg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "One of the Holy Grails of the car collecting world is about to come up for auction\u2014and", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdcd03\"", "article_summary": "While Bonhams won't give an estimate, Ferrari experts and collectors said it's likely to fetch well over $35 million and could even top $50 million.\nA 1962 Ferrari 250 GTO will be put up for auction by Bonhams in August, as part of the events surrounding the Pebble Beach Concourse d'Elegance.\nWhile a GTO recently traded for $52 million in a private sale, there hasn't been a GTO offered at a public auction in well over a decade.\nThat would top the current record holder\u2014a Mercedes-Benz W196R racer that was sold by Bonhams last July for $31.6 million including auction fees.\n\"This quite likely will become the most expensive car at auction,\" said Marcel Massini, the Switzerland-based Ferrari historian and collecting advisor."}
