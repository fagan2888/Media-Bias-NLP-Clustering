To their self-employed workforces, they offer the prospect of making a lot of money. Also, people work when they want; they are free to play hooky or go to their daughter\u2019s soccer game.\n\nLast May, Uber Technologies said on its blog the median income for UberX drivers was more than $74,000 a year in San Francisco. That figure attracted a lot of attention, though it turned out to be unsustainable.\n\nUber\u2019s no longer making those lofty claims \u2014 a more recent study commissioned by Uber reported that the typical Uber X and Uber Black drivers make about $19 an hour after paying Uber\u2019s 20 percent commission (you would have to work about 80 hours a week to make $74,000 at that rate) \u2014 yet that hasn\u2019t diminished the appeal of driving for Uber. The company said that, as of December, it had more than 160,000 drivers in the United States who drive at least four times a month.\n\nSo why not you, too? Before taking the plunge, let\u2019s think about your prospects the way a small-business owner would.\n\nTo get started, you\u2019ll need a fairly new car, a driver\u2019s license and clean driving record, and an iPhone to access Uber\u2019s app that connects you with riders (if you don\u2019t have an iPhone, you can pay Uber $10 a week to rent one).\n\nYou\u2019ll also need insurance. Check with your insurance company to make sure your policy covers you when you\u2019re using your car for commercial purposes rather than just for personal use, because it probably doesn\u2019t. If your provider does offer a hybrid personal/commercial coverage, your premium for personal coverage will likely go up when you tell your agent you\u2019re driving for Uber.\n\nTaxes are another thing to pay attention to. A lot of attention.\n\nRemember, you don\u2019t work for Uber. You\u2019re a self-employed independent contractor. Instead of receiving a W2, you\u2019ll receive a 1099-MISC form that reports the gross income you made providing services to Uber. Uber won\u2019t have withheld any taxes from your paychecks, and you\u2019ll be responsible for paying the full federal and state income taxes.\n\nTo show how being an independent contractor differs from being an employee, let\u2019s assume you made $62,500 in fares and, after paying Uber $12,500 for its 20 percent commission, you\u2019re left with $50,000.\n\nFiguring out how much you owe to the IRS shouldn\u2019t be difficult. Many independent contractors set aside enough to cover their taxes due, just as would happen automatically if they were working for someone else.\n\nBy law, when you\u2019re self-employed, and if you owe at least $1,000 in taxes, you\u2019re supposed to pay your estimated taxes to the IRS each quarter and not wait until you file an annual return. If you don\u2019t do this because you incorrectly thought that you didn\u2019t owe taxes until April 15, you may have to pay the IRS a tax underpayment penalty.\n\nCalculating income\n\nTo estimate your taxes due, you have to first estimate your income.\n\nYou figure out your net business income by subtracting your business expenses from your business income. As an independent contractor, you\u2019re responsible for all of the expenses that arise when using your car: gas, insurance, fees, repairs, depreciation, etc.\n\nThe IRS allows you to deduct these expenses. You can do this either by deducting the actual expenses of operating your car or you can take the standard mileage rate, which is 56 cents for each business mile driven. If you do this, you can also deduct your parking fees and tolls. If you decide to use actual expenses, then you calculate the business portion of your expenses. Both of these amounts go on Schedule C, which is where you calculate net profit from your business.\n\nCalculating the tax bill\n\nOnce you calculate your net self-employment income, you can figure out how much you owe the IRS.\n\nAs an independent contractor, in addition to your income tax, you\u2019re responsible for paying taxes that your employer would otherwise pay for you, namely Social Security and Medicare taxes that you owe under the Self-Employment Contributions Act, or SECA. Because you\u2019re self-employed you\u2019ll be able to deduct half of the Social Security and Medicare tax.\n\nNow, assuming you earn all your income from Uber and you\u2019re single with no kids, let\u2019s figure out what your tax burden might be.\n\nOne outlier here is tips. Uber has a policy that passengers don\u2019t need to tip drivers for any of their services. (Uber Taxi gives riders the option to add a tip to the credit card.) UberX passengers who wish to tip their drivers can do so in cash. Drivers, in turn, would be expected to include tips as part of their taxable self-employment income.\n\nSuppose you net $50,000 in fares after paying Uber\u2019s commission and that the wear and tear on your car and other expenses give you a $10,000 deduction, giving you $40,000 in net self-employment income. You\u2019ll pay 15.3 percent SECA tax on 92.35 percent of this amount, or about $5,652. This amount goes on your federal 1040 income tax return.\n\nYou are allowed to deduct what is essentially the employer share of the payroll taxes. After doing this and taking the standard deduction and exemption, your taxable income is about $27,000, putting you in the 15 percent marginal tax bracket. You look up the tax tables and calculate that you\u2019ll owe about $3,600 in federal income tax, or about 13 percent of your income.\n\nThat\u2019s not all. There\u2019s one other potential \u201ctax\u201d that\u2019s new for tax year 2014: a fee for health insurance. If you don\u2019t have the minimal essential coverage, as required under the Affordable Care Act, then you have to pay the greater of $95 or 1 percent of your income. At your income level, you\u2019ll owe about $300. (You can figure out how much you owe by using the Tax Policy Center\u2019s ACA penalty tax calculator.)\n\nAdd the federal income, SECA taxes and ACA fee together, and you\u2019ll owe about $9,500 in taxes, or 25 percent of your net earnings.\n\nBy now, you\u2019ve probably realized there can be a big difference between the fares from driving for Uber, say $62,000, and what\u2019s left over after paying Uber\u2019s commission, your gas, car maintenance, health and car insurance expenses, and your federal income and self-employment taxes, or about $27,600. And you may still have to pay state and local income taxes, which might add up to another thousand dollars or so.\n\nKeep in mind: no benefits\n\nNo, you don\u2019t get fringe benefits as an independent contractor. No paid sick leave or vacation days, no subsidized health insurance or free coffee or snacks in the company cafeteria. No employer matching contributions to your 401(k) savings plan. No educational assistance, group term life insurance, health savings accounts and so forth.\n\nThings would be different if you worked for Uber Technologies. You would receive a 401(k) plan, gym reimbursement, nine paid company holidays, full medical/dental/visions package and an unlimited vacation policy. You might even get snacks in Uber\u2019s lunchroom.\n\nBecause the value of most of these fringe benefits isn\u2019t included in your taxable income, you don\u2019t have to pay taxes on them. Thus, they\u2019re really good for your bottom line.\n\nDespite all of this, you may still decide you would like to be your own boss and make extra cash in your spare time (According to Uber, more than half of its drivers work fewer than 16 hours a week).\n\nBut, as you consider your employment options, it\u2019s worthwhile to keep in mind the \u201cindependent contractor\u201d business model may not be as attractive as it may first appear.\n\n\u2014 Weiner teaches economics at George Washington University.
