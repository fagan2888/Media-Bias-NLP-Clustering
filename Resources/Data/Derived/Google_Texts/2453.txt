Topics: Louis C.K., Racism, Saturday Night Live, Video, Entertainment News

As was the case on his previous appearance, Louis C.K. seemingly used his monologue to test out new material — and as before, it was quite good, in particular his bit about growing up in the 1970s.

“I was born in 1967, so I grew up in the ’70s,” he said. “So I’m not racist — but I do have ‘mild racism.'”

“It was a very racist decade, and people said racist things all the time and nobody got offended. The only time someone got offended when you said something racist is when they would say, ‘Hey! You interrupted me! I was saying something racist!”

Louis C.K. continued in the same vein, then turned to comparing his children to Israel and Palestine and discussing how hard child molesters work at their eponymous pastime.
