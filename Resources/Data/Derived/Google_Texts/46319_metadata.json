Of the 60 homes proposed, 39 would be open market and 21 affordable.\n\nCouncillor Tony Johnson, ward member for the area, told the committee he had concerns about the size of the development.\n\nThat was shared by others, with Councillor Marcelle Lloyd-Hayes indicating that she would be much happier to support the application if it was for between 40 to 50 homes.\n\nThough there were no speakers at last Wednesday's meeting, Cradley Parish Council had previously registered objections to the proposal.\n\nConcerns were raised about the site's distance from the school, the possibility of Cradley losing its bus service and the local doctor\u2019s surgery being unable to cope with additional patients.\n\nCouncillor Sebastian Bowen highlighted his fears about access to the site.\n\n\u201cAccess is terrible,\u201d he said. \u201cThe lanes are all very narrow. The impact on the present inhabitants will be dire. It doesn't seem very good stuff.\u201d\n\nAnd Councillor Liz Harvey added that she would like to be seeing affordable houses which are \"affordable to live in, not just to buy\".\n\nFollowing a lengthy debate and after taking advice from planning officers, a new recommendation was proposed by Cllr Harvey.\n\nSixteen councillors voted to approve the application \u2013 subject to the detailed matters coming back to the committee.\n\nOne councillor voted against that recommendation, while two others abstained.", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "description": "THE full force of Herefordshire\u2019s shortage of five year housing land supply was felt last week when county planners gave the go-ahead to a new\u2026", "title": "Go-ahead given to Cradley homes plan but committee will hear detailed matters before building can start", "og": {"site_name": "Hereford Times", "name": "Go-ahead given to Cradley homes plan but committee will hear detailed matters before building can start", "title": "Go-ahead given to Cradley homes plan but committee will hear detailed matters before building can start", "url": "http://www.herefordtimes.com/news/11486782.Go_ahead_given_to_Cradley_homes_plan_but_committee_will_hear_detailed_matters_before_building_can_start/", "image": "http://www.herefordtimes.com/resources/images/3271529/", "type": "website", "description": "THE full force of Herefordshire\u2019s shortage of five year housing land supply was felt last week when county planners gave the go-ahead to a new\u2026"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://www.herefordtimes.com/resources/images/3271529/"}, "description": "THE full force of Herefordshire\u2019s shortage of five year housing land supply was felt last week when county planners gave the go-ahead to a new\u2026", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Go-ahead given to Cradley homes plan but committee will hear detailed matters before building can start"}, "vr": {"category": "News", "type": "Text"}, "fb": {"app_id": 129313517141239}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "News,Sport"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd01d\"", "article_summary": "Of the 60 homes proposed, 39 would be open market and 21 affordable.\nThe scheme proposed to take that access from the residential estate road that serves Pixiefields and onto the B4220.\nOne councillor voted against that recommendation, while two others abstained.\nSixteen councillors voted to approve the application \u2013 subject to the detailed matters coming back to the committee.\nQuercus PRF LLP was seeking permission to put up to 60 homes on land off Pixiefields, Westfields, in Cradley, with all matters, aside from access, to be reserved for future consideration."}
