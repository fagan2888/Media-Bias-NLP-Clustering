And it seems as though President Obama\u2019s recent jab at the network has many of Fox\u2019s hosts up in arms.\n\nWhile addressing students at Northwestern University, President Obama said the following.\n\n\u201cI have laid out my ideas to create more jobs and grow more wages. A true opposition party should have the courage to lay out theirs. There\u2019s a reason fewer Republicans are preaching doom on deficits\u2014because the deficits have come down at almost a record pace, and they\u2019re now manageable. There\u2019s a reason fewer Republicans are running against Obamacare\u2013because while good, affordable health care might seem like a fanged threat to the freedom of the American people on Fox News, it\u2019s working pretty well in the real world.\u201d\n\nObama also tweeted a very similar statement, saying, \u201cWhile affordable health care might still be a threat to freedom on Fox News, it\u2019s working pretty well in the real world.\u201d\n\nVarious Fox News network hosts immediately took insult to the remarks.\n\nGreta Van Susteren, who hosts the Fox News\u2019 show On the Record with Greta Van Susteren, said that Obama was not acting \u201cpresidential,\u201d needed to be \u201ctougher,\u201d and should quit blaming Fox News for his problems. In fact, the lead-in to the clip reads \u201cPresident Obama likes to play the blame game and blaming Fox News was red meat for his base. But he has to realize he doesn\u2019t hurt us and only diminishes his office.\u201d\n\nLaura Ingraham, a conservative political commentator, complained on Fox News\u2019 popular show The O\u2019Reilly Factor that Obama\u2019s jab at Fox\u2019s reporting on the Affordable Care Act was a \u201cclassic Alinskyite tactic\u201d and that \u201cliberalism, Obama-style, is failing.\u201d\n\nFox News host of The Five, Greg Gutfeld, also joined in his network\u2019s outrage, saying that the President \u201cbashes FNC more than ISIS, and we don\u2019t behead anybody!\u201d\n\nDespite their outrage, however, fact checking of Fox News coverage on the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, shows that the network has been, at the very best, skewed in their reporting. Sean Hannity devoted an entire episode to what he called \u201cObamacare Horror Stories,\u201d only to be corrected in an article by Salon, whose author tracked down each person on the show. PunditFact, a site hosted by Politifact, finds that statements it rates from Fox News rate \u201ctrue\u201d or \u201cmostly true\u201d only 22 percent of the time, while 62 percent of their checked statements are rated from \u201cmostly false\u201d to the infamous \u201cpants on fire\u201d rating.\n\n[Image via Washington Times]", "article_metadata": {"description": "There are few networks that do outrage better than Fox News.
