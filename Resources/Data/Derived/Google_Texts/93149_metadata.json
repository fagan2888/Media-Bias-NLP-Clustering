The company is facing fraud charges from the U.S. Justice Department for \u201cdumping\u201d 665,000 background check cases without conducting proper reviews.\n\nIt conducted the background checks for former National Security Agency contractor Snowden and Aaron Alexis, who had a Navy security clearance and worked at the Navy Yard. Alexis killed 12 people and wounded four before he was killed in a shootout with police.\n\nU.S. Investigations Services was not accused of wrongdoing in the background investigations of Snowden and Alexis, and neither were factors in the Justice Department probe.\n\nA spokeswoman for the company, Ellen Davis, said in an interview that the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) did not give a reason for terminating its contract.\n\n\u201cWe are deeply disappointed with OPM\u2019s decision, particularly given the excellent work our 3,000 employees have delivered on these contracts. While we disagree with the decision and are reviewing it, we intend to fulfill our obligations to ensure an orderly transition,\u201d the company said in a statement.\n\nThe company handles 40 percent of federal employee background investigations across more than 20 federal agencies, a statement from the company said. It conducts about 21,000 background investigations each month.\n\nThe Office of Personnel Management, which handles hiring of federal workers, decided to end its relationship with U.S. Investigations Services after a careful and comprehensive review, an agency representative said.\n\nA growing number of lawmakers had criticized the federal government for continuing its relationship with the company.\n\nLast week, U.S. lawmakers pushed the Department of Homeland Security to withdraw a $190 million border security contract awarded to the company in July.\n\nFCi Federal Inc, a smaller vetting firm, has filed a protest against the contract awarded to U.S. Investigation Services by Homeland Security\u2019s U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. Leesburg, Virginia-based FCi Federal argued that the federal fraud charges filed against its rival should have disqualified it from the work.\n\n(Additional reporting by Andrea Shalal; Editing by Jonathan Oatis)\n\n[Image via Agence France-Presse]", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": {"width": 800, "identifier": "http://www.rawstory.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/BC-News-video-frame-grab-shows-an-NBC-News-Exclusive-interview-with-Brian-Williams-and-Edward-Snowden-excerpted-from-a-May-28-2014-primetime-special-AFP-800x430.jpg", "height": 430}, "title": "U.S. drops contractor that did background checks for Snowden and Navy Yard shooter"}, "fb": {"app_id": 212555972273585}, "viewport": "width=device-width, user-scalable=yes, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=0.1, maximum-scale=10.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf69e\"", "article_summary": "It conducted the background checks for former National Security Agency contractor Snowden and Aaron Alexis, who had a Navy security clearance and worked at the Navy Yard.\nInvestigations Services was not accused of wrongdoing in the background investigations of Snowden and Alexis, and neither were factors in the Justice Department probe.\nInvestigations Services LLC, which carried out background checks on Edward Snowden (pictured above) and the man who shot 12 people to death at the Washington Navy Yard.\nThe company handles 40 percent of federal employee background investigations across more than 20 federal agencies, a statement from the company said.\nIt conducts about 21,000 background investigations each month."}
