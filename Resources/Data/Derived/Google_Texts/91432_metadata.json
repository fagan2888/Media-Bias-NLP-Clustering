But some states, including Iowa, are making it difficult for patients to access marijuana, and even more difficult for them to use their illness as a defense in court.\n\nOne man, 48-year-old Benton Mackenzie, suffers from an aggressive and rare form of cancer that attacks the blood vessels \u2014 and he\u2019s been placed on trial in Iowa for possession of marijuana, facing up to five years in prison. Recently, despite his tumors growing and his condition worsening, a judge ruled that he can\u2019t use his terminal cancer as a defense in his trial pressing charges for marijuana manufacturing and conspiracy.\n\nNon-Psychoactive Cannabidiol (CBD)\n\nMackenzie was arrested in 2013, when police raided his parents\u2019 home in Long Grove, Iowa and seized 71 marijuana plants. He was making cannabidiol, or CBD, which is a non-psychoactive compound in cannabis, in order to treat his tumors. CBD has been shown to have anti-inflammatory properties as well as analgesic, or pain-relieving, effects \u2014 without the psychoactive, or \u201cgetting high\u201d effect of delta-9 THC. Thus, CBD has been considered to have far more medical benefits than THC. Mackenzie\u2019s trial brings many issues into question, one of which is whether non-psychoactive cannabis extracts should be treated with the same prohibition as typical recreational marijuana that people smoke to get high, which affects the brain and central nervous system, altering a person's consciousness and behavior. While many states have begun acknowledging the positive health benefits of CBD, Iowa lags behind.\n\nAccording to the Facebook page Free Benton Mackenzie, which provides updates on the trial as well as graphic photos of his physical condition, Mackenzie claimed that his tumors had grown to the size of a grapefruit during his offer of proof on July 8. At the trial, he is covered with a blanket and is often seated in a wheelchair, as depicted by the following tweets from Brian Wellner:\n\n\"I'm not getting a fair trial,\" Benton Mackenzie says during break at his #marijuana trial. pic.twitter.com/O1Mpoz8tUq \u00e2\u20ac\u201d Brian Wellner (@brianwellner) July 8, 2014\n\nBREAKING: Benton Mackenzie testifying at his #marijuana trial. pic.twitter.com/xCARNakYSE \u2014 Brian Wellner (@brianwellner) July 8, 2014\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not allowed to mention anything,\u201d Mackenzie said. \u201cI\u2019m not allowed to give proof why I was using. Now, there is no fair trial.\u201d Mackenzie, his wife, Loretta, and his 22-year-old son are all facing charges of marijuana possession and could serve up to five years in prison. \u201cIf I\u2019m found guilty, I\u2019m a dead man,\u201d Mackenzie said.\n\nCannabis And Cancer\n\nMedical cannabis has been used by chemotherapy patients to reduce side effects of the treatment such as nausea and vomiting, and has also been used to treat epilepsy, AIDS, pain, and muscle spasticity. Typically, patients who use medical cannabis can access it through vaporizing or smoking buds, eating cannabis extracts, or taking capsules and even oral sprays. Medical cannabis is federally outlawed in the U.S. but legal in certain countries, including Austria, Canada, Czech Republic, Finland, Germany, Israel, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal, and Spain. However, 23 U.S. states, as well as Washington, D.C. have removed the medical use of marijuana from criminal law \u2014 meaning people can\u2019t be arrested and jailed for growing marijuana for the use of treating medical conditions. In other words, these states have \u201cdecriminalized\u201d medical marijuana.\n\nIn addition to its use in chemotherapy and epilepsy, some preliminary studies have shown that cannabis may have antitumor effects. According to the National Cancer Institute, a study in mice and rats showed that it might help protect against tumor development, through induction of cell death, the impairment of cell growth, and prevention of metastasis. Cannabinoids may have the ability to kill tumor cells while leaving the healthy cells safe. In addition, cannabinoids have also been shown to reduce pain. However, since the evidence is not yet conclusive and more research is needed to solidify it, many lawmakers remain stalwart in their views on medical marijuana.\n\nIowa\u2019s Medical Marijuana Laws Compared To The Rest Of The Country\n\nRecently, Iowa passed a \u201cMedical Cannabidiol Act\u201d that allows the use of cannabidiol extract (CBD) for medicinal purposes \u2014 but only pertains to patients with intractable epilepsy. In addition, the epilepsy must not have \u201cbeen responsive to other treatment options,\u201d and the patients\u2019 neurologists must believe that \u201cno other satisfactory alternative treatment options exist for the patients.\u201d Though this gives certain people with epilepsy access to CBD, the law is still extremely limiting for others like Mackenzie, who suffer from different \u2014 but equally severe \u2014 conditions.\n\n\"The change in law benefits only a small group of Iowans with the most organized lobbying efforts,\" the Des Moines Register editorial board wrote. \"Other sick Iowans should have legal access to marijuana extracts, too. These include people with painful and debilitating conditions like cancer, spinal cord injuries, and severe arthritis, who may benefit from the drug. But if these people obtain cannabis oil, they will still be considered criminals in this state.\"\n\nMeanwhile, as Iowa\u2019s state court fumbles over Mackenzie's trial, what many consider a ridiculous situation, other states such as New York have been taking steps forward to make medical marijuana more accessible \u2014 and safe. Terming it the \u201cCompassionate Care Act,\u201d which was signed into law by Gov. Andrew Cuomo on July 5, New York will now ban marijuana smoking but will mandate individual dosing of medical cannabis in all forms to help patients who need it.\n\n\u201cThe use of marijuana as a medicine is remarkably uncontroversial at the bedside of a cancer patient or a child suffering from convulsions who might be helped,\u201d Dr. Steven Patierno, a professor at the Duke University School of Medicine and deputy director of the Duke Cancer Institute, wrote in The Wall Street Journal. \u201cAs this consensus has grown into broad public acceptance, many state legislatures have leapfrogged federal prohibition and the Federal Drug Administration process to allow medical use of cannabis.\u201d\n\nThough the recent New York law may still need some tweaking moving forward, \u201c[b]y treating medical marijuana like other medicines, New York shifted the debate into the mainstream of modern medicine and set a much-needed national standard of care,\u201d Patierno wrote.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "cannabis, cannabidiol cbd, benton mackenzie", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Should terminal cancer patients be barred from using non-psychoactive medical cannabis extracts to fight tumors?", "title": "Cancer Patient Trial Opens Debate About Marijuana Extract Legality", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/iowa-cancer-patient-trial-growing-marijuana-should-non-psychoactive-extracts-be-treated-real-stuff", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/07/09/medical-marijuana.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Should terminal cancer patients be barred from using non-psychoactive medical cannabis extracts to fight tumors?", "title": "Cancer Patient Trial Opens Debate About Marijuana Extract Legality", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/iowa-cancer-patient-trial-growing-marijuana-should-non-psychoactive-extracts-be-treated-real-stuff", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/07/09/medical-marijuana.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/07/09/medical-marijuana.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2014-07-09T14:05:27-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-07-09T14:05:25-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Should terminal cancer patients be barred from using non-psychoactive medical cannabis extracts to fight tumors?"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf404\"", "article_summary": "However, since the evidence is not yet conclusive and more research is needed to solidify it, many lawmakers remain stalwart in their views on medical marijuana.\npic.twitter.com/O1Mpoz8tUq \u00e2\u20ac\u201d Brian Wellner (@brianwellner) July 8, 2014BREAKING: Benton Mackenzie testifying at his #marijuana trial.\nStates are slowly coming to terms with the evidence that medical cannabis can treat and ease symptoms for disorders like epilepsy, cancer, and AIDS.\nTypically, patients who use medical cannabis can access it through vaporizing or smoking buds, eating cannabis extracts, or taking capsules and even oral sprays.\nMedical cannabis is federally outlawed in the U.S. but legal in certain countries, including Austria, Canada, Czech Republic, Finland, Germany, Israel, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal, and Spain."}
