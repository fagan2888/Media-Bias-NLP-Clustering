Associated Press\n\nThe team of writers behind former billionaire Samuel Wyly\u2019s book projects have been let go after a bankruptcy judge warned the Texas entrepreneur that he can\u2019t have both his luxuries and bankruptcy protection.\n\n\u201cThe book projects have been temporarily suspended,\u201d according to a new budget that cut out the $32,000 monthly cost of two personal writing assistants.\n\nMr. Wyly has previously written books on entrepreneurship and had planned to continue writing even after he filed for bankruptcy last month, unable to afford to pay the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission a nearly $200 million judgment for securities fraud.\n\nBut U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Barbara Houser wanted to know if Mr. Wyly would make any money from publishing new books, saying his budget for expenditures \u201cneeds to be carefully scrubbed.\u201d An SEC lawyer called the numbers in an earlier proposed budget \u201cexorbitantly inflated,\u201d pointing out that it contained mortgage payments on his wife\u2019s bookstore in Aspen, Colo., and $2,200 for pool, home maintenance and landscaping.\n\nJudge Houser will review the new budget proposal (read it here) on Friday a hearing in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Dallas, Texas.\n\nMr. Wyly, 80, was hit with a $198.1 million judgment for securities fraud involving secret trading through offshore accounts. The 13-year scheme resulted in a guilty verdict on nine different violations of the federal securities laws in May.\n\nA federal judge recently froze Mr. Wyly\u2019s assets to prevent money from his trust accounts on the Isle of Man from flowing to family members. The transfers could deplete the pool of money available to the Securities and Exchange Commission.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "The team of writers behind former billionaire Samuel Wyly\u2019s book projects have been let go after a bankruptcy judge warned the Texas entrepreneur that he can\u2019t have both his luxuries and bankruptcy protection.", "title": "Bankruptcy Judge Shuts Down Sam Wyly Book Projects", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/bankruptcy/2014/11/06/bankrutpcy-judge-shuts-down-sam-wyly-book-projects/", "image": {"src": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-FH360_wyly10_P_20141030102327.jpg"}, "site": "WSJ", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Markets", "article.headline": "Bankruptcy Judge Shuts Down Sam Wyly Book Projects", "description": "The team of writers behind former billionaire Samuel Wyly\u2019s book projects have been let go after a bankruptcy judge warned the Texas entrepreneur that he can\u2019t have both his luxuries and bankruptcy protection.", "article_section": "Markets", "author": "Katy Stech", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "testkeys": "C", "article.page": "Bankruptcy Beat Blog", "page.subsection": "Bankruptcy Beat", "article.summary": "The team of writers behind former billionaire Samuel Wyly\u2019s book projects have been let go after a bankruptcy judge warned the Texas entrepreneur that he can\u2019t have both his luxuries and bankruptcy protection.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "page.content.format": "responsive", "article.published": "2014-11-06T18:01:51-05:00", "dj.asn": "10-210", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/bankruptcy/2014/11/06/bankrutpcy-judge-shuts-down-sam-wyly-book-projects/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-BANKB-20320", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Markets", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "The team of writers behind former billionaire Samuel Wyly\u2019s book projects have been let go after a bankruptcy judge warned the Texas entrepreneur that he can\u2019t have both his luxuries and bankruptcy protection.", "title": "Bankruptcy Judge Shuts Down Sam Wyly Book Projects", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/bankruptcy/2014/11/06/bankrutpcy-judge-shuts-down-sam-wyly-book-projects/", "image": {"width": 749, "identifier": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-FH360_wyly10_P_20141030102327.jpg", "height": 499}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Bankruptcy Beat", "article.id": "BL-BANKB-20320", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2014-11-07T01:17:24-05:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1c39\"", "article_summary": "Associated PressThe team of writers behind former billionaire Samuel Wyly\u2019s book projects have been let go after a bankruptcy judge warned the Texas entrepreneur that he can\u2019t have both his luxuries and bankruptcy protection.\nThe 13-year scheme resulted in a guilty verdict on nine different violations of the federal securities laws in May.\nTexas entrepreneur Sam Wyly arrives at federal court in New York in May for closing arguments his civil trial.\nA federal judge recently froze Mr. Wyly\u2019s assets to prevent money from his trust accounts on the Isle of Man from flowing to family members.\nJudge Houser will review the new budget proposal (read it here) on Friday a hearing in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Dallas, Texas."}
