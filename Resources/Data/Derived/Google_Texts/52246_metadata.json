CareDox provides a care coordination platform for taking care of kids. It also automates the collection of health-related data (no more paper forms) and makes it more easily accessible by school nurses, for example.\n\nThe platform allows for desktop or mobile access to information in the records.\n\nNew York City-based CareDox was founded in 2010 and grew up in the NYC-based accelerator Startup Health Academy.\n\nThe company is now ready to raise some venture capital. According to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission dated August 7, Caredox has raised about $2.5 million of a targeted $3.1 million round.\n\nPreviously, the company took $1.5 million in debt financing in April 2011.\n\nThe filing says that Caredox may be taking the investment in exchange for both equity in the company, or stock options, or other securities.\n\nWhen VentureBeat called the company\u2019s offices for comment, a voice on the other end said, \u201cWe\u2019re not interested in talking,\u201d and abruptly hung up. Presumably the company is not ready to talk about who contributed the new money or what it plans to do with it.\n\nCareDox lists as existing investors First Round Capital, Charles River Ventures, Band of Angels, and Giza Ventures.", "article_metadata": {"bt": {"pubDate": "2014-08-08T18:15:00+00:00", "author": "mark-sullivan", "modDate": "2014-08-08T18:15:00+00:00", "keywords": "null", "type": "news", "id": 1523056}, "og": {"site_name": "VentureBeat", "description": "CareDox's product grew out of an earlier product that helped moms share their kids' medical records with schools, summer camps, and physicians.", "title": "CareDox is raising a $3.1M booster round for cloud health\u00a0records", "url": "http://venturebeat.com/2014/08/08/caredox-is-raising-a-3-1m-booster-round-for-cloud-health-records/", "image": "http://1u88jj3r4db2x4txp44yqfj1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/obamacare-could-be-a-shot-in-the-arm-for-entrepreneurs-780x493.jpg", "type": "article"}, "description": "CareDox\u2019s product grew out of an earlier product that helped moms share their kids\u2019 medical records with schools, summer camps, and physicians.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "CareDox\u2019s product grew out of an earlier product that helped moms share their kids\u2019 medical records with schools, summer camps, and physicians.\nCareDox lists as existing investors First Round Capital, Charles River Ventures, Band of Angels, and Giza Ventures.\nNew York City-based CareDox was founded in 2010 and grew up in the NYC-based accelerator Startup Health Academy.\nCareDox provides a care coordination platform for taking care of kids.\nAccording to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission dated August 7, Caredox has raised about $2.5 million of a targeted $3.1 million round."}
