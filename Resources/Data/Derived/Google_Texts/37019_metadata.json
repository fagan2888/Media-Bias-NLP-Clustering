Ted Cruz is not calling this a filibuster. Instead, Cruz has promised to speak until he can no longer stand. This means that Ted Cruz is filibustering.\n\nFox News is doing everything they can to make sure that their viewers know as little as possible about Cruz\u2019s efforts. Their strategy is to cut to a breaking news update, and show Cruz talking on the Senate floor. What they don\u2019t provide is audio of what Cruz is saying. Instead, Fox News has guests talk about how Cruz\u2019s efforts are going to fail, and what will happen in the House after the Senate sent them a clean continuing resolution.\n\nIn short, Fox News put a gag on Ted Cruz. Fox has banished Cruz to a live video stream on their website. Fox News\u2019 strategy is to take live looks at Cruz while providing no sound. Fox News described what Cruz is doing in their 3:30 PM ET update as, \u201cHe\u2019s talking, and he\u2019s talking. He\u2019s probably going to talk for several hours.\u201d Fox News then helpfully added that Cruz doesn\u2019t have the votes to stop the vote.\n\nIt is interesting to see the Fox News tactics usually used on Democrats being turned on Ted Cruz. As the Republican heavily hitters have taken action, we have seen the life sucked out of the defund Obamcare or shutdown the government movement. Now Fox News is doing their part to keep their viewed informed with only the information that they want them to have.\n\nFox News hasn\u2019t put a syllable of what Ted Cruz is saying on the air. They keeping the Texas senator almost out of sight, and definitely out of mind.", "article_metadata": {"description": "This afternoon Ted Cruz launched a filibuster against funding Obamacare, which Fox News did their part to sabotage, by showing the video, but substituting their own discussion of how Cruz will fail.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "author": "Jason Easley", "og": {"site_name": "Politicus USA", "description": "This afternoon Ted Cruz launched a filibuster against funding Obamacare, which Fox News did their part to sabotage, by showing the video, but substituting their own discussion of how Cruz will fail.", "title": "Fox News Sabotages Ted Cruz's Defund Obamacare Filibuster by Cutting His Audio", "url": "http://www.politicususa.com/2013/09/24/fox-news-sabotages-ted-cruzs-defund-obamacare-filibuster-cutting-audio.html", "image": "http://15130-presscdn-0-89.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/cruz-obamacare-filibuster-1.jpg", "updated_time": "2013-09-24T15:40:48+00:00", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 523732690, "app_id": 113462415332922, "pages": 186473214703370}, "keywords": "Featured News,ted cruz defund obamacare filibuster,ted cruz filibuster,ted cruz obamacare filibuster,politicususa,liberal,politics,sarah jones,jason easley,barack obama,hillary clinton,bernie sanders,msnbc,media", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/PoliticusUSA", "section": "Featured News", "published_time": "2013-09-24T15:40:48+00:00", "modified_time": "2013-09-24T15:40:48+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "ted cruz defund obamacare filibuster, ted cruz filibuster, ted cruz obamacare filibuster"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdab3b\"", "article_summary": "Here is the beginning of Cruz\u2019s filibuster on C-SPAN:Because he can\u2019t stop anything, Sen.
