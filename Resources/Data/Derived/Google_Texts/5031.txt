NBC Bob Costas, right, and Matt Lauer appear on NBC News’ “Today” show.

Bob Costas was swilling his vodka. It was Tuesday morning in NBC’s studios in Sochi when Costas, the face of the network’s Olympics coverage, clinked glasses with his colleague Mary Carillo. He also pointed to his face.

“My eyes can’t get any redder,” he said. “Here we go. Down the hatch!”

It isn’t unusual for a strange sight to emerge as an Olympics phenomenon. At the London Games, for example, the lasting image was U.S. gymnast McKayla Maroney flashing an unimpressed scowl on the medal stand.

But no one was betting on Costas’s red eyes as the spectacle of the Sochi Games.

In the opening minutes of NBC’s first broadcast last week, a bespectacled Costas announced he was staring down an eye issue, having woken up with one eye swollen shut. But a viral infection spread to his other eye for Monday’s broadcast, making for an unseemly vision on NBC. His blurry and sensitive eyes made it impossible for Costas to complete his hosting duties, he said, and NBC announced Tuesday that Matt Lauer would replace Costas on the network’s primetime and late-night Olympics broadcasts, part of a package that cost the network $775 million.

Tuesday would be the first night since 1988 that someone other than Costas hosted NBC’s primetime Olympics show, a streak that lasted 157 consecutive nights, according to NBC publicists. The network has listed its star anchor as day-to-day. Costas said he hoped his condition would improve “in the next couple of days” and that he would return to his seat.

“The last thing I want to do is go through the rest of my life owing Matt Lauer a bunch of favors,” Costas said in a news release.
