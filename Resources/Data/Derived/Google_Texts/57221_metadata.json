Steve Beshear and Governor-elect Matt Bevin have drastically different views of Kynect, the health care exchange Beshear established under the Affordable Care Act. While they consider the future of the program, others are thinking about what dismantling Kynect may mean for them and their neighbors.\n\nDoug Justice is a \u201cKynector\u201d based in Jackson County in Eastern Kentucky. His job is to help residents sign up for insurance through Kynect. Twice a week, he can be found at Jackson Public Library helping people enroll in a health insurance policy.\n\nJustice said he\u2019s concerned about Bevin\u2019s pledge to dismantle the state\u2019s health insurance exchange, which he could accomplish by the end of 2016 at the soonest.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a ton of people that\u2019s on it, and you just can\u2019t say, \u2018OK, you don\u2019t have insurance anymore,'\u201d he said, adding that he hopes Bevin\u2019s administration will soften its stance against the health care overhaul.\n\nRelated Story Long Process For Bevin to Roll Back Medicaid in Kentucky\n\nIn Jackson County, 50 percent of residents have Medicaid, which includes 2,021 people who have gained insurance through the ACA\u2019s Medicaid expansion and 4,584 individuals who are enrolled in traditional Medicaid. About 300 people are enrolled in a qualified health plan through Kynect.\n\nSince 2013, more than 500,000 Kentuckians have enrolled in a qualified health plan or Medicaid expansion through Kynect.\n\nBevin has the state\u2019s health insurance exchange is redundant because Kentuckians can get similar access to health insurance plans via the federal exchange. He also said the state cannot afford the cost of the Medicaid expansion once the federal government begins requiring states to pick up the tab for the additional recipients. That cost is estimated at $409 million annually beginning in 2020.\n\nThe governor-elect has yet to reveal specific plans for how he would roll back the Medicaid expansion, but he has recommitted since his election earlier this month to dismantling the insurance exchange.\n\nLike thousands of Kentuckians who\u2019ve recently gained health insurance, the prospective changes mean uncertainty for Justice, too. He is employed as a Kynector through the Kentucky River Foothills Development Council. He said he would no longer have a job if Kynect closed. But he\u2019s not convinced that will happen.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think they\u2019ll do completely away with it. I think they\u2019ll revamp it, change it around some, and that\u2019s fine,\u201d Justice said.\n\nAudrey Haynes, secretary of the Kentucky Cabinet for Health and Family Services, recently said nearly 175 employees of a Kynect a call center in Lexington may also lose their jobs if the exchange is closed.\n\nShe said changes to the health care exchange may also affect insurance agents, who sold more than 50 percent of private health plans.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Governor-elect Matt Bevin intends to dismantle Kynect and roll back the state's Medicaid expansion.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "89.3 WFPL", "description": "Governor-elect Matt Bevin intends to dismantle Kynect and roll back the state's Medicaid expansion.", "title": "Rural 'Kynector' Awaits Future of Kentucky's Health Exchange", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 3529, "identifier": "http://wfpl.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/20150226_124746-e1432811136902.jpg", "height": 1217}, "updated_time": "2015-11-28T08:13:54-04:00", "url": "http://wfpl.org/kynector-awaits-future-kentuckys-health-care-exchange/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Governor-elect Matt Bevin intends to dismantle Kynect and roll back the state's Medicaid expansion.", "creator": "@JaNelSJohnson", "image": "http://wfpl.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/20150226_124746-e1432811136902.jpg", "title": "Rural 'Kynector' Awaits Future of Kentucky's Health Exchange", "site": "@WFPLNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"admins": 100006229511236, "pages": 33077174555, "app_id": 1539400482939529}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wfpllouisville", "section": "Health", "tag": "affordable care act", "published_time": "2015-11-27T09:55:40-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-11-28T08:13:54-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "Bevin has the state\u2019s health insurance exchange is redundant because Kentuckians can get similar access to health insurance plans via the federal exchange.\nThe future of Kentucky\u2019s health insurance exchange is being analyzed by the state\u2019s outgoing and incoming administrations.\nShe said changes to the health care exchange may also affect insurance agents, who sold more than 50 percent of private health plans.\nSteve Beshear and Governor-elect Matt Bevin have drastically different views of Kynect, the health care exchange Beshear established under the Affordable Care Act.\nJustice said he\u2019s concerned about Bevin\u2019s pledge to dismantle the state\u2019s health insurance exchange, which he could accomplish by the end of 2016 at the soonest."}
