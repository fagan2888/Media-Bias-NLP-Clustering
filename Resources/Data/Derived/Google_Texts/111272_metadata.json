Getty Images\n\nEvery week, CIO Journal offers a glimpse into the mind of the CEO, whose view of technology is shaped by stories in management journals, general interest magazines and, of course, in-flight publications.\n\nWelcome to the drone age. If the unmanned aerial vehicle industry could be compared to the evolution of the PC industry, some analysts think drones are having their \u201c1984\u201d\u201dMacintosh moment. \u201cIt is hard to think of a business which could not benefit from a PC, whereas many may not benefit (at least directly) from drones,\u201d says the Economist. But drones are already involved in agriculture, filmmaking, land-surveying and delivering things. Now startups are working on developing better \u201csend-and-avoid\u201d technology using neural networks as well as better avionics for increased flight time. \u201cThe future of the this market will have many twists and turns,\u201d the Economist concludes, \u201cbut all the signs suggest that the air will soon be abuzz with machines.\u201d\n\n10-hour commutes are a thing now. David Neeleman, founder of JetBlue Airwaysand CEO of Brazilian airline Azul commutes every week from Connecticut to Azul\u2019s headquarters in Sao Paolo. He leaves Sunday, returns on Thursday. More and more executives are choosing melatonin-riddled commutes on a permanent basis, Quartz writes. Globalization and tech-enabled flexibility has something to do with it, but so does a shift in priorities of many top executives. \u201cMen in particular, are putting more value on being a good parent, not just a provider, and in some sense that might mean not moving their kids,\u201d says the president of the Families and Work Institute.\n\nAlphas rock retro tech.
