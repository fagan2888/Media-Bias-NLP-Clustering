Lee said the agency would redouble efforts to convince Latinos to sign up for health insurance, many for the first time.\n\n\u201cMany Latinos have never had insurance before,\u201d Lee said. \u201cWe need to work on dispelling the myth that insurance is not affordable. In-person assistance will be vital.\u201d\n\nIn the midst of a 21-city bus tour to tout a new enrollment period that started last weekend and continues through Feb. 15, Lee said the focus will continue to be on one-on-one counseling and enrollment assistance, particularly in heavily Latino communities such as Salinas and others in Monterey County.\n\nCovered California has been lauded as a national model for implementation of the Affordable Care Act, after recording about 1.2 million paid enrollees through the state exchange and adding about 2.2 million new Medi-Cal enrollees through the federally funded expansion of the program. The efforts cut the number of California\u2019s uninsured in half.\n\nIn Monterey County, a total of 16,523 people purchased health insurance through the exchange, according to Covered California, while county social services director Elliott Robinson reported a 40,000-enrollee increase in Medi-Cal over the past year.\n\nDespite the success, Covered California was still criticized for falling short on enrolling Latinos.\n\nLee acknowledged that only about 31 percent of health exchange enrollees were Latino, lower than the group\u2019s share of the state\u2019s population and well short of those eligible for coverage, estimated at 46 percent. Latinos with limited English proficiency were even less likely to have signed up so far, making Spanish-language outreach essential.\n\nAccording to Lee, Covered California is facing an even greater challenge getting people to sign up during the new enrollment period \u2014 the state\u2019s remaining uninsured have about half as much time to enroll, and a large number of the estimated 3.2 million remaining uninsured have never had insurance or have gone a long time without coverage and have developed a \u201cculture of coping.\u201d And many of the newly insured have never experienced the renewal process, increasing the risk they may drop coverage.\n\nMeanwhile, Lee acknowledged that Monterey County is \u201cone of very few areas in the state\u201d where the exchange offers just a single insurance provider \u2014 Anthem Blue Cross \u2014 for 2015 after Health Net decided to only offer out-of-network coverage, meaning a narrower health care provider network and less choice for locals. Lee said Monterey County has historically been a \u201cvery challenging area\u201d for insurance providers to reach contract agreements with local physicians.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLee said Covered California still does not plan to offer online directories of health care providers, including hospitals, clinics and doctors, and will only offer links to the insurance companies\u2019 own website directories. Covered California has been working with insurance companies on the exchange to improve provider directories, after criticism that directories on the Covered California website were inaccurate, he said.\n\nWhile Lee said the exchange must balance affordability and provider choice, he added that health insurance coverage is \u201cnot just an insurance card, but access to care.\u201d\n\nJim Johnson can be reached at 831-726-4348.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Salinas >> Covered California will \u201cdouble-down\u201d on its strategy to reach out to uninsured Latinos during a new enrollment period for health care under the state-run insurance exchange, the group\u2019s top executive said Monday.", "title": "Covered California visits Salinas, redoubles Latino enrollment efforts", "og": {"url": "http://www.montereyherald.com/article/NF/20141117/NEWS/141119832", "image": {"width": "1024px", "identifier": "http://www.montereyherald.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/NF/20141117/NEWS/141119832/AR/0/AR-141119832.jpg?Maxh=1500&Maxw=1500", "height": "764px"}, "type": "article", "title": "Covered California visits Salinas, redoubles Latino enrollment efforts"}, "twitter": {"domain": "montereyherald.com", "description": "Salinas >> Covered California will \u201cdouble-down\u201d on its strategy to reach out to uninsured Latinos during a new enrollment period for health care under the state-run insurance exchange, the group\u2019s top executive said Monday.", "title": "Covered California visits Salinas, redoubles Latino enrollment efforts", "url": "http://www.montereyherald.com/article/NF/20141117/NEWS/141119832", "image": {"src": "http://www.montereyherald.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/NF/20141117/NEWS/141119832/AR/0/AR-141119832.jpg?Maxh=900&Maxw=900"}, "site": "@montereyherald", "app": {"id": {"ipad": "id507308258", "iphone": "id507305181", "googleplay": "com.spreedinc.providers.digitalfirstmedia.montereyherald"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "keywords": "news_local, Health", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "news_local, Health"}, "article_summary": "Covered California has been working with insurance companies on the exchange to improve provider directories, after criticism that directories on the Covered California website were inaccurate, he said.\nLee said the agency would redouble efforts to convince Latinos to sign up for health insurance, many for the first time.\nSalinas >> Covered California will \u201cdouble-down\u201d on its strategy to reach out to uninsured Latinos during a new enrollment period for health care under the state-run insurance exchange, the group\u2019s top executive said Monday.\nDespite the success, Covered California was still criticized for falling short on enrolling Latinos.\nIn Monterey County, a total of 16,523 people purchased health insurance through the exchange, according to Covered California, while county social services director Elliott Robinson reported a 40,000-enrollee increase in Medi-Cal over the past year."}
