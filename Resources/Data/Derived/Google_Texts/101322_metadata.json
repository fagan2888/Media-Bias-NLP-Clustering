He just lost his wife of 38 years to a short illness and can\u2019t seem to cope without her.\n\nTo make matters worse, he retired two months before she died.\n\nHis 34-year-old daughter invites him to meals and outings, but he doesn\u2019t seem to see or know his grandchildren. He just sits and stares into space for much of the day, locked into his grief.\n\nDad, in this case, is a character in a scenario, a subject for suggestions from about 20 employees of Longmont United Hospital. He\u2019s part of a mental health first-aid course that aims to make treating the mind as normal as treating the body.\n\nHe\u2019s also part of something the Centura Health system does to maintain its nonprofit status and exemption from federal taxes.\n\nAcross the United States, every nonprofit hospital must provide community benefits to qualify for tax exemption. The Affordable Care Act added requirements, such as periodically assessing community health needs, but also allows a broad range of community benefit choices.\n\nUnpaid care counts. As do allowed differences between hospital fees and federal reimbursements for hospital care.\n\nIn Colorado, community benefit spending totaled more than $2.1 billion in fiscal 2014, according to a Colorado Hospital Association survey of 56 hospitals in the state.\n\nHealth screenings, education, free clinics, discounted services and charitable contributions all count toward the exempt status. But about 85 percent of community benefit spending fell into what the hospital association calls \u201cunpaid costs of patient care.\u201d\n\nBesides patients who don\u2019t pay, that includes \u201cboth Medicaid payment shortfall and Medicare allowable payment shortfall,\u201d said association spokeswoman Cara Welch.\n\nThe association does not release hospital-specific data. But a few large hospital systems account for much of the money.\n\nThe University of Colorado Health system, which includes five Front Range hospitals, spent $500 million in fiscal 2015 on financial assistance, subsidized care and other programs that benefit patients and the communities it serves, spokesman Dan Weaver said.\n\nThose included education programs for expectant mothers, cooking classes for cancer patients, a free nurse call center, financial aid to support faculty members\u2019 clinical work and Christmas toys for kids at a local school. About $185 million came from uncompensated costs of patient care, including Medicaid.\n\nChildren\u2019s Hospital Colorado offers, among other things, a \u201cfirst 1,000 days initiative\u201d to support children from birth through age 2, a behavioral health program in Aurora and an asthma program in schools, \u201cthe only long-running organized school-based initiative of its kind in Colorado,\u201d spokeswoman Elizabeth Whitehead said.\n\nAll told, the hospital reported $174 million in community benefit activities in 2014. Of that, $118 million came from unreimbursed costs for providing care to patients, including those enrolled in Medicaid.\n\nThe 17-hospital Centura network in Colorado and Kansas reported spending $255 million for unreimbursed care and community benefits in fiscal 2015.\n\nJames Corbett, its senior vice president of community health improvement, said Centura does not disclose the unreimbursed care portion because hospitals account for community benefits in such different ways that comparisons would be meaningless.\n\nCorbett sees the Affordable Care Act driving some changes in the ways hospitals operate, including their approaches to community benefits.\n\nHe describes Centura\u2019s devotion to mental health first aid as an example.\n\nHospitals have counted \u201crandom acts of kindness\u201d by \u201cpeople who are well-intentioned and good-hearted,\u201d he said, without \u201ca strategic, planned approach to improving the ills\u201d of patients.\n\nCentura held focus groups in schools and churches, he said, and mental health problems \u201ccame up in every one of our communities.\u201d\n\nOn this issue, \u201cI think we are definitely at the forefront\u201d with a systemwide commitment, he said.\n\nAt Longmont Hospital, the day-long mental health first-aid course is taught by Angela MacDonald, a behavioral health manager with master\u2019s degrees in social work and divinity.\n\nHer course materials emphasize how common mental health problems are. One-fifth of all people are affected each year, more than half in their lifetimes.\n\nMacDonald divides the class into four groups to discuss four different scenarios. Each must decide whether their character is a candidate for a mental health action plan calling them to assess risk, listen nonjudgmentally, give reassurance, encourage appropriate professional help and encourage self-help.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t take long to decide that 66-year-old dad needs help.\n\nHer class also went down a list of helpful \u2014 and not so helpful \u2014 things to say to someone showing signs of anxiety or depression.\n\nSome, they agreed, get overused and may turn the conversation back to yourself: \u201cI understand and know exactly what you are going through. That happened to me two years ago.\u201d\n\nBetter: \u201cLet\u2019s go and have a cup of tea\u201d or \u201cSomething seems to be bothering you. Do you want to talk about it?\u201d\n\nDavid Olinger: 303-954-1498, dolinger@denverpost.com or @dolingerdp", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Colorado hospitals claim billions in community benefit programs", "title": "Colorado hospitals claim billions in community benefit programs", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/02/07/colorado-hospitals-claim-billions-in-community-benefit-programs/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "height": 630}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2016-02-07T20:16:30+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-07T20:16:30+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd190e\"", "article_summary": "In Colorado, community benefit spending totaled more than $2.1 billion in fiscal 2014, according to a Colorado Hospital Association survey of 56 hospitals in the state.\nThe Affordable Care Act added requirements, such as periodically assessing community health needs, but also allows a broad range of community benefit choices.\nHe\u2019s part of a mental health first-aid course that aims to make treating the mind as normal as treating the body.\nAs do allowed differences between hospital fees and federal reimbursements for hospital care.\nAll told, the hospital reported $174 million in community benefit activities in 2014."}
