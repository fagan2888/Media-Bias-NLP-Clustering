American Apparel issued a public apology Thursday after the company posted a picture of the space shuttle Challenger disaster to its Tumblr page, saying it was fireworks.

The Los Angeles Times reports the company said it was an honest mistake by a young social media employee who was born after the 1986 explosion that killed all seven crew members.

The company deleted the post and issued an apology.
