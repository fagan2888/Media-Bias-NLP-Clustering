We can stick with the status quo \u2014 the Affordable Care Act, which leaves hundreds of thousands with no health insurance \u2014 or we can switch to a new health plan, designed in Colorado, that will cover everybody and cut costs sharply for almost every family and business in the state.\n\nThis new plan has been named ColoradoCare, precisely because it is not Obamacare. It\u2019s a system of universal coverage proposed by state Sen. Irene Aguilar, a Denver physician, along with health policy experts around the state. When Aguilar\u2019s plan came up in the legislature, the private insurance companies crushed it. They fear (and they\u2019re right) that competition from ColoradoCare will force them to cut their soaring premiums.\n\nIn Colorado, though, politicians and lobbyists in the state Capitol don\u2019t get the last word on key policy issues. So a group of people started a petition drive to put the plan before the voters. With little organization and less money, they gathered 156,000 signatures from every corner of the state \u2014 far more than enough to get ColoradoCare on the November 2016 ballot.\n\nThis response is not surprising when you consider the many ways ColoradoCare will improve on what we\u2019ve got now.\n\n\u2022 ColoradoCare will cover every resident from birth to age 65. (Seniors will keep Medicare as their primary insurance.) Obamacare, in contrast, leaves more than 400,000 of us with no insurance at all, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Those 400,000 uninsured head to the emergency room when they need medical care \u2014 the most expensive possible place \u2014 and the rest of us get stuck with their bills. With ColoradoCare, everybody will have health coverage.\n\n\u2022 The new plan will save billions in administrative costs. Private insurers now fritter away 20 percent of premium revenues on paperwork, marketing, salaries, etc. And that\u2019s legal under Obamacare. In contrast, ColoradoCare is designed to work like Medicare, with administrative costs under 4 percent.\n\n\u2022 ColoradoCare will not use the \u201cin-network, out-of-network\u201d gimmick that private insurers created to limit your choice of doctors or hospitals. It\u2019s a basic principle of the new plan that the patient, not the insurance company, picks the doctor, chiropractor, physical therapist, hospital, lab, etc. ColoradoCare will cover every provider.\n\n\u2022 The initiative clearly states that Coloradans will still have the right to use TriCare, the VA, or private insurance if they want to. The industry says this new low-cost plan will mean the end of for-profit health insurance. But why? If private insurers can provide decent coverage at a reasonable price, they\u2019ll do fine. But if they continue to raise their premiums each year at triple the rate of inflation, they will lose business to the new competitor. That\u2019s the free market at work.\n\nColoradoCare will be financed by a payroll tax paid by all workers over the poverty line and their employers. For nearly every family and firm, this fee will be sharply less than what they\u2019re paying for health care now. Independent estimates say the plan will save Coloradans some $5 billion per year in health insurance costs. Doctors and hospitals will have a much lower paperwork burden.\n\nOn talk radio, Rush Limbaugh, etc., have opposed ColoradoCare, saying it\u2019s a tax increase (in fact, it will cut costs for almost everybody). But a vote against ColoradoCare will be a vote for the current system, which is Obamacare. \u201cLimbaugh backs Obamacare!\u201d There\u2019s a headline for you.\n\nWhen we pass it, Colorado Care will prompt national headlines. Other states will follow us, just as they have on issues like fracking, marijuana and reduction of teen pregnancy. So Colorado will lead the nation to a destination we should have reached long ago: Quality health care, at reasonable cost, for every American.\n\nT.R.
