The Baton Rouge General Mid City emergency room is closing because of Gov. Bobby Jindal's refusal to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, an analysis in the Los Angeles Times says.

"Jindal has tried to position himself as the last stalwart Republican opponent of the ACA, but his state's experience shows that his position is folly," the article says.

The emergency room in Mid City is set to close at the end of March, the only facility between Zachary and south Baton Rouge.

Baton Rouge General announced Feb. 3 it would close its Mid City emergency room in April. The hospital said last August it would shutdown the ER, but an infusion of $18 million from the Department of Health and Hospitals allowed it -- temporarily, as it turns out -- to remain open.

However, the Mid City hospital, has struggled to handle the cost of uninsured patients, many who view the ER as a primary care destination, since Earl K. Long Medical Center closed in 2013.

Baton Rouge General officials say the campus is losing money at an alarming rate: from $12.5 million in 2013, to $23.8 million in 2014, to a projected $25 million to $30 million in 2015.

Department of Health and Hospitals officials are meeting with residents Tuesday evening to discuss access to health care services in Mid City and north Baton Rouge.
