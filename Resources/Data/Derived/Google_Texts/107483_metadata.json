Kotelevskaya complained of jaw pain in the weeks that followed, and a biopsy revealed to doctors at the time the undeniable presence of a tumor. They began radiation treatment. But according to her current surgeon, Dr. Jarrod Little, of the University of Louisville, what the doctors actually saw could\u2019ve been nothing more than a benign cyst.\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t see this often or a pathologist doesn\u2019t know it, very often it can be mistaken for cancer under the microscope,\u201d Little, who is performing the 24-hour million dollar surgery at no cost, told ABC News. What Kotelevskaya ended up with instead was a gauntlet of therapy sessions designed to treat cancer that wasn\u2019t there. Her weight fell to 79 pounds, says her cousin, Oleg Sennik. As a result of the treatment, Kotelevskaya is unable to open her jaw more than a millimeter. Most food slides out the side of her mouth, and the portions that stay inside she has to mash in the only corner of her jaw that functions.\n\nBasically, the radiation killed a large patch of healthy tissue inside Kotelevskaya\u2019s jaw. She has a hole in her check and no jaw bone on one side, according to Little, whose task now is to draw a segment of bone from Kotelevskaya\u2019s fibula, with some skin still attached, and use it as a replacement jawbone. The residual skin will replace the inner portion of her mouth.\n\nLife in the U.S. for Kotelevskaya has been a full reversal from her previous life. When she immigrated to Kentucky in 2013, with her 7-year-old son Erik in tow, she was homeless. Her health was declining rapidly. It had been nearly a decade since her accident, and the one hope she had \u2014 little did she know \u2014 was Sennik, who fled to Kentucky in 1996 to escape the Chernobyl nuclear meltdown. Since the breakup of the former Soviet Union, he had been looking for the rest of his family.\n\nAfter much fruitless searching, Sennik eventually tracked down his cousin, whom he began visiting frequently. He took her to a doctor in Ukraine, who informed her that she didn\u2019t have cancer. In fact, she never did. The hole in her jaw and missing tissue were all a product of a botched diagnosis.\n\nSennik, a hairdresser in Kentucky, began telling his clients of his cousin\u2019s story. One helpful referral later, and the cousins were in conversation with Little, who upon hearing Kotelevskaya\u2019s story, immediately agreed to do the operation for free. \u201cPlastic surgery is typically associated with cosmetic stuff, and this is the other part of plastics that took 11 years of training after college,\u201d he said to ABC News. \u201cThis makes it all worthwhile.\u201d\n\nLittle\u2019s generosity and the unexpectedly warm compassion extended by the hospital staff have compelled Kotelevskaya to attend nursing school. Because of what she experienced, Sennik says, she had always feared hospitals. A decade worth of medical failures caused her to reel at the idea of further treatment. But the University of Louisville team restored her faith in the practice, he says. \u201cShe is so grateful. She says, \u2018Oh my God, I would love to work as a nurse to help people.\u2019 The hospital has totally changed her mind.\u201d\n\nABC US News | ABC Celebrity News", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "cancer, misdiagnosis, leaves, woman, disfigured, after, heavy, radiation, treatment, doctors", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Doctors thought Lessya Kotelevskaya had a tumor on her jawbone, and began radiation therapy immediately.
