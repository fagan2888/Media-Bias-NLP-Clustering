But her appointment looks nothing like a doctor\u2019s appointment. Instead of getting one-on-one care, she meets with 12 other Latina immigrants for a group visit.\n\nStudies show group prenatal care leads to better birth outcomes.\n\nThe women meet at a community clinic and first take their own blood pressure, weigh themselves, and write down the results. Then they take turns seeing a midwife in a makeshift exam area in the corner of the room. The midwife checks each baby\u2019s heart rate and talks privately with each woman.\n\nAfterward they all sit in a circle and talk \u2014 in Spanish \u2014 about everything from eating healthy to dealing with domestic problems at home. Finally, there\u2019s group meditation. V\u00e1squez says this is her favorite part.\n\n\u201cIt clears your mind of all the things that are going on around you, going on outside,\u201d she says in Spanish. \u201cIt makes you more relaxed.\u201d\n\nV\u00e1squez, who is from Mexico, says she\u2019s under a lot stress. She lives in a cramped apartment with her husband and his entire family. The group appointments help.\n\nV\u00e1squez and the other women are a part of a prenatal care program known as Centering Pregnancy. Women with similar gestational ages meet, learn about self-care, and have facilitated group discussions.\n\nBetter Outcomes \u2014 for Mom and Baby\n\nStudies show group prenatal care leads to better birth outcomes when compared against standard care. Women who do Centering Pregnancy are more likely to breastfeed, at least initially, and attend prenatal care appointments. They\u2019re less likely to have postpartum depression and preterm births.\n\nAnd there\u2019s another benefit \u2014 Centering Pregnancy is linked to fewer caesarean sections \u2014 and that saves taxpayer Medicaid dollars. For California births without complications, it cost nearly twice as much for c-sections than it does for vaginal births.\n\nMidwife Margy Hutchison started Centering Pregnancy at San Francisco General Hospital 15 years ago \u2014 for people like Irma V\u00e1squez. Hutchison noticed that many of her Latina immigrant patients suffered from chronic stress or depression.\n\n\u201cIt was really clear to me that many of them were really struggling,\u201d Hutchison says. \u201cAnd patients I continue to see are struggling with the impact of social isolation.\u201d\n\nHutchison says she would see these Latina immigrants sitting alone and silent in the hospital\u2019s waiting rooms. She wanted to connect them.\n\n\u201cExperience has shown me certainly that this group of people benefit tremendously from being in group prenatal care,\u201d Hutchison says.\n\nHutchison says many of these women were suffering from stress, social isolation or depression \u2014 which are all linked to preterm births, low birth weight, and damage to children\u2019s cognitive skills. But it was hard to convince the women to do group prenatal care at first.\n\n\u201cIf a woman\u2019s depressed that may be the last thing she wants to do,\u201d Hutchison says. \u201cShe wants to curl up in a ball and stay home.\u201d\n\nThat was the case for Karent Novela, a Mexican immigrant who moved to San Francisco a year before she became pregnant. Novela didn\u2019t speak English, and her only family here \u2013her husband \u2014 works 12 hours a day. She was depressed and not in the mood to hang out with other women.\n\nIn addition, S.F. General\u2019s Centering Pregnancy program is run by midwives, and that scared Novela. She had seen a midwife, one without medical credentials, back in Mexico a year earlier, and she had had a miscarriage. Now in the U.S., she wanted to see a doctor.\n\n\u201cWhen they told me about midwifes, my first thought was, \u2018Midwives, that\u2019s what we call in Mexico, parteras,\u2019\u201d says Novela. \u201cParteras are like the same in Mexico, but without any degrees or studies, just by their basic knowledge they deliver babies. So I just said, \u2018No!\u2019\u201d\n\nBut the nurses at S.F. General were persistent. They assured her that their midwives are trained professionals.\n\n\u201cThe nurse that was with me, she told me, \u2018You might try it. If you like it, you can stay. If you don\u2019t like it you can just keep coming to your appointments with your doctor. But you decide. It\u2019s your decision.\u201d\n\nNovela signed up. She loved it.\n\n\u201cHaving people who speak my language, and having people who are from my same background \u2014 like, they don\u2019t have family \u2014 that changed me. It changed my life.\u201d\n\nChoosing Centering Pregnancy over Traditional Care\n\nNovela isn\u2019t alone. Most Latina midwifery patients at S.F. General are now choosing Centering Pregnancy over one-on-one care \u2014 and 95 percent of these women say they would do it again with future pregnancies. Internal hospital data show that Centering Pregnancy patients are more like to attend prenatal care appointments than midwifery patients who get traditional care.\n\nLaurie Jurkiewicz is a midwife at S.F. General who runs Centering Pregnancy groups in Spanish. She says some U.S. hospitals hesitated at first to launch Centering Pregnancy programs \u2014 mostly because, like S.F. General, they weren\u2019t set up for group prenatal care.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s out-of-the box thinking, right?\u201d says Jurkiewicz. \u201cAnd so our struggle was we\u2019d get a room, and we\u2019d get kicked out of a room at the last minute, and the rooms weren\u2019t very nice.\u201d\n\nS.F. General got the program off the ground by partnering with community clinics and using their space for these group appointments. Other hospitals are now doing the same or partnering with churches for meeting space.\n\nJurkiewicz says the partnerships have allowed Centering Pregnancy to flourish at S.F. General. When they first created the program in 1999, it was the only one like it on the West Coast. Today, there are 21 Centering Pregnancy programs in California alone \u2014 mostly in California public hospitals where nearly half the patients are Latino. It\u2019s also growing nationwide, especially among high-risk, low-income populations.\n\nKarent Novela, the Mexican immigrant, says she\u2019s built a community with the other Latina immigrants from her Centering Pregnancy group. They now call each other for support.\n\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t have family, they didn\u2019t have friends, and most of them had their first baby like me,\u201d says Novela. \u201cSo I just feel like, OK, I\u2019m not the only one who is having these difficulties. I\u2019m not the only one who is suffering for this. My way of seeing my situation changed. So I start to change.\u201d\n\nNovela says Centering Pregnancy shook things up in her life and pulled her out of her out of her depression. And that, she says, empowered her to be a better mom.\n\nClarification: The open in the radio piece above suggests that Centering Pregnancy was founded at S.F. General Hospital. But S.F. General was the first hospital on the west coast to offer the program.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The core of the Centering Pregnancy model is medical care, education and support -- in a group setting.", "contextly-page": "{\"title\":\"Low-Income Latinas Turn to Group Visits for Prenatal Care\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/2014\\/06\\/18\\/in-san-francisco-centering-pregnancy-outside-the-box-prenatal-care\\/\",\"pub_date\":\"2014-06-18 05:55:27\",\"mod_date\":\"2014-06-19 15:18:07\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":19560,\"author_id\":\"46\",\"author_name\":\"Shuka Kalantari\",\"author_display_name\":\"Shuka Kalantari\",\"tags\":[\"Childbirth\",\"Pregnancy\",\"Science\"],\"categories\":[\"Community Health\",\"Policy\"],\"image\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/sites\\/27\\/2014\\/06\\/RS10646_016-hpf.jpg\"}", "og": {"site_name": "State of Health", "description": "The core of the Centering Pregnancy model is medical care, education and support -- in a group setting.", "title": "Low-Income Latinas Turn to Group Visits for Prenatal Care", "url": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/2014/06/18/in-san-francisco-centering-pregnancy-outside-the-box-prenatal-care/", "image": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/wp-content/uploads/sites/27/2014/06/RS10640_010-hpf-300x200.jpg", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@kqedhealth", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@"}, "fb": {"app_id": 160023622793}, "keywords": "childbirth,pregnancy,science", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2abe\"", "article_summary": "Better Outcomes \u2014 for Mom and BabyStudies show group prenatal care leads to better birth outcomes when compared against standard care.\n\u201cExperience has shown me certainly that this group of people benefit tremendously from being in group prenatal care,\u201d Hutchison says.\nStudies show group prenatal care leads to better birth outcomes.\nInternal hospital data show that Centering Pregnancy patients are more like to attend prenatal care appointments than midwifery patients who get traditional care.\nBut it was hard to convince the women to do group prenatal care at first."}
