Dana Bash of CNN called it \u201clow-energy.\u201d One thing it was not was accurate\u2013or honest. Here are Obama\u2019s top ten lies, in chronological order.\n\n1. \u201c[W]e\u2019ve done all this while cutting our deficits by almost three-quarters.\u201d This is pure fiction. Obama has doubled the national debt, and it\u2019s not because he cut the deficit. Rather, he spent staggering amounts of money in his first months in office\u2013which he assigns, dishonestly, to the previous fiscal year, under George W. Bush. He \u201ccut\u201d (i.e. spent more gradually) from that spending, but only under protest, after Republicans took the House in 2010.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\n(Update: It is true that Obama\u2019s 2015 budget deficit was about 25% of his 2010 deficit. But he referred to \u201cdeficits,\u201d plural. Until last year, all of Obama\u2019s deficits were worse than all of Bush\u2019s deficits except for the last two.)\n\n2. \u201cAnyone claiming that America\u2019s economy is in decline is peddling fiction.\u201d With that line, Obama took a shot at his would-be Democratic successors, as well as his Republican critics. But the truth is that despite the slow recovery\u2013the slowest since World War II\u2013labor force participation is the lowest it has been in decades. Wages are stagnant, household incomes still have not recovered from the recession, and young people see a bleak future.\n\n3. \u201cThat\u2019s what the Affordable Care Act is all about. It\u2019s about filling the gaps in employer-based care so that when we lose a job, or go back to school, or start that new business, we\u2019ll still have coverage.\u201dThat is a cruel joke, given that Obamacare canceled insurance coverage for millions of Americans who did not change jobs. It also raised deductibles and premiums so high that many insurance companies are leaving the Obama exchanges totally.\n\n4. \u201cFood Stamp recipients didn\u2019t cause the financial crisis; recklessness on Wall Street did.\u201d Actually, food stamp recipients, metaphorically speaking, were indirectly responsible\u2013as well as Wall Street sharks. Obama leaves out the government\u2019s role, under the Community Reinvestment Act, in pushing mortgages on people who could not afford them, and in backing the derivatives based on those mortgages that ultimately burst the whole bubble.\n\n5. \u201cWe\u2019ve protected an open internet\u2026\u201d. Obama\u2019s policy of Net Neutrality has turned Internet service providers into public utilities under an ancient regulatory regime. The result has been a sharp decline in broadband investment and a much less free and open system. In addition, the Obama administration is rushing to shift control of ICANN to the international community, which will ensure that the Internet is less free, and subject to overseas censorship.\n\n6. \u201cSeven years ago, we made the single biggest investment in clean energy in our history. Here are the results.\u201d It is laughable that Obama would claim his failed clean energy spending\u2013think Solyndra\u2013led to the fracking-fed energy boom we have enjoyed for the past several years, especially when the administration did all it could to stop oil and gas development. He also nixed the Keystone pipeline and started a plan to kill coal plants.\n\n7. \u201cNo nation dares to attack us or our allies because they know that\u2019s the path to ruin.\u201d Of all the lies in Obama\u2019s speech, this was undoubtedly the worst, coming hours after Iran seized two U.S. Navy boats and ten sailors. Obama did not even mention those Americans in captivity at any point in his speech, declining the chance to reassure the nation that they would come home safely. It is an omission that will define this address in history.\n\n8. \u201cAs someone who begins every day with an intelligence briefing, I know this is a dangerous time.\u201d Obama does not attend most of his daily intelligence briefings, preferring instead to read intelligence reports\u2013so he claims\u2013on his iPad, a stark contrast to the attentive approach of his predecessor. Late last year, even as Obama claimed that there was little risk from attack, radical Islamic terrorists carried out brutal attacks in Paris and in San Bernardino.\n\n9. \u201cWe are training, arming, and supporting forces who are steadily reclaiming territory in Iraq and Syria [from Islamic State].\u201d The Obama administration\u2019s attempt to train and arm Syrian rebels has been a disaster. Belatedly, the administration has helped Kurdish peshmerga forces, and the Iraqi military has made gains lately, but Obama has not made a serious effort to defeat the Islamic State, and is even giving up on regime change in Syria.\n\n10. \u201cFifty years of isolating Cuba had failed to promote democracy, setting us back in Latin America.\u201d And a year of appeasement has not promoted democracy, either. The Castros remain firmly in power, and we are not helping the opposition. Worse, the Cuban regime continues to arrest thousands of political dissidents, to cozy up to enemies like Iran and North Korea, and to carry out provocative acts\u2013such as stealing a U.S. Hellfire missile.\n\nTowards the end of his speech, Obama told one important truth: \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt a president with the gifts of Lincoln or Roosevelt might have better bridged the divide\u2026\u201d.\n\nAn unusual, but overdue, admission of guilt.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Here are the top ten lies in\u00a0President Barack Obama final State of the Union address, in chronological order.", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Here are the top ten lies in\u00a0President Barack Obama final State of the Union address, in chronological order.", "title": "Fact Check: Top 10 Lies in Obama's State of the Union - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 1280, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2016/01/Obama-SOTU-2016-Chip-Somodevilla-Getty.jpg", "height": 960}, "updated_time": "2016-01-12T20:09:15-07:00", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/01/12/fact-check-state-of-the-union-2016/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Here are the top ten lies in\u00a0President Barack Obama final State of the Union address, in chronological order.", "creator": "@joelpollak", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2016/01/Obama-SOTU-2016-Chip-Somodevilla-Getty.jpg", "title": "Fact Check: Top 10 Lies in Obama's State of the Union - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Fact Check, lies, State of the Union,Big Government,State of the Union", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "published_time": "2016-01-12T19:17:17-07:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/joelpollak", "section": "Big Government", "modified_time": "2016-01-12T20:09:15-07:00", "tag": "State of the Union", "categories": "Big Government"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "Until last year, all of Obama\u2019s deficits were worse than all of Bush\u2019s deficits except for the last two.)\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERPresident Barack Obama promised his final State of the Union address would be short.\nTowards the end of his speech, Obama told one important truth: \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt a president with the gifts of Lincoln or Roosevelt might have better bridged the divide\u2026\u201d.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER(Update: It is true that Obama\u2019s 2015 budget deficit was about 25% of his 2010 deficit.\n\u201cNo nation dares to attack us or our allies because they know that\u2019s the path to ruin.\u201d Of all the lies in Obama\u2019s speech, this was undoubtedly the worst, coming hours after Iran seized two U.S. Navy boats and ten sailors."}
