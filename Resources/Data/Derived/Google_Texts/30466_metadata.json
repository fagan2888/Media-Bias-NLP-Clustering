High-profile supporters like Ellen Degeneres, Alicia Silverstone, Pam Anderson and Russell Simmons are even joining the mix. Adding their voices to the throngs of people who are trying to prove that Mickey D\u2019s could have a new market in pursuing a vegetarian dining option.\n\nChipotle, Burger King, Subway, Denny\u2019s and Starbucks are among those restaurant chains that have taken a cue from vegetarian diners seeking greater options among fast food restaurants. The move, should McDonald\u2019s pursue it, is not far-fetched as veggie burgers and wraps with hummus and beans are already sold at its Indian and Canadian locations.\n\nWhile vegetarians and vegans can already customize their orders with meatless options, the petitioners claim that\u2019s not enough, and that salad options aren\u2019t particularly filling.\n\nThere\u2019s no telling in whether McDonald\u2019s will heed the desires of the petitioners, but for now, a spokeswoman for the nation\u2019s 111th largest company said: \u201cIn our experience, menu items at McDonald\u2019s are most successful when enough customers choose to select them. It allows us to ensure freshness of ingredients and overall quality of the food item. We\u2019ll continue to evolve our menu to meet the changing preferences of our customers.\u201d\n\nThis latest ploy to modify the menu may provide the kind of boost McDonald\u2019s is looking for.\n\nThe fast food chain, with 35,000 stores in 100 locations globally, is facing declining sales and profits. The answer: according to Tim Fenton, McDonald\u2019s COO, they intend to step up efforts to be more productive, efficient and relevant to the customers that frequent the giant.\n\nOne of the ways to maintain relevance, some might argue, would be to capitalize on national efforts at promoting more health-conscious lifestyles. From the First Lady\u2019s Let\u2019s Move Campaign, to the roll out of the Affordable Care Act, and efforts by employers across the country to focus on wellness and preventive care, adding more healthy options could really inure to McDonald\u2019s benefit.\n\nA vegetarian option might also assist the company is providing healthier, more affordable food choices to members of low-income and economically underserved communities. In cities across the country, McDonald\u2019s is easier to access than a grocery store. By providing different vegetarian options, in addition to its salads, the brand could gain real accolades for introducing vegetable-based options into the diets of people who typically can\u2019t afford to \u201ceat better.\u201d Time will tell whether McDonald\u2019s will bring back the veggie burger, but if it does, it could be a step in the right direction.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The fast food giant known for its Big Mac and the ability to \u201cturn frowns upside down\u201d may soon have an answer to diminishing profits and declining consumer", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "author": "Kristal High", "og": {"image": "http://politic365.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2014/02/mcdonalds-veggiburger.jpg"}, "robots": "index,follow,noodp,noydir", "keywords": "alicia silverstone,ellen degeneres,healthy food,healthy mcdonalds,mcdonalds,veggie burgers,Culture,News", "google-site-verification": "_JwiWIkiEZ4HQvBexdo_s_SK6wnFW7XjgHXUAzGaBt4", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda181\"", "article_summary": "The fast food chain, with 35,000 stores in 100 locations globally, is facing declining sales and profits.\nA Change.org petition that\u2019s garnered nearly 90,000 signatures is asking McDonald\u2019s to add a plant-based protein option to its mealtime line up.\nChipotle, Burger King, Subway, Denny\u2019s and Starbucks are among those restaurant chains that have taken a cue from vegetarian diners seeking greater options among fast food restaurants.\nIn cities across the country, McDonald\u2019s is easier to access than a grocery store.\nThe answer: according to Tim Fenton, McDonald\u2019s COO, they intend to step up efforts to be more productive, efficient and relevant to the customers that frequent the giant."}
