The site has come to exemplify maker culture, with its emphasis on innovation, learning, and sharing. So when a large corporation begins using the site as an advertising gimmick, it\u2019s no surprise that several members of the community would be a bit hacked off.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t help when that company is one as controversial as Papa John\u2019s, which has made several rather dubious headlines for incidents such as its multimillionaire CEO\u2019s threat to cut employee hours to pay for health care if Obamacare wasn\u2019t repealed. That incident in particular has made the company a poster child, in many circles, for the hypocrisy and unfairness of corporate culture. A revulsion towards the practices of major corporations is one reason that many have turned so enthusiastically to the maker movement, choosing to provide for themselves and support the work of individuals rather than throwing their money at soulless megacorporations. So it\u2019s safe to say that Papa John\u2019s debut on Thingiverse feels like an unwelcome invasion to many.\n\nIn fairness, the pizza company\u2019s new Thingiverse page is pretty innocuous, with a few pizza-themed Christmas ornaments the only items displayed so far. But it\u2019s the principle that has some makers fuming. A Reddit forum entitled \u201cWill using thingiverse as a form of advertising become a thing?\u201d voices the question that worries many: will Thingiverse eventually be taken over by the corporate culture it has distanced itself from?\n\nPersonally, I don\u2019t think so. One of the main points of Thingiverse is that everything is free and open source; I can\u2019t see McDonalds expending a ton of effort on designing things that won\u2019t directly make money and that can\u2019t be trademarked. Sure, it\u2019s annoying to see a corporation using a site like Thingiverse for advertising purposes, but it\u2019s really no more than a gimmick. Most users on the Reddit thread seem to agree, and a few even put a positive spin on it.\n\n\u201cIf they\u2019re giving the files away for free, what\u2019s the harm? Sure, you might be some \u2018stupid\u2019 things, but every so often you\u2019ll get some really cool designs,\u201d commented a user by the name of classic_schmosby. \u201cThink of it this way, too: this gave one or more people a job. If more companies do this, it will create more jobs in 3d modeling, which also should make more tinkerers in 3d modeling.\u201d\n\nOther users seemed to see Papa Johns\u2019 entry into the Thingiverse community as a challenge, and suggested taking advantage of the open source format to add some, er, creative touches to the designs the corporation has offered. That\u2019s certainly one way to dissuade corporations from using a free creative space as an advertising opportunity. Papa John, you may have created a monster. What are your thoughts on this move?
