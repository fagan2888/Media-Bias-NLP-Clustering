(Dec. 29, 2014)-- A debate over religious freedom is set to take over the Statehouse when the new session begins next week.\n\nState Sen. Scott Schneider (R-Indianapolis) said he\u2019ll introduce his Religious Freedom Restoration Act.\n\nSupporters point to the Hobby Lobby case as a prime example, when the U.S. Supreme Court ruled family-owned corporations don\u2019t have to cover contraception under the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cThis bill, which I plan to author this session, would match federal law in the state of Indiana,\u201d Schneider said in a statement to FOX59. \u201cThe language of the measure is still being finalized.\u201d\n\nCritics, though, are quick to question how far the bill will extend, like allowing small businesses to refuse service to gay couples.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s obviously discriminatory against, like I said, any group,\u201d Chris Paulsen said, president of Indiana Equality Action. \u201cAnd that\u2019s the way it will be used is in a discriminatory manner, even if Sen. Schneider doesn\u2019t mean it that way.\u201d\n\nMicah Clark, director of the American Family Association of Indiana, said 19 other states have passed similar laws.\n\n\u201cWe believe there\u2019s discrimination against people of faith that\u2019s occurring,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have to balance that out, and I think there\u2019s this conflict right now between people of faith and certain government actions that we\u2019re trying to prohibit with this law.\u201d\n\nNeither supporters nor opponents are surprised such a proposal is in the works, given an increased number of gay marriage rulings nationwide.\n\n\u201cThe point is when you have this type of law, you don\u2019t know what the implications are,\u201d said Ken Falk with the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Indiana. \u201cAnd in fact if you look at the Hobby Lobby case and you look at the dissent, the dissent is saying this is opening up Pandora \u2019s Box of people stepping forward and saying I don\u2019t want to do this because of my religious beliefs.\u201d\n\nSchneider said the bill would match the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, signed by President Bill Clinton in 1993.\n\n\u201cI think all along there has been a growing concern among our supporters that religious liberties are under attack, and there is more and more hostility toward it,\u201d Clark said.\n\nCritics said they\u2019ll be watching closely.\n\n\u201cI think it will be a lot of time wasted on something that most Hoosiers don\u2019t want,\u201d Paulsen said.\n\nThe new legislative session begins on January 6.", "article_metadata": {"description": "INDIANAPOLIS, Ind.
