He doesn\u2019t love you. And he doesn\u2019t love me. He wasn\u2019t brought up the way you were brought up and I was brought up through love of this country\u2026. With all our flaws, we\u2019re the most exceptional country in the world.\u201d\n\nThat is Rudy Giuliani, New York\u2019s former mayor, speaking at a Republican dinner in Manhattan earlier this month. Many readers will recognize these now-infamous remarks.\n\nHere is Jeb Bush, the all-but-certain Republican candidate in 2016, speaking to the Chicago Council on Global Affairs a few hours earlier:\n\n\u201cAmerica does not have the luxury of withdrawing from the world. Our security, our prosperity and our values demand that we remain engaged and involved in often distant places. We have no reason to apologize for our leadership and our interest in serving the cause of global security, global peace and human freedom.\u201d\n\nAnd here is President Obama, introducing his administration\u2019s 2015 National Security Strategy , an annual announcement as to how America\u2019s defense and foreign policy cliques intend to get us through the year:\n\n\u201cAny successful strategy to ensure the safety of the American people and advance our national security interests must begin with an undeniable truth\u2014America must lead. Strong and sustained American leadership is essential to a rules-based international order that promotes global security and prosperity as well as the dignity and human rights of all peoples. The question is never whether America should lead, but how we lead.\u201d\n\nThere it is, readers. You have your lumpen rightists, who have acquired more power than seemed possible a few years ago but still face the knotty problem of stupidity. You have your mainstream rightists, polished and clever, intent on staying the expansionist course and persuading us it is best for all. On the foreign policy side, these people remain the right\u2019s true center of gravity.\n\nAnd you have your neoliberals, ever dressing up the rightists\u2019 agenda as the progressive thing to pursue. This, the Williams-Sonoma crowd, is possessed of an egregious righteousness. They are the heirs of the Cold War liberals, those gutless many who assumed whatever shape necessary to avoid confronting American paranoia, reaction and aggression, usually out of sheer self-interest.\n\nThese are the alternatives before us as we look to a presidential campaign and a new administration. It is an interesting choice. We can have exceptionalism, exceptionalism or exceptionalism. One cannot wait to vote.\n\nOne cannot wait for the media to wring fantastic distinctions out of the field of candidates for the 2016 presidency. How awful it must have been for those condemned to life in one-party states until freed through our leaders\u2019 commitment to spreading liberty and \u201chuman freedom\u201d everywhere.\n\nWe live through a significant passage in American history. This bears only brief explanation.\n\nChosen-people consciousness arose in England prior to the 17th century crossings. It was a belief, never a thought. There are those who still profess to believe, but the belief long ago passed into the sphere of mythologies. There exceptionalism remained, I would say until September 11, 2001.\n\nThe airborne attacks in New York and Washington revealed the myth as myth. The astonishingly abrupt revelation that Americans are exceptions to nothing was the primary reason that day so shocked most of us.\n\nSince then the wheel turns again: The myth is now two things. It has hardened into an ideology, and it is something closer to a psychological disorder, whereby the leadership\u2014which has most to lose from the collapse of the exceptionalist version of history, not you and I\u2014incessantly insists on the efficacy of the idea in the face of all evidence.\n\nThis is how I read our moment. An exhausted mythology is finally overwhelmed by new realities as the entire world beyond American shores presents them, with exceptions such as Britain, Australia and Israel.\n\nThe American leadership faced a choice in 2001: It could re-imagine the nation\u2019s place in the global community or eschew all imagination in favor of holding to the past. The choice was on the table briefly but proved too stark. The job of thinking lost to the job of believing. Rudy Giuliani, Jeb Bush and President Obama merely articulate the standing preference among the powerful.\n\nEach of these three have something to tell us. Let\u2019s consider these lessons one at a time.\n\n*\n\nGiuliani was named \u201cAmerica\u2019s mayor\u201d after the 2001 attacks in his city, but the buffoon within was always destined to break the surface, as it has regularly since he stepped aside in late 2001. D.H. Lawrence had a term for this kind of pol. He called them \u201ctemporarily important people.\u201d It is perfect for Rudy.\n\nWhat is Giuliani doing talking about love in public places? This was my first question. The answer is that he does not mean love. His true accusation against Obama was that the president shows signs of ideological deviance. This is dangerous in America\u2014for all of us. Think about it: Every conversation we have now is freighted with semiological signals as to whether or not one is a believer.\n\nGiuliani reminds me of a couple of things. We are not a strong nation at this moment in our story. We are merely powerful\u2014another, lesser thing altogether. The leadership is weak (as in incapable of new thinking) and frightened (as in having no idea of how to face a future that does not look much like the past).\n\nNo general in a uniform, no one in camo fatigues, no senior spook at the NSA, no hyperpatriotic politician with a flag pin on the lapel should be mistaken as strong because he or she recites the exceptionalist catechism. They seek shelter in the past because facing forward in the post-September 11 era is too fearful a prospect.\n\nGiuliani is a blunt instrument, but do not miss this point, either: Not too many of us ask others to pass some kind of love-of-country test, but very many of us, maybe most, are more subtle exceptionalists. Cold War liberals felt called upon to prove their anti-Communist bona fides. Most of us live according to a variant of the same imperative.\n\n*\n\nThe interesting thing about Jeb Bush\u2019s speech in Chicago was what he felt called upon to prove. Most comment has focused on his \u201cI am my own man\u201d effort to distance himself from George W.\u2019s catastrophic foreign policy decisions, notably the Iraq invasion in 2003. Fair enough, one cannot blame him for trying.\n\nMy focus landed on the theme of departure, a policy different from what Washington puts out now. His insistence on the new was partly an early rendition of campaign stumping, O.K., but Bush implicitly acknowledged the fundamental malfunction of policy, too: We need the new because what we have does not work.\n\nIt turned out, of course, that Bush meant the new in the nothing-new. \u201cGreater global engagement,\u201d one of his core policy principles, does not mean innovating how America addresses the world\u2014identifying root causes of conflict, for instance. It means a stronger NATO and a strategy to defeat \u201cIslamic terrorism\u201d not by diplomatic or any other reasoned means but an effort \u201cto take them out.\u201d (I have always found the use in high places of a phrase that originated among criminals to be telling.)\n\n\u201cOur words and actions must match,\u201d Bush declared. Ah, a return to the Enlightenment ideals we ignore but hollowly profess. Nothing doing. He means when we say we are going to invade or bomb somebody unless, unless, unless, we must make sure we do so.\n\nBeware always when an American leader talks of advancing freedom and liberty abroad, and the point holds with Bush\u2019s notion of \u201cliberty diplomacy.\u201d Sure enough, Bush defined this as a foreign policy that asserts uniquely American notions of individualism, liberty and other such things. \u201cIf we withdraw from the defense of liberty anywhere,\u201d he said, \u201cthe battle eventually comes to us.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Our politicians are selling us fictions dressed up as patriotism.
