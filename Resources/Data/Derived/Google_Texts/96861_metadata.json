As a surprise, his staff decided to hook him up via Skype with his old friend Savannah Guthrie, who has been on maternity leave from the Today show. Things did not go as smoothly as planned.\n\nThe delay on the Skype call was so long that it quickly became impossible for the pair to have anything resembling a coherent conversation.\n\n\u201cCan I call you Mama Guthrie?\u201d Todd asked Guthrie.\n\n\u201cOf course you can,\u201d she responded, about 30 seconds later, after he had already moved on.\n\nThey ended up doing the best with what they had to work with. \u201cI know we have some kooky Skype delay going here,\u201d Guthrie said, regretting that they would not be capable of their usual \u201celectric banter.\u201d But she did wish Todd \u201cgood luck,\u201d saying she couldn\u2019t \u201cthink of anyone better suited to Meet the Press\u201d than him.\n\nAn unexpected live address on ISIS from British Prime Minister David Cameron meant Todd did not get the chance to deliver a proper goodbye to The Daily Rundown at the end of the hour. He will begin his Meet the Press duties on Sunday, September 7.\n\nAfter the show, Todd apologized on Twitter for the awkwardness:\n\nApologies for rough technical glitches for last show, but u have no idea how amazing our crews were in NYC and DC to get us on air.
