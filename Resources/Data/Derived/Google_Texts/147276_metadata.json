Wire them up with electrodes to measure their body\u2019s response to external stimuli, and put headphones on them. Then transmit some variant of the following via those headphones, and measure their response: \u201cIt\u2019s tax season; there are only 10 days left before your return is due.\u201d\n\nI can pretty much guarantee that you\u2019ll be able to pick out the Americans, simply by the magnitude of the response, up to and including the dents in the ceiling.\n\nThe fact is that, as anyone who has ever moved to the US and started filing taxes here after doing so elsewhere can tell you, US tax season is a bona fide nightmare. I\u2019m one of those individuals; having done what had been more complicated taxes in Canada quite easily on my own, I realized that doing even a simple US return on my own wasn\u2019t possible. British friends who moved here marveled over their first Christmas at the way their new acquaintances swapped names of good accountants the way that they might share tips for a great holiday destination or a marvelous new restaurant \u2026 until they themselves encountered their first tax preparation season.\n\nThis tax season, heading into its final days, has been more nightmarish than most. Nor does it seem as if anyone out there is doing anything to assist beleaguered taxpayers who have to cope with it all, and still meet tax filing deadlines.\n\nThe handwriting was on the wall\n\nThe handwriting was on the wall early on. Congress slashed funding to the Internal Revenue Service to the lowest levels since 1998, on an inflation-adjusted basis. Even before that happened, more than a third of customer calls to the agency\u2019s toll-free line went unanswered.\n\nThat happened in a year Congress and the IRS knew was going to be particularly complicated for both the agency and taxpayers when it came to preparing and processing tax returns, thanks to Obamacare.\n\nFor some taxpayers, it will be pretty straightforward: if they get healthcare through their employer, or they\u2019re covered by Medicare, they just check a box. But if you buy your own healthcare, you set off on a little trip through tax preparation hell. There are new forms to fill out, new calculations and some convoluted math, especially if you received a tax credit to pay for that healthcare and then saw your income jump.\n\nThe icing on the cake? Delayed 1095-A forms from state health exchanges, combined with the need for the taxpayers and the IRS to match up and adjust actual and estimated incomes and tweak the subsidy accordingly, are causing delays in processing refunds. And for many Americans \u2013 and for the economy as a whole at this time of year \u2013 refunds are a critical source of income.\n\nThis all points to the real problem: the sheer complexity of the tax preparation process, and the impossibility of navigating it without assistance.\n\nFor those who can\u2019t afford to hire an accountant and pay a few hundred dollars for even a simple return, there are alternatives. The IRS will help out by providing you with free software, if your income is less than $49,000, and its volunteer person-to-person tax preparation services, available if you make less than $53,000 or are over 60 (and all you need is a basic return).\n\nThe IRS\u2019s stretched resources and the need for help to sort through the complexities of the tax filing system, however, mean US taxpayers are particularly vulnerable to a host of unscrupulous business practices employed by storefront tax preparers trying to win taxpayers\u2019 business. True, costly (to taxpayers) refund anticipation loans have thankfully met their demise. But there is still plenty of room for individual tax preparers to take advantage of the confusion and desperation of people trying to make sense of their tax return, and charging them whatever the market will bear.\n\nAnd right now, given what\u2019s happening with the principal rival to those storefront preparers, TurboTax, it may seem to taxpayers that they are being asked to choose between the frying pan and the fire. In February, more than a dozen states identified thousands of cases of potentially fraudulent tax returns used Intuit\u2019s best-selling tax-preparation software, prompting TurboTax to stop e-filing state income tax returns.\n\nTurboTax fiasco\n\nThe problems were identified when taxpayers logged into their TurboTax accounts to prepare and file their returns \u2013 only to discover that someone had hacked into them and already done so, often steering the refunds to a prepaid debit card.\n\nWhile this story has grabbed headlines, it\u2019s not the only instance of TurboTax-related hacking. In mid-February, a woman living near Poughkeepsie, New York discovered that someone had hacked into her TurboTax file and changed the routing number and account number for her bank \u2013 her $8,000 federal income tax was diverted to an account that didn\u2019t belong to her. In 2013, a Wisconsin businessman had his federal tax refund pilfered by hackers in precisely the same manner by which this year\u2019s hackers have siphoned off state refunds, again using TurboTax. He posted on TurboTax\u2019s Facebook page that it took him a year to sort out the mess, including filling out a new (handwritten) 1040 form.\n\n\u201cIt would have been completely different if they would have worked with me, but they didn\u2019t really at all,\u201d he wrote about his experience with TurboTax and Intuit. \u201cThey pretty much said sorry.\u201d\n\nThere are other, more minor problems that TurboTax consumers have griped about. One of the more recent ones was the need for anyone who owned even a single share of stock to pony up for the most expensive version of its software, in order to get access to capital gains calculations that a less costly variant of the product used to offer. TurboTax quickly offered those customers $25 refunds after the product was hit with nearly a thousand one-star reviews on Amazon.com \u2013 although self-employed customers still were stuck paying the full price.\n\nThe fact that it happened at all, however, reminds us that this is a business; taxpayers confronting ever more complex returns, who don\u2019t have or can\u2019t afford accountants, have few alternatives to using these products, regardless of their flaws.\n\nPerhaps most jarring of all is the realization that it doesn\u2019t have to be this way. The idea of return-free filing \u2013 in which the IRS itself prepares a return, as a voluntary alternative to paying for an accountant or using tax preparation software \u2013 has been on the table for decades, and is already up and running in other countries, such as Denmark and Sweden, as reported two years ago by ProPublica and National Public Radio. Believers in this methodology calculate it could save taxpayers $2bn a year in the cost of preparing tax returns \u2013 not to mention 225m hours of our time and a significant measure of stress and our sanity.\n\nOf course, that $2bn would come out of someone\u2019s pocket. Unsurprisingly, Intuit \u2013 one of the major beneficiaries of the current situation \u2013 stopped that from happening, lobbying ferociously. But the goals of Intuit and Turbo Tax aren\u2019t necessarily in either consumers\u2019 interests or the broader public interest, even though they try to portray it that way by presenting themselves as alternatives to accountants.\n\nIntuit\u2019s goal is to keep customers, not to maximize our deductions or even to make the tax preparation process smooth and pain free. (In fact, if they make it easy, we might not keep coming back year after year and upgrading our software; we might be encouraged to go it alone\u2026)\n\nBut if the IRS can find a way to collect taxes more efficiently, and in the process save those taxpayers who opt to use this kind of system money and angst, well, why not?\n\nOf course, the fact remains that given the way the IRS\u2019s budget has been slashed to the bone, the odds that Intuit and TurboTax have anything real to fear on this score appear to be minimal. That\u2019s unfortunate, on a number of fronts.\n\nIt means that there\u2019s less incentive for the manufacturers of the dominant tax preparation software to feel the icy winds of a real competitive threat blowing, galvanizing the companies into delivering better and better value for consumers (and taking whatever steps are required to preserve their security). It also means that there is less incentive, all the way around, to make tax season less of a nightmare for all concerned.\n\nBut hang in there.
