This is just one more way for us to know that our abuse doesn\u2019t matter, that we\u2019re not protected,\u201d Simon said, adding:\n\nAnd now I\u2019m a fearmonger because I\u2019m speaking out about it. I don\u2019t accept it. I\u2019m not. I\u2019m not crying that the sky is falling. This is actually happening. It\u2019s not a pretend thing, I wish it was.\n\nYMCA\n\nMonths before the rules were officially adopted as state policy, the YMCA of Pierce and Kitsap Counties began allowing transgender members to use locker rooms on the basis of gender identity.\n\n\u201cIn April 2015, the YMCA created a policy to demonstrate our commitment to our transgender community,\u201d the organization said in a statement. \u201cAs a community-based non-profit organization, we are committed to reflecting the diverse communities we serve. We also have a foundational commitment to child abuse prevention.\u201d\n\nAt the time, Triller Haver was working as the organization\u2019s communications director. When she heard the plans to go this route, Triller Haver said she was asked to \u201cdraft some talking points.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs a survivor of sexual assault,\u201d Triller Haver said she told her bosses, \u201cI can\u2019t do this.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey gave me two choices,\u201d she said. \u201cI could resign and receive severance for 10 weeks if I kept quiet or I could quit.\u201d\n\n\u201cGuess what I picked.\u201d\n\nAs more members found out about the policy, a storm of backlash ensued. According to the Seattle Times, 300 households canceled their memberships.\n\nIn September, the YMCA decided to scale back its new locker room policies. But by December, they were reinstated.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re following state law,\u201d chief executive Bob Ecklund told The Seattle Times.\n\nBut critics, including Triller Haver, Simon, and Flores, believe the YMCA was doing much more than following the law\u2014they believe the organization was helping to make it.\n\n\u201cThey colluded with the Human Rights Commission,\u201d Triller Haver said, citing documents she saw while working there. \u201cThey spearheaded this effort \u2026 I don\u2019t think they could have done it if they didn\u2019t have a Christian organization championing it for them.\u201d\n\nThe Daily Signal reached out to the YMCA of Pierce and Kitsap Counties for comment. The YMCA did not respond to our request.\n\nTriller Haver and Simon have since canceled their memberships\u2014something that as Christians and longtime volunteers at the organization, they thought they\u2019d never do.\n\nFlores said she intends to do the same, but hasn\u2019t been able to go back.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s painful,\u201d she said.\n\nIn the meantime, Triller Haver, Simon, and Flores have stayed busy organizing a grassroots campaign that includes picketing on sidewalks to pressure the organization into changing their policies.\n\nJill Wade, a mother of two from Spanaway, Wash., is one of the women who joined in on the protests. Just when they thought they were beginning to make progress, the Washington Human Rights Commission applied the rules to all schools and businesses with eight or more employees.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been raising awareness about the YMCA but now at this point, they\u2019re a small fish,\u201d Wade said.\n\nA \u2018Small Fish\u2019 in a Big Sea\n\nThe women are now turning to public officials to plead their case.\n\nAlready, three Washington lawmakers are working on measures that would scale back the rules to different degrees.\n\nSen. Doug Ericksen, a Republican from Bellingham, plans to introduce a \u201csimple\u201d one-paragraph proposal that would repeal the rules drawn up by the Human Rights Commission and ban the commission from taking similar action.\n\n\u201cI believe that when I drop my kids off at school, or when I take them to a private gym, I have a right to expect that the men will use the men\u2019s locker room and the women will use the women\u2019s locker room,\u201d Ericksen told The Daily Signal. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have to worry about my young daughters having to come face to face with things that they should not have to be exposed to at their age.\u201d\n\nA trio of Republicans, Reps. Brad Klippert, Tom Dent and Dan Griffey, introduced a bill that requires that a person\u2019s DNA be used to determine what facilities they are and aren\u2019t allowed to use.\n\nRep. Graham Hunt, a conservative from Orting, Wash., wants to ban anyone from using public facilities opposite from his or her anatomical sex unless that person has undergone sex-reassignment surgery.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve tried to make this about the genitalia,\u201d Hunt told The Daily Signal. \u201cIf you don\u2019t have the parts \u2026 if you don\u2019t have the plumbing, then you don\u2019t go in.\u201d\n\nTriller Haver, Simon and Flores don\u2019t have a preference as to what version the state adopts\u2014they\u2019re just desperate to see a change.\n\nEmotions at Stake\n\nHaving been watched in the shower by her abuser, Triller Haver said it\u2019s been \u201ca gentle, slow process of healing\u201d to use locker rooms again.\n\n\u201cI was a college athlete all growing up and I couldn\u2019t even in college shower with my team,\u201d she said. \u201cSo for me to use a locker room at all, that\u2019s been a gentle, slow process of healing and I feel like that completely got stripped away.\u201d\n\nThe YMCA, Triller Haver added, \u201cwas the first place I did shower in public.\u201d\n\nIn November 2015, Triller Haver authored an emotional blog post in The Federalist about her past abuse and why she believes that allowing transgender women into the women\u2019s locker room poses a serious threat.\n\nLet me be clear,\u201d Triller Haver wrote, adding:\n\nI am not saying that transgender people are predators. Not by a long shot. What I am saying is that there are countless deviant men in this world who will pretend to be transgender as a means of gaining access to the people they want to exploit, namely women and children. It already happens.\n\nFor Flores, who said she was abused inside a locker room when her mom would drop her off for swimming classes, the policies are particularly traumatizing.\n\n\u201cEver since the Y did this, I\u2019ve been waking up sometimes with cramps in my legs and that feeling of terror again,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you were a woman assaulted by a man, it feels extremely unsafe.\u201d\n\nSimon, who used to volunteer for the at Mel Korum YMCA in Puyallup to make sure all volunteers completed training\u2014which included Child Abuse Prevention Training\u2014said she recently experienced her first panic attack in the last decade.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had my first panic attack in 10 years now knowing in my state there are only certain bathrooms that I will be able to enter safely,\u201d she said. \u201cPlaces where children gather are the number one place where pedophiles try to get into.\u201d\n\n\u2018Fearmongers\u2019\n\nSince deciding to speak out, Triller Haver, Simon, and Flores say they\u2019ve been attacked and labeled as \u201cfearmongers.\u201d\n\nBut Simon, who said her abuser went on to attack other girls after her, said she won\u2019t let the insults stop her. \u201cI know the full weight of not speaking out and people getting hurt,\u201dSimon said, adding:\n\nSex abuse is a silent epidemic and you\u2019re silenced because of the shame, the guilt, there\u2019s a lot of manipulation \u2013 that you want it, that it\u2019s your fault. To finally get to the place where I can say I was a little girl that that happened to it there was no shame there was no guilt\u2026That is why so many women stay silent. It\u2019s such a twisting of the soul.\n\nCiting statistics that say less than one percent of the American population is transgender, Flores asked, \u201cWhy are the 99 percent having to change our whole way of doing things for less than one percent?\u201d\n\nTo quell anxieties that she might confront male genitalia in the women\u2019s locker rooms, Triller Haver said she\u2019s been instructed to use \u201cprivate stalls.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf we as survivors have issues, we\u2019re invited to use single occupancy stalls,\u201d she said, adding:\n\nIt feels like you\u2019re saying, \u2018I have to do what you want with my body or I\u2019m a horrible person,\u2019 and that\u2019s a manipulation. I can be a very loving person but I don\u2019t have to shower with you.\n\nSince sharing her story on The Federalist, Triller Haver said she\u2019s heard from \u201chundreds\u201d of other sexual assault victims who share her concerns with the new policies.\n\nBut beyond that, it\u2019s been difficult finding people willing to listen, she said.\n\nLooking down at her 5-year-old daughter playing on the floor, Triller Haver said, \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have to fight so hard to be heard.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "A group of women who were sexually abused at young ages are going public with their stories to fight the state's new bathroom policies.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "A group of women who were sexually abused at young ages are going public with their stories to fight the state's new bathroom policies.", "title": "Sexual Assault Victims on Transgender Bathroom Policies", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/Haver-Cover-012016.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-01-28T09:22:31+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1WCgdaI"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "A group of women who were sexually abused at young ages are going public with their stories to fight the state's new bathroom policies.", "title": "Sexual Assault Victims on Transgender Bathroom Policies", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/Haver-Cover-012016.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Society", "tag": "individual liberty", "published_time": "2016-01-25T03:01:40+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-01-28T09:22:31+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "transgender, bathroom policies, washington, ymca, lgbt, human rights commission, sexual assault"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd23e5\"", "article_summary": "Since sharing her story on The Federalist, Triller Haver said she\u2019s heard from \u201chundreds\u201d of other sexual assault victims who share her concerns with the new policies.\nLet me be clear,\u201d Triller Haver wrote, adding:I am not saying that transgender people are predators.\nLooking down at her 5-year-old daughter playing on the floor, Triller Haver said, \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have to fight so hard to be heard.\u201d\n\u201cThey colluded with the Human Rights Commission,\u201d Triller Haver said, citing documents she saw while working there.\nIn the meantime, Triller Haver, Simon, and Flores have stayed busy organizing a grassroots campaign that includes picketing on sidewalks to pressure the organization into changing their policies."}
