George Pataki (R) said they believe America has lost the sense of power it showed in the wake of the al Qaeda attacks.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cI\u2019m so concerned about [the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria], and al Qaeda and Iran, and the president\u2019s basically kind of state of denial of the dangers that Iran poses to us,\u201d Giuliani said. \u201cIt reminds me of the days before Sept. 11, when we were in a state of denial.\u201d\n\nBoth Giuliani and Pataki, who is running for president, criticized Obama for negotiating with the Iranian leadership, which includes \u201ca mass murderer\u201d and \u201ca madman,\u201d Giuliani said in a reference to Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.\n\nThe U.S., along with several other world powers, recently completed a deal that scales back economic sanctions on Iran in exchange for the Middle Eastern nation limiting its nuclear program.\n\nCritics of the deal argue it won\u2019t prohibit Tehran from developing a nuclear weapon.\n\n\u201cI just feel like somehow somebody\u2019s not reading history,\u201d Giuliani said.\n\n\u201cWe have to completely change our direction in dealing with radical Islamist terrorism,\u201d Pataki added.\n\nAnd that starts with rejecting the Iran deal, Pataki said.\n\n\u201cThis just gives a $100 billion signing bonus to a country that is committed to death to America, death to Israel,\u201d he continued. \u201cIt is an awful, awful agreement that will make Iran the economic and military power in a most troubled part of the world. And it\u2019s incomprehensible that somehow people think this is a good thing.\u201d\n\nSenate Democrats this week blocked the upper chamber from moving forward on a resolution of disapproval of the deal, making it highly unlikely Republicans will be able to dismantle the agreement.\n\nFor both Giuliani and Pataki, the deal is part of a broader theme of an America perceived as weak around the world.\n\n\u201cI think [terrorists] once again believe we\u2019re a country that can be taken advantage of,\u201d Giuliani said. \u201cThe only thing they understand is the exercise of power.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Former mayor Rudy Giuliani and former Gov.
