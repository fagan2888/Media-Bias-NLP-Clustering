As of 2011, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) reports that there are more than 1 million people living with HIV in the United States.\n\nSurprisingly, about one in six is unaware that he or she is HIV positive. The less surprising fact is that about half of new HIV infections are attributed to those who do not know their status.\n\nThe Facts\n\nThe CDC recommends all Americans between the ages of 13 and 64 be tested for HIV as part of routine health care. According to Dr. Stacey Rizza, chair of the HIV clinic at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., every person should have at least one HIV test in his or her lifetime.\n\nThe CDC recommends that all women who are pregnant or planning pregnancy be tested for HIV, and women in high-incidence areas or populations may wish to consider testing again in the third trimester.\n\nIdeally, all patients who enter a health care setting should be asked if they have ever been tested for HIV, and if not, they should be offered testing. The CDC recommends annual testing for people who engage in unprotected sex or share needles and further recommends that sexually active gay and bisexual men may benefit from more frequent testing (every 3 to 6 months).\n\nThere are many reasons to consider having an HIV test. Research has shown that early diagnosis and treatment can improve health, extend life and help to prevent the further spread of HIV. People who are diagnosed early can find proper care and access life-saving treatment before HIV has a chance to cause irreparable damage to the immune system. In fact, exciting new research has shown that people with HIV who take their medication regularly can now hope to live full and healthy lives; they can also reduce the risk of transmitting HIV by as much as 96 percent.\n\nResearch has also shown that people who know their status are likely to take precautions to prevent the spread of HIV.\n\nWhy Aren't People Getting Tested?\n\nDespite the benefits to knowing one's HIV status, many barriers exist to getting tested. According to Dr. Rizza, her research has shown that health care providers in the United States have \u201cnot done a very good job\u201d of following CDC testing recommendations. Only about 60 percent of health care providers in the United States have offered HIV testing to their patients. Many physicians continue to offer testing based on risk factors rather than offering routine testing to all patients as recommended.\n\nNaina Khanna, executive director of the Positive Women\u2019s Network-USA and a woman living with HIV, strongly believes that testing should be universally offered and covered by insurance.\n\n\u201cEither women, or their providers, don\u2019t think they are at risk,\u201d she says. \"I was discouraged from testing twice because they were using a risk-based testing strategy.\u201d According to Khanna, many women get tested late in their HIV infection and many are never offered a test.\n\nAccording to Dr. Rizza, many physicians are uninformed or misinformed about HIV testing recommendations. One of the most common misconceptions regarding HIV testing is that physicians must take time to have a patient sign a consent form. The truth is that most states actually no longer require written consent for HIV testing and a verbal consent is satisfactory.\n\nAnother barrier to increased testing is the lack of coordinated mechanisms in health care settings to test for HIV. Dr. Rizza's research highlights the importance of ensuring that all health care settings and physicians are aware of the CDC recommendations and implementing procedures so more people will have regular access to testing, recommendations for prevention and treatment.\n\nLife After An HIV Diagnosis\n\nCristina Pena is living proof that there is life after an HIV diagnosis. The energetic 29-year-old, who is about to complete her master\u2019s degree in health policy from University of California at Berkeley, was born HIV positive. As an ambassador for the Greater than AIDS Empowered campaign, she hopes to encourage women to take control of their own health and get tested.\n\n\u201cWe need to turn testing into something that is a routine part of our lives, like going to the dentist or [women\u2019s heath] appointments,\u201d says Pena. She continues: \u201cOf course, it\u2019s best to protect yourself against HIV, but your life doesn\u2019t have to end if you have an HIV diagnosis. It is important to know that there are many resources available to help you if you do test positive.\u201d\n\nPena admits that a life without HIV would be easier, but adds: \u201cI love my life. Yes, HIV makes things more complicated but regardless we can still have fulfilling and rewarding lives. We can go to school, have careers and families. Living with HIV should not remain as silent as it has.\u201d\n\nBreaking Down Barriers\n\nWhile research on patient acceptance of HIV testing varies, some data suggests that patients may feel uncomfortable asking for or taking an HIV test. Many patients fear stigma associated with the disease if they test positive and worry that frequent tests may affect their insurance rating.\n\nThere is also a large group of patients that do indeed want to be tested for HIV; however, they believe they received a test as part of routine care when, in fact, they have not.\n\nDarryl Cannady, executive director of South Central Development Center in Bluefield, W.V., offers rapid HIV testing as part of his regular programming. However, there are many barriers to reaching the community.\n\n\u201cThere is a stigma attached to HIV and sex in general in rural areas,\u201d says Cannady. \u201cWithout education people don\u2019t know they are at risk.\u201d Cannady says that \u201climited and non-existent\u201d resources for HIV education make it difficult to engage in meaningful grassroots outreach to residents and health care providers to dispel existing myths about HIV.\n\nOver the years, the United States has had some success with a number of testing initiatives that aim to reduce the number of people who are unaware of their status.\n\nAccording to a recent CDC analysis, the proportion of adults who had ever been tested for HIV increased from 37 percent in 2000 to 45 percent in 2010. Although more Americans than ever before are getting HIV tests, the number of new diagnoses has remained relatively unchanged.\n\nKhanna is hoping that the move to routine testing, which has allowed reimbursement for HIV testing, will help to improve the number of people choosing to have an HIV test. Additionally, linkage to care will likely be improved through the Affordable Care Act and provision of health insurance to people who have not qualified in the past.\n\nIn addition to government testing initiatives, community-based grassroots organizations and private industry also organize, sponsor and support HIV testing. One such program is the Greater than AIDS \u201cI Got Tested\u201d campaign, a program of the Kaiser Family Foundation and the Black AIDS Institute. According to Tina Hoff, the Kaiser Family Foundation\u2019s director of health communications and media partnerships, this education and testing campaign is \u201call about unity.\u201d\n\n\u201cI Got Tested\u201d offers local communities an opportunity to be part of a broad, national campaign for HIV awareness and testing. As part of the effort, Greater Than AIDS and Walgreens are teaming up with health departments and local AIDS organizations to provide FREE HIV testing at more than 250 Walgreens stores from June 26 to June 28 to coincide with National HIV Testing Day on June 27.\n\nGreater Than AIDS partnership with Walgreens began in 2011 and has continued to grow significantly each year.\n\n\u201cIn the first year, we were in nine cities, 24 stores and we performed more than 800 tests,\u201d says Hoff. \u201cThis year, we will be in at least 100 cities, 250 stores and we hope to conduct 8,000 tests.\u201d\n\n\u201cTests are provided free of charge by trained and certified testers,\u201d she continues. \u201cWe ensure that each store has a suitable space to perform confidential testing and counselling.\u201d\n\nProviding tests in the local community drug store helps to normalize HIV testing. For Hoff, it is not just about the number of tests performed but more about the number of people that can be reached to help reduce stigma and plant a seed for future testing.\n\nThe Final Word: Know Your Status\n\nDerrick Jordan agrees. Now 37, Jordan lost one of his best friends to AIDS at the young age of 19.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t find out until after he became sick,\u201d says Jordan. \u201cAbout four months later he died and I was carrying his casket.\u201d It was this defining moment in Jordan\u2019s life that led him to become an ambassador for the \u201cI Got Tested\u201d campaign. Jordan says that HIV should be an \u201copen topic\u201d and that people shouldn\u2019t be afraid to talk about sex.\n\nAccording to Jordan, most friends from his home state of Mississippi don\u2019t get tested.\n\n\u201cI think it is fear,\u201d he says. \u201cIt is easier to live under the auspices that they are OK.\u201d\n\nHe adds that stigma is also a barrier to testing: \u201cTen years ago they just automatically assumed you were gay, or on the DL (down low) and that, in and of itself, is a taboo.\u201d\n\nJordan has been tested five times since his friend died.\n\n\u201cI had a test last December,\u201d he says. \u201cI was scared to see my own results, but I did it. And the next time I might be scared again, but I don\u2019t think that fear should keep you from getting tested. \u201c\n\nIn his new home of Atlanta, he says, \u201cthe atmosphere is different and gay life is celebrated, not frowned upon.\u201d Jordan believes that this acceptance has led more people, regardless of sexual orientation, to get tested.\n\nAs for his role as an \u201cI Got Tested\u201d ambassador, he says, \u201cSome people see my face on the posters and assume I have HIV or that I am gay.\u201d\n\nWhile it bothered him at first that people would make incorrect assumptions about his HIV status or sexuality, Jordan addresses the issue with confidence:\n\n\u201cI have been tested and I know that I don\u2019t have HIV. Do you know your status?\u201d\n\nResources:\n\nGreaterThan.org/Walgreens\n\nPWN-USA\n\nCDC National AIDS Hotline:\n\n1-800-342-2437 (English)\n\n1-800-344-7432 (Spanish)\n\n1-800-243-7889 (TTY/deaf access)\n\nThis article has been updated to reflect that Dr. Stacey Rizza is based in Rochester, Minn., not Rochester, N.Y.
