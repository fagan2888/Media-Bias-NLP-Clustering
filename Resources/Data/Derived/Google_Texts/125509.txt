So many performers have committed to appear in the “Saturday Night Live” 40th anniversary special that it might be easier to list the folks who aren’t showing up for the reunion.

Meanwhile, it’s worth noting that NBC’s “Saturday Night Live” outlasted ABC’s “Saturday Night Live” by 39 seasons.

Howard Cosell began hosting a variety show called “Saturday Night Live” in September of 1975 -- one month before NBC debuted its Saturday Night sketch comedy show.

ABC’s “SNL” lasted one season, getting the hatchet after 18 episodes. Director Don Mischer, in an American Archive of Television interview, called it one of the greatest disasters in television history.

It was TV’s Titanic? If so, some impressive folks were on board. Bill Murray was part of the cast and so was his brother, Brian Doyle-Murray. According to imdb.com, among people who appeared on the Cosell show were Billy Crystal, Paul Anka, Bill Cosby, John Denver, Roberta Flack, Barry Manilow, Joe Namath, Ted Kennedy and Tulsa’s Roy Clark. Don’t forget the Bay City Rollers, who had a perfect song for the show.
