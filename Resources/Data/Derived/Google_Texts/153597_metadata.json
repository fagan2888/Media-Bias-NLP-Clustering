Morgan Securities, Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., Pierce, Fenner & Smith and Merrill Lynch among its underwriters, according to Reuters.\n\nThis is TransUnion\u2019s second attempt to go public. It withdrew a bid in 2011 after being acquired by Advent International and Goldman Sachs.\n\nWith an initial fundraising target of $100 million, and previous reports that TransUnion intends to raise $800 million this year through its IPO, this move makes the agency the last of the big three to go public. Equifax joined the New York Stock Exchange in 1971, and Experian joined the London Stock Exchange in 2006.\n\nGoing public means a company gives up a certain amount of freedom; while its valuation and investment can shoot up, so can the pressure investors can place on the company\u2019s operations and processes. Trans-Union reported a revenue net loss of 10 percent, or $12.5 million, last year, down from $35.1 million the year before, per Reuters.\n\nWith the IPO filed with U.S. regulators, speculation has begun about ways the company\u2019s focus will shift in coming years. For example, the research firm IDC expects TransUnion\u2019s investment in big data to increase 15 percent by 2018.\n\nTransUnion has been in the news recently for a number of consumer-based milestones. First, the bureau announced that CreditVision, its 18-month-old creditworthiness predictor, helped score 26.5 million consumers who previously lacked credit scores, while also increasing the number of people categorized as super-prime.\n\nThen news broke that the three credit bureaus had come to an agreement with New York state to resolve credit disputes themselves, rather than through lenders.\n\nWith potentially adjusted business priorities, a slew of new investors to come and a large increase in funds raised, it\u2019s not a reach to argue that this move could affect consumers.\n\nChristina Lavingia,\n\nGOBankingRates.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "Going public means that a company gives up a certain amount of freedom.", "og": {"description": "Going public means that a company gives up a certain amount of freedom.", "title": "How TransUnion\u2019s IPO could affect your credit score", "url": "http://www.dallasnews.com/business/personal-finance/headlines/20150412-how-transunions-ipo-could-affect-your-credit-score.ece", "image": {"width": 345, "identifier": "http://www.dallasnews.com/resrsc/images/facebook-default.jpg", "height": 345}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "type": "article"}, "LastModifiedDate": "2015-04-15T23:56:28Z", "twitter": {"site": "@dallasnews", "card": "summary", "creator": "@dallasnews"}, "PublishDate": "2015-04-13T03:11:57Z", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"How TransUnion\\u2019s IPO could affect your credit score\", \"link\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/business/personal-finance/headlines/20150412-how-transunions-ipo-could-affect-your-credit-score.ece\", \"image_url\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/resrsc/images/facebook-default.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"2254831\", \"pub_date\": \"2015-04-13T03:11:57Z\", \"section\": \"Economy & You Headlines\", \"author\": \"\", \"tags\": [\"dallas\", \"dallas fort worth\", \"dallas news\", \"dallas fort worth news\", \"dfw news\", \"dallas local news\", \"dallas fort worth local news\", \"dallas newspaper\", \"dallas morning news\", \"dallas morning news newspaper\"]}", "fb": {"admins": 1043783589, "page_id": 20946638799, "app_id": 258290334265148}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "cXenseParse": {"recs": {"image": "http://www.dallasnews.com/resrsc/images/facebook-default.jpg", "publishtime": "2015-04-13T03:11:57Z"}}, "news_keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper"}, "article_summary": "Equifax joined the New York Stock Exchange in 1971, and Experian joined the London Stock Exchange in 2006.\nThen news broke that the three credit bureaus had come to an agreement with New York state to resolve credit disputes themselves, rather than through lenders.\nWith the IPO filed with U.S. regulators, speculation has begun about ways the company\u2019s focus will shift in coming years.\nFor example, the research firm IDC expects TransUnion\u2019s investment in big data to increase 15 percent by 2018.\nFirst, the bureau announced that CreditVision, its 18-month-old creditworthiness predictor, helped score 26.5 million consumers who previously lacked credit scores, while also increasing the number of people categorized as super-prime."}
