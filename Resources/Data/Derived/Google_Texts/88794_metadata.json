Ted Cruz convened a subcommittee hearing Tuesday to dispute the validity of research from climate \u201calarmists,\u201d whose findings have become central to crafting environmental policy.\n\nCruz used his opening remarks to detail the 2013 expedition where a ship of 74 people sent into Antarctica to research climate change got stuck in ice, forcing an airlift rescue a week later.\n\n\u201cThis expedition was there to document how the ice was vanishing in the Antarctic, but the ship became stuck,\u201d Cruz said before the Senate Commerce Subcommittee on Space, Science and Competitiveness. \u201cIt had run into an inconvenient truth, as Al Gore might put it.\u201d\n\nCruz, who chairs the subcommittee, also noted Secretary of State John Kerry\u2019s 2009 claim that the Arctic would be \u201cice-free\u201d by the summer of 2013\u2014which was the same year the researchers became trapped in ice.\n\nRepublicans on the committee said the hearing was intended to shed light on \u201copposing viewpoints in the field of climate science,\u201d which Cruz said are \u201creflexively\u201d brushed aside by policymakers.\n\nHe repeatedly pointed to satellite data that found no significant global warming during the past 18 years, a slowdown often referred to as the warming \u201cpause.\u201d\n\n\u201cGlobal warming alarmists don\u2019t like these data. They are inconvenient to their narrative,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cBut facts and evidence matter.\u201d\n\nJudith Curry, former chair of Georgia Institute of Technology\u2019s School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences, testified that while climate scientists uniformly agree that surface temperatures have increased during the past century, there is \u201cconsiderable\u201d disagreement about whether humans drive global warming and if warming is dangerous to the planet.\n\nCurry\u2019s research led her to findings that natural causes could be playing a larger role in warming than human activity, challenging what many consider \u201csettled\u201d conclusions in the climate debate.\n\nBut instead of leading to reignited deliberation, Curry said the science community quickly branded her a \u201cheretic\u201d for challenging the status quo.\n\n\u201cIn their efforts to promote their \u2018cause,\u2019 the scientific establishment behind the global warming issue has been drawn into the trap of seriously understating the uncertainties associated with the climate problem,\u201d she said, adding: \u201cThis behavior risks destroying science\u2019s reputation for honesty and objectivity. Without this objectivity and honesty, scientists become regarded as merely another lobbyist group.\u201d\n\nDemocrats denounced the four witnesses Republicans called to testify as climate change \u201cdeniers\u201d in a press conference held prior to the hearing.\n\n\u201cThis hearing doesn\u2019t make a lot of sense, given the challenges we are facing,\u201d said Sen. Gary Peters of Michigan, the top Democrat on the subcommittee. \u201cWhen it comes to climate change, the science is pretty clear. It is basically settled.\u201d\n\nAs reason to close debate on the issue, Democrats routinely float the statistic that 97 percent of scientists agree that human activity causes climate change. But those on the right have pushed back on the number, arguing it\u2019s contrived from vague surveys.\n\n\u201cAny time you hear people say scientists should not question the conventional wisdom, you are hearing someone advocating essentially for the abolition of science,\u201d Cruz said.\n\nThe hearing took place days before diplomats in Paris are expected to finalize an international climate pact as the United Nations summit comes to a close Friday.\n\nU.S. diplomats have been working with representatives from nearly 200 other nations for the past week to broker an agreement aimed at cutting global carbon emissions.\n\nKerry told The New York Times Cruz\u2019s hearing would not deter negotiations.\n\n\u201cOne professor is not going to negate peer-reviewed science.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "\"Global warming alarmists don\u2019t like these data.\"", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "\"Global warming alarmists don\u2019t like these data.\"", "title": "Cruz Holds Hearing Challenging Climate Science", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/151208_CruzClimate_Johnson.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-12-09T23:10:06+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1Y0tNne"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "\"Global warming alarmists don\u2019t like these data.\"", "title": "Cruz Holds Hearing Challenging Climate Science", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/151208_CruzClimate_Johnson.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Energy", "tag": "climate change", "published_time": "2015-12-09T11:50:58+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-12-09T23:10:06+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Ted Cruz, global warming, climate change, John Kerry, UN Climate Summit, Paris climate"}, "article_summary": "Republicans on the committee said the hearing was intended to shed light on \u201copposing viewpoints in the field of climate science,\u201d which Cruz said are \u201creflexively\u201d brushed aside by policymakers.\nRepublican Sen.
