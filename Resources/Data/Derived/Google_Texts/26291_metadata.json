One that will give you an unbiased, no-spin comparison of candidate positions on key issues? That's what our Campus Election Engagement Project guide will give you! We are a national nonpartisan initiative working with college and university administrators, faculty, and student leaders to increase student participation in America's elections. For the 2014 elections we have created and distributed voter guides to campuses in more than 20 states so they can provide their communities with accurate information for informed voting. Because these guides have been so well received and are useful for all voting citizens who want to be better informed, we are also posting them here.\n\nWe developed our guides by analyzing information from trusted resources such as www.votesmart.org, www.ontheissues.org, www.ballotpedia.com, www.politifact.com, www.factcheck.org, www.vote411.org and from candidate websites, public debates and interviews, and statements in major media outlets. We also showed them to groups like campus Young Republicans and Young Democrats at the schools we work with to verify their fairness and lack of bias.\n\nSo here are the issue-by-issue stands for Steve Daines and Amanda Curtis , with additional links at the bottom for each candidate if you'd like to dig deeper.\n\n----------\n\nBudget: Did you support raising the Federal debt ceiling with no strings attached?\n\nDaines: No\n\nCurtis: Unknown\n\nCampaign Finance: Do you support the DISCLOSE Act, which would require key funders of political ads to put their names on those ads?\n\nDaines: Unknown\n\nCurtis: Yes\n\nCampaign Finance: Do you support the Supreme Court's Citizens United decision, which allowed unlimited independent political expenditures by corporations and unions?\n\nDaines: Yes\n\nCurtis: No\n\nEconomy: Do you support raising the minimum wage?\n\nDaines: No--opposes national minimum wage, believes should be left to states\n\nCurtis: Yes\n\nEconomy: Do you support extending unemployment benefits beyond 26 weeks?\n\nDaines: No\n\nCurtis: Yes\n\nEconomy: Do you support the Dodd-Frank Act, which established the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and sought to increase regulation of Wall Street corporations and other financial institutions?\n\nDaines: No\n\nCurtis: Unknown\n\nEconomy: Do you support federal spending as a means of promoting economic growth?\n\nDaines: No\n\nCurtis: Yes\n\nEducation: Do you support refinancing of student loans at lower rates, paid for by increasing taxes on income over a million dollars?\n\nDaines: Unknown\n\nCurtis: Supports refinancing of student loans, greater Pell Grant support, and investment in career & technical schools.\n\nEnvironment: Do you believe that human activity is a major factor contributing to climate change?\n\nDaines: No\n\nCurtis: Yes\n\nEnvironment: Do you support government action to limit the levels of greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere?\n\nDaines: No\n\nCurtis: Yes-believes EPA rules can be met without harming Montana coal plants\n\nEnvironment: Do you support government mandates and/or subsidies for renewable energy?\n\nDaines: Some support, but prioritizes fossil fuels, especially coal\n\nCurtis: Probable yes.
