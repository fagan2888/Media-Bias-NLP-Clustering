Lancashire hotpot

Nigel Howarth is one of Britain’s finest cooks, and a fierce advocate of the produce of the Northwest. Alongside his old mates Reg Johnson and Paul Heathcote, they make up a mighty Lancastrian triumvirate. There are various versions of the Lancashire hotpot, but this is the best I’ve ever tasted. It might seem a little cheffy, with all those different cuts of lamb, but it’s not. Serve with pickled red cabbage.

SERVES 4

200g/7oz boneless lamb shoulder, trimmed of excess fat and cut into 4cm/1½ inch pieces

150g/5½ oz lamb leg steaks, cut into

4cm/1½ inch pieces

150g/5½ oz lamb neck fillet, cut into

4cm/1½ inch pieces

pinch of caster sugar

sea salt and freshly ground black pepper

25g/1oz plain flour

4 lamb loin chops (100g/3½ oz each)

2 tbsp olive oil

50g/1¾ oz salted butter, melted

4 onions, thinly sliced

500g/1lb 2oz Golden Wonder or other floury potatoes, peeled and cut into

2mm/1⁄16 in thick slices

pinch of ground white pepper

■ Preheat the oven to fan 160C/350F/gas 4. Season the meat (apart from the loin chops) with the sugar, a good pinch of salt and some black pepper. Toss with the flour and arrange in a heavy hotpot or casserole (about 2 litre/3½ pt capacity).

■ Season the loin chops. Heat the oil in a pan and sear the chops on all sides for 3-4 minutes, or until golden brown. Put them on top of the raw meat.

■ Heat 1 tbsp of the butter in a clean pan over a medium–low heat until foaming, add the onions with a big pinch of salt and cook for 2-3 minutes, or until soft but not browned. Spread the onions evenly over the lamb.

■ Put the potatoes in a bowl, add the remaining butter, season with a good pinch of salt and a pinch of white pepper, and mix well. Layer the sliced potatoes on top of the onions.

■ Bake the hotpot, covered, for 2 hours, removing the lid for the final 30 minutes.
