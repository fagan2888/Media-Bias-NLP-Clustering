Today, with the help of Google Maps, we’ll look at the city of El Ejido in Spain.

See those white rectangles? Those are, technically, green houses, though they’re not much like the greenhouses you’d see at a garden nursery. Google Street View reveals they look like this:

They’re little more than plastic and metal piping. In 2000, an article in The Economist called them “plastic awnings to intensify the sun's rays.”

Which, from the ground, look like this:

And—accumulated by capital and climate change—come together into something which can easily be seen in an image thousands of miles tall by thousands of miles wide.
