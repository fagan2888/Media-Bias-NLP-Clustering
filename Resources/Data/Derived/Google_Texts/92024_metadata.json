And as researchers predicated, family and neighborhood did impact mental health.\n\nMore than 26,000 children developed a psychiatric disorder; 29 percent of these cases were attributed to the child\u2019s family and 5 percent were attributed to their neighborhood deprivation. Neighborhood deprivation refers to the relation between certain neighborhoods and health-related resources, like fresh fruits and vegetables at a supermarket \u2014 and it in particular was associated with a 2-fold risk of externalizing disorders, though not specifically ADHD. Prior research from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation based in Princeton, N.J., found this type of deprivation can increase incident cases of type 2 diabetes and major depression.\n\n\"However, we also found that familial random effects, including both genetic and family environmental factors, accounted for six to eight times as much of the total variation in psychiatric disorders, compared with neighborhood random effects,\" Jan Sundquist, lead researcher, said in a press release. \"The estimated risks and random effects indicate that children are strongly affected by both their family and neighborhood environments and that the former seems to be more important at a population level.\u201d\n\nSundquist added the study\u2019s \u201crich amount of data\u201d results in a comprehensive look at children and adolescent mental heath, answering the many questions people have when it comes to young people. However, more research needs to be done in order to identify means of intervention, as well as the mental health policies needed in order to properly address and manage these risk factors.\n\nAs is, researchers concluded, \u201cthese findings call for policies to promote mental health that consider potential influences from children's family and neighborhood environments.\u201d\n\nSource: Sundquist J, et al.
