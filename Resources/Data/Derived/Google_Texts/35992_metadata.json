Bloomberg News\n\nThe leader of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland said Wednesday the U.S. economy could easily deal with a rate rise right now, but she didn\u2019t call for short-term rates to be boosted at any specific time period.\n\n\u201cThe economy can handle an increase in the fed funds rate,\u201d Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester said. \u201cA small increase in interest rates from zero is not tight monetary policy, and with the economic progress we\u2019ve made and that I expect to continue, monetary policy can take a step back from the emergency measure of zero interest rates,\u201d she explained in the text of speech to be presented before an audience in Columbus, Ohio.\n\nMs. Mester\u2019s appearance coincided with Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen\u2019s trip to Capitol Hill to provide the central bank\u2019s semiannual update on the economy and monetary policy. Ms. Yellen reaffirmed that if the economy plays out as she expects it\u2019s very likely the Fed will raise rates this year. But she declined to say when, explaining it\u2019s more appropriate in any case to think about the path of future rate rises, rather than when the first move up off currently near-zero rates will happen.\n\nStill, some Fed officials have pointed to September as a potential starting point for the Fed\u2019s rate rise campaign. Ms. Mester said in her remarks that it\u2019s reasonable Fed officials might have differing views about when to start raising short-term rates. Ms. Mester isn\u2019t currently a voting member of the monetary policy setting Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nIn her remarks, Ms. Mester was upbeat about the economy\u2019s outlook, both in terms of expected job and inflation performance. But she also cast a cautious eye toward overseas events. She also said that while there are risks to financial stability for keeping rates very low for a long time, she doesn\u2019t see right now evidence of brewing trouble.\n\n\u201cI expect that after a weak first quarter, growth will pick up to an above-trend pace over the rest of this year and next, in the 2.75-3% range,\u201d Ms. Mester said. She said she was aware of the risks presented by events in China and Greece, and said trouble in the latter country\u2019s woes should have a \u201climited impact on the U.S. economy because our direct exposure via trade and banking is limited.\u201d\n\nWhen it comes to the performance of hiring in the U.S., Ms. Mester said \u201cthe totality of evidence suggests that the economy is at or nearly at the Fed\u2019s mandated monetary policy goal of maximum employment.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, weak price pressures are likely to give way, allowing the Fed achieve its desire to get inflation back up to its 2% target, something that hasn\u2019t happened for three years.\n\n\u201cWould I like to see higher inflation numbers? The answer is yes. Am I reasonably confident that inflation will move gradually back to the Fed\u2019s 2% objective over time? The answer is also yes,\u201d Ms. Mester said.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "The leader of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland said Wednesday the U.S. economy could easily deal with a rate rise right now, but she didn\u2019t call for short-term rates to be boosted at any specific time period.", "title": "Fed\u2019s Mester Says Economy Can Easily Deal With Rate Rise Now", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2015/07/15/feds-mester-says-economy-can-easily-deal-with-rate-rise-now/", "image": {"src": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-JK078_mester_P_20150715123711.jpg"}, "site": "WSJecon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Economy", "article.headline": "Fed\u2019s Mester Says Economy Can Easily Deal With Rate Rise Now", "description": "The leader of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland said Wednesday the U.S. economy could easily deal with a rate rise right now, but she didn\u2019t call for short-term rates to be boosted at any specific time period.", "article_section": "Economy", "author": "Michael S.
