It is our hope that this lawsuit will result in changes to how the Greenwich school system responds to students in need of help so that there will be no more needless deaths.\u201d\n\nBart\u2019s parents describe him as a socially awkward teenager who was called names by his schoolmates and had his brand new Android phone destroyed by his bullies.\n\n\"We as a community failed this child\": Family of bullied teen sues town after his death http://t.co/RDonqMp43b pic.twitter.com/HekEQzYKsL \u2014 NBC Los Angeles (@NBCLA) August 14, 2015\n\nThe bullying began in middle school and continued up through high school until his death. At first, his older sister Beata was able to give him some protection from his bullies, but that ended when she graduated. The first day of the next school year, Bart took his own life.\n\nThe parents\u2019 lawyer, David Golub, says school documents show officials knew about Bart\u2019s bullying but failed to act.\n\n\u201cThe middle school sharings document is a smoking gun. It shows that the school system knew, but ignored the Board of Education\u2019s anti-bullying procedures.\u201d\n\nBullying has become a hot-button issue in America.\n\nEncourage your kids to talk about bullying if they experience it. #BackToSchool tips: http://t.co/VnwomQGfle pic.twitter.com/DwePlemDbI \u2014 Kids.gov (@Kidsgov) August 12, 2015\n\nLast week, a federal judge dismissed a similar suit by a family who claimed the Nevada school district was responsible for their daughter\u2019s suicide because they didn\u2019t do enough to protect her.\n\nIn April, the family of 15-year-old Audrie Pott settled with the families of two teenage boys after they raped and then cyberbullied her.\n\nEarlier this month, an Illinois father was arrested for allegedly trying to run down a group of elementary kids who were harassing his daughter. Roy Williams Jr., 56, was confronting the group over a fight they got into with his daughter at a school bus stop.\n\nShould schools be required to do more to protect kids from bullies?\n\n[Photo: Facebook]", "article_metadata": {"description": "The parents of a 15-year-old boy who committed suicide in 2013 after being bullied for years are suing the town of Greenwich, Conn. and the Board of Education.", "og": {"site_name": "The Inquisitr News", "description": "The parents of a 15-year-old boy who committed suicide in 2013 after being bullied for years are suing the town of Greenwich, Conn. and the Board of Education.", "title": "Parents Of Bullied Teen Sue Entire Town For His Suicide", "url": "http://www.inquisitr.com/2338288/parents-of-bullied-teen-sue-entire-town-for-his-suicide/", "image": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/BartPalosz.jpeg", "article": {"published_time": "2015-08-15T14:23:28+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-08-15T14:35:03+00:00"}, "type": "article"}, "image": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/BartPalosz.jpeg", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ed1c24", "datePublished": "2015-08-15T14:23:28+00:00", "fb": {"pages": 71179904752, "app_id": 164157850314499}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/assets/0cec37/dist/images/logos/inq-win.png", "keywords": "administrators,board of education,bullied,bully,bullying,greenwich,high school,kids,school,suicide,news", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "y_key": "f282393706a5fd85", "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/BartPalosz.jpeg", "height": 409, "width": 670}, "site": "@theinquisitr", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "The parents of a 15-year-old boy who committed suicide in 2013 after being bullied for years are suing the town of Greenwich, Conn. and the Board of Education."}, "viewport": "width=980"}, "article_summary": "It shows that the school system knew, but ignored the Board of Education\u2019s anti-bullying procedures.\u201dBullying has become a hot-button issue in America.\nShould schools be required to do more to protect kids from bullies?\nThe parents of a 15-year-old boy who committed suicide in 2013 after being bullied for years are suing the town of Greenwich, Connecticut, and the Board of Education for not protecting him.\nThe parents\u2019 lawyer, David Golub, says school documents show officials knew about Bart\u2019s bullying but failed to act.\nSchool administrators told the parents a social worker needed to be involved, but then didn\u2019t take any steps to help Bart or punish his bullies."}
