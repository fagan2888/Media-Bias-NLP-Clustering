The Executive Director of the New York State of Health Marketplace says the state has managed to get more of the Latino community enrolled.

A recent report by the state health insurance exchange shows a four percent increase in the number of Latinos who’ve signed up for coverage since 2014.

Since the end of the 2015 open enrollment, 25 percent of those insured self-identified as Latino.

Donna Frescatore, executive director of the state exchange, says it’s related to a concerted effort in the states Latino communities.

"We introduced a new Spanish online application that we’re getting great feedback on. And it’s getting a good deal of use; we want to continue to expand that. And also, we’re present at many cultural events throughout the state in Latino communities," says Frescatore.

The actual demographic breakdown of those insured through the health insurance marketplace is still unclear. Nearly a third of enrollees chose not to respond to the optional confidential questions about race and ethnicity.

Frescatore says people have a choice, "but we would certainly encourage people to self-report, because it helps us in our planning process and it helps us better understand the New Yorkers that we’re reaching and those that we have a little bit more work to do."

2.1 million New Yorkers have enrolled in health insurance on the New York State of Health Marketplace over the first two years of the Affordable Care Act.
