Of those 40% will be eligible for the states free Medi-Cal health services, while the remaining will be ineligible under the program\u2019s income requirements.\n\nMedi-Cal is the state\u2019s name for Medicaid, a federal health services program for people who have low income. According to KQED News, the newly protected illegal immigrants do not qualify for other benefits of the Affordable Care Act and are not eligible for subsidies on the Covered California exchange.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ll be in the same situation as DACA,\u201d said Gabrielle Lessard, a health policy attorney with the Los Angeles office of the National Immigration Law Center. Lessard was referring to a 2012 executive action by the president known as the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals. DACA granted deferred deportation to children born in America from parents who were in the country illegally.\n\nCalifornia extends Medicaid benefits to DACA immigrants while most states do not. Ronald Coleman, government affairs manager for the California Immigrant Policy Center, explained to KQED in the California Report that deferred deportation means that the immigrants are now legal in the eyes of the law. He asserted that \u201cCalifornia has historically covered broad populations of immigrants who reside in the state.\u201d\n\nColeman added all those that qualify for deferred deportation are \u201cwork eligible and, as lawfully present immigrants, they will be eligible for the state Medi-Cal program \u2026 if they are income eligible.\u201d\n\nA Department of Health Care Services spokesman, Tony Cava, told KQED that so far they have not received any specifics on Obama\u2019s latest executive action so they are \u201cunable to assess any impact it might have on Medi-Cal services.\u201d\n\nCava pointed out that any illegal immigrant requiring emergency health services must be taken care of and that none of their personal information can be used \u201cfor any type of civil immigration enforcement action under U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement law.\u201d\n\nNevertheless, illegal immigrants remain reluctant to enroll in health insurance programs for fear of being deported or revealing the identity of other illegal relatives.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Executive Amnesty: 400,000 Illegal Immigrants Eligible for Free Health Services in California", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Executive Amnesty: 400,000 Illegal Immigrants Eligible for Free Health Services in California", "title": "Executive Amnesty: 400,000 Illegal Immigrants Eligible for Free Health Services in California - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Breitbart-California/2014/11/20/illegal%20immigrant.jpg", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/california/2014/11/21/executive-amnesty-illegal-immigrants-eligible-for-free-health-services-california/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Executive Amnesty: 400,000 Illegal Immigrants Eligible for Free Health Services in California", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Breitbart-California/2014/11/20/illegal%20immigrant.jpg", "title": "Executive Amnesty: 400,000 Illegal Immigrants Eligible for Free Health Services in California - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": ",Breitbart California,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Breitbart California", "published_time": "2014-11-21T09:53:00-07:00", "categories": "Breitbart California"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "Of those 40% will be eligible for the states free Medi-Cal health services, while the remaining will be ineligible under the program\u2019s income requirements.\nLessard was referring to a 2012 executive action by the president known as the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals.\nMedi-Cal is the state\u2019s name for Medicaid, a federal health services program for people who have low income.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERRoughly one million undocumented immigrants in California qualify for President Obama\u2019s executive action of deferred deportation that he announced on Thursday.\nDACA granted deferred deportation to children born in America from parents who were in the country illegally."}
