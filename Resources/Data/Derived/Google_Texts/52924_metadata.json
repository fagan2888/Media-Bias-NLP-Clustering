Although the video description alludes the family asking Hart to move his cruiser from where it was blocking their driveway, it seems instead that mother Cassandra Meyers was initially pulled over for a licence plate violation. When her father-in-law, Aaron Tatowski, arrived on the scene in his truck with his girlfriend and Meyers\u2019 three children, he approached the officer and pressed him about the way he was questioning Meyers.\n\nAccording to Toledo News Now, things escalated quickly from there. \u201cHe hollered for me to get back in my truck, so I got back in my truck,\u201d Tatkowski told the station. \u201cNext thing you know, I\u2019m yanked out of the truck and it made my girlfriend say a few things. He yanked her out of the truck.\u201d\n\nAccording to TNN, Tatkowski claims the officer threw him and his family to the ground.\n\nThe video clearly depicts Tatowski, Meyers, and the eldest son flat on the ground as Officer Hart brandishes his handgun.

Another bystander advises Tatowski to be quiet and stop antagonizing the officer: \u201cShut up, Aaron,\u201d he says, though it\u2019s Meyers who screams loudest, bringing the whole neighborhood out. Eventually, Tatowski is the one arrested, and Hart tosses aside the phone of someone else recording the altercation.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A routine traffic stop ends with a terrifying and disgusting display of overpolicing VIDEO", "title": "Traffic cop terrorizes family at gunpoint", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "A routine traffic stop ends with a terrifying and disgusting display of overpolicing VIDEO", "title": "Traffic cop terrorizes family at gunpoint", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2013/09/21/traffic_cop_terrorizes_family_at_gunpoint_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/09/fe53025eec02091c71e8410a42dd061e.jpeg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A routine traffic stop ends with a terrifying and disgusting display of overpolicing VIDEO", "title": "Traffic cop terrorizes family at gunpoint", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/09/fe53025eec02091c71e8410a42dd061e.jpeg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Miles Klee", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, 9/11, cop, daily dot, Family, Police, Policing, the daily dot, traffic stop, Video", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Why the traffic cop, identified later by authorities only as \u201cOfficer Hart,\u201d took such extreme action remains a murky issue, but the dispute apparently arose out of one of two scenario.\nThe video clearly depicts Tatowski, Meyers, and the eldest son flat on the ground as Officer Hart brandishes his handgun.\nHe yanked her out of the truck.\u201dAccording to TNN, Tatkowski claims the officer threw him and his family to the ground.\nTopics: 9/11, cop, daily dot, Family, Police, Policing, the daily dot, traffic stop, Video, Media News, Life News, NewsThis article originally appeared on The Daily DotIn Toledo, Ohio, a police officer made an entire family lie in the street with a gun pointed at their heads\u2014and it\u2019s all on YouTube.\nWitnesses can be heard dialing 911\u2014\u201cget another cop,\u201d one says\u2014and expressing concern about the two babies still sitting alone in the truck."}
