Ted Cruz (R-Texas) believes the Obama administration\u2019s attempts are nothing but condescending and patronizing to young people.\n\nSpeaking with radio host Ben Shapiro, Cruz criticized the White House for its repeated tries to encourage young people to sign up for health insurance under Obamacare.\n\n\u201cYou know, I think young people can do without the condescension and patronizing from Washington,\u201d Cruz told Shapiro, referencing an ad featuring First Lady Michelle Obama in which she said, \u201cWe nag you because we love you.\u201d\n\nWith the open-enrollment period coming to a close on March 31, the White House has tapped A-list celebrities \u2014 and their mothers \u2014 athletes and pop culture icons to help reach Millennials.\n\nPresident Barack Obama appeared on the web show \u201cBetween Two Ferns,\u201d and Michelle Obama was featured in a video starring celebrities\u2019 mothers in an effort to convince young people to sign up for Obamacare. Additionally, the White House took advantage of March Madness and created \u201cThe Sweetest 16 Reasons to Get Covered,\u201d a play on the Sweet 16.\n\nThe Obama administration, though, remains mum on exactly how many 18- to 34-year-olds have actually signed up for Obamacare in the weeks leading up to March 31.\n\nAccording to the latest figures from the Department of Health and Human Services, more than 5 million people have signed up for health insurance under Obamacare. Only 25 percent, though, are Millennials. The White House previously set a target goal of 38 percent.\n\nWhile Obama continues to preach about the benefits of the Affordable Care Act \u2014 he\u2019s making an appearance on \u201cEllen\u201d tomorrow \u2014 Cruz said the president is ignoring the more than 6 million Americans who lost their insurance because of the law.\n\n\u201cThe president is doing a lot of pop culture. He\u2019s sitting between a couple of ferns, he\u2019s hanging out with basketball stars,\u201d the Tea Party darling said. \u201cHe\u2019s trying to say everything is hip and hunky-dory without taking responsibility to the over 6 million people who\u2019ve had their health insurance policies canceled because of Obamacare.\u201d\n\nListen to Cruz and Shapiro\u2019s interview below.\n\nh/t Washington Examiner", "article_metadata": {"generator": "NGFB Pro 7.8.4U", "og": {"site_name": "Red Alert Politics", "description": "While the White House continues to pander to Millennials in an effort to convince them to sign up for Obamacare, Sen.
