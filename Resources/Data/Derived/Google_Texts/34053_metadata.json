March 31 is the end of the annual open enrollment period when people who don\u2019t have coverage through their employers can sign up on or off their state\u2019s marketplace. With limited exceptions, people who miss this enrollment window will be unable to sign up for health insurance until next fall for coverage that starts in January 2015. In addition to being uninsured, you will face a penalty for not having coverage. The fine may be bigger than you expect. Here are the details:\n\nIs everyone required to have health insurance this year or pay a fine?\n\nThis year, most people who can afford to buy health insurance but don\u2019t do so will face a penalty, sometimes called a \u201cshared responsibility payment.\u201d The requirement to have health insurance applies to adults and children alike, but there are exceptions for certain groups of people and those who are experiencing financial hardship.\n\nWhat kind of insurance satisfies the requirement to have coverage?\n\nMost plans that provide comprehensive coverage count as \u201cminimum essential coverage.\u201d That includes job-based insurance and plans purchased on the individual market, either on or off the exchange. Most Medicaid plans and Medicare Part A, which covers hospital benefits, count as well, as do most types of Tricare military coverage and some Veterans Administration coverage.\n\nInsurance that provides limited benefits generally doesn\u2019t qualify, including standalone vision and dental plans or plans that only pay in the event someone has an accident or gets cancer or another specified illness.\n\nIf I don\u2019t have health insurance, how much will I owe?\n\nIn 2014, the penalty is the greater of a flat $95 per adult and $47.50 per child under age 18, up to a maximum of $285 per family, or 1 percent of your family\u2019s modified adjusted gross income that is over the threshold the requires you to file a tax return. That threshold is $10,150 for an individual, $13,050 for a head of household and $20,300 for a married couple filing jointly.\n\nNext year the penalty increases to $325 per adult or 2 percent of income, and in 2016 it will be the greater of $695 or 2.5 percent of income.\n\nThe $95 penalty has gotten a lot of press, but many people will be paying substantially more than that. A single person earning more than $19,650 would not qualify for the $95 penalty ($19,650 \u2013 $10,150 = $9,500 x 1% = $95). So the 1 percent penalty is the standard that will apply in most cases, say experts. For example, for a single person whose MAGI is $35,000, the penalty would be $249 ($35,000 \u2013 $10,150 = $24,850 x 1% = $249).\n\nThe penalty is capped at the national average price for a bronze plan, or about $9,800, says Brian Haile, senior vice president for health policy at Jackson Hewitt Tax Service. The vast majority of taxpayers\u2019 incomes aren\u2019t high enough to be affected by the penalty cap, he says.\n\nMany more people will be able to avoid the penalty altogether because their income is below the filing threshold.\n\nAre there any special circumstances that allow me to get insurance outside the annual open enrollment period?\n\nYes. If you have a change in your life circumstances such as getting married, adopting a child or losing your job and your health insurance, it may trigger a special enrollment period when you can sign up for or change coverage and avoid paying a fine. In addition, if your income is low and meets guidelines in the law, you can generally sign up for your state\u2019s Medicaid or CHIP program at any time.\n\nI\u2019m uninsured and signed up on the exchange in March for a plan that starts May 1. Will I owe a penalty for the first four months of the year?\n\nNo. In October, the Department of Health and Human Services released guidance saying that anyone who signs up for coverage by the end of the open enrollment period on March 31 will not owe a fine for the months prior to the start of coverage.\n\nWhat if I have a gap in coverage this year after open enrollment ends? Will I have to pay a fine?\n\nIt depends. If the gap in coverage is less than three consecutive months, you can avoid owing a penalty. Subsequent coverage gaps during the year, however, could trigger a fine.\n\nIf you have coverage for even one day during a month, it counts as coverage for that month. The penalty, if there is one, would be calculated in monthly increments.\n\nAre parents responsible for paying the penalty if their kids don\u2019t have coverage?\n\nThey may be. If you claim a child as a dependent on your tax return, you\u2019ll be on the hook for the penalty if the child doesn\u2019t have insurance. In cases where parents are divorced, the parent who claims the child as a tax dependent would be responsible for the penalty.\n\nWho\u2019s exempt from the requirement to have insurance?\n\nThe list of possible exemptions is a long one. You may be eligible for an exemption if:\n\nYour income is below the federal income tax filing threshold (see above).\n\nThe lowest priced available plan costs more than 8 percent of your income.\n\nYour income is less than 138 percent of the federal poverty level (currently $15,856 for an individual) and your state did not expand Medicaid coverage to adults at this income level as permitted under the health law.\n\nYou experienced one of several hardships, including eviction, bankruptcy or domestic violence.\n\nYour individual insurance plan was cancelled and you consider plans on the marketplace are unaffordable.\n\nYou are a member of an Indian tribe, health care sharing ministry or a religious group that objects to insurance.\n\nYou are in jail.\n\nYou are an immigrant who is not in the country legally.\n\nFor a more complete list go to the exemptions page at healthcare.gov or the questions and answers page on shared responsibilities provisions on the IRS website.\n\nWhen should I claim or file for an exemption?\n\nThere\u2019s no one-size-fits-all answer. You can claim some of the exemptions when you file your tax return in 2015, but for others, you will have to complete an exemption application available at healthcare.gov.\n\nIf you believe you may be eligible for an exemption for financial reasons, experts recommend filling out the paperwork now, if possible, based on your current income and other information. That way, if your circumstances change later in the year \u2014 if your income goes up, for example, and you no longer qualify for an exemption based on plan affordability \u2014 having a certificate of exemption should enable you to avoid owing the penalty. In addition, losing a hardship exemption triggers a special enrollment period to buy a plan outside the annual open enrollment period, but only if you have a hardship exemption in hand.\n\n\u201cFrom a consumer perspective, even though it\u2019s kind of a burden to go through the process, it makes sense to get the hardship exemption certificate, to be safe,\u201d says Judith Solomon, vice president for health policy at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.\n\nAre U.S. citizens living overseas subject to the penalty for not having insurance?\n\nIf you live abroad for at least 330 days during a 12-month period, you aren\u2019t required to have coverage in the States.\n\nWhat happens if I don\u2019t pay the penalty?\n\nThe IRS may offset your income tax refund to collect the penalty, but that\u2019s about it. Unlike other situations where the tax agency can garnish wages or file liens to collect unpaid taxes, the health law prohibits these activities in cases where people don\u2019t pay the penalty for not having insurance.", "article_metadata": {"description": "If you're uninsured, now's the time to buy a plan.
