If I was going to give advice, where I would give it, other than I would blanketly throw out every senior manager in the VA.\"I know that sounds harsh, but I don't know how else you would do this surgically. There is an entire bureaucracy here that has been allowing this to happen for years and years and years, and I dont know how you get one administrator at the top who\u2019s going to somehow change the culture without throwing out all these people.\"During the interview, Griffin summarized the conclusion of a shocking report issued by the Office of the Special Counsel \u2013 which protects whistleblowers \u2013 as, \"We do not believe the VA. We do not believe the VA is investigating. We do not believe that they can get to the bottom of these issues.\"He said the Special Counsel found \"10 different cases across the country, specific examples where they believe a whistleblower came forward, veterans were harmed, nothing happened.\"In a separate interview on CNN , Griffin elaborated on the lack of care outlined in a letter and report by the Office of Special Counsel For example, he said that at a Brockton, Mass., VA facility, another vet had only one psychiatric note in his entire medical chart over seven years as an inpatient. Yet the VA's medical review agency \"denied that . . . (it) had any impact on patient care,\" CNN reported.\n\nCNN said the agency is investigating more than 50 whistleblower disclosures involving patient health or safety allegations at the VA nationwide, and, according to the report, \"these cases represent more than a quarter of all matters referred by OSC for investigation government-wide.\"\n\nSloan Gibson, the VA's acting director, told CNN in a statement: \"I respect and welcome the letter and the insights from the Office of Special Counsel. I am deeply disappointed not only in the substantiation of allegations raised by whistleblowers, but also in the failures within VA to take whistleblower complaints seriously.\"He told CNN he'd directed a \"comprehensive review of all aspects of the Office of Medical Inspector's operation, to be completed within 14 days.\"", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Drew Griffin", "pubdate": "2014-06-23T19:12:13", "og": {"site_name": "Newsmax", "description": "The CNN reporter who first reported on the deadly delays in care at Veterans Administration hospitals says the beleaguered agency \"can't fix itself\" and should \"fire every senior manager.\"", "title": "CNN's Drew Griffin: VA Should 'Fire Every Senior Manager'", "url": "http://www.newsmax.com/Newsfront/Drew-Griffin/2014/06/23/id/578812/", "page_id": 85452072376, "image": "http://www.newsmax.com/App_Themes/Newsmax/images/facebook/newsmaxFBLogo.gif", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.newsmax.com/Newsfront/Drew-Griffin/2014/06/23/id/578812/", "description": "The CNN reporter who first reported on the deadly delays in care at Veterans Administration hospitals says the beleaguered agency \"can't fix itself\" and should \"fire every senior manager.\"", "site": "Newsmax", "title": "CNN's Drew Griffin: VA Should 'Fire Every Senior Manager'"}, "epoch": 1403550733, "keywords": "Drew Griffin", "fb": {"admins": 100002083767056, "app_id": 323020797885219}, "article": {"section": "Newsfront", "published_time": "2014-06-23T19:12:13"}, "msvalidate.01": "FAF1322EC761685A5DD9344A1C19E82A", "google-site-verification": "Jt2HUKgzJJw9VwIQJv31ETytuvNNm5ypTWN6j0nYvHM", "original-source": "http://www.newsmax.com/Newsfront/Drew-Griffin/2014/06/23/id/578812/", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "description": "The CNN reporter who first reported on the deadly delays in care at Veterans Administration hospitals says the beleaguered agency  can't fix itself  and should  fire every senior manager."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9d57\"", "article_summary": "If I was going to give advice, where I would give it, other than I would blanketly throw out every senior manager in the VA.\"I know that sounds harsh, but I don't know how else you would do this surgically.\n\"Based on everything I know to date, I don't think the VA can fix itself,\" Griffin said in the interview, posted on Mediaite \"I don't know how you fix this, I really don\u2019t know.\nThe CNN reporter who first reported on the deadly delays in care at Veterans Administration hospitals says the beleaguered agency \"can't fix itself\" and should \"fire every senior manager.\n\"During the interview, Griffin summarized the conclusion of a shocking report issued by the Office of the Special Counsel \u2013 which protects whistleblowers \u2013 as, \"We do not believe the VA.
