Four seats are up for grabs:\n\n\u2022 At-large: Barbara O\u2019Brien, Michael Kiley and Joan Poston;\n\n\u2022 District 2, southwest: Rosario C de Baca and Rosemary Rodriguez;\n\n\u2022 District 3, central: Mike Johnson and Meg Schomp; and\n\n\u2022 District 4, northeast: Landri Taylor and Roger Kilgore.\n\nIf history is any prediction, fewer than 120,000 of Denver\u2019s 441,000 registered voters will cast ballots. However, national special interests and a handful of local heavy hitters will write five- and six-figure checks, hoping to steer the outcome of the low-turnout elections.\n\nIn my view, the campaigns are a waste of resources. Neither Denver\u2019s students nor long-term solutions to the district\u2019s challenges are served.\n\nI know most of the candidates and respect all of them for their willingness to take on the thankless and quixotic civic work of a volunteer school board member. Thankless, because board members are not paid, do not have the expertise, and are not properly supported to grapple with the complexities of a billion-dollar public institution. Quixotic, because the battle between so-called reformers and so-called traditionalists is irrelevant to the real issues facing Denver students and their families: Nearly 70 percent of DPS students qualify for free or reduced lunch.\n\nIn Denver, measurable student outcomes for every grade and subject remain below state averages. Higher-income students perform better than lower-income students, regardless of school type, grade level and curriculum. Though a bigger percentage of DPS graduates are attending college, an even larger percentage require remediation.\n\nThe marked increase in DPS enrollment does not reflect substantial improvement for a majority of students. Growth has more to do with Denver\u2019s publicly funded and rapidly expanding preschool program.\n\nDistrict stats can be manipulated to support nearly every point of view. However, several facts are irrefutable: Low-income kids continue to trail behind.\n\nDenver\u2019s families would be better served if the fractious Board of Education could find areas of agreement.\n\nPerhaps air conditioning for every school and a 12-month calendar is the right starting place.\n\nSome 86,000 DPS students are housed in 156 buildings citywide. Of those, 72 schools (and other administrative structures) are air conditioned. The 2012 DPS bond of $466 million included $25.5 million for \u201cheat mitigation\u201d for 84 schools. But central air conditioning, enjoyed by DPS administrators, will not be added to every school building. Cost estimates are upwards of $300 million.\n\nThe traditional nine-month school year has been around since our economy was primarily agrarian and children were needed to work the fields. Year-round, multi-track schooling is educationally and financially smart. Buildings are used year-round because students are never out of school for extended periods.\n\nTeachers can offer more instruction because students forget less during shorter breaks. Working parent households aren\u2019t challenged to find summer child care. The per-pupil cost decreases with year-round schooling despite increased operating costs.\n\nWhen you get the bricks and sticks right, the heart, mind and soul will follow.\n\nCivic activist Susan Barnes-Gelt can be reached at BarnesGelt@gmail. com or @SBGTweets.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Barnes-Gelt: An idea for DPS: Year-round classes", "title": "Barnes-Gelt: An idea for DPS: Year-round classes", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2013/09/19/barnes-gelt-an-idea-for-dps-year-round-classes/", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20130920__Denver-Public-School-year-roundp1.jpg", "height": 400}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20130920__Denver-Public-School-year-roundp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2013-09-19T17:59:27+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-28T15:06:07+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb104\"", "article_summary": "Neither Denver\u2019s students nor long-term solutions to the district\u2019s challenges are served.\nQuixotic, because the battle between so-called reformers and so-called traditionalists is irrelevant to the real issues facing Denver students and their families: Nearly 70 percent of DPS students qualify for free or reduced lunch.\nSome 86,000 DPS students are housed in 156 buildings citywide.\nI know most of the candidates and respect all of them for their willingness to take on the thankless and quixotic civic work of a volunteer school board member.\nBuildings are used year-round because students are never out of school for extended periods."}
