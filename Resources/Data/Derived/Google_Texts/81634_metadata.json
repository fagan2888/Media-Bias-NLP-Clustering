Michael Lindsay, a 42-year-old former Rice University sociologist known for his study of leadership and evangelicalism, penned a \u201cpersonal message\u201d this week saying that he was not trying to drag the school into \u201cpolitically charged issues.\u201d\n\nSpeaking to a Democratic fundraiser in June, Obama said he would sign an executive order disallowing federal contractors from discriminating in hiring on the basis of \u201creal or perceived sexual orientation.\u201d That would affect religious nonprofits and charities that do federally funded work.\n\nThe letter from a politically moderate group of religious leaders was sent a day after the Supreme Court\u2019s Hobby Lobby ruling, declaring that \u201cclosely held\u201d businesses are exempt from paying for contraceptives for employees under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nBut the letter was in the works before that, according to signatory Michael Wear, The Boston Globe reported. Wear served in the White House faith-based initiative during Obama\u2019s first term and directed faith outreach for Obama\u2019s 2012 reelection campaign.\n\nLindsay\u2019s personal message said the religious leaders asked Obama for the \u201csame religious exemption that was passed\u201d by the Democratic-controlled Senate in 2013, the Employment Non-Discrimination Act, \u201cwith bipartisan support.\u201d That bill was sponsored by Oregon Democratic Sen. Jeff Merkley, a Lutheran.\n\n\u201cSigning the letter was in keeping with our decades-old conviction that, as an explicitly Christian institution, Gordon should set the conduct expectations for members of our community,\u201d Lindsay wrote. \u201cNothing has changed in our position,\u201d he said, while adding that \u201cGordon has also been a place where constructive and respectful dialogue takes place.\u201d\n\nA spokesman for Lindsay told the Globe that Lindsay did not sign a previous letter with a similar message that was signed by 150 leaders, including those at the Council for Christian Colleges and Universities, of which Gordon is a member. That letter was sent to the White House June 25.\n\n\u201cDr. Lindsay agreed to add his name to [the July 1 letter] to affirm the College\u2019s support on the underlying concern for religious liberty, not to take a political position for the college,\u201d spokesman Rick Sweeney said.\n\nThe July 1 letter to Obama was signed by many leaders close to Obama, including former Pennsylvania Democratic Rep. Kathy Dahlkemper, who is a pro-life Catholic, and now Erie County executive; megachurch pastor Rick Warren, who performed the invocation at Obama\u2019s first inauguration; and Frank Snyder, CEO of Catholic Charities USA.\n\n\u201cWe believe that all persons are created in the divine image of the creator\u2026 even so, it still may not be possible for all sides to reach a consensus on the same issue,\u201d the religious leaders wrote.\n\n\u201cThat is why we are asking that an extension of protection for one group not come at the expense of faith communities whose religious identity and beliefs motivate them to serve those in need,\u201d the letter said.\n\nThe letter does not include an explicit denouncement of LGBT practice, rights or lifestyle, but instead focuses on the defense of religious freedoms.\n\n\u201cThe hiring policies of these organizations \u2014 Christian, Jewish, Muslim, and others \u2014 extend from their religious beliefs and values: the same values that motivate them to serve their neighbors in the first place,\u201d the religious leaders said.\n\nThe letter asks Obama to include a similar provision for religious institutions as in the Employment Non-Discrimination Act if he signs an executive order.\n\nUnder the signatories list, the letter reads \u201cOrganizational affiliations are listed for identification purposes only,\u201d meaning the signatories are speaking for themselves only.\n\nCollege Fix contributor TJ Jan is a student at Seattle Pacific University.\n\nLike The College Fix on Facebook / Follow us on Twitter\n\nIMAGES: Gordon College", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The College Fix", "description": "Religious nonprofits and charities that do government work could get blocked from federal funds under Obama order.", "title": "Christian College President Won't Back Down On Hiring Exemption Letter To Obama - The College Fix", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://www.thecollegefix.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/DMichaelLindsay.GordonCollege.WMC_.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-07-11T00:38:20-04:00", "url": "http://www.thecollegefix.com/post/18384/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.thecollegefix.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Gordon.GordonCollege.screenshot.jpg", "description": "Religious nonprofits and charities that do government work could get blocked from federal funds under Obama order.", "card": "summary", "title": "Christian College President Won't Back Down On Hiring Exemption Letter To Obama - The College Fix"}, "fb": {"admins": "672627547,1540010264,100009162449428", "app_id": 1559699120988871}, "article": {"section": "Featured", "tag": "rick warren", "published_time": "2014-07-11T01:00:09-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-07-11T00:38:20-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb089\"", "article_summary": "Like The College Fix on Facebook / Follow us on TwitterIMAGES: Gordon College\nA young Christian college president who signed onto a letter from religious leaders, asking President Barack Obama to exempt their institutions from proposed antidiscrimination rules, is speaking out about the \u201cconfusion\u201d his signature has caused at his school.\nThe letter asks Obama to include a similar provision for religious institutions as in the Employment Non-Discrimination Act if he signs an executive order.\nBut the letter was in the works before that, according to signatory Michael Wear, The Boston Globe reported.\n\u201cThe hiring policies of these organizations \u2014 Christian, Jewish, Muslim, and others \u2014 extend from their religious beliefs and values: the same values that motivate them to serve their neighbors in the first place,\u201d the religious leaders said."}
