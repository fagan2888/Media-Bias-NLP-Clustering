If the frustration feels familiar, it should\u2014it tracks with the contempt the left felt for the high court after the Bush v. Gore decision in 2000 resolving the disputed presidential election, and after the 2010 Citizens United decision that struck down some of the campaign speech restrictions of the 2002 McCain-Feingold law known as the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act.\n\nGetting rid of the Supreme Court would require either disregarding the Constitution entirely (not exactly the best campaign position for a candidate for a job whose oath of office includes a pledge to \u201cpreserve, protect and defend\u201d the same document) or amending it somehow to deal with Article III, which vests the judicial power of the United States \u201cin one Supreme Court.\u201d\n\nEven if all that political heavy lifting weren\u2019t involved, however, there\u2019s a strong case to be made that we\u2019re freer with the Court than without it. Consider three cases from this term where the court stepped in to, essentially, protect the property rights of capitalists.\n\nMy favorite of the three\u2014though it is a close call\u2014was today\u2019s five to four opinion in Michigan v. EPA. There the court struck down a plan by President Obama\u2019s Environmental Protection Agency to impose air-quality regulations that would have cost coal-fired electric power plants $9.6 billion a year to achieve benefits worth between $4 million and $6 million a year. The petitioners included not only 23 states, but also the National Mining Association and the Utility Air Regulatory Group. It was a member of the Utility Air Regulatory Group, Peabody Energy, that retained Harvard Law Professor Laurence Tribe to argue against President Obama\u2019s EPA, thus triggering some of the most entertaining pre-decision drama.\n\nThe dean emeritus of NYU law school, Richard Revesz, who is a fine fellow, took to the op-ed page of The New York Times to predict that Tribe\u2019s claims \u201cseem unlikely to persuade a court.\u201d Two other Harvard Law professors, Jody Freeman and Richard Lazarus, publicly attacked their colleague, Professor Tribe, for making arguments for the coal industry that they described as \u201cbaseless\u2026ridiculous\u2026wholly without merit.\u201d\n\nThe coal industry isn\u2019t exactly popular in polite circles these days. Michael Bloomberg\u2019s Bloomberg Philanthropies teamed up with the Sierra Club for a campaign that boasts about how many coal-fired electric power plants it has forced closed. But our Supreme Court stuck to the law and protected the coal-burning companies who had nowhere else to turn.\n\nThe second case was decided by an eight to one margin. Here, too, the court ruled that the Obama administration had exceeded its authority under the law. The case, Horne v. Department of Agriculture, involved Fresno, Calif., raisin farmers Marvin and Laura Horne, who were forced to turn over some of their raisin crop to the federal government as part of a program to raise raisin prices by reducing the supply. The government\u2019s position had been that if the Hornes didn\u2019t want to give their raisins up to the federales, they were free to grow a different crop. Perhaps endive (Michael Dukakis\u2019s favorite) would do, or kale.\n\nThe third case was lower profile\u2014I wouldn\u2019t even have noticed it if not for a press release from the Institute for Justice, a non-profit libertarian law firm. It involves a business owner in Norfolk, Va., who posted a protest banner on the side of his building to resist its seizure by eminent domain. The IJ quotes Bob Wilson, one of the owners of Central Radio, exclaiming, \u201cI am ecstatic! My local government violated my constitutional rights, but today, the U.S. Supreme Court restored those rights, and it restored my faith in our nation\u2019s justice system.\u201d In this case, Central Radio Company v. City of Norfolk, the Supreme Court did not issue a formal opinion, just vacated a lower court\u2019s judgment and ordered a review.\n\nThe stereotypical Supreme Court petitioner is a discriminated-against minority\u2014Oliver Brown trying to get his daughter Linda into a Topeka public school, or gay couples seeking to wed. It\u2019s a sad commentary on our times that business owners and property owners need court protection from government assaults on their rights. They are, in some ways, the embattled minorities of our time. Imperfect as the court is, at its best it is capable of restoring faith.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "Pay no attention to those who want to abolish SCOTUS", "title": "Get Rid of the Supreme Court?
