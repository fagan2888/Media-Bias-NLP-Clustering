They were nephews of Dwayne and Dawna Johnson.\n\n\u201cLittle did we know, life would change at that moment,\u201d Johnson family friend Mike Carr said during the memorial service held in the Buena Vista High School auditorium.\n\nThe Chaffee County Times reports ( http://bit.ly/1fRcrJ1) Dwayne\u2019s presence as a community father figure, Dawna\u2019s feisty personality and Kiowa-Rain\u2019s smile were frequently mentioned by the friends and family members who addressed the somber crowd.\n\n\u201cWe all knew and were touched by the lives of Dwayne, Dawna and Kiowa,\u201d Carr said.\n\nDwayne and Dawna Johnson were football and track coaches, respectively, in Buena Vista schools, and were well known in the town and very active in community events.\n\n\u201cThe way he coached was the way he lived his life,\u201d retired Buena Vista football coach Bob Marken said, recalling his friend as an always-helpful and generous man whose faith was present even on the football field.\n\nMarken said Dwayne\u2019s prayers would start with Jesus and end with \u201cnow help us kick our opponent\u2019s ass and keep us safe.\u201d\n\nDawna also was remembered for developing close community ties through her work with students, and Kiowa-Rain, who turned 18 two days before her death, was remembered as a loyal friend and peacemaker with a perpetual smile.\n\nThe teenager\u2019s relationship with her father was highlighted in a letter he wrote for her birthday, a letter read aloud by her older brother Dakota. The letter contained words of advice to Kiowa-Rain as she became an adult. Among them: \u201cdream big,\u201d \u201cdevelop a personal relationship with Jesus Christ\u201d and \u201cdeep, meaningful relationships bring happiness.\u201d\n\nDakota left the service carrying the ashes of his parents and younger sister in a wood box. Atop the box sat a small vial containing ashes of his two cousins, who were visiting from Missouri at the time of the slide.\n\nThe slide also injured 13-year-old Gracie Johnson, who attended Saturday\u2019s memorial wearing a cast on her leg and using a walker. She told rescuers her father saved her when he jumped on top of her as boulders began to crash down around them.\n\nSeparate services are being organized for the nephews in Missouri.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nInformation from: Chaffee County Times, http://www.chaffeecountytimes.com", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Hundreds gather to remember victims of rock slide", "title": "Hundreds gather to remember victims of rock slide", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2013/10/05/hundreds-gather-to-remember-victims-of-rock-slide/", "image": {"width": 324, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20131001__rockslidep1-1.jpg", "height": 265}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20131001__rockslidep1-1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2013-10-05T14:24:44+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-28T16:09:09+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "They were nephews of Dwayne and Dawna Johnson.\nMonday\u2019s slide across the trail to Agnes Vaille Falls in south-central Colorado\u2019s San Isabel National Forest killed Dwayne Johnson, 46, Dawna Johnson, 45, and their 18-year-old daughter, Kiowa-Rain Johnson, all of Buena Vista.\nBUENA VISTA, Colo.\u2014More than a thousand people gathered in a small Colorado mountain town Saturday to remember five members of the same family who were killed by a massive rock slide on a popular hiking trail.\nDwayne and Dawna Johnson were football and track coaches, respectively, in Buena Vista schools, and were well known in the town and very active in community events.\nThe other victims were identified as Baigen (BAY\u2019-zhun) Walker, 10, and Paris Walkup, 22, both of Birch Tree, Mo."}
