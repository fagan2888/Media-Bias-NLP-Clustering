Now it\u2019s getting them.\n\nWaffle House, the breakfast food chain with more than 1,750 locations in 25 states, has announced a new partnership with a small app-based delivery startup called Roadie, which is looking to become the Uber of package delivery.\n\nRoadie says its app \u201cconnects people with items to send with drivers who are already heading in the right direction.\u201d\n\n\u201cThink of us as the first neighbor-to-neighbor shipping network,\u201d Roadie\u2019s website reads. \u201cWe\u2019re building a faster, cheaper, friendlier way to get your stuff where it\u2019s going.\u201d\n\nRelated: The Great American Pilot Shortage\u200b\u200b\n\nWaffle House\u2019s 24-hour diners will serve as part of a network of meeting points for those senders and drivers, or drivers and package recipients \u2014 putting the restaurant chain firmly in the territory of FedEx, UPS and the U.S. Postal Service. Roadie drivers can get a free waffle for downloading the app and a free drink when they make a delivery (plus 80 percent of the fee Roadie gets, which reportedly will range from $12 to $200).\n\nRoadie just launched in the Southeast last month, and it\u2019s gotten $10 million in early investments from backers like Warren Stephens of Stephens Inc., Guggenheim Partners\u2019 Executive Chairman Alan Schwartz, Square Co-founder Jim McKelvey, Eric Schmidt\u2019s TomorrowVentures and even the UPS Strategic Enterprise Fund. (Yes, UPS, which dropped its memorable \u201cWhat can Brown do for you?\u201d campaign several years ago, is now asking what apps and waffles can do for you.) For now, though, the app has only been downloaded about 7,500 times, according to The Wall Street Journal, and Roadie drivers have only been asked to deliver about 50 items.\n\nRelated: The 10 Best Cities for Job Seekers\n\nRoadie will undoubtedly face some challenges as it looks to grow, like making sure drivers aren\u2019t used to deliver contraband or illegal items \u2014 an issue that has resulted in legal troubles for the much larger FedEx and UPS \u2014 and convincing would-be drivers to go out of their way, even briefly, for a few extra bucks.\n\nThe waffles might help. \u201cWaffle House provides a friendly, comfortable place for our folks to meet, and grab a plate of scattered, smothered and covered while they\u2019re at it,\u201d Marc Gorlin, the founder and CEO of Roadie, said in a statement announcing the deal.
