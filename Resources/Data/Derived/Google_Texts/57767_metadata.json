(Photo: Andrew Harnik / AP)\n\nTwo federal agencies just released some new research that probably isn\u2019t going over too well in the White House.\n\nIn its most recent baseline projections, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that 18 million people would have coverage through the Affordable Care Act\u2019s exchanges in 2025. That\u2019s 4 million fewer than it projected just last year.\n\nThe Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, meanwhile, recently revealed that 1 in 4 people who signed up for coverage at the beginning of 2015 dropped it by year\u2019s end.\n\nThe White House has tried to stay positive. This year\u2019s open enrollment period, which closed on January 31, yielded 12 million enrollees, up 2.6 percent from last year. That prompted Kevin Counihan, the CEO of the federal exchange HeathCare.gov, to boast, \u201cWe knocked the lights out this year.\u201d\n\nHis celebration may be premature. If last year\u2019s 25 percent attrition rate holds true again this year, total enrollment at the end of 2016 could be just 9.5 million \u2014 barely 700,000 people more than the final 2015 figure.\n\nAnd there\u2019s good reason to believe that this year\u2019s attrition rate will be even higher.\n\nPremiums have climbed significantly this year. Exchange shoppers in 17 states are facing average premium increases of 20 percent or more in 2016. According to Health and Human Services, the average premium for all plans purchased on HealthCare.gov is $408 \u2014 a 9 percent increase over last year.\n\nDeductibles have also climbed steadily. According to the online insurance marketplace HealthPocket, the average deductible for a silver plan \u2014 the most popular option on the exchanges \u2014 was $3,117 for individuals and $6,480 for families. Bronze plans, which often come with the lowest premiums, saw average deductibles reach $5,731 and $11,601 for the same groups.\n\nThe data seem to show that many young people are making just that calculation. Americans aged 18 to 34 comprised just 28 percent of enrollees this year \u2014 well below the administration\u2019s goal of 38 percent.\n\nThe reluctance of young Americans to enroll in exchange plans is a problem. The law needs premiums from young, generally healthy Americans to subsidize coverage for older patients, who generally need more care and are thus costlier to insure.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act\u2019s individual mandate was supposed to make sure that the exchange pool had plenty of young people. Under the law, Americans who fail to sign up this year face fines of $695 or 2.5 percent of their income, whichever is greater but still much lower than the cost of coverage.\n\nThe lack of young people in the exchanges is even more problematic because the rest of the exchange pool has turned out to be sicker than insurers expected.\n\nBlue Cross Blue Shield recently analyzed its members\u2019 claims data over the last two years. Those who enrolled in exchange plans had higher rates of illnesses like hypertension, diabetes, and Hepatitis C than folks with coverage pre-Obamacare did.\n\nTo compensate, insurers may be forced to hike premiums even higher \u2014 or to leave the exchanges because of unsustainable losses.\n\nThis year\u2019s exchange enrollment figures are nothing to brag about. If the Obama administration disagrees, they can take it up with their colleagues elsewhere in the federal government.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://detne.ws/1SAefXc", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "This year\u2019s exchange enrollment figures are nothing to brag about", "og": {"site_name": "Detroit News", "description": "This year\u2019s exchange enrollment figures are nothing to brag about", "title": "The coming collapse of health care exchanges", "url": "http://www.detroitnews.com/story/opinion/2016/04/22/collapse-health-care-exchange-obamacare/83415004/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/detroitnews.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "This year\u2019s exchange enrollment figures are nothing to brag about", "title": "The coming collapse of health care exchanges", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/df98413a770709437c6466f022d986ab80df0232/c=864-0-4320-3456&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2016/04/22/DetroitNews/B99384861Z.1_20160422202947_000_G5ITN4GK.1-0.jpg", "creator": "@detroitnews", "site": "@detroitnews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=904391631", "fb": {"app_id": 175422022549521}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": "Obamacare, health care, collapse"}, "article_summary": "This year\u2019s exchange enrollment figures are nothing to brag about, Pipes writes.\nThe reluctance of young Americans to enroll in exchange plans is a problem.\nThis year\u2019s exchange enrollment figures are nothing to brag about.\nIn its most recent baseline projections, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that 18 million people would have coverage through the Affordable Care Act\u2019s exchanges in 2025.\nThose who enrolled in exchange plans had higher rates of illnesses like hypertension, diabetes, and Hepatitis C than folks with coverage pre-Obamacare did."}
