Rand Paul (R-Ky) took aim at one of his most vocal critics and a rival for the GOP presidential nomination, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, at Yahoo's Digital Democracy conference on Thursday.\n\nIn an interview with Yahoo News' Oliver Knox, Paul blamed Christie's frequent misrepresentations of the senator's views on national security and government surveillance on a \"learning problem.\"\n\nYahoo News' Hunter Walker quotes Paul as saying:\n\n\u201cSome will respond and say, \u2018Well what about terrorists? Does that mean you don\u2019t care about terrorists?\u2019 And I tried to explain this to the governor from New Jersey on the stage, but I think I\u2019m having a little bit of a learning problem \u2014 learning curve,\u201d Paul said. \u201cYou can use the Fourth Amendment and still get terrorists.\u201d\n\nWalker adds:\n\nPaul also said he opposed the FBI\u2019s push to ban phone and email encryption and \u201cwithout question\u201d would allow Americans to obtain technology to protect their communications if he is elected president. He argued it is hard for people to trust that the government won\u2019t monitor them without obtaining proper warrants. Paul also suggested that creating a technological \u201cbackdoor\u201d to facilitate government surveillance programs would make Americans\u2019 Internet activity vulnerable to our \u201cenemies.\u201d \u201cThe head of the FBI came out with this recently, he says, \u2018Oh, we\u2019re going to ban encryption.\u2019 And it\u2019s like we want to build a backdoor into Facebook and a backdoor into Apple products,\u201d Paul said. \u201cA backdoor means that the government can look at your stuff, look at your information, your conversations. \u2026 The problem is, is that the moment you build an opening \u2014 and I\u2019m not an expert on coding or anything, but the moment you give a vulnerability to a code that someone can get into your source code, not only can the government, but so can your enemies, so can foreign governments.\u201d\n\nPaul's statements to Knox recall his dust-up with Christie over the Fourth Amendment and warrantless surveillance at the August 6th Republican presidential debate, where Christie fired an indirect shot at Paul, telling moderator Megyn Kelly, \"I will make no apologies, ever, for protecting the lives and safety of the American people. We have to give more tools to our folks to be able to do that, not fewer, and then trust those people and oversee them to do it the right way.\u201d\n\nTo which Paul replied:\n\nRAND PAUL: I want to collect more records from terrorists but less records from innocent Americans. The Fourth Amendment was what we fought the revolution over. John Adams said it was a spark that led to our war for independence. And I'm proud of standing for the Bill of Rights and I will continue to stand for the Bill of Rights. CHRIS CHRISTIE: Megyn, that's a completely ridiculous answer. I want to collect more records from terrorists but less records from other people. How are you supposed to know, Megyn? RAND PAUL: You get a warrant. Get a judge to sign a warrant. CHRISTIE: When you're sitting in a subcommittee blowing hot air about that you can say things like that. When you're responsible for protecting the lives of the American people, then you need to make sure that you use -- RAND PAUL: Here's the problem, governor. You fundamentally misunderstood the Bill of Rights. I'm talking about searches without warrants.\n\nIn 2013, following the narrow defeat of a Justin Amash-sponsored amendment to a House defense appropriations bill that would have defunded the NSA's bulk collection of phone records, Christie lamented, \"This strain of libertarianism that's going through both parties right now ... I think is a very dangerous thought.\"\n\nWriting at The Atlantic, Conor Friedersdorf takes issue with Christie's deterministic view that only allowing law enforcement to go to the dark side can ensure the safety of American citizens:\n\nIn fact, the phone dragnet has never stopped a single terrorist attack, during Chris Christie\u2019s tenure as a U.S. attorney or at any other time. For that reason, advocates of the phone dragnet wouldn\u2019t be apologizing for protecting our lives and safety\u2013\u2013they would be apologizing for abrogating our civil liberties with a surveillance program that didn\u2019t even make us any safer in the bargain. More generally, the torture of prisoners, the invasion of Iraq, the worst abuses of J. Edgar Hoover, and all the illegal behavior uncovered by the Church Committee were carried out by a lot of people who had the intent of protecting the lives of Americans. That intent does not excuse imprudent or unlawful acts\u2013\u2013and as a federal court has ruled, the provision of the Patriot Act that the NSA and the Obama Administration have used to justify the phone dragnet does not, in fact, even authorize it.\n\nThe \"strain of libertarianism\" which Christie calls \"dangerous\" is in fact a healthy skepiticism of the awesome and often unaccountable powers wielded by the federal government, which Paul also articulated at the Yahoo conference:\n\nPaul argued that people have no reason to believe the government isn\u2019t monitoring their private communications because Director of National Intelligence James Clapper \u201clied\u201d to Congress about surveillance. \u201cThere is a huge trust gap. The head of our intelligence \u2014 the intelligence director James Clapper \u2014 came to the Senate, and when he was asked, \u201cAre you collecting all of Americans\u2019 phone records?,\u201d he said no. He lied to us,\u201d Paul said, adding, \u201cThat\u2019s perjury. You can actually go to jail for what he did. He should have at the very least been fired, and he\u2019s still in that position.\u201d In his March 2013 testimony before Congress, Clapper incorrectly said the government doesn\u2019t collect any type of data on millions of Americans. A few months later, former government contractor Edward Snowden leaked files that revealed that the National Security Agency had a bulk data collection program.\n\nThis past June, Paul spoke with Reason magazine Editor-in-Chief Matt Welch for a Reason TV interview that dealt touching on his opposition the Patriot Act, the military hawks of his own party, and his thoughts on Edward Snowden.
