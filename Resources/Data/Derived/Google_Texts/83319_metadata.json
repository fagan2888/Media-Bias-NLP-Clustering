Kirk\u2019s raging ear infection, owners screw in this 10-inch-tall recording device into an adjustable desk stand with built-in shock mount.\n\nSEE ALSO: Zadzooks: Father\u2019s Day Gift Guide: Best gaming ideas for dad\n\nOnce plugged in, it delivers two different sonic options with the flick of a button. One recording setting is a crisp, powerful sound with enhanced low-frequency sensitivity for greater definition and one for greater clarity and detail for a tighter, more focused sound.\n\nIt works great with Apple\u2019s GarageBand (even conserving the iPad battery by only turning on when the app engages), and the included cables (Lightning and USB) feature an extended female headphone jack for direct monitoring and zero latency.\n\nThe Spark Digital also comes with a double-lined soft cloth case to keep the microphone and cords safe as the big guy captures his musing or musical performances on the road or in his office.\n\nSEE ALSO: Zadzooks: Father\u2019s Day Gift Guide - Best Blu-ray for dad\n\nDOCKr II (inNuevo, $149.95 reduced to $119.96 until Father\u2019s Day with free shipping) \u2014 If multitasking dad is not quite getting enough mobile functionality out of his iPad, he\u2019ll appreciate this flexible workstation.\n\nNearly turning Apple\u2019s famed tablet into a laptop, pop gets a clamshell, high-impact polycarbonate plastic case featuring an onboard battery along with Bluetooth-enabled speakers and a standard sized keyboard.\n\nOwners use the holder clips to attach the iPad either in portrait or landscape position and slide the top part of the case forward to keep the keyboard in place.\n\nThe lithium ion battery offers up to 8 extra hours of power through its onboard USB port to not only charge the iPad (perfect for a long plane flight) but other devices. The speakers are bass challenged but deliver up to 82 decibels of sound.\n\nInNuevo throws in two cables (one to charge the battery and the other to plug in an iPad compatible with a 30-pin connector) and two AC charger adapters. The shorter iPad cord can be stowed away in the bottom of the case.\n\nThe DOCKr also comes in five colors \u2014 absolute black, emerald green, midnight blue, pearl white and ruby red \u2014 that takes me back to the hue-enhanced days of Apple\u2019s original iBook.\n\nThe Championship Steak Grilling Set (GrillGrate LLC, $74.99) \u2014 The historic ritual of dad sweating over the preparation of the perfect piece of barbequed meat just got easier with this collection of high-tech helpers.\n\n\n\nZip open the red carrying case to first find an LT-03 infrared laser temperature gun (requires 9-volt battery, included) to point at grates and check for the optimum grill heat through its backlit LCD screen.\n\n\n\nNext, pull out the DT-09 waterproof digital thermometer to stab into the cooking meat and quickly check the proper inner temperature within an LCD readout to never serve an undercooked morsel.\n\n\n\nThe package also includes the less than high-tech magnetic meat temperature guide to stick on an unheated part of the grill.\n\n\n\nAdditionally, make life even easier for dad by throwing in a set of grill grates (starting at $39.99). These roughly 14-inch long interlocking aluminum plates with raised rails offer much more controlled conditions when cooking meats on a traditional grill.\n\n\n\nThey deliver even heat conduction, perfect aligned sear marks and best of all, it really protects a juicy chop from a direct blast of fire during flare ups.\n\n20V MAX Drill Driver (Black and Decker, $79.99) \u2014 The evolution of the tool used by homeowners to sink a finicky screw or make a precise hole continues with a drill smart enough to know when to stop.\n\n\n\nUnbelievably, Black and Decker\u2019s latest handheld effort, when set to \u201cdrive\u201d a screw, uses a microprocessor to analyze the rate of change in its torque profile as the screw enters the material and stops it flush within 3 milliseconds.\n\n\n\nLooking more like Flash Gordon\u2019s ray gun than drill, the lightweight design offers a rubber grip to counter hand fatigue for big jobs and an LED light at its bottom to illuminate a work area.\n\n\n\nThe drill\u2019s 0-to-800-RPM motor gets powered by a 20-volt lithium battery (with a handy recharge indicator on the top of the unit) and holds a charge up to 18 months. \u201cTool Time\u201d dads will be impressed.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Spark Digital, DOCKr, Championship Steak Grilling Set and the 20V MAX Drill Driver are some last-minute gift ideas.", "Author": "Joseph Szadkowski", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Spark Digital, DOCKr, Championship Steak Grilling Set and the 20V MAX Drill Driver are some last-minute gift ideas.", "title": "Zadzooks: Father\u2019s Day Gift Guide - Best gadgets for dad", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/jun/8/zadzooks-fathers-day-gift-guide-best-gadgets-dad/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/06/08/2014fd-grillset.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/06/08/2014fd-grillset.jpg", "title": "Zadzooks: Father\u2019s Day Gift Guide - Best gadgets for dad", "description": "Spark Digital, DOCKr, Championship Steak Grilling Set and the 20V MAX Drill Driver are some last-minute gift ideas.", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "news_keywords": "Technology Internet, Kirk"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd000f\"", "article_summary": "SEE ALSO: Zadzooks: Father\u2019s Day Gift Guide: Best gaming ideas for dadOnce plugged in, it delivers two different sonic options with the flick of a button.\nSEE ALSO: Zadzooks: Father\u2019s Day Gift Guide - Best Blu-ray for dadDOCKr II (inNuevo, $149.95 reduced to $119.96 until Father\u2019s Day with free shipping) \u2014 If multitasking dad is not quite getting enough mobile functionality out of his iPad, he\u2019ll appreciate this flexible workstation.\nFather\u2019s Day is just around the corner, and here are some last-minute gift suggestions for the dad who loves gadgets.\nThe package also includes the less than high-tech magnetic meat temperature guide to stick on an unheated part of the grill.\nKirk\u2019s raging ear infection, owners screw in this 10-inch-tall recording device into an adjustable desk stand with built-in shock mount."}
