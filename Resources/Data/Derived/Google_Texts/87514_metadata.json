In a youth soccer match, she was trying to head the ball into the goal when she collided with another player.\n\nHer mother, Beth, figures there were other concussions along the way but the worst came five years later, when Gracie crashed onto artificial turf, slamming the back of her head.\n\nNow 15, Gracie can no longer play soccer. She has headaches, suffers from inexplicable nausea and several times a day she feels like she\u2019s about to pass out.\n\n\u201cI had concussion symptoms all the time, but I didn\u2019t really know what they were so I wouldn\u2019t say anything,\u201d she said recently from her home in Memphis, Tennessee. \u201cI would see stars, like, probably every other game. But I didn\u2019t know that wasn\u2019t normal.\u201d\n\nWhile her athletic career may be over, Gracie and her mother have embarked on a new endeavor: Advocating for youth soccer coaches and organizations to keep headers out of the game until kids are 14.\n\nAt the Women\u2019s World Cup this summer, there will be a lot of young athletes hoping to someday emulate players like American Abby Wambach, who is known for heading the ball with uncanny accuracy.\n\nThe Safer Soccer Initiative recommends that those kids not be taught headers until they\u2019re high school age, after their brains and necks have had a chance to develop. The nearly year-old educational campaign is a joint effort between the Sports Legacy Institute, a concussion research and advocacy nonprofit, and the Santa Clara Institute of Sports Law and Ethics.\n\n___\n\nThere has been a growing focus on concussion prevention in hard-hitting youth sports, like football. But little attention has gone to soccer, where headers, and the acrobatics and resulting collisions that often come with them, are a leading cause of concussions, said Dr. Robert Cantu, professor of neurosurgery at Boston University School of Medicine.\n\nA study published in the American Journal of Sports Medicine in 2012 showed that football had the greatest incidence of concussions among high school athletes. Girls\u2019 soccer was second.\n\n\u201cIf it weren\u2019t for headers, soccer wouldn\u2019t be in the high-risk group for head injury, and it is, surprisingly. Many people don\u2019t realize that,\u201d Cantu said. \u201cGirls are particularly prone to concussions compared to guys.\u201d\n\nPart of the danger is that no one knows just when or how a brain injury, or multiple injuries, can result in permanent damage, Cantu said.\n\nThe Sports Legacy Institute was involved in identifying the first case of chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a degenerative brain disease known as CTE, in a soccer player after examining the brain of Patrick Grange, an aspiring pro known for his headers who died in 2012 at age 29.\n\nCantu, who wrote \u201cConcussions And Our Kids,\u201d isn\u2019t suggesting that kids shouldn\u2019t play soccer, he just believes they should do it more safely, especially in formative years.\n\nOne of the first to jump on the effort was Brandi Chastain, a former star with the U.S. national team who scored the winning penalty kick to give the United States the title over China in the 1999 World Cup. Now she is a youth coach in Northern California, and a mom.\n\nChastain believes that if youth coaches can reduce the risk of concussions by focusing on footwork and special awareness rather than headers, it will also allow players to develop stronger fundamental skills.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Concussions drive movement to curb headers in youth soccer", "title": "Concussions drive movement to curb headers in youth soccer", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Concussions drive movement to curb headers in youth soccer", "title": "Concussions drive movement to curb headers in youth soccer", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/06/07/concussions_drive_movement_to_curb_headers_in_youth_soccer/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/06/reconsidering-the-header.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Concussions drive movement to curb headers in youth soccer", "title": "Concussions drive movement to curb headers in youth soccer", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/06/reconsidering-the-header.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Anne M.
