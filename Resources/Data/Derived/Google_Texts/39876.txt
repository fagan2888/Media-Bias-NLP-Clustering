Â— Kansas Gov. Sam Brownback is throwing his support behind Republican Sen. Marco Rubio for president.

The governor issued a news release Monday endorsing Rubio, of Florida, as a "true conservative" who can unite the party and beat the Democratic nominee in the fall.

Brownback also lauded Rubio's "proven track record of protecting life, defending religious liberty and undoing Obamacare."
