It compared the premiums for bronze, silver, gold and platinum plans sold on the federal exchange.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the study:\n\nBronze and gold provider-owned plans were 13 percent more expensive than the cheapest bronze and gold plans not owned by providers.\n\nThe cheapest bronze plan in Bernalillo County, New Mexico was $67.79 more expensive per month than the cheapest bronze plan not owned by a provider.\n\nFor the most popular option offered on Healthcare.gov--the silver plan--the least expensive provider-owned plans were $27.33 per month more expensive on average than the least expensive plans not owned by providers. What's more, the benchmark cost of a silver plan is expected to rise, on average, 4.4 percent next year.\n\nIn eight of the 12 counties studied, the cheapest silver plan was not a provider-owned plan.\n\nThe cheapest gold plan was a provider-owned plan in only two of the 12 counties examined.\n\nOnly three of the 12 counties had provider-owned platinum plans; 10 of the 12 counties had platinum plans not owned by providers.\n\nThese results indicate that healthcare reform may not necessarily produce the imagined cost-saving results, HealthPocket concludes in its analysis. Though \"with respect to provider-owned health plans, the lack of premium advantage does not call into question the value of the model altogether,\" it notes.\n\nFor more:\n\n- here's the survey\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nPayers positioned to lead alternative payment model transformation\n\nSigns point to rise in premiums for benchmark silver plans", "article_metadata": {"description": "Though provider-owned health plans are intented to hasten the transition from a\u00a0fee-for-service\u00a0payment model to\u00a0value-based care, these types of plans don't seem to produce lower premiums, according to a new HealthPocket\u00a0study.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthPayer", "description": "Though provider-owned health plans are intented to hasten the transition from a\u00a0fee-for-service\u00a0payment model to\u00a0value-based care, these types of plans don't seem to produce lower premiums, according to a new HealthPocket\u00a0study.", "title": "Provider-owned health plans don't offer lower premiums", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthpayer.com/story/provider-owned-health-plans-dont-offer-lower-premiums/2015-08-21", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthpayer.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "healthpayer", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "keywords": "bronze plans,fee-for-service,gold plans,non provider-owned plans,Operations & Business Management,platinum plans,provider-owned plans,silver plans,value-based care", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Operations & Business Management"}, "article_summary": "Only three of the 12 counties had provider-owned platinum plans; 10 of the 12 counties had platinum plans not owned by providers.\nThe study compared premiums for 40-year-old individuals who purchased provider-owned Affordable Care Act plans versus ACA plans not owned by providers in 12 counties nationwide with both types of plans.\nIn eight of the 12 counties studied, the cheapest silver plan was not a provider-owned plan.\nFor the most popular option offered on Healthcare.gov--the silver plan--the least expensive provider-owned plans were $27.33 per month more expensive on average than the least expensive plans not owned by providers.\nThough provider-owned health plans are intented to hasten the transition from a fee-for-service payment model to value-based care, these types of plans don't seem to produce lower premiums, according to a new HealthPocket study."}
