The prospect of a plaintiff victory in an upcoming U.S. Supreme Court decision concerning the Affordable Care Act has "sent a chill through HCA's corporate coffers and the hospital industry as a whole," McClatchy DC News reports, referring to Nashville, Tenn.-based Hospital Corp. of America.

Plaintiffs in King v. Burwell contend that residents in 34 states that rely on federal healthcare exchanges to comply with the ACA are not eligible for tax credits to subsidize their insurance. Nearly 4.9 million people are likely to become uninsured if plaintiffs prevail, according to the report, citing Urban Institute predictions.

HCA, with seven medical facilities in Louisiana, is the largest private hospital management firm in the country. Nearly 90 percent of HCA facilities are in affected states, according to the report. Complicating matters for HCA is that 13 of the 15 federal-exchange states in which the company operates - including Louisiana -- have not expanded Medicaid, the report notes.

Medicaid expansion, along with the federal and state exchanges, is how the law envisions financing massive cuts in federal reimbursements for uncompensated care.

Locally, HCA is in talks with Jefferson Parish to lease East Jefferson General Hospital, a long-awaited deal that appeared dead for most of last year until it was revived in recent months.

The court heard arguments in King v. Burwell on March 4, and a decision is expected within three months.
