Yet, the world's largest maker of commercial aircraft has decided to blame the closure of the U.S. Export Import (Ex-Im) Bank for its decision to lay off \"several hundred\" employees at its satellite division in El Segundo, Calif.\n\nAccording to the Los Angeles Times, Boeing said the cuts were needed after the Bermuda-based global satellite operator ABS couldn't get financing from Ex-Im. This decision stands in stark contrast to multiple public commitments from senior Boeing officials that it would be able to \"cover\" or self-finance its own transactions once the bank expired \u2014 but it would just rather not have to do that.\n\nAs recently as this summer, Boeing's new CEO Dennis Muilenberg assured investors during a conference call on Boeing's second-quarter earnings that, should Ex-Im expire, \"There are multiple commercial credit sources available today.\"\n\nIn 2013, when the bank was originally scheduled to expire, the managing director of Boeing's financing arm, Kostya Zolotusky, also said he was confident the company could find alternative funding sources for customers, according to The Wall Street Journal.\n\nStay abreast of the latest developments from nation's capital and beyond with curated News Alerts from the Washington Examiner news desk and delivered to your inbox.

But according to recent reports, Boeing admitted that while it has the ability to tap its own commercial-financing organizations to save the satellite deals, it likely won't. It seems that rather than save the transaction and the jobs in El Segundo, Boeing prefers to make a political statement in Washington, D.C., and blame the loss of government subsidies.\n\nIf these transactions aren't worth saving by Boeing itself, taxpayers should not be on the hook for providing these loans.\n\nThe threat of layoffs may be a ploy to scare members of Congress because Boeing may not even have to layoff employees. Boeing spokesman Tim Neale has pointed out that some employees might not be let go entirely, and would instead find work in other areas of Boeing. He has also stated that the layoffs are \"necessary to remain competitive for ongoing and future business,\" according to Reuters. It's also worth noting that Boeing laying off workers in California is nothing new \u2014 over the past decade alone, they've let go 18,332 of their 35,000 California employees.\n\nSo which is it? Boeing can finance these transactions but, based on a cost-benefit analysis, made the business decision that this satellite deal isn't worth financing itself in order to maintain jobs in California? A leaner business model is \"necessary to remain competitive?\" Or maybe Boeing just doesn't want to cut into the average $16 million per year it spends to lobby members of Congress for these sweetheart deals.\n\nBoeing can't decide what its story is, other than that it wants its taxpayer subsidies back. And, the fact is that most crony capitalist companies want more government giveaways to pad their bottom line, which is not in the interest of taxpayers or a thriving free market.\n\nHard-working taxpayers and those elected to represent us must stay strong. Keep this institution of corporate welfare closed for good.\n\nDavid Williams is president of the Taxpayers Protection Alliance. Thinking of submitting an op-ed to the Washington Examiner?
