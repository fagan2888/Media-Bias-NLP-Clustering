The company said that its new Minnetonka office will allow it to tap local insurance talent to assist its customers.\u201cThere is a deep pool of executive management, underwriting, and actuarial talent throughout the Minnesota region,\u201d David Sipprell, president of Munich Re\u2019s managed care unit, said in a statement. \u201cAt the same time, many of our clients also reside in this area, so it makes perfect sense for us to have a permanent presence here.\u201dSipprell will head the Minnetonka office, which will be staffed by eight employees. Munich Re spokesman Robert Aristarco told Twin Cities Business that the company has a three-year plan to hire a total of 15. He added that while the company is \u201calways looking at potential new locations,\u201d there aren\u2019t current plans for additional Minnesota offices.Munich Re said that changes to how heath care is financed and delivered, resulting from the Affordable Care Act (ACA), motivated the company's expansion to Minnesota. According to Aristarco, under the ACA, hospitals and medical service providers will require greater risk management expertise and capital to ensure that they can provide the services promised to patients.\u201cMunich Re is well-positioned to support its clients in evaluating and protecting their risk position as they work their way through the ACA maze,\u201d Donna Peterson, president and CEO of Munich Health North America, said in a statement.Munich Re reported approximately $70.2 billion in premium income (income earned through option sales), of which roughly $37.9 billion was from its reinsurance operations, during its most recently completed fiscal year. It employs more than 45,000 worldwide and maintains nearly 50 international locations.", "article_metadata": {"document-title": "German Insurance Co.
