He offered (roughly) two insights:\n\nHe may just burn that one-of-a-kind Wu Tang Clan album he bought for $2 million (this was not well-received).\n\nHe thinks there\u2019s a \u201c100 percent chance\u201d of a movie based off his life (or, perhaps more appropriate, his current predicament). He expects Benedict Cumberbatch or Tobey Maguire to play him.\n\nShkreli\u2019s forays into social media are pretty well chronicled. On Saturday night he was on Blab, where he\u2019s a bit more of a regular, and switched on Periscope at the same time.\n\nThis is the first I\u2019ve watched a Shkreli stream at length and it is a surreal, vexing experience. The Blab broadcast \u2013 billed as a \u201croast\u201d of Shkreli \u2013 was largely dominated by the non-stop opinions of the self-styled rare-disease advocate Candace Lerman. Meanwhile, most of the comments on Periscope were asking about the Wu Tang clan album (at this point, Shkreli is a first-rate hedge-fund guy, an anarchist pharma executive, and a C-list pop-culture celeb).\n\nShkreli, for the most part, seemed completely bored: periodically answering viewer questions, drinking wine, playing his drums and suggesting he\u2019d like someone to \u201ccome over and keep me warm.\u201d\n\nWhy does he do it? He seems bored and these stints are simply methadone for an attention addiction.\n\nSomeone did ask him about testifying in front of Congress. Shkreli\u2019s response: No comment, adding: \u201cGet that camera out of my face.\u201d\n\n#irony", "article_metadata": {"description": "Oh, and he may just burn that Wu Tang clan album.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "MedCity News", "description": "Oh, and he may just burn that Wu Tang clan album.", "title": "Who will play Martin Shkreli in a \u2018100 percent\u2019 happening Martin Shkreli movie?", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://medcitynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/shkreli_periscope1.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-01-24T12:26:13-04:00", "url": "http://medcitynews.com/2016/01/who-will-play-martin-shkreli-in-a-100-percent-happening-martin-shkreli-movie/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://medcitynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/shkreli_periscope1.jpg", "description": "Oh, and he may just burn that Wu Tang clan album.", "card": "summary", "title": "Martin Shkreli: I may just burn that Wu Tang album"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 148725768475669}, "article": {"section": "Biotech", "tag": "Martin Shkreli", "published_time": "2016-01-24T11:54:12-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-01-24T12:26:13-04:00"}, "keywords": "weight loss, obesity, overweight,diabetes,massachusetts,medical devices,obesity,startups,healthcare innovation, medcity news,medcity news,san francisco, startups, life sciences,accelerator,rock health,startup advice,startup funding,patient monitoring system, motion sensors ,dc,healthcare it,washington,foodborne pathogens, diagnostics company, diagnostic platforms,minimally invasive surgery, laser surgery,cambridge,dealflow,hospitals,wellpoint, healthways, health and wellness, employee wellness programs,investing,wellness,medtronic, shanghai innovation center, china, r&d,china,mdt,minneapolis,minnesota,publics,twin cities,ulcerative colitis, abbott labs, humira,abbott labs,doctors,pharmaceuticals,skin disorders, pharmaceuticals, md anderson cancer center,cancer,texas,renal denervation, st. jude medical,st. jude medical,stj,emr, ehr, electronic health records, electronic medical records, certified emr,certified emr,ehr,electronic health records,electronic medical records,advanced cellular technology,amyotrophic lateral sclerosis,embryonic stem cells,geron corporation,lou gehrig\\'s disease,macular degeneration,regenerative medicine,spinal cord damage,value-based healthcare system, obamacare, fee-for-service model,california,cleveland,health insurance,insurance,ohio,pennsylvania,politics,cancer treatment options library, aetna, aet, healthcare it,aet,aetna,health it,phi,philadelphia,fashion, FInance, government, Healthcare Social Media, law, Martin Shkreli, , MedCity News", "google-site-verification": "xudQg7nxVR9ifmMTY4Tf-0wVtX9b6rWLQd0utCweGOc", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,width=device-width,user-scalable=no,minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "He offered (roughly) two insights:He may just burn that one-of-a-kind Wu Tang Clan album he bought for $2 million (this was not well-received).\nMeanwhile, most of the comments on Periscope were asking about the Wu Tang clan album (at this point, Shkreli is a first-rate hedge-fund guy, an anarchist pharma executive, and a C-list pop-culture celeb).\nPharma scourge and the Democratic presidential candidates\u2019 dream villain Martin Shkreli took to the livestreaming service Periscope for the first time this weekend.\nHe thinks there\u2019s a \u201c100 percent chance\u201d of a movie based off his life (or, perhaps more appropriate, his current predicament).\nThe Blab broadcast \u2013 billed as a \u201croast\u201d of Shkreli \u2013 was largely dominated by the non-stop opinions of the self-styled rare-disease advocate Candace Lerman."}
