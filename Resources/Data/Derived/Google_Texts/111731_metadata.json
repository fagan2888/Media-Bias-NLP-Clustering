(WANE) \u2013 One of the unions representing some Fort Wayne city employees filed a lawsuit against the city, Mayor Tom Henry and five other city officials, claiming the city didn\u2019t follow it\u2019s collective bargaining ordinance.\n\nThe suit submitted by the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 723 was opened Friday, May 9 and filed Thursday, May 15 in Allen County Superior Court, according to court records. Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief 5-2-2014\n\nBruce Getts, the business manager for IBEW Local 723, said the litigation stems from contract negotiations that broke down between the union and the city last November.\n\nGetts said after one meeting with city representatives, Fort Wayne\u2019s city attorney sent him a letter saying they were terminating their agreement and canceling negotiations for the rest of the year. That, Getts said, is a violation of the city\u2019s collective bargaining agreement.\n\n\u201cThey are obligated to bargain in good faith,\u201d he said. \u201cIf they followed the rules of collective bargaining and the laws that govern the process there wouldn\u2019t be a lawsuit.\u201d\n\nThe court documents said last year city code changed to exempt seasonal employees from unions and changed some benefits, like sick time and health care. But, they were never negotiated into IBEW\u2019s contract.\n\n\u201cThey canceled the rest of our negotiation sessions we had scheduled for rest of the year so we never got a chance to negotiate anything. Once again, the collective bargaining ordinance requires the contract to stay in full force and effect through the process,\u201d Getts said.\n\nThe lawsuit is an injunction against those changes and would force the city to follow the collective bargaining ordinance and return to negotiations.\n\n\u201cIn the private sector what they did would be illegal and we\u2019d have help from the National Labor Relations Act. But in the public sector, we have to use the courts,\u201d Getts said.\n\nLast Tuesday, three ordinances were introduced to city council that would change or eliminate collective bargaining. Getts said this lawsuit is unrelated.\n\n\u201cIt has nothing to do with the ordinances being introduced. This has been going on since last summer. The city backed us into a corner,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m doing nothing more than what I need to do to represent my members. If [the city] had agreed to keep negotiating, we wouldn\u2019t have had to file a lawsuit.\u201d\n\nRepublican Councilman John Crawford (At-Large) said the lawsuit illustrates his point that collective bargaining is time consuming and expensive.\n\n\u201cWithout collective bargaining there would be no lawsuit,\u201d Crawford said. \u201cThey\u2019re making some disputes that the city attorney didn\u2019t give proper notice and she says she did and she\u2019s a very good lawyer. That\u2019s something that will be settled in courts. They make my case for me. You can\u2019t make any changes, even small ones, under collective bargaining without having problems and resistance. Now because of the suit the city has to pay the expenses of defending the lawsuit.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe councilmen certainly think it hurts us. It gives them something to paint a negative light on. I don\u2019t view it as being negative. We have an obligation in our contract to represent our members and that\u2019s all that\u2019s going on here,\u201d Getts said.\n\nThe city council voted to introduce the ordinances on May 13 by a vote of 6-2 with one absent. Council will hear presentations for and against the measures at its meeting on May 20. A vote is expected on May 27. Mayor Tom Henry is expected to veto the ordinances if they pass out of council. A special session for a potential override vote would be scheduled either on June 3, 9 or 10, Crawford said.\n\nRelated Stories:\n\nCity Council could repeal collective bargaining\n\nCollective bargaining changes will bring big debate\n\nCouncil votes to introduce collective bargaining reform ordinances\n\nUnion: Collective bargaining changes could affect public safety\n\nMayor Henry would veto ordinances that would end collective bargaining", "article_metadata": {"description": "One of the unions representing some Fort Wayne city employees filed a lawsuit against the city, Mayor Tom Henry and five other city officials, claiming the city didn't follow it's collective bargaining ordinance.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.linmedia.newstouch.wane", "og": {"site_name": "WANE", "description": "One of the unions representing some Fort Wayne city employees filed a lawsuit against the city, Mayor Tom Henry and five other city officials, claiming the city didn\u2019t follow it\u2019s colle\u2026", "title": "IBEW Local 723 files suit against Fort Wayne", "url": "http://wane.com/2014/05/18/ibew-local-723-files-suit-against-fort-wayne/", "image": {"width": 660, "identifier": "https://lintvwane.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/ibew-lawsuit.jpg?w=1200", "height": 371}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "One of the unions representing some Fort Wayne city employees filed a lawsuit against the city, Mayor Tom Henry and five other city officials, claiming the city didn\u2019t follow it\u2019s colle\u2026", "creator": "@wane15", "image": {"src": "https://lintvwane.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/ibew-lawsuit.jpg?w=640"}, "title": "IBEW Local 723 files suit against Fort Wayne", "site": "wane15", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "Fort Wayne News, Weather and Sports", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=488222080", "fb": {"pages": 54012016429}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "application-name": "WANE", "google-site-verification": "lNZPWZeGC4zNForuuJZt1-sG4pyZKEfDzOHjOenyArg", "msvalidate.01": "25404283363C09DE121A55A903F03873", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wane15", "published_time": "2014-05-18T21:14:36+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-05-28T14:56:17+00:00"}, "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://wane.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/2fd549580f5e4635901cf55d62e47240?s=16"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2b5b\"", "article_summary": "Related Stories:City Council could repeal collective bargainingCollective bargaining changes will bring big debateCouncil votes to introduce collective bargaining reform ordinancesUnion: Collective bargaining changes could affect public safetyMayor Henry would veto ordinances that would end collective bargaining\nOnce again, the collective bargaining ordinance requires the contract to stay in full force and effect through the process,\u201d Getts said.\nLast Tuesday, three ordinances were introduced to city council that would change or eliminate collective bargaining.\nThat, Getts said, is a violation of the city\u2019s collective bargaining agreement.\nYou can\u2019t make any changes, even small ones, under collective bargaining without having problems and resistance."}
