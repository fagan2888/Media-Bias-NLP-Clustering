Bush. The process is not always pretty \u2014 at times, in fact, it is downright chilling. But now that we know some of the harrowing details of what was done in our name, it\u2019ll be easier for us Americans to step a bit closer to the mirror and see what we\u2019ve become. As Glenn Greenwald put it earlier this week, \u201cEverybody\u2019s noses got rubbed in [the torture program] by this report.\u201d\n\nStill, the human brain has an awesome capacity to reject information it finds upsetting \u2014 like proof that one\u2019s leaders embraced practices refined by the Bolsheviks and the Gestapo. At least that\u2019s my explanation for why some people would rather talk about alleged partisanship than \u201crectal rehydration.\u201d Or why there\u2019s been increasing focus on the question of whether the CIA \u201cmisled\u201d President Bush about the effectiveness of the program, as well as its essential nature. The whining from conservatives over the Committee not interviewing CIA agents is a red herring, of course (as Chris Hayes has noted, arguments about process are almost uniformly disingenuous). But I think the chatter about Bush the Younger really being Bush the Clueless gets to something deeper.\n\nBefore we get into that, though, let\u2019s lay out the basic thrust of the Bush-as-patsy narrative. The key data point for the argument, which the report\u2019s authors say is based on the CIA\u2019s own records, is the fact that Bush wasn\u2019t officially briefed on the agency\u2019s use of waterboarding until 2006. By that point, CIA agents had been subjecting \u201cmore than three dozen prisoners\u201d to a series of \u201cnear drownings\u201d for years. The report also found that when the president was told of some of the program\u2019s details \u2014 specifically, the practice of chaining alleged \u201cevildoers\u201d to the ceiling and forcing them to soil themselves \u2014 he \u201cexpressed discomfort.\u201d He was, after all, the ultimate compassionate conservative.\n\nAdmittedly, there\u2019s much in this formulation that\u2019s seductive, confirming as it does a few widely held beliefs about Bush and his administration. For one thing, it jibes perfectly with the trope that depicts Bush as little more than a figurehead, the emptiest of suits. For another, because the torture program has been so vociferously defended by the former vice president, the story also seems to confirm the related suspicion that, for most of the Bush era, Dick Cheney was the real president. Last but not least, the idea that Bush was kept in the dark (not literally; that was reserved for detainees) lines up with another popular Bush motif: that he was, at least for a commander-in-chief, a \u201cregular guy,\u201d just like us, and not a sadistic authoritarian.\n\nTo paraphrase CIA Director John Brennan\u2019s remarks this week, what Bush knew and when he knew it is \u201cunknowable\u201d to the rest of us. And to some extent, depending on how much \u201cdiscomfort\u201d he feels over being a war criminal, it may not even be knowable to him. All the same, there are a few signs that the Bush-as-patsy explanation is a little too pat. And there are historical reasons to believe that he not only knew enough to be culpable, but that he purposefully avoided finding out more than the bare minimum of what he needed. As Andrew Sullivan put it recently, there was \u201ca desire not to know, not to have direct and explicit knowledge of what was actually being done, because of the immense gravity of the crimes.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The debate over what Bush knew (and when he knew it) is important \u2014 but more for what it says about our own guilt", "title": "Bush\u2019s willful ignorance: Why he wanted to know as little about torture as possible", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The debate over what Bush knew (and when he knew it) is important \u2014 but more for what it says about our own guilt", "title": "Bush\u2019s willful ignorance: Why he wanted to know as little about torture as possible", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/12/13/bushs_willful_ignorance_why_he_wanted_to_know_as_little_about_torture_as_possible/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/12/bush_cheney.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The debate over what Bush knew (and when he knew it) is important \u2014 but more for what it says about our own guilt", "title": "Bush\u2019s willful ignorance: Why he wanted to know as little about torture as possible", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/12/bush_cheney.jpg", "creator": "@eliasisquith", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Elias Isquith", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, abu zubaydah, Andrew Sullivan, Barton Gellman, Dick Cheney, Editor's Picks, George W.
