No thoughts of violence, self-deprecation, or hopelessness. My life would be different today.\u201d\n\nMedical marijuana is legal in 23 states and the District of Columbia. California allows doctors to recommend it for a broad range of conditions, including arthritis, migraines and \u201cany other illness for which marijuana provides relief,\u201d according to the language of the 1996 ballot initiative that made the state the first to allow medical marijuana.\n\nIllinois law lists dozens of diseases, including cancer, multiple sclerosis and AIDS, that can qualify a patient for use with a doctor\u2019s recommendation and a state ID card. However, it is more restrictive than in other states, and the marijuana industry wants a broader list to create a bigger market in Illinois.\n\nThe Illinois Department of Public Health must approve any additions to the list. An advisory board made up of patients, nurses, doctors and a pharmacist is reviewing the petitions and will make a recommendation after holding a public hearing May 4.\n\nPeople can submit petitions twice annually, in January and July.\n\nThe board will be \u201ccautious and conservative\u201d as it considers research, the severity of the illnesses, other remedies available and what other states have done, said Dr. Leslie Mendoza Temple, a suburban Chicago doctor and the board\u2019s chair.\n\n\u201cWe will not be able to approve all conditions,\u201d she said.\n\nOne factor the board will not consider is the wishes of marijuana business owners, Dr. Temple said. Regulations and the board\u2019s bylaws forbid board members from having financial ties with the medical cannabis industry, she noted.\n\nPetitioners made the case for conditions including bipolar disorder, autism, psoriasis, chronic back pain, gout and osteoarthritis. Some said they already use marijuana illegally to find relief or they believe they know how it would help their condition:\n\n-\u201cWhen I use cannabis, all of my intestinal muscles relax which provides immediate relief,\u201d wrote a person favoring the inclusion of irritable bowel syndrome.\n\n-\u201cCannabis will help me to sleep better, and it will help alleviate pain naturally,\u201d wrote a person with chronic back pain.\n\n-\u201cCannabis would cause my mind to stop obsessive thoughts and it could help me conquer my fears,\u201d wrote a person with obsessive compulsive disorder.\n\nSome petitions mention research done in Israel and other countries. U.S. research on marijuana is limited by federal constraints, but more studies are coming.\n\nColorado will spend more than $8 million researching marijuana\u2019s medical potential, awarding grants for studies on treating epilepsy, brain tumors, Parkinson\u2019s disease and post-traumatic stress disorder. Some of the studies still need federal approval.\n\nThe Illinois advisory board is well aware of the limits on research, said Dr. Temple, the board chair.\n\n\u201cWhere science is lacking we must factor in our compassion more heavily,\u201d Dr. Temple said.\n\n\u2022 Online: Medical Cannabis Pilot Program website: http://mcpp.illinois.gov", "article_metadata": {"description": "Illinois residents have petitioned the state to add more than 20 medical conditions to the medical marijuana program, including anxiety, migraines, insomnia and post-traumatic stress disorder.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Illinois residents have petitioned the state to add more than 20 medical conditions to the medical marijuana program, including anxiety, migraines, insomnia and post-traumatic stress disorder.", "title": "Illinois mulls expanded disease list for marijuana program", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/apr/6/petitioners-seek-longer-disease-list-for-illinois-/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/04/06/AP902596860205.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/04/06/AP902596860205.jpg", "description": "Illinois residents have petitioned the state to add more than 20 medical conditions to the medical marijuana program, including anxiety, migraines, insomnia and post-traumatic stress disorder.", "card": "summary", "title": "Illinois mulls expanded disease list for marijuana program"}, "Author": "Carla K.
