This, says executive director Arthur Lerman, means a savings of 30 to 50 percent for each ride.\n\nThe hope is that these new prices will attract more users, and the higher volume can offset any loss of operating revenue.\n\nLerman, who took over at iTNSarasota a year ago when the nonprofit's future looked shaky, was able to get cars and drivers back on the road and rebuild membership. Along the way, he says, leadership of the organization has continued to evolve.\n\n\"There were some on the board who were feeling uneasy about our situation,\" he acknowledges. \"They respectfully resigned, and we moved forward. The reality is that most nonprofits rely on bringing in grant money and donations, and you have to have a certain amount of patience and faith.\"\n\nJust recently, the organization \u2014 part of iTNAmerica, a community-based transportation model designed to serve people 60 and older \u2014 was able to share two more pieces of good news.\n\nOne is the renewal, for another year, of its Rides in Sight program, which pays for free trips to the eye doctor. Underwritten by Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, which makes a drug to treat macular degeneration, the program also covers all but $10 of the ITN annual membership fee.\n\nIf you don't yet belong to iTN and are interested in a free lift to your eye doctor's office, call Rides in Sight at (855) 607-4337 to sign up for the program. The Rides in Sight will then refer you to iTNSarasota.\n\nIf you are already a member, call Dawn at the iTNSarasota office for details, at 364-7530.\n\nAlso, in April, the organization will launch a six-month pilot project with the Jefferson Center, a low-cost housing community in Sarasota for people 62 and older. Residents there will be eligible for reduced-rate rides, without paying the annual membership fee of $50 ($75 for families). The group's Road Scholarship Fund will subsidize the experiment, meant to be a model that can be replicated in other parts of Sarasota and Venice.\n\nThis project reflects the reconstituted board's focus on ways to expand access to the ride service, Lerman says, while \"creating a new level of stability.\"\n\nOn-demand ride services like uber have potential to be part of the equation for elders in the future, he thinks, and iTNAmerica has been in talks with uber.\n\n\"Our goal is to be one of the long-term solutions for seniors in meeting transportation needs,\" he says. \"Our focus is very simple and very clear: to give people access to transportation so they can continue to live full lives. It doesn't matter how that happens. To the extent that we can partner with somebody else, so be it.\"\n\nLerman admits that even with iTN's current software, matching up volunteer drivers with elders who need rides is something of a daily miracle.\n\n\"The challenge is the perennial challenge; we simply need more volunteer drivers,\" Lerman says. \"People can commit to as little as an hour or two a month. Car donations are also important, but at the very top of the list is more volunteers.\"\n\nThose who give their time to driving fellow community members around town are reimbursed for their mileage expense. More important, they receive transportation credits, which they can donate to someone in need of the service \u2014 or save up to use when their own time behind the wheel comes to an end, as it does for us all.\n\nOf course, money helps too. If you're the kind who likes to do your bit without leaving the house, you may be interested in attending iTNSarasota's fund-raising \"nonevent.\"\n\n\"The dinner, dance, silent and live auction will NOT take place on April 10,\" reads the website, itnsarasota.org. \"Please RSVP by April 1.\" Among other benefits of making a donation from the comfort of your home or office, the site lists a savings of $1,500 for a new dress and $500 on a tux.\n\nYou won't even need to call for a ride.", "article_metadata": {"wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe050f\"", "article_summary": "This project reflects the reconstituted board's focus on ways to expand access to the ride service, Lerman says, while \"creating a new level of stability.\"\nContrary to any rumors you might have heard, the elder ride service iTNSarasota remains alive and well, and is offering its passengers a rate reduction beginning this Wednesday.\nLerman admits that even with iTN's current software, matching up volunteer drivers with elders who need rides is something of a daily miracle.\nOne is the renewal, for another year, of its Rides in Sight program, which pays for free trips to the eye doctor.\nThis, says executive director Arthur Lerman, means a savings of 30 to 50 percent for each ride."}
