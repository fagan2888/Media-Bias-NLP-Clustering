The high court issued a favorable ruling in Sebelius v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc., a landmark case addressing the Constitutionally guaranteed rights of business owners to operate their family companies without violating their deeply held religious convictions.\n\nThe court ruled that the contraception mandate violated the Religious Freedom and Restoration Act, a 1993 law and it held that the mandate \u201csubstantially burdens the exercise of religion\u201d and that HHS didn\u2019t use the \u201cleast restrictive means\u201d to promote this government interest, tests required by RFRA.\n\n\u201cHHS\u2019s contraception mandate substantially burdens the exercise of religion,\u201d the decision reads, adding that the \u201cdecision concerns only the contraceptive mandate and should not be understood to mean that all insurance mandates.\u201d The opinion said the \u201cplain terms of Religious Freedom Restoration Act\u201d are \u201cperfectly clear.\u201d\n\nNow, Senate Democrats want to change the Religious Freedom and Restoration Act in a way that would force companies to pay for birth control, contraception and those abortion-causing drugs.\n\nSenators Mark Udall (D-Colo.) and Patty Murray (D-Wash.), both abortion advocates, are behind the new legislation and they said, \u201cThe Protect Women\u2019s Health from Corporate Interference Act would ban employers from refusing to provide health coverage \u2014 including contraceptive coverage \u2014 guaranteed to their employees and dependents under federal law.\u201d\n\n\u201cAfter five justices decided last week that an employer\u2019s personal views can interfere with women\u2019s access to essential health services, we in Congress need to act quickly to right this wrong,\u201d Murray said. \u201cThis bicameral legislation will ensure that no CEO or corporation can come between people and their guaranteed access to health care, period. I hope Republicans will join us to revoke this court-issued license to discriminate and return the right of Americans to make their own decisions, about their own health care and their own bodies.\u201d\n\nNot one Senate Republican has signed on to the legislation, which pro-life groups will undoubtedly strenuously oppose. House Republicans will not take up the bill, making it so the legislation will not reach President Barack Obama, an abortion advocate who would sign it into law.\n\nIn their ruling, the Supreme Court indicated Congress could change the law to require businesses t pay for the birth control and abortion drugs.\n\n\u201cThere are other ways in which Congress or HHS could equally ensure that every woman has cost-free access to the particular contraceptives at issue here and, indeed, to all FDA-approved contraceptives,\u201d the opinion concluded.\n\n\u201cThe plain terms of RFRA make it perfectly clear that Congress did not discriminate in this way against men and women who wish to run their businesses as for-profit corporations in the manner required by their religious beliefs,\u201d read the opinion.\n\nChief Justice John Roberts, Justices Antonin Scalia, Clarence Thomas and Anthony Kennedy joined in the majority decision. Justices Stephen Breyer, Elena Kagan, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Sonia Sotomayor dissented.\n\nJustice Anthony Kennedy wrote a concurring opinion saying that government itself could provide the coverage for contraception and the abortion-causing drugs if a company declines to do so.\n\nBut, Americans oppose the HHS mandate and its pro-abortion requirements.\n\nA new Rasmussen Reports poll shows Americans agree with the Supreme Court\u2019s decision this week that the Christian-run Hobby Lobby doesn\u2019t have to obey the HHS mandate that is a part of Obamacare that requires businesses to pay for abortion causing drugs in their employee health care plans.\n\n\u201cHalf of voters agree with the U.S. Supreme Court that a business owner should be able to opt out of Obamacare\u2019s contraceptive mandate if it violates his or her religious beliefs,\u201d the poling firm reports about its new national survey.\n\nA December 2013 Rasmussen Reports poll shows Americans disagree with forcing companies like Hobby Lobby to obey the mandate.\n\nClick here to sign up for daily pro-life news alerts from LifeNews.com\n\n\u201cHalf of voters now oppose a government requirement that employers provide health insurance with free contraceptives for their female employees,\u201d Rasmussen reports.\n\nThe poll found: \u201cThe latest Rasmussen Reports national telephone survey finds that 38% of Likely U.S. Voters still believe businesses should be required by law to provide health insurance that covers all government-approved contraceptives for women without co-payments or other charges to the patient.\n\nFifty-one percent (51%) disagree and say employers should not be required to provide health insurance with this type of coverage. Eleven percent (11%) are not sure.\u201d\n\nAnother recent poll found 59 percent of Americans disagree with the mandate.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Democrats File Bill to Overturn Supreme Court Decision Protecting Hobby Lobby", "og": {"site_name": "LifeNews.com", "description": "As promised, Senate Democrats filed legislation today to \"overturn\" the Supreme Court's decision protecting Hobby Lobby and other companies from being forced to", "title": "Democrats File Bill to \u201cOverturn\u201d Supreme Court Decision Protecting Hobby Lobby", "url": "http://www.lifenews.com/2014/07/09/democrats-file-bill-to-overturn-supreme-court-decision-protecting-hobby-lobby/", "image": "http://www.lifenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/hobbylobby6-190x130.png", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 204509779594999}, "google-site-verification": "PPPx-GD0i7nWjUFAYnFdOYorAAJLuNyKOl23JCeXyrQ", "keywords": "democrats file bill to overturn supreme court decision protecting hobby lobby", "OBKey": "avejq02j7xRr+0owuq+Pcw==", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9e2e\"", "article_summary": "The Supreme Court ruled that the Christian-run Hobby Lobby doesn\u2019t have to obey the HHS mandate that is a part of Obamacare.\nFifty-one percent (51%) disagree and say employers should not be required to provide health insurance with this type of coverage.\nA December 2013 Rasmussen Reports poll shows Americans disagree with forcing companies like Hobby Lobby to obey the mandate.\nAs promised, Senate Democrats filed legislation today to \u201coverturn\u201d the Supreme Court\u2019s decision protecting Hobby Lobby and other companies from being forced to comply with the HHS mandate that compels them to pay for abortion-causing drugs for their employees.\nVoters still believe businesses should be required by law to provide health insurance that covers all government-approved contraceptives for women without co-payments or other charges to the patient."}
