House Armed Ser\u00advices Com\u00admit\u00adtee Chair\u00adman Buck McK\u00adeon, a co\u00adspon\u00adsor of the En\u00adlist Act, even\u00adtu\u00adally pledged to not in\u00adclude the pro\u00adpos\u00adal in the un\u00adder\u00adly\u00ading bill text, for fear that it would be\u00adcome a pois\u00adon pill.\n\nDen\u00adham turned his ef\u00adforts this month to get the bill through as an amend\u00adment on the de\u00adfense bill, which would have forced law\u00admakers to go on the re\u00adcord about the pro\u00adpos\u00adal. The of\u00adfice of Ma\u00adjor\u00adity Lead\u00ader Eric Can\u00adtor shot that down on Fri\u00adday. \u201cNo pro\u00adposed EN\u00adLIST amend\u00adments to NDAA will be made in or\u00adder,\u201d a Can\u00adtor spokes\u00adman had said in a state\u00adment.\n\nDen\u00adham said he was sur\u00adprised by that move. \u201cThe state\u00adment came from staff, so I\u2019m still look\u00ading for a reas\u00adon,\u201d he said.\n\nCan\u00adtor has pre\u00advi\u00adously echoed sup\u00adport for a path to cit\u00adizen\u00adship for dream\u00aders, but the \u201cKids Act\u201d that would do just that hasn\u2019t ma\u00adter\u00adi\u00adal\u00adized.\n\nDur\u00ading Tues\u00adday\u2019s Rules Com\u00admit\u00adtee hear\u00ading, Den\u00adham in\u00adsisted that the meas\u00adure was ger\u00admane to the de\u00adbate around NDAA as a change to mil\u00adit\u00adary code. He offered the bill as an amend\u00adment last year and it was ruled in or\u00adder then, but he ended up with\u00addraw\u00ading it when com\u00admit\u00adtee jur\u00adis\u00addic\u00adtion\u00adal is\u00adsues arose. He pledged not to with\u00addraw this time around.\n\n\u201cNot only is this an is\u00adsue of na\u00adtion\u00adal se\u00adcur\u00adity and mil\u00adit\u00adary read\u00adi\u00adness, but those kids who are here and have gone through our edu\u00adca\u00adtion sys\u00adtem, why wouldn\u2019t we let the De\u00adpart\u00adment of De\u00adfense to pick the best and bright\u00adest?\u201d Den\u00adham said. \u201cI be\u00adlieve in earned cit\u00adizen\u00adship, but there\u2019s no bet\u00adter way to show your pat\u00adri\u00adot\u00adism, your com\u00admit\u00adment, your sac\u00adri\u00adfice, and the will\u00ading\u00adness to earn your cit\u00adizen\u00adship than a will\u00ading\u00adness to serve in our mil\u00adit\u00adary.\u201d\n\nChan\u00adging im\u00admig\u00adra\u00adtion policy to be\u00adne\u00adfit dream\u00aders has be\u00adcome one of the few le\u00adgis\u00adlat\u00adive areas that in\u00adspires strong bi\u00adpar\u00adtis\u00adan sup\u00adport.
