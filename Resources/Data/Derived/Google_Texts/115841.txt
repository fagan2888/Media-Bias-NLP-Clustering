SOUTH RIVER — Gov. Chris Christie called Obamacare a "failed federal program" during a heated exchange with a health policy advocate during a town hall meeting in South River today.

Christie and Maura Collinsgru of New Jersey Citizen Action repeatedly spoke over one another as they went back and forth over healthcare in the state. At issue was the administration's efforts to connect residents to health insurance coverage.

The state did not submit a plan by deadline for spending $7.6 million in federal money to help explain the federal health insurance law to residents.

Collinsgru said that was one example of how the Christie administration is not connecting people to the coverage they need.

Christie batted down the criticism today, saying, "we've expanded Medicaid. We're the second most generous Medicaid program in the United States of America."

"That's true," Collinsgru said, "but the marketplace people need to connect. And that's almost 400,000 of them who qualify for subsidies. We need to help them connect."

"You believe that Obamacare works and I believe it does not," Christie told .Collinsgru.

Collisgru said insurers, hospital systems, advocates and even Christie's own Medicaid director all agree they must connect people to coverage. "We're asking you to join that," she said.

"Two weeks ago I met with my Medicaid director, she had no complaints," Christie said. "So I think that my access to my Medicaid director is significantly better than your opinion of it."
