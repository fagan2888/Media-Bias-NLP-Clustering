Today, though, I\u2019m going to break the stereotype by writing about the fascinating intersection of sex and public policy.\n\nOkay, maybe it\u2019s only the sex part that\u2019s interesting, but we\u2019re going to look at a couple of examples of how excessive government can take the fun out of anything.\n\nIn other words, we\u2019re going to add to our \u201csin tax\u201d collection.\n\nNow let\u2019s get to our new additions.\n\nHere are some of the details from a story in the U.K.-based Telegraph.\n\nA brothel in Austria is offering free sex to its customers \u2013 as a tax protest. Pascha brothel in the city of Salzburg is advertising a \u201cSummer Special\u201d. \u201cWe\u2019re not paying any more tax!\u201d says an announcement on the brothel\u2019s website. \u201cFrom now on: Free entry! Free drinks! Free sex!\u201d The brothel\u2019s owner, Hermann M\u00fcller, is paying the prostitutes out of his own pocket as a protest against what he says are unfair taxes.\n\nGee, this sounds a lot more intriguing than throwing tea in Boston Harbor.\n\nAnd a lot more popular.\n\n\u201c\u2026we\u2019ve already had to send hundreds of customers away because we had a full house,\u201d Mr M\u00fcller told Austria\u2019s Kronen Zeitung newspaper.\n\nThe brother owner doesn\u2019t like the fact that government seems to make more money off prostitution than he does.\n\nThe German-born Mr M\u00fcller runs a chain of brothels\u2026 \u201cIn the past decade alone I\u2019ve paid nearly \u20ac5m in taxes in Salzburg alone,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd they want more and more\u2026\u201d He complained that tax officials check up on the brothel\u2019s business every 14 days.\n\nMaybe Mr. should move to Nevada. That state, for unknown reasons (perhaps politicians are big customers?), has a loophole in the sales tax for prostitution services.\n\nAnd maybe the women also should move since Nevada doesn\u2019t have a state income tax.\n\nUnder Austrian law prostitutes must be self-employed \u2013 so they will still be liable for their own taxes.\n\nBy the way, we have similar issues in the United States.\n\nAs reported by the New York Law Journal, it seems government tax collectors like to insert themselves (no pun intended) between consenting adults.\n\nPole dance routines by exotic dancers in an Albany-area juice bar are an expression of artistic merit, but the private couch dances performed for individual patrons are not, a state tax department administrative law judge has ruled. The distinction drawn by ALJ Joseph Pinto Jr. is an important one for the outcome of the state Division of Taxation\u2019s latest attempt to collect sales taxes from the Nite Moves club on couch dances. Auditors contend that the club and its proprietors owe the state just under $530,000 in unpaid taxes on the private dances and on cover charges for the period.\n\nThe strip club wanted to take advantage of the sales tax exemption for art.\n\nThe same club challenged its tax bill for 2002-05, also on grounds it was due the exemption for artistic performances on First Amendment grounds.\n\nBut the Judge decided that pole dances qualify, but not lap dances.\n\nPinto rejected the claim of Nite Moves\u2019 owners that the couch dances, being artistic in nature, fall under the same state sales tax exemption\u2026 He cited the testimony presented by several dance experts about the artistic merit of the pole routines.\n\nThe Judge\u2019s decision seems to track the outcome of a similar case involving the Hustler Club in New York City, so government officials in the Empire State are obviously on top (no pun intended) of these issues.\n\nAnd even though bureaucrats have a reputation for being lazy, some of them are willing to go above and beyond the call of duty to make sure the tax laws are enforced.\n\nHe cited the testimony of the supervisor of the Nite Moves audit who said the \u201cprivate dance was essentially a full body rub\u201d and far different than the pole dances the supervisor observed in his 10 to 15 visits to the club.\n\nHmmm\u2026, I wonder whether \u201cthe supervisor\u201d has a wife and whether she thought 10 to 15 visits were really necessary?\n\nLet\u2019s close by making a serious point. Prostitutes and \u201cexotic dancers\u201d presumably don\u2019t have easy lives. And maybe we should even have some sympathy for their customers, who presumably would prefer not to have to pay women for their company.\n\nSo why, then, impose extra-high taxes on the sex industry?\n\nThough maybe we should look at the bright side. At least hookers and strippers aren\u2019t savers and investors.\n\nThose are the people who get hit hardest by the tax system, though I\u2019ve never understood why financing tomorrow\u2019s growth is a sinful activity that should be discouraged.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Daniel Mitchell articles, Daniel J.
