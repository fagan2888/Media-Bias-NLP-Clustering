The 2015 Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections (CROI) takes place next week in Seattle, Washington, and AIDS.gov will be there. This annual scientific meeting of the world’s leading researchers working to understand, prevent, and treat HIV/AIDS, hepatitis C (HCV), Ebola, and related infectious diseases provides a vital forum for translating laboratory and clinical research into progress against these diseases. Several thousand HIV/AIDS and infectious disease research leaders from dozens of countries will assemble to share the latest studies, important developments, and research methods.

To learn more about the always-evolving science related to HIV/AIDS and HCV, AIDS.gov is attending CROI. As we’ve done in the past, we’ll share highlights from the conference here on the blog next week and the week following. This will include video interviews by Dr. Ronald Valdiserri of HHS as well as science highlights from NIH’s Dr. Carl Dieffenbach.

We encourage you to learn more about CROI. View the program-at-a-glance. You can also access webcasts, abstracts, electronic posters, and other resources available online at the conference website (www.CROIconference.org ). And be sure to follow the conference via social media at #CROI2015.
