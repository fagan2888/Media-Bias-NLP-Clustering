Marco Rubio said that \u201cwelders make more money than philosophers.\u201d Actually, those with undergraduate degrees in philosophy earn a higher median income than welders.\n\nBusinessman Donald Trump said that President Dwight D. Eisenhower had forced out 1.5 million immigrants who were in the country illegally. The federal government claimed it was 1.3 million, but historians say that\u2019s exaggerated.\n\nTexas Sen. Ted Cruz said the Tax Foundation calculated that his tax plan \u201ccosts less than virtually every other plan people have put up here, and yet it produces more growth.\u201d But the foundation said Bobby Jindal\u2019s and Rubio\u2019s plans both would lead to higher gross domestic product growth over a decade.\n\nCruz also repeated the years-long falsehood that there\u2019s a \u201ccongressional exemption\u201d from Obamacare. Members of Congress and their staffs face additional requirements than other Americans, not fewer.\n\nLouisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal said that his state has had \u201ceight credit upgrades,\u201d but two credit rating agencies moved the state to a \u201cnegative\u201d outlook in February. And it faces a $117 million deficit in its most recent budget.\n\nFormer Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee said he had cut his state budget by 11 percent during the 2001-2003 recession. Over his entire tenure, however, spending went up by 50 percent.\n\nJindal claimed that there were \u201cmore people working in Louisiana than ever before.\u201d That\u2019s wrong. There were fewer Louisianans working in September than there were in December 2014.\n\nHuckabee said that Syrians make up only 20 percent of the refugees arriving in Europe. The figure is actually 52 percent for 2015.\n\nAnalysis\n\nIn the Fox Business Network debate held Nov. 10 in Milwaukee, only eight candidates took to the main stage \u2014 Donald Trump, Dr. Ben Carson, Sen. Marco Rubio, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina, Sen. Ted Cruz, Ohio Gov. John Kasich and Sen. Rand Paul.\n\nFour more Republicans debated earlier that evening: New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, former U.S. Sen. Rick Santorum and Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal.\n\nPhilosophers Better Paid Than Welders\n\nRubio proposed increasing vocational education opportunities for high school students, but he went too far when he said that \u201cwelders make more money than philosophers.\u201d Typically, they do not.\n\nRubio: For the life of me, I don\u2019t know why we have stigmatized vocational education. Welders make more money than philosophers. We need more welders and less philosophers.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal, a cohost of the debate, published a chart on undergraduate degrees that \u201cpay you back,\u201d and prominently mentioned philosophy majors.\n\nThe Journal wrote, \u201cYour parents might have worried when you chose Philosophy or International Relations as a major. But a year-long survey of 1.2 million people with only a bachelor\u2019s degree by PayScale Inc. shows that graduates in these subjects earned 103.5% and 97.8% more, respectively, about 10 years post-commencement\u201d than they had earned right out of college.\n\nPayScale\u2019s latest data, for 2015-16, show that the median starting salary for a worker holding a philosophy degree is $42,200, rising to $85,000 after 10 years. By contrast, the median income for a welder with zero to 5 years experience is $38,728, increasing to $44,498 after 10 years, according to PayScale.\n\nSimilarly, the Bureau of Labor Statistics says the median annual wage was $63,630 for a philosophy and religion teacher as of May 2014, and $36,300 for welders, cutters, solderers and brazers as of 2012.\n\nTrump Invokes \u2018Operation Wetback\u2019\n\nTrump, defending his promise to deport millions of immigrants in the country illegally, cited the actions of President Dwight D. Eisenhower:\n\nTrump: Let me just tell you that Dwight Eisenhower, good president, great president. \u2026 Moved a 1.5 million illegal immigrants out of this country. \u2026 You don\u2019t get nicer. You don\u2019t get friendlier. They moved a 1.5 million out. We have no choice. We have no choice.\n\nIt\u2019s true that during a 1954 effort that was officially known as \u201cOperation Wetback\u201d (a term that many today find offensive), the federal government claimed to have forced as many as 1.3 million people to return to Mexico, but historians consider that number to be exaggerated.\n\nTexas State Historical Association: It is difficult to estimate the number of people forced to leave by the operation. The INS [Immigration and Naturalization Service] claimed as many as 1,300,000, though the number officially apprehended did not come anywhere near this total. The INS estimate rested on the claim that most undocumented immigrants, fearing apprehension by the government, had voluntarily repatriated themselves before and during the operation.\n\nTrump also claimed that those forced to return \u201cnever came back\u201d after being moved \u201cway down south\u201d rather than just across the border. According to historian Mae M. Ngai, in her book \u201cImpossible Subjects: Illegal Aliens and the Making of Modern America,\u201d many of those deported were simply transported a few miles across the border and left in the desert, but more than 25 percent were transported to the Mexican coastal city of Veracruz on hired cargo ships. A congressional investigation later likened one of the ships to \u201can eighteenth century slave ship,\u201d Ngai wrote.\n\nWorth noting is that after the operation was concluded, border officials declared that \u201c[t]he so-called \u2018wetback\u2019 problem no longer exists,\u201d and that \u201c[t]he border has been secured.\u201d That, of course, turned out to be wishful thinking.\n\nCruz\u2019s Tax Plan Boast\n\nCruz said that according to the Tax Foundation, his tax plan \u201ccosts less than virtually every other plan people have put up here, and yet it produces more growth.\u201d\n\nActually, among the tax plans of seven Republican candidates that it analyzed, the Tax Foundation concluded that the gross domestic product would grow more over the next decade under two other plans \u2014 from Bobby Jindal and Marco Rubio. The Tax Foundation also concluded that Rubio\u2019s plan would lead to higher wage and capital investment growth.\n\nCruz\u2019s tax plan calls for a 10 percent flat tax on individual income, though for a family of four, the first $36,000 would be tax-free. On the business end, the corporate income tax and payroll taxes would be eliminated and replaced with a \u201cbusiness flat tax\u201d of 16 percent.\n\nCruz correctly noted that the Tax Foundation concluded that under a \u201cstatic\u201d basis, the plan would reduce revenues by $3.6 trillion over 10 years. But under \u201cdynamic\u201d scoring \u2014 accounting for the economic growth the Tax Foundation expects his plan would spur \u2014 it estimates the plan would only reduce revenues by about $768 billion. That means it is estimated to cost less than every other Republican plan analyzed by the Tax Foundation, except for Rand Paul\u2019s (which it estimates would increase revenues by $737 billion).\n\nBut Cruz was wrong to say the Tax Foundation found his plan produces the most growth.\n\nAccording to the Tax Foundation, Cruz\u2019s plan would grow the GDP by 13.9 percent over the next 10 years. But the Tax Foundation concluded that Jindal\u2019s plan would grow the GDP by 14.4 percent, and Rubio\u2019s plan would grow the GDP by 15 percent.\n\nThe Tax Foundation also found that Cruz\u2019s tax plan would lead to 10-year capital investment growth of 43.9 percent, and to 10-year wage rate growth of 12.2 percent. That\u2019s lower than the projected growth from Rubio\u2019s plan of 48.9 percent for capital investment and 12.5 percent for the wage rate.\n\nCruz Repeats \u2018Exempt\u2019 Whopper\n\nCruz repeated the long-running myth that Congress is \u201cexempt\u201d from Obamacare. Lawmakers and their staffs actually face additional requirements that other Americans don\u2019t, thanks to a Republican amendment.\n\nCruz: And, I\u2019ll give you an example of that, which is the Congressional exemption from Obamacare, which is fundamentally wrong, and I\u2019ll tell you this, if I\u2019m elected president, I will veto any statute that exempts members of congress. The law should apply evenly to every American.\n\nUnlike other Americans who get their insurance through their employers, members of Congress are now barred from directly doing so. As of 2014, they can no longer get health coverage through the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program, as they and other federal employees have done for years. Because of a Republican amendment added to the law, members are required to get their insurance through the Affordable Care Act\u2019s insurance marketplaces.\n\nBefore that amendment, the legislation said that federal employees, employees of large companies, and those who get insurance through Medicare or Medicaid wouldn\u2019t be eligible for the marketplaces, which were designed for individuals buying their own insurance. That gave rise to the false notion that Congress was somehow \u201cexempt\u201d from the law. But lawmakers were being treated just like other workers with employer-provided insurance. And they were required to have insurance or face a penalty, just like everyone else.\n\nBut even after the amendment put Congress in the ACA marketplaces, the \u201cexempt\u201d claim lived on.\n\nThe federal government had long made premium contributions to pay for part of federal employees\u2019 health insurance, including the insurance of members of Congress and their staffs \u2014 just like other employers do. And in August 2013, the Office of Personnel Management, which administers the FEHB Program, said that the federal government could continue to make those premium contributions for Congress, even though members were getting insurance through the marketplaces. OPM said the contribution couldn\u2019t be greater than what\u2019s made under the FEHB Program. Republicans claimed, once again, that this made Congress \u201cexempt\u201d from the law \u2014 even though lawmakers were getting the same employer contributions they got before, but faced the requirement of getting new coverage through the marketplaces.\n\nLouisiana\u2019s Finances Not So Rosy\n\nJindal painted a rosy picture of his state\u2019s fiscal situation. Attacking New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, he said: \u201cIn New Jersey, you\u2019ve had nine credit downgrades, setting a record. We\u2019ve had eight credit upgrades in Louisiana.\u201d\n\nJindal is right about New Jersey. But Louisiana\u2019s finances are not as good as the governor suggests. According to the New Orleans Times-Picayune, two credit rating agencies \u2014 Moody\u2019s and Standard & Poor\u2019s \u2014 moved Louisiana from a \u201cstable\u201d to a \u201cnegative\u201d outlook in February. \u201cBoth agencies held off on downgrading the state\u2019s credit rating at this time, but a \u2018negative\u2019 outlook does leave the state vulnerable to a future drop,\u201d the newspaper reported.\n\nMore recently, the Associated Press reported that the state ended its most recent budget year with a $117 million deficit, which by law must be made up before the next budget year begins. \u201cLouisiana has faced repeated budget shortfalls during Jindal\u2019s two terms in office, a combination of the economic downturn and the cost of tax breaks that have siphoned more dollars away from the state treasury than expected,\u201d the AP reported. \u201cRather than match state spending to income, the governor and lawmakers have raided savings accounts, sold property and used other short-term fixes to patch together budgets. But that creates new gaps each year.\u201d\n\nHuckabee on Cutting Arkansas Budget\n\nHuckabee repeated a claim he made during the 2008 presidential campaign, saying that when he was governor of Arkansas \u201cwe ended up cutting 11 percent out of the state budget through that [2001-2003] recession.\u201d Jindal countered that \u201cspending in Arkansas went up 65 percent\u201d under Huckabee.\n\nHuckabee cherry-picks from his two terms to make his claim. Jindal is close, but doesn\u2019t adjust for inflation. Spending in Arkansas went up by 50 percent in inflation-adjusted dollars over Huckabee\u2019s time overseeing the state budget.\n\nWe checked Huckabee\u2019s 11 percent claim before \u2014 way back in January 2008 in a Republican presidential debate. The head of the Arkansas Budget Office told us it was \u201ccertainly plausible\u201d that the cuts amounted to 11 percent of the budget in fiscal 2002 \u2014 a year for which a glitch in the state record-keeping system made accessing data difficult.\n\nBut the better measure of Huckabee\u2019s record is his entire time in office. In inflation-adjusted dollars, spending went from $10.4 billion in fiscal year 1998, the first budget under Huckabee\u2019s responsibility, to $15.6 billion by the end of 2006.\n\nJindal accurately cited a figure from a Cato Institute commentary piece. But using inflation-adjusted figures, the increase was less than 65 percent.\n\nJindal on Job Growth\n\nJindal said that \u201cas we sit here today, we have more people working in Louisiana than ever before\u201d and that \u201cwe\u2019ve had 60 months in a row of consecutive job growth in our state.\u201d That\u2019s not accurate.\n\nIn fact, there were fewer people working in Louisiana in September than there were in December 2014, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. And while there has been a fairly steady increase in employment since the end of the recession, there have been several months with dips.\n\nTrish Regan, a moderator of the Fox Business debate, noted that as governor, Jindal has \u201cpushed Louisiana\u2019s energy resources as a means to grow jobs in your state\u201d but that \u201cas oil prices have plunged in recent months, so has jobs growth.\u201d\n\nRegan correctly stated that Louisiana now has an unemployment rate, 6 percent, above the national average, even though in February 2014 the Louisiana rate (5.4 percent) was more than a percentage point below the national average (6.7 percent). So, she asked, \u201cWill your energy-focused jobs plan for the country be subject to the same market ups and downs?\u201d\n\nJindal responded, \u201cIn Louisiana, we\u2019re actually a top 10 state for job growth. As we sit here today, we have more people working in Louisiana than ever before, earning a higher income than ever before. We\u2019ve had 60 months in a row of consecutive job growth in our state. So the reality is, we have diversified our economy.\u201d\n\nAccording to the latest available employment data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, there were 1,990,000 people employed in Louisiana in September. That\u2019s 6,600 fewer jobs than in December 2014, so it is incorrect for Jindal to say, \u201cAs we sit here today, we have more people working in Louisiana than ever before.\u201d There has been a dip, and some energy industry experts have attributed that to a drop in oil prices.\n\nIn addition, the unemployment rate in Louisiana was at 6 percent in August and September. As Regan said, that\u2019s higher than the national average, which was 5.1 percent in September. The state\u2019s unemployment rate was below the current rate of 6 percent from November 2013 through May 2014.\n\nWe\u2019re not sure which 60 months Jindal was referring to when he boasted that Louisiana has had \u201c60 months in a row of consecutive job growth.\u201d But that\u2019s not true of any 60-month period during Jindal\u2019s tenure as governor, which began in January 2008. Although there has been fairly steady job growth in Louisiana since the end of the recession, there have been several setback months interspersed along the way.\n\nAs for Louisiana being a top 10 state for job growth, we reached out to the Jindal campaign to see what time period that referenced, and we did not hear back. But looking at the entirety of Jindal\u2019s tenure as Louisiana governor, the rate of job growth, 2.9 percent, slightly lagged the national growth rate of 3.1 percent over the same period.\n\nHuckabee Understates Syrian Refugees\n\nHuckabee said that Syrians make up only 20 percent of the refugees arriving in Europe. That\u2019s wrong.\n\nHuckabee: The idea that we\u2019re just going to open our doors, and we have no idea who these people are \u2014 what we do know is that only 1 out of 5 of the so called \u201cSyrian Refugees,\u201d who went into Europe were actually Syrian. Many of them, we had no idea who they were. They weren\u2019t Syrian.\n\nAccording to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, Syrians made up 52 percent of the more than 792,000 refugees who crossed the Mediterranean sea into Europe in 2015.\n\nIn September, the Daily Mail, a British tabloid, reported that 4 out of 5 of the refugees arriving in Europe weren\u2019t from Syria. But that analysis only looked at the 213,000 refugees arriving in April, May and June of this year. That\u2019s about one-fourth of the total number of refugee arrivals in 2015.\n\n\u2014 by Eugene Kiely, Brooks Jackson, Lori Robertson, Robert Farley and D\u2019Angelo Gore\n\nCorrection, Nov. 11: We incorrectly referred to the Fox Business Network as Fox Business News.
