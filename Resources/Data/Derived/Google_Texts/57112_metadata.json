Since 2012, the group \u2013 which is headed by a former aide to Kathleen Sebelius \u2013 has become increasingly strident in its opposition to pro-life concerns about ObamaCare and the Catholic bishops' attempts to protect religious freedom and uphold traditional sexual teachings.\n\n\"For years, Catholics United abused the name 'Catholic' to divide us and spread confusion about what our faith teaches,\u201d Thomas Peters, author of the American Papist blog, told LifeSiteNews. \u201cNow we find out the members of this organization were knowingly engaged in a deception by which they spent the money of a man who publicly opposes the Catholic Church to secretly carry out his agenda.\u201d\n\nBill Donohue, president of the Catholic League, told LifeSiteNews, \u201cCatholics United is not an organization, per se: it is a letterhead outfit funded by those who hate the Catholic Church.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt exists for one reason: to create in the mind of the public that it is O.K. to reject the Church\u2019s teachings on sexuality and still be a good Catholic,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is nothing Catholic about it.\u201d\n\nAlways left-of-center, Catholics United spent $500,000 to defend the seats of Democratic congressmen who voted for ObamaCare but who were said to be otherwise \u201cpro-life.\u201d The group's then-executive director, Chris Korzen \u2013 a former organizer for the Service Employees International Union (SEIU) \u2013 said he was \u201cfrustrated by the dishonesty of many political operatives who oppose reform of our nation's outdated economic and social policies.\u201d\n\nCurrent executive director James Salt led a small contingent of protesters against Archbishop William Lori's Fortnight of Freedom event in 2012, which was organized to oppose various threats to religious freedom, including the HHS mandate that all employers must furnish their female employees with contraception, sterilization, and abortifacient drugs with no co-pay. Standing outside the Basilica of the Assumption in Baltimore, the small group held signs saying, \u201cBishops! You don't speak for me! Freedom for all!\u201d\n\nAccording to his online biography, Salt \u201coversaw the Kansas Democratic Party's faith outreach efforts, including messaging work for Governor [Kathleen] Sebelius,\u201d later the secretary of Health and Human Services overseeing the implementation of the mandate.\n\nSalt was also \u201cpart of the launch team of Catholics in Alliance for the Common Good,\u201d another dissenting group. His co-founder, Alexia Kelley, served as director of the HHS department's Faith-Based and Neighborhood Partnerships under Sebelius.\n\nTogether, Salt and Catholics United dismissed the USCCB's concerns that, by forcing Catholic businesses to violate their faith, the mandate violated the Constitution's first freedom. Chris Pumpelly, communications director for Catholics United, said in 2012 that \u201ceverybody knows\u201d when bishops raise concerns about religious liberty that \u201cit is code for \u2018Vote Republican.'\u201d\n\nBy 2012, Catholics United began to focus on homosexuality.\n\nThat year the group accused the Knights of Columbus of engaging in \u201cdivisive culture wars\u201d by supporting measures to protect marriage around the country from judicial activism.\n\nIn the last year, Catholics United blasted Catholic bishops for allowing schools to fire homosexual teachers at Catholic schools who got \u201cmarried\u201d to members of the same sex, saying the teachers' \u201conly transgression was a desire to live with the same dignity afforded everyone else.\u201d Catholic schools have since faced lawsuits for insisting its teachers abide by Catholic teachings in their public witness.\n\nWhen Fr. Derek Lappe canceled his Seattle-area church's affiliation with the Boy Scouts over its new policy welcoming homosexual boys to join, Salt replied, \u201cFr. Lappe is saying your child is fundamentally \u2018disordered.'\u201d Catholics United has since intimated that there is no basis for opposition to homosexuality in the Gospels.\n\nHowever, the Catechism of the Catholic Church states that the Bible \u201cpresents homosexual acts as acts of grave depravity\u201d and that \u201chomosexual acts are intrinsically disordered.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey are contrary to the natural law,\u201d the Catechism, the Catholic Church's official compendium of theological and moral doctrines, continues. \u201cThey do not proceed from a genuine affective and sexual complementarity. Under no circumstances can they be approved.\u201d\n\nClick \"like\" to support Catholics Restoring the Culture!\n\nJennifer Kraska, the executive director of the Colorado Catholic Conference, told CNA, \u201cit is very obvious that Mr. Gill does not agree with the Catholic Church and Her teachings on the issues of homosexuality and marriage.\u201d\n\nCritics accuse Gill and other mega-donors of trying to undermine religious denominations critical of homosexuality from the inside. For instance, the Gill Foundation\u2019s 2006 annual report revealed that it had funded a study that \u201cdetailed work underway in denominations, seminaries, clergy coalitions and media to counter religious opposition\u201d to homosexuality.\n\nJohn Lomperis with the Institute for Religion and Democracy told CNA that Gill, the Arcus Foundation, and other tax-exempt foundations had undertaken \u201cmajor, concerted efforts to engineer \u2018hostile takeovers\u2019 of American religious communities for their agenda.\u201d\n\nPart of that involves sidelining representatives of the Church's true teachings, Bill Donohue told LifeSiteNews. Catholics United \u201ctried to get me kicked off CNN and orchestrated an IRS hit on me in 2008,\u201d Donohue said. \u201cBoth attempts failed miserably.\u201d\n\nSo did Catholics United's attempt to launch its own news agency in 2012. However, its statements receive wide distribution, which Donohue and Peters say confuses their readers.\n\n\u201cCatholics can best avoid being tricked by these underhanded tactics in the future if we follow the age-old teachings of the church and listen carefully to what our priests and bishops are saying about the issues of the day,\" Peters told LifeSiteNews.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "LifeSiteNews", "title": "Dissenting \u2018Catholics United\u2019 group funded by homosexual multimillionaire", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/lifesite/Miscellaneous/Catholics_United.png", "url": "https://www.lifesitenews.com/news/dissenting-catholics-united-group-funded-by-homosexual-multimillionaire", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 1477213784, "app_id": 132010293551131, "pages": 112623813202}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf37f\"", "article_summary": "Catholics United \u201ctried to get me kicked off CNN and orchestrated an IRS hit on me in 2008,\u201d Donohue said.\nNewsCatholic ChurchWASHINGTON, D.C. \u2013 The dissenting religious group Catholics United has received the lion's share of its funding from a homosexual multimillionaire, seemingly driving its growing denunciations of the Catholic hierarchy and the pro-life/pro-family movement.\n'\u201d Catholics United has since intimated that there is no basis for opposition to homosexuality in the Gospels.\n'\u201dBy 2012, Catholics United began to focus on homosexuality.\nSalt was also \u201cpart of the launch team of Catholics in Alliance for the Common Good,\u201d another dissenting group."}
