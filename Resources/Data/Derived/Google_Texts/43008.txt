VITA at Virginia Law

University of Virginia law students are volunteering their time to prepare taxes for low to moderate income families for free.

The service is open to the entire local community.

"you see people come in and you're helping them with an issue that they have that otherwise they'd have to go spend $200 or $300," said Cole Malmberg, a third-year UVa Law student.

This is Malmberg's eighth year preparing taxes, he says this year is slightly different from the years before thanks to the Affordable Care Act.

"There's just a whole different component there and they tried to make it as simple as possible as far as I can tell with ObamaCare, but it's still hard to calculate. Do you want to provide exemptions for people with lower incomes from having to pay this and so it gets complicated," said Malmberg.

The added layer to this year's tax preparation process means staying up on all of the changes and new laws.

"We get a pro-bono credit for doing this, so for some law students that's just getting some experience, helping out on law related issues for others and it can help meet a bar requirement," said Malmberg.

It is a win-win, as law students can give back to the community and gain hands on experience at the same time.

"You're dealing with actual people which is so nice in law school sometimes you're just you're delving into case books and things and just sitting there reading by yourself all the time and this is so different than that," he said.

VITA at Virginia Law is offering services up until the filing deadline on April 15.
