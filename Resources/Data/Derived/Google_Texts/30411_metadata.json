This latest attempt to strip the organization of federal funds comes in the wake of the release of investigative videos by the Center for Medical Progress. The latest video, released Thursday, purports to show \"Planned Parenthood of the Rocky Mountains\u2019 Vice President and Medical Director, Dr. Savita Ginde, negotiating a fetal body parts deal, agreeing multiple times to illicit pricing per body part harvested, and suggesting ways to avoid legal consequences.\"\n\nReaction to the video, even by progressives, has ranged from \"disturbing\" to \"stomach-churning.\" Despite finding the footage \"disturbing,\" Presidential candidate Hillary Clinton continued her overall support for the organization. In an op-ed for the Washington Post, Ruth Marcus argues even though the callousness shown by the PP officials is \"stomach-churning,\" defunding the organization would be illogical since it would \"increase abortions.\" The argument is the decrease in access to contraceptives would lead to an increase in unwanted pregnancies, and thus abortions. More on this later.\n\nThe Center for Medical Progress videos prompted Governor Mike Pence to order an investigation into the handling of body parts by Planned Parenthood clinics in Indiana. According to the local FOX affiliate website. the investigation found the Indiana clinics handle fetal tissue in compliance with state regulations.\"\n\nMany of those who identify themselves as Pro-Life do so based on their belief in the biblical concept that all humans are made in the image of God\u2014including the unborn. The sacredness of life is vital to their understanding of how to live. On the other hand, many Pro-Choice advocates say their view actually respects life more. This brief article will not solve the issue of how you should think. But there are some things worth considering no matter which side of the issue you are on.\n\nSenator Joe Donnelly is self-described as Pro-Life, but he has long straddled the fence on the issue, and has been criticized from both sides. He and other \"moderates\" are facing pressure. Planned Parenthood recently ran an ad (See the embedded video above.) designed to persuade Donnelly to vote against the defunding Senate bill scheduled for a vote Monday. The woman in the video claims PP saved her life because of the cancer screening they provide.\n\nPlanned Parenthood facilities do not, as some politicians have asserted, provide mammograms, but they do provide some other screenings and refer their patients to third-party providers. During the 2012 presidential campaign, an article in The Washington Post criticized President Obama for continually stating the organization provided mammograms, giving him Three Pinocchios.\n\n[Obama] has repeatedly suggested that the organization provides mammograms directly, indicating more than a slip-up. This claim seems to have become an intentional part of the incumbent\u2019s talking points.\n\nThe president has also failed to mention in all his Planned Parenthood remarks that the Affordable Care Act is designed to bring more people onto Medicaid rolls, which would give those additional beneficiaries access to mammograms. Additionally, the health-care law requires employers to provide coverage for those exams with no out-of-pocket costs for the insured \u2014 it\u2019s part of the mandated preventive health-care services.\n\nAt the end of the day, women overall should be able to rely less on Planned Parenthood for mammograms with the Affordable Care Act in place.\n\nWhile it is true the immediate defunding of PP could cause some disruptions to important services for those who are unable to find an alternative immediately, there are other choices, most of which do not provide abortions. How about funding those groups, Joe? At the very least, Planned Parenthood needs to be investigated by the Federal government, and people prosecuted if they have violated the law.", "article_metadata": {"description": "As the debate rages over Planned Parenthood, Pro-Life Indiana Democratic Senator Joe Donnelly faces a tough choice.
