They proactively work to undermine existing legal protections and promote anti-LGBT discrimination.\u201d\n\nReleased in advance of the HRC Scorecard for the 113th Congress, HRC identified these elected officials as the most anti-equality members of Congress by looking at their voting records in this and previous Congresses, their introduction and co-sponsorships of anti-LGBT legislation, and their public statements. While there are other anti-LGBT members of Congress, these elected officials\u2019 legislative actions, votes and anti-LGBT vitriol unfortunately marks them with a modern day scarlet letter.\n\nThe inductees into the inaugural class of HRC\u2019s Hall of Shame are:\n\nHouse (14):\n\nMichele Bachmann (R-MN)\n\nLouie Gohmert (R-TX)\n\nAndy Harris (R-MD)\n\nTim Huelskamp (R-KS)\n\nJim Jordan (R-OH)\n\nWalter Jones (R-NC)\n\nMike Kelly (R- PA)\n\nSteve King (R-IA)\n\nDoug LaMalfa (R-CA)\n\nMike McIntyre (D-NC)\n\nRandy Neugebauer (R-TX)\n\nSteve Pearce (R-NM)\n\nTim Walberg (R-MI)\n\nRandy Weber (R-TX)\n\nSenate (5):\n\nTed Cruz (R-TX)\n\nMichael Enzi (R-WY)\n\nJames Inhofe (R-OK)\n\nMike Lee (R-UT)\n\nJeff Sessions (R-AL)\n\nEach of these officials is a sponsor or cosponsor of some or all of the most anti-LGBT legislation that, if passed, would enshrine discrimination into our nation\u2019s body of laws and our Constitution. In the U.S. House of Representatives, this includes the Federal Marriage Amendment, the Child Welfare Provider Inclusion Act, the Marriage and Religious Freedom Act, the Military Religious Freedom Protection Act, and the State Marriage Defense Act. In the U.S. Senate, this includes the Child Welfare Provider Inclusion Act, the Marriage and Religious Freedom Act, and the State Marriage Defense Act.\n\nHouse (14):\n\nMichele Bachmann (R-MN) \u2014 Retiring from Congress this year, Bachmann made sure her final term in Congress was just as bad as all of the rest. Who can forget how she expressed her love for her step-sister: \u201cAny of you who have members of your family in the lifestyle, we have a member of our family that is [lesbian]. This is not funny. It\u2019s a very sad life. It\u2019s part of Satan, I think, to say that this is gay.\u201d\n\nLouie Gohmert (R-TX)\u2014 Gohmert always has a bad thing to say about LGBT people. Not content to falsely blame gay men for pedophilia or state with certainty that same-sex marriage will lead to bestiality, his whopper this Congress was to compare LGBT advocates to Nazis.\n\nAndy Harris (R-MD)\u2014 Harris defeated pro-LGBT Republican Congressman Wayne Gilchrest in a 2008 primary and then went on to lose the general election. Since he finally made it to Congress in 2010, Harris has gone out of his way to sponsor nearly every anti-LGBT bill introduced in the House.\n\nTim Huelskamp (R-KS)\u2014 Huelskamp rarely misses an opportunity to promote an anti-LGBT agenda. In the 113th Congress, he introduced both the Federal Marriage Amendment and the Military Religious Freedom Protection Act. Just last month, he was a ringleader in opposing an amendment for equal benefits for our nation\u2019s same-sex married veterans.\n\nJim Jordan (R-OH)\u2014 Jordan led the fight to try to block the District of Columbia from recognizing same-sex marriages. As a leader of the Republican Study Committee (RSC), he\u2019s made sure anti-LGBT issues remain on the RSC\u2019s agenda.\n\nWalter Jones (R-NC)\u2014 Jones is not new to anti-LGBT crusading. A decade ago, he was known for carrying a copy of the book King and King around to emphasize his opposition to kids even hearing about gay relationships. From \u201cDon\u2019t Ask, Don\u2019t Tell\u201d repeal to same-sex marriage, Jones opposes LGBT equality every step of the way.\n\nMike Kelly (R- PA)\u2014 At first glance, Kelly appears to be a more moderate, reasonable kind of guy. Yet in the 113th Congress, in addition to cosponsoring anti-LGBT bills, he took the initiative to introduce one of the must hurtful and harmful anti-LGBT bills yet\u2014the Child Welfare Provider Inclusion Act. This bill would allow adoption and foster care providers to use their personal religious beliefs as a reason to discriminate against LGBT people seeking to provide a loving home to a child in need.\n\nSteve King (R-IA)\u2014 During consideration of the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act, King claimed then-Rep. Tammy Baldwin (D-WI) had an agenda of protecting pedophiles. He ridiculously claimed that sexual orientation \u201ccould include exhibitionism. It can include necrophilia. It could include ... voyeurism. You see somebody spying on you changing clothes and you hit them, they've [sic] committed a misdemeanor.\u201d\n\nDoug LaMalfa (R-CA) \u2014 New to Congress in 2013, LaMalfa is singing from the anti-LGBT hymnal. He told National Journal: \u201cIf you open the floodgates to other ideas [about marriage], other concepts, you don\u2019t know where it ends. Multiple marriages, same-sex marriage, there\u2019s so many things that are not what the institution is supposed to be about. Indeed, an institution created by God and supposed to be held up and respected by men.\u201d And he loves co-sponsoring anti-LGBT legislation.\n\nMike McIntyre (D-NC)\u2014 Most House Democrats are strongly pro-LGBT, which means McIntyre stands out even more starkly as the most anti-LGBT Democrat. He is one of only two Democrats to cosponsor the Federal Marriage Amendment. If there is a pro-equality vote opportunity, McIntyre can usually be counted on to vote no.\n\nRandy Neugebauer (R-TX) \u2014 Neugebauer\u2019s claim to fame is yelling \u201cbaby killer\u201d on the House floor during the debate on the Affordable Care Act. However, he also works to keep his far right supporters happy by cosponsoring all five of the most anti-LGBT bills introduced during the 113th Congress.\n\nSteve Pearce (R-NM)\u2014 Pearce has been quick to sponsor anti-LGBT legislation. When a state judge found New Mexico\u2019s marriage ban to be unconstitutional, he told The Hill: \u201cThe reckless actions of this judge acting on personal opinion and ignoring legislative procedure threatens serious confusion, frustration, and pain for those who are being led to believe that the law has changed.\"\n\nTim Walberg (R-MI)\u2014 The former Bible salesman is quick with over the top rhetoric. He told a Family Research Council conference that Americans are \u201cslaves\u201d to \u201csexual perversion.\u201d If you have an anti-LGBT bill that you want cosponsored, Walberg is an easy supporter to get.\n\nRandy Weber (R-TX) \u2014 Weber wants to ensure that same-sex married couples who live in his home state of Texas, and the many other states without marriage equality, are denied any federal recognition or benefits. To try to achieve that end, he introduced the State Marriage Defense Act to stop federal agencies from recognizing these legal marriages.\n\nSenate (5):\n\nTed Cruz (R-TX)\u2014 Cruz likes to stand out in a crowd. As the author of the federal \u201cState Marriage Defense Act\u201d introduced in February, he collaborated with his Texas colleague Rep. Randy Weber to make sure his same-sex married constituents would have no federal protections. He is actively working to prevent marriage equality from becoming a reality for all Americans. Following the Supreme Court\u2019s action on Monday to reject the appeals requests of five states with same-sex marriage bans ruled unconstitutional by lower courts, Senator Cruz announced he will introduce a constitutional amendment barring the federal government and the courts from overturning state marriage laws.\n\nMichael Enzi (R-WY)\u2014 Enzi was able to avoid a primary challenge from Liz Cheney by arguing she was too pro-LGBT. To prove the point, he introduced the Child Welfare Provider Inclusion Act\u2014a bill that would allow adoption and foster care providers to use their personal religious beliefs as a reason to discriminate against LGBT people seeking to provide a loving home to a child in need.\n\nJames Inhofe (R-OK)\u2014 Don\u2019t expect evolution from Inhofe. He has proudly boasted that \u201cin the recorded history of our family, we\u2019ve never had a divorce or any kind of homosexual relationship.\u201d And he said he wouldn\u2019t hire any LGBT staffers.\n\nMike Lee (R-UT)\u2014 Not content to vote against the Employment Non-Discrimination Act, Lee also believes equal protection does not apply to LGBT people. To top it off, he was the author of the Marriage and Religious Freedom Act.\n\nJeff Sessions (R-AL)\u2014 A glimmer of enlightenment was on the horizon when Sessions said in 2009 that he might be able to support a nominee with \u201cgay tendencies.\u201d That light was quickly extinguished the next day when he said that a gay nominee would be a \u201chuge concern.\u201d His voting record and co-sponsorships leave little hope he\u2019ll change anytime soon.\n\nThe release of the HRC Scorecard for the 113th Congress, which scores members of Congress based on their support for LGBT equality, is scheduled for Thursday, October 9. The scorecard will be available online here.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "description": "14 Representatives & 5 Senators designated as most anti-LGBT members of Congress", "author": "Human Rights Campaign", "og": {"url": "http://www.hrc.org/blog/hall-of-shame/", "image": "/files/images/meta_images/Scorecard_Imageshares1-share377.jpg", "site_name": "Human Rights Campaign", "description": "14 Representatives & 5 Senators designated as most anti-LGBT members of Congress", "title": "19 Members of Congress Inducted into HRC\u2019s Hall of Shame | Human Rights Campaign"}, "image": "/files/images/meta_images/Scorecard_Imageshares1-share377.jpg", "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFDF1B", "robots": "index, follow", "fb": {"admins": 548530806, "app_id": 977970605575576}, "theme-color": "#FFDF1B", "msapplication-TileImage": "/favicon-144.png", "popular": 69, "twitter": {"site": "@HRC", "image": "/files/images/meta_images/Scorecard_Imageshares1-share377.jpg", "description": "14 Representatives & 5 Senators designated as most anti-LGBT members of Congress", "card": "summary", "title": "Human Rights Campaign"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "HRC today inducted the inaugural class of the most anti-equality members of Congress into its Hall of Shame.\nWhile there are other anti-LGBT members of Congress, these elected officials\u2019 legislative actions, votes and anti-LGBT vitriol unfortunately marks them with a modern day scarlet letter.\nIn the U.S. Senate, this includes the Child Welfare Provider Inclusion Act, the Marriage and Religious Freedom Act, and the State Marriage Defense Act.\nMultiple marriages, same-sex marriage, there\u2019s so many things that are not what the institution is supposed to be about.\nIn the 113th Congress, he introduced both the Federal Marriage Amendment and the Military Religious Freedom Protection Act."}
