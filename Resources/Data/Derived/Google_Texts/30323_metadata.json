In nearly every case, it starts with some version of service, advising, mentoring or volunteering. These are all things you\u2019re well positioned to do after amassing years of experience. It might be called the \u201cgive yourself away\u201d approach. And giving yourself away is a surefire approach to helping your skills find their next use.\n\nThere are a slew of programs that provide a structured way of offering your talents and skills to organizations that need them.\n\nOf course, nothing should stop you from giving yourself away in a structure you design for yourself. For Vicki Thomas, one winner of this year\u2019s Purpose Prize, motivation struck while she was watching a CNN segment about two young veterans who started Purple Heart Homes to retrofit foreclosed homes for wounded soldiers. With decades of public relations and marketing experience work behind her, Thomas, then 64, instantly knew that she had what was needed to help these two men take their venture to the next level. She cold-called the co-founders, offered herself up gratis, and ultimately became the organization\u2019s director of communications. In her first year on the job, revenues for the nonprofit grew by 600 %.\n\nDale Beatty and John Gallina, the co-founders of Purple Heart Homes, say that Thomas\u2019s involvement has completely changed the trajectory of their organization. But it may have changed Thomas even more. As she puts it: \u201cAs I grew older I realized that I was performing a function but missing a passion. I was contributing to someone else\u2019s purpose, but missing a purpose of my own.\u201d\n\nMarc Freedman is CEO and founder of Encore.org, a nonprofit organization working to promote encore careers\u2014second acts for the greater good.\n\nRead the latest Encore Report.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "As Ghandi said, \u201cThe best way to find yourself is in service to others.\u201d", "title": "Find Yourself Later in Life by Serving Others", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/experts/2014/01/14/find-yourself-later-in-life-by-serving-others/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/img/WSJ_profile_lg.gif"}, "site": "WSJ", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "US", "article.headline": "Find Yourself Later in Life by Serving Others", "description": "As Ghandi said, \u201cThe best way to find yourself is in service to others.\u201d", "article_section": "US", "author": "Cristina Lourosa", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "The Experts Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "The Experts", "article.summary": "As Ghandi said, \u201cThe best way to find yourself is in service to others.\u201d", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2014-01-14T19:44:06-05:00", "dj.asn": "10-158", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/experts/2014/01/14/find-yourself-later-in-life-by-serving-others/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-258B-2100", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "US", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "As Ghandi said, \u201cThe best way to find yourself is in service to others.\u201d", "title": "Find Yourself Later in Life by Serving Others", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/experts/2014/01/14/find-yourself-later-in-life-by-serving-others/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/blogs/img/WSJ_Logo_BlackBackground_1200x630social", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "The Experts", "article.id": "BL-258B-2100", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2014-01-14T19:44:18-05:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb85e\"", "article_summary": "There are a slew of programs that provide a structured way of offering your talents and skills to organizations that need them.\nDale Beatty and John Gallina, the co-founders of Purple Heart Homes, say that Thomas\u2019s involvement has completely changed the trajectory of their organization.\nIn nearly every case, it starts with some version of service, advising, mentoring or volunteering.\nAs she puts it: \u201cAs I grew older I realized that I was performing a function but missing a passion.\nAnd giving yourself away is a surefire approach to helping your skills find their next use."}
