Clearly, the Texas Democratic Party doesn\u2019t have anything to say about the rising costs of ObamaCare, the President\u2019s executive amnesty over-reach \u2013 instead \u2013 they\u2019d rather embrace the kind of politics that people in the real world are just sick and tired of.\u201d\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 Will Hailer, Executive Director of the Texas Democratic Party, spoke out against Rep. Blake Farenthold today, condemning the Corpus Christi Republican\u2019s actions.\n\nFarenthold is facing a lawsuit from a former staffer who claims that the congressman repeatedly made sexual comments towards her and created a hostile work environment.\n\n\u201cEvery day, thousands of young minds go to the capital to serve the people of the United States,\u201d Hailer said. \u201cThey do so on the hopes of building a better tomorrow for their friends, families, loved ones, and people they\u2019ve never met. Congressman Farenthold\u2019s actions are unbecoming of an elected official.\u201d\n\nLauren Greene, a former Farenthold spokeswoman, filed the suit in a Washington D.C. federal court on Friday, Dec. 12. She filed on the grounds that Farenthold violated the Congressional Accountability Act through gender discrimination and creating a hostile work environment.\n\nIn the suit, which was first reported by the National Law Journal, Greene alleged that Farenthold \u201cregularly made comments designed to gauge whether [Greene] was interested in a sexual relationship.\u201d\n\nGreene alleged that Farenthold said that \u201che was estranged from his wife and that he had not had sex with her in years.\u201d\n\nFarenthold made other sexual remarks, drank to excess, and confided in another staffer that he had \u201csexual fantasies\u201d about Greene, according to the suit.\n\nGreene also alleged that Farenthold\u2019s Chief of Staff, Bob Haueter, made her \u201cprofessional life unbearable\u201d by belittling and humiliating Greene. She brought her concerns to Farenthold, who \u201cfailed to take any action regarding Haueter\u2019s conduct,\u201d according to the suit.\n\nFarenthold spokesman Kurt Bardella, the CEO of Endeavor Strategic Communications issued a statement on the allegations to multiple news outlets yesterday:\n\n\u201cAs is the case with any pending legal situation, the congressman cannot comment on the specifics of the complaint, however, it goes without saying that both the congressman and the members of his staff who are included in this complaint have a very different view of the allegations than Ms. Greene. For the record, the office did not and does not discriminate based on sex or any other unlawful factor,\u201d Bardella said.\n\nAccording to the Houston Chronicle, a source close to Farenthold said Greene is seeking monetary damages upwards of $100,000.", "article_metadata": {"liveFyreID": "aHR0cDovL3RyYWlsYmxhemVyc2Jsb2cuZGFsbGFzbmV3cy5jb20vMjAxNC8xMi90ZXhhcy1kZW1zLXNsYW0tZmFyZW50aG9sZC1vdmVyLWV4LWFpZGVzLWFsbGVnYXRpb25zLmh0bWwv", "generator": "WordPress 3.9.12", "author": "Michael Marks", "og": {"site_name": "Trail Blazers Blog", "description": "Update Dec. 19, 9:30: Farenthold spokesman Kurt Bardella issued the following statement in response to Hailer's comments: \u201cIt\u2019s disappointing and an incredible act of hypocrisy for a former Clinton campaign\u2026", "title": "Texas Dems slam Farenthold over ex-aide\u2019s allegations", "url": "http://trailblazersblog.dallasnews.com/2014/12/texas-dems-slam-farenthold-over-ex-aides-allegations.html/", "image": "http://trailblazersblog.dallasnews.com/wp-content/themes/dallasnews/images/facebook-default-black.jpg", "type": "article"}, "LastModifiedDate": "2014-12-19T09:31:05Z", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image"}, "PublishDate": "1970-01-01T00:00:00Z", "wp-parsely_version": "1.7", "viewport": "width=device-width", "cXenseParse": {"recs": {"publishtime": "1970-01-01T00:00:00Z"}}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8908\"", "article_summary": "According to the Houston Chronicle, a source close to Farenthold said Greene is seeking monetary damages upwards of $100,000.\nGreene also alleged that Farenthold\u2019s Chief of Staff, Bob Haueter, made her \u201cprofessional life unbearable\u201d by belittling and humiliating Greene.\nShe brought her concerns to Farenthold, who \u201cfailed to take any action regarding Haueter\u2019s conduct,\u201d according to the suit.\nShe filed on the grounds that Farenthold violated the Congressional Accountability Act through gender discrimination and creating a hostile work environment.\nFarenthold is facing a lawsuit from a former staffer who claims that the congressman repeatedly made sexual comments towards her and created a hostile work environment."}
