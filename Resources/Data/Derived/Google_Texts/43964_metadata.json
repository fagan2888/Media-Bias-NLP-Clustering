Increasing the costs and financial risk of EPRs are operating costs, wall investment, improving safety and erosion of profitability, the report claimed. Compared to renewables nuclear will be more expensive than onshore wind (at \u20ac40-80 per MWh by 2018), and more expensive than solar and offshore wind power by 2020. The report urges government to take control of nuclear power, future nuclear generation, and the financial future of the country.\n\nThis article was originally published on Common Dreams.", "article_metadata": {"description": "New report shows nuclear-dependent France has historic opportunity, and enormous financial incentive, to move towards renewables.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "AUTHOR": "Jon Queally | Common Dreams", "og": {"site_name": "MintPress News", "description": "New report shows nuclear-dependent France has historic opportunity, and enormous financial incentive, to move towards renewables.", "title": "Solar And Wind Will Be Cheaper Than Nukes By End of Decade: Greenpeace", "url": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/solar-wind-will-cheaper-nukes-end-decade-greenpeace/192426/", "image": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/green_peace_france-795x416.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-06-13T13:20:09-05:00", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "New report shows nuclear-dependent France has historic opportunity, and enormous financial incentive, to move towards renewables.", "creator": "@jonqueally", "image": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/green_peace_france-795x416.jpg", "title": "Solar And Wind Will Be Cheaper Than Nukes By End of Decade: Greenpeace", "site": "@MintPressNews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"admins": 100003161352196}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/MintpressNewsMPN", "section": "Daily Digest", "tag": "renewable energy", "published_time": "2014-06-14T05:00:50-05:00", "modified_time": "2014-06-13T13:20:09-05:00"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fccc63\"", "article_summary": "Solar And Wind Will Be Cheaper Than Nukes By End of Decade: GreenpeaceNew report shows nuclear-dependent France has historic opportunity, and enormous financial incentive, to move towards renewables.\nA new report by Greenpeace in France shows that renewable energy sources like photovoltaic solar and wind will be more affordable than nuclear power by the end of the decade.\nCompared to renewables nuclear will be more expensive than onshore wind (at \u20ac40-80 per MWh by 2018), and more expensive than solar and offshore wind power by 2020.\nThe report urges government to take control of nuclear power, future nuclear generation, and the financial future of the country.\nIncreasing the costs and financial risk of EPRs are operating costs, wall investment, improving safety and erosion of profitability, the report claimed."}
