Santa Claus? No, Phil Robertson.\n\nThe \u201creality TV\u201d star landed in a cauldron of duck soup thanks to his comments on homosexuality. How odd that so many fret so much about his views and so little about others who target gay people.\n\nRobertson told GQ, \u201cNeither the adulterers, the idolaters, the male prostitutes, the homosexual offenders, the greedy, the drunkards, the slanderers, the swindlers \u2014 they won\u2019t inherit the kingdom of God.\u201d The leading man of A&E\u2019s Duck Dynasty added: \u201cIt seems like, to me, a vagina \u2014 as a man \u2014 would be more desirable than a man\u2019s anus. That\u2019s just me. I\u2019m just thinking: There\u2019s more there! She\u2019s got more to offer. I mean, come on, dudes! You know what I\u2019m saying? But hey, sin: It\u2019s not logical, my man. It\u2019s just not logical.\u201d\n\nFair enough. Like karaoke, the male posterior is not for everyone. But Robertson would have suffered less grief had he focused on religion and not drifted into sexual mechanics. Still, this story should not have exceeded 90 seconds on Entertainment Tonight.\n\nAmid transcontinental flights, Christmas carols, and family gatherings, America became obsessed with the pronouncements of a man who resembles Mullah Omar. (Why is someone so epically ungroomed in GQ anyway?) Is Phil Robertson the governor of Louisiana? Is he a U.S. senator? Does he run Apple?\n\nNope. Robertson makes duck calls.\n\nWhether he finds male anuses erotic, repugnant, or neutral \u2014 as Hillary Clinton might ask \u2014 \u201cWhat difference, at this point, does it make?\u201d\n\nIndeed, America has bigger ducks to shoot.\n\nObamacare promoters are desperate to recruit gay men among the \u201cyoung invincibles\u201d without whose premium payments Obama\u2019s entire contraption will collapse. So Out2Enroll\u2019s new Internet ad shows bare-chested men in skintight red and green briefs. They dance, decorate a Christmas tree, and generally look hot for each other. They seemingly marched in from a Gay Pride parade. This \u201cFull Frontal Freedom Production\u201d features precisely zero gay men in suits at work, in jeans doing home repairs, or in boots climbing mountains. Perhaps such images were insufficiently fabulous for Obamacare\u2019s overlords.\n\nScene from Obamacare ad aimed at gay Americans.\n\n\u201cAs a self-proclaimed \u2018fierce advocate\u2019 of gay equality, President Obama would do well to distance himself from this nonsense and denounce it immediately,\u201d said Log Cabin Republicans executive director Gregory T. Angelo. \u201cThis ad is also an example of the Left promoting harmful stereotypes that gay men are nothing more than sex-crazed lechers. If anyone on the Right made such a comparison, liberals would be apoplectic.\u201d\n\nIndeed, if Obamacare marketers pitched Hispanics, they would not depict the Gomezes in sombreros sleeping beside giant cacti. A Jewish outreach campaign would not feature the Goldberg family kvetching about health care while counting money.\n\nShame on Team Obamacare for advancing gay stereotypes!\n\nThose who screamed about Robertson and snored through this Obamacare commercial should denounce Uganda\u2019s new legislation that would boost imprisonment for \u201caggravated homosexuality\u201d from 14 years to life. This bill, strangely enough, diluted the sponsors\u2019 original intent: They wanted the death penalty. This measure awaits President Yoweri Museveni\u2019s signature.\n\nGambian president Yahya Jammeh, before the United Nations General Assembly last September, condemned \u201chomosexuality in all its forms and manifestations which though very evil, antihuman as well as anti-Allah, is being promoted as a human right by some powers. . . .
