Viewer Geraldo Bardales sent us this photo from I-25 and exit 186.

Thick black smoke and flames were visible from the interstate Saturday morning as crews rushed to contain a house fire in Castle Rock.

The fire spread to nearby trees and grass before firefighters could extinguish the blaze. The fire destroyed the house.

The home, located on the 100 block of Prairie Hawk Drive, was reportedly not being lived in at the time of the fire.

No injuries were reported.
