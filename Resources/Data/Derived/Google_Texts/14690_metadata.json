So too is the fact that Lanier Tech wants to keep its distance from other technical colleges in neighboring counties.\n\nOther criteria included availability of buildable acreage, utilities and infrastructure; compatibility with surrounding land uses; and proximity to businesses and area high schools.\n\n\u201cThe local committee evaluated several potential sites for the new Hall County campus for Lanier Tech,\u201d said Lanier Tech President Ray Perren. \u201cEach site was evaluated using established criteria based on the needs of the college. Each site was thoroughly and fairly evaluated.\u201d\n\nPerren has said he would like to acquire between 65 and 75 acres for a new campus.\n\nThe 2016 fiscal year state budget approved in April includes $10 million in bonds and $865,000 in general funds to purchase property and design a new campus for the school in Hall County.\n\nTCSG Commissioner Gretchen Corbin will make the final determination on which property to select, according to spokeswoman Alison Tyrer.\n\n\u201cOnce the decision is made, negotiations for acquisition must take place, and the final acquisition must be approved by TCSG\u2019s state board and by the State Properties Commission,\u201d she added.\n\nGov. Nathan Deal is chairman of the SPC.\n\nThe Times has confirmed the location of three of the six sites graded for consideration.\n\nOne site is land in the Chestnut Mountain area offered by Doug Magnus, president and founder of Conditioned Air Systems Inc. in Gainesville.\n\nThe land includes 121 acres near Winder Highway east of I-985. The property fronts Ponderosa Farm Road. Magnus owns several properties in that area, and is currently developing the Retreat at Chestnut Mountain, a gated subdivision with 62 lots.\n\nEach piece of land being considered reveals an ongoing competition for business between the south and north end of the counties as new growth emerges.\n\nAnother location graded by the local committee is a 76-acre tract near the Mundy Mill subdivision, with a proposed entrance off Millside Parkway.\n\nThis land is close to the current Lanier Tech campus and is being offered for $7.3 million.\n\nWilheit has also confirmed that a 145-acre property near the RaceTrac gas station and convenience store close to exit 24 on I-985 in North Hall is one of the sites also being considered.\n\nWhichever site is chosen, Lanier Tech will have significant input on developing the campus to meet its needs going forward.\n\n\u201cI firmly believe that the project is on target and that the new campus will open in fall 2018,\u201d Perren said.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.gainesvilletimes.com/archives/110795/", "image": "http://media.morristechnology.com/webmedia/facebook_share_images/gainesville/020216thetimesogimgoptimzed.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "The search for land to relocate Lanier Technical College within Hall County is now in the hands of state officials, and it is hoped that final acquisition of property to build a new campus will occur no later than early 2016.", "title": "Lanier Tech relocation search now in hands of state officials"}, "twitter": {"site": "@gtimes", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noarchive", "title": "Lanier Tech relocation search now in hands of state officials"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca0dd\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThe local committee evaluated several potential sites for the new Hall County campus for Lanier Tech,\u201d said Lanier Tech President Ray Perren.\nThis land is close to the current Lanier Tech campus and is being offered for $7.3 million.\nSo too is the fact that Lanier Tech wants to keep its distance from other technical colleges in neighboring counties.\nWhichever site is chosen, Lanier Tech will have significant input on developing the campus to meet its needs going forward.\nThe search for land to relocate Lanier Technical College within Hall County is now in the hands of state officials, and it is hoped that final acquisition of property to build a new campus will occur no later than early 2016."}
