John McCain, joined Matthew Boyle on Breitbart\u2019s Sunday news radio program to discuss the political games that led to confirmation of Obama\u2019s choice to replace Eric Holder as U.S. Attorney General. Those games are a major reason she might seek higher office.\n\n\u201cThings are going along very smoothly, we\u2019re still seeking that political and that financial pathway to see if this is going to be a possibility for me to be able to take on our sitting Senator John McCain. It is quite a bit like trying to slay a dragon,\u201d Ward said when asked about her potential candidacy.\n\nThings are going very well, fundraising is going great, there\u2019s a huge outcry, there\u2019s a huge hunger for an alternative to the status quo, to what we have right now. People are looking for somebody new, somebody fresh, somebody bold, somebody who\u2019s not afraid, somebody fearless, who\u2019s got backbone, who\u2019s not going to bow down to forces in Washington, D.C. that are not the voice of the people. A lot of people think that might be me. So I\u2019m working really hard to move forward. I think sometime in the summer we\u2019re going to be able to make a decision.\n\nBoyle then asked Ward about Loretta Lynch, who\u2019s been criticized for her support of Obama policies including his executive actions on amnesty.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t forget that our senior Senator here from Arizona voted to confirm Eric Holder. Eric Holder is Loretta Lynch light, basically. I don\u2019t think he\u2019s suddenly a conservative champion; he\u2019s just playing the game.\u201d Ward suggested that McCain would like conservatives to believe, \u201cthat his vote against Loretta Lynch this week was truly about him taking a stand against the President\u2019s unconstitutional action on immigration. He would like us to believe that,\u201d she said, \u201cbut it wasn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nWard expressed her belief that McCain was \u201cplaying politics,\u201d evidenced by his failure to launch a legitimate opposition to Lynch.\n\nHe\u2019s the senior Senator. I\u2019m told all the time about how much influence he has to be able to affect change, but he didn\u2019t use that influence to try to rally other colleagues to oppose her nomination. I think he\u2019s got failed promises all around, failed promises on our border. There\u2019s a border crisis going on here in Arizona and across our southern border. He\u2019s not leading on this issue. I really think that his general support for amnesty tells the real story.\n\nBoyle recalled McCain\u2019s 2010 campaign ads when he faced a primary challenger. In those ads McCain promised to \u201cbuild the danged fence\u201d on the southwest border with Mexico. Arizonans have since noted that no such promise has been fulfilled.\n\n\u201cI think that his failed promises on immigration ought to be a huge issue and people need to remember it,\u201d Ward said.\n\nBoyle also asked Ward whether her experience as a medical doctor would be helpful in the Senate, especially since she\u2019d be another physician involved in the Republican conference and in fighting against Obamacare.\n\nIn the emergency department, Ward said she can see the good, the bad and the ugly of Obamacare first hand.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot of bad and there\u2019s a lot of ugly. I think that some of that is because we\u2019ve had bureaucrats and ivory tower type people telling us as America what we want and what we need for our healthcare. I can tell you that, as a practicing physician, I am appalled at Obamacare. It\u2019s the reason why I ran for office. It is the biggest single takeover of patient liberty and freedom that we will ever see in our lifetime. \u201cEverybody here who\u2019s listening should be concerned because everybody has the potential to be a patient. On the patient side it affects everyone across the United States. On the physician side, for me it\u2019s a big takeover of my ability to take care of my patients, to have a doctor patient relationship, to be able to treat who I want to treat, how I want to treat them, when I want to treat them, no matter what the government says. The government wants to intervene and tell me who I can treat, when I can treat them, how much they\u2019re going to pay me, if it\u2019s worth it actuarially to treat a certain patient because of a certain age or a certain health problem that they have. We have got to never forget about Obamacare, not saying things like \u201coh well it\u2019s already the law of the land, so just deal with it.\u201d Which is what I think that our senator has done over time. He actually voted to fund Obamacare and then he scoffs at the people that want to fight against funding it and fight against Obamacare, which is a very unpopular program.\n\nBoyle asked Ward, \u201cWe\u2019ve seen a lot of people in the political establishment come after you, try to attack you\u2026are these attacks going to work?\u201d\n\n\u201cI think a lot of the attacks have already been debunked,\u201d Ward replied.\n\nWe\u2019re seeing these attacks, not necessarily for Senator McCain, but from his people. They want to try to make me seem as though I\u2019m something I\u2019m not, but I can tell you that I am a well-educated, well-spoken, down to earth, constitution loving female that wants to get into office not as a career politician, but as somebody who can serve the public and make sure that we have government of for and by the people, now and into our future. If I decide to run, that\u2019s what I will run upon.\n\nFollow Michelle Moons on Twitter @MichelleDiana", "article_metadata": {"description": "AZ State Senator Ward Calls Out Establishment GOP Political Games In Lynch Confirmation on BBNS", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "AZ State Senator Ward Calls Out Establishment GOP Political Games In Lynch Confirmation on BBNS", "title": "AZ State Senator Ward Calls Out Establishment GOP Political Games In Lynch Confirmation on BBNS - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/04/John-McCain-pointing-Reuters.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/04/27/az-senator-ward-calls-out-establishment-gop-political-games-in-lynch-confirmation-on-bbns/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "AZ State Senator Ward Calls Out Establishment GOP Political Games In Lynch Confirmation on BBNS", "creator": "@michellediana", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/04/John-McCain-pointing-Reuters.jpg", "title": "AZ State Senator Ward Calls Out Establishment GOP Political Games In Lynch Confirmation on BBNS - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "app_id": 1243316582352556, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "attorney general, confirmation, Congress, Eric Holder, GOP Establishment, loretta lynch, political games, President Barack Obama, Senate, Senator John McCain, State Senator Kelli Ward,Big Government,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "published_time": "2015-04-27T17:28:09-07:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/michdimoo", "section": "Big Government", "tag": "State Senator Kelli Ward", "categories": "Big Government"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe003f\"", "article_summary": "SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERArizona State Senator Kelli Ward is calling out the Republican establishment Republicans for enabling the confirmation of Loretta Lynch last week.\nWe\u2019re seeing these attacks, not necessarily for Senator McCain, but from his people.\nPeople are looking for somebody new, somebody fresh, somebody bold, somebody who\u2019s not afraid, somebody fearless, who\u2019s got backbone, who\u2019s not going to bow down to forces in Washington, D.C. that are not the voice of the people.\nBoyle then asked Ward about Loretta Lynch, who\u2019s been criticized for her support of Obama policies including his executive actions on amnesty.\nIt is quite a bit like trying to slay a dragon,\u201d Ward said when asked about her potential candidacy."}
