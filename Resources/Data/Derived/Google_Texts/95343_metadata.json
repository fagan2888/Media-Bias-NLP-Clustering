The bloviating, vein-popping right-wing still goes ballistic at mere mention of the word Obamacare.\n\nStill, putting aside their senseless distortions and diatribes, not too many of us have cause for celebration except perhaps the top brass from the 1300 or so private health insurers who are raking in enormous profits \u2013 health care stocks soared by almost 40 percent in 2013, the highest of any sector in the S&P 500.\n\nNonetheless, as a reminder, the controversial law does contain some important positives for regular folks. For example, it guarantees coverage for everyone without tacking on higher premiums because of pre-existing medical conditions and it requires annual free preventive-care health checks for those on Medicare.\n\nBut, five years in, as critics continue to emphasize, ACA still primarily serves as a huge government marketing campaign for private insurance companies, funneling millions of new customers with few if any restrictions on ever-escalating prices.\n\n\u201cThe ACA built upon the flaws of our market-based system and, quite predictably, is failing to contain costs and provide broad access to affordable, quality health care. Corporate interests still trump the common good in U.S. health care,\u201d according to a five-year ACA assessment appearing in the Feb. 10, 2015 International Journal of Health Services, authored by M.D. John P. Geyman.\n\nDr. Geyman is not alone. Other very prominent scholars and caregivers agree that ACA\u2019s reliance on private insurers is its downfall.\n\nFor example, the developer of the cardiac defibrillator, Dr. Bernard Lown, completely dismisses their role in providing quality care for the simple fact that \u201clike all businesses, their goal is to make money.\u201d\n\nGet What You Pay For & Nothing More\n\nIn essence, we still only get the care we can afford depending on which of the thousands of plans we subscribe. Ability to pay is still the big problem.\n\nAs a result, medical bills remain the number one reason for personal bankruptcy even though most of the petitioners have health insurance. For the rest of us, it\u2019s not much better.\n\nShockingly, roughly 40 percent of Americans have trouble paying medical bills as noted (on pg. 44) by an extremely detailed 2011 National Scorecard on U.S. Health System Performance commissioned by the Commonwealth Fund.\n\nAnd, though many have found policies with affordable premiums, the report also indicated that adults are likelier than those in other developed countries to forgo care because of cost.\n\nThe statistics are alarming.\n\nIn the past five years, according to a thorough 2015 Bloomberg review I will cite extensively, the average price to see a primary care doctor has risen 20 percent. For a specialist it\u2019s gone up 29 percent and for outpatient surgery it\u2019s up 43 percent.\n\nNo wonder, the article explains, 22 percent of people now say the cost of getting care has led them to delay treatment for a serious condition. That\u2019s the highest percentage since Gallup started asking in 2001. Another poll cited found as many as 16 million adults with chronic conditions have avoided the doctor because of out-of-pocket costs.\n\nThe Problem in a Nutshell\n\nSinglePayer Now! San Francisco organizer Don Bechler, described to me that the multiplicity and complexity of insurance plans are largely designed as \u201cmarketing lures to hook more customers.\u201d Plans are tweaked, individualized and adjusted for the particular amount of up-front money each business is willing to put up for employees.\n\nThus, Bechler explained, to seal the deal and keep premiums coming in, insurers set up a multitude of corporate plans that impose a wide variety of burdens on employees for premium-cost sharing, co-payments and deductibles.\n\nFiguring out the billing for each patient, for each physician and for each care facility among the tremendous diversity of plans, Bechler added, \u201cbecomes a nightmare fraught with delays and confusion.\u201d\n\nThis was confirmed by a recent study of private insurance Medicare Advantage programs that discovered patients were overcharged around half the time.\n\nSo, it\u2019s clear, the bloated bureaucracy that is crippling our healthcare resides in the private sector, not in government.\n\nWaste Is Revenue\n\nIn addition, the complexity of plans, each with its own marketing, paperwork, enrollment, premiums, rules and regulations, also contributes to an enormous administrative cost overhead.\n\nI spoke about this with James G. Kahn, M.D., MPH, who is a researcher at the Philip R. Lee Institute of Health Policy at the Univ. of Cal., SF, and senior author of a recent study analyzing grotesquely excessive administrative costs of insurance companies and how it diverts several hundred billions of dollars annually from actual hands-on medical treatment.\n\nWhat appears as wasteful to the normal person such as the enormous resources devoted to complicated billing and other insurance related activities (BIR), as documented by Dr.Kahn, is considered as income and revenue by insurance companies because they charge for these excesses.\n\nThus, extravagant squandering of funds and resources is endemic to the business model of insurance companies and precisely because it adds to their bottom line, there is no incentive to eliminate the bureaucratic discombobulation.\n\nHealthcare economics scholar Uwe Reinhardt expressed his exasperation even before ACA in his Nov. 19, 2008 testimony to U.S. Senate Finance Committee: \u201c900 billing clerks at Duke with 900 beds. Not sure we have a nurse for each hospital bed but we have a billing clerk. It\u2019s obscene.\u201d\n\nThis chronic problem has grown with ACA.\n\nDr. Kahn tells me that his study measured billing and other insurance-related over-costs at an astounding $375B annually. A national health system that would offer the same comprehensive care for everyone without fracturing care into thousands of different plans \u201cwould save us billions,\u201d he says.\n\nHe points to Australia and Canada, where government medical insurance administrative fees are lower than 3%, similar to our Medicare.\n\nKahn also indicated in our interview that these lower costs are sharply contrasted to the 33% administrative toll for care funded through U.S. for-profit insurers \u2013 all of which we pay.\n\nThese figures are truly stark.\n\n\u201cIt makes no sense,\u201d Kahn said, \u201cto unnecessarily spend what amounts to $1200 extra each year for every man, woman and child in the U.S. just to push papers around\u201d as part of the billing and extraneous marketing functions of insurance companies.\n\nWe have to return to a \u201cfocus on quality clinical care where the patient and health provider themselves consult directly about the best care available,\u201d Kahn emphasized, without jumping through hoops of complex and cumbersome financial restraints encoded in each policy.\n\nActivists like Bechler hope that experience with ACA will awaken more to support HR 676 National Health Care Act which provides Medicare for All or Single Payer as supported by Dr. Kahn and Dr. Geyman.\n\nRealistically, however, he says that the daunting economic and political power of insurance companies means we have a lot of grass roots organizing to do.\n\nWe must first recognize fatal flaws in the ACA and then act to get something better, Bechler suggests, by signing up for activities at http://www.singlepayernow.net/ in California or nationally at https://www.healthcare-now.org\n\nCarl Finamore is Machinist Lodge 1781 delegate to the San Francisco Labor Council, AFL-CIO.
