I thought it was humorous,\" Carleton told the Toledo Blade.\n\nThe email, riddled with grammatical and spelling errors, is written from the perspective of an African-Hispanic female student who performed well in a school spelling contest for A) being black B) \"not bringin\" drugs and guns to class C) \"not getting pregnut during the cemester.\"\n\nCarleton also makes jabs at the Affordable Care Act and affirmative action.\n\nCourtesy of the Sandusky Register, here's a copy of the email he sent out to friends, former co-workers, and the city law director\u2014\n\nFrom: Bob Carleton [mailto:bcarleton1942@gmail.com]\n\nSent: Thursday, December 12, 2013 5:08 PM\n\nTo: wheddles; Bill Kaminski; Larry Waaland; Cheryl/Rich; Ron Myers; Ron Howell; Zach Jamison; Mark Zeeb; mark johnson; Jimmy D; sandysewsassy@yahoo.com; Mark Schloemer; G.
