In particular, Ms. Swaffield noted that August\u2019s investment banking fees were the lowest monthly total in over three years, at $2.9 billion.\n\nCompared to investment banking fee revenue, trading volumes haven\u2019t dropped as much, but they were still trending down year over year according to Ms. Swaffield. As of the end of August, third-quarter U.S. equity trading was down 4% and U.S. bond trading was down 6% compared to the same period last year, she said.\n\nFixed income revenue is also widely expected to be pressured in the third quarter.\n\nEarlier this week, Jefferies Group LLC said its fiscal third-quarter profit tumbled 83% as fixed-income-trading revenue slumped 88%. Fixed-income results from Jefferies, which reports a few weeks before the large U.S. banks, are closely watched as they can hint at trends in the larger industry.\n\nFor its third quarter, Jefferies reported a compensation ratio of 56.8%, down from the 58.2% reported in the second quarter and also from the year-ago\u2019s 59.6%.\n\nStill, until September ends, some are continuing to hold out hope that trading volume could pick up and help mitigate the weakness shown in the prior two months.\n\n\u201cThe pipeline for September is very strong, but you never want to say the pipeline is done until it\u2019s done,\u201d Morgan Stanley Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat said earlier this month.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "Weak revenue in the third quarter could make it harder for investment banks to lower their compensation ratios, according to a new report from SNL Financial.", "title": "Compensation Ratios May Trouble Investment Banks", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2013/09/20/compensation-ratios-may-trouble-investment-banks/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/OB-LI409_WallSt_E_20101214083843.jpg"}, "site": "WSJMoneyBeat", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Markets", "article.headline": "Compensation Ratios May Trouble Investment Banks", "description": "Weak revenue in the third quarter could make it harder for investment banks to lower their compensation ratios, according to a new report from SNL Financial.", "article_section": "Markets", "author": "Saabira Chaudhuri", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "MoneyBeat Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "MoneyBeat", "article.summary": "Weak revenue in the third quarter could make it harder for investment banks to lower their compensation ratios, according to a new report from SNL Financial.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2013-09-20T15:09:41-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-158", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2013/09/20/compensation-ratios-may-trouble-investment-banks/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-MBB-8527", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Markets", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "Weak revenue in the third quarter could make it harder for investment banks to lower their compensation ratios, according to a new report from SNL Financial.", "title": "Compensation Ratios May Trouble Investment Banks", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2013/09/20/compensation-ratios-may-trouble-investment-banks/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/blogs/img/WSJ_Logo_BlackBackground_1200x630social", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "MoneyBeat", "article.id": "BL-MBB-8527", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2013-09-20T15:10:16-04:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd02c3\"", "article_summary": "SNL noted that lower deal volumes will likely pressure revenue, driving up the compensation-to-revenue ratios for investment banks.\nWeak revenue in the third quarter could make it harder for investment banks to lower their compensation ratios, according to a new report from SNL Financial.\nIn particular, Ms. Swaffield noted that August\u2019s investment banking fees were the lowest monthly total in over three years, at $2.9 billion.\nCompared to investment banking fee revenue, trading volumes haven\u2019t dropped as much, but they were still trending down year over year according to Ms. Swaffield.\nCompensation-to-revenue ratios are significant because by lowering these, banks are able to increase their return on equity and meet targets."}
