That overwhelms the young people\u2019s vote. That overwhelms the immigrants\u2019 vote.\u201d\n\nAfter Republican Presidential nominee Mitt Romney lost the 2012 presidential election, the Republican National Committee and College Republican National Committee both conducted postmortems in an attempt to identify the party\u2019s shortcomings.\n\nWhile the RNC conceded the party needs to revamp its messaging, both agreed outreach to Millennials was crucial to winning future elections. And the party committee began to focus its efforts on such, even going so far as to hire a director specifically to oversee youth outreach.\n\nBut Coulter said the RNC\u2019s push is \u201cspinning your wheels.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think the way you appeal to what your actual base is, which is the middle class, which is white, blue-collar workers, and apparently we\u2019re growing with black males, is to have policies that appeal to them,\u201d she said. \u201cThe Republican Party is the party of the middle class. It is the party of long-time Americans. The Democrats are the party of the very rich, of the welfare-receiving poor and of the foreigners.\u201d\n\nCoulter also noted Democrats, to the contrary, rarely make attempts to reach voters outside the party\u2019s core base.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t see Democrats fixating on, \u2018How do we get the gun rights people to vote for us?\u2019 No, they figure out what their base is and try to run the table on those demographics. That\u2019s what Republicans need to do,\u201d she said.\n\nAfter President Barack Obama won 66 and 67 percent of the youth vote in 2008 and 2012, respectively, the GOP has made outreach to Millennials a priority, especially with the upcoming 2016 election.\n\nSen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), a likely 2016 contender, has led the charge in reaching Millennials and made the National Security Agency\u2019s surveillance programs a pet issue \u2014 one that affects the tech-savvy Generation Y.\n\nWhile others look to the economy and Obamacare as issues likely to sway Millennials to vote Republican, Coulter said immigration reform is one young people should be concerned with.\n\n\u201cThe country is being changed and already has been changed,\u201d she said. \u201cMillennials can\u2019t get jobs. This is a tough economy. But just looking out across the country, if this country had the same demographics as before Teddy Kennedy\u2019s 1965 Immigration Act, Romney would\u2019ve won a bigger landslide than Reagan did in 1980. That is a massive change to this country.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"generator": "NGFB Pro 7.8.4U", "og": {"site_name": "Red Alert Politics", "description": "As the GOP boosts efforts to sway Millennials to side with the Republican Party, political pundit Ann Coulter is shunning such efforts, saying the GOP is \"spinning your wheels\" with tactics to reach Generation Y.", "title": "Ann Coulter: GOP 'spinning wheels' with youth outreach - Red Alert...", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://redalertpolitics.com/files/2014/04/Ann-Coulter-600x400.jpg", "height": 400}, "url": "http://redalertpolitics.com/2014/04/12/ann-coulter-gop-spinning-wheels-youth-outreach/", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 1285945407, "app_id": 529886110401651}, "msvalidate.01": "0F003B4674EABE0F24651B476B61A43C", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/RedAlertPolitics", "tag": "youth-vote", "published_time": "2014-04-12T15:33:52+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-04-12T18:15:23+00:00", "author": "melissa.quinn.9461"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdffc1\"", "article_summary": "\u201cIncrease the blue-collar, white, male vote, or just the white vote, say, but just 2 percentage points.\n\u201cWe may not be able to win the youth vote the same way we may not be able to win the immigrant vote,\u201d she told Red Alert Politics.\n\u201cThe Republican Party is the party of the middle class.\nWhile others look to the economy and Obamacare as issues likely to sway Millennials to vote Republican, Coulter said immigration reform is one young people should be concerned with.\n\u201cIf you could just increase the white vote, the white, male, blue-collar vote, that\u2019s still a much bigger demographic than either young people or recent immigrants,\u201d the conservative pundit said."}
