Paid $125 per book, she never collected any royalties.\n\nBenson died in 2002 at 96 and left her home and possessions to her only daughter, Peggy Wirt, who died in January.\n\nAuctioneer Jade Montrie, who is handling the estate sale, said many of the items came from Benson\u2019s home office, where she wrote for decades.\n\n\u201cWhen we went into Mildred\u2019s office, it was kind of like a time capsule,\u201d he said.\n\nBooks, papers, awards, four typewriters and a wooden desk filled the room. The desk was where the family said Benson wrote many of her books and newspaper columns, Montrie said.\n\n\u201cIt looks like it came from another era,\u201d said Lois Kovar, Benson\u2019s great-niece. \u201cThe writing room was always Millie\u2019s. That was like her little cove.\u201d\n\nA typewriter that Benson used to write the Nancy Drew stories was donated to the Smithsonian Institution years ago. Her daughter left a collection of her mother\u2019s books to the University of Iowa, which was Benson\u2019s alma mater.\n\nBenson was hired in 1930 to write the books based on plot outlines written by Edward Stratemeyer, the famed book publisher who also was behind the Bobbsey Twins and Hardy Boys.\n\nMost scholars credit Benson with developing the character of Nancy Drew, who wore stylish cardigan sweater sets while climbing through attics and haunted mansions in search of clues and catching jewel thieves and kidnappers.\n\nDozens of ghost writers followed Benson, also writing under the Keene name. Harriet Adams, Stratemeyer\u2019s daughter, took over and directed writers in the 1950s to make the stories shorter and faster-paced. The books are still in publication, though the main character has evolved with the times since her debut in 1930.\n\nBenson was bound by an agreement with the publisher not to publicly reveal her identity as the series\u2019 original author, but it became known in 1980 when she testified in a court case involving Nancy Drew\u2019s publisher.\n\nThere\u2019s no indication that the desk being put up for bid is where Benson wrote the tales of Nancy Drew, but her family has said that\u2019s where she wrote many of her other books and columns.\n\nOther items being sold include a Mystery Writers of America award, autographed letters and newspaper clippings, and a copy of \u201cRediscovering Nancy Drew\u201d that she inscribed for her daughter. The book details how the series was created.\n\n\u201cThis is a fine account of how my identity as Nancy Drew\u2019s author became known,\u201d Benson wrote inside the book. She signed it \u201cThe \u2018real\u2019 Nancy Drew.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Ohio auction features items from Nancy Drew author", "title": "Ohio auction features items from Nancy Drew author", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2013/12/07/ohio-auction-features-items-from-nancy-drew-author/", "image": {"width": 456, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20131207__2daa36f8-1c0c-4a08-aae0-5bc54b904437lsoriginalph.jpg", "height": 640}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20131207__2daa36f8-1c0c-4a08-aae0-5bc54b904437lsoriginalph.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2013-12-07T17:17:50+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-28T18:54:17+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8408\"", "article_summary": "TOLEDO, Ohio \u2014 Typewriters and a desk from the home of an author who brought a young sleuth named Nancy Drew to life are going up for auction.\n\u201cThis is a fine account of how my identity as Nancy Drew\u2019s author became known,\u201d Benson wrote inside the book.\nShe wrote 23 of the 30 original Nancy Drew stories using the pseudonym Carolyn Keene.\nBenson wrote more than 130 books, including the 1940s Penny Parker mystery series, but she is best known for the Nancy Drew books that inspired and captivated generations of girls.\nShe signed it \u201cThe \u2018real\u2019 Nancy Drew.\u201d"}
