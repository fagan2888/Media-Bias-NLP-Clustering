Clarke did not put the blame on China for the attack, however. He instead put the blame on the Obama administration for not “taking the issue seriously enough” and then simply stated that the hack is “almost criminal negligence.”

“I don’t blame the Chinese. This is what intelligence agencies do. This is what the we, the United States, do. We steal this sort of information. I blame the Obama administration for taking this issue not seriously enough. This is almost criminal negligence.”
