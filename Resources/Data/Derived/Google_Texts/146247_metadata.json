So widely known are the site\u2019s woes that \u201cObamacare\u201d has become a lazy joke \u2014 a byword for catastrophe than merely needs to be repeated to elicit laughter. In recent weeks, it has appeared in various forms on homemade signs at football games, in late-night monologues, and in a thousand memes across the apolitical Internet. Mockery being perhaps the most difficult attack to counter, this will be a difficult blow from which to recover.\n\nWhich makes it all the more peculiar that advocates have taken to selling the long lines as a virtue \u2014 a feature, not a bug. \u201cBy GOP logic,\u201d MSNBC\u2019s Alex Wagner inexplicably tweeted on Monday, \u201cblack friday was a complete failure because of all those people lined up outside the stores.\u201d Leaving to one rather large side the fact that private stores judge their successes not by the size of the queues but by the number of items that they sell, this really isn\u2019t the pitch I\u2019d be making. Conservatives have been warning from the outset that the federal government can\u2019t run a system this large, that forcing people to become reliant upon exchanges run by Washington, D.C., was a mistake, and that rationing was unavoidable. They have been painting pictures of shoddy treatment and long lines. These critiques have been sharpened, not overwritten, by the rollout. What gives?\n\nNevertheless, pointing to the size of the backlog has been a mainstay of the progressive defense. From the Washington Post\u2019s Wonkblog, through the Daily Kos, to the White House itself, \u201clook at all the people trying to get onto the site!\u201d has been the tactic du choix through launch, failure, and relaunch. If conservatives should worry that a working website will remove one weapon from their arsenal, progressives should be waking up at night quivering at the thought that their apologists are drawing attention to their movement\u2019s historical b\u00eate noire: the queue.\n\nThus far, Obamacare\u2019s principal achievement has been to kick millions of people off of plans with which they were happy while mandating that they buy replacement insurance through a government-run choke point that\u2019s sometimes just closed entirely. I suspect that, if the website is ever truly \u201cfixed,\u201d the law is going to become more, not less, of a liability for the Left. Either way, it is almost certain that next time somebody suggests a vast government program as the remedy to America\u2019s ills, it will be more than just conservative critics who say, as one, \u201cyour heart\u2019s in the right place, but remember how Obamacare went\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0\u201d\n\n\u2014 Charles C.
