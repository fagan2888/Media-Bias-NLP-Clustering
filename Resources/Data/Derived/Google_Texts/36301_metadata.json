(Photo: George Walker IV / File / The Tennessean)Buy Photo\n\nInsure Tennessee would have brought tens of thousands of Tennesseans into the fold of health insurance and made a dent in the amount of charity care provided around the state.\n\nInsure Tennessee is Gov. Bill Haslam's proposed insurance expansion plan using Medicaid funding that was twice defeated in state Senate committees.\n\nA new report from the White House Council of Economic Advisers estimated that Tennessee would have received $1.77 billion in federal money \u2014 from a payroll tax people in the state already pay \u2014 and saved 220 lives a year if the state had expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nInsure Tennessee, which the Haslam administration does not consider traditional Medicaid expansion, is a hot-button issue for supporters and critics alike.\n\nState Democrats recently pushed for a new special session, and health care professionals lament the effects of neglected care. The initiative, which has not gone to a full vote in the General Assembly, faces an uphill battle from a core group of lawmakers who remain opposed.\n\nThe Tennessee Hospital Association this year estimated the number of people in each county who would have been eligible for Insure Tennessee.
