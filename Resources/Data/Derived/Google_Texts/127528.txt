WellComp Managed Care Services, Inc. , one of the nation's leading providers of comprehensive managed care services for workers' compensation and liability claims, earned top marks in a Texas Department of Insurance survey of workers' compensation claims.

Findings from the 2014 Workers' Compensation Network Report Card Results recently published by the Texas Department of Insurance shows Wellcomp's network (referred to in the study as Forte) ranked one or two on multiple key industry measurements, including overall medical costs, medical-only costs, lost-time claims, professional costs and pharmacy costs. In addition, injured employees whose cases were managed by WellComp enjoyed higher levels of satisfaction with their medical care and promptness with their treatment.

"As pleased as we are to receive the findings from the Texas report, I'm not at all surprised with the results," said WellComp President Doug Markham . "The team at WellComp is exceptional in every sense of the word: experienced, dedicated and caring. I couldn't be more proud of the valued care they deliver every day to our clients and their insureds."

Key findings from the study:

• WellComp had the lowest average per claim medical costs for medical-only claims and lost-time claims out of all data sources studied.

• Among the 1305 networks studied, WellComp had the 2nd lowest overall average per claim medical costs, and the 2nd lowest average per claim professional costs.

• WellComp had the highest percentage of injured employees reporting satisfaction with their treating doctor of any 1305 network, and the 2nd highest percentage of workers satisfied with the quality of their medical care.

Rebranding to WellComp complete

"The study results also happen to coincide with another piece of timely news," stated Markham. "Rebranding efforts are nearing completion and Forte will henceforth be known as WellComp Managed Care Services, Inc. While the name may be changing, this is a good opportunity to emphasize that the exceptional results reported in the Texas study are the exact standard of performance our customers have always and will continue to receive from WellComp."
