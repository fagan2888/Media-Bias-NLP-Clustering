Most economists predict (and the Fed has indicated) that an increase in short-term interest rates is all but certain for 2015.\n\nHow much of an increase and when it actually occurs will be based on labor market conditions, inflation indicators, and other financial developments. The better the economy does, the sooner and faster the Fed will increase rates \u2013 which follows the Fed\u2019s recent decision to end quantitative easing, the bond-buying program that bolstered the economy and stimulated the stock market, which has risen about 131 percent.\n\nRelated: Is the Fed Wrong Again on Interest Rate Hikes and Inflation?\n\nMany investors wonder what impact rising interest rates will have on their portfolios and what strategies can best help them navigate a potentially volatile period.\n\n\u201cInvestors, especially those seeking current income, need to consider not only the probability of rising rates but also the probability that rates, even if rising, could remain at historical lows for a long time,\u201d says David Bruckman, managing director at Citrin Cooperman Wealth Management, a New York-based accounting firm.\n\nThere\u2019s no one-size-fits-all answer, but here are some tips that can help you think about the best moves. Remember not to make any moves based on current headlines, but rather on a long-term strategy meant to withstand the market\u2019s inherent ups and downs.\n\nBONDS\n\nA rise in rates can do significant harm to bond assets, but advisors don\u2019t recommend investors unload all of their bonds. Short duration bonds are less susceptible to interest rates moves, and high-quality tax-free municipal bonds might be a good move for more conservative investors.\n\nRelated: 3 Steps to a More Fed-Proof Portfolio\n\nBruckman of Citrin Cooperman says that the rise in interest rates is less important if buyers of individual bonds plan to hold them to maturity. For investors who purchase bond funds, ETFs and actively managed mutual funds are a good solution.\n\nFor clients seeking current income, look for funds that focus on high-yield bonds, floating-rate notes, and international bonds. Short-term bond funds are a good hedge against the blow of potentially rising interest rates, Bruckman advises.\n\nAnother option: so-called unconstrained bond funds that allow managers the leeway to diversify positions in order to react to the market.\n\n\u201cFor certain clients, treasury inflation protected securities (TIPS) should help over time to insulate a diversified portfolio against persistent rising rates, assuming such increases are accompanied by an increase in inflation,\u201d says Bruckman.\n\nRelated: 3 Strategies for Making Your Retirement Money Last\n\nClare Sheridan, a former financial advisor at Morgan Stanley, says investors with a really strong conviction about rates going up might buy a floating-rate note: Its rate varies with market movement. She doesn\u2019t believe that investors who want to generate income should be drastically changing their bond exposure.\n\n\u201cIf you are trying to hedge against the stock market going down, then you\u2019ll probably be in a longer-duration fixed-income bond,\u201d Sheridan says. \u201cIf you just want to preserve capital, you\u2019d be in a short, pretty safe, not very exciting investment.\u201d\n\nSTOCKS/EQUITIES\n\nIt\u2019s more difficult to predict the impact increasing interest rates will have on equities, since so many factors influence how the market behaves. \u201cThe higher rates over the near term tend to have negative impact on the stock market, but if you look out at longer period of times, it\u2019s actually a benefit,\u201d says Michael Sabatino, managing director at McGraw-Hill Federal Credit Union.\n\nWhen investors become frightened by the possibility of inflation, he says, that tends to create more market volatility \u2014 but in long-term cycles, owning stock is a way to protect against inflation.\n\nRelated: 6 Smart Ways to Get Ahead of Rising Interest Rates\n\nSarah Carlson, a private wealth manager at Fulcrum Financial Group in Spokane, Washington, recommends clients pursue high quality dividend-paying stocks. She\u2019s looking at opportunities in health care and technology as bright spots that will continue to be sectors of what she calls American dominance.\n\nIf your stock holdings have grown disproportionately to the rest of your portfolio (they probably have), now might be a good time to take your profits and rebalance.\n\nALTERNATIVE INVESTMENTS\n\nFor those able to take on more risk, commodity trading and broad-based metals tend to rise with inflation and could serve as another hedge to rising rates.\n\nOther potential alternative investments include master limited partnerships (MLPs), which are publically traded partnerships usually involved in real estate, petroleum and natural gas extraction businesses; absolute return funds, where managers have more discretion about the type of asset classes they can invest in; and real estate investment trusts (REITs). Investing a small portion of your portfolio in these investments could be a good move, but as always, check with a trusted advisor beforehand.\n\nRelated: Not Ready for Retirement? That\u2019s a Problem\n\nANNUITIES\n\nFor retirees who need a fixed income, annuities may make sense and offer the peace of mind that comes with guaranteed income. \u201cFor older clients, an immediate annuity will offer considerably greater cash flow than that from a traditional fixed income portfolio,\u201d Bruckman says.\n\nCASH/MONEY MARKET/SAVINGS ACCOUNTS/CDs\n\nAfter years of offering paltry returns, these old standbys could actually start to collect some interest. \u201cOlder folks who own CDs would benefit from the additional rate,\u201d says Michael Sabatino of the McGraw-Hill Federal Credit Union. \u201cIt would be a positive for retirees generally who have these fixed income instruments which would generate more yield.\u201d\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The days of record low interest rates may finally be nearing an end.", "title": "How Rising Interest Rates Could Affect Your Portfolio", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2014/11/20/How-Rising-Interest-Rates-Could-Affect-Your-Portfolio", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/07082014_Stock_Market_Finance_Chart.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2014/11/20/How-Rising-Interest-Rates-Could-Affect-Your-Portfolio", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/07082014_Stock_Market_Finance_Chart.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "The days of record low interest rates may finally be nearing an end.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcba74\"", "article_summary": "Short-term bond funds are a good hedge against the blow of potentially rising interest rates, Bruckman advises.\nMany investors wonder what impact rising interest rates will have on their portfolios and what strategies can best help them navigate a potentially volatile period.\nMost economists predict (and the Fed has indicated) that an increase in short-term interest rates is all but certain for 2015.\nThe days of record low interest rates may finally be nearing an end.\n\u201cFor certain clients, treasury inflation protected securities (TIPS) should help over time to insulate a diversified portfolio against persistent rising rates, assuming such increases are accompanied by an increase in inflation,\u201d says Bruckman."}
