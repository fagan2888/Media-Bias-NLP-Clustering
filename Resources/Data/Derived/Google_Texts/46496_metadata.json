Additionally, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) released high-profile new rules that call on power plants to cut their carbon emissions 30 percent by 2030.\n\nRepublicans have criticized the power plant rules as an attack on coal producing states like Kentucky and West Virginia, which are both home to top Senate and House campaigns this year.\n\nFoxx cast the transportation bill as an extension of the Obama administration\u2019s effort to address climate issues.\n\n\u201cSince day one, this Administration has worked to protect our environment and mitigate the effects of climate change,\u201d he wrote. \u201cLast week's All-of-the-Above report and yesterday's EPA proposal to cut carbon emissions at America's power plants are two more steps toward the sustainability our nation needs to achieve. If passed, GROW AMERICA would be another step down the road to a greener economy and healthier communities.\u201d\n\nDespite the environmental benefits Foxx was touting Tuesday, Obama\u2019s transportation proposal is mostly an effort to address a shortfall in federal transportation that is expected to occur as early as August without congressional action.\n\nThe Department of Transportation\u2019s Highway Trust Fund has been forecast to go bankrupt by the end of the summer.\n\nThe traditional source of funding for the transportation trust fund is revenue that is collected from the federal gas tax, which is currently priced at 18.4 cents per gallon.\n\nObama is proposing that lawmakers increase annual transportation spending from approximately $50 billion per year to about $75 billion. The gas tax, which is also expire if the transportation bill is not renewed this summer, only brings in approximately $34 billion per year however.\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office has projected that lawmakers would need an extra $100 billion in addition to the expected gas tax revenue to have enough money to pay for a six-year transportation, which is longer than Obama\u2019s proposal and the length that is being sought by the Senate and infrastructure advocates.\n\nThe Obama administration is suggesting that lawmakers approve a shorter measure to increase the amount of money that is spent annually on roads and bridges. The president\u2019s proposal calls for using approximately $150 billion from a corporate tax reform proposal that is unlikely to be approved this year to help pay for the transportation project.\n\nRepublicans have balked at the idea of using money corporate tax reform, instead releasing a proposal to use money from cuts at the U.S. Postal Service to pay for a one-year extension of the current transportation bill.\n\nDemocrats and transportation and Post Office labor groups have vigorously opposed the House GOP\u2019s proposal.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.title": "Foxx: Obama transportation bill would protect environment", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.modified": "2014-06-03T17:02-04:00", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "title": "Foxx: Obama transportation bill would protect environment", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/transportation/208098-foxx-obama-transportation-bill-would-protect-environment", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/blogs/foxxanthony_052213aw_1.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-06-03T17:02:25-04:00", "type": "article"}, "Smart_Paging": "on", "author": "Keith Laing", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/transportation/208098-foxx-obama-transportation-bill-would-protect-environment", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "dcterms.date": "2014-06-03T15:33-04:00", "dcterms.creator": "Keith Laing", "dcterms.type": "Text", "article": {"published_time": "2014-06-03T15:33:29-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-06-03T17:02:25-04:00"}, "keywords": "Climate change policy, Department of Transportation, Highway Trust Fund shortfall, Gas Tax, MAP-21 Reauthorization,Anthony Foxx, Barack Obama,", "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/transportation/208098-foxx-obama-transportation-bill-would-protect-environment", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "card": "summary", "title": "Foxx: Obama transportation bill would protect environment"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fddb6c\"", "article_summary": "Foxx said Tuesday that the measure, known as the Grow America Act, would have benefits for the environment as well as the nation\u2019s commuter.\nFoxx cast the transportation bill as an extension of the Obama administration\u2019s effort to address climate issues.\nObama is proposing that lawmakers increase annual transportation spending from approximately $50 billion per year to about $75 billion.\nThe gas tax, which is also expire if the transportation bill is not renewed this summer, only brings in approximately $34 billion per year however.\n\u201cI'm also happy to share that GROW AMERICA has a number of features that would improve the environmental sustainability of American transportation,\u201d the DOT chief continued."}
