Cycling chiefs and experts generally agree that the era of widespread doping is over, but few would claim to know that today\u2019s pack is fully clean. Drugs testers will conduct hundreds of blood and urine checks during the race.\n\nBookmakers\u2019 odds foresee a victory either by defending champion Chris Froome, a 29-year-old Kenyan-born Briton who leads Team Sky, or two-time champ Alberto Contador \u2014 a 31-year-old Spaniard with Tinkoff-Saxo Bank \u2014 to take home the yellow jersey when the race finishes on Paris\u2019 Champs-Elysees on July 26.\n\nFew of the 198 riders on the 22 teams stand a realistic chance of winning, based on recent performances, skill sets and team priorities. Most are \u201cdomestiques\u201d who race above all to help their team leaders win. Vincenzo Nibali of Italy, plus Spaniards Alejandro Valverde and Joaquin Rodriguez, stand an outside chance.\n\nConceding home-road advantage, Contador said Friday that \u201clocal hero\u201d Froome remains the favorite. The Briton, who succeeded Sky teammate and compatriot Bradley Wiggins as Tour winner, said: \u201cI don\u2019t think many Tour champions get to come back as defending champions and can start in front of their home crowd.\u201d\n\nFive of the 21 stages end in summit finishes, which usually promise drama as the cream of the climbers rises to the top first. In all, the riders will cover 3,664 kilometers (2,277 miles) of roads in England, France, Belgium and Spain.\n\nAside from cobblestone treachery in Stage 5, the mountains mostly matter this year. For the first time in 61 years, this Tour has only one long time trial \u2014 a race-against-the-clock, where racers set off one-by-one down a starter\u2019s ramp. It comes in Stage 20. Contador and Froome are among the best in both climbing and time-trialing.\n\nThis year marks the second time that the Tour de France is starting in Britain, after a successful time in London in 2007. Local officials use municipal funds to pay for the right to host the race in their cities, hoping for short-term tourism revenues plus a longer-term return from the international media spotlight.\n\nThe Tour\u2019s route changes every year. After three stages in England, this 101st edition enters France on Tuesday. The riders will cover many of the same roads their forebears covered since the race was first run in 1903. Among novelties this year: the first-ever Chinese rider in the race, Cheng Ji, and 11 climbs in the eastern Vosges mountains \u2014 though long, steep ascents await in the Alps and Pyrenees too.\n\nIf turnout on English roads during the 2007 Tour de France is any precedent \u2014 when millions lined up two- to three-people deep to watch the pack zip by \u2014 expect big crowds again this year.\n\nSaturday\u2019s 190.5-kilometer (118-mile) rolling Stage 1 from Leeds to Harrogate is likely to favor sprinters. The Tour\u2019s green jersey goes to the best overall sprinter, one of many subplots to the overall title chase which includes pure climbers seeking the polka-dot jersey to be the best man in the mountains.\n\nMany of the Union Jack-waving spectators will want Britain\u2019s Mark Cavendish, perhaps the best sprinter of his generation, to get his 26th career Tour stage victory in Harrogate, his mother\u2019s hometown. If he does, he\u2019ll wear the race leader\u2019s yellow jersey for the first time in his career \u2014 a coveted honor.\n\nKate, the Duchess of Cornwall, will do the honors in bestowing the prized shirt at the awards ceremony on Saturday, joining her husband Prince William and Prince Harry for a royal welcome for the French Republic\u2019s best-known annual sporting event.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Tour de France gears up for UK start", "title": "Tour de France gears up for UK start", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/07/04/tour-de-france-gears-up-for-uk-start/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140704_082240_tour-de-france.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140704_082240_tour-de-france.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-07-04T20:26:29+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T05:46:58+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0d63\"", "article_summary": "In all, the riders will cover 3,664 kilometers (2,277 miles) of roads in England, France, Belgium and Spain.\nThis weekend, fans of many stripes could join die-hard cycling buffs and tune in to the start of the 101st Tour de France for that much needed sports fix.\nThis year marks the second time that the Tour de France is starting in Britain, after a successful time in London in 2007.\nMany of the Union Jack-waving spectators will want Britain\u2019s Mark Cavendish, perhaps the best sprinter of his generation, to get his 26th career Tour stage victory in Harrogate, his mother\u2019s hometown.\nIf he does, he\u2019ll wear the race leader\u2019s yellow jersey for the first time in his career \u2014 a coveted honor."}
