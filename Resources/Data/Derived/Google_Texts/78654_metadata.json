My Wall Street Journal review of the book is here (non-WSJ subscribers can Google: \u201cWSJ Randy Barnett Clark Neily\u201d to access the full text).\n\nWhile the substance of Will\u2019s column is great, the title is unfortunate. \u201cJudicial activism\u201d was devised to be pejorative, but it has little content. Most invocations purport to be condemning the judicial invalidation of a law that was enacted by the supposedly more representative and accountable legislators in Congress or state legislatures. Judges, we have long been instructed by progressives such as Teddy Roosevelt and conservatives such as Robert Bork, should not thwart the \u201cwill of the people\u201d as embodied in the acts of legislatures. Yet, because almost everyone thinks that unconstitutional laws ought to be invalidated, what \u201cactivism\u201d really means is improperly invalidating a law that is not really unconstitutional. So the real sin is not invalidating a \u201cpopularly-enacted law\u201d \u2014 nearly everyone is for doing this sometimes \u2014 but misinterpreting the Constitution.\n\nNeily (and Will) object to a philosophy of \u201cjudicial restraint\u201d that adopts a rule of construction found nowhere in the Constitution requiring judges to uphold a law if they can make up any possible legitimate reason why a legislature might have enacted it, regardless of whether the law was enacted for such a reason or not. This modern \u201crational basis\u201d review originated in the 1955 case of Williamson v. Lee Optical. According to this rule of construction, when a member of the sovereign people contends that his or her liberty has been unreasonably restricted by his or her \u201cagent\u201d or \u201cservant\u201d in the legislature, a judge (who is also merely an agent of the People) is supposed to automatically side with the legislature against the citizen in virtually every case. In his book, Neily explains at great length, and with numerous real-world examples, what an abdication of judicial duty this is.\n\nI cannot offer a complete defense of Neily\u2019s thesis here. You really need to read the book for yourself. My point is more limited. If \u201cjudicial activism\u201d means improperly invalidating laws that are not unconstitutional, then Neily does not favor this, and neither do Will or I. For this reason, Neily and I call this approach \u201cjudicial engagement\u201d not judicial activism. Similarly, if \u201cjudicial restraint\u201d means only invalidating laws that are unconstitutional, then he and I both favor such restraint. What we reject is judges closing their eyes \u2014 or rewriting statutes such as the Affordable Care Act \u2014 so they may \u201cdefer\u201d to legislative will and uphold legislation without assessing whether the legislation is properly within the power of Congress or state legislatures to enact. Instead of \u201cjudicial conservatism,\u201d which admonishes judges to put their thumbs on the scale to uphold laws, we favor \u201cconstitutional conservatism\u201d in which judges are restrained to follow the Constitution, whether this leads to upholding or invalidating legislation.\n\nThe real dispute between some judicial conservatives and us is over the proper scope of the enumerated powers of Congress and, especially, the unenumerated police powers of states. Also in dispute is the original meaning of such \u201clost\u201d clauses as the Ninth Amendment and the Privileges or Immunities Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, which were written in general terms precisely because the rightful liberties of the people are so capacious they cannot all be enumerated or listed. We believe that both of these lost clauses are expressions of popular sovereignty in which the \u201crights . . . retained by the people\u201d are to be protected against unreasonable restrictions from the federal government, just as the \u201cprivileges or immunities\u201d of citizens are to be protected against the states, by adopting implementing doctrines like those that courts today use to protect the natural right of freedom of speech. Those who reject implementing these provisions because these clauses don\u2019t meet their standards of specificity would disregard the written Constitution in the name of their own conception of \u201cthe rule of law,\u201d just as surely as others reject the written Constitution because it does not comport with their own conception of \u201csocial justice.\u201d Both positions should be rejected by constitutional conservatives.\n\nThe debate over the original meaning of the Ninth Amendment and Privileges or Immunities Clause should be decided by evidence, not label-mongering. For a summary of this evidence see my book, Restoring the Lost Constitution. For a more detailed scholarly evaluation of the available evidence see my articles here and here. In the appropriate forum, I am happy to debate the original meaning of these terms with anyone who is willing to consider seriously the evidence of original meaning that exists, not merely assert ex cathedra what they \u201cmust\u201d mean, or who shift the subject to judicial role rather than original meaning.\n\nClark Neily and George Will are advocating that the judiciary, as a co-equal branch of the federal government, should be \u201crestrained\u201d to follow the Constitution, properly interpreted, whether that leads to upholding or invalidating legislation. Given its origin and common usage,\u201djudicial activism\u201d is an unfortunate choice of terms to describe this. \u201cJudicial engagement\u201d is both a less pejorative and more accurate label for how a constitutionally conservative judge should act.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Critics of George Will and Clark Neily's defense of \"judicial engagement\" are attacking a straw man.", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Critics of George Will and Clark Neily's defense of \"judicial engagement\" are attacking a straw man.", "title": "\u201cJudicial engagement\u201d is not the same as \u201cjudicial activism\u201d", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2014/01/28/judicial-engagement-is-not-the-same-as-judicial-activism/", "image": "https://images.washingtonpost.com/?url=https://img.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/twp-3000x1568.jpg&w=1484&op=resize&opt=1&filter=antialias", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@RandyEBarnett"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2014/01/28/judicial-engagement-is-not-the-same-as-judicial-activism/", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0"}, "article_summary": "For this reason, Neily and I call this approach \u201cjudicial engagement\u201d not judicial activism.\n\u201cJudicial activism\u201d was devised to be pejorative, but it has little content.\nIf \u201cjudicial activism\u201d means improperly invalidating laws that are not unconstitutional, then Neily does not favor this, and neither do Will or I.\nIn his book, Neily explains at great length, and with numerous real-world examples, what an abdication of judicial duty this is.\n\u201cJudicial engagement\u201d is both a less pejorative and more accurate label for how a constitutionally conservative judge should act."}
