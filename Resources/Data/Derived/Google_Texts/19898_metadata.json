Matt Gaetz\u2018s campaign said Monday his U.S. House bid is picking up steam quickly, raising $350,000 during his first 10 days, including a $100,000 commitment from Gaetz himself.\n\nGaetz is running for Congressional District 1, an open seat incumbent U.S. Rep. Jeff Miller is exiting after announcing his retirement from Congress in March.\n\nThe Gaetz camp touted the big fundraising figures as a sign of strength in the deep-red district.\n\n\u201cNorthwest Floridians are clearly ready for principled conservative reform. Our campaign is building a solid infrastructure of volunteers and resources to get the job done,\u201d said Gaetz in a news release. \u201cI want to thank the dozens of volunteers, hundreds of local donors and thousands of followers on social media who are already helping us share the virtue of strong citizens and limited government. We are eager to add even more folks to the team in the coming weeks and months.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m fully committed to take the fight to Washington and stand up for Northwest Florida\u2019s values. Whether it\u2019s securing our border, eradicating Muslim terrorists, supporting our veterans, protecting 2nd Amendment rights, repealing Obamacare, or balancing the budget, I will fight to restore America,\u201d said Gaetz, a Fort Walton Beach Republican.\n\nThe announcement comes after first quarter fundraising totals are required to be reported to the Federal Elections Commission on April 15 for all money raised between Jan. 1 and March 31.\n\nGaetz originally declared a run for the state Senate seat occupied by his father, former Senate President Don Gaetz, but Miller\u2019s announcement he would retire from Congress led to a pivot to the federal seat.
