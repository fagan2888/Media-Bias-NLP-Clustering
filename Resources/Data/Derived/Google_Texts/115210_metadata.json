At issue were his inaccurate statements relating to trading arms for hostages in what became the Iran-contra scandal. For damage control, the administration tapped the talents of an American original named David Abshire.\n\n\u201cDoctor Abshire,\u201d as he liked to be called\u2014he\u2019d earned a PhD in history at Georgetown\u2014was a West Point graduate, former Korean War platoon leader, and co-founder of Washington\u2019s non-partisan Center for Strategic and International Studies. He had served every postwar Republican president in some capacity and would go on to head the Center for the Study of the Presidency & Congress.\n\nWhat Abshire learned during his time in service he distilled into a single phrase: \u201cTrust,\u201d he often said, \u201cis the coin of the realm.\u201d It was even the subtitle of his book on how he helped restore Reagan\u2019s reputation.\n\nAbshire died last year at age 88 after a good long life. But he went too soon, by which I mean that we could use him right about now. This is especially true of President Obama.\n\nTwo days before the San Bernardino mass murders, I was a guest on a call-in show on Wisconsin Public Radio. It\u2019s an arm of NPR, so the callers were, let\u2019s just say, decidedly left of center. One mentioned \u201cthe Koch brothers\u201d in tones one might reserve for \u201cNazi Party.\u201d A second caller alluded casually to the \u201cdiscredited and doctored\u201d Planned Parenthood tapes; a third mumbled something about deporting \u201cwhite Christians.\u201d\n\nThe most sensible-sounding interlocutor was a self-described conservative who says he accepts the fact of global warming\u2014and human responsibility for it\u2014but has trouble accepting anything at face value proposed by Barack Obama in the way of a solution. Why? Because Obama has a credibility gap with this man, who cited the president\u2019s assurances while lobbying for the Affordable Care Act that Americans who already had health insurance could keep their plans and their doctors. The caller also mentioned the administration\u2019s spurious assertions about the 2012 killing of four Americans in Benghazi.\n\nComparing health care and Benghazi to climate change policy seems a non sequitur. But as David Abshire could attest, they aren\u2019t. A president\u2019s credibility is fungible, and if voters conclude their commander-in-chief misleads them for partisan advantage about one thing, they assume he does it about others. Many Obama critics are convinced that the reason top administration officials, including Hillary Clinton, tied themselves into rhetorical pretzels while dissembling over Benghazi is that the specter of al-Qaeda commandos torching a U.S. consulate and murdering Americans directly undermined the president\u2019s campaign-year slogan \u201cOsama is dead, al-Qaeda is on the run.\u201d\n\nDeep into his second term, Obama has continued his habit of sounding dismissive about facts that don\u2019t fit his party\u2019s narrative. He flippantly described the Islamic State as al-Qaeda\u2019s \u201cjayvee team.\u201d Hours before the ISIS terrorist attacks in Paris, Obama airily asserted that ISIS has been \u201ccontained.\u201d Even afterward he said he didn\u2019t \u201cwant to speculate\u201d on who perpetrated them or why\u2014despite reports of the gunmen shouting \u201cAllahu Akbar\u201d and \u201cThis is for Syria\u201d as they slaughtered innocent people.\n\nMany Americans, not all of them Republicans, can\u2019t understand Obama\u2019s reluctance to use the word \u201cIslamic\u201d in connection with these attacks\u2014even though \u201cIslamic\u201d is in ISIS\u2019s title. A clue to his stubbornness is that the president won\u2019t even say \u201cISIS.\u201d He insists of calling the group \u201cISIL,\u201d which was an early transliteration of the Arabic name for the group, but which it has since dropped. Obama pronounces this acronym \u201cIssel,\u201d as though it\u2019s less likely to give offense that way.\n\nHe continues to underestimate the group and its underlying ideology. In a CBS interview Wednesday, before San Bernardino became a killing ground, Obama said this: \u201cISIL will not pose an existential threat to us. They are a dangerous organization like al-Qaeda was, but we have hardened our defenses. The American people should feel confident that\u2026we are going to be able to defend ourselves and make sure that, you know, we have a good holiday and go about our lives.\u201d\n\nAfter the attacks, the president and his allies tried to shoehorn the facts into a gun control narrative. In one sense this was predictable; it\u2019s also jarring. The predictable part is that restricting access to firearms and ammunition is the public policy prescription that Obama and his party have embraced. Whatever your views on the Second Amendment, this approach was logical after Sandy Hook and some other mass shootings that have taken place during his White House tenure.\n\nIt made less sense after Chattanooga, where a self-radicalized jihadist immigrant with drug problems and mental health issues attacked U.S. military recruiting facilities, killing four United States Marines and a Navy sailor. At least one U.S. senator, Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, thought the moral of the story was that bans on active duty military being armed on such bases should be repealed.\n\nAnd the gun control argument seemed utterly out of place in the context of San Bernardino. A married couple devoted to ISIS, one of them a recent immigrant from Saudi Arabia, killed 14 co-workers of the husband, wounded 21 others, planted a remote-control pipe bomb designed to kill first responders, including medical personnel. They then tried to escape, apparently planning to use their arsenal\u2014including 12 more bombs\u2014elsewhere. If anything, these facts would make many Americans want to buy firearms, and look askance at Obama\u2019s plan to resettle refugees from the country where ISIS began.\n\nYet only the most anti-Obama partisan wouldn\u2019t have felt some sympathy for him when a weary-looking president addressed this issue in the White House on Thursday. It was the 18th time he\u2019d spoken about mass shootings in his 83 months in office. According to a National Journal tally, there have been 21 such incidents since he took office.\n\nThis country confronts a series of problems under the broad rubric of public safety: mass shootings, overseas-inspired Islamic terrorism, rapidly spiking everyday gun violence, and a spate of police brutality cases, disproportionately committed against people of color.\n\nIt\u2019s the president\u2019s responsibility to unpack these issues one at a time, communicate his ideas about them with the public, building political coalitions and consensus where he can. It may be impossible; perhaps the country (and the world) are simply ungovernable at this point in human history. But it\u2019s certainly not possible for a president to make progress if he doesn\u2019t try\u2014and if he isn\u2019t honest with himself or the public.
