When is he going to slam his fist on the desk, demand vengeance, put aside his incessant campaigning and call out the Islamic radicals of ISIS as the animals they are?\n\nInterrupted in the course of yet another photo-op on the benefits of ObamaCare, the president looked almost irritated Tuesday to be asked his reaction to the murder of the Jordanian pilot, shown on an Internet video being burned alive by ISIS.\n\nHe talked calmly about the \u201cbankrupt ideology\u201d of this \u201corganization,\u201d like he was addressing unhealthy menu choices at a fast food company. Where\u2019s his outrage?\n\nAt the least, we would expect Mr. Obama to be angry that his relentless pursuit of legacy goals is yet again likely to be sidetracked by pesky questions about his anti-terrorism strategy. Faced with yet another House vote to repeal ObamaCare, the president thought fit to host several families who apparently consider themselves beneficiaries of his legacy health care bill. Too bad; happy talk about health care probably won\u2019t be tomorrow\u2019s headlines.\n\nHe doesn\u2019t get it. No one doubts that many Americans are happy to be receiving free health care. It\u2019s the rest of the country \u2013 still the majority \u2013 who are unhappy that our policies cost more than they once did, that those same policies are not as generous as in the past, that we may no longer visit our favorite doctors or hospitals, that we may be fined if we don\u2019t sign up for insurance, that health care costs are still going up, that none of the supposed experiments in tort reform have surfaced \u2013 in short that we are now paying for those lucky enough to be on the receiving end of the country\u2019s largesse.\n\nMeanwhile, most Americans think the most serious threat facing the country is Islamic terrorism \u2013 not climate change, not income inequality \u2013 Islamic terrorism.\n\nA recent poll shows more Americans saying the United States is less safe from terrorists now than at any point since 9/11. We are concerned that our president does not share our alarm.\n\nRather, he appears desperate to sign a deal with Iran, he pretends that withdrawing our troops from Afghanistan and Iraq has made us safer, he proposes in his budget to actually cut back spending on our overseas anti-terrorism effort, he spurns Israel, and can\u2019t be bothered to show up in Paris when the world gathers to protest the savage murders at Charlie Hedbo.\n\nOnce again this past weekend, in an interview with Fareed Zakaria, President Obama said he doesn\u2019t \u201cquibble with labels,\u201d suggesting that the denouncement of Islamic terrorists was not an important declaration, but rather unnecessary nitpicking.\n\nHe made the case, once again, that we need to acknowledge that though ISIS is a \u201cparticular problem that has roots in Muslim communities,\u201d we harm our cause if we fail to recognize that most Muslims \u201creject this ideology.\u201d\n\nFair enough, but a case could be made that Muslims around the world are doing far too little to \u201creject\u201d extremism, a point recently made by New York\u2019s Cardinal Timothy Dolan. As he pointed out, during the \u201ctroubles\u201d in Northern Ireland, the Catholic Church would routinely condemn acts of IRA violence.\n\nWhere are the moderate Imams? Their silence is deafening.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.modified": "02-03-15", "dc.type": "Text.Article", "twitter": {"image": "http://nation.foxnews.com/sites/nation.foxnews.com/files/styles/story_624_300/public/Pilot3.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "dc.format": "text/html", "dc.publisher": "Fox News", "parsely-metadata": "{\"title\":\"ISIS Burns Jordanian Pilot: Mr. Obama, When Will You Get Angry About Radical Islam?\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/nation.foxnews.com\\/2015\\/02\\/03\\/isis-burns-jordanian-pilot-mr-obama-when-will-you-get-angry-about-radical-islam\",\"image_url\":\"http:\\/\\/nation.foxnews.com\\/sites\\/nation.foxnews.com\\/files\\/styles\\/story_624_300\\/public\\/Pilot3.jpg\",\"section\":\"nation\",\"author\":\"Fox News\",\"tags\":[],\"type\":\"article\",\"pub_date\":\"2015-02-03T21:28:17-05:00\",\"identifier\":\"72944\"}", "prism.aggregationType": "subsection", "description": "&amp;nbsp;By: Liz Peek (FOXNews.com)America wants to know, when is President Obama going to get angry?
