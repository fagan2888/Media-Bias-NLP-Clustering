The Southwest Regional Medical Center in Brown County closed its doors Friday afternoon with very little warning.

WLWT News 5 was told that employees were given no prior notice and were given two hours to get out.

The owner and CEO, Krishna Surapaneni, made the decision to close after a creditor obtained a court order to place liens against the hospital's main checking account, Roger Rieger, consulting chief operating officer told WLWT News 5.

The liens mean the hospital cannot make payroll.

Money problems at the hospital reportedly go back to 2010 when it was a county hospital.

WLWT is working to find out how many patients were at the hospital and what has happened with them.
