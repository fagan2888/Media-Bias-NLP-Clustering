The state’s largest insurer and a major hospital system have failed to find agreement in a contract set to expire June 1, the Orlando Sentinel reports (paywall alert).

Florida Blue plan members, including state of Florida employees and workers for Publix Super Markets, would have to find new health care providers or pay out-of-network fees if an agreement is not reached. Florida Blue declined to tell the Sentinel how many people could be affected.

Florida Blue is negotiating rates with all 23 Florida division hospitals and Adventist Health System physician groups, according to the Sentinel. The system spans from Ormond Beach on Florida’s east coast throughout Central Florida to the greater Tampa Bay area.
