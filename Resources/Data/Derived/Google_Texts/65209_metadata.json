Rand says that 8.2 million people have gained insurance from an employer since September \u2014 more than 7 million of them who had no health insurance before.\n\n\u201cWe see that of the 40.7 million who were uninsured in 2013, 14.5 million gained coverage, but 5.2 million lost coverage, for a net gain in coverage of approximately 9.3 million,\u201d the Rand report reads. Only about 1 million lost their private plans, and another 2 million lost employer-sponsored coverage.\n\nThe report adds to a growing number of studies trying to determine just what effect the 2010 Affordable Care Act is having on rates of health insurance in the U.S. The law is designed to start transforming the U.S. healthcare system in part by getting insurance to more people.\n\nMost Americans get their health coverage through an employer, and the law requires more employers to provide health insurance.\n\nTwo other reports published in the past week show the rate of people lacking health insurance has fallen to about 15 percent in recent months, and the Rand survey supports this.\n\nThe Obama administration says more than 7 million people have signed up for health insurance on the new, online exchanges. The Rand survey of 2,425 adults estimates a much lower number \u2014 3.6 million \u2014 but the researchers say their findings do not reflect everyone who may have signed up in the final days of open enrollment in March.\n\n\u201cAlthough a total of 3.9 million people enrolled in marketplace plans, only 1.4 million of these individuals were previously uninsured,\u201d Rand says in comments on its blog.\n\n\u201cMedicaid enrollment increased by 5.9 million,\u201d it adds. The Obama administration has only claimed 3 million.\n\nRand also estimates that fewer than 1 million people who had private health insurance lost their coverage when the plans were cancelled because they did not meet the new requirements of the law for providing minimum coverage. \u201cWhile the survey cannot tell if this latter group lost their insurance due to cancellation or because they simply felt the cost was too high, the overall number is very small, representing less than 1 percent of people between the ages of 18 and 64,\u201d the report reads.\n\n\"Urban, Gallup, and RAND all say the number of uninsured is declining since the ACA went into effect. Now we can debate why and by how much,\" the Kaiser Family Foundation\u2019s Larry Levitt said in a tweet.", "article_metadata": {"description": "More than 9 million Americans have health insurance for the first time thanks to Obamacare, a new report finds.", "og": {"url": "http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/obamacare-deadline/nine-million-got-new-health-insurance-study-finds-n74976", "type": "article", "image": "http://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2014_15/292266/140331-healthcare-montgomery-340p_241a6f13061919615217dc1d27362b1b.nbcnews-fp-1200-800.jpg", "site_name": "NBC News", "description": "More than 9 million Americans have health insurance for the first time thanks to Obamacare, a new report finds."}, "twitter": {"domain": "NBCNews.com", "description": "More than 9 million Americans have health insurance for the first time thanks to Obamacare, a new report finds.", "creator": "NBCNews", "image": {"src": "http://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2014_15/292266/140331-healthcare-montgomery-340p_241a6f13061919615217dc1d27362b1b.nbcnews-fp-1200-800.jpg"}, "title": "Nine Million Got New Health Insurance, Study Finds - NBC News", "site": "NBCNews", "card": "summary"}, "blitz": "mu-e1e842c9-946002e6-ea8f0454-41b29546", "DC.date.issued": "2014-04-08", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=319740707, app-argument=http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/obamacare-deadline/nine-million-got-new-health-insurance-study-finds-n74976", "fb": {"app_id": 10150138890205613}, "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/pages/Maggie-Fox/262695730411456"}, "google-site-verification": "K8bowvEbzWfPQ76x6f9SCxMVwicVXrhiClRg80ak8ZA", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Health,Health Care,Health news"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcebdb\"", "article_summary": "Most Americans get their health coverage through an employer, and the law requires more employers to provide health insurance.\nRand says that 8.2 million people have gained insurance from an employer since September \u2014 more than 7 million of them who had no health insurance before.\nOnly about 1 million lost their private plans, and another 2 million lost employer-sponsored coverage.\n\u201cWe see that of the 40.7 million who were uninsured in 2013, 14.5 million gained coverage, but 5.2 million lost coverage, for a net gain in coverage of approximately 9.3 million,\u201d the Rand report reads.\nThe Obama administration says more than 7 million people have signed up for health insurance on the new, online exchanges."}
