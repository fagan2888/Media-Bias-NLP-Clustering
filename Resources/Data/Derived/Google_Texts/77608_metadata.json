Perhaps this was its strategy all along, Cliff Gold, CoOportunity CEO and a former Wellmark marketing executive, told Healthcare Payer News.\n\nPrior to the ACA, Wellmark sold more than 80 percent of the individual plans in Iowa. It had more than a 60 percent share of the small group market and 78 percent of the large group market, according to HCPN. The insurer also sold the most off-exchange plans in both Iowa and South Dakota in 2014.\n\nNow, Wellmark is once again growing its business--and its profile. On Jan. 1, the insurer celebrated the opening of Des Moines' new $32 million Wellmark YMCA, so named because the insurer donated the land on which the facility was built, HPN reported.\n\nWellmark will most likely start selling on the public exchanges come 2016. Even if CoOportunity no longer sells plans in Iowa, Wellmark may see competition from Coventry. As a result, Wellmark intends to introduce new health plans and to improve support in this region.\n\nFor more:\n\n- here's the Healthcare Payer News story\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nState takes control of Iowa's CoOportunity Health plan over financial concerns\n\nIowa's CO-OP pulls out of marketplace despite first-year success\n\n5 secrets to exchange enrollment success: CoOportunity Health", "article_metadata": {"description": "Just seven days into 2015, Wellmark Blue Cross Blue Shield is already hoping to regain its dominance in Iowa and South Dakota.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthPayer", "description": "Just seven days into 2015, Wellmark Blue Cross Blue Shield is already hoping to regain its dominance in Iowa and South Dakota.", "title": "Wellmark looks to regain dominance in Iowa, South Dakota", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthpayer.com/story/wellmark-looks-regain-dominance-iowa-south-dakota/2015-01-07", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthpayer.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "healthpayer", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "keywords": "CoOportunity Health,Iowa,Operations & Business Management,Wellmark Blue Cross Blue Shield", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Operations & Business Management"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf8fc\"", "article_summary": "Just seven days into 2015, Wellmark Blue Cross Blue Shield is already hoping to regain its dominance in Iowa and South Dakota.\nFor more:- here's the Healthcare Payer News storyRelated Articles:State takes control of Iowa's CoOportunity Health plan over financial concernsIowa's CO-OP pulls out of marketplace despite first-year success5 secrets to exchange enrollment success: CoOportunity Health\nPrior to the ACA, Wellmark sold more than 80 percent of the individual plans in Iowa.\nThe insurer also sold the most off-exchange plans in both Iowa and South Dakota in 2014.\nEven if CoOportunity no longer sells plans in Iowa, Wellmark may see competition from Coventry."}
