The state Division of Insurance says consumers can expect to pay an increase of more than 30 percent on average for coverage.\n\nDownload Audio\n\nTwo insurers offer individual plans on the marketplace \u2013 Premera Alaska and Moda. Premera\u2019s plans will increase the most \u2013 an average of 37 percent. Premera spokesperson Eric Earling says even that increase is not enough to pay for customers\u2019 claims.\n\n\u201cWe do have a pretty clear influx of folks with some very significant medical costs that in the past was spread across the insured market, including employers,\u201d Earling said.\n\nEarling says the way the individual market is structured under the Affordable Care Act is not sustainable in a small population state like Alaska.\n\n\u201cBefore the ACA took effect in January, people could access coverage through a state high risk pool or through a state high risk pool,\u201d Earling said. \u201cMany of those folks are now purchasing coverage on the individual market and we believe Premera probably picked up a disproportionate share of those folks with really significant medical needs.\u201d\n\nPremera is working with the state on a solution that would spread the risk of those high cost customers across the insurance market. The state is analyzing the plan and hasn\u2019t yet taken a position on it.\n\nPremera serves 7,000 customers in the state who bought marketplace plans. Earling says the company expects to lose four million dollars insuring those customers this year. He says a small number of enrollees account for a huge amount of claims.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen since January first through June 30th, seven million dollars in medical claims from only 33 members out of those 7,000,\u201d Earling said. \u201cSo that\u2019s about 1/3 of all of our medical claims costs for those 7,000 members are coming from 33 individuals.\u201d\n\nEarling says Premera would have to increase rates by more that 70% next year to break even. That\u2019s the rate increase the company first proposed when it approached the state Division of Insurance, according to director Lori Wing-Heier. After looking at the company\u2019s data, she agreed with their financial assessment. But Wing-Heier says through discussions they were able to compromise on a lower rate increase:\n\n\u201cAnd we felt that they could sustain another year of significant loss,\u201d Wing-Heier said. \u201cThey\u2019re indicating they\u2019ll lose 5 million dollars in 2015 in addition to what they lost in 2014. But they are financially strong and they\u2019re willing to take that loss to see what the data looks like when we go through rate filling next year.\u201d\n\nModa, the other company offering individual plans on the marketplace, will increase rates by an average of 27 percent. Rates increase for both companies will vary depending on age and geographic region. Wing-Heier says state statute prohibits her from releasing the specific rates until they go into effect on January 1st. She says she hopes in a year or two, the rates will stabilize.\n\n\u201cWe are being asked through a federal program to price a product that some people cannot afford,\u201d Wing-Heier said. \u201cAnd we\u2019re doing the best we can to keep the cost of that product down.\u201d\n\nThe federal government points out that many Alaskans will be able to use subsidies, and that will help lessen the impact of the rate increases. In Alaska, almost 90 percent of consumers who bought plans on healthcare.gov in 2014 qualified for financial help to purchase the plans.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.alaskapublic.org/2014/09/05/huge-increase-for-healthcare-gov-insurance-rates-in-alaska/", "type": "article", "site_name": "Alaska Public Media", "description": "Alaskans who buy health insurance on the Affordable Care Act marketplace will see a significant rate hike for next year.
