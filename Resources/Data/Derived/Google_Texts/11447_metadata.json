Movable\u2019s fitness band product was competing with scores of other wearables. Blake Squires, Movable\u2019s CEO, thinks the company\u2019s software is better than that of its device competitors, though.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo now organizations using any device \u2013 including Garmin, Jawbone and Fitbit \u2013 can buy Movable\u2019s platform to manage wellness programs and track fitness goals, among other things.\n\nThe Movable software platform works this way: it has a front-end system that wearable users can operate, coupled with an \u201cAdmin Center\u201d that can be used by a manager to communicate with and set goals for everyone involved in, for example, a health challenge.\n\nAs Squires puts it, wearables are not one size fits all in terms of practical use. So having the option to use the company\u2019s platform on multiple devices is a benefit. Also with the growing market, it allows many people who already have various devices to still have the option to sync up.\n\n\u201cWe see the future as using our activity and program data to better inform interventions \u2013 whether simple wellness or complex disease management,\u201d Squires stated in the company\u2019s press release, which went out today.\n\n(Disclaimer: HATCH Partners, which invested in MedCity News, also invested in Movable)", "article_metadata": {"description": "Movable has partnered with Validic to expand its platform's reach to other wearable devices beyond its own model.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "MedCity News", "description": "Movable has partnered with Validic to expand its platform's reach to other wearable devices beyond its own model.", "title": "Wearable maker becomes a wearable software provider (industry shift?)", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://medcitynews.com/wp-content/uploads/Screen-Shot-2015-05-12-at-7.59.27-AM.png", "updated_time": "2015-05-12T12:42:35-04:00", "url": "http://medcitynews.com/2015/05/movable-inspiring-well-platform-designed-group-motivated-activity/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://medcitynews.com/wp-content/uploads/Screen-Shot-2015-05-12-at-7.59.27-AM.png", "description": "Movable has partnered with Validic to expand its platform's reach to other wearable devices beyond its own model.", "card": "summary", "title": "Wearable maker becomes a wearable software provider (industry shift?) - MedCity News"}, "fb": {"app_id": 148725768475669}, "google-site-verification": "xudQg7nxVR9ifmMTY4Tf-0wVtX9b6rWLQd0utCweGOc", "keywords": "weight loss, obesity, overweight,diabetes,massachusetts,medical devices,obesity,startups,healthcare innovation, medcity news,medcity news,san francisco, startups, life sciences,accelerator,rock health,startup advice,startup funding,patient monitoring system, motion sensors ,dc,healthcare it,washington,foodborne pathogens, diagnostics company, diagnostic platforms,minimally invasive surgery, laser surgery,cambridge,dealflow,hospitals,wellpoint, healthways, health and wellness, employee wellness programs,investing,wellness,medtronic, shanghai innovation center, china, r&d,china,mdt,minneapolis,minnesota,publics,twin cities,ulcerative colitis, abbott labs, humira,abbott labs,doctors,pharmaceuticals,skin disorders, pharmaceuticals, md anderson cancer center,cancer,texas,renal denervation, st. jude medical,st. jude medical,stj,emr, ehr, electronic health records, electronic medical records, certified emr,certified emr,ehr,electronic health records,electronic medical records,advanced cellular technology,amyotrophic lateral sclerosis,embryonic stem cells,geron corporation,lou gehrig\\'s disease,macular degeneration,regenerative medicine,spinal cord damage,value-based healthcare system, obamacare, fee-for-service model,california,cleveland,health insurance,insurance,ohio,pennsylvania,politics,cancer treatment options library, aetna, aet, healthcare it,aet,aetna,health it,phi,philadelphia,Cleveland, health IT, MOVABLE, Ohio, Wearables, , MedCity News", "article": {"section": "Daily", "tag": "Wearables", "published_time": "2015-05-12T09:55:52-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-05-12T12:42:35-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,width=device-width,user-scalable=no,minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Blake Squires, Movable\u2019s CEO, thinks the company\u2019s software is better than that of its device competitors, though.\nThe numbers tell the tale of how competitive the health wearables device space is.\nSo having the option to use the company\u2019s platform on multiple devices is a benefit.\nA wearable device company has shifted to being a platform for all wearables.\nMovable, which made its bones selling to schools and corporate wellness, announced today it\u2019s opening up its software platform so other wearables can plug in to its dashboard and back-end analytics."}
