The Obama administration has released a kind of price list for policies that will be sold on the 36 federally run health exchanges, when they open for enrollment on Tuesday.\n\nSome of the prices are eye-popping. Although the average premium for an individual is $328 a month, a 27-year old in Dallas who makes about $25,000 a year, could buy a lower level bronze plan for $74 a month.\n\nBut with insurance, as with many things, the premium is just the beginning.\n\n\u201cYou think you get a really sweet deal on health insurance,\u201d says Georgetown\u2019s Sabrina Corlette.\n\nBut the health-policy professor says what looks like a sweet deal, may not be. \u201cThe premium is just one dimension of your health insurance cost,\u201d she says.\n\nThere are also deductibles -- the amount you pay up front, before your coverage fully kicks in.\n\nAnd there are co-pays -- the $20 or $30 payments you have each time you see the doctor -- provided, of course, the one you need is in your network. Many of the policies could have fairly limited networks of providers and hospitals.\n\n\u201cIf you need to get specialty care that\u2019s outside of that network, you may have to pay more,\u201d says Corlette.\n\nPrescription costs, which may not be covered, can also be brutal.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s thousands of dollars to a consumer,\u201d says Dan Mendelson, CEO of Avalere Health which released a study today on out-of-pocket costs for policies offered on some of the exchanges.\n\nMendelson says it\u2019s quite possible people will wind up paying more for medication than for their monthly premiums.\n\n\u201cOur research has shown that patients who face these very high deductibles often abandon their prescriptions at the point of sale,\u201d he says.\n\nEven patients with cancer would skip their medication, says Mendelson, if they have to pay more than $500.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act does have annual spending caps of $6,400 for an individual, $12,800 for a family. And most of the policies on the exchange qualify for federal subsidies. But if you can\u2019t afford all the deductibles and co-pays, your insurance might not be worth much, no matter how cheap your monthly premium.", "article_metadata": {"csrf-param": "authenticity_token", "application-name": "Marketplace from APM", "og": {"url": "http://www.marketplace.org/2013/09/25/health-care/obamacare-premiums-what-price-leaves-out", "image": "http://cms.marketplace.org/sites/default/files/styles/primary-image-900x500/public/bloodpressurecheck.jpg?itok=Px-bYhLb", "type": "article", "description": "President Obama unveiled the premiums for his new health care plans.
