People need to do something,\u201d said Connie Cooley of Allen, who came with her rescue mutt, Chewbacca. \u201cWe can\u2019t allow for the least of us to be treated with such non-compassion.\u201d\n\nIn addition to planting the crosses, supporters, including Dallas Police Deputy Chief Paul Stokes and Deputy Mayor Pro Tem Erik Wilson, prayed in front of enlarged photographs of dead dogs.\n\n\u201cLove really is the goal here,\u201d said Pastor Becky Porter of the Heartland Church in Carrollton, who led a prayer. \u201cIt seems like humans forget about love, but dogs love easily and stubbornly.\u201d\n\nShe went on:\n\n\u201cLove is getting dirty while searching for the lost and forgotten.\u201d\n\n\u201cLove is standing up for animals who are being broken and dumped.\u201d\n\n\u201cLove is what you\u2019re doing today.\u201d\n\nAnimal-rights supporters began finding dumped dogs in the Dowdy Ferry area about a year and a half ago. The nonprofit Dallas DogRRR has saved about 135 dogs from Dowdy Ferry since then, its vice president said.\n\nBut activists have counted 91 dead animals found since they began keeping track last August \u2014 mostly dogs, but also cats, horses, cows, goats, deer and roosters.\n\nStephanie Timko, who helped organize Saturday\u2019s event, said animals end up at Dowdy Ferry for a variety of reasons: Some have been victims of animal cruelty and killed. Other are thrown off bridges and left for dead. Many are simply abandoned by negligent owners who don\u2019t want them anymore.\n\n\u201cThey sit by the roadside waiting for their owners to come back. They get more and more anxious and approach cars \u2014 and that\u2019s when they get hit,\u201d Timko said.\n\nStokes, who oversees the southeast patrol for the Dallas police, said police have installed cameras to catch dumpers. But he said education is key to stopping illegal dumping and curbing Dallas\u2019 loose-dog problem.\n\nOrganizers hoped Saturday\u2019s event would help. Volunteers fanned out into the neighborhood afterward, handing out fliers to raise awareness about how to report animal cruelty and dumping.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty impressive,\u201d Wilson, the deputy mayor pro tem, said of the efforts. \u201cIt\u2019s impactful.\u201d\n\nActivists announced that they plan to speak \u2014 with photos of dumped dogs in hand \u2014 at the Dallas City Council meeting Wednesday.\n\n\u201cI know we\u2019ll see you at City Council and I know the council is going to hear from you,\u201d Timko said as Chewbacca, who had been sitting quietly, let out a howl.\n\nThe group laughed and joined the dog with cheers.\n\nAnimal advocate Amy Cox came Saturday wearing a sweatshirt that said, \u201cRescue is my favorite breed\u201d and carrying a reusable shopping bag that featured dogs wearing glasses.\n\nShe said she\u2019s a frequent traveler who normally shows off her Texas accent \u201cloud and proud.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut, quite frankly, right now I\u2019m a little ashamed of my city and what we\u2019ve allowed to happen,\u201d she said.\n\nMany people who love animals, admiring the \u201cfluffy ones\u201d in pet stores, have no concept of the suffering that dogs endure daily in places like Dowdy Ferry Road, Cox said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not all cuteness \u2014 it\u2019s sadness in the animal world,\u201d she said. \u201cIf the citizens of this city had any concept of what was going on, I have no doubt they would come out to stop it.\u201d\n\nTwitter: @smervosh", "article_metadata": {"liveFyreID": "aHR0cDovL3RoZXNjb29wYmxvZy5kYWxsYXNuZXdzLmNvbS8yMDE2LzA0L2NydWVsLWRvZy1kdW1waW5nLW5lZWRzLXRvLXN0b3AtZGFsbGFzLWFjdGl2aXN0cy1zYXktYXQtc2F0dXJkYXktcmFsbHkuaHRtbC8=", "generator": "WordPress 3.9.12", "author": "Sarah Mervosh", "og": {"site_name": "The Scoop Blog", "description": "A line of white crosses stretches along Dowdy Ferry Road in southeast Dallas, past the junkyard of forgotten cars, past the bushy areas where dumped dogs go to die, all\u2026", "title": "Cruel dog dumping \u2018needs to stop,\u2019 Dallas activists say at Saturday rally", "url": "http://thescoopblog.dallasnews.com/2016/04/cruel-dog-dumping-needs-to-stop-dallas-activists-say-at-saturday-rally.html/", "image": "http://thescoopblog.dallasnews.com/files/2016/04/Dowdy-Ferry-memorial-1.jpeg", "type": "article"}, "LastModifiedDate": "2016-04-02T13:40:49Z", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image"}, "PublishDate": "2012-04-11T13:59:21Z", "wp-parsely_version": "1.7", "viewport": "width=device-width", "google-site-verification": "ZjZz-aaVcLkLDp8kIkLnEwtSTZlAwGgQhLyd1pXAbA8", "cXenseParse": {"recs": {"publishtime": "2012-04-11T13:59:21Z"}}}, "article_summary": "Volunteers erected the crosses in memoriam Saturday \u2014 91 for each of the dead animals found here since August.\n\u201cIt\u2019s impactful.\u201dActivists announced that they plan to speak \u2014 with photos of dumped dogs in hand \u2014 at the Dallas City Council meeting Wednesday.\nThe nonprofit Dallas DogRRR has saved about 135 dogs from Dowdy Ferry since then, its vice president said.\nThe largest cross of all, however, honored Marisol Espinosa, the once-missing Pleasant Grove mother whose remains animal activists found while searching for dumped dogs last month.\nBut activists have counted 91 dead animals found since they began keeping track last August \u2014 mostly dogs, but also cats, horses, cows, goats, deer and roosters."}
