Actor James Woods says he will be contributing to Carly Fiorina’s presidential bid as the narrator in her campaign film.

The actor tweeted that he was “proud to support this remarkable woman and her historic campaign” after the second GOP primary debate on Wednesday.

Fiorina drew rave reviews for her debate performance.

The Academy Award-nominated actor is an outspoken conservative. He has criticized Democratic primary front-runner Hillary Clinton, most recently after the former secretary of State's appearance earlier this month on "The Ellen DeGeneres Show."
