But their presence \u2014 in hearts, in memories \u2014 was felt as the young nation they never lived to enjoy made its World Cup debut, the 77th country to plant its flag on football\u2019s biggest stage.\n\n\u201cThis is why we came, to remember,\u201d Adnan Filipovic said as he filed into the stadium with his parents, his voice breaking with emotion. \u201cAll those people are coming with us to this game.\u201d\n\nWhen the 1992-1995 war made refugees of the Filipovics and so many others, never did they think they\u2019d one day see Bosnians teamed together, in Brazil of all places, giving two-time world champion Argentina and its superstar Lionel Messi a tough bone to chew.\n\nThe morning of Sunday\u2019s match, Filipovic prepared by looking at photos of the conflict on the Internet, to remind himself how far he and Bosnia have come and why this warm Rio de Janeiro night was such an important milestone. The conflict killed more than 100,000 people, turned half of the country\u2019s population of 4.3 million into refugees and left a legacy of poverty, high unemployment and never-ending political strife.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re all looking for some closure here. I think that\u2019s really what it is,\u201d said Filipovic, who was 11 when his family fled Banja Luka, in northern Bosnia, in 1994. They wound up in the United States, in Augusta, Georgia, and built a new life.\n\n\u201cIn these things there is never a winner, there is no \u2018victory.\u2019 I don\u2019t even know what victory is \u2014 until today. I know for our flag to be in Maracana is \u2014 I don\u2019t how else to define it \u2014 some kind of victory.\u201d\n\nFor a debut, Bosnia couldn\u2019t have asked for better: a marquee opponent in the World Cup\u2019s marquee stadium. The result \u2014 2-1 to Argentina \u2014 wasn\u2019t what Bosnians wanted, although, if they are honest, they probably feared worse.\n\nBosnia\u2019s scorer was Vedad Ibisevic. When Serb soldiers murdered his grandfather and burned down his father\u2019s village, his mother hid him and his sister in a fox-hole she dug in the woods. Ibisevic came on as a second-half substitute and planted his goal in the 85th minute.\n\nIbisevic was already a hero to Bosnians. His goal in a 1-0 win over Lithuania last October punched Bosnia\u2019s ticket to Brazil. Now he\u2019ll also forever be the first Bosnian to score a World Cup goal.\n\nEdin Dzeko, the striker Bosnians call their \u201cdiamond\u201d \u2014 forged under great pressure \u2014 wasted his best chance, sending his left-footed shot over the bar in the first half. Dzeko lived through the siege of Sarajevo, when Bosnian Serb forces shelled and fired on the city daily, killing over 11,000 people. He describes his early childhood as \u201cnothing but fighting, war and bullets.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Column: Bosnia writes new story at World Cup", "title": "Column: Bosnia writes new story at World Cup", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Column: Bosnia writes new story at World Cup", "title": "Column: Bosnia writes new story at World Cup", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/06/16/column_bosnia_writes_new_story_at_world_cup/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/06/brazil-soccer-wcup-argentina-bosnia.jpeg8-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Column: Bosnia writes new story at World Cup", "title": "Column: Bosnia writes new story at World Cup", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/06/brazil-soccer-wcup-argentina-bosnia.jpeg8-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "John Leicester", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Now he\u2019ll also forever be the first Bosnian to score a World Cup goal.\nI think that\u2019s really what it is,\u201d said Filipovic, who was 11 when his family fled Banja Luka, in northern Bosnia, in 1994.\n\u201cIn these things there is never a winner, there is no \u2018victory.\u2019 I don\u2019t even know what victory is \u2014 until today.\n\u201cThis is why we came, to remember,\u201d Adnan Filipovic said as he filed into the stadium with his parents, his voice breaking with emotion.\nBut their presence \u2014 in hearts, in memories \u2014 was felt as the young nation they never lived to enjoy made its World Cup debut, the 77th country to plant its flag on football\u2019s biggest stage."}
