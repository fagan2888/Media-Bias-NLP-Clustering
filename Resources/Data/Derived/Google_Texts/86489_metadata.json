It contains rice, soy powder, nutrients; dried vegetables. Putting the bags together is like an assembly line. It is fun for kids. Each table has a team number, and you compete as to how many you have bagged.\u201dShe said completed bags need only boiling water to cook.The Nov. 1 goal is to package 40,000 meals at a cost of 28 cents per meal.\u201cWhat happens is any given packaging group that does the packages decides where they want the food to go. In this case, the groups decided they wanted a lot to remain in Macomb County. They are going to give mostly to the Macomb Food Program,\u201d Greg Smith, treasurer of the Kids Against Hunger Utica Michigan Satellite, said.Scott Bischoff said that some of the food packages will assist St. Isidore Catholic Church\u2019s Rev.
