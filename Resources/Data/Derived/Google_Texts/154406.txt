ObamaCare doesn’t work is young Americans don’t “buy in”. But why would healthy adults in their 20s and 30s buy expensive insurance when it most cases they won’t need it?

On Thursday’s show, “Kelly from San Francisco”, an uninsured 26-year-old, said she thinks she shouldn’t be forced to buy health insurance! She told Tom she couldn’t afford it and said doesn’t need it.

However, when asked what she would do if she was “hit by a bus”, Kelly didn’t have an answer. This outraged some callers, including “Chelsea from Nebraska”.

“Chelsea” told Tom that people like “Kelly” are the very reason why ObamaCare’s mandate is necessary. “Chelsea” says buying health insurance is taking “personal responsibility” and taxpayers shouldn’t have to pay for people like “Kelly” when they get hit by a bus!
