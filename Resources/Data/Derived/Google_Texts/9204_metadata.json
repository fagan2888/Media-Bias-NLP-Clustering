Forget the R thing. This is an American issue,\" said Anaheim Mayor Tom Tait, a Republican and co-chair of the Immigration Reform Task Force, a bipartisan group within the United States Conference of Mayors.\n\nSince October, 52,000 unaccompanied children have arrived on the U.S. border with Mexico, the Department of Homeland Security said on Friday, underscoring an immigration problem seen by the White House as a humanitarian crisis.\n\nThe White House last week stepped up efforts to slow the flow of illegal children into the country, expanding the government's ability to process and deport people and announcing new funding to boost security in crime-plagued Central American countries.\n\nRepublicans blame the influx of children on President Barack Obama's 2012 decision to give temporary relief from deportation to some young people brought to the United States illegally by their parents.\n\nThe Obama administration's push for U.S. immigration reform has stalled in Congress amid partisan bickering.
