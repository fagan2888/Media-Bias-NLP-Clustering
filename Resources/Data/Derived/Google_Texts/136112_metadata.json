Regardless of a company\u2019s level of involvement, these programs have the same goals.\n\nErin Griffin, director of health and wellness at Memorial Hermann The Woodlands Hospital, said these programs not only aid in mitigating health care costs, but they have also been shown to reduce turnover and improve employee engagement.\n\n\u201cEmployee wellness programs are important for both the employee experience and the success of an organization,\u201d Griffin said. \u201cWhen a company invests in its employees\u2014their greatest asset\u2014they tend to lead healthier lifestyles, stay at their job longer and work harder when they are there.\u201d\n\nDuring her tenure in health care, Griffin said she has witnessed a shift from web-based wellness programs to more meaningful, interactive programs that produce better results. She said many company programs are taking wellness one step further by promoting emotional, communal and financial well-being.\n\n\u201cWhen companies implement effective health and well-being strategies, it impacts the entire community,\u201d Griffin said. \u201cMany employers recognize that community involvement leads to a greater sense of well-being, and having healthier, happier employees means that they\u2019ll have the energy to connect with their community in new and exciting ways.\u201d\n\nAnadarko Petroleum Corporation, headquartered in The Woodlands, is just one of the companies in the area with an employee wellness program. The organization has offered an on-site fitness center and medical clinics for employees at its Woodlands headquarters since the campus opened in 2003.\n\n\u201cBy providing programs like wellness to employees, you\u2019re not just making a financial investment for positive returns,\u201d said Scott Satterfield, director of global benefits for Anadarko. \u201cYou\u2019re also sending a message to employees: \u2018Hey, you\u2019re important enough that we are willing to invest in your health and well-being. We care about you.\u2019 That\u2019s a powerful message for employees to hear.\u201d\n\nGriffin said the Affordable Care Act was instrumental in the upward trend of corporate wellness programs.\n\n\u201dThe Affordable Care Act produced guidelines for employers seeking to implement certain health and wellness programs,\u201d Griffin said. \u201cThe guidelines have produced a buzz around employee wellness and encouraged more employers to join the conversation and consider implementing wellness strategies.\u201d\n\nGriffin said starting corporate wellness programs can be overwhelming. However, Memorial Hermann hosts quarterly employer advisory board meetings in The Woodlands where employers can seek information from professionals on where to begin.\n\n\u201cEmployers shouldn\u2019t wait until they have a significant budget to get started,\u201d Griffin said. \u201cStarting small can have significant impact on long-term sustainability and growth of an employee well-being strategy.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "msapplication-TileImage": "/favicon-144.png", "description": "May 11, 2016: In an effort to promote healthy living and cut health care costs, companies in The Woodlands are taking steps toward improving the health of their employee", "generator": "Powered by Visual Composer - drag and drop page builder for WordPress.", "og": {"site_name": "Community Impact Newspaper", "description": "May 11, 2016: In an effort to promote healthy living and cut health care costs, companies in The Woodlands are taking steps toward improving the health of their employee", "title": "Companies tapping wellness programs | Community Impact Newspaper", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://communityimpact.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/WDL-2016-05-27-2-700x309.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-05-11T12:17:55-05:00", "url": "https://communityimpact.com/houston/the-woodlands/healthcare/2016/05/11/companies-tapping-wellness-programs/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "May 11, 2016: In an effort to promote healthy living and cut health care costs, companies in The Woodlands are taking steps toward improving the health of their employee", "title": "Companies tapping wellness programs | Community Impact Newspaper", "image": "https://communityimpact.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/WDL-2016-05-27-1-A-460x693.jpg", "creator": "@impactnews", "site": "@impactnews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "robots": "noodp", "p": {"domain_verify": "586ad831859a33caa88da9358144e4cd"}, "fb": {"admins": 10203978947544147}, "theme-color": "#ffffff", "bitly-verification": "6bcd44a334c1", "keywords": "local, news, community impact, impact news, The Woodlands, business, city, county, dining, development, education, transportation, real estate, elections, nonprofit, guides, housing, health care, water, neighborhoods vote, employment, parks, recreation, arts, entertainment", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/CommunityImpact", "section": "The Woodlands", "tag": "The Woodlands May 2016", "published_time": "2016-05-11T09:47:42-05:00", "modified_time": "2016-05-11T12:17:55-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "anadarko petroleum corporation, corporate wellness programs, memorial hermann the woodlands hospital, the woodlands may 2016, local news, community impact, impact news"}, "article_summary": "Corporate wellness programs range from online programs and seminars to offering on-site fitness centers and medical clinics.\n\u201cThe guidelines have produced a buzz around employee wellness and encouraged more employers to join the conversation and consider implementing wellness strategies.\u201dGriffin said starting corporate wellness programs can be overwhelming.\n\u201cEmployee wellness programs are important for both the employee experience and the success of an organization,\u201d Griffin said.\n\u201dThe Affordable Care Act produced guidelines for employers seeking to implement certain health and wellness programs,\u201d Griffin said.\nIn an effort to promote healthy living and cut health care costs, companies in The Woodlands are taking steps toward improving the health of their employees by implementing wellness programs."}
