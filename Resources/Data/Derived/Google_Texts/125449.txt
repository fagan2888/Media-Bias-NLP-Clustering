Daniel Murphy was selected to his first All-Star game on Sunday. The former JU standout ranks second in the NL with 106 hits.

JACKSONVILLE - Former JU Dolphins standout Daniel Murphy has been named to his first MLB All-Star game, set for July 15 at Target Field.

Murphy, a second baseman for the New York Mets, ranks second in the National League with 106 hits as of July 7. He also ranks in the top 10 in the NL with 52 runs scored.

Murphy played three seasons at JU where he led the Dolphins to an NCAA Regional appearance. He was a 13th round selection in the 2006 MLB Draft.

"My immediate reaction would probably be shock," Murphy told MLB.com. "It's a blessing. I don't work any harder on this ballclub than anyone else does. There's no doubt about that. There's 24 men in here who work really hard. It's just an honor. It's humbling. It's a fantastic blessing."
