It\u2019s too crowded.\u201d That pearl of wisdom comes courtesy of Yogi Berra, the recently departed Yankee legend and master of malaprop. The reference was to some now-forgotten New York restaurant, but he might just as well have been speaking about urban planning.\n\nWe could take his paradoxical maxim and apply it to certain Dallas neighborhoods \u2014 Uptown, in particular. By Dallas standards, it is pedestrian-friendly and human in scale, but lately the pace of development, almost all of it undistinguished, has become so intense that whatever character it once had is being lost. In other parts of the city, despite a desperation for investment, the concerned are looking toward its bro-filled bars and shivering.\n\nFirst on that list is Bishop Arts, the Oak Cliff enclave in the midst of a gentrification that is only accelerating, with an attendant loss of that nebulous quality known as \u201cauthenticity.\u201d At the end of July, the mom-and-pop ice cream shop La Original Michoacana shut its doors, and this past week, the restaurateur Jay Jerrier announced he would be closing his pizza parlor, Zoli\u2019s, and moving it elsewhere. Its billboard read: \u201cFuture home of Bishop Arts Spray Tan and Manscaping.\u201d\n\nIt would be funny if it weren\u2019t so close to the truth. But Zoli\u2019s is departing to make way for one of two massive developments that will soon rise in the area. The first, from the developer Alamo Manhattan, made its second appearance before the city\u2019s Urban Design Peer Review panel last week, having already been sent back to the drawing board once, rejected as out of scale and incommensurate with the neighborhood. Within Bishop Arts, it had been welcomed with all the enthusiasm of Obamacare at a tea party rally.\n\nWith good reason. That initial scheme, produced for the developer by the architects Good Fulton & Farrell, was nothing more than a three-dimensional maximization of zoning allowances, an attempt to wring as much short-term profit as possible from the site without concern for its long-term impact. That\u2019s the Uptown way: stack \u2019em and pack \u2019em.\n\nCredit Alamo Manhattan for taking its plans back and making an honest effort to work with the neighborhood. The second attempt does a better job of engaging the street, and its hodgepodge loft aesthetic at least mitigates the scale of the project.\n\nOverall, however, it is timid and lacking in imagination, a surrender to some banal idea of historical contextualism instead of a creative response to the site and its opportunities.\n\nIf you\u2019re thinking, hey, it\u2019s a private development, how they build it is their business, you might consider that the shaping of public space is something in which every citizen has a stake and that this project, like so many others in this city, is subsidized through tax increment financing (TIF) dollars. Which is to say, it is effectively being built with your money.\n\nAnother TIF-funded development in the area, the 42-acre Bishop Arts Village, is far more impressive in both its planning and aesthetics.\n\nDesigned by Gensler for the Nazerian family, it is respective of the scale of neighboring buildings but is decidedly modern and unfussy in its execution. Acting as something of a link between West Davis and Jefferson Boulevard, it will offer both retail spaces and introduce open public areas \u2014 spaces that a more short-sighted builder might have built out to maximize density. The effect here will, instead, serve the community for the long term, thereby only reinforcing its own value.\n\nThat suggests another reason for concern. Both the Alamo Manhattan and Nazerian projects, as a condition of their TIF funding, reserve 20 percent of their units as affordable housing. But those numbers are relatively small, and it is reasonable to worry about the gentrifying effect of such projects, both in Oak Cliff and other parts of the city, in particular nearby West Dallas: an escalation in land values that displaces indigenous families while stripping neighborhoods of character, both architectural and otherwise.\n\nProperly controlled, gentrification need not be evil. Rising land values can be a benefit to minority populations, just so long as there are protections for low-income renters and against draconian tax assessment increases. Meanwhile, far greater emphasis must be placed on the rehabilitation of neighborhoods before \u201csettlers\u201d arrive, as the city\u2019s ambitious Neighborhood Plus plan promises to do.\n\nIf Dallas wishes to become a more diverse and integrated city, gentrification is a process the city will need to manage, like it or not.\n\nThe alternative, as Yogi would have it, is \u201cd\u00e9j\u00e0 vu all over again.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Good gentrification requires guidance.", "og": {"description": "Good gentrification requires guidance.", "title": "Killed by success: Too much of a good thing can ruin a city", "url": "http://www.dallasnews.com/lifestyles/arts/columnists/mark-lamster/20151003-killed-by-success-too-much-of-a-good-thing-can-ruin-a-city.ece", "image": {"width": 1280, "identifier": "http://www.dallasnews.com/lifestyles/arts/columnists/mark-lamster/20151003-nm_07walkable.ece/BINARY/original/NM_07Walkable", "height": 1208}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "type": "article"}, "LastModifiedDate": "2015-10-03T17:47:51Z", "twitter": {"site": "@dallasnews", "card": "summary", "creator": "@dallasnews"}, "PublishDate": "2015-10-03T16:37:54Z", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Killed by success: Too much of a good thing can ruin a city\", \"link\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/lifestyles/arts/columnists/mark-lamster/20151003-killed-by-success-too-much-of-a-good-thing-can-ruin-a-city.ece\", \"image_url\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/lifestyles/arts/columnists/mark-lamster/20151003-mad_dash_1.ece/BINARY/original/MAD_DASH_1\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"2463555\", \"pub_date\": \"2015-10-03T16:37:54Z\", \"section\": \"Mark Lamster\", \"author\": \"Mark Lamster\", \"tags\": [\"dallas\", \"dallas fort worth\", \"dallas news\", \"dallas fort worth news\", \"dfw news\", \"dallas local news\", \"dallas fort worth local news\", \"dallas newspaper\", \"dallas morning news\", \"dallas morning news newspaper\"]}", "fb": {"admins": 1043783589, "page_id": 20946638799, "app_id": 258290334265148}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "cXenseParse": {"recs": {"image": "http://www.dallasnews.com/lifestyles/arts/columnists/mark-lamster/20151003-mad_dash_1.ece/ALTERNATES/w660/MAD_DASH_1", "publishtime": "2015-10-03T16:37:54Z"}}, "news_keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd037b\"", "article_summary": "If Dallas wishes to become a more diverse and integrated city, gentrification is a process the city will need to manage, like it or not.\nWe could take his paradoxical maxim and apply it to certain Dallas neighborhoods \u2014 Uptown, in particular.\nWithin Bishop Arts, it had been welcomed with all the enthusiasm of Obamacare at a tea party rally.\nIts billboard read: \u201cFuture home of Bishop Arts Spray Tan and Manscaping.\u201dIt would be funny if it weren\u2019t so close to the truth.\nAnother TIF-funded development in the area, the 42-acre Bishop Arts Village, is far more impressive in both its planning and aesthetics."}
