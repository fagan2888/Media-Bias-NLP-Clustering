But it\u2019s a friendship that comes at the expense of real people\u2019s jobs.\n\nFast-food giant McDonald\u2019s has joined the trend of going to automation: Robots and computers can take and serve orders, but don\u2019t get minimum-wage hikes. They don\u2019t need Obamacare. They don\u2019t join union-organized protesters clamoring for $15 an hour. They don\u2019t argue with the boss. They don\u2019t come in late or miss work. And they make fewer mistakes.\n\nUnlike some human workers at the counter, computers are guaranteed to know English, as well as other languages, if need be.\n\nMachines will work more than 29 hours a week without incurring the $2,000- to $5,000-per-worker cost of Obamacare (plus rate hikes on the way that go up to 80 percent). The expenses of occasional maintenance and repairs are cheaper.\n\nAutomation was trending up already, but now it\u2019s skyrocketing from the nudges provided by Mr. Obama and his fellow liberals. The trend is hastened by Obamacare, by union-sponsored protests for a $15-an-hour minimum wage, by the left\u2019s success in enacting minimum-wage laws at the local level, and by the avalanche of regulations with their red tape, fines and penalties.\n\nSeattle has adopted the $15-an-hour minimum standard, more than doubling the federal $7.25 minimum wage. A study done for the city found worker pay on average is increased by 41 percent when these local laws are fully phased in. Other communities enacting such laws include Washington, D.C.; Albuquerque, New Mexico; San Francisco; and Montgomery and Prince George\u2019s counties in Maryland. Many more such statutes are in the pipeline.\n\nNow, McDonald\u2019s officials announce that they\u2019re going to use machines, not people, to take orders at thousands of locations. The trend toward order-taking computer tablets and kiosks is also underway at White Castle, Taco Bell, Chili\u2019s, Applebee\u2019s, Panera Bread, Burger King, Subway, Arby\u2019s and other major chains. Human workers are also bypassed by smartphone apps that take advance or delivery orders at Taco Bell, Chipotle, Pizza Hut, Domino\u2019s and plenty more. Jimmy John\u2019s has launched a major national ad campaign to promote its sandwich-ordering app.\n\nLowe\u2019s Home Improvement hardware stores just announced the installation of robot store workers. The whole inventory is in the robots\u2019 database. If you need a certain size and thread of screw, just hold it up to the robot\u2019s scanner, and it will find the match. Then it escorts you to the aisle and bin where you can find it.\n\nEvery time government \u201cprotects\u201d workers, it makes labor more expensive. That\u2019s music to the ears of companies that sell the machines and the software.\n\nThose protesting for higher pay without higher productivity should get off the picket lines and use the time to improve their job skills. Perhaps they should prepare for jobs in automation services.\n\nIt\u2019s not just taking orders. Tasks like flipping burgers are being automated, too. Warehouses are filled with robots that retrieve and fill orders, replacing stock clerks.\n\nEver since the Industrial Revolution began, the trend has been to replace human (and animal) labor with machine labor. Horses gave way to horseless carriages, which in turn may give way to robot-controlled automobiles. ATMs replaced many bank clerks. Machines are replacing clerks at store checkout lines.\n\nBut today\u2019s change is not simply based on technology. It\u2019s based on government policies that make human labor ever more expensive. In addition to Obamacare and minimum wages, there are thick volumes of regulations on worker safety through OSHA; wage, hour and overtime dictates from the Labor Department; and other mandates such as the Americans with Disability Act.\n\nAutomation not only holds down consumer prices by restraining costs, but also bypasses regulations and bureaucracy. That\u2019s valuable to any business that faces a tangled thicket of regulations from federal, state and local bureaucrats.\n\nWhy the rise of the machines? Because government is putting humans at a disadvantage. The policies of Barack Obama are the robots\u2019 best friend.\n\n\u2981 Ernest Istook is a former Republican congressman from Oklahoma.
