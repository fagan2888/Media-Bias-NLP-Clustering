Rather, the goal is that Moscow\u2019s pilots \"maintain safe distance.\u201d\n\nThe agreement, the text of which will remain secret at Russia\u2019 request, is the culmination of a series of \u201cdeconfliction\u201d talks between the U.S. and Russia military officials after Moscow began a bombing campaign on Sept. 30. In recent days, Russian pilots have flown close to U.S. jets and drones over Syria.\n\nMeanwhile, the U.S. is deploying the A-10 Thunderbolt II attack jet to neighboring Turkey.\n\nA dozen planes arrived at Incirlik Air Base in the southern part of the country over the weekend. The installation has become major hub for the anti-ISIS coalition effort, with the U.S. flying F-16 fighter jets and other aircraft from the site against Islamic State targets inside Syria.\n\nRelated: Here's Why Obama Is Refusing to Meet with Russia to Discuss Syria\n\nThe A-10, known as the \u201cWarthog,\u201d adds a new element to the U.S. presence. The jet can loiter over the battlefield and provide support to ground forces. It\u2019s especially known for its anti-tank capabilities.\n\nCook said the deployment was part of a regular planned rotation and that he didn\u2019t know if the Warthog would fly sorties into Syria, a country that still has substantial anti-aircraft defenses.\n\nHowever, there is the distinct possibility that the A-10 could fly missions against extremists on the ground Syria, especially after the Obama administration ended its effort to train moderate Syrian rebels to fight ISIS, switching to a program of support for indigenous groups already on the ground the region, backed by U.S. airpower.\n\nRelated: Eyeing Russia, the Air Force Sends More A-10 Warthogs to Europe\n\nLast week Cook himself suggested the Pentagon was figuring how best to support rebel troops.\n\n\u201cThis is an effort where we are providing support to rebels on the ground in Syria. We are providing air support \u2026 and we will continue to provide that support ongoing,\u201d he said during a press briefing.\n\nIf the A-10 does venture into Syria, it likely would further cloud an already murky picture on the ground, regardless of the newly-minted compact between Washington and Moscow. The administration is already supplying anti-tank weapons to rebel forces to fight the regime\u2019s forces; adding the A-10 to the mix would deepen U.S. involvement in the years-long conflict and boost critics who argue that Washington, despite President Obama\u2019s protestations to the contrary, is getting sucked into a proxy war with Moscow.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The United States and Russia just struck a deal to establish safety protocols aimed at reducing the risk to their aircraft as they carry out separate air campaigns in Syria.
