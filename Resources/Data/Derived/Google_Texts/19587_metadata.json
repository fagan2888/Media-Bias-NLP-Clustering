Data provided to attendees during this quality care session demonstrated how the method of scorecarding physicians remarkably improves outcomes while simultaneously lowering overall costs.\n\nHarbor Health Systems, a One Call Care Management company, participated in the Center for Excellence breakout session, providing insights about the quality care movement in workers\u2019 compensation, August 26th at the 70th Annual Workers\u2019 Compensation Educational Conference in Orlando, Florida.\n\nThe panel conversation uncovered a great need among workers\u2019 compensation professionals to shift their focus toward getting injured workers to the best doctors available, as opposed to being primarily focused on discounts and network penetration.\n\n\u201cAt this Center for Excellence discussion, we discussed provider scorecarding and the importance of getting injured workers to the best doctors, not only so they can return to work, but because of the immense financial implications inherent when someone sees a five-star doctor versus a one-star doctor. It\u2019s critical for workers\u2019 compensation professionals to become advocates for injured workers and focus on patient engagement for this outcomes-based model to be successful,\u201d said Gregory Moore, MPH, Senior Vice President of Innovation for One Call.\n\nPanelists brought the conversation back to the healthcare reform changes of late, noting that successful outcomes-based programs are evolving to pay-for-performance models and risk-sharing, which are in line with changes coming as a result of the ACA.\n\nParticipants in this session included:\n\nKimberly George, Senior Vice President, Corporate Development, M&A and Healthcare at Sedgwick Claims Management Services, Inc.\n\nMark Walls, Vice President, Communications and Strategic Analysis at Safety National\n\nJacob Lazarovic, M.D., Chief Medical Officer at Broadspire\n\nTo learn more about how utilizing outcomes-based networks can help lower overall claims costs, contact Greg Moore at (949) 273-7023, gmoore@harborsys.com.\n\nFollow Harbor Health Systems on social media for updates on the workers\u2019 compensation claims industry in California along with MPN updates: Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn and Google+.\n\nAbout Harbor Health Systems\n\nHarbor Health Systems, a One Call Care Management company based in Irvine, Calif., leads a revolution in medical networks that allows customers to build and manage a medical system based on quality performance of providers rather than the \u201clowest bidder medicine\u201d that is typical of PPOs and HMOs.
