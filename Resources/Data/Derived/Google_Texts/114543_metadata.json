(Photo by Sean Logan)\n\nASU Student Health Insurance is now offering prescription coverage as a benefit for students insured under Aetna Student Health Insurance.\n\nMost students have the ability to enroll in medical insurance provided by the University.\n\nThe new benefit of prescription coverage will include birth control and smoking cessation products, Insurance Manager for ASU Health Services Karen Hagerman said.\n\n\u201cThe student plan is a very comprehensive plan with low out-of-pocket costs,\u201d Hagerman said.\n\nShe said there has been an increase in enrollment in ASU health coverage the last couple of years.\n\nHagerman said it is difficult with the Affordable Care Act to determine exactly what has caused their increased enrollment over the last couple of years, but she hopes the prescription benefits adds to this increase.\n\nStudents trying to enroll in the ASU student health insurance plan must enroll prior to enrollment deadlines, which is the end of the second week of classes.\n\nEnglish sophomore Shandiin Ramsey said prescription coverage would be beneficial to many students that have health insurance through the University.\n\n\u201cI liked ASU\u2019s student health insurance when I had it, but I am now under my parents,\u201d Ramsey said. \u201cI wish I could have had the prescription coverage last year, though; it would have been helpful sometimes.\u201d\n\nLandscape architecture sophomore Majed Bushnag said international students are required to have the ASU student health insurance.\n\nBushnag said he appreciates being enrolled in the health insurance, because he expects to pay little to nothing for the medication he has to take.\n\n\u201cHaving to refill on your medication can be expensive sometimes,\u201d he said. \u201cHopefully this new benefit will help me save some money.\u201d\n\nWith ASU Health Services, there are four convenient locations that are available. The Tempe, Downtown Phoenix, Polytechnic, and West campuses all have an ASU health services building.\n\nHealth services offers more than 20 certified physicians and nurse practitioners. All locations have an on-site pharmacy and lab services available for the students.\n\nCommunications sophomore Zach Lytle said he really likes the ASU student health insurance and has been enrolled since freshman year. He said he has no intentions of using the prescription coverage but is very happy with ASU Health Services.\n\n\u201cIt is nice knowing that if you are sick or not feeling well that you can simply walk to the location closest to you and get help,\u201d said Lytle. \u201cNot many colleges offer that.\u201d\n\nCorrection: Due to a reporting error, a previous version of this article incorrectly stated which of ASU Health Services facilities offer X-rays to those who need them.
