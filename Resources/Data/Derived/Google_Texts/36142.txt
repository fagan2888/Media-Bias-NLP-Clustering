In an appearance on NBC’s Meet the Press, host Chuck Todd remarked that Abbott was likely to be “a popular figure inside the Republican Party,” and asked him about the numerous rumored 2016 Republican Presidential candidates with a Texas connection — outgoing Governor Rick Perry, Senator Ted Cruz, Senator Rand Paul, who was born in Texas, and Jeb Bush, whose son, George P. Bush, was just elected last month as Texas’ next Land Commissioner. “Do you have a favorite?” asked Todd.

“I will be strongly supportive of the Republican nominee to be the next President of the United States,” said Abbott with a grin.

“You are staying out of the primary totally?” asked Todd. “I’m staying out of the primary,” confirmed Abbott.
