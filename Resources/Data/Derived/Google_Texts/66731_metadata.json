CIA DE FOTO, CC BY 2.0\n\nA good night\u2019s sleep, experts say, consists of eight hours of rest, a cool room about 65 degrees \u2014 and for some women, a \u201csleep-gasm.\u201d Waking up pleasantly flushed by the intense pleasure of an orgasm for women is not a myth. Wet dreams are not just a guy thing; women can experience several sleep-gasms in one night and, unfortunately, not even know it.\n\nDuring the REM stage of sleep, the body begins to periodically engorge the genital region with blood, just as if you were aroused. The increase in blood flow can peak and release, which results in a penis erection for males and vaginal secretions in females. However, this does not necessarily indicate that the sleeper is experiencing a sexual dream.\n\nIn women, blood flow to the genitals increases anywhere from a little during REM sleep to about as much as when women masturbate or watch erotic films. This suggests REM-induced genital arousal is similar to waking sexual arousal. Some women even wake up from deep sleep to find themselves sexually stimulated or just having experienced a sleep-gasm.\n\nThe female wet dream has been seldom studied because it\u2019s difficult to identify, since women\u2019s organs are on the inside. Men, on the other hand, possess \u201cejaculatory evidence\u201d when they have a wet dream, whereas vaginal secretions in women could be a sign of sexual arousal without orgasm.\n\nA study published in the Journal of Sex Research found that 85 percent of women had experienced nocturnal orgasms by the age of 21, while some before they turned 13. A female nocturnal orgasm occurs only when sexual arousal during sleep awakens the sleeper to perceive the orgasm. Women who do have these orgasms during sleep are susceptible to having them several times a year.\n\nGirls and women who don\u2019t know whether or not they\u2019ve had orgasms in their sleep are not alone. Lifetime\u2019s YouTube channel\u2019s installment of Street Doctors \u201cDo Women Have Wet Dreams\u201d found most women were not sure about the existence of a sleep-gasm. Dr. Ross I. Donaldson says in the video, \"It's normal for both sexes to have dreams of an erotic nature, and frequently that does lead to orgasm or ejaculation. ... But it's totally natural.\"", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "wet, dreams, arent, just, men, lubricated, vagina, increases, likelihood, sleep, gasms", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "\u201cSleep-gasms\u201d are a common occurrence in women but are often missed because of a lack of telltale signs.", "title": "Do Women Have Wet Dreams Too?
