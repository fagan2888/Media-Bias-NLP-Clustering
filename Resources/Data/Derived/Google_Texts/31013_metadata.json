Terry McAuliffe, who is dealing with similar issues and vowed to contact the White House for assistance.\n\nThe mayor also has a meeting Monday on Capitol Hill with North Carolina Rep. G.K. Butterfield and is tentatively scheduled to meet with fellow Democratic Reps. David Price, N.C., and Hank Johnson, Ga.\n\nO\u2019Neal\u2019s argument that expanding Medicaid under ObamaCare could have prevented the hospital's closure puts him at odds with Republican leaders, considering North Carolina and 23 other states, all GOP-controlled and mostly southern, have refused Medicaid expansion.\n\nA busload of Belhaven residents are also expected to arrive on Capitol Hill on Monday to talk to members of Congress and their staffers about the issue.", "article_metadata": {"classification": "/FOX NEWS/POLITICS/REGULATION/Health Care", "dcterms.modified": "2015-01-31
