The current study is the first to look at osteoporosis as a risk factor in Asian patients, according to its authors.\n\n\u201cIn our clinical practice, we encountered many osteoporotic patients in outpatient clinics and some of them complained of hearing problems, so we started to research the associated studies and papers,\u201d senior author Dr. Kai-Jen Tien told Reuters Health in an email.\n\n\u201cAccording to previous reports, there seems to be a causal relationship but the risk relationship between these two diseases was not clear,\u201d said Tien, an endocrinologist at the Chi Mei Medical Center in Tainan.\n\nFor the study, published in the Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism, Tien\u2019s team analyzed data from health insurance claims for nearly all residents of Taiwan.\n\nThey compared 10,660 people who were diagnosed with osteoporosis between 1998 and 2008 to 31,980 randomly selected patients who were similar, but without osteoporosis.\n\nThe researchers followed all the patients through 2011 and found that 91 of those with osteoporosis were diagnosed with sudden deafness compared to 155 patients from the much larger control group.\n\nThat translated to a sudden deafness rate of about 10 people in 10,000 per year with osteoporosis versus about 6 per 10,000 per year without osteoporosis.\n\n\u201cThe main results found an approximately 1.76-fold increase in the incidence of (sudden sensorineural hearing loss) for patients with osteoporosis compared with the comparison group,\u201d Tien said.\n\nIn addition, Tien noted, patients with more severe osteoporosis may have a higher risk of sudden deafness than patients with milder bone disease.\n\n\u201cOur study cannot answer if early detection and treatment (of osteoporosis) can reduce the risk of sensorineaural hearing loss,\u201d Tien said. \u201cFurther prospective and intervention study should be done to resolve the question.\u201d\n\nMore research is also needed to understand what the connection might be between bone disease and hearing loss.\n\nTien said doctors should not ignore hearing problems in osteoporotic patients, and osteoporotic patients should seek help early if they suffer from suspected hearing impairment.\n\nDr. Steven Rauch, medical director at the Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary in Boston, praised the study\u2019s \u201creally solid\u201d methodology, but noted that \u201cthe incidence of sudden hearing loss in all of their study is five to ten times higher than has ever been reported in Western Europe or the United States.\u201d\n\nAnd, the difference in risk between the two study groups (4 people per 10,000 per year) was really quite small, said Rauch, who wasn\u2019t involved in the study.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re little numbers and it doesn\u2019t really shed any light on our basic understanding of sudden hearing loss,\u201d he said.\n\nRauch said he also found it interesting that the patients who were treated for osteoporosis had a higher incidence of hearing loss than those whose osteoporosis was untreated.\n\nThere are many reasons for sudden hearing loss and doctors are not always sure of the cause, Rauch said, but he emphasized that sudden hearing loss is an emergency.\n\n\u201cThere is a short time window, no more than two to four weeks, during which you can treat it with steroids,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you treat it within the first couple of weeks, about 75 percent of patients get some of their hearing back, but if you miss that window it\u2019s too late.\u201d\n\nOne problem, he added, is that sudden hearing loss can feel just the same as a head cold, or an ear plugged on an airplane or earwax blockage. So it\u2019s not a scary symptom, and diagnosis is often delayed beyond the point where treatment is helpful.\n\nRauch described a simple test for patients who have a sudden blockage of the ear.\n\n\u201cYou hum - if you hear your own voice amplified in the blocked ear, there\u2019s nothing to worry about, it\u2019s probably ear wax or fluid,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you hear your voice amplified in the good ear, that\u2019s an emergency.\u201d\n\nSOURCE: http://bit.ly/1GUJfuP Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism, online April 16, 2015.\n\n(By Shereen Lehman)", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "osteoporosis, linked, higher, risk, sudden, deafness", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "People with osteoporosis may be almost twice as likely to develop sudden hearing loss, a new study found.", "title": "Osteoporosis Linked To Higher Risk Of Sudden Deafness", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/osteoporosis-linked-higher-risk-sudden-deafness-332590", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/05/08/deafness.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "People with osteoporosis may be almost twice as likely to develop sudden hearing loss, a new study found.", "title": "Osteoporosis Linked To Higher Risk Of Sudden Deafness", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/osteoporosis-linked-higher-risk-sudden-deafness-332590", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/05/08/deafness.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/05/08/deafness.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2015-05-08T16:55:39-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-05-08T16:55:53-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "People with osteoporosis may be almost twice as likely to develop sudden hearing loss, a new study found."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0c3e\"", "article_summary": "There are many reasons for sudden hearing loss and doctors are not always sure of the cause, Rauch said, but he emphasized that sudden hearing loss is an emergency.\nIn addition, Tien noted, patients with more severe osteoporosis may have a higher risk of sudden deafness than patients with milder bone disease.\n\u201cThey\u2019re little numbers and it doesn\u2019t really shed any light on our basic understanding of sudden hearing loss,\u201d he said.\nPeople with osteoporosis may be almost twice as likely to develop sudden hearing loss, a new study found.\n\u201cOur study cannot answer if early detection and treatment (of osteoporosis) can reduce the risk of sensorineaural hearing loss,\u201d Tien said."}
