Adelaide has said it could give Austin a piece of Aboriginal art in return for the opal.

Plotting to give an expensive piece of jewelry isn’t unusual this time of the year. But the plans typically don’t involve the Austin City Council.

The council Thursday will consider a resolution, introduced by Council Member Leslie Pool, that invites Australian sister city Adelaide to visit Austin for “an in-person ceremony” and exchange of gifts.

Austin would return a large opal brooch it received from Adelaide in 1983. Adelaide, which defied the rules of gift-giving etiquette earlier this year by asking for the opal back, has said it could give Austin a piece of Aboriginal art in return.

“We will be sending back one item that’s real important to them and receiving another … cultural artifact from them in return,” Pool said during Tuesday’s council work session.

The opal was commissioned decades ago as regalia for an Adelaide lady mayoress, but her successor thought the gem was bad luck and wanted to get rid of it. After the opal arrived in Austin, mayor’s wives used to wear the gem to formal events.

But for the past several years the opal, which an Australian news outlet reported to be worth tens of thousands of dollars, has been locked up in a bank vault. Adelaide’s newest lady mayoress became interested in the opal after researching her predecessors.

“It goes without saying that the Austin City Council resolution is a wonderful gesture that is appreciated by The City of Adelaide,” said a statement from Matt Halliwell, Adelaide’s senior media adviser. “The opal is of great historical significance to Adelaide and having it returned would mean a great deal to the city.”

A letter from Adelaide’s acting CEO said the city is celebrating its 175th anniversary and would put the opal on display.
