That\u2019s 94 percent of enrollments.\n\nThe Kaiser Foundation Health Plan received 3,560 new customers. Evergreen Health, a new cooperative that hoped to get thousands of customers via the exchange, had 525 sign-ups through the site. United Healthcare had 322.\n\nAll of those customers signed up during the first open enrollment period, from Oct. 1 to March 31. The state\u2019s Web site did not function as expected during that period, which made it much more difficult for many Marylanders to enroll.\n\nThe state is in the process of replacing its Web site before the next open enrollment period starts Nov. 15.\n\nOne of the flaws with the first site: For months, plans were listed based on premium price, putting lower-priced CareFirst plans at the top and forcing shoppers to extensively search if they wanted other options. Peter Beilenson, founder and president of Evergreen, has said that this flaw, along with the general dysfunction of Maryland\u2019s site, unfairly hurt his start-up and forced it to quickly change its business plan, targeting businesses instead of individuals. Beilenson hopes that once the state replaces its Web site with technology that has worked in Connecticut, consumers will be able to fully vet all of their choices, factoring in perks and costs beyond the monthly premium.\n\nFor the next open enrollment period, CareFirst has proposed increasing its premiums by 23 to 30 percent, a hefty increase that the Maryland Insurance Administration has yet to approve. Kaiser has proposed decreasing its rates by 12 percent, while Evergreen has proposed a decrease of 10 percent.\n\nSome other statistics recently released by Maryland health officials:\n\n\u2022 Of those who enrolled in private plans through the marketplace, 54 percent were women.\n\n\u2022 Montgomery County had 20,430 enrollments, the most in the state. (See a map of county-by-county results.)\n\n\u2022 Seventy percent of enrollees were older than 35 years old, and more than half were older than 45.\n\nHere\u2019s the breakdown provided by the exchange: Younger than 18, 2,199 sign-ups (3 percent); ages 18 to 25, 6,249 (8.7 percent); ages 26 to 34, 13,178 (18.3 percent); ages 35 to 44, 3,370 (18.5 percent); ages 45 to 54, 17,011 (23.6 percent); ages 55 to 64, 18,253 (25.3 percent); 65 and older, 1,947 (2.7 percent).\n\n\u2022 More than 70 percent of Marylanders opted for plans that cover more expenses.\n\nThe exchange ranks its plans on a metallic scale, with bronze plans having the most out-of-pocket expenses and platinum plans offering the fewest.\n\nAbout 28 percent of shoppers opted for bronze plans, while 53.6 percent went for silver plans, 12 percent picked gold plans and 5.5 percent signed up for platinum. The exchange also offered \u201ccatastrophic\u201d plans with limited flexibility, but only 429 people \u2014 less than 1 percent of shoppers \u2014 picked that option.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The insurance giant often had the lowest priced plans, but it has proposed increasing premiums.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/wpjennajohnson", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "The insurance giant often had the lowest priced plans, but it has proposed increasing premiums.", "title": "94 percent of Marylanders who got health insurance through the state\u2019s marketplace chose CareFirst", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/md-politics/94-percent-of-maryland-health-insurance-exchange-business-went-to-carefirst/2014/07/03/4370d574-02b5-11e4-8572-4b1b969b6322_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2014/02/27/Local-Politics/Images/Republicans_Health_Care-09dfb-529.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@wpjenna"}, "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "mdpolitics, md politics, maryland politics, obamacare, affordable care act, carefirst, maryland health insurance, maryland health exchange, evergreen, kaiser, united, peter beilenson, martin omalley", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/wpjennajohnson"}, "eomportal-uuid": "4370d574-02b5-11e4-8572-4b1b969b6322", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "mdpolitics, md politics, maryland politics, obamacare, affordable care act, carefirst, maryland health insurance, maryland health exchange, evergreen, kaiser, united, peter beilenson, martin omalley"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fccc4f\"", "article_summary": "For the next open enrollment period, CareFirst has proposed increasing its premiums by 23 to 30 percent, a hefty increase that the Maryland Insurance Administration has yet to approve.\nThe state is in the process of replacing its Web site before the next open enrollment period starts Nov. 15.\nThe Kaiser Foundation Health Plan received 3,560 new customers.\nEvergreen Health, a new cooperative that hoped to get thousands of customers via the exchange, had 525 sign-ups through the site.\nAll of those customers signed up during the first open enrollment period, from Oct. 1 to March 31."}
