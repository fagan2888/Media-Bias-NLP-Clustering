That\u2019s who he is. And we definitely saw that (Saturday), like we did (Friday).\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t just Winston\u2019s focus that was sharp on Day 2 of rookie minicamp. After turning in an erratic throwing performance on Day 1, Winston was more on point on Saturday.\n\nHe\u2019s also proving to be a quick study. Winston has only had about a week to examine the offensive playbook, but he\u2019s already impressing his new coaches with his knowledge of it.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s been cramming like it\u2019s the final exam, and he\u2019s doing a good job of it,\u201d Smith said. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen marked improvement from the moment we gave him his playbook. Jameis is a bright guy. He\u2019ll be able to get it all.\u201d\n\nReach out\n\nWhen the Bucs traded up four spots to select little-known Hobart College offensive lineman Ali Marpet with the 61st overall pick in the draft, they made history.\n\nThey also left a lot of fans wondering what they were doing.\n\nThe Bucs made the 6-foot-4, 307-pound Marpet the highest-drafted Division III player ever, but did they reach too far in grabbing the Hastings-on-Hudson, New York, native?\n\nIt seems not.\n\nA look back at scouting reports and mock drafts suggests the Bucs didn\u2019t reach at all.\n\nFor example, WalterFootball.com\u2019s second-round mock draft had Marpet going 63rd overall to Seattle, where one of WalterFootball\u2019s scouts said Marpet would be \u201ca great fit for the blocking scheme.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Sports Illustrated\u2019s second-round mock had Marpet going 64th overall to New England, where Don Banks wrote that the Patriots would be fortifying \u201ctheir offensive line with a prospect who plays in the tough, battling style they most admire from their grunts up front.\u2019\u2019\n\nAnd Bleacher Report, in its Day 2 mock, had Marpet going 72nd overall to the Rams, saying, \u201cMarpet presents value due to his versatility. The Division III product can compete to start at center or guard.\u201d\n\nStick around\n\nOf the 55 players attending rookie minicamp, 36 are doing so on a tryout basis. After two days of work, it looks like a couple of those getting tryouts might get the chance to stick around a little longer.\n\n\u201cThe process is still ongoing, so I can\u2019t really point anybody out (specifically) right now,\u201d Smith said Saturday. \u201cBut we like a couple of our tryout players, and in a few days, you\u2019ll see the ones we\u2019re talking about.\u201d\n\nFireballer\n\nWinston\u2019s arm strength is said to be one of his greatest assets. Some of his fellow rookies at minicamp are finding out the hard way just how strong of an arm he has.\n\n\u201cYou guys don\u2019t even know,\u201d wide receiver hopeful Kaelin Clay said when asked about Winston\u2019s throwing ability. \u201cHe threw one to me today and it ripped my glove. He has some power behind that arm.\u201d\n\nrcummings@tampatrib.com\n\n(813) 259-7979\n\nTwitter: @RCummingsTBO", "article_metadata": {"taboola-pub-time": "Sun, 10 May 2015 01:00:00 -0400", "Description": "If Buccaneers rookie quarterback Jameis Winston is distracted by the battle that\u2019s raging between him and the woman who accused him of sexual assault, it\u2019s not showing on the field.", "og": {"site_name": "TBO.com", "description": "If Buccaneers rookie quarterback Jameis Winston is distracted by the battle that\u2019s raging between him and the woman who accused him of sexual assault, it\u2019s not showing on the field.", "title": "Bucs Beat: Winston\u2019s early knowledge of playbook earns Smith\u2019s praise", "url": "http://www.tbo.com/sports/bucs/bucs-beat-winstons-early-knowledge-of-playbook-earns-smiths-praise-20150510/", "image": {"width": 1195, "identifier": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20150510/ARTICLE/150519955/AR/0/AR-150519955.jpg", "height": 1800}, "updated_time": "2015-05-10T09:04:00Z-04", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "tbo.com", "description": "If Buccaneers rookie quarterback Jameis Winston is distracted by the battle that\u2019s raging between him and the woman who accused him of sexual assault, it\u2019s not showing on the field.", "title": "Bucs Beat: Winston\u2019s early knowledge of playbook earns Smith\u2019s praise", "image": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20150510/ARTICLE/150519955/AR/0/AR-150519955.jpg", "site": "@TBOcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 522234267826834}, "msvalidate.01": "29E67031F86E7FB6DF9823924E21B8B4", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/tbocom", "published_time": "2015-05-10T01:00:00Z-04", "modified_time": "2015-05-10T09:04:00Z-04"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "And we definitely saw that (Saturday), like we did (Friday).\u201dIt wasn\u2019t just Winston\u2019s focus that was sharp on Day 2 of rookie minicamp.\nThe Division III product can compete to start at center or guard.\u201dStick aroundOf the 55 players attending rookie minicamp, 36 are doing so on a tryout basis.\nWinston has only had about a week to examine the offensive playbook, but he\u2019s already impressing his new coaches with his knowledge of it.\nAfter turning in an erratic throwing performance on Day 1, Winston was more on point on Saturday.\n\u201cHe\u2019s been cramming like it\u2019s the final exam, and he\u2019s doing a good job of it,\u201d Smith said."}
