You get the idea.\n\nPredicting a decline to one-to-one for the exchange rate is becoming an increasingly popular sport.\n\nDeutsche Bank, whose thoughts are worth a mention since it\u2019s the second biggest bank in FX trading, has been in the bearish camp for a while. Now it\u2019s even deeper in bear territory, predicting the rate will drop to $0.85 two years from now.\n\nThe bank revised lower its forecasts on the euro against the dollar Tuesday, taking the view that European investors will shift their assets towards foreign markets, and in particular the U.S., the U.K. and Canada.\n\nStrategists George Saravelos and Robin Winkler expect the euro to fall towards parity by the end of 2015 from a previous forecast of 1.05. From there, the euro will keep plummeting to 0.90 by 2016 and 0.85 in 2017.\n\nThat\u2019s one of the most bearish calls so far on the euro.\n\nPushed down by the combined effect of the ECB bond-buying program and the prospect of an interest rate rise in the U.S., the euro has lost about 12% since the start of the year agains the dollar. That\u2019s a big move for a major currency. It\u2019s worth pointing out that it\u2019s lost less against a trade-weighted basket of other currencies, which you can read all about here.\n\nFor Deutsche Bank, capital flows are key. Local investors will grow tired of the tiny returns available in the region\u2019s pricey bond market, and look elsewhere, the bank reckons.\n\nCapital outflows will be of about \u20ac4 trillion ($4.3 billion). Assuming net financial outflows of \u20ac150 billion a quarter, this process will take the rest of the decade, it says. \u201cThe primary destination of European outflows will be core fixed income markets in the rest of the world, and evidence over the last few months supports these trends,\u201d they say.\n\nForeign buyers of European bonds are not expected to make up the gap.\n\n\u201cWe are seeing large outflows from European fixed income,\u201d said Adrian Owens, a currency funds manager at GAM last week. \u201cWhy buy Bunds at 35 basis points? Why buy euro debt from Coca-Cola at these yields? Central bank reserve managers are also moving out of the euro.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "The decline and fall of the euro\u2019s exchange rate against the dollar is moving at an eyebrow-raising rate.", "title": "Euro: Watch Out Below, Says Deutsche Bank", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2015/03/10/euro-watch-out-below-says-deutsche-bank/", "image": {"src": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-HI370_0310eu_P_20150310131657.jpg"}, "site": "WSJMoneyBeat", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Markets", "article.headline": "Euro: Watch Out Below, Says Deutsche Bank", "description": "The decline and fall of the euro\u2019s exchange rate against the dollar is moving at an eyebrow-raising rate.", "article_section": "Markets", "author": "Chiara Albanese", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "MoneyBeat Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "MoneyBeat", "article.summary": "The decline and fall of the euro\u2019s exchange rate against the dollar is moving at an eyebrow-raising rate.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2015-03-10T17:20:19-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-141", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2015/03/10/euro-watch-out-below-says-deutsche-bank/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-MBB-34221", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Markets", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "The decline and fall of the euro\u2019s exchange rate against the dollar is moving at an eyebrow-raising rate.", "title": "Euro: Watch Out Below, Says Deutsche Bank", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2015/03/10/euro-watch-out-below-says-deutsche-bank/", "image": {"width": 749, "identifier": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-HI370_0310eu_P_20150310131657.jpg", "height": 499}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "MoneyBeat", "article.id": "BL-MBB-34221", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2015-03-11T11:47:49-04:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3d02\"", "article_summary": "Deutsche Bank, whose thoughts are worth a mention since it\u2019s the second biggest bank in FX trading, has been in the bearish camp for a while.\nCentral bank reserve managers are also moving out of the euro.\u201d\nGetty ImagesThe decline and fall of the euro\u2019s exchange rate against the dollar is moving at an eyebrow-raising rate.\nLocal investors will grow tired of the tiny returns available in the region\u2019s pricey bond market, and look elsewhere, the bank reckons.\n\u201cWe are seeing large outflows from European fixed income,\u201d said Adrian Owens, a currency funds manager at GAM last week."}
