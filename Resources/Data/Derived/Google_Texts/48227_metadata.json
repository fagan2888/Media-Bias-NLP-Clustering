And it absolutely did, it went about as smooth as you could have expected on the first flight.\u201d\n\nThe fighter\u2019s four-barrel, 25-millimeter Gatling gun squeezed off three bursts, one with 30 rounds and two others with 60 rounds each, according to the office.\n\nThe inaugural airborne test marked the first in a series of trial runs the gun will undergo in the coming months. Officials already ran it through its paces while the plane was parked on the ground, and now they\u2019ll look to see how it performs for air-to-air and air-to-ground missions.\n\nRelated: Yet Another Costly F-35 Glitch That Won\u2019t Be Fixed Any Time Soon\n\nThe F-35\u2019s gun is slated to be operational in 2017, near the end of its system development and demonstration phase, the program office said.\n\nThe successful test is good news for the F-35 program. The effort recently encountered another snag when testers discovered the fifth-generation plane\u2019s ejection seat could cause fatal whiplash for pilots weighing under 136 pounds, despite the fact that the seat was designed to handle any pilot weighing between 103 and 245 pounds.\n\nAir Force leaders expect the seat\u2019s manufacturer, Martin-Baker, to pay for the fix.
