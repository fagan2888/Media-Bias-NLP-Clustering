The 30-minute presentation will begin at 6:30 p.m., followed by a question-and-answer period. The event will also include an ammo trade-in so hunters can ditch their lead ammunition and reloading bullets in return for copper ammunition, the tribe said in a press release.\n\nPart of the tribe\u2019s Hunters as Stewards Campaign, the event will contribute to the push to remove toxic lead from the ecosystem on behalf of all scavenging animals, the Yurok release said.\n\n\u201cWhen presented with accurate information and shown how well non-lead ammunition performs, most hunters decide to give it a try in an effort to clean up the food on their dinner table and the environment,\u201d said Mike Palermo, who is a biologist for the Yurok Tribe Wildlife Program and an avid hunter. \u201cWe invite hunters to bring their lead ammunition and bullets for exchange, and their most difficult questions about lead and non-lead ammo to the free event.\u201d\n\nLead bullets in carrion is a constant health problem for the condor and other scavenging birds, including eagles. Lead poisoning is the worst health problem facing condors, and \u201cspent ammunition is the primary source of lead exposure in condors,\u201d according to the Arizona Game and Fish Department.\n\nRELATED: Bald Eagles Falling Prey to Lead-Laced Bullets in Carrion\n\nAlthough there have been pushes in the past to ban lead bullets, the Yurok does not support such legislation, preferring to trust that hunters, \u201cif provided with the most accurate information about the ill-health effects of lead to their families and the food web, will voluntarily switch to non-toxic ammo,\u201d the Yurok said.\n\nCondors ingest a large portion of their diet from piles of offal from large game left by hunters, but the meat from the elk, deer and bear that are harvested for human consumption can also become contaminated enough to harm people, the Yurok pointed out. And it inhibits efforts to reintroduce the condor in particular. Copper is harder than lead and expands rather than fragments when it hits an animal, the statement noted. Thus it does not leach into the animal\u2019s flesh.
