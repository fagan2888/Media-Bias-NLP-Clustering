Don\u2019t you ever talk about me!\u201d\n\nDeadspin collected the predictable, dispiriting assemblage of racist tweets from those who\u2019d watched the Seahawks game; a black man shouting on television will always be scary to some. But what was notable, here, was what Sherman didn\u2019t do. He didn\u2019t curse, or threaten anyone with anything except a loss, in the future. He seemed to be speaking from a prepared speech in defense of his own talents against anyone who\u2019d challenge them. Isn\u2019t this exactly what football is about?\n\nWhat do people who considered Sherman \u201cclassless\u201d think that they had been watching for hours before? Football is a game in which strong men bash their heads into one another in order to gain ground; there\u2019s nothing about it that\u2019s particularly classy. Quarterbacks tend to dance in the end zone, unless they showily indicate they have a special bond with God that allows them to win. Sherman was making text what had been subtext \u2014 that he and Crabtree (and the Seahawks and 49ers) were engaged in a game of oneupmanship that could only have one winner. To dismiss him is to pretend that football has some loftier purpose, that there are unwritten rules governing behavior after what is in every other of its particulars all about intimidation. Since when is that most violent of sports governed by notions of gentlemanly decorum? And who gets to make those rules, anyway?", "article_metadata": {"description": "Football is America's marquee violent spectacle.
