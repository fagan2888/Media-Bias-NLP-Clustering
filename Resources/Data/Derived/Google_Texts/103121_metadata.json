And he bucked his own party leadership earlier this summer on amendments to defense and water resources appropriations bills.\n\nAccording to data compiled by our partners at CQ, McAllister voted with his party 93.6 percent of the time.\n\nHe's enough of a wild card that some of his critics in the Louisiana GOP have suggested he'd be more at home in the Democratic Party.\n\nFor his part, McAllister says he\u2019s a Republican and plans to remain one.\n\nBut at his town hall meetings, the 40-year-old father of five made no apologies for taking what he described as a practical, solutions-oriented approach to politics.\n\nHe decried the far right\u2019s antipathy for Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. \u2014 \u201cWhether you like Eric Holder or not, at some point you have to deal with what\u2019s there\u201d \u2014 and called for a two-party solution to the border crisis: \u201cIt\u2019s not a red or blue issue, it\u2019s a purple issue.\n\nHe added in Tallulah, \u201cThis whole mentality of the far right versus the far left \u2026 it sells newspapers and generates cable TV ratings, but it solves nothing. And it\u2019s destroying the country.\u201d\n\nIt was a theme McAllister returned to throughout the day, criticizing what he called the \u201cJust Vote No\u201d caucus.\n\nToo many lawmakers in safe districts, he said, vote no to avoid taking responsibility for solving the nation\u2019s problems. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to say no to everything. You can always defend a \u2018no\u2019 vote.\u201d\n\nStill, McAllister\u2019s calls for more bipartisanship haven\u2019t sat well with some of Louisiana\u2019s tea party types looking for a more confrontational, Ted Cruz-style Republican.\n\nHe\u2019s also fallen out of favor with many of the state\u2019s establishment GOP leaders (including Gov. Bobby Jindal, who called on him to resign ) who had their own plans for the seat that McAllister swooped in and nabbed last year.\n\nMembers of those two wings of the state Republican Party had hoped to coalesce by now around one candidate to bump off the incumbent.\n\nBut as the field increasingly looks set for the 5th District race \u2014 with the incumbent flanked by Democrat Jamie Mayo on the left and four insurgent Republicans on the right \u2014 McAllister has the middle all to himself.\n\nSeveral attendees at McAllister\u2019s town hall meetings warned the congressman not to underestimate Mayo, a dynamic, multi-term mayor of a 49,000-population Monroe, the largest city in the northeast Louisiana district. Mayo finished third in the running for the 5th District seat last year.\n\nBut Mayo, who is African-American, is embroiled in his own front-page drama in Monroe, where the city\u2019s first black chief of police is under fire from the police union. Mayo, defending the chief, blamed the controversy last week on racism and \u201csabotage\u201d by his political opponents.\n\nRunning to McAllister's right are Ralph Abraham, a physician from Mangham; Zach Dasher, a pharmaceutical salesman and a cousin of the \"Duck Dynasty\" reality show stars; former district attorney Ed Tarpley of Alexandria and Monroe businessman Harris Brown.\n\nLocal press paid a lot of attention to a recent poll from the Louisiana-based Glascock Group that found McAllister was the top choice of 27 percent of respondents in the 5th District \u2014 6 points ahead of Mayo.\n\nNone of the other six challengers \u2014 four Republicans and two libertarians \u2014 were above 18 percent.\n\nAll are campaigning as more conservative alternatives to the incumbent, effectively splitting the anti-McAllister vote in the GOP \u2014 and breathing new life into a political career many in Washington had written off just a few weeks ago.\n\nUnder Louisiana\u2019s \u201cblanket primary,\u201d all eight candidates appear on the November ballot. If no candidate tops 50 percent, the top two vote-getters advance to a Dec. 6 runoff. It's not uncommon for races in the Pelican State to be decided so late.\n\nThe Rothenberg Political Report/Roll Call rates this race Safe Republican .\n\nRelated stories: xx\n\nJindal Calls McAllister an \u2018Embarrassment\u2019 Rich Candidates, Poor House Districts Vance McAllister Announces He Will Seek Re-Election Roll Call Election Map: Race Ratings for Every Seat Get breaking news alerts and more from Roll Call in your inbox or on your iPhone.", "article_metadata": {"description": "TALLULAH, La. \u2014 Vance McAllister's political career flatlined earlier this year, a victim of self-inflicted wounds from an embarrassing infidelity scandal.", "og": {"site_name": "Roll Call", "description": "TALLULAH, La. \u2014 Vance McAllister's political career flatlined earlier this year, a victim of self-inflicted wounds from an embarrassing infidelity scandal.", "title": "McAllister Moving Past 'Kissing Congressman'", "url": "http://www.rollcall.com/news/home/vance-mcallister-kissing-congressman-campaign", "image": {"identifier": "http://cdn.videos.rollcall.com/atr/2-445x333.jpg", "type": "image/png"}, "updated_time": "2014-08-18T15:55:42Z", "type": "website"}, "abstract": "TALLULAH, La. \u2014 Vance McAllister's political career flatlined earlier this year, a victim of self-inflicted wounds from an embarrassing infidelity scandal.", "fb": {"app_id": 1383531991672364}, "keywords": "Blog ID,Author,author,category,category,category,category,category,category,category,RC-Tags,CQToday Topic,house-2016,la-5,on-the-trail,primaries,race-ratings,republicans,safe-republican,Roll Call on the Road,Roll Call on the Road \u2014 LA,poli", "article": {"section": "home", "published_time": "2014-08-18T15:55:42Z", "modified_time": "2014-08-18T15:55:42Z"}, "twitter": {"description": "TALLULAH, La. \u2014 Vance McAllister's political career flatlined earlier this year, a victim of self-inflicted wounds from an embarrassing infidelity scandal.", "title": "McAllister Moving Past 'Kissing Congressman'", "url": "http://www.rollcall.com/news/home/vance-mcallister-kissing-congressman-campaign", "image": {"src": "http://cdn.videos.rollcall.com/atr/2-445x333.jpg"}, "site": "@rollcall", "card": "summary |player (See: https://dev.twitter.com/cards/types/player We will have to submit a test and get approval before using this type)"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd6d14\"", "article_summary": "Bobby Jindal, who called on him to resign ) who had their own plans for the seat that McAllister swooped in and nabbed last year.\nMayo finished third in the running for the 5th District seat last year.\nAccording to data compiled by our partners at CQ, McAllister voted with his party 93.6 percent of the time.\nAnd it\u2019s destroying the country.\u201dIt was a theme McAllister returned to throughout the day, criticizing what he called the \u201cJust Vote No\u201d caucus.\nFor his part, McAllister says he\u2019s a Republican and plans to remain one."}
