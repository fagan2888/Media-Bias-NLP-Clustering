Five years later, his parents made a choice that would change Andrew\u2019s life forever.\n\nA story of how God, parents and a community made @TheCUTCH22 a superstar.\n\nThe date was Aug. 1, 1992. After time apart at separate colleges, Lo and Trina found themselves reunited in Fort Meade, Fla. That\u2019s when they decided to get married.\n\nTheir story\u2014and the rise of Andrew, reigning National League MVP\u2014is chronicled in this week\u2019s Sports Illustrated. The union of Lo and Trina is described as a life-changing moment for young Andrew.\n\n\u201cTrina decided that there was no one better to teach Andrew to be a man than his father,\u201d Albert Chen writes in Sports Illustrated. \u201cThat day they made a pact: They were going to raise this child right, with all the work and all the love that would be required.\u201d\n\nAndrew would eventually lead the Pittsburgh Pirates to their first winning season in 20 years, claiming the MVP award in the process. The former first-round draft pick has matured into a four-time All-Star whose team is on the verge of a second straight playoff appearance.\n\nBut long before landing in Pittsburgh, the McCutchens were a poor family living in Fort Meade, a city of about 5,000 in central Florida. Lo worked three jobs\u2014including an overnight shift in a phosphate mine\u2014to support the family. Trina is still working at the local sheriff\u2019s department to support the family\u2019s younger daughter in college.\n\nAt a young age, Andrew showed a love of baseball\u2014and he had a father who was willing to forego sleep to forge a bond with his son. Chen describes the early-morning practices when Andrew was a young boy and the financial challenges the family faced as Andrew grew older.\n\n\u201cThey were going to raise this child right, with all the work and all the love that would be required.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s when others stepped in. When Andrew was given the opportunity to compete at a higher level but lacked the financial resources to afford a travel baseball league, a coach named Jimmy Rutland offered to help.\n\n\u201cLo and Trina saw Andrew\u2019s love for the game, they saw this man willing to give them a hand, they remembered the pact they\u2019d made,\u201d Chen writes. \u201cThey decided, OK, let\u2019s make this work.\u201d\n\nIn the years that followed, Trina sold spaghetti dinners for $5.50 a pop to pay for Andrew\u2019s baseball tournaments. The community came together to raise $5,000 to send Andrew to Puerto Rico to play ball.\n\nHis parents\u2019 hard work rubbed off on Andrew, who \u201cdidn\u2019t beg Lo and Trina for money; he began working odd jobs,\u201d Chen writes.\n\nToday, Andrew credits God, his parents and his hometown community for shaping his life. Off the field, he\u2019ll soon follow in Lo and Trina\u2019s footsteps by marrying longtime girlfriend Maria Hanslovan.\n\n\u201cA lot of things had to happen; a lot of people had to come into your life,\u201d he tells Chen. And that\u2019s a reason he\u2019s decided to give back to those in need, visiting patients in a Pittsburgh hospital and helping out on Habitat for Humanity projects.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t until this year\u2014as I\u2019m getting married\u2014that I really started thinking about where my parents were at the point they got married,\u201d McCutchen tells Sports Illustrated. \u201cThey were 22 years old, moving in together for the first time with a 5-year-old kid, learning how to live together, wondering how they would have enough money. I don\u2019t know how they did it, because that\u2019s a lot.\u201d\n\nWhen @TheCUTCH22 was 5 years old, his parents made a choice that would change his life forever.\n\nLo and Trina\u2019s decision to get married\u2013after having Andrew\u2013is not the norm today, even though marriage has been hailed as \u201cthe greatest weapon against child poverty.\u201d\n\nAccording to Heritage Foundation senior research fellow Robert Rector, who analyzed Census data to study the impact of marriage, \u201cAmong black married couples, the poverty rate was 7 percent, while the rate for non-married black families was seven times higher at 35.6 percent.\u201d\n\nPresident Obama has called for a reversal of this trend. Speaking at the historically black Morehouse College last year, Obama implored graduates: \u201cKeep setting an example for what it means to be a man. Be the best husband to your wife, or your boyfriend, or your partner. Be the best father you can be to your children. Because nothing is more important.\u201d\n\nFor Andrew McCutchen, Lo is that man. In an Instagram post on Father\u2019s Day, McCutchen expressed his gratitude for his father:", "article_metadata": {"description": "Baseball star player Andrew McCutchen credits God, his parents and his hometown community for shaping his life.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Baseball star player Andrew McCutchen credits God, his parents and his hometown community for shaping his life.", "title": "How One Decision by Two Parents Shaped the Life of a Baseball MVP", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/140909_AndrewMcCutchen_Bluey1.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-01-19T22:24:35+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/WMhP8e"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Baseball star player Andrew McCutchen credits God, his parents and his hometown community for shaping his life.", "title": "How One Decision by Two Parents Shaped the Life of a Baseball MVP", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/140909_AndrewMcCutchen_Bluey1.jpg"}, "creator": "@RobertBluey", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Society", "tag": "Marriage and Family,sports", "published_time": "2014-09-09T09:47:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-01-19T22:24:35+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "andrew mccutchen, pittsburgh pirates, sports illustrated, maria hanslovan, marriage, baseball, mvp, albert chen"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcbb4a\"", "article_summary": "Because nothing is more important.\u201dFor Andrew McCutchen, Lo is that man.\nFive years later, his parents made a choice that would change Andrew\u2019s life forever.\nToday, Andrew credits God, his parents and his hometown community for shaping his life.\n\u201cA lot of things had to happen; a lot of people had to come into your life,\u201d he tells Chen.\nHis parents\u2019 hard work rubbed off on Andrew, who \u201cdidn\u2019t beg Lo and Trina for money; he began working odd jobs,\u201d Chen writes."}
