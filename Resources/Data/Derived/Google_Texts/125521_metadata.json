Lindsey Graham ripped former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee Wednesday over claims that the GOP-led Senate has done \u201cnothing\u201d on a multitude of issues, saying he doesn\u2019t know \u201cwhat he\u2019s talking about.\u201d\n\nAppearing on \u201cThe Hugh Hewitt Show,\u201d Graham took the former governor to task after Huckabee wondered why he went out to campaign nationwide for Senate candidates last year in an attempt to get the majority.\n\nIn his comments, Huckabee blasted the GOP-controlled Senate, saying that rather than stopping President Barack Obama\u2019s \u201cexecutive overreach\u201d on various issues, including Obamacare, the chamber has done \u201cnothing.\u201d The former Fox News host added that \u201cI\u2019m not sure I did that last year.\u201d\n\nThe South Carolina senator told Hewitt that Huckabee needed a \u201ccivics\u201d lesson, adding flatly that \u201cyou\u2019re not going to repeal Obamacare with Obama sitting in office.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think he knows what he\u2019s talking about,\u201d Graham said. \u201cWe have voted umpteen times to repeal Obamacare. At the end of the day, you\u2019re not going to repeal Obamacare as long as he\u2019s president.\u201d\n\n\u201cHaving a Republican majority means a lot. I think we\u2019re doing things in the Senate today we would never have gotten to do otherwise. We sent the Keystone Pipeline to his desk. He vetoed it. We\u2019ve stopped their agenda in their tracks,\u201d Graham continued. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to get 60 votes to do the big things. You\u2019ve got a Democratic president you\u2019ve got to deal with. I think it would be insane for us to repeal the filibuster, which has been a check and balance to bad ideas for a very, very long time.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd at the end of the day, here\u2019s civics. Mike, you\u2019re not going to repeal Obamacare with Obama sitting in office,\u201d Graham said. \u201cThe only way you\u2019re going to repeal Obamacare is to get a Republican elected. You\u2019re not going to get a Republican elected to the presidency that doesn\u2019t believe you\u2019ve got to reform entitlements.\u201d\n\nLISTEN:\n\n", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Al Weaver", "description": "Sen.
