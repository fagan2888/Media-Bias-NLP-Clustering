The rate peaked in the first quarter of 2010 at 6.94 percent.\n\n\u201cWe will be able to say we have fully recovered from the Great Recession at the end of 2016,\u201d says Ezra Becker, TransUnion\u2019s vice president of research and consulting. He noted that delinquency rates for credit cards and auto loans had already long recovered. \u201cMortgages were holding back the credit recovery,\u201d he said.\n\nRelated: The 12 States with the Hottest Housing Markets\n\nThe mortgage market looks much different than in 2010, when 15.7 percent of mortgages belonged to borrowers with poor credit. Now, only 7.8 percent of all mortgages are held by subprime consumers.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if that is too high or too low. But I know that the newer loans are performing better,\u201d said Becker. The number of foreclosure starts dropped 15 percent in November to the lowest monthly total since May 2005, according to a RealtyTrac report released Thursday.\n\nTransUnion noted also noted that the average debt per borrower has steadily grown since 2012 and is forecast to reach $192,512 by the end of next year. That comes as housing prices have risen almost 31 percent since cratering in February 2012.\n\nStill, the housing market has yet to completely recover from the downturn: Home values remain 5 percent off their July 2006 peak.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Six and half years after the end of the Great Recession and five years since foreclosu", "title": "A Key Measure of the Mortgage Market Is on Track to Finally Recover in 2016", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/12/10/Key-Measure-Mortgage-Market-Track-Finally-Recover-2016", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/08082011_Mortgage_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/12/10/Key-Measure-Mortgage-Market-Track-Finally-Recover-2016", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/08082011_Mortgage_article.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "Six and half years after the end of the Great Recession and five years since foreclosu", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "The rate peaked in the first quarter of 2010 at 6.94 percent.\nStill, the housing market has yet to completely recover from the downturn: Home values remain 5 percent off their July 2006 peak.\nRelated: The 12 States with the Hottest Housing MarketsThe mortgage market looks much different than in 2010, when 15.7 percent of mortgages belonged to borrowers with poor credit.\n\u201cWe will be able to say we have fully recovered from the Great Recession at the end of 2016,\u201d says Ezra Becker, TransUnion\u2019s vice president of research and consulting.\nHe noted that delinquency rates for credit cards and auto loans had already long recovered."}
