Blue Cross & Blue Shield of Illinois, the dominant insurer in the state, dropped its popular broad PPO plan in 2015 (nixing several prominent local academic medical centers) in favor of a narrower PPO plan with fewer doctors and hospitals in-network.\n\nLand of Lincoln, which lost $25.8 million in the first six months of 2015, has capped enrollment for small businesses and individuals to help it survive. Academic medical centers are typically more expensive than community hospitals because they treat the sickest patients.\n\nU of C Medicine started telling patients in late December that it would no longer be in the co-op's network, spokeswoman Ashley Heher said. She estimated that a few hundred patients have the plan. They still can see a U of C Medicine doctor, but they will pay a steeper price than if they were in-network.", "article_metadata": {"byline": "Kristen Schorsch", "timeCrawled": "20160527_02:45:58", "categoryName": "CCB - Health Care", "title": "Struggling Illinois Obamacare health Land of Lincoln Health plan to nix University of Chicago Medicine", "taxo_Industries": "Hospitals", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=571426684", "image": "http://www.chicagobusiness.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/CG/20160119/NEWS03/160119828/AR/0/obamacare-dumps-university-of-chicago.jpg", "msapplication-TileColor": "#2d89ef", "og": {"site_name": "Crain's Chicago Business", "description": "The move by Land of Lincoln Health comes after consumers and small businesses already have enrolled in the Chicago-based co-op's plans.", "title": "Illinois Obamacare plan drops U of C Medicine", "url": "http://www.chicagobusiness.com/article/20160119/NEWS03/160119828/illinois-obamacare-plan-drops-u-of-c-medicine", "image": "http://www.chicagobusiness.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/CG/20160119/NEWS03/160119828/AR/0/obamacare-dumps-university-of-chicago.jpg", "type": "article"}, "summary": "The move by Land of Lincoln Health comes after consumers and small businesses already have enrolled in the Chicago-based co-op's plans.", "fb": {"admins": 100001125868754}, "url": "http://www.chicagobusiness.com/article//NEWS03/160119828", "published_at": "2016-1-19", "msapplication-TileImage": "/assets/icons/mstile-144x144.png", "content_type": "article", "taxo_Companies": "University of Chicago Medicine", "google-site-verification": "0QcjJi4OGS9bKu4FBKK58V93fKv0WYCQb7IFbmjATew", "twitter": {"image": "http://www.chicagobusiness.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/CG/20160119/NEWS03/160119828/AR/0/obamacare-dumps-university-of-chicago.jpg&maxw=400", "site": "@CrainsChicago", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Struggling Illinois Obamacare health Land of Lincoln Health plan to nix University of Chicago Medicine"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no, minimal-ui", "description": "Visit Crain's Chicago Business for complete business news and analysis including healthcare, real estate, manufacturing, government, sports and more."}, "article_summary": "Struggling Land of Lincoln Health is dropping University of Chicago Medicine from its network as of March 1.\nConsumers and small businesses have been undergoing drastic changes on the Obamacare exchange since its return a few months ago.\nThey still can see a U of C Medicine doctor, but they will pay a steeper price than if they were in-network.\nThe move comes after consumers and small businesses already have enrolled in the Chicago-based co-op's plans sold on the Obamacare exchange since Nov. 1.\nU of C Medicine started telling patients in late December that it would no longer be in the co-op's network, spokeswoman Ashley Heher said."}
