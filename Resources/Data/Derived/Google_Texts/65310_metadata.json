Asa Hutchinson told reporters Friday he wants health care to be the sole topic of a special session beginning April 6, one week before the Legislature\u2019s scheduled fiscal session.\n\nThe governor said he will ask legislators to approve his plan for continuing and revamping Arkansas\u2019 Medicaid expansion program, which he wants to rename Arkansas Works, and his plan to let a private company or companies manage parts of the traditional Medicaid program. Draft bills containing both plans are currently circulating among legislators.\n\nHutchinson has said he plans to call a second special session after the fiscal session to consider his plan for boosting highway funding. He told reporters Thursday that if lawmakers want to consider other topics, \u201cthat should be in the second special session.\u201d\n\nThe governor said the draft bills containing his plans for Medicaid include a \u201cnumber of historic precedents and firsts.\u201d\n\nOne of those firsts is a proposed requirement that participants in the Medicaid expansion program \u2014 which uses federal Medicaid money to subsidize private health insurance for people earning up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level \u2014 obtain employer-sponsored health insurance, if a cost-effective, small-group plan is available. The ideas has not been tried by any state.\n\nArkansas would provide as-yet-unspecified incentives to eligible businesses with 50 or fewer employees. Employees would receive premium assistance through Medicaid.\n\nHutchinson said the incentives would be limited to small employers, initially, because they are the ones most likely to shift their employees to the Medicaid expansion program in the absence of incentives to offer coverage to their employees.\n\n\u201cThe focus first would be on the small business employers, but then we also want to look at the larger employers and see whether there is a means to bring them in and save money with them as well,\u201d he said.\n\nHutchinson also said the draft of the Medicaid Reform Act, which contains his managed-care plan, would create $1.4 billion in estimated savings in the overall Medicaid budget over the next five years.\n\nUnder the managed-care plan, the state would agree to pay a per-person rate to a company or companies to manage parts of the Medicaid program concerning dental care and services for people with developmental disabilities and behavioral health issues. The companies would make a profit if they can provide services for less than the agreed-upon rate but would lose money if their costs go above the rate.\n\nThe legislation also contains reporting requirements for managed care and \u201cprovides for the first time in the history of this state a providers\u2019, patients\u2019 and taxpayers\u2019 bill of rights,\u201d Hutchinson said.\n\nAmong other things, the bill of rights would guarantee that a health-care provider not be paid below the prevailing Medicaid fee schedule by a managed-care company.\n\nThe legislation also would create a trust fund intended to reduce a waiting list for home- and community based services for disabled people. The list currently includes more than 3,000 Arkansans.\n\nAlso circulating among legislators is an alternative draft bill, the Managed Fee-For-Service Act, which calls for the state to enter into contracts with vendors to provide administrative services instead of handing over parts of the Medicaid program to private companies. Vendors that meet agreed-upon benchmarks would be eligible for incentives, and vendors that fail to meet benchmarks would have to pay fees.\n\nHutchinson said he has not yet read that draft, which has been floated by a group of legislators.\n\nAll of the measures need a simple majority vote for approval during the special session. Appropriating federal funding for Arkansas Works during the fiscal session will be more difficult, as it will require a three-fourths majority vote in each chamber.", "article_metadata": {"description": "LITTLE ROCK \u2014 Gov.
