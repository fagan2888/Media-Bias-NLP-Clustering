Bob Rankin, R-Carbondale, and Millie Hamner, D-Frisco, and Sen. Kerry Donovan, D-Vail, didn\u2019t hesitate to take their calls.\n\nOn behalf of those commissioners, the three lawmakers got the Colorado Legislature to approve a bill \u2014 one that Gov. John Hickenlooper signed into law on Tuesday \u2014 to study what\u2019s driving those skyrocketing costs.\n\n\u201cWe need to get some answers because the problem we\u2019ve been having around the rising costs of health care ... is we can\u2019t get to the reason why,\u201d said Donovan, whose district includes Delta County. \u201cIt\u2019s like throwing questions into a black box. Everyone seems to point to another aspect of the system.\u201d\n\nEven before the federal Affordable Care Act became law several years ago, the cost of private health care in the state\u2019s mountain communities was high. That act, designed to provide health care coverage for everyone, sent it even higher primarily because it ended up placing many more people onto the state\u2019s Medicaid rolls, the lawmakers said.\n\nThat led to cost shifting by providers and insurers, which helped send private rates even higher, said Rankin, who introduced HB1336 into the Colorado House with Hamner, whose district includes parts of Delta County.\n\n\u201cThe whole issue of transference of costs is that private payers pay more so that (providers) can make up for their losses from Medicaid,\u201d said Rankin, who serves on the Legislature\u2019s powerful Joint Budget Committee with Hamner. \u201cMedicaid\u2019s killing us across the board. It\u2019s our biggest state budget problem. Access is not adequate for the people who are on it, and doctors are not paid enough. It\u2019s just a disaster.\u201d\n\nThe two real forces behind the study were Garfield County Commissioner Tom Jankovsky and Summit County Commissioner Dan Gibbs, who both testified in favor of the bill when it was heard in the Legislature.\n\n\u201cThis was a totally nonpartisan effort,\u201d Rankin said. \u201cThis is their bill, their idea. There is no easy answer, so the best we could do is try to get some transparency and see where to go from there.\u201d\n\nThe lawmakers said premiums for residents in the mountainous areas of the state saw a 26 percent rise in health costs this year, at a time when the average cost increase statewide was only 9.8 percent.\n\nThe bill calls on Commissioner of Insurance Marguerite Salazar in the Colorado Department of Regulatory Agencies to study what\u2019s driving the cost of health care premiums in the state, and to see if creating a single geographical area \u2014 the entire state \u2014 to determine rates would be more equitable, rather than the nine that currently are used.\n\nMesa County is one of those geographic areas.\n\nWhen the bill was being debated in the statehouse, it met with opposition from several Front Range lawmakers \u2014 all Republicans \u2014 who complained that such a change would only lead to higher rates for their constituents.\n\nRankin, however, said he doesn\u2019t expect that to be the case, saying that putting the entire state together could dramatically lower premiums for mountainous areas of the state that have limited health care providers while having little impact on more populous regions of Colorado.\n\nThe new law also calls on the study to be completed by August, giving the lawmakers time to examine it and propose changes during the 2017 legislative session.", "article_metadata": {"geo.region": "US-CO", "DC.format": "text/html", "geo.placename": "Grand Junction", "description": "Grand Junction - When Republican and Democratic commissioners from Garfield and Summit counties came to three local state lawmakers before the start of this", "geo.position": "39.0500,-108.5500", "DC.description": "Grand Junction - When Republican and Democratic commissioners from Garfield and Summit counties came to three local state lawmakers before the start of this", "DC.identifier": "http://www.gjsentinel.com/news/articles/unequal-8232health-costs-8232at-center-of-8232new/", "DC.type": "Text", "robots": "index,follow,archive", "DC.publisher": "GJSentinel.com/The Grand Junction Daily Sentinel", "DC.date.valid": "2016-06-02T00:32:05-0600", "DC.creator": "Charles Ashby", "DC.rights": "The Grand Junction Daily Sentinel", "keywords": ",colorado legislature 2016,garfield county,kerry donovan,miller hamner,summit county,unequal health costs", "DC.date.created": "2016-05-18T05:48:35-0600", "DC.subject": ",colorado legislature 2016,garfield county,kerry donovan,miller hamner,summit county,unequal health costs", "DC.date.modified": "2016-05-18T15:22:36-0600", "DC.title": "Unequal \u2028health costs \u2028at center of \u2028new inquiry  |  GJSentinel.com"}, "article_summary": "Unequal health costs at center of new inquiryWhen Republican and Democratic commissioners from Garfield and Summit counties came to three local state lawmakers before the start of this year\u2019s legislative session about the rising cost of health care, the three knew they had a troubling issue on their hands.\n\u201cWe need to get some answers because the problem we\u2019ve been having around the rising costs of health care ... is we can\u2019t get to the reason why,\u201d said Donovan, whose district includes Delta County.\nThat act, designed to provide health care coverage for everyone, sent it even higher primarily because it ended up placing many more people onto the state\u2019s Medicaid rolls, the lawmakers said.\nJohn Hickenlooper signed into law on Tuesday \u2014 to study what\u2019s driving those skyrocketing costs.\nEveryone seems to point to another aspect of the system.\u201dEven before the federal Affordable Care Act became law several years ago, the cost of private health care in the state\u2019s mountain communities was high."}
