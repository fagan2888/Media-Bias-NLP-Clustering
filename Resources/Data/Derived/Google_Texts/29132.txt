2014 U.S. Senate

Democratic Senator Jeff Merkley will continue to represent Oregon in Washington, D.C., for another term. He defeated Monica Wehby.

Both candidates used attack ads at times during the campaign. Wehby criticized the sitting senator for partisan voting, including his staunch support of the Affordable Care Act, and supposedly underpaying females on his staff. The first-time politician beat out Republican rival Jeff Conger in the May primaries, positioning herself as a moderate candidate.

Merkley’s campaign concentrated on the rookie politician’s mistakes, and criticized Wehby for featuring content lifted from right-leaning sources on her website, including a survey by Karl Rove’s political action committee, American Crossroads. Following the plagiarism allegations, the campaign removed the language from its website and Wehby said the staff who had published the content no longer worked for her.

Merkley and Wehby participated in only one debate in Medford after Wehby’s campaign missed the deadline to participate in the KGW-Oregonian debate. Wehby followed up by inviting Merkley to three more debates during October, which he declined.

Both candidates brought high-profile politicians to the state in October. Sen. John McCain (Arizona-R) spoke in support of Wehby in Salem and Vice President Joe Biden held a rally for Merkley in Portland. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (Massachusetts-D) also made an appearance on the University of Oregon campus in Eugene for the Oregon senator.
