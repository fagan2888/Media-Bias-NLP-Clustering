And John Oliver came back strong, taking on Brian Williams, Downton Abbey, the President of Argentina, and RadioShack in just the first few minutes.\n\nBut Oliver devoted his longest segment to tackling prescription drug companies.\n\nPrescription drug companies apparently spend $24 billion dollars marketing to healthcare providers; no wonder about the \u201cask your doctor\u201d slogan that comes at the end of prescription drug commercials. They also spent more money on marketing than doing research on their products. Cue Oliver: \u201cDrug companies are a bit like high school boyfriends. They\u2019re much more concerned with getting inside you than being effective once they\u2019re in there.\u201d\n\nWhat I love about Last Week Tonight is that Oliver often provides helpful links or a call-to-action. Thanks to the Affordable Care Act, people can search a federal website to see all the perks given to physicians by pharmaceutical companies: https://openpaymentsdata.cms.gov/\n\nThe last topic was Ecuador\u2019s president, Rafael Correa, who attacks anyone who criticizes him \u2014 including an 18-year-old Twitter user. \u201cHow are you getting involved in a Twitter war?!\u201d Then Oliver went on to brilliantly roast Correa and encourage people to tweet him @MashiRafael.\n\nLast Week Tonight with John Oliver airs Sunday nights on HBO.", "article_metadata": {"ca_image": "http://i0.wp.com/popinsomniacs.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/last-week-tonight-john-oliver.jpg?resize=150%2C150", "og": {"site_name": "Pop Insomniacs", "description": "In case you missed it, Last Week Tonight with John Oliver came back for its second season on HBO.
