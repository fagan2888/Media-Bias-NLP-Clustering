In the controversial Burwell v. Hobby Lobby decision, the Supreme Court ruled that the crafts superstore can't be compelled to offer birth control to its employees under the Affordable Care Act. Ironically, the decision seems to have given birth to a new group of Americans: the Beyoncé voters. Fox News's Jesse Watters coined the term to refer to single women, predicting this demographic will be a coveted bloc to court come election time. “I call them the Beyoncé voters, the single ladies,” Watters declared. ("Single Ladies," get it?) “Obama won the single ladies by 76 percent last time, and they made up about a quarter of the electorate. You know, they depend on government because they’re not depending on their husbands. They need things like contraception, health care, and they love to talk about equal pay.” The term went viral, spawning a Tumblr account matching lyrics of Beyoncé hits to photos of influential women, and eliciting snarky responses from “typical” single women (“We are a monolithic block [sic], each and every one dedicated to premarital sex, hedonism, socialism, white wine, and tweeting about misogyny”).
