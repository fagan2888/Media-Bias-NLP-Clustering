A recent study shows Floridians spend their time Googling Obamacare, concealed weapons permits and Donald Trump's net worth, among other things.

Real estate blog Estately ran hundreds of terms through Google Trends to determine what people in each state searched for more often than people in any other state in 2015.

Results for the Sunshine State Included "Obamacare," "concealed weapons permit," "Marco Rubio," "Trump net worth" and "house prices."

All and all, they are all pretty tame, responsible terms -- at least compared to other states. People in Georgia searched for "stanky leg dance" and "whip dance," while people in Massachusetts searched "dad bod."

Michiganders seem to be curious about LGBT lifestyle, searching "what is transgender?" and "marriage equality."

People in Utah seem excited for "Star Wars: The Force Awakes" and those in West Virginia like "Magic Mike XXL" (its only result).
