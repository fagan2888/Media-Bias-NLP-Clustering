Front St., will treat an estimated 4,626 new clients at the end of its first year and 5,368 total new patients a year later, all regardless of ability to pay.That equates to nearly 13,000 more medical visits a year.From health care providers' view, it will improve Clallam County's ability to recruit hotly sought primary care physicians by forgiving their student loans.The residency program may provide additional dividends because, according to Dr. Mike Maxwell of Family Medicine, about half of doctors remain in the communities where they complete their training.Family Medicine will continue to provide primary and ob/gyn care from its current location, 204 W. Front St.It will partner with Peninsula Behavioral Health, 118 E. Eighth St., for mental health services and with Sea Mar CHC, doing business as Port Angeles Dental, 228 W. First St., for dental care.Family Medicine's current clients will see no immediate changes but will receive the new services as they become available, said Maxwell, the new organization's CEO.Family Medicine learned of its $700,000 grant from the Health Resources and Services Administration and U.S. Sen. Patty Murray, D-Seattle.Although it had been anticipated for months, the news caught Maxwell by surprise.\u201cI likened it to being in the desert and very thirsty and finally getting that drink of water \u2014 from a fire hose,\u201d he said.It will take about three months to organize the new health care center and make it operational, he said.Family Medicine's caregivers recently absorbed 3,000 patients who had lost their providers to doctors' retirements.While they awaited the federal funds, Family Medicine hired five new doctors, two as a husband-and-wife team who will share one full-time position, with the lure of the grant.The residency also was a major recruiting tool, Maxwell said, raising the new doctors' hopes that they could teach and train medical school graduates.Besides the additional doctors, a cadre of nurse case managers will look after patients with long-term, high-risk illnesses like chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or acute diabetes.Patient navigators also will help patients along paths that may lead from Family Medicine to hospitalization to rehabilitation.The new providers and patients will make Family Medicine's building \u201ca little cozier,\u201d Maxwell said, \u201cbut when we built this place, we had this in the back of our minds.\u201dFamily Medicine of Port Angeles, which opened in 1979, occupied a clinic at 404 W. Eighth St. from 1990 to 2009.In 2010, it remodeled and moved into the former City Light Building at West Front and North Cherry streets.As for its future funding under the Affordable Care Act, Maxwell noted that community health centers have existed for about 50 years and even opponents of what some people call Obamacare support them to serve under-served areas such as Clallam County.With the start of the North Olympic Healthcare Network, Clallam no longer will be the state's sole county without a federal health center.For its application, Family Medicine secured endorsements from every health care agency on the North Olympic Peninsula, Maxwell said, and senators Murray and Maria Cantwell and Rep. Derek Kilmer.\u201cThis looks like the most immediate and long-term solution,\u201d he said, to a shortage of family physicians that has left many newcomers to the area \u2014 even established patients whose doctors have retired or moved away \u2014 with months-long waits for primary care.\u201cThe hardest thing to do as a physician or a clinic,\u201d Maxwell said, \u201cis to tell a patient, 'No.'\u201d________Reporter James Casey can be reached at 360-452-2345, ext. 5074, or at jcasey@peninsuladailynews.com", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "port angeles newspaper, sequim newspaper, port townsend newspaper, olympic peninsula newspaper, daily news, port angeles classifieds, sequim classifieds, port townsend classifieds, local weather, local news, olympic peninsula obituaries, port angeles obituaries, sequim obituaries, port townsend obituaries,pdn,port angeles,sequim,port townsend,olympic peninsula", "og": {"url": "http://www.peninsuladailynews.com/article/20150512/NEWS/305129988", "site_name": "Peninsula Daily News", "image": "http://www.peninsuladailynews.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/bilde?Site=PT&Date=20150512&Category=NEWS&ArtNo=305129988&Ref=AR", "type": "article", "title": "Port Angeles clinic receives federal health center status; designation will widen services to Peninsula"}, "fb": {"admins": 100002304548680, "app_id": 224084277650041}, "description": "Your #1 News Source for the Olympic Peninsula, Port Angeles, Sequim, Port Townsend and beyond."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd909f\"", "article_summary": "Port Angeles clinic receives federal health center status; designation will widen services to PeninsulaBy James CaseyPeninsula Daily NewsWhat's the difference?\nTo learn more about Family Medicine of Port Angeles, visit www.fmpa.net.\nAs the nonprofit North Olympic Healthcare Network, the present Family Medicine of Port Angeles will:\u25a0 Function under a board of nine to 25 directors, most of whom will be clients.\n\u25a0 Receive cost-based Medicare reimbursement \u2014 including a 34 percent increase for each new patient \u2014 and enhanced payments from Medicaid.\nTo learn more about the federal health center program, visit http://tinyurl.com/PDN-HealthProgram."}
