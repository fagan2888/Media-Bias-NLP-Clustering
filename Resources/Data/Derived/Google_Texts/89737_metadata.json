At the same time, the bill reflects careful consideration of every program, cutting the fat and making the most of every dollar.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is a fiscally responsible bill that reduces discretionary spending by nearly $4 billion. At the same time, by carefully reprioritizing where taxpayer dollars are spent, the bill increases funding for important programs that benefit the American people,\u201d added Labor, Health and Human Services Subcommittee Chairman Tom Cole. \u201cThis bill reflects the values and priorities of the American taxpayer, setting us on a path that will reduce the deficit while funding programs that make meaningful differences in the lives of Americans.\u201d\n\nMedical research conducted by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) are the biggest winners in the healthcare portion of the appropriations bill. The NIH would receive a total of $31.2 billion in 2016, which is $1.1 billion more than the previous year and $100 million more than President Obama\u2019s initial request.\n\nThe CDC would also receive a raise over the previous year\u2019s funding, with a total of $7 billion going to projects such as fighting prescription drug abuse and improving the nation\u2019s capabilities to respond to infectious disease outbreaks and other public health risks.\n\nThe funds will support a number of big data analytics and population health management projects and studies within the NIH, including $165 million for the National Children\u2019s Study and $480.6 million for Clinical and Translational Sciences Awards. Alzheimer\u2019s disease research will be allotted $886 million, a $300 million increase over 2015, while antibiotic resistance efforts will receive $461 million in supporting funds.\n\nThe President\u2019s precision medicine initiative, an effort to recruit one million patients to contribute their data and genetic material into a new, nationwide data registry and biobank, will receive the full $200 million requested by the Administration. The legislation makes specific mention of the need to strengthen patient privacy and security controls within precision medicine research projects, and would direct \u201cinvestigators receiving NIH funding for new and competing research projects designed to generate and analyze large volumes of data derived from human research participants to obtain a certificate of confidentiality.\u201d\n\nDespite its positive implications for certain aspects of medical research, the bill would \u201cterminate\u201d the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), a vocal participant in many of the research projects focused on fostering clinical analytics and population health management across academic and provider settings. AHRQ has doled out millions in grant funding to industry stakeholders, spanning such subjects as chronic disease management, EHR implementation and usability, patient safety, clinical quality standards, and meaningful use.\n\nThe legislation also \u201cdefunds existing ObamaCare programs and prohibits any new discretionary funding from being used to further implement ObamaCare,\u201d the press release states, continuing contentious political wrangling over the future of the Affordable Care Act and its financial implications.\n\nThe appropriations bill will be considered in subcommittee before potentially moving through the legislative process. As with previous budget bills, it will no doubt undergo numerous changes before it reaches the President\u2019s desk.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Precision medicine may get its funding in a new draft appropriations bill, but the AHRQ and ACA risk getting gutted.", "author": "HealthITAnalytics", "og": {"url": "http://healthitanalytics.com/news/new-budget-bill-would-fund-precision-medicine-eliminate-ahrq", "site_name": "HealthITAnalytics", "image": "http://healthitanalytics.com/images/site/articles/153430966-200200.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "New Budget Bill Would Fund Precision Medicine, Eliminate AHRQ"}, "twitter": {"description": "Precision medicine may get its funding in a new draft appropriations bill, but the AHRQ and ACA risk getting gutted.", "creator": "@HITAnalytics", "image": {"src": "http://healthitanalytics.com/images/site/articles/153430966-200200.jpg"}, "title": "New Budget Bill Would Fund Precision Medicine, Eliminate AHRQ", "site": "@HITAnalytics", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd07b3\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThis bill fulfills these goals, funding cutting-edge medical research, education for disabled children, veterans\u2019 programs, community health centers, Meals on Wheels, and charter schools.\nAs with previous budget bills, it will no doubt undergo numerous changes before it reaches the President\u2019s desk.\nAlzheimer\u2019s disease research will be allotted $886 million, a $300 million increase over 2015, while antibiotic resistance efforts will receive $461 million in supporting funds.\nThe appropriations bill will be considered in subcommittee before potentially moving through the legislative process.\nAt the same time, the bill reflects careful consideration of every program, cutting the fat and making the most of every dollar.\u201d\u201cThis is a fiscally responsible bill that reduces discretionary spending by nearly $4 billion."}
