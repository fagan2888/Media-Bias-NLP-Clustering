UnitedHealthcare has retail locations in Edison and Lakewood and AmeriHealth NJ has several retail kiosks throughout the state, which the company launched in 2012.\n\n\u201cHorizon continues to transform the health insurance experience by making it more personalized, with one-on-one attention to help consumers make informed decisions about their coverage,\u201d said Joseph Albano, vice president of consumer and dental markets for Horizon. \u201cIn addition to the outreach we provide through Horizon Connect, our Blue to You Mobile Program and many other community-based initiatives, we\u2019re extending staff, including bilingual agents, to mall locations to better accommodate consumers during the open enrollment period for the individual market.\u201d\n\nRELATED: N.J.'s Obamacare enrollment could reach 250,000 in 2015\n\nThe Affordable Care Act \u2014 whose \u201cindividual mandate\u201d requires most Americans to either get health coverage or pay penalties \u2014 is a major engine behind the push toward retail health insurance\n\nNearly 160,000 New Jerseyans have so far purchased their own health insurance plans at HealthCare.gov, the new insurance exchange created by the ACA, and Rutgers estimates that number could rise to 250,000 in 2015, the second year of the Obamacare exchange. Open enrollment for 2015 coverage begins Saturday and runs through Feb. 15, 2015. Horizon is among five health insurers selling coverage to New Jerseyans on HealthCare.gov.\n\nClick here to subscribe to the NJBIZ e-newsletters\n\nWhile the majority of New Jerseyans get health coverage through their job, workers are increasingly expected to choose their own plan \u2014 and figure out how much they want to spend out of pocket to get the coverage they want. Many employers are considering switching to \u201cprivate exchanges\u201d where their employees get a large menus of plans and prices to choose from, rather than have the employer offer a handful couple of plans to the entire workforce.\n\nLinda Schwimmer, vice president of the New Jersey Health Care Quality Institute, said, \u201cI think that in-person supports and especially multilingual support is absolutely needed, and I applaud Horizon for expanding their outreach into the community to help consumers pick a plan.\u201d She noted that the Horizon stores will promote the company\u2019s plans: \u201cTherefore, there is a need for neutral navigators and brokers and other trained professionals to help people choose among all of the plans and pick the one that is best for them.\u201d\n\nHorizon said its mall kiosks have partitioned spaces where consumers can meet with Horizon agents to ask questions about health coverage. Consumers can find out if they are eligible for a government subsidy to help them afford a policy on HealthCare.gov. Of the nearly 160,000 New Jerseyans who have used HealthCare.gov buy coverage, more than 80 percent have qualified for subsidies, which are on a sliding scale and phase out entirely at four times the federal poverty level, or about $46,600 for an individual and $95,400 for a family of four.\n\nAetna doesn\u2019t have any New Jersey retail locations, but will soon have two in Florida, according to spokesman Susan Millerick. Aetna is participating in the ACA exchange in Florida but not in New Jersey.\n\n\u201cThe ACA has unquestionably changed how people buy health insurance, and has given health plans a mighty push forward into simplifying our products and selling them in new ways, including through retail stores and kiosks,\u201d she said. \u201cAetna is testing how retail stores work in Florida for exchange customers, and for off-exchange shoppers, we also are trying membership club stores in some states, such as Costco, where Aetna sells health benefit products to individuals, and Sam\u2019s Club stores, where we sell products to small businesses. The search is definitely on to find the best ways to educate newcomers to health insurance about how to shop.\u201d\n\nJoel Cantor, director of the Rutgers Center for State Health Policy, said: \"Anything that insurers can do to help educate the uninsured is helpful. Studies show that literacy of health insurance terms is quite low, particularly among the uninsured. It is an enormously complex product.\"\n\nALSO ON NJBIZ:\n\nNJBIZ Power 50 Real Estate leaders revealed (slideshow)\n\nRutgers Business School names new dean, effective Jan. 1\n\nValley Medical Group creates chief operating officer position", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "NJBIZ", "description": "Horizon Blue Cross Blue Shield of New Jersey has expanded its Horizon Connect retail centers to four New Jersey shopping malls, where the state's largest health insurer can directly reach consumers w", "title": "Horizon BCBS of N.J. opens insurance kiosks at four more malls | NJBIZ", "url": "http://www.njbiz.com/article/20141112/NJBIZ01/141119898/horizon-bcbs-of-nj-opens-insurance-kiosks-at-four-more-malls", "image": "http://www.njbiz.com/images/njbiz-logo-share.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "njbiz.com", "description": "Horizon Blue Cross Blue Shield of New Jersey has expanded its Horizon Connect retail centers to four New Jersey shopping malls, where the state's largest health insurer can directly reach consumers w", "title": "Horizon BCBS of N.J. opens insurance kiosks at four more malls | NJBIZ", "image": {"src": "http://www.njbiz.com/images/njbiz-logo-share.jpg"}, "creator": "@bethfitzgerald8", "site": "@njbiz", "card": "summary"}, "description": "Horizon Blue Cross Blue Shield of New Jersey has expanded its Horizon Connect retail centers to four New Jersey shopping malls, where the state's largest health insurer can directly reach consumers who increasingly must shop for their own health coverage.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcbc9f\"", "article_summary": "Studies show that literacy of health insurance terms is quite low, particularly among the uninsured.\nHorizon opened its first Horizon Connect Retail Center in 2012 in Moorestown, later adding a second location in Wall Township.\nHorizon is not alone is its efforts to engage potential health insurance customers on the same turf where they buy socks, shoes and power tools.\nAetna doesn\u2019t have any New Jersey retail locations, but will soon have two in Florida, according to spokesman Susan Millerick.\n\u201cThe ACA has unquestionably changed how people buy health insurance, and has given health plans a mighty push forward into simplifying our products and selling them in new ways, including through retail stores and kiosks,\u201d she said."}
