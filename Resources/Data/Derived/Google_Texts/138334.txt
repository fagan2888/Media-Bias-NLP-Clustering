--“Obama Presses Insurers for Health-Law Help as Democrats Waver,” by Bloomberg’s Roxana Tiron, Mike Dorning and Roger Runningen: “Fifteen insurance industry representatives met … with Obama [in the Roosevelt Room shortly after the House vote] … During the discussion, industry officials said the [one-year reprieve for people with canceled policies] would complicate efforts to draw enough of the young and healthy enrollees … Attendees talked about improving the flow of data from the online exchange to insurers … Obama and the executives also discussed efforts to begin direct enrollment in subsidized plans through insurance company websites.”

TOP TALKER – “With Amazon’s ‘Alpha House,’ Garry Trudeau again trains his cross-hairs on D.C.,” by WashPost’s Michael Cavna in New York: “As the church doors open, Tom Brokaw and Michael Steele pivot quickly in opposite directions, neither of them quite sure what to do with the dead man. … Some Beltway fixtures, like Jeff Greenfield and Dick Morris, calmly wave from the scrum of dark designer suits. Anthony Weiner is subdued and largely confined to the sidelines. Grover Norquist … gets to say a line or two on camera. From beyond the bright lights pops Garry Trudeau, who is choreographing this dance of famous faces. The celebrated political satirist, best known as creator of the Pulitzer-winning comic strip ‘Doonesbury,’ … is channeling his inner Robert Altman. The late filmmaker was his partner on HBO’s ‘Tanner ’88’ and the Sundance Channel’s ‘Tanner on Tanner’ (2004), a pair of comedy series that served as Trudeau’s early forays into live-action televised political sendups. … ‘For the first time, I’m the boss,’ the 65-year-old New York native says on his lunch break….

“‘Alpha House’ [is] the first original series from Amazon Studios … (You can watch the first three episodes for free starting [now]; streaming the season’s remaining eight weekly episodes online will require signing up for Amazon Prime, which gives you access to Amazon Prime Instant Video. … ) ‘Alpha House’ is a pioneer, perhaps a bellwether — and, just maybe, the canary in the gold mine. As online-streaming programmers aim to make inroads into Hollywood, Netflix already has its Emmy-winning political show, ‘House of Cards,’ which gained insta-cred after it landed Oscar-winning Kevin Spacey and Robin Wright in starring roles. Now, Amazon Studios is betting on a political comedy that has a lofty pedigree of its own. … Based on a real Hill living arrangement from last decade, “Alpha House” centers on four Republican senators who are also roommates [including] John Goodman …

“[T]he left-leaning cartoonist was inspired after reading a [2007] New York Times piece by Mark Leibovich about four Democrats who were ‘Real World’-style roomies: Rep. George Miller, Sen. Richard J. Durbin, Sen. Charles E. Schumer and Rep. Bill Delahunt. He wrote a script, but the project never gained traction. In 2012, Trudeau’s friend Jonathan Alter [now executive producer of ‘Alpha House’] got a tip from former CNN president Jon Klein. ‘He told me Amazon was going into the content business.’” http://goo.gl/Ok4Drw

SCOOP – WSJ A1, “Geithner Heads To Private Equity,” by Ryan Dezember, with Deborah Solomon: “Former U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner, one of the architects of the federal government's rescue of the financial system, is joining private-equity firm Warburg Pincus LLC. Mr. Geithner, who has spent most of his career outside the private sector, said in an interview he plans to start in March at the New York-based firm, known for its role in buyouts of companies including eye-care firm Bausch & Lomb Inc., luxury retailer Neiman Marcus Group Inc. and stadium concessionaire Aramark Corp. … At Warburg, he will serve as president and managing director, not the kind of figurehead or advisory positions that public-sector figures often land after government stints. Mr. Geithner, 52 years old, is expected to work on mapping the firm's strategy and management, investor relations and on matters related to the firm's investments. … Citing the firm's global reach and ‘low-key’ nature, he said Warburg is ‘culturally very compatible with what I was looking for.’

“Warburg Co-Chief Executive Charles Kaye said Mr. Geithner will … ‘very much be here every day.’ … The former Treasury secretary will join a long line of public servants going into private equity after government service. Earlier this year, KKR tapped David Petraeus … to lead an internal team focused on macroeconomic forecasting and public policy. Former Vice President Dan Quayle and former Treasury Secretary John Snow work for Cerberus Capital Management LP. Carlyle Group LP has enlisted many officials from the Bush and Clinton administrations, including former Secretary of State James Baker III, in advisory roles. … Fund executives can accumulate substantial wealth if the investments perform well. …

“Geithner, who has two young-adult children, lives just north of New York City in suburban Larchmont. … The Warburg job will be Mr. Geithner's first private-sector position since he worked early in his career for Kissinger Associates … Since leaving Treasury, Mr. Geithner hit the speaking circuit, fetching big fees to speak at corporate events, including Warburg's annual meeting in May.” http://goo.gl/XLAebz

--WARBURG BACKGROUND – A September article by Forbes, “Warburg Pincus: The Merchant Of Modest”: “While others in the business have expanded their financial offerings -- from renewable energy at Carlyle to retail junk bond mutual funds at KKR -- Warburg has [stuck] to the basic … buyout business, avoiding ten-figure megadeals. Often it acts more like a venture capital firm, buying big into small, unproven companies. Warburg didn’t go public like Blackstone and the Carlyle Group during the recent wave.” http://goo.gl/JTg9FC

JEREMY W. PETERS, on the cover of N.Y. Times “Sunday Styles” section, “The Gayest Place in America?”: “My earliest sense of what it meant to be gay in the nation’s capital came more than a decade ago when I was a summer intern. I was a few blocks from Union Station when a congressman walked by and gave the reporters I was standing with a big, floppy wave hello. ‘You know what they say about him,’ said one of them, the inflection of his voice rising to a squeak so there could be no mistaking what he meant. I didn’t know, in fact. I wasn’t even sure what the congressman’s name was. But the message was as clear as it was unsettling for a 20-year-old struggling with his own sexual identity: There were plenty of gay people in Washington, even at the highest levels of government. But instead of being widely accepted, they were usually whispered about derisively, suspect characters to be mocked and maligned.

“Today, having moved here 10 months ago after six and a half years of living in Manhattan, I hardly recognize that closeted, often intolerant Washington I first glimpsed as a 20-year-old. I now live in the gayest place in America. … One of my first observations about my new city was the throngs of gay men I would see over the course of a typical day all over town — walking their dogs in my neighborhood before work, riding the Metro, working in the halls of Congress. … Such ubiquity isn’t just an abundance of gay bars, though there are at least six within walking distance of my house in the Logan Circle neighborhood of Northwest Washington.

“On the days I make the 20-minute walk from home to my office near the White House, I will pass one example after another of this city’s thriving gay economy: a Mitchell Gold & Bob Williams furniture store; a clothing retailer whose window displays regularly feature bare-torso, well-endowed mannequins in nothing but tiny briefs; three CrossFit gyms; the offices of two gay newspapers, The Washington Blade and Metro Weekly (most cities cannot even sustain one); a bathhouse; and the national headquarters for the Human Rights Campaign. …

“It was only during the Clinton years that the White House finally ended the decades-long practice of denying security clearance to people known to be gay or lesbian. That meant in order to be considered for many high-level jobs involving access to classified information, gays and lesbians had to concoct a web of lies about their personal lives. Steve Elmendorf, a Democratic lobbyist who worked on Capitol Hill for years, described how he and his gay friends had to make sure they all gave the same references to government agents investigating their backgrounds, an insurance policy so that if the question of their sexual orientation came up, they could be certain no one unpredictable would spill the truth.

“Hilary Rosen, a longtime Democratic lobbyist, told me that in the 1980s she once unsuccessfully tried to persuade Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah, to support a bill that would have given more AIDS-prevention money to San Francisco. ‘He said to me with much concern and affection, “Oh, Hilary, why would you want to help those people?”’ she said. ‘When I told him I was actually one of those people, he shook his head, tried to change the subject and voted against us.’ … Hatch recently voted for legislation to include gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people in federal nondiscrimination law. … Elmendorf … thinks that gay people, because they were mostly without children, were able to resist the draw of higher pay in the private sector. ‘All the straight people would leave, worrying about how they were going to send their kids to Sidwell Friends.’” http://goo.gl/DrPKcw

DIGITAL DOWNLOAD – L.A. Times Business lead, “Values of social media start-ups boom: Are the huge numbers a ‘form of delusion,’ a good bet or something in between?” by Jessica Guynn in S.F.: “Snapchat is not even 3 years old. It's run by a couple of twentysomethings with no prior business experience. And it has never made a cent. Yet investors are fighting for the opportunity to throw hundreds of millions at the mobile messaging service that is all the rage with teens. The tiny Venice Beach start-up just turned down a $3-billion all-cash offer from Facebook Inc. And then, according to the Silicon Valley rumor mill, it rejected an offer from Google Inc., this one for $4 billion. … Among the better-known Silicon Valley companies with monster truck-sized valuations are mobile payments start-up Square Inc. at $3.25 billion, online storage start-up Dropbox Inc. at $4 billion, private transportation service Uber Technologies Inc. at $3.5 billion and home rental service Airbnb Inc. at $2.5 billion.

“These sky-high valuations for companies with untested business models are giving some people a bad case of dot-com deja vu. … Technology giants are willing to spend large sums of money buying these start-ups to keep up with young people's rapidly evolving online habits. … Pinterest … just raised $225 million from investors, valuing it at $3.8 billion … Pinterest has tens of millions of users, some of whom spend hours a day on the service, yet it has just begun to explore how it will make money … [A]lthough valuations in Silicon Valley are clearly inflated, they may not be as bubbly as they sound, some experts say. Twitter is just the latest social media company to show it can make money from its massive audience. And its successful initial public offering — it ended its first day of trading with a $25-billion market cap despite never having turned a profit — has whetted investors' appetite for companies with significant growth potential.

“Contributing to the current fervor: Investors are feeling more optimistic, with the Dow Jones industrial average and Standard & Poor's 500 indexes rising to record highs. … A federal law enacted last year that will allow start-ups to raise money from smaller investors could send tech valuations even higher. Their target: social media. With the success of Facebook, LinkedIn Corp. and now Twitter, the sector has proved it is not a passing fad.” http://goo.gl/t4TGY0

UNDER THE HOOD -- WashPost A1 sidebar, “HEALTHCARE.GOV PROBLEMS: Lead developer hired many who worked at troubled tech company,” by Jerry Markon and Alice Crites: “The lead contractor on the dysfunctional Web site for the Affordable Care Act is filled with executives from a company that mishandled at least 20 other government IT projects … CGI Federal … entered the U.S. government market a decade ago when its parent company purchased American Management Systems, a Fairfax County contractor that was coming off a series of troubled projects. CGI moved into AMS’s custom-made building off Interstate 66, changed the sign outside and kept the core of employees, who now populate the upper ranks of CGI Federal. … A year before CGI Group acquired AMS in 2004, AMS settled a lawsuit brought by the head of the Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board, which had hired the company to upgrade the agency’s computer system. AMS had gone $60 million over budget and virtually all of the computer code it wrote turned out to be useless …

“AMS-built computer systems sent Philadelphia school district paychecks to dead people, shipped military parts to the wrong places for the Defense Logistics Agency and made 380,000 programming errors for the Wisconsin revenue department, forcing counties to repay millions of dollars in incorrectly calculated sales taxes. … The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) — the government agency that awarded the Affordable Care Act contract to CGI Federal — previously rejected the company’s bid in 2010 to perform work on four health IT systems in part because of ‘performance issues’ in carrying out an earlier contract.” http://goo.gl/g0J0Kl

BRUCE REED IN THE NEWS – L.A. Times second front, “A busy week for the Broad philanthropies: Foundation president named; $100 million donated to institute,” by Michael Memoli and Jason Song: “The Eli and Edythe Broad Foundation named a high-ranking White House official as its first president this week. In addition, the Broads announced a $100-million gift to their institute focused on biomedical research in Cambridge, Mass. The moves reflect the significant interest the Broads have in education and research throughout the country. The foundation tapped Bruce Reed, Vice President Joe Biden's chief of staff for nearly three years, to oversee its Los Angeles-based philanthropic group that backs efforts to improve urban public schools. … Reed has served in senior positions in both the Obama and Clinton administrations and will join the foundation in mid-December.

“Reed has been involved in education policy since he worked for then-Sen. Al Gore (D-Tenn.) in the 1980s. He went on to become the policy chief for Bill Clinton's presidential campaign in 1992, then worked in the White House for eight years, becoming domestic policy advisor in Clinton's second term. … The foundation has led numerous efforts to change public schools nationwide. Opponents accuse the foundation and its allies of pursuing a corporate agenda that undermines teacher unions.” With fantastic pic, “Eli and Edythe Broad are shown in their Los Angeles home.” http://goo.gl/TdG6ID

BUSINESS BURST – WSJ A1, “REBOOT AT MICROSOFT: Impatient Board Sped Ballmer’s Exit,” by Monica Langley in Redmond, Wash, with Shira Ovide and Joann S. Lublin: “Steve Ballmer paced his corner office on a foggy January morning here, listening through loudspeakers to his directors' voices on a call that would set in motion the end of his 13-year reign as Microsoft Corp.'s chief executive. Microsoft lagged behind Apple Inc. and Google Inc. in important consumer markets, despite its formidable software revenue. Mr. Ballmer tried to spell out his plan to remake Microsoft, but a director cut him off, telling him he was moving too slowly. ‘Hey, dude, let's get on with it,’ lead director John Thompson says he told him. ‘We're in suspended animation.’ … [T]he contentious call put him on a difficult journey toward his August decision to retire, sending Microsoft into further tumult as it began seeking a successor to a man who has been at its heart for 33 years.

“‘Maybe I'm an emblem of an old era, and I have to move on,’ the 57-year-old Mr. Ballmer says, pausing as his eyes well up. … ‘[T]he best way for Microsoft to enter a new era is a new leader who will accelerate change.’ … Mr. Ballmer, in a series of exclusive interviews tinged with his characteristic bluster and wistfulness, tells of how he came to believe that he couldn't lead Microsoft forward—that, in fact, Microsoft would not be led by him because of the very corporate culture he had helped instill…. The Microsoft board's list of possible successors includes, among others, former Nokia Corp. CEO Stephen Elop, Microsoft enterprise-software chief Satya Nadella and Ford Motor Co. CEO Alan Mulally …

“Microsoft's next chief will be only the third in its history [after Bill Gates and Ballmer]. Mr. Ballmer joined in 1980 at the suggestion of his Harvard University pal, … Gates, and is its second-largest individual shareholder and a billionaire. … Ballmer says he is weighing casual offers as varied as university teaching and coaching his youngest son's high-school basketball team. He plans no big decisions for at least six months -- except that he won't run another big company. He says he's open to remaining a Microsoft director.” http://goo.gl/nDssSO
