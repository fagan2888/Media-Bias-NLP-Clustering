It is story of continuity and change.\n\nThe color line in the Age of Obama, and the post-civil rights era more broadly, is built upon a skeleton of white supremacy and white privilege even while the shape of its superstructure may suggest that much racial progress has in fact been made.\n\nIn the United States, the result\u2014a type of institutional white supremacy that still features moments of direct, interpersonal, \u201cold-fashioned\u201d racism by the State and white individuals against people of color\u2014is a riddle of sorts, the answer to which most reasonable, just, and good people already know. Unfortunately, White America continues to treat justice along the color line as a type of unsolvable puzzle, when in reality the answers are readily apparent.\n\nThere has been substantive racial progress in the United States in terms of dismantling de jure white supremacy. But, the impact of centuries of white supremacy as law, day-to-day practice and culture has not been fully (or I would suggest even significantly) remediated.\n\nThe symbolic progress along the color line is substantial. The American people elected a black man as president. Post-civil rights era America features a multicultural neoliberal leadership class and elite. While embattled by the Great Recession, the black and brown professional classes comprise a substantial part of the African-American community. America\u2019s popular culture is global\u2014and one of its hallmarks is the hyper-visibility of black and brown faces. \u201cDiversity,\u201d \u201ctolerance\u201d and \u201canti-racism\u201d are fully enshrined in America\u2019s civil religion (even while not being fully embraced by all Americans in private or translating into full racial equality in the public sphere). The Black Freedom Struggle also inspired other groups of people such as gays and lesbians to fight for full equality under the law.\n\nThe symbolic progress along the color line exists in tension with semi-permanent racial inequality in a society structured to protect, maintain and advance white privilege.\n\nFor example, the United States maintains levels of school and residential segregation that have been unchanged since Jim and Jane Crow. Personal social networks are also highly segregated: 75 percent of white Americans do not have one non-white friend. Wealth and income inequality along the color line is stark: white Americans have at least 10 times the wealth of black Americans (with some estimates suggesting that the gap may be almost 70 times greater). The Republican Party and the White Right have launched a viciously racist assault on the won-in-blood victories of the Black Freedom Struggle such as the voting rights, civil rights and fair housing laws.\n\nFrom the racist origins of modern policing in chattel slavery, through to Jim Crow-era debt peonage and chain gangs, the American criminal justice system remains one of the most racist and discriminatory political institutions in the United States as it disproportionately and more severely punishes black and brown Americans as compared to whites.\n\nThe body of Freddie Gray, and the community of Baltimore in which he lived, display those attributes in stark and bloody relief.\n\nThe 1968 Kerner Report on the urban \u201criots\u201d of the 1960s is a magisterial accomplishment.\n\nHowever, the Kerner Report was not the only document to detail and explore the causes of the urban rebellions of that tumultuous decade.\n\nLess known among the general public, David Sears\u2019 and Tim Tomlinson\u2019s 1968 article \u201cRiot Ideology in Los Angeles: A Study of Negro Attitudes\u201d was part of pioneering work in public opinion that actually sought to understand the beliefs and values of black Americans who lived in the urban communities that rebelled against white supremacy and racial inequality during the 1960s.\n\nSears\u2019 and Tomlinson\u2019s findings about the divergent understandings held by white and black Americans in response to the urban rebellions in the 1960s resonate in the present.\n\nFor example, in the aftermath of the Baltimore uprising, NBC and The Wall Street Journal conducted a poll, which found:\n\nSix-in-10 African-Americans said that the discord in Baltimore is attributable to \u201cpeople with longstanding frustrations about police mistreatment of African Americans that have not been addressed.\u201d Twenty-seven percent said that the riots were \u201ccaused by people who used the protests about the death of an African-American man in police custody as an excuse to engage in looting and violence.\u201d Among whites, those results were almost exactly flipped. Just 32 percent cited longstanding frustration about African-Americans\u2019 treatment at the hands of police, while 58 percent said the Baltimore violence was caused by those using Gray\u2019s death as an excuse for looting.\n\nSears and Tomlinson detailed how 58 percent of whites in their research felt that the Los Angeles area disturbances of 1965 were a \u201criot\u201d as compared to 46 percent of blacks who felt the same way. Approximately 50 years later, white attitudes toward black \u201criots\u201d have remained virtually unchanged.\n\nBy contrast, more than a third of blacks surveyed by Sears and Tomlinson felt that it was a \u201crevolt, revolution, or insurrection.\u201d Only 13 percent of whites had similar feelings. Almost a third of whites also felt that the \u201criots\u201d were some type of \u201cdisaster, tragedy, mess, disgrace,\u201d or other like term.\n\nSears\u2019 and Tomlinson\u2019s conversations with the black residents in the Los Angeles area during the time period of 1965 to 1966 revealed a sense of frustration, upset and dismay at how racism and classism limited the life chances of the people who lived there.\n\nIn the conclusion to \u201cRiot Ideology in Los Angeles: A Study of Negro Attitudes,\u201d Sears and Tomlinson write how:\n\nThe causes of the riot were described in terms of genuine grievances with those who were attacked; e.g., a history of friction, discrimination, and economic exploitation with local merchants and police. The purpose of the riot was seen as being, on the one hand, to call the attention of whites to Negro problems, and on the other, to express resentment against malefactors\u2026Perhaps the most important fact of all is that so many Negroes felt disposed to justify and ennoble the riot after it was all over. It was not viewed as an alien disruption of their peaceful lives, but as an expression of protest by the Negro community as a whole, again an oppressive majority.\n\nBusiness Insider\u2019s recent story on the social, political and historical context for the killing of Freddie Gray and the Baltimore uprising mirrors the findings of Sears and Tomlinson:\n\nVaughn De Vaughn, a local teacher, told The Baltimore Sun: \u201cThis is about anger and frustration and them not knowing how to express it.\u201d Coates makes the point that \u201cwhen nonviolence is preached by the representatives of the state, while the state doles out heaps of violence to its citizens, it reveals itself to be a con.\u201d The Baltimore Sun revealed in an extensive investigation published in September that the city has paid about $5.7 million since 2011 over police brutality lawsuits. The wording of the story\u2019s opening sentences seem like ominous foreshadowing today \u2014 the newspaper noted that \u201cthe perception that officers are violent can poison the relationship between residents and police.\u201d Michael A. Fletcher wrote in The Washington Post that \u201cit was only a matter of time before Baltimore exploded.\u201d He continued: \u201cIn the more than three decades I have called this city home, Baltimore has been a combustible mix of poverty, crime, and hopelessness, uncomfortably juxtaposed against rich history, friendly people, venerable institutions and pockets of old-money affluence.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The dog-whistle racism of Fox News is one of the more powerful reminders of how little has changed in the U.S.", "title": "White America\u2019s half century of shame: How the media\u2019s Baltimore racism reveals a shocking lack of progress", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The dog-whistle racism of Fox News is one of the more powerful reminders of how little has changed in the U.S.", "title": "White America\u2019s half century of shame: How the media\u2019s Baltimore racism reveals a shocking lack of progress", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/05/09/white_americas_enduring_disgrace_how_the_medias_baltimore_racism_reveals_a_shocking_lack_of_progress/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/03/oreilly_hannity.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The dog-whistle racism of Fox News is one of the more powerful reminders of how little has changed in the U.S.", "title": "White America\u2019s half century of shame: How the media\u2019s Baltimore racism reveals a shocking lack of progress", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/03/oreilly_hannity.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Chauncey DeVega", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Baltimore, Fox News, Racism, White Supremacy", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd080\"", "article_summary": "Topics: Baltimore, Fox News, Racism, White Supremacy, Media News, News, Politics NewsIn the United States, the color line is a paradox.\nThere has been substantive racial progress in the United States in terms of dismantling de jure white supremacy.\nPersonal social networks are also highly segregated: 75 percent of white Americans do not have one non-white friend.\nBut, the impact of centuries of white supremacy as law, day-to-day practice and culture has not been fully (or I would suggest even significantly) remediated.\nThe symbolic progress along the color line is substantial."}
