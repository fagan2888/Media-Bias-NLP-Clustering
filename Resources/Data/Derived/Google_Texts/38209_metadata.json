Its supporters said that the Bill now had a 75 per cent chance of becoming law.\n\nMr Hunt is hoping that the extra safeguard for patients will be enough to see off claims that the Bill is a \u201cquacks\u2019 charter\u201d.\n\nThe Government has decided to support the Bill after new safeguards were agreed with Sir Bruce Keogh, NHS England\u2019s medical director.\n\nThe amended Bill now requires the agreement of at least one other speciallist before trying out untested medical treatments on patients.\n\nCurrently doctors routinely ask colleagues in their hospital for their opinion on how to treat patients in what is called the \u201cBolam test\u201d. The amended Medical Innovation Bill will require them to seek consent from other specialists in the field to pass this test.\n\nThis will stop \u201cdominant personalities\u201d in a hospital \u2013 perhaps a senior consultant \u2013 getting their own way and acting against the interests of the patient.\n\nA Department of Health spokesman said: \u201cInnovation is at the heart of modernising the NHS and is essential for improving treatments and finding new cures and work on the Medical Innovation Bill is ongoing.\n\n\u201cWe are pleased that Lord Saatchi has tabled amendments to the Bill to help ensure patient and staff safety.\u201d A source added: \u201cThe Government is currently minded to support the bill as amended by Lord Saatchi.\u201d\n\nThe amendments have persuaded the General Medical Council \u2013 which opposed any changes in April \u2013 to give its tentative support for the change in the law.\n\nProfessor Sir Peter Rubin, the council\u2019s chairman , said: \u201cMedicine is a risky business. There are many people alive today because of the willingness of doctors to innovate, deal with uncertainty and take reasonable risks which are understood, shared with, and consented to, by the patient in accordance with good medical practice.\n\n\u201cWhile we welcome the amendments to the Bill in Lord Saatchi\u2019s name, we look forward to seeing the final version.\u201d\n\nCancer Research UK, which has also expressed concerns about the originally-drafted Bill, also now supports the change in the law.\n\nSarah Woolnough, the charity's Director of Policy and Information, said it was important that Parliament discussed medical innovation.\n\n\u201cWe know that more could be done to promote innovation in cancer treatment, especially for patients with life-threatening conditions where there are few treatment options, and the Medical Innovation Bill aims to support clinicians to act innovatively where they have exhausted other options.\n\n\u201cThe latest set of amendments laid on the Medical Innovation Bill are an improvement, requiring a doctor to seek advice from an appropriately qualified colleague before departing from standard treatment.\n\n\u201cWe must ensure the Bill contains appropriate safeguards to protect patients. We will monitor the Bill's progress closely and hope we will see a greater focus on innovation thanks to this Bill.\u201d\n\nDespite the changes, other doctors still remain concerned. Michael Baum, Professor Emeritus of Surgery at University College London, said last night: \u201cNever once have we encountered interference or obstruction due to fear of litigation.\n\n\u201cThere are of course many other obstacles to progress but changing the law with this bill is not going to accelerate innovation in cancer therapy, but might, as a result of unintended consequences, endanger our patients by uncontrolled experimentation.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "GSACategory": "health", "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02418/alzheimers-drug_2418085k.jpg"}, "site": "@Telegraph", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@christopherhope"}, "keywords": "Saatchi Bill, Medical Innovation Bill, Lord Saatchi, General Medical Council, Department of Health, Sarah Woolnough, Cancer Research UK, Professor Sir Peter Rubin,, Saatchi Bill,Health,News", "DCSext.cmsSect": "News;Politics;Health;Christopher_Hope;Mobile;Editor's_Picks;Saatchi_Bill", "DCSext.Channel": "news", "DCSext.MLC": "/news/health/saatchi-bill", "DCSext.Content_Type": "Story", "news_keywords": "Saatchi Bill, Medical Innovation Bill, Lord Saatchi, General Medical Council, Department of Health, Sarah Woolnough, Cancer Research UK, Professor Sir Peter Rubin,", "WT.cg_n": "news", "title": "Experimental drugs for patients could be available from March after Government backs Saatchi Bill", "section-id": 7996, "GSAGenre": "saatchibill", "tmgads.pagetype": "Story", "DCSext.akamigeo": "US", "tmgads.section": "news-health-saatchi_bill", "GSAMLC": "news/health/saatchibill", "GSAArticleType": "Story", "DCSext.pd": 1, "WT.cg_s": "health", "description": "Jeremy Hunt throws his health department's weight behind the Medical \n  Innovation Bill which will make it easier for doctors to try out new \n  treatments on patients without the fear of being sued", "tmgads.channel": "news", "article-id": 11173161, "DCSext.Category": "health", "DCSext.Level": 4, "DC.date.issued": "2014-10-19", "robots": "noarchive,noodp", "GSASectionUniqueName": "news-health-saatchi_bill", "last-modified": "2014-10-19", "fb": {"admins": "686953094,531239902,100002344351237", "app_id": 120118784736295}, "article": {"publisher": 143666524748, "contenttype": "story", "section": "News", "wordcount": 900, "embedcount": 0, "authorName": "Christopher Hope", "tag": "Saatchi Bill", "subsection": "Saatchi Bill", "videocount": 0, "internallinkcount": 6, "imagecount": 2, "externallinkcount": 0}, "DCSext.articleId": 11173161, "tmgads.articleid": 11173161, "tmgads.level": 4, "tmgads.geo": "US", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Experimental drugs for patients could be available from March after Government backs Saatchi Bill \",\"link\": \"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/health/saatchi-bill/11173161/Experimental-drugs-for-patients-could-be-available-from-March-after-Government-backs-Saatchi-Bill.html\",\"image_url\": \"http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02418/alzheimers-drug_2418085k.jpg\",\"type\": \"post\",\"post_id\": \"11173161\", \"pub_date\": \"2014-10-19T21:00:29Z\",\"section\": \"News\",\"authors\": [\"Christopher Hope\"],\"tags\": [\"Story\",\"News\",\"Politics\",\"Health\",\"Christopher Hope\",\"Mobile\",\"Editor\\u0027s Picks\",\"Saatchi Bill\"]}", "GSAChannel": "news", "GSAChannelName": "News", "og": {"site_name": "Telegraph.co.uk", "description": "Jeremy Hunt throws his health department's weight behind the Medical   Innovation Bill which will make it easier for doctors to try out new   treatments on patients without the fear of being sued", "title": "Experimental drugs for patients could be available from March after Government backs Saatchi Bill", "url": "http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/health/saatchi-bill/11173161/Experimental-drugs-for-patients-could-be-available-from-March-after-Government-backs-Saatchi-Bill.html", "image": "http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02418/alzheimers-drug_2418085k.jpg", "type": "article"}, "DCSext.Genre": "saatchi-bill", "DCSext.cf": 1, "tmgads.zone": "news.health.saatchi-bill", "DCSext.author": "Christopher Hope", "DCSext.articleFirstPublished": "2014-10-19 20:16"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdacfe\"", "article_summary": "The amended Medical Innovation Bill will require them to seek consent from other specialists in the field to pass this test.\nThe legislation was proposed by Lord Saatchi, the advertising magnate, who started to campaign on the issue after his wife Josephine Hart died from ovarian cancer.\nThe amended Bill now requires the agreement of at least one other speciallist before trying out untested medical treatments on patients.\nLord Saatchi told The Telegraph that the principle of allowing new drugs to be tested on desperately ill people was already being applied in the case of Ebola victims in Africa.\nSarah Woolnough, the charity's Director of Policy and Information, said it was important that Parliament discussed medical innovation."}
