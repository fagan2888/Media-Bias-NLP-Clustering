He was talking about the letter \u201cto the Leaders of the Islamic Republic of Iran\u201d that had been signed by forty-seven Republican senators, including Tom Cotton, of Arkansas, who led the effort. It was an open attempt to disrupt the Obama Administration\u2019s negotiations with Iran on nuclear policy by telling the mullahs that the President of the United States wasn\u2019t someone they should trouble themselves with. Even some Republicans seem a little embarrassed about it now. Megyn Kelly, of Fox News, reflecting conservative criticisms, asked Cotton what the point could be of corresponding with Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. (He said that \u201cexperts\u201d told him that the Iranians didn\u2019t understand the American Constitution.) No Democrats signed the letter. Corker was one of only seven Republican senators who didn\u2019t.\n\nThe other Republican non-signers were Susan Collins, of Maine; Lamar Alexander, of Tennessee; Dan Coats, of Indiana; Lisa Murkowski, of Alaska; Jeff Flake, of Arizona; and Thad Cochran, of Mississippi. There was a certain amount of curiosity about why they hadn\u2019t\u2014as if sending a Dear Ayatollah letter was a fun group activity that they had skipped out on. Collins\u2019s answer was fairly sensible: \u201cI don\u2019t think that the ayatollah is going to be particularly convinced by a letter from members of the Senate.\u201d Others, meanwhile, were more circumspect. \u201cI just didn\u2019t think it was appropriate\u201d (Flake). \u201cI just don\u2019t think we ought to be discussing it in public\u201d (Cochran). Maybe they just didn\u2019t think that the Republican Party had become quite so lacking in leadership. The real question, though, isn\u2019t why the seven didn\u2019t sign, but how Cotton, a freshman senator with a well-known habit of engaging in flights of destructive rhetoric, had persuaded forty-six colleagues to join him.\n\nAs he often points out, Cotton, who is thirty-seven, is both a veteran of Afghanistan and Iraq and a graduate of Harvard Law School. In 2006, when the Times published a piece revealing that the government, in the name of fighting terrorism, had collected the private financial information of Americans who had nothing to do with terrorism, Cotton, then an Army lieutenant stationed in Baghdad, sent a letter to the newspaper, saying that the editors should be put \u201cbehind bars.\u201d The \u201cnext time I hear that familiar explosion\u2014or next time I feel it,\u201d he wrote, \u201cI will wonder whether we could have stopped that bomb had you not instructed terrorists how to evade our financial surveillance.\u201d He added, \u201cI am well-versed in the espionage laws\u201d that could be used to prosecute people at the paper. The Times didn\u2019t publish the letter, but the conservative Web site Power Line did. Cotton was rewarded with praise from conservatives and, after he left the military and returned to his family\u2019s cattle farm in Arkansas, a chance to run for Congress.\n\nIn 2012, he was elected to the House, where one of his first acts was to call for an amendment to a sanctions bill that would impose penalties not only on those who broke the law but also on their relatives, including their \u201cgreat-grandkids,\u201d \u201cto the third degree of sanguinity.\u201d The amendment failed\u2014as the Washington Post pointed out, it was blatantly unconstitutional\u2014but Cotton didn\u2019t have much time for regret, because he had already decided to run for the Senate against Mark Pryor, the two-term Democratic incumbent, with the backing of the Tea Party Express, the Club for Growth, and national Republican figures who regarded his future as limitless. (Last September, the Atlantic ran a profile of Cotton entitled \u201cThe Making of a Conservative Superstar.\u201d)\n\nCotton campaigned by opposing abortion rights and Obamacare, and by appealing to fellow veterans and foreign-policy hawks, while touring the state, as the AP reported, \u201cin a bus decorated with a giant boot print on the front, the Arkansas flag and camouflage.\u201d Last spring, on \u201cMorning Joe,\u201d when asked about suggestions that he was \u201cextreme,\u201d Cotton replied with a reference to Pryor\u2019s record: \u201cThe only thing that\u2019s extreme is casting the decisive vote for Obamacare five years ago.\u201d He beat Pryor by seventeen points. In addition to trying to scuttle the Iran talks, during the two months that Cotton has been in the Senate he has attempted to block the release of any more detainees held at Guant\u00e1namo, even though nearly half of them have been determined to pose no threat to the United States. Cotton\u2019s recommendation was that the prisoners should \u201crot in hell.\u201d\n\nSomething seems to be out of kilter in the political marketplace that yielded Tom Cotton. How are younger legislators with assets like military experience\u2014something in too short supply in Congress\u2014deployed and, more crucially, developed, and which talents are rewarded? In last year\u2019s campaign, Cotton had to answer charges that he was \u201creckless.\u201d Recklessness now seems to be treated as a charm. Extremism, clumsiness, anger\u2014other Republican members of the Senate, with a few hundred years of tenure between them, took a look and jumped on board. What was so appealing? Or what were they afraid of?\n\nJohn McCain told Politico, \u201cI saw the letter, I saw that it looked reasonable to me and I signed it, that\u2019s all. I sign lots of letters\u201d\u2014as if he didn\u2019t have to worry about anyone actually reading them. McCain told Greta Van Susteren, of Fox, that the Iranians needed to know that Congress had a serious role, but conceded, with what might be taken as a hint of regret, that the letter \u201cmaybe \u2026 wasn\u2019t the best way to do that.\u201d Bobby Jindal, the governor of Louisiana, said that he wished that he could sign Cotton\u2019s letter and that he hoped that other potential 2016 Presidential candidates would, too. Senators Rand Paul, Marco Rubio, and Ted Cruz, of course, already have.\n\nCotton reportedly lobbied the senators personally and strenuously. And yet perhaps it wouldn\u2019t have taken much for someone to stop him. Corker, the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, declined to sign the letter because he had been trying to organize a bill that would undermine the Iran talks in a more dignified way. (\u201cI just don\u2019t view that as where I need to be today,\u201d he told Politico. \u201cMy goal is to get 67 or more people on something that will affect the outcome.\u201d) His fellow-Tennessean, Lamar Alexander, told the Knoxville News-Sentinel that he was guided by his colleague\u2019s expertise. Murkowski\u2019s spokesman noted that she was co-sponsoring the Corker bill. It may be relevant that, last year, Thad Cochran, though by traditional measures an archconservative, was targetted by Tea Partiers during a bitter campaign that involved a break-in at his wife\u2019s nursing home and a suicide. Then again, the non-signers might just have had a sensible conversation on the subject before saying yes. If that were the case, perhaps it\u2019s no surprise that so many others signed. The odds of having a chance encounter with rationality in today\u2019s Senate are vanishingly small.", "article_metadata": {"cache-version": 20160526204643, "description": "How did a freshman senator with a well-known habit of engaging in flights of destructive rhetoric get forty-six colleagues to sign his letter to Iran?", "account-url": "https://account.newyorker.com", "wp-parsely_version": "1.7", "og": {"site_name": "The New Yorker", "description": "How did a freshman senator with a well-known habit of engaging in flights of destructive rhetoric get forty-six colleagues to sign his letter to Iran?", "title": "Senator Tom Cotton\u2019s Influence on the Republican Party - The New Yorker", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://www.newyorker.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Davidson-Tom-Cotton-1200-630-12114530.jpg", "height": 630}, "updated_time": "2015-03-12T14:04:20-04:00", "url": "http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/tom-cotton-iran-letter", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "How did a freshman senator with a well-known habit of engaging in flights of destructive rhetoric get forty-six colleagues to sign his letter to Iran?", "creator": "@tnyCloseRead", "image": "http://www.newyorker.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Davidson-Tom-Cotton-1200-630-12114530.jpg", "title": "Senator Tom Cotton\u2019s Influence on the Republican Party - The New Yorker", "site": "@newyorker", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "The New Yorker", "robots": "noodp", "parsely-metadata": "{\"id\":\"3010361\",\"title_alt\":\"Tom Cotton\\u2019s Influence\",\"featured_image_url\":\"http:\\/\\/www.newyorker.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2015\\/03\\/Davidson-Tom-Cotton-728-375-12151426.jpg\"}", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "environment": "prod", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1081530898", "fb": {"admins": 757909316}, "article": {"section": "Amy Davidson", "tag": "Tom Cotton", "published_time": "2015-03-12T12:35:58-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-03-12T14:04:20-04:00"}, "google-site-verification": "_jvLA9pRQom0-f6587wRKrNwfRtqyKzjfYWvwcZ5fxc", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "id": 3010361, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=0", "news_keywords": "Arkansas, Foreign Policy, Iran, Israel, John McCain, Politics, President Barack Obama, Republicans, Tom Cotton"}, "article_summary": "Maybe they just didn\u2019t think that the Republican Party had become quite so lacking in leadership.\nCorker was one of only seven Republican senators who didn\u2019t.\n\u201cI just didn\u2019t think it was appropriate\u201d (Flake).\nHe was talking about the letter \u201cto the Leaders of the Islamic Republic of Iran\u201d that had been signed by forty-seven Republican senators, including Tom Cotton, of Arkansas, who led the effort.\nCotton\u2019s recommendation was that the prisoners should \u201crot in hell.\u201dSomething seems to be out of kilter in the political marketplace that yielded Tom Cotton."}
