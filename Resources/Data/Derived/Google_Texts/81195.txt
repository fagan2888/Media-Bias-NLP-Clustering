MADRID (Reuters) - Belgian Kris Boeckmans is in an induced coma after crashing on the eighth stage of the Tour of Spain on Saturday, a 182.5-km ride from Puebla de Don Fadrique to Murcia.

"Kris Boeckmans has a severe facial trauma with several fractures and will probably need surgery," his Belgian team Lotto-Soudal said on their Twitter feed.

"He has concussion, 3 broken ribs and bleeding in his lung. He is now being kept in an induced coma for a few days."

Boeckmans was one of several riders to crash with about 50-km left in the stage won by Belgian Jasper Stuyven of the Trek Factory team.
