But proving that a picture is worth a thousand books, the \u201cselfie\u201d seen \u2019round the world ends the argument.\n\nIt\u2019s official \u2014 the government of the United States of Obama consists of boobs and bores and is led by a narcissist. It is no consolation that Great Britain joins us in racing to the bottom.\n\nPresident Obama\u2019s flirting with Denmark\u2019s prime minister would be shameful on any occasion. That it happened at the memorial for Nelson Mandela only adds to the embarrassment.\n\nBut the \u201cselfie\u201d episode also symbolizes the greater global calamity of Western decline. With British prime minister David Cameron playing the role of Obama\u2019s giggling wingman, the \u201clook at me\u201d moment confirms we have unserious leaders in a dangerously serious time.\n\nIran marches toward nuclear weapons and already there is talk in military circles that a nuclear-armed Iran could mean mushroom clouds in the Mideast within five years.\n\nChina is flexing its muscles throughout Asia, its ships brazenly confronting ours on the high seas. Russia is expanding its writ in the Arab lands and in Eastern Europe while making casual threats about bombing America. Syria\u2019s Assad uses chemical weapons and Obama and Cameron rattle little sabers before meekly agreeing to become his partner.\n\nThe sign-language interpreter wasn\u2019t the only fake at the Mandela funeral. Obama and Cameron were posing as world leaders.\n\nThey will never be confused with FDR and Churchill. The fratboys stand in stark contrast to the days when the \u201cspecial relationship\u201d meant two great leaders uniting two great countries in the fight for freedom. Those leaders understood the consequences if evil prevailed and were committed to victory.\n\nChurchill coined the term \u201cspecial relationship\u201d during World War II and used it again in his \u201cIron Curtain Speech\u201d in 1946 that marked the unofficial start of the Cold War. Fearful the West would disarm again, as it did after World War I, he wanted to combat communism by maintaining the \u201cspecial relationship between the British Commonwealth and Empire and the United States.\u201d\n\nTo him it meant our \u201ckindred systems of society\u201d must grow ever closer to provide mutual security and a framework for global peace. That special bond later cemented the Ronald Reagan-Margaret Thatcher partnership that led to the collapse of the Soviet Union.\n\nTry to imagine any of those four embarrassing their nations by acting like indulgent teenagers while civilization hung in the balance. You can\u2019t because they wouldn\u2019t.\n\nHitler\u2019s greatest mistake was being born too soon. If he were on the march now, would there be will in Washington and London to stop him? Would there be an arsenal of democracy to save mankind from darkness?\n\nIn fact, while Obama and Cameron were yukking it up in South Africa, the White House was denouncing bipartisan efforts in Congress to pass more sanctions against Iran. Doing so, it said, would scuttle the feeble interim deal Obama and Cameron accepted. Incredibly, administration arguments echoed Iran\u2019s position.\n\nTry to imagine FDR and Churchill siding with Hitler against their national legislatures. You can\u2019t because they were the antitheses of the appeasers of their times.\n\nWorld War II proved that the international order collapses when there is no one to support and enforce it. Obama himself has said that, but apparently believes talk is sufficient.\n\nCameron also talks a good game, but hollowed out the British military to where it is no longer capable of sustained missions.\n\nWords don\u2019t matter to tyrants and genocidal maniacs. They push until they are convinced there will be consequences if they go further.\n\nOur weakness invites their aggression and makes war more likely, not less. That is the perilous state of the world, as the clown kings of the West party on.\n\nSeeking fools for NYC schools\n\nBill de Blasio is having a hard time getting to yes. Depending on who is counting, as many as three people have turned down an offer to be the new schools chancellor.\n\nThe latest \u201cthanks, but no thanks\u201d came from Washington, DC, Chancellor Kaya Henderson. In a letter to her staff squashing rumors she was coming to Gotham, Henderson wrote, \u201cI love DC and I\u2019m not about to leave.\u201d\n\nThe mayor-elect should take a hint. Namely, the job isn\u2019t attractive because his agenda aims mostly to keep unions happy. In big ways, that puts de Blasio on the opposite side of the national reform movement, which supports merit pay and teacher evaluations based on student performance.\n\nInstead, the Democrat campaigned on a platform that only opposed things Mayor Bloomberg favors. Because Bloomberg is for charters, de Blasio is against them. Bloomberg closes failing schools, so de Blasio will keep them open. He never actually says how he will improve results.\n\nIt\u2019s no coincidence de Blasio\u2019s positions line up with the United Federation of Teachers. None of his ideas will help kids learn, but they will keep the union off his back.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t make the job attractive to successful educators. Nor does de Blasio\u2019s push for universal pre-kindergarten if it means protracted political fights over a tax increase. Even if Dollar Bill gets his hike, a new chancellor will face years of classroom squeezes to make room for pre-K students.\n\nEarly on, there was talk de Blasio would offer the job to Randi Weingarten, the former head of the UFT who now leads the national union. I don\u2019t think she wants it, but her appointment would have the advantage of honesty. It would make it crystal clear the union is the boss.\n\nExecuting the truth\n\nGeorge Orwell lives! Stories about North Korea\u2019s execution of the uncle of Kim Jong-un mention various agencies whose names are the opposite of their real function. There is the ruling Workers\u2019 Party, the Ministry of State Security and, my favorite, the Ministry of People\u2019s Security.\n\nBut who are we to laugh? America has the Affordable Care Act.\n\nHue turn on liberal guilt\n\nThe confession by a former Brooklyn judge that he convicted a white man of murder in 1999 because of his own bias could help end the scourge of liberal guilt. Ex-jurist Frank Barbaro, who is also white, is trying to help free a man he says was innocent.\n\nHopefully, federal Judge Shira Scheindlin is watching. Her smear of Ray Kelly and the NYPD over stop-and-frisk is a classic example of liberal judges trying to remake society to fit their personal prejudices. The city awaits her apology.\n\nTimes\u2019 \u2018prize\u2019 idiots\n\nSafest bet of the season: The New York Times will nominate its interminable series on a dysfunctional homeless family for a Pulitzer.
