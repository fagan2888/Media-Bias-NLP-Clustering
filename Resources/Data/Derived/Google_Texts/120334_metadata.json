Mules pulling canalboats walked on the towpath - hence the name.\n\nBy the middle of the 19th century, the canal system had been abandoned. The state has filled in most portions, but stretches of water remain in Montgomery County and in Manayunk.\n\nThe canal is \"a crown jewel of this part of the county,\" said State Rep. Mike Vereb (R., Montgomery).\n\nThe $1.8-million, two-phase project to create the towpath has spanned the governorships of both Tom Corbett and Tom Wolf, as well as two county administrations.\n\nThe state Department of Conservation and Natural Resources and the William Penn Foundation provided funding above the county's $1.3 million.\n\n\"It's not every day when you get your county leadership, state leadership, local leadership, everybody - forgive the pun - rowing in the same direction,\" Shapiro said.\n\njmcdaniel@philly.com\n\n610-313-8205\n\n@McDanielJustine", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "news", "og": {"url": "http://articles.philly.com/2015-07-30/news/65001374_1_montgomery-county-county-leadership-schuylkill-county", "site_name": "philly-archives", "type": "article", "description": "As cyclists whizzed past and kayakers drifted below the bridge on a hot summer afternoon, the final link in the Schuylkill River Trail connecting Philadelphia to Phoenixville officially opened.
