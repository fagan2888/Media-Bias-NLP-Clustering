CUMMING — Members of local chapters of the Sons and Daughters of the American Revolution have joined forces with a home improvement store to properly retire national flags.

The Home Depot on Market Place Boulevard was the site of an American flag retirement ceremony held, appropriately enough, on Flag Day, which was June 14.

The ceremony also served to unveil a new, one-of-a-kind flag collection receptacle that is inside the Home Depot location.

Chris Coleman, merchandising execution manager of the Cumming store, called the event “more than a flag ceremony.”

Rather, he said, it was “the genesis of a partnership between a collection of institutions that take pride in serving our communities.”

“It is our collective hope that the dedication of this beautiful flag receptacle here today will be the beginning of a nationwide relationship between these parties to honor our service men and women, and shine a light on a symbol of hope, opportunity and freedom — our nation’s flag.”

Taking part in the event were members of the Robert Forsyth Chapter of the Sons of the American Revolution, Martha Stewart Bulloch Chapter of Daughters of the American Revolution and Boy Scout Troop 1099.

Staff Sgt. David A. Thompson with the Army National Guard placed the first ceremonial flag into the receptacle for proper disposal.

Allen Greenly, president of the Robert Forsyth SAR chapter, said the event marked “the beginning of a long partnership between the civic groups and the Home Depot to provide a much needed service to the public.”

Coleman said anyone who brings in an American flag for disposal in the unit and then buys a new flag will receive a discount on it.
