And what do we do if those laws are unconstitutional? Well apparently nine precogs in magic robes got together, looked at the Affordable Care Act, and decided that it was not unconstitutional. So everything appears to have been done literally by the book. This bill is now a law, vetted by the very system these Republicans claim to love \u2014 but to hear Republicans tell it, the whole thing could just be avoided if President Obama would just meet him halfway! The bill is a fucking law! Are you familiar with how the word works? Did you see the Giants game on Sunday? Okay: they lost 31 to 7. And you know what the Giants didn\u2019t say after that game? \u2018If you don\u2019t give us 25 more points by midnight on Monday, we are gonna shut down the NFL!\u2019\n\nWATCH HERE:\n\nStewart continued his assault on the \u201cRepublican Morons\u201d Tuesday night and even turned his irritation to the idiotic Fox News network, saying directly to them \u201cF**K YOU!!!\u201d in response to their nonchalant attitude towards the shutdown and how it affects people.\n\nWATCH HERE:\n\nAnd on Wednesday night, just one hour before the third day of the \u201cShutstorm 2013,\u201d Jon called Republicans \u201cself-righteous Orwellian zebra queefs\u201d and called \u201cbullshit\u201d on their claims that the Democrats are to blame, telling them to \u201cstop trying to photo-op your way out of responsibility for this catastrophe.\u201d\n\nWATCH HERE:\n\nThis guy is on a roll!", "article_metadata": {"generator": "Powered by Visual Composer - drag and drop page builder for WordPress.", "author": "The Master Chief", "og": {"site_name": "Gossip On This", "description": "Our favorite person on TV Jon Stewart has been letting the Republicans HAVE IT all week on the \u201cDaily Show.\u201d After a three-month absence, Jon Stewart returned to television earlier this month, and just in time too.
