Here at PolitiFact, we\u2019ve been following contests in several states.\n\nIn an earlier report, we looked at the race in Georgia for the Republican nomination for U.S. Senate. Here are some of our fact-checks looking at political contests in Kentucky, Oregon and Idaho.\n\nMcConnell vs. Bevin in Kentucky\n\nGun rights. Tea party-backed candidate Matt Bevin is challenging Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky. One of his main lines of attack is that McConnell isn\u2019t sufficiently conservative, and specifically Bevin has attacked McConnell on not supporting gun rights strongly enough.\n\n\"Mitch McConnell voted with Harry Reid to infringe on our gun rights,\" a February RV ad said. \"Matt Bevin always support the Second Amendment. The choice is clear.\"\n\nWhen we dug into the evidence on this, we found one vote McConnell took more than 22 years ago on a massive crime bill that included dozens of procedural votes and amendments and didn\u2019t even pass Congress. Bevin\u2019s team pointed to a few these procedural votes as their evidence. The law failed, though, with McConnell voting against it, and Reid voting for it. Much more recently, McConnell held his caucus firmly together against attempts to restrict and regulate gun purchases after the December 2012 Connecticut school shooting at Newtown. Bevin\u2019s claim struck us as so flimsy we rated the statement Pants on Fire .\n\nThe Wall Street bailout. Bevin made a more accurate claim with this attack from a TV ad: \"After pushing the Wall Street bailout through the U.S. Senate, Mitch McConnell bragged, \u2018This has been the Senate at its finest.\u2019 \" We found that McConnell actively supported emergency government intervention in the financial markets and spoke openly of playing a key role in crafting compromise legislation when President George W. Bush held the White House. However, to say that he pushed the bill through the Senate downplays the role of the Republican president and the party\u2019s presidential nominee, who also pressed to get the measure passed. The ad ignores that in January 2009, there was a second bailout funding vote and on that one, McConnell voted no. Overall, we rated Bevin\u2019s claim Mostly True .\n\nBevin\u2019s tax history. In an ad from McConnell attacking Bevin, McConnell\u2019s campaign said that Bevin repeatedly failed to pay his taxes. \"Bevin\u2019s business failed to pay taxes at least eight times. And was the No. 1 tax delinquent,\" the ad said, before questioning Bevin\u2019s honesty in comments about the matter. We found a lot more to the story than the ad suggests. The business that Bevin managed was in financial trouble before he took control, and local authorities actually credited him with helping the firm pay its tax bills and later, keeping the business afloat. We rated the claim Mostly False .\n\nCockfighting. We couldn\u2019t resist checking into a more light-hearted claim from Bevin about cockfighting. In a radio interview, Bevin said the nation\u2019s Founding Fathers were fans of watching roosters in battle. \"But it's interesting, when you look at cockfighting and dogfighting as well, this isn't something new, it wasn't invented in Kentucky for example,\" Bevin said. \"I mean, the founding fathers were all -- many of them -- very actively involved in this and always had been.\"\n\nThere is one reference in George Washington\u2019s diaries that confirms that as a 19-year-old, the nation\u2019s future first president attended a cockfight. But he left before it was even over. In looking at the other prominent founders, we found no indications that they were avid and frequent participants. We rated the claim False .\n\nMoney from lobbyists. If McConnell wins, he\u2019ll face Alison Lundergan Grimes, the Democratic Kentucky Secretary of State, in November. In a campaign email to supporters, she charged that McConnell is \"the No. 1 recipient of contributions from lobbyists this cycle.\" Based on the analysis from Open Secrets, McConnell tops the chart for 2014. That\u2019s probably a perk of his party position more than anything. We rated the statement True .\n\nA Pants on Fire in Oregon\n\nUnemployment benefits. In Oregon, Republican candidates Monica Wehby and Jason Conger are vying to take on Democratic U.S. Sen. Jeff Merkley in November\u2019s general election. Conger is a second-term state legislator from Bend, while Wehby is a Portland pediatric neurosurgeon. The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee attacked both candidates for failing to support extensions of unemployment benefits.\n\n\"Monica Wehby and Jason Conger\u2019s reckless refusal to support the renewal of unemployment benefits is causing devastating consequences for nearly 23,000 Oregonians looking for work and hurting the state\u2019s economy more each day,\" the committee said in a press release.\n\nConger opposed the extension of benefits, while Wehby said she would support a temporary measure if money could be found to pay for it. More critically, the claims ignores the fact that neither is in a position to cast a vote on the issue, let alone cause \"devastating consequences\" for Oregonians. Even if one is elected to the Senate, he or she won\u2019t be sworn in for nearly a year. We rated this over-the-top accusation as Pants on Fire .\n\nMixing it up in Idaho\n\nThat wacky debate for governor. A recent gubernatorial debate in Boise attracted national attention for some of the rambling and weird statements from lower-profile candidates. (Like this one: \"I'm about as politically correct as your proverbial turd in a punch bowl.\") One serious claim we looked at was this: \"Idaho was the only Republican-led state in the nation that chose to partner with President Obama\" by creating a state-based marketplace under the Affordable Care Act, said state Sen. Russ Fulcher.\n\nWhile most states with a Republican governor did refuse to create their own state-run marketplace, Idaho was not the only one. Four other states with Republican governors also created a marketplace that was either fully state-run or was a partnership between the federal government and the state. We rated Fulcher\u2019s claim False .\n\nPelosi\u2019s role in an Idaho GOP House race. In a tea party vs. establishment primary battle, eight-term Rep. Mike Simpson, R-Idaho, faces a primary challenge from attorney Bryan Smith. For the super PACs supporting Simpson and Smith, the air wars over the past month have focused to an odd degree on Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic minority leader and a liberal Californian.\n\nThe Madison Action Fund, which supports Smith, attacked Simpson for being liberal.\"Simpson voted with Nancy Pelosi to bail out Wall Street,\" the ad claimed. \"That wasnt enough spending for Mike Simpson, so he joined Pelosi in voting to take more of your money to fund sex study programs of San Francisco prostitutes. Simpson also joined Pelosi in voting to regulate the sale of firearms.\"\n\nWe compared Simpson\u2019s voting record to Pelosi\u2019s and found that they\u2019ve only voted together 29 percent of the time. Even Rep. Michele Bachmann, R-Minn. -- nobody\u2019s idea of a liberal -- voted with Pelosi 24 percent of the time. The rest of the votes are from more than a decade ago and mischaracterized the bills in question. We awarded the ad a rating of Pants on Fire .\n\nMeanwhile, the ad by the group Defending Main Street, which supports Simpson, noted that Smith is supported by the Club for Growth; it features a clip of Club for Growth president Chris Chocola speaking positively of Pelosi. \"The person I respect the most in Washington might surprise you: It\u2019s Nancy Pelosi,\" Chocola said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "It&rsquo;s primary day in several states, with voters going to the polls to pick party nominees to head on to November&rsquo;s general election.
