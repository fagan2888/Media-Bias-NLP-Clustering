Thousands are outraged at the limited mainstream media coverage after a group of armed activists took over a federal wildlife refuge in Burns, Oregon on Saturday evening.

The armed protesters are accusing Oregon officials of treating ranchers, who refused to sell their land, unfairly. In the video above, Ammon Bundy – a son of a rancher – made an announcement to the general public in hopes of recruiting supporters.

Bundy is heard saying: “We’re doing this so the people can have their land and their resources back where they belong. We’re calling people to come and stand. We need you to bring your arms and we need you to come to the Malheur National Wildlife refuge.“

Since the incident, #OregonUnderAttack has become a popular trend across all social media platforms, but because there has been little mainstream coverage, many feel this is another act of “white terrorism” going unnoticed.

What's the difference between a terrorist cell and a militia? Religion and skin colour, apparently. #OregonUnderAttack — Brian G. Rice (@bgrice) January 3, 2016

Pay close attention to what mass media decides to cover – and "how" they cover it. It matters #OregonUnderAttack — Kim Kane (@KimKane1) January 3, 2016

As of this morning, the story has gained greater attention among mainstream media, while the sheriff’s office promised “a collective effort from multiple agencies,” this according to Independent.
