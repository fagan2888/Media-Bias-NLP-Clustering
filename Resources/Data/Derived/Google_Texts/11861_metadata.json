From 2011 to 2013, that number grew to 22 percent.\n\nThe morning-after pill is easily accessible since no prescription is required, and in 2013, the 18-year-old age limit required to purchase the pill was eliminated.\n\nAccording to Bill Albert, chief program officer for The National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy, this study is indicative that \u201cteens, like adults, often are not very good at contraception,\u201d given the increased usage rates once the age limit was lifted.\n\nUnlike regular birth control, the morning-after pill contains a higher dose of the female hormone progestin. As a result, if the drug is consumed within 72 hours of unprotected sex, chances of pregnancy are reduced by nearly 90 percent.\n\nBut despite these higher rates in emergency contraception, the study indicated a decline over the past 25 years of sexually active teens aged 15 to 19. Currently, about 45 percent of teens are sexually active, leveling out to a 14-percent decline in females and a 22-percent decline in males.\n\nExperts attribute these declining rates to larger awareness concerning AIDS and sexually transmitted diseases, along with increased levels of sex education.\n\nThe report was conducted by interviewing a sample of about 2,000 individuals aged 15 to 19 from 2011 to 2013.", "article_metadata": {"description": "More than 20 percent of teenage girls have used the morning-after pill, according to a study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "More than 20 percent of teenage girls have used the morning-after pill, according to a study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.", "title": "Study: Increased Rate of Teenage Girls Use Morning-After Pill", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150722_EmergencyContraception_Stancy.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-07-29T10:02:09+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1gQVMHF"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "More than 20 percent of teenage girls have used the morning-after pill, according to a study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.", "creator": "@dailysignal", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150722_EmergencyContraception_Stancy.jpg"}, "title": "Study: Increased Rate of Teenage Girls Use Morning-After Pill", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Society", "tag": "public health", "published_time": "2015-07-27T17:41:02+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-07-29T10:02:09+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Morning-after pill, Center for Disease Control, Unplanned Pregnancy"}, "article_summary": "An increased number of teenage girls\u2014more than 20 percent\u2014have used the morning-after pill, according to a new study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nSince 2002, the number of teenagers who have used the morning-after pill increased from 8 percent to 14 percent from 2006 to 2010.\nThe morning-after pill is easily accessible since no prescription is required, and in 2013, the 18-year-old age limit required to purchase the pill was eliminated.\nUnlike regular birth control, the morning-after pill contains a higher dose of the female hormone progestin.\nExperts attribute these declining rates to larger awareness concerning AIDS and sexually transmitted diseases, along with increased levels of sex education."}
