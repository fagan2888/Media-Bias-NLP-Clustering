LITTLE ROCK — The Medicaid expansion program known as the private option is projected to have a positive impact on the state budget of $438 million between 2017 and 2021, according to a preliminary report by a consulting firm hired by state legislators.

The report by The Stephen Group is scheduled to be discussed at a joint meeting Wednesday of the Health Reform Legislative Task Force and the Governor’s Advisory Council on Medicaid Reform. Under its contract with the task force on health reform, The Stephen Group is required to present a final report by Oct. 1.

The private option is Arkansas’ alternative to the Medicaid expansion that was envisioned under the federal Affordable Care Act. Since January 2014, it has used federal Medicaid money to subsidize private health insurance for more than 200,000 Arkansans earning up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level.

The federal government is paying 100 percent of the cost of the program, but in 2017, Arkansas will begin paying 5 percent of the cost, with its share increasing gradually to 10 percent by 2020.

The Legislature voted this year to end the program at the end of 2016. The task force on health reform is looking for possible alternatives to the program and for ways to reform traditional Medicaid.

Sen. Jim Hendren, R-Gravette, co-chairman of the task force on health reform, said Tuesday of the report, “It is good news in the sense that the state budget may not be in as much peril as was originally feared when the 10 percent match kicks in.”

Hendren added, “For many people, though, the issue is not just one of the state budget. It’s also one of the overall spending and philosophy.”

Gov. Asa Hutchinson is scheduled to speak Wednesday to the panels that will be taking up the report. He said Tuesday when asked about the report, “Let me wait and comment on that tomorrow.”
