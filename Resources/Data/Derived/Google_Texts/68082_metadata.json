Vicky Hartzler, R-Missouri, said in a video released Saturday. \"If this bill becomes law, patients will be able to choose a health insurance plan that works for them -- without Washington getting in the way.\"\n\nThe Missouri Republican, who sits on the House Budget Committee, points to rising health insurance costs as a reason to target the individual mandate of the Affordable Care Act (ACA).\n\nObamacare \"forces people to buy insurance that's much more expensive than what they need,\" Hartzler said. \"And when you force millions of people to buy expensive and unaffordable insurance, it's not that surprising to see premiums going up. Deductibles are going up too -- all while people's choices are disappearing.\"\n\nHartzler promised that the bill, which would eliminate the individual mandate as well as the employer mandate to offer insurance, would be sent directly to the president's desk via the reconciliation process, avoiding the chance of congressional Democrats filibustering the legislation.\n\nThe bill also takes aim at federal funding for Planned Parenthood -- a fight Republicans have renewed with vigor since last summer, when an anti-abortion group released undercover videos of Planned Parenthood employees discussing controversial procedures like fetal tissue transfers.\n\nAccording to Hartzler, the legislation places a \"moratorium on taxpayer funding to abortion providers\" for one year and uses some of that money to fund other community health centers.\n\n\"We have taken many votes to preserve health care choices and protect precious tax dollars in the House,\" she said. \"If the president didn't hear the people's voices earlier, hopefully, he will through this bill.\"\n\nThe Senate passed similar legislation last month, narrowly voting through a bill crafted under the budget reconciliation process that repeals major parts of the ACA.\n\nThe Missouri representative also added a message for the people of her state, extending her thoughts and prayers to those affected by severe weather events over the last week.\n\n\"Missouri is experiencing extensive flooding as are other states. Families across the South are picking up the pieces of their lives after being devastated by tornadoes. Ice and snow have caused power outages in multiple states. It wasn't the holiday week we were expecting, but there is help,\" Hartzler said. \"If you are affected, I urge you to reach out to your U.S. representative's office, state and local authorities, or the federal and state emergency management agencies for resources to deal with the aftermath. While the assistance can't undo the damage, it can help get you on a path to recovery so 2016 can be a new year with new hope.\"", "article_metadata": {"description": "House Republicans will start off 2016 with renewed legislative push to roll back the Affordable Care Act", "og": {"url": "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/gop-promises-house-vote-to-repeal-obamacare-defund-planned-parenthood/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2016/01/02/ac5cedfc-ce2c-4bc4-8e19-63f5a7f95ba2/thumbnail/1200x630/b0df4f8fc5c7eaa7a97d8ee4829a6498/politicsgop010215.jpg", "height": 630}, "type": "article", "description": "House Republicans will start off 2016 with renewed legislative push to roll back the Affordable Care Act", "title": "GOP promises House vote to repeal Obamacare, defund Planned Parenthood"}, "twitter": {"description": "House Republicans will start off 2016 with renewed legislative push to roll back the Affordable Care Act", "title": "GOP promises House vote to repeal Obamacare, defund Planned Parenthood", "app": {"url": {"ipad": "cbsnewsapp://news/gop-promises-house-vote-to-repeal-obamacare-defund-planned-parenthood/", "iphone": "cbsnewsapp://news/gop-promises-house-vote-to-repeal-obamacare-defund-planned-parenthood/", "googleplay": "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/gop-promises-house-vote-to-repeal-obamacare-defund-planned-parenthood/"}, "country": "US", "name": {"ipad": "CBS News", "iphone": "CBS News", "googleplay": "CBS News"}, "id": {"ipad": 334256223, "iphone": 334256223, "googleplay": "com.treemolabs.apps.cbsnews"}}, "site": "@CBSPolitics", "image": "http://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2016/01/02/ac5cedfc-ce2c-4bc4-8e19-63f5a7f95ba2/thumbnail/1200x630/b0df4f8fc5c7eaa7a97d8ee4829a6498/politicsgop010215.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "al": {"web": {"url": "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/gop-promises-house-vote-to-repeal-obamacare-defund-planned-parenthood/"}, "android": {"app_name": "CBS News", "package": "com.treemolabs.apps.cbsnews"}, "ios": {"url": "cbsnewsapp://news/gop-promises-house-vote-to-repeal-obamacare-defund-planned-parenthood/", "app_name": "CBS News", "app_store_id": 334256223}}, "robots": "index, follow", "fb": {"app_id": 1536620209892267}, "keywords": "obamacare, affordable care act, planned parenthood, gop address", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/CBSPolitics"}, "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "obamacare, affordable care act, planned parenthood, gop address"}, "article_summary": "The bill also takes aim at federal funding for Planned Parenthood -- a fight Republicans have renewed with vigor since last summer, when an anti-abortion group released undercover videos of Planned Parenthood employees discussing controversial procedures like fetal tissue transfers.\nHouse Republicans are starting off 2016 with a renewed legislative push to roll back the president's landmark health care legislation, with proposals to defund Planned Parenthood tacked onto the bill.\n\"If this bill becomes law, patients will be able to choose a health insurance plan that works for them -- without Washington getting in the way.\"\n\"We have taken many votes to preserve health care choices and protect precious tax dollars in the House,\" she said.\nThe Missouri Republican, who sits on the House Budget Committee, points to rising health insurance costs as a reason to target the individual mandate of the Affordable Care Act (ACA)."}
