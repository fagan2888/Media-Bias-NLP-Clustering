Van Taylor\u2019s seat all support gun rights and reducing taxes, and they oppose Obamacare and abortion-rights measures.\n\nTechnology executive Matt Shaheen, 48, who was a Collin County commissioner for almost five years before resigning in December to run for state office, is the only candidate who has served in an elected position.\n\nBut the two political newcomers in the race \u2014 Glenn Callison and Stacy Chen \u2014 are quick to distinguish themselves from career politicians. Callison, 50, a commercial real estate attorney and partner at a Dallas firm, has lived in Plano for 25 years. Chen, a 27-year-old teaching assistant at the University of Texas at Dallas, said her educational background separates her from her competitors and will allow her to bring creative solutions to the table.\n\nShaheen and Chen align closely with Taylor, though Shaheen said he disagreed with Taylor\u2019s stance against drawing money from the rainy day fund for the state\u2019s water projects. Taylor was one of two representatives who voted against a bill to add $2 billion to the projects.\n\nTaylor in Senate race\n\nTaylor has represented the district that includes most of West Plano and parts of Far North Dallas since 2010. He\u2019s leaving to run for the seat being vacated by attorney general hopeful Sen. Ken Paxton, R-McKinney.\n\nThere is no Democratic opponent. The Republican candidate will face Libertarian Ian Santorella.\n\nAt the top of the priority list for the three candidates is reassessing the education funding formula. In November, Plano voters approved a property tax hike to boost school funding. The district faced a $20 million shortfall for the school year after the 2011 Legislature slashed funding for public education. Only 29 percent of funding was restored to Plano in 2013, compared with the state average of about 77 percent.\n\n\u201cWe have to make sure we have quality education that prepares people,\u201d Callison said. \u201cI don\u2019t believe just increasing the funding is the answer.\u201d\n\nShaheen said that too many decisions are made in Austin and Washington, D.C., and pointed to the need for local control.\n\n\u201cOur children are better off if our teachers, parents and school boards make more decisions with respect to education,\u201d he said.\n\nInstead of throwing additional dollars at the issue of transportation, the candidates agreed about the need to reallocate existing funds. The Texas Department of Transportation has said the $1.2 billion that could be approved for highway spending is only a fraction of what\u2019s needed. Callison and Shaheen said the roads are underfunded\n\nA self-described \u201cliberty conservative\u201d and \u201cconstitutional Republican,\u201d Chen credits Ron Paul with shaping her conservative values. Chen was an alternate delegate at the Republican National Convention in Tampa, Fla., where she said she realized how far the country had strayed from \u201cwhat the founding fathers intended in the Constitution.\u201d\n\nIf elected, Chen would be one of the youngest people to serve in the House. But she said the district needs someone who isn\u2019t complacent and is willing to stand up and fight for liberty.\n\n\u201cA lot of representatives are older, but nothing seems to be getting better,\u201d she said.\n\nHealth care issue\n\nChen said the Affordable Care Act is a bailout for the health care industry that infringes on personal choice.\n\nShaheen has been working with the Texas Public Policy Foundation, a conservative think tank, to develop legislation for a \u201cconservative free-market approach to health care\u201d that would give tax incentives to doctors who voluntarily donate time to those who are in need in the community.\n\nTouting his political experience, Shaheen said the county commissioners lowered taxes three times and fully funded the county\u2019s pension during his tenure.\n\nCallison touts his 20 years at a local law firm and dubs himself a \u201ccommon-sense, solutions-oriented\u201d leader. He said he understands what it takes to balance a budget and create jobs.\n\n\u201cPeople can be so tied up in their ideological positions, they forget the reason people elect them is not to espouse ideals \u2026 but to find solutions,\u201d Callison said.\n\nIt\u2019s a position he shares with former state Sen. Florence Shapiro and Brian McCall, chancellor of the Texas State University System and a former representative, whom he counts among his supporters.\n\nCampaign coffers\n\nAccording to the latest campaign finance reports, Callison has more than $63,000 cash on hand and $25,000 in outstanding loans. He\u2019s supported by the Texas Medical Association and Texas Association of Realtors political action committees.\n\nShaheen has more than $413,000 cash on hand, and $485,000 in outstanding loans. He is endorsed by the North Texas Tea Party.\n\nAmong his donors he counts Reps. Bryan Hughes, R-Mineola, and Bill Zedler, R-Arlington, and the new conservative Accountability First PAC, from which he has received a little over $10,000.\n\nSome critics say the PAC\u2019s goal is to oust House Speaker Joe Straus. Shaheen said he believes Rep. Scott Turner, R-Frisco, would be a good leader for the House and \u201ca strong representative for the Republican party at a national level.\u201d\n\nChen, whose finance reports were not available online, said she has raised about $4,000. She has an A+ rating from the nonprofit Texans Uniting for Reform and Freedom.\n\nFollow Claire Cardona on Twitter @ClaireZCardona.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Candidates for Texas House District 66 have similar views on bedrock issues, but they differ in level of experience and background.", "og": {"description": "Candidates for Texas House District 66 have similar views on bedrock issues, but they differ in level of experience and background.", "title": "3 conservatives vying for Plano Rep.
