She simply can\u2019t be in her line of work. As a film actress she gives over the top performances, most of these which poke fun at her weight. To say that McCarthy is an incredibly self-aware comedian is an understatement. After all she\u2019s living in an industry that rewards women who drop sizes and shun or shave down the waistlines of plus-sized actresses.\n\nMcCarthy in the same way that comedian Chris Farley did has made her weight service her comedy. That\u2019s not so say that she\u2019s promoting her choice of lifestyle, she\u2019s just embracing it.\n\nThe 43-year-old became frank during an interview with Rolling Stone when it was brought up that her career hinges on some unhealthy habits. McCarthy doesn\u2019t deny this fact and even admits that she could be a bit healthier.\n\n\u201cI could eat healthier, I could drink less. I should be learning another language and working out more, but I\u2019m just always saying, \u2018Ah, I could get hit by a bus tomorrow.\u201d\n\nAside from her weight Melissa McCarthy shines playing a myriad of characters who are all brash, witty and as subtle as a bull in a china shop. In one of her films she\u2019s actually referred to as a bull in a china shop. Most of these hilarious characters go on cursing tirades, which was hilariously showcased in Bridesmaids and The Heat.\n\nOf her raunchy characters, McCarthy, who currently stars in the new film Tammy, told Rolling Stone:\n\n\u201cI really truly didn\u2019t remember saying most of it.\u201d\n\nMcCarthy is often described as loud, bold and brash, and for the comedian there was definitely a switch that allowed her to channel in all of these qualities through her work. For the actress this happened during her rebellious teenage years, which included drinking and shoplifting.\n\n\u201cI turned slightly nuts. We\u2019d wrap sweaters around ourselves and walk out.\u201d\n\nSoon McCarthy will also add designer to her name as she plans to design plus figured clothes for women. She recently told People StyleWatch:\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re getting closer to starting a line. I hate to mention it now because people are going to say, \u2018You\u2019ve been talking about it for a year!\u2019 but it is getting closer. I\u2019m definitely excited!\u201d\n\nAs for her film career it doesn\u2019t look like McCarthy is slowing down anytime soon. In addition to Tammy, the star is rumored to co-star in The Heat 2, and has four projects in various stages of development.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Melissa McCarthy isn't stupid.
