(AP) - When the Oakland Raiders took the field for the start of their first full-team practice since the NFL draft, there was one notable spectator.\n\nQuarterback Derek Carr spent much of Tuesday\u2019s organized team activity on the sideline running plays in his mind instead of on the field as he deals with an undisclosed injury.\n\nCoach Jack Del Rio says it is his policy not to discuss injuries in the offseason and he would only say that Carr is one of a handful of players who could not take part in the practice.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t get into who has what and why and different timetables,\u201d Del Rio said. \u201cI don\u2019t get into that stuff this time of year. We\u2019re not going to sit here and play that game.\u201d\n\nCarr did take the field last month for a voluntary minicamp and has been with the team for the entire offseason program learning the new offense under coordinator Bill Musgrave.\n\nHe did not get the chance to practice with the team\u2019s top draft pick, receiver Amari Cooper, for the first time. But Del Rio did not seem concerned.\n\n\u201cTime missed in May is better than time missed in September, for sure,\u201d he said. \u201cIn fact, you\u2019re often capable of taking whatever time is necessary just to make sure you put things behind you. A little more cautious this time of year.\u201d\n\nDel Rio also did not seem concerned that practice time missed at this time of year would slow Carr\u2019s development or knowledge of the new up-tempo offense.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re just plodding ahead installing and working and doing what we can with the guys that are available,\u201d Del Rio said. \u201cThe guys that aren\u2019t, are working their best mentally through the process and taking all the mental reps they can.\u201d\n\nCarr started all 16 games in his rookie season and is being counted on to solidify the revolving door at quarterback that has plagued Oakland for the past decade.\n\nCarr was the 18th quarterback to start for Oakland since the beginning of 2003, but became the first to go all 16 games since Rich Gannon did it in 2002 - when the Raiders made the Super Bowl.\n\nCarr had good and bad moments during a three-win season for Oakland. He became the seventh rookie quarterback to throw for at least 3,000 yards and 20 touchdown passes in a season and looked comfortable in the pocket.\n\nHe also struggled at times against the blitz and was unable to get the ball downfield consistently, in part because of the lack of a game-breaking receiver.\n\nHis 5.46 yards per attempt were the lowest in the NFL and the second-worst mark ever posted by a Raiders quarterback, ahead of only JaMarcus Russell\u2019s 5.23 yards per attempt in 2009.\n\n___\n\nOnline:\n\nAP NFL website: www.pro32.ap.org and www.twitter.com/AP_NFL", "article_metadata": {"description": "When the Oakland Raiders took the field for the start of their first full-team practice since the NFL draft, there was one notable spectator.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "When the Oakland Raiders took the field for the start of their first full-team practice since the NFL draft, there was one notable spectator.", "title": "Raiders QB Derek Carr sidelined in offseason workouts", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/may/19/raiders-qb-derek-carr-sidelined-in-offseason-worko/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/05/19/b70e998a62f0f416760f6a706700ddfd.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/05/19/b70e998a62f0f416760f6a706700ddfd.jpg", "description": "When the Oakland Raiders took the field for the start of their first full-team practice since the NFL draft, there was one notable spectator.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Raiders QB Derek Carr sidelined in offseason workouts"}, "Author": "JOSH DUBOW", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9732\"", "article_summary": "\u201cWe\u2019re just plodding ahead installing and working and doing what we can with the guys that are available,\u201d Del Rio said.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t get into who has what and why and different timetables,\u201d Del Rio said.\nALAMEDA, Calif.
