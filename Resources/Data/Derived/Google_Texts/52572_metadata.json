Having health insurance is important to my family\u2019s economic security \u2014 it would be a financial disaster for us if I didn\u2019t have it \u2014 and it gives us the peace of mind to know that I can get the health care I need, when I need it.\n\nWhile the coverage it provides for unexpected illnesses and injuries is important, the coverage for contraceptive and reproductive health issues is absolutely critical for me to maintain my ability to be a working woman, wife and mother. And I\u2019m not alone: Many working women rely on health insurance to cover their health care needs, including family planning and maternity care so they can plan the size of their families and spacing of children to give the proper attention to both their homes and jobs.\n\nA pending court case in Colorado federal court and another in the 10th Circuit Court (serving Colorado, Oklahoma, Kansas, New Mexico, Wyoming and Utah) could put working women like me at risk of losing our all-important reproductive health care coverage.\n\nHercules Industries, a heating and air conditioning company based in Denver, alleges that the Affordable Care Act\u2019s requirement that family planning services be offered as an \u201cessential health benefit\u201d conflicts with the owners\u2019 religious preference to exclude these services for their women employees. The Hobby Lobby case in Oklahoma is almost identical.\n\nWorking women intimately understand that family planning isn\u2019t optional, extra or an \u201cadd-on\u201d health care service. It is truly essential for us to be able to balance the demands of our children, our partners and our workplace. While it\u2019s hard to believe that deeply personal decisions about reproductive health care could be decided in the courts instead of our doctor\u2019s offices, that\u2019s what\u2019s at stake.\n\nSo courts matter \u2014 and so do judges \u2014 since they have jurisdiction over some of the most fundamental elements of our lives. We deserve to have women who understand the real-world implications help decide cases dealing with women\u2019s reproductive health care. Yet according to the Federal Judicial Center, just 30 percent of all federal judges are women, and in Colorado only 27 percent are female.\n\nFor the Hercules and Hobby Lobby family planning cases, female judges are woefully absent. Senior Status Judge John Kane is presiding over the Hercules case, and while he is an honorable and upstanding jurist, it seems a woman might have a more direct understanding of what\u2019s at risk. And only two women out of 20 judges \u2014 just 10 percent \u2014 serve on the judicial bench in the 10th Circuit hearing the Hobby Lobby case.\n\nDue to the dysfunction in Washington, D.C., one out of 10 federal judgeships is vacant. Right now, our 10th Circuit has two vacancies for active judges, and while President Obama has nominated two women (Kansas Supreme Court Justice Nancy Moritz and Utah Court of Appeals Judge Carolyn B. McHugh), the U.S. Senate approval process is stalled.\n\nAs a working woman who depends on my employer-provided health insurance to cover reproductive health care, I call on the U.S. Senate to break through the gridlock to vote on these 10th Circuit Court nominees. Courts matter \u2014 and we need women like us deciding the cases that affect our families.\n\nPeg Perl is a wife, mother and lawyer who works for Colorado Ethics Watch.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "We need more female judges", "title": "We need more female judges", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2013/09/12/we-need-more-female-judges/", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20130912__20130915_D4_OP15G_PERLp1.jpg", "height": 458}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20130912__20130915_D4_OP15G_PERLp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2013-09-12T17:49:36+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-29T12:33:05+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Yet according to the Federal Judicial Center, just 30 percent of all federal judges are women, and in Colorado only 27 percent are female.\nWe deserve to have women who understand the real-world implications help decide cases dealing with women\u2019s reproductive health care.\nI have depended on my employer-provided health insurance for more than 12 years.\nWhile it\u2019s hard to believe that deeply personal decisions about reproductive health care could be decided in the courts instead of our doctor\u2019s offices, that\u2019s what\u2019s at stake.\nWorking women intimately understand that family planning isn\u2019t optional, extra or an \u201cadd-on\u201d health care service."}
