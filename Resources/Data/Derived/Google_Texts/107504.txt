Google “elevator fight” in search of yet more conspiracy theories about Solange’s pummeling of Jay Z, and you’ll see that the second result out of many thousands is the Facebook page of a now-defunct band that might, had it managed to stay together, have experienced quite a burst of accidental publicity.

Drummer Joe Baldacci told Salon that we were the first to remark upon the pop cultural coincidence of the band’s name, adding: “We all have moved on to other projects.” For lead singer Zoe Kravitz, said projects include modeling and appearing in films like “Divergent” and “After Earth.”
