It is an expensive disease to treat and monitor.\n\n\n\nDiabetics need to measure their blood sugar with a blood glucose monitoring device, or glucometer, to determine how much food to eat, or insulin to inject, to avoid complications of the disease. These devices and the blood glucose testing strips that go in them are not cheap. Typically, each strip costs about one dollar. If you test upwards of five times a day, that's about five dollars. For much of the world's population that is not an accessible cost, and for twenty-five percent of the population in Tanzania that can be fifty times your monthly salary.\n\n\n\nBioengineering students from Clemson University in South Carolina have built a simple glucose testing machine using parts from old inkjet printers. Named GlucoSense, this device works like any other glucose monitoring device. Patients prick their finger, put a drop of blood on the test strip and put the strip into the device. The glucometer is made from printer parts, which are less expensive than fancy digital glucometers. The glucose testing strips are made from a special mixture combining enzymes and dye created by the students and cost, right now, only five cents per strip.\n\n\n\nThese students turned their research project into, what could be, a global business. They have started a company, Accessible Diagnostics, to aid in distributing this product.\n\n\n\nChief technology officer and doctoral student Kayla Gainy is personally invested in this project, because she is a Type I diabetic. She says, \"I understand how crucial glucose readings are to treating the disease. I've been very fortunate to always have access to monitoring, but for people who haven't, I want to make sure that it's an option.\"\n\n\n\nGlucoSense already has four awards and the Clemson University Research Foundation is working with the company on intellectual property licenses.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"Description": "Bioengineering students at Clemson University have developed an inexpensive way to test blood glucose levels in diabetics.
