Marco Rubio pitched himself Sunday as the presidential candidate best suited to defeat Democratic front-runner Hillary Rodham Clinton and lead America far into the 21 century, even as he faces a crowded GOP field that includes fellow Floridian Jeb Bush and biting critiques over his push for comprehensive immigration reform.\n\nMr. Rubio also refused to take war off the table in thwarting Iran\u2019s nuclear ambitions.\n\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t do it, someone else will,\u201d he told CBS\u2019s \u201cFace the Nation,\u201d saying the Saudis and other Sunnis will not sit idly by as Shiite-led Iran builds an atomic bomb.\n\nThe son of Cuban immigrants, Mr. Rubio has positioned himself as a fresh face who can help others realize their American dream.\n\nHe has contrasted himself with Mrs. Clinton, who he considers a relic of old Washington, and President Obama, whose ideas were supposed to usher in change but, in Mr. Rubio\u2019s eyes, weren\u2019t good enough to make that happen.\n\n\u201cI think the 21st century is going to be better than the 20th century,\u201d the Florida Republican said. \u201cBut there are some things we need to do to make that happen.\u201d\n\nMr. Rubio said Mrs. Clinton has refused to distinguish herself from Mr. Obama, and he blamed her for the failed diplomatic \u201creset\u201d with Russia and the response to the 2012 terrorist attacks on the U.S. diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya.\n\nMr. Rubio officially announced his candidacy last week, following fellow Republican Sens. Ted Cruz of Texas and Rand Paul of Kentucky.\n\nIn an awkward turn, he now faces Mr. Bush, the GOP establishment front-runner who served as a mentor to Mr. Rubio during his rise through Florida politics before winning a Senate seat in 2010.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a unique situation,\u201d Mr. Rubio told CBS, adding the competitive field will be good for the party in the long run.\n\nAs he courts conservatives, Mr. Rubio must face questions about his push for comprehensive immigration reform as part of a bipartisan \u201cgroup of eight\u201d in 2013. The bill passed the Senate but stalled in the House over concerns about border security and a potential path to citizenship for illegal immigrants.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t do it in a massive piece of legislation,\u201d Mr. Rubio said Sunday. \u201cAnd I know, because I tried.\u201d\n\nSen. Claire McCaskill, Missouri Democrat who offered full-on support Sunday for Mrs. Clinton\u2019s 2016 bid, told ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week\u201d that the episode is telling, in that Mr. Rubio \u201cfolded like a cheap shotgun\u201d once conservatives criticized his bill.\n\nLooking forward, Mr. Rubio said the country should strengthen its border and visa-tracking systems so it can put in place a system that subjects undocumented immigrants to background checks and payment of fines and back-taxes \u2014 part of a route to legal residency.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a long process, it\u2019s a reasonably process, it\u2019s a fair process,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it has to happen in that order.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Sen.
