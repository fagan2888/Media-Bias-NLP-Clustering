But, after pulling Swaminarayan to the surface, the bystander\u2019s attempts at CPR could not revive him. The Pitkin County Sheriff\u2019s Office said Swaminarayan had been underwater for 10 to 15 minutes.\n\n\u201cI was exhausted, but I gave him mouth-to-mouth,\u201d the bystander, Bo Weinglass, told The Aspen Times. \u201cAt that point, he wasn\u2019t responding.\u201d\n\nThe accident happened around 3:30 p.m. Friday at a spot known as the Devil\u2019s Punchbowl, off of Colorado 82 southeast of Aspen. The Punchbowl is formed by the Roaring Fork River pouring into a natural rock bowl, creating a bubbling caldron that attracts cliff divers.\n\nAccording to the sheriff\u2019s office, witnesses said Swaminarayan jumped into the Punchbowl to help his wife, after she fell in. Swaminarayan helped his wife to shore but was then sucked under by the river\u2019s current. One witness told the Times that there is no cell service in that part of Independence Pass, so she ran to the road to flag down motorists and tell them to drive down far enough to call 911.\n\nWeinglass was in one of the cars that stopped, and the witness said he immediately got out and began running toward the river, pulling his shirt off as he went.\n\n\u201cI was screaming, \u2018Where\u2019s the person? Where\u2019s the person?\u2019 but nobody really knew,\u201d Weinglass told the Times. \u201cFinally a kid pointed where he thought the body was. I jumped in with my eyes wide open, and I immediately saw the victim\u2019s legs sticking up. He was definitely stuck, and the water was really moving through there.\u201d\n\nThe sheriff\u2019s office said Swaminarayan, 38, was from Stafford, Texas, a suburb of Houston.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Texas man drowns in Devil\u2019s Punchbowl near Aspen while saving his wife", "title": "Texas man drowns in Devil\u2019s Punchbowl near Aspen while saving his wife", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/09/13/texas-man-drowns-in-devils-punchbowl-near-aspen-while-saving-his-wife/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "height": 630}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-09-13T17:22:18+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-09-13T17:22:18+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda62d\"", "article_summary": "According to the sheriff\u2019s office, witnesses said Swaminarayan jumped into the Punchbowl to help his wife, after she fell in.\n\u201cI was exhausted, but I gave him mouth-to-mouth,\u201d the bystander, Bo Weinglass, told The Aspen Times.\nHe was definitely stuck, and the water was really moving through there.\u201dThe sheriff\u2019s office said Swaminarayan, 38, was from Stafford, Texas, a suburb of Houston.\nThe Pitkin County Sheriff\u2019s Office said Swaminarayan had been underwater for 10 to 15 minutes.\n\u201cAt that point, he wasn\u2019t responding.\u201dThe accident happened around 3:30 p.m. Friday at a spot known as the Devil\u2019s Punchbowl, off of Colorado 82 southeast of Aspen."}
