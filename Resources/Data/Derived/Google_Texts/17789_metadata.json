In a press release on his campaign website, Trump said it was his \u201cgreat honor to receive endorsements\u201d from Gallups and a number of other \u201cprominent community leaders\u201d \u2014 among them George Scarborough, brother of MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe\u201d co-host Joe Scarborough.\n\nThe press release describes Gallups as \u201can author, radio and television talk show host and senior pastor of Hickory Hammock Baptist Church in Milton, FL.\u201d Milton is a small town in the Florida Panhandle with an estimated population of 9,445, according to most recent census data. His radio show \u201cFreedom Friday\u201d airs (you guessed it) every Friday on AM radio. He appears with some frequency on several shows I\u2019ve never heard of and the \u201cJim Bakker Show,\u201d which I\u2019ve heard of only in reference to the host\u2019s endorsement of survivalist food buckets:\n\nBut beyond a certain Evangelist niche, Gallups is a relative no-name. What makes this small-town conservative pastor interesting?\n\nWell, for starters, Gallups is the proprietor of PNN, a self-described \u201cNews & Media Network\u201d tirelessly devoted to \u201cinvestigating\u201d various conspiracy theories, especially if they concern Barack Obama\u2019s allegiance to Islam.\n\nIn a 2010 YouTube video titled \u201cSHOCK INTELL! Is Barack Obama Really A Saudi / Muslim \u2018Plant\u2019 in the White House?\u201d published on PNN\u2019s account, Gallups \u2014 narrating an ineptly DIY iMovie with text effects \u2014 points to video of Obama bowing to the now-deceased King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia as evidence of the president\u2019s Muslim origins. The PNN video only showed stills of Obama\u2019s \u201coffense,\u201d but frequent pseudonymous guest Barry Soetoro (the monicker conspiracy theorists falsely alleged Obama used as an \u201cinternational student\u201d at Columbia University) posted on his website (which now ironically redirects to whitehouse.gov) video proof set to Tool\u2019s \u201cThe Pot\u201d:", "article_metadata": {"description": "Carl Gallups is relatively unknown outside the Panhandle, but his endorsement should be cause for alarm at Trump HQ VIDEO", "title": "Trump\u2019s new wacko backer: This Sandy Hook truther and obscure Evangelical pastor might be the Donald\u2019s most batsh*t endorser yet", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Carl Gallups is relatively unknown outside the Panhandle, but his endorsement should be cause for alarm at Trump HQ VIDEO", "title": "Trump\u2019s new wacko backer: This Sandy Hook truther and obscure Evangelical pastor might be the Donald\u2019s most batsh*t endorser yet", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2016/03/08/trumps_new_wacko_backer_this_sandy_hook_truther_and_obscure_evangelical_pastor_might_be_the_donalds_most_batsht_endorser_yet/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/03/gallups_trump.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Carl Gallups is relatively unknown outside the Panhandle, but his endorsement should be cause for alarm at Trump HQ VIDEO", "title": "Trump\u2019s new wacko backer: This Sandy Hook truther and obscure Evangelical pastor might be the Donald\u2019s most batsh*t endorser yet", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/03/gallups_trump.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Brendan Gauthier", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Barack Obama, Carl Gallups, Donald Trump, Elections 2016, FL, Florida Panhandle, Michele Bachmann, Milton, Nativism, neo-fascism, Sandy Hook, white supremacism", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "His radio show \u201cFreedom Friday\u201d airs (you guessed it) every Friday on AM radio.\nWhat makes this small-town conservative pastor interesting?\nWell, for starters, Gallups is the proprietor of PNN, a self-described \u201cNews & Media Network\u201d tirelessly devoted to \u201cinvestigating\u201d various conspiracy theories, especially if they concern Barack Obama\u2019s allegiance to Islam.\nIn a 2010 YouTube video titled \u201cSHOCK INTELL!\nIn a press release on his campaign website, Trump said it was his \u201cgreat honor to receive endorsements\u201d from Gallups and a number of other \u201cprominent community leaders\u201d \u2014 among them George Scarborough, brother of MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe\u201d co-host Joe Scarborough."}
