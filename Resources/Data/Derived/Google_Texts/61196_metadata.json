While median household incomes have shrunk since the economic crisis, published tuition at public colleges has jumped 25 percent since 2008, largely in response to state funding cuts.\n\nNet prices \u2014 what students pay after grants and scholarships \u2014 have not risen as quickly thanks to a one-time, unprecedented increase in Pell Grant spending. But with income and tuition moving in opposite directions, students increasingly face a bleak choice: take on crippling debt or forgo college.\n\nSome say the solution is to create a \u201cpublic option\u201d for higher education \u2014 to reallocate existing federal student aid dollars toward a European-style system of free public colleges. American Federation of Teachers\u2019 University Council president Robert Samuels argues that we could pay for a public option by directing federal student aid investments to public campuses and requiring those schools to focus resources on instruction.\n\nWhile it\u2019s tempting to assume that tuition-free public colleges would solve our higher education problems overnight, merely moving resources around is no panacea for rising costs and low rates of student success.\n\nFirst, a public option would change who pays for higher education, but not necessarily how much it costs to provide it. Economists argue that traditional higher education is like other service industries: because the product entails interaction with highly educated labor in small groups, it is difficult to raise productivity.\n\nAs wages rise in the rest of the economy, colleges must pay employees more even though their output doesn\u2019t increase, leading to higher costs. Simply shifting who pays the bill will do little to change this equation. So while existing federal and state investments might cover the cost of a public option today, those same sums won\u2019t go as far next year or the year after unless colleges also make changes to their cost structure. Taxpayers would have to foot an increasingly large bill.\n\nSecond, it\u2019s not clear that a public option would automatically raise student success. Take California\u2019s community colleges, which have the lowest published tuition in the nation \u2014 $1,135 in 2011-12 \u2014 and are essentially free to many students who qualify for Pell Grants. A 2012 analysis by the Institute for a Competitive Workforce found that retention and completion rates across California\u2019s community colleges were above the national average.\n\nBut completion rates were even higher at two-year colleges in Wisconsin and North Dakota, where tuition is two to three times as high and Pell Grant recipients make up a larger percentage of enrollments.\n\nThe point isn\u2019t that tuition prices don\u2019t matter. But these outcomes do suggest that pushing tuition to zero may not be a silver-bullet solution to lackluster student success.\n\nFinally, a public option would crowd out innovations that emerge from private colleges. Western Governor\u2019s University in Salt Lake City, Southern New Hampshire, Excelsior College in Albany, N.Y. and Capella University in Minneapolis \u2014 all private \u2014 are perfecting competency-based models where students get credit based on what they know rather than how long they sit in class.\n\nSolving the college cost crisis will require fundamental changes in cost structures, not just tuition prices. To get there, leaders need to foster competition across all types of providers, not create a public monopoly.\n\nAndrew P.
