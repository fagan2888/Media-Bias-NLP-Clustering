The Senate took the first step to advance $1.1 billion in emergency funding to respond to the Zika virus by a vote of 68-29, approving cloture on the deal.

Republicans blocked cloture on a $1.9 billion amendment from Florida Sens. Bill Nelson (D) and Marco Rubio (R), which would have fulfilled the Obama administrationâ€™s request, although Sens. Kelly Ayotte (R-N.H.), Bill Cassidy (R-La.), Mark Kirk (R-Ill.), Rob Portman (R-Ohio) and Rubio joined Democrats in voting in favor of cloture.

A third option of $1.1 billion in funding, offset through an Affordable Care Act fund proposed by Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas), failed along party lines by a vote of 52-45.

The amendment, part of an unrelated spending bill, will still need to be agreed to, now that cloture has been invoked.
