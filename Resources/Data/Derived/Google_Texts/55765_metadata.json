If he's given the guidelines then he knows where the boundary is\".\n\nA NSW Department of Education and Communities representative told the commission Mr Krix should have stood down from any physical confrontation.\n\nThe representative said the Teaching Service Act meant that teachers had to respond to situations with the safety of students being the top priority.\n\nThe commission heard Mr Krix was in trouble for other incidents including one where the he caused three year seven boys to fall over when he blocked their path as they ran out of his classroom. The boys were from another class.\n\nThe 51-year-old had been \"told by his head teacher \u2026 that `teachers cannot block classroom doorways and they should not obstruct students trying to leave the class' even if there were a disciplinary issue involved\", the commission heard.\n\nAnother incident saw a year seven student receive \"serious burns\" and two others were set on fire in a science experiment led by Krix where students started kicking flammable liquid at each other.\n\nThe experiment involved Mr Krix lighting petrol in a \"science pneumatic trough\" in an outdoor area.\n\nBut the teacher left the students alone at scene of the experiment when he saw another student trying to \"take a can of fuel\" from the back of his ute.\n\nWhile he was away, other students \"were kicking at the pots of flaming liquid \u2026 until one boy kicked the pot over\" and the flaming liquid spilt on three boys, the commission heard.\n\n\"20-20 hindsight is a marvellous thing,\" Mr Krix said. \"If I was doing it today I wouldn't have the ute where it was \u2026 but I thought they'd have enough sense not to kick flammable liquid at each other.\"\n\nIRC commission Peter Newall said it was a \"gross failing\" of Mr Krix to turn his back on the students standing around \"flaming petrol\".\n\nOf the headlock incident, Mr Newall told the commission Mr Krix \"did not need to do so\".\n\n\"\u2026Mr Krix no doubt very understandably irritated by a student who refused to work, who distracted others and who swore when told to do some work, got in (the student's) face,\" he said.\n\n\"He could have withdrawn from physical engagement with the student and did not.\"\n\nMr Newall noted that \"teaching in the modern classroom\" can be a \"taxing and difficult job\".\n\n\"That teachers can expect to be sworn at and at times physically attacked must make the requirement to maintain calmness, patience and a disciplined learning environment extremely difficult.\"\n\nhe commission heard Mr Krix had a \"substantial body of achievement, largely in the independent school system\" but also in voluntary work including a \"training long term unemployed and ex-prisoners\".\n\nHe also taught in a program in Blacktown and Mount Druitt where kids who had been barred from schools could get the equivalent of their school certificate.\n\nA NSW Department of Education and Training spokesman said its policies and procedures state clearly that disciplinary action will not be taken against teachers who act reasonably in their conduct while disciplining students.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A TEACHER who was sacked for misconduct including putting a student in a headlock after the youth punched him said the NSW education system left
