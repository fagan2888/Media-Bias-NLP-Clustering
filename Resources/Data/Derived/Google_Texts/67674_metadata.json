As a crowded Amtrak train approached a bend in the track, it was barreling along at more than 100 miles an hour \u2014 twice the mandated speed for that section. The resulting derailment killed eight people, highlighting grave deficiencies in Amtrak\u2019s safety system.\n\nBut while Amtrak officials may have been devastated, they could not have been surprised: The accident confirmed clear vulnerabilities in the safety system, shortcomings that the rail company\u2019s internal watchdog had been warning about for more than two years.\n\nIn a December 2012 report, Amtrak\u2019s inspector general wrote that \u201cformidable\u201d and \u201csignificant challenges\u201d were delaying deployment of a safety system known as Positive Train Control, which identifies cars that are traveling at excessive speeds and automatically slows their progress. Four years earlier, Congress had required that Amtrak and other American rail companies add the technology to their operations, but only a fraction of the rail systems were by then covered. Had the PTC technology been in place in Philadelphia, federal regulators say, the derailment might well have been prevented.\n\nThe inspector general\u2019s 2012 report zeroed in on one missing element that was crucial to the broader deployment of the safety system: Amtrak had for years failed to acquire adequate rights to broadcast communications signals through the public airwaves. Without these so-called spectrum rights, Amtrak\u2019s trains could not communicate with the electronic brains of the safety system, preventing its use along key stretches of track. This lack of spectrum had become the \u201cmost serious challenge\u201d in the railroad\u2019s efforts to deploy the safety equipment more broadly, Amtrak\u2019s watchdog warned.\n\nThe failure to more quickly address this challenge seems like a story that the political world can oversimplify into a standard tale of cut-and-dry blame, featuring singular villains. But in this saga, many factors appear to have contributed to the disaster.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The tragedy of the derailment in Philadelphia is that it was entirely preventable.
