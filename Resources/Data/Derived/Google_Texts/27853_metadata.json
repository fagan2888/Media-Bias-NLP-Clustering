They will report financial results as part of Citi Holdings from the first quarter, the bank said.\n\nCiti Holdings is the division that holds all non-core assets that the bank is winding down or selling.\n\nBy shifting the Latin American businesses to the Citi Holdings run-off portfolio, Corbat will move closer to his target even before the units are sold or closed.\n\nAt the end of the fourth quarter, Citi Holdings had $74 billion in assets, 43 percent lower than a year earlier, and represented about 4 percent of total Citigroup assets.\n\n(Reporting by Nikhil Subba and Sweta Singh in Bengaluru, David Henry in New York and Tatiana Bautzer in Sao Paulo; Editing by Shounak Dasgupta and Don Sebastian)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Shares of the bank, which has operated in Argentina and Brazil for more than a century", "title": "Citigroup to exit retail banking in Brazil, Argentina", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/02/19/Citigroup-exit-retail-banking-Brazil-Argentina", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/citigroup-restructuring_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/02/19/Citigroup-exit-retail-banking-Brazil-Argentina", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/citigroup-restructuring_1.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "Shares of the bank, which has operated in Argentina and Brazil for more than a century", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Brazil accounted for about 9 percent of total consumer loans in Latin America at the end of 2015, while Mexico accounted for about 80 percent.\nThe businesses being sold are a part of its consumer banking operations and will be transferred to Citi Holdings.\nCitigroup has always struggled to compete with bigger Brazilian banks in the retail business, but things got worse in 2013 when the U.S. bank sold its profitable credit-card unit Credicard SA.\nAt the end of the fourth quarter, Citi Holdings had $74 billion in assets, 43 percent lower than a year earlier, and represented about 4 percent of total Citigroup assets.\nThey will report financial results as part of Citi Holdings from the first quarter, the bank said."}
