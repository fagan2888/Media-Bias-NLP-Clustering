That\u2019s uncalled for: Under sequestration, spending would have been cut in 2014, but in a far from devastating way, but it would rise again in 2015. It\u2019s especially less of a concern when you consider just how much the government spends and how much it\u2019s grown in the last decade. But this deal and the rhetoric about how brutal the sequester cuts are also a bad sign about the willingness of lawmakers to tackle the problem of entitlement spending. Sadly, it\u2019s hard to imagine that those who found sequester cuts \u201cdevastating\u201d will have the willpower required to reform Medicare, Social Security, and Obamacare.\n\nThat all is a problem because, absent changes to entitlement programs, the United States is on a totally unsustainable path. The U.S. government has racked up $12 trillion in public debt, nearly three-quarters of gross domestic product., yet that massive sum pales in comparison to the costs of the federal government\u2019s unpaid promises.\n\nAlthough these future commitments are not scored by the CBO, this off-the-books \u201cfiscal gap\u201d is real, and economists and lawmakers of all stripes are coming to recognize the need for some honest accounting of it. A recent paper by Boston University economist Laurence Kotlikoff for the Mercatus Center argues it adds up to $205 trillion over an infinite time horizon. That number varies fairly widely from year to year, based on changes to our fiscal policy. Kotlikoff had an even higher number last year, before the fiscal-cliff deal raised some taxes permanently.

Hamilton of the University of California, San Diego, finds a $70.1 trillion gap.
