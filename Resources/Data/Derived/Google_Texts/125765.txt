Under the Affordable Care Act, deductibles are increasing in 41 states, with some deductibles increasing by more than $1,000, according to Freedom Partners 2016 Obamacare deductible increase tracker.

The tracker looks at deductible increases from the previous year through Obamacare’s Bronze, Silver and Gold plans as well as a weighted average increase for all plans.

While some states are already facing high deductibles of $3,000 or more, the tracker finds that deductibles increased by $265 or 8.4 percent on average, with some state deductible increases rising as high as $1,395.

There were 41 states that saw their deductibles increase in 2016, and 17 of those saw double-digit percent increases. The states that saw the highest percent increases were Mississippi with 39 percent, Washington with 31 percent, South Carolina with 26 percent, Louisiana with 24 percent, Florida with 23 percent, Minnesota and Vermont with 22 percent, Arizona with 21 percent, and North Carolina with 20 percent.

“Higher Obamacare deductibles increase, by hundreds of dollars, what families must pay out of pocket to access their health insurance. Instead of reducing costs, Obamacare regulations and mandates continue to drive up these costs and make quality care less accessible for hardworking families,” said Nathan Nascimento, senior policy adviser at Freedom Partners.

Freedom Partners also released its Obamacare premium tracker earlier this year and found 49 states saw premiums rise in 2016.

“Premiums rose in all but one state—Mississippi—and in most states, health insurance premiums are rising by double digits,” the report found. “Seventeen states will face premium increases of 20 percent or more.”
