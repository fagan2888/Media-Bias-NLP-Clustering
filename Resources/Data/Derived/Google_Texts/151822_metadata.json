Still, drug costs remain unaffordable to many patients, particularly those with high-cost, chronic conditions, even when patients have insurance coverage. An article published recently in the New England Journal of Medicine suggests that the ACA has increased insurance coverage for an estimated 10 million previously uninsured individuals in 2014, some insurers are structuring drug formularies in a manner that discriminates against (and discourages enrollment of) patients suffering from particular high-cost conditions.\n\nRegardless of the cause, the need for and utilization of PAPs raises interesting questions related to privacy and security of protected health information (PHI). I had the opportunity to co-present a workshop session on HIPAA at CBI\u2019s 16th Annual Patient Assistance and Access Programs Conference in Baltimore, MD this week with Paula Stannard, Esq. of Alston & Bird. The conference was well-attended, and Paula and I were asked a number of questions during and after our workshop that showed interest in HIPAA compliance by PAP entities, as well as confusion regarding it.\n\nPaula and I crafted a scenario in which a PAP\u2019s data system is hacked, and the hacker gains access to individually identifiable health information stored on the system. Both Patient A and Patient B have insurance, but suffer from a condition requiring a medication not on their carriers\u2019 formularies. Patient A put his own information into the PAP system after learning about the PAP from TV ad. Patient B let his physician put her information into the PAP system, after the physician explained that the hospital at which the physician works has an arrangement with the PAP whereby the PAP will help with getting insurance coverage.\n\nWe asked the audience whether the hacker\u2019s access to Patient A\u2019s and Patient B\u2019s information in the PAP was a HIPAA breach. A follow up to this blog will discuss the factors relevant to deciding when HIPAA applies to PAPs (and individually identifiable information they maintain) and when it doesn\u2019t.\n\n\u201cHIPAA, HITECH & HIT Blog is part of the LexBlog Network (LXBN).
