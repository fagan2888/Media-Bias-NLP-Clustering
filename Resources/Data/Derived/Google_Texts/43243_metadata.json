If they don\u2019t, those businesses risk thousands of dollars in fines if their workers end up receiving subsidized coverage through government-run exchanges.\n\nWhile this mandate has been widely derided, Xiomara Pe\u00f1a, Southern California outreach manager for the California chapter of the Small Business Majority, said there was not a large number of businesses crying out in protest as 2016 arrived.\n\n\u201cMost businesses \u2014 96 percent \u2014 have less than 50 full-time equivalent employees, so they are not impacted,\u201d Pe\u00f1a said.\n\nThe provision has been on the books since Obamacare passed in 2010 and was supposed to take effect in 2014, but Congress delayed the requirement until this year. The law defines full-time employees as those who work at least 30 hours per week.\n\nFor several years, employers have worked to bring down their full-time-equivalent totals to below 50 or limit the number of full-time workers they would have to cover if their staffing surpassed the government threshold. In other words, the delayed financial pain produced by Obamacare might have been built into the affected companies\u2019 long-range planning.\n\nThat could be the case, or it could simply be that the requirement was never as onerous as business owners thought, said Larry Levitt in Menlo Park, senior vice president for special initiatives at the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation.\n\n\u201cI think it just hasn\u2019t been that difficult for the vast majority of employers to comply with the mandate,\u201d Levitt said.\n\nThat is especially true, he added, for businesses with the equivalent of 100 or more full-time employees. They had to comply with the mandate beginning in 2015, and this year must offer coverage to 95 percent of their employees, up from 70 percent last year.\n\n\u201cThe vast majority of employers in that category already offered health insurance to their workers. They may have had to increase offerings in some areas, but most did not have to start from scratch,\u201d Levitt said.\n\nPenalties have also increased for individuals in the new year.\n\nIn 2016, the fine for not being insured increases to at least $695 per adult and $347 per child or 2.5 percent of household income, whichever is greater. However, there are also new benefits available for those who buy exchange plans. A new cap on specialty drug costs for patients with chronic conditions, and available dental coverage for adults, top the new-in-2016 list.\n\nWhile plans for businesses and individuals started at the first of the year for millions, there is still time to sign up.\n\nThe open enrollment period for Covered California is Jan. 31, and anyone who signs up by Jan. 15 will have their policy start on Feb. 1.\n\nOpen enrollment for businesses is continuous. Companies that decide to offer coverage can buy on a small business exchange operated by Covered California or from other marketplaces, including California Choice, a popular private exchange that caters to businesses and offers plans from some carriers who do not sell through the state\u2019s marketplace.\n\nDetermining which plan to get and calculating whether a business is truly at risk of a penalty can be complicated. For example, companies end up getting penalized only if one of their employees applies for and receives subsidized coverage through the exchange.\n\nPe\u00f1a, the Small Business Majority representative, said employers are well advised to seek the help of a local health insurance broker rather than going it alone.\n\n\u201cBrokers are great because they\u2019ve been studying every wrinkle of this for years. We love brokers because they can save a lot of time and frustration,\u201d Pe\u00f1a said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Despite significant push back on the employer mandate, the controversial provision of the Affordable Care Act quietly took full effect on New Year\u2019s Day.
