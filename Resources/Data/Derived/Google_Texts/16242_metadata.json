However, some of this fee is reimbursed by the national health scheme or private supplemental insurance. I suppose the closest comparison to the United States would be Medicare and Medicare supplemental (Medigap) insurance.\n\nThe Socialist Party promised eliminating this co-pay would increase access to care. Remarkably, it is doctors who resisted:\n\n...... hundreds of doctors took to the streets and went on strike over recent months to protest against it. They fear they will have to handle more paperwork to get paid by the public and private health insurance funds, with some doctors\u2019 unions describing the reform as a \u201cSovietization\u201d of medicine.\n\nPerhaps these French doctors have a better understanding of health economics than their American colleagues. The American Medical Association, for example, supported the Affordable Care Act, which gave us a greatly expanded Medicaid program. Medicaid, a joint state-federal welfare program, offers coverage to low-income Americans. Those patients pay nothing directly. On the other hand, they have poor access to care because Medicaid fees are low.\n\nCo-payments and deductibles have increased in the United States, which some advocates complain make Americans \u201cunderinsured.\u201d On the contrary, American doctors should be relieved they don\u2019t have to depend on third-party bureaucracies for their entire incomes, like their French peers will soon have to do.\n\n* * *\n\nFor the pivotal alternative to Obamacare, please see Independent Institute\u2019s book, A Better Choice: Healthcare Solutions for America, by John C.
