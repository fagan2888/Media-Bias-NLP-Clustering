The ringing cash registers and the happy cries of children are but ghostly echoes across silent streets as hearths beckon in the fading light, gathering friends and families.\n\nBut in the clutter of Christmas morn, the Christ born in a manger 2,000 years ago lives, liberating the hearts of sinners and transforming the lives of the wicked. The redeeming power of the Christmas message is nowhere more vividly illustrated than in the incredible life of an English slaver named John Newton.\n\nJohn Newton was born 300 years ago into a seafaring family in Liverpool. His mother was a godly woman whose faith gave her life meaning. She died when John was 7, and he recalled as the sweetest remembrance of childhood the soft and tender voice of his mother at prayer.\n\nHis father married again, and John left school at 11 to go to sea with him. He adopted the vulgar life of rough seamen, though the memory of his mother\u2019s faith remained. \u201cI saw the necessity of religion as a means of escaping hell,\u201d he recalled many years later, \u201cbut I loved sin.\u201d\n\nOn shore leave, he was seized by a press gang and abducted aboard HMS Harwich, and life grew coarser. He ran away, was captured, put in chains, stripped before the mast and flogged mercilessly. \u201cThe Lord had by all appearances given me up to judicial hardness. I was capable of anything. I had not the least fear of God, nor the least sensibility of conscience. I was firmly persuaded that after death I should merely cease to be.\u201d\n\nThe captain of the Harwich traded him to the captain of a slaving ship, bound for West Africa to take aboard human cargo. \u201cAt this period of my life,\u201d he later reflected, \u201cI was big with mischief and, like one afflicted with a pestilence, was capable of spreading a taint wherever I went.\u201d\n\nJohn\u2019s new captain liked him, however, and took him to his plantation on an island off the African coast, where he had taken as his wife a beautiful and cruel African princess. She grew jealous of John and was glad when it was time for them to sail.\n\nJohn, however, fell ill, and the captain left him in his wife\u2019s care. The ship was barely over the horizon when she threw him into a pig sty, with a board for a bed and a log for a pillow, blinded him, and left him in delirium to die. He did not die, but was kept in chains in a cage and fed swill from her table. Word spread through the district that a black woman was keeping a white slave, and many came to taunt him. They threw limes and stones at him, mocking his misery. He would have starved if slaves waiting passage to the Americas had not shared their meager scraps of food.\n\nFive years passed, and the captain returned, John told how he had been badly treated. The captain called him a liar and branded him a thief. When they sailed he treated John ever more harshly, and he was allowed to eat only the entrails of animals butchered for the crew.\n\n\u201cThe voyage quite broke my constitution,\u201d he would recall, \u201cand the effects would always remain with me as a needful memento of the service of wages and sin.\u201d Like Job, he was a magnet for adversity. His ship crashed onto the rocks, and he despaired that God\u2019s mercy remained after his life of hostile indifference to the Gospel. \u201cDuring the time I was engaged in the slave trade,\u201d he said, \u201cI never had the least scruple to its lawfulness.\u201d\n\nThe wanton sinner, the arrogant blasphemer, the mocker of the faith was at last driven to his knees: \u201cMy prayer was like the cry of ravens, which yet the Lord does not disdain to hear.\u201d Miraculously, he was rescued, and made his way back to England and fell under the preaching of John Wesley, and was born again into the new life in Christ.\n\nHe died on Christmas Eve 1807 at the age of 82, leaving a dazzling testimony to the miracle of Christmas. \u201cI commit my soul to my gracious God and Savior, who mercifully spared and preserved me, when I was an apostate, a blasphemer and an infidel, and delivered me from that state on the coast of Africa into which my obstinate wickedness had plunged me.\u201d\n\nHis testimony, set to music, would become the favorite hymn of Christendom:\n\nAmazing grace, how sweet the sound\n\nThat saved a wretch like me.\n\nI once was lost, but now am found,\n\nWas blind, but now I see.\n\n(Reprinted from an earlier Christmas)\n\n\u2022 Wesley Pruden is editor emeritus of The Washington Times.", "article_metadata": {"description": "In the clutter of Christmas morn, the Christ born in a manger 2,000 years ago lives, liberating the hearts of sinners and transforming the lives of the wicked.
