Another day of drying out made a big difference for farmers as wheat harvest is in full swing across the state.

Wheat farmer Mike Rausch is helping his neighbor harvest because his fields are still too soggy.

"I mean you're going along and you just drop, it's awful wet in spots," said the Garden Plain farmer.

Rausch isn't the only one dealing with the delay. Wet fields have caused problems for combines in several areas where farmers are already cutting.

"It's sitting there waiting on me, but I just can't roll in spots and you hate to tear a field up too bad because it affects future yields," said Rausch. "When you tear the ground up with the ruts it just doesn't produce."

A string of hot days should take care of that problem for a majority of Kansas farmers.

"One day makes a big difference when you've got a 100 degree day like this and with the wind like this it really pulls the moisture out of the soil," he said.

Come Sunday, Rausch hopes to be harvesting his 600 acres from sun up to sun down through the week.

"I'm figuring by Monday there won't be many mud holes left."

It's still early, but Rausch believes this harvest will likely put last year's to shame.

"The rain saved us, it came at just the right time," said Rausch. This year the yields are surprising. It's going to be OK."

Rausch isn't the only one with hopes of an impressive yield. Wheat production across the state is expected to hit about 314 million bushels, up from 246 million last year.
