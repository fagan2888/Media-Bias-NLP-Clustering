The Wesleyan family is hoping to use faith and togetherness in this tough time.\n\nThere was no class Monday at Wesleyan Christian, but all day students and staff grieved with each other.\n\n9/20/2015 Related Story: Wesleyan Christian Cancels Class After Death Of Football Player\n\nThey said it has been a sad couple of days, but looking back at Ben Hamm\u2019s energy and fun personality helps a lot.\n\n\"He definitely brought light to all the conversations; and anyone he was with, you really just felt alive,\" said Ben\u2019s friend, Nathan Budan.\n\nA serious head injury, sustained in a football game, sent Ben to the hospital just over a week ago; he died early Saturday morning.\n\n9/19/2015 Related Story: Wesleyan Christian High School Player Dies After Head Injury\n\nBen\u2019s friend, Sydney Frederick said, \"We know goodbye is not the end.\"\n\nWhile fellow students grieve, they are comforted by memories of Ben\u2019s high-power personality.\n\n\u201cHe had the most energy. Like, in off-season, we would put on the Rocky Balboa song, you know, the \u2018da, da, da,\u2019 and me and him would just start going crazy, getting everyone fired up to work. He always danced to the Rocky Balboa song,\u201d Sam Phillips remembered.\n\nThe private Christian school is a small one - fewer than 20 students, including Ben, make up the 11th-grade class, and only a couple hundred people on campus altogether.\n\nSchool leaders, like lead pastor Joe Colaw, hope to bring people even closer through grief counseling.\n\n\"Let them own up to their emotions because there are real emotions struggling in this process, and we want them to be able to work through this in a healthy manner,\" he said.\n\nColaw said, for many of the kids, this is the first time they've experienced death; and now is not a time to run from the topic, but face it.\n\nHe said, \"So, we've even said to teachers, you know, one of the things you can do when you open the class is, \u2018Alright, how many of you remember something funny Ben has done?\u2019 and to laugh, cause that's cathartic for us.\"\n\nHis friends said, together, they'll laugh and lean on faith as they press on.\n\n\"I really do miss him. But one thing is really comforting, he had a really strong faith and so I know I will definitely see him again in Heaven,\u201d Phillips said.\n\nThe school superintendent said Ben's father was at the school to talk to Ben's teammates. He reassured them it's OK to make this moment a good one because that's what Ben would want.\n\nThe team's next game is Friday.\n\nBen's jersey number was 28, so they plan to paint the 28-yard line in Ben's honor.", "article_metadata": {"wn-build": "XSLT-7.1-17", "Description": "For Wesleyan Christian School students, Monday was a day to cry and a day to laugh.
