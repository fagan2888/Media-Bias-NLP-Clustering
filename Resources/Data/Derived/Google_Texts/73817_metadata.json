Kevin Brady Kevin BradyIRS doubted legality of ObamaCare payments, former official says Report: Pacific trade pact would boost growth, jobs and incomes Puerto Rico debt becomes constitutional fight on the right MORE (R-Texas), chairman of the Joint Economic Committee.\n\nBut economists say that beneath the headline numbers, there is little to suggest the country is at risk of seeing the kind of runaway inflation that helped drive former President Jimmy Carter out of office.\n\n\u201cInflation has picked up slightly over the past few months, but it still remains very low, still remains below the Fed\u2019s target,\u201d said Gus Faucher, senior economist at PNC Bank. \u201cI don\u2019t see any indication it\u2019s going to get above that target in the next year or two.\u201d\n\nIn June, the Labor Department reported its Consumer Price Index was up 0.4 percent in May, the largest one-month increase since February 2013. And in the past year, prices were up 2.1 percent \u2014 just a hair above the Fed\u2019s 2 percent target.\n\nCore inflation, which removes more volatile food and energy prices from the equation, was up 2 percent in the last year.\n\nHowever, the Fed\u2019s preferred way to measure inflation, the Commerce Department\u2019s Personal Consumption Index, was up 1.8 percent in the last year \u2014 an increase from previous numbers but below the central bank\u2019s target for the 25th straight month.\n\nThe quickening pace of the price increases comes at a time when employment data is raising hopes of a lasting recovery in the economy.\n\nThe Labor Department reported on Thursday that the government added 288,000 new jobs, the fifth straight month of gains exceeding 200,000 jobs. The jobless rate has fallen half a percentage point in the first six months of the year, to 6.1 percent, faster than most analysts had expected.\n\nPersistently high unemployment has long been a major concern for the Fed, while inflation has presented less of an issue; it has lingered below the Fed\u2019s ideal level since the financial crisis. Bank officials were more concerned with deflation during the recovery because price growth was so stagnant.\n\nFed Chairwoman Janet Yellen said at her most recent press conference that the Fed could act to raise rates sooner if the economy was growing faster than it predicted. But she downplayed the recent increase in inflation data as more of a fluke than a trend.\n\n\u201cThe data that we\u2019re seeing is noisy. I think it\u2019s important to remember that, broadly speaking, inflation is evolving in line with the committee\u2019s expectations,\u201d she said.\n\nEconomists say there is little risk of the Fed creating runaway inflation because the major drivers of spiking prices are not there. Specifically, experts say rapid inflation usually is driven by strong wage growth, because employers have to increase the prices of their goods and services to continue paying a competitive wage.\n\nWage growth has been relatively flat, and many believe the labor market would have to improve substantially before prices would start to rise.\n\n\u201cWhen inflation creeps in, it\u2019s usually due to the demand for goods and services being increased because employers are having to pay more wages,\u201d said Jay Morelock, an economist at FTN Financial. \u201cThat is just absolutely not in the data. ... We see that nowhere.\u201d\n\nCritics of Fed policy are still pushing for the central bank to act as quickly as possible to wind down its stimulus. The bank is gradually shrinking the size of its monthly bond purchases that make up \u201cquantitative easing,\u201d but has emphasized it might not raise rates for some time after those purchases wrap up.\n\nBrady and other GOP lawmakers say the Fed needs to act more aggressively to exit stimulus and hike rates.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m convinced the sooner the Fed refocuses on inflation, the stronger foundation we have for our economy,\u201d Brady said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have anything to fear from normalizing our interest rates.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "The assessment comes despite mounting evidence that the economy is rumbling to life.", "description": "The assessment comes despite mounting evidence that the economy is rumbling to life.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Peter Schroeder", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "The assessment comes despite mounting evidence that the economy is rumbling to life.", "title": "Economists say inflation fears overblown", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/finance/economy/211513-economists-say-fears-on-inflation-overblown", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/article_images/shopping_050114getty.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-02T05:39:37-05:00", "type": "article"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-02T05:39-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/finance/economy/211513-economists-say-fears-on-inflation-overblown", "dcterms.date": "2014-07-08T06:00-04:00", "dcterms.creator": "Peter Schroeder", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Economics, Inflation, Unemployment, Business, Labor,Kevin Brady,", "article": {"published_time": "2014-07-08T06:00:03-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-02T05:39:37-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/finance/economy/211513-economists-say-fears-on-inflation-overblown", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "The assessment comes despite mounting evidence that the economy is rumbling to life.", "card": "summary", "title": "Economists say inflation fears overblown"}, "dcterms.title": "Economists say inflation fears overblown"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf43d\"", "article_summary": "That combination could indicate the U.S. is nearing an era of higher inflation \u2014 an outcome critics of the Fed say is bound to arrive sooner or later.\nEconomists say there is little risk of the Fed creating runaway inflation because the major drivers of spiking prices are not there.\nBut she downplayed the recent increase in inflation data as more of a fluke than a trend.\nEconomists see little risk of a surge in inflation, despite mounting evidence that the American economy is rumbling to life.\nBrady and other GOP lawmakers say the Fed needs to act more aggressively to exit stimulus and hike rates."}
