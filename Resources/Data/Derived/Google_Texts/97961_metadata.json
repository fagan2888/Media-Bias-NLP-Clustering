It found \u201clife threatening\u201d issues that needed immediate medical care, according to a letter sent Sept. 22.\n\n\u201cA thorough review of (Florida Women\u2019s Reception Center's) healthcare delivery system \u2026 revealed several deficiencies related to delays in treatment and inmate care,\u201d wrote Jane Holmes-Cain, the executive director of the Correctional Medical Authority, in a letter to state officials. \u201cThese findings are considered to be very serious, and require emergency notification and the Department\u2019s immediate attention.\u201d\n\nInspectors found:\n\nA diabetic prisoner didn\u2019t get insulin for two to three months.\n\nAn inmate with a golf ball sized lump was denied an MRI in July, and still hasn\u2019t seen a surgeon.\n\nAn inmate with a history of cervical cancer had an abnormal screening in May, but no follow-up until August \u2013 despite having symptoms that the cancer had spread to her brain.\n\nMissing and incomplete records for the 1,000 inmates.\n\nFlorida Department of Corrections spokesman McKinley Lewis said all the major issues identified in the audit have been addressed. The state is working through a correction plan.\n\n\u201cI do know additional staff were brought in,\u201d Lewis said. \u201cThey came from central office here, and I believe Corizon did bring in some additional staff as well to handle some issues. But I can\u2019t speak specifically to what Corizon\u2019s actions were.\u201d\n\nCorizon is Florida\u2019s for-profit health care contractor for prisons. Company officials didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment in time for this story.\n\nState officials said they plan to re-bid Corizon\u2019s contract in December or January after multiple reports of issues with inmates.\n\nReporter Abe Aboraya is part of WMFE in Orlando.
