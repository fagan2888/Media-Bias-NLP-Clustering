Formally establishing the connection does not mean all pregnant women infected with Zika will give birth to an infant with microcephaly, the CDC stressed in an announcement, but the confirmation represents a vital milestone in preventive care for Zika.\n\n\"We've now confirmed what mounting evidence has suggested, affirming our early guidance to pregnant women and their partners to take steps to avoid Zika infection and to health care professionals who are talking to patients every day,\" CDC Director Thomas Frieden, M.D. said in the statement. \"We are working to do everything possible to protect the American public.\"\n\nResearchers in Brazil have also investigated a link between Zika and a second congenital brain issue, according to The Washington Post: acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM), which has been observed in two Zika patients. ADEM is often misdiagnosed as multiple sclerosis, and is defined by brief, acute attacks following a viral or bacterial infection. While it's rarely fatal, ADEM often leads to lifelong cognitive difficulties or vision problems.\n\n\"Most of what we've learned is not reassuring,\" CDC Principal Deputy Director Anne Schuchat told the Post. \"Everything we look at with this virus seems to be a bit scarier than we initially thought.\"\n\nThe virus could also hurt business in the U.S., regardless of how far it actually spreads, according to Computer World. In affected regions, businesses are already encountering staffing shortages and employee reluctance to travel.\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- here's the NEJM study\n\n- read the Post article\n\n- here's the CDC announcement\n\n- read the Computer World article\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nZika virus: White House diverts unused Ebola funds but warns it's not enough\n\nExperts: Zika could be 'scariest virus since HIV'\n\nZika outbreak: White House seeks $1.8B to respond to virus\n\nZika virus: U.S. hospitals brace for pandemic as feds roll out safety measures\n\nZika virus: Hospitals batten down the hatches as CDC works on vaccine\n\nPublic health agencies, hospitals prepare for potential Zika spread\n\nWHO declared Zika virus a global health emergency", "article_metadata": {"description": "The\u00a0Zika virus\u00a0is far more damaging and scarier than previously thought.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "The\u00a0Zika virus\u00a0is far more damaging and scarier than previously thought.", "title": "Zika fears escalate: Virus is scarier than previously thought, CDC says", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/zika-fears-escalate-virus-scarier-previous-thought-cdc-says/2016-04-14", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "Anne Schuchat,Care Delivery,Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC),microcephaly,Operations & Business Management,Patient Care & Outcomes,Thomas Frieden,Zika virus", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Care Delivery,Operations & Business Management,Patient Care & Outcomes"}, "article_summary": "The Zika virus is far more damaging and scarier than previously thought.\n\"Everything we look at with this virus seems to be a bit scarier than we initially thought.\"\nThe virus could also hurt business in the U.S., regardless of how far it actually spreads, according to Computer World.\n\"Most of what we've learned is not reassuring,\" CDC Principal Deputy Director Anne Schuchat told the Post.\nThis week the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) confirmed long-held suspicions that the virus causes microcephaly in infants as well as other major brain-related birth defects, a discovery officials called a \"turning point\" in a scientific understanding of the disease."}
