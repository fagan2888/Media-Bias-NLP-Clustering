Children with ADHD may have trouble paying attention and/or controlling impulsive behaviors.\n\nEffective treatments for ADHD include medication, mental health treatment, or a combination of the two. When children diagnosed with ADHD receive proper treatment, they have the best chance of thriving at home, doing well at school, and making and keeping friends, the researchers said.\n\nStates vary widely in terms of the percentage of their child population diagnosed and treated with medication for ADHD. The percentage of children with a history of an ADHD diagnosis ranges from 15 percent in Arkansas and Kentucky to 4 percent in Nevada, the study said.\n\nNearly 1-in-5 U.S. high school boys and 1-in-11 high school girls were reported by their parents as having been diagnosed with ADHD by a healthcare provider.", "article_metadata": {"description": "One-in-nine U.S. children ages 4-17 were diagnosed with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder in 2011-12, and 6 percent were on medication, officials say.", "og": {"site_name": "UPI", "description": "One-in-nine U.S. children ages 4-17 were diagnosed with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder in 2011-12, and 6 percent were on medication, officials say.", "title": "11 percent of U.S. children ages 4-17 diagnosed with ADHD", "url": "http://www.upi.com/Health_News/2013/11/24/11-percent-of-US-children-ages-4-17-diagnosed-with-ADHD/19871385276257/", "image": "http://cdnph.upi.com/sv/ph/og/i/19871385276257/2013/2/13852756342427/v2.1/11-percent-of-US-children-ages-4-17-diagnosed-with-ADHD.jpg", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 130795020312660}, "keywords": "Health", "google-site-verification": "vnkcuJA1Q89cLmy4OZpuQKOf5Jf6ny_RVh7BpxZ11a0", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Health"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdbf4f\"", "article_summary": "Nearly 1-in-5 U.S. high school boys and 1-in-11 high school girls were reported by their parents as having been diagnosed with ADHD by a healthcare provider.\nStates vary widely in terms of the percentage of their child population diagnosed and treated with medication for ADHD.\nWhen children diagnosed with ADHD receive proper treatment, they have the best chance of thriving at home, doing well at school, and making and keeping friends, the researchers said.\nHalf of children found to have ADHD were diagnosed by age 6, but children with more severe ADHD tend to be diagnosed earlier -- about half of them by the age of 4, the study said.\nEffective treatments for ADHD include medication, mental health treatment, or a combination of the two."}
