The companies are required to provide coverage under a long-delayed mandate in the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThere are two main reasons this tactic makes little sense.\n\n1. The Obamacare mandate for small businesses hasn't even gone into effect yet.\n\nThe rule, part of which won\u2019t go into effect until 2016, compels businesses employing between 50 and 99 full-time workers to offer affordable health plans. But with already-slim profit margins in the food service industry, restaurateurs say they simply want to push some of the cost onto diners.\n\nOriginally slated to come into force in January, the Obama administration gave employers extra time to budget health care into employee benefits. Small businesses must pay penalties if they don't start insuring by 2016. Companies employing 100 or more full-time workers must comply with the rule by next year.\n\n2. Obamacare surcharges don't go over well with customers.\n\nTwo years ago, Denny\u2019s franchisee John Metz, who owns about 30 restaurants in Florida, ignited the fury of both customers and his corporate partners when he added a surcharge to customers\u2019 receipts. Denny\u2019s CEO John Miller reprimanded Metz and publicly distanced the company from what was interpreted at the time as a political statement opposing Obamacare.\n\nThen, earlier this year, a sports bar in Florida made a similar move. Gator\u2019s Dockside, a chain with eight franchise-owned locations throughout the central part of the Sunshine State, outraged customers when they found the truncated term \u201cACA surchar\u201d added just beneath sales tax on their receipts.\n\n\u201cPlenty of places sell wings and burgers and don\u2019t try to make political statements,\u201d customer Larry Ross wrote on the company\u2019s Facebook page. \u201cI\u2019ll be taking my business to one of those restaurants from now on.\u201d\n\nAgain, the corporate parent distanced itself from the decisions of a rogue franchisee.\n\nLast year, city officials in San Francisco began investigating more than 90 restaurants that allegedly pocketed fees added on to cover health care costs.\n\nBoycott restos that put an Obamacare \"benefit surcharge\" on the bill. Can't they adjust food prices accordingly w/o making a stink abt it? \u2014 sexy kazatsky dancer (@jody_beth) August 29, 2014\n\nSurcharges for health insurance aren\u2019t the only additional fees restaurants have been criticized for charging. In August, a caf\u00e9 in suburban Minneapolis captured national headlines when it added a 35-cent \u201cminimum wage fee\u201d to bills a week after Minnesota raised its minimum wage by 75 cents to $8.\n\nFollowing a furious backlash, Oasis Caf\u00e9 owner Craig Beemer issued a statement saying that his \u201cfamily is conservative in our views,\u201d but that he didn\u2019t mean to make \u201csome grand political statement.\u201d Still, he maintained the fee.\n\nThe novelty of the health care legislation may be to blame for restaurant owners' insistence on publicly itemizing the new cost of doing business. It would be unusual for an eatery to tack on surcharges for the import tax on the Swiss cheese used in a sandwich or the costs of keeping the kitchen clean for the health department.\n\nSo far, backlash has been mild in Los Angeles, according to the LA Times. But vitriol has surfaced in some online reviews.\n\n\u201cOutrageous that AOC expects diners to subsidize their employees health benefits -- we already do that -- by paying the high prices for their food!\u201d one Yelp reviewer wrote of AOC, a wine and tapas bar profiled in the LA Times' story. \u201cThe audacity, I was completely offended.\u201d\n\nTables at AOC, seen in this shot from its website, may remain empty if customer outrage spreads.\n\n\n\nAlso on HuffPost: Health Care Reform Efforts Throughout History Health Care Reform Efforts Throughout History\n\n1 of 17 1912 Former President Theodore Roosevelt champions national health insurance as he unsuccessfully tries to ride his progressive Bull Moose Party back to the White House.
