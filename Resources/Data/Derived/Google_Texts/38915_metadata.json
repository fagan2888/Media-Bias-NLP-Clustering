When Jean Louise\u2019s long-time suitor proposes, there\u2019s the lingo of Genesis. \u201cI, like Israel of Old, have labored seven years in the vineyards of the University and the pastures of your father\u2019s office for you,\u201d says Henry (Hank) Clinton.\n\nUnlike Jacob (Israel), however, Hank doesn\u2019t get the wrong bride (Leah) or labor seven years more for his true love (Rachel). Jean Louise was counseled by her aunt, who thinks Hank came from poor white trash, to marry her own \u201ckind.\u201d In this book, \u201ckind\u201d isn\u2019t just about class or race.\n\nThe ritual of baptism comes to life in a childhood flashback, as Jean Louise recalls the re-enactment of a tent revival played out with her brother, Jem, and sidekick, \u201cDill. \u201d\n\nIn \u201cWatchman,\u201d Jem is an unseen memory, a man who died in his 20s. Here, young Jem delivers a sermon on the devil in Maycomb, Ala., setting for the novel. The kids have a fine time until Scout and Dill fall to battling between a Methodist \u201csprinkle\u201d and a Baptist \u201cimmersion\u201d in a murky pond. Who is truly living a Christian life, a moral life, is the question just under the surface.\n\nAnyone who has endured a fracas over music at worship will appreciate the Methodist church scene of outrage in the pews when the congregation\u2019s music director, fresh from summer music camp, tries to \u201cpep up\u201d the organ music and abandon familiar \u201cSouthern hymns.\u201d\n\nOnly later does the fear of losing the Southern way, rigid segregation, become clear as the crisis point of the novel, the reason that Atticus and Hank tolerate the Klu Klux Klan and participate in the white \u201cCitizens Council.\u201d\n\nAnother key \u201cMockingbird\u201d character missing here is Boo Radley. He was the hidden-away, childlike innocent neighbor, the harmless creature whose timely rescue of little Scout and her brother in \u201cMockingbird\u201d sets up that book\u2019s title. Rather than be made a public hero, shy Boo is allowed to return to his \u201cplace\u201d because putting him in the spotlight would be like killing a mockingbird, says Scout.\n\nIn \u201cWatchman,\u201d there\u2019s a cruel flip side to this seemingly so very Christian kindness. Atticus wants all people he sees as \u201cchildlike\u201d \u2013 this includes all black people \u2013 overseen by the paternal wisdom of white society.\n\nJean Louise, who believes herself colorblind, is shocked to the core, bereft over what she sees as a betrayal of the father she idolized. The book\u2019s final chapters are a dense legal, moral and psychological showdown as the young adult Jean Louise fights with her father over truth and equality.\n\nIn \u201cMockingbird,\u201d he\u2019s the voice of racial justice, battling for an innocent black man accused of rape \u2013 the central conflict of the novel and the film portrayal by Gregory Peck. In \u201cWatchman\u201d Atticus is still interested in justice but views black people as inferior and unfit to govern their own lives.\n\n\u201cHave you ever considered that you can\u2019t have a set of backward people living among people advanced in one kind of civilization and have a social Arcadia,\u201d he says.\n\nShe battles back, aligning herself with religious truth:\n\n\u201cYou are telling them that Jesus loves them, but not much. You are using frightful means to justify ends that you think are for the good of most people\u2026You just try to kill their souls instead of their bodies. You just try to tell \u2018em, \u2018\u2019Look, be good. Behave yourselves. If you are good and mind us, you can get a lot out of life, but if you don\u2019t mind us, we\u2019ll give you nothing and take away what we\u2019ve already given you.\u2019\u201d\n\nLee chose her title from Isaiah 21:6 : \u201cFor thus hath the Lord said unto me, Go, set a watchman, let him declare what he seeth.\u201d\n\nWho is the watchman?\n\nAtticus\u2019 brother, Uncle Jack, brings it home: \u201cEvery man\u2019s island, Jean Louise, every man\u2019s watchman, is his conscience.\u201d\n\nIf Atticus was the moral spine of \u201cMockingbird,\u201d in \u201cWatchman\u201d that spine is Jean Louise, stepping out of the murky pond of childhood to claim her own, Bible-steeped moral identity.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Beliefs, Opinion, Atticus Finch, Go Set a Watchman, Harper Lee, racism, Scout, To Kill a Mockingbird", "generator": "Easy Digital Downloads v2.5.16", "og": {"site_name": "Religion News Service", "description": "The moral spine of the novel is not Atticus Finch.
