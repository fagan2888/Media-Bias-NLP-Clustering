He\u2019d built his medical and research career on helping young AIDS patients. Then he learned that he, too, was HIV-positive. The news came after he\u2019d already survived kidney cancer and a breakup with his longtime partner.\n\nTry as he might, the doctor could not heal himself, at least not emotionally. Then he got a dog. It was a little Yorkshire terrier he named Fred. And everything changed.\n\nThe doctor, who\u2019s helped save many AIDS patients, knows it sounds crazy that the companionship and simple needs of a pet could help him cope with his disease and pull him out of depression.\n\nAnd Garofalo began to realize that he was far from the only person with HIV \u2014 or any number of other diseases \u2014 who had been helped by a dog. And in that human-canine bond, he saw new purpose and an opportunity to grow his charity\u2019s reach.\n\nHe began a project called \u201cWhen Dogs Heal,\u201d with the help of a dog photographer named Jesse Freidin and a Chicago-based writer named Zach Stafford. It tells the stories of HIV-positive people and their dogs in an exhibit launching in Chicago on Tuesday, which is World AIDS Day, and also in New York City two days later.\n\nGarafalo now heads the Center for Gender, Sexuality and HIV Prevention at Lurie Children\u2019s Hospital.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "HIV-positive doctor says his dog saved his life", "title": "HIV-positive doctor says his dog saved his life", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/11/29/hiv-positive-doctor-says-his-dog-saved-his-life/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151129__20151130_A10_ND30HIVDOGp1.jpg", "height": 436}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151129__20151130_A10_ND30HIVDOGp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-11-29T23:34:20+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-20T07:19:28+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Animals"}, "article_summary": "He\u2019d built his medical and research career on helping young AIDS patients.\nHe began a project called \u201cWhen Dogs Heal,\u201d with the help of a dog photographer named Jesse Freidin and a Chicago-based writer named Zach Stafford.\nThe doctor, who\u2019s helped save many AIDS patients, knows it sounds crazy that the companionship and simple needs of a pet could help him cope with his disease and pull him out of depression.\nTry as he might, the doctor could not heal himself, at least not emotionally.\nAnd Garofalo began to realize that he was far from the only person with HIV \u2014 or any number of other diseases \u2014 who had been helped by a dog."}
