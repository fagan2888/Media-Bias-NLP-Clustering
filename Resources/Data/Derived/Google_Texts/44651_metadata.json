The proposal puts an emphasis on Los Angeles police and fire departments. Kim Baldonado reports live from City Hall for the NBC4 News at Noon on Monday, April 14, 2014. (Published Monday, April 14, 2014)\n\nLos Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti released a budget proposal Monday morning that focused on job growth, making neighborhoods more livable and a reform of the police and fire departments.\n\nThe proposal balanced a $242 million deficit the city is facing for the 2014-2015 year, in part by asking city employees to contribute more to their healthcare plans and not adjusting pay for cost-of-living expenses.\n\nGarcetti also hopes to increase funding for the Los Angeles Police Department, which makes up nearly 44 percent of the general fund already. Most of the $28 million increase would go toward new technology for officers.\n\nFirefighters would also see an increase in funding under Garcetti's budget.\n\n\"I'm proposing an $11 million increase in funding for the Fire Department,\" Garcetti said. \"For the first time in five years we are hiring firefighters.\"\n\nThe announcement comes less than a month after Garcetti ordered a halt to what he described as a \"fatally flawed\" recruitment process.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti released a budget proposal Monday morning that focused on job growth, making neighborhoods more livable and a reform of the police and fire departments.", "title": "Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti Unveils Budget Proposal", "og": {"site_name": "NBC Southern California", "description": "Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti released a budget proposal Monday morning that focused on job growth, making neighborhoods more livable and a reform of the police and fire departments.", "title": "LA Mayor Eric Garcetti Unveils Budget Proposal", "url": "http://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/local/Los-Angeles-Mayor-Eric-Garcetti-to-Unveil-Budget-Proposal-255197041.html", "image": "http://media.nbclosangeles.com/images/1200*677/lagenerics+downtown+los+angeles+skyline+aerial.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti released a budget proposal Monday morning that focused on job growth, making neighborhoods more livable and a reform of the police and fire departments.", "title": "LA Mayor Eric Garcetti Unveils Budget Proposal", "url": "http://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/local/Los-Angeles-Mayor-Eric-Garcetti-to-Unveil-Budget-Proposal-255197041.html", "image": "http://media.nbclosangeles.com/images/1200*677/lagenerics+downtown+los+angeles+skyline+aerial.jpg?ak=bc", "creator": "@nbcla", "site": "@nbcla", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "taboola_lead": "video", "robots": "noodp,noydir", "tp": {"preferredRuntimes": "Flash,HTML5", "FlashBlacklist": "None|None", "preferredFormats": "mpeg4,m3u,webm,ogg,flv,F4M"}, "fb": {"app_id": 61690781361}, "keywords": "eric garcetti, budget proposal", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/NBCLA"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "eric garcetti, budget proposal"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fccd7b\"", "article_summary": "Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti presented his budget proposal for the city Monday.\n(Published Monday, April 14, 2014)Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti released a budget proposal Monday morning that focused on job growth, making neighborhoods more livable and a reform of the police and fire departments.\nGarcetti also hopes to increase funding for the Los Angeles Police Department, which makes up nearly 44 percent of the general fund already.\nThe proposal puts an emphasis on Los Angeles police and fire departments.\nMost of the $28 million increase would go toward new technology for officers."}
