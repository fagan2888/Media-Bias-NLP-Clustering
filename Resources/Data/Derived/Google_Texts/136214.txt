Highmark Health says it had operating losses of $565 million last year, largely because of massive losses incurred by health plans marketed under the Affordable Care Act.

The Pittsburgh-based company is the parent of health insurer Highmark Inc. and its seven-hospital Allegheny Health Network.

The hospital network lost $36 million last year, but nearly all of Highmark Health's losses stemmed from government marketplace plans, which lost $655 million last year. Highmark officials say it cost more than anticipated to cover those enrolled in the marketplace plans.

Highmark's overall loss was less because other sectors made money. Highmark Health lost just $178 million in 2014.

Despite the losses, Highmark officials say the company's financial condition is "strong," including $6.3 billion in cash or investments and $5.2 billion.
