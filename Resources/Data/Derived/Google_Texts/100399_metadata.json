If you couldn\u2019t finish \u2014 or even start \u2014 an application, you\u2019ll need to get a special dispensation from the Washington Health Benefit Exchange to move ahead.\n\nSo keep reading, and we\u2019ll tell you how to be granted the dispensation, aka \u201cspecial enrollment period.\u201d Your insurance \u2014 if you are approved, follow all the steps, select a plan and pay \u2014 should begin May 1.\n\nThose who qualify for Medicaid (now called Washington Apple Health) can sign up all year long, as can those who are American Indian/Alaska Native. Others may qualify for special enrollment periods because of life events such as marriage, having/adopting a baby, moving, or losing other health coverage.\n\nOK, here are the rules:\n\nIf you started an application by March 31, but couldn\u2019t finish it, the exchange will contact you with instructions on what to do next. Some people have already been approved for a special enrollment period and will be contacted within the next week, the exchange says.\n\nIf you couldn\u2019t even start your application (because, for instance, you couldn\u2019t get through on the phone lines to get some crucial questions answered), you\u2019ll have to fill out an online Request for Enrollment Form. You\u2019ll need to start an application to provide an application ID number to complete the form. You may want to contact the exchange\u2019s Customer Support Center (1-855-9023-4633), a navigator or broker for assistance.\n\nRichard Onizuka, the exchange\u2019s CEO, said the new online form will allow people who were unable to start their application by the deadline to \u201cexplain their situation.\u201d\n\nStaff will review the cases in the order they are received, and it may take two to three weeks to review requests and verify eligibility for the special enrollment period.\n\nLinks to frequently asked questions about the special enrollment period process are here and here.", "article_metadata": {"t_omni_path": "st|health|healthcarecheckup|article", "description": "It's 'follow the rules' time for folks who missed the deadline\u00a0to sign up for a private health plan through Washington's Healthplanfinder but who still want\u00a0insurance.
