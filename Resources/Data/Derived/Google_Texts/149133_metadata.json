The veteran predicted in an interview with The Hill in Washington last week that ground troops would ultimately be needed to combat growing terrorist threats.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to fight ISIS. I\u2019d rather fight ISIS in the deserts of Iraq than in the streets of America,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019re going to have to put some ground troops in. Delivering 350 troops is a joke. There\u2019s no capability in that. I would rather see our ground troops go in as blocking forces rather than maneuver elements,\u201d he continued, also calling for a no-fly zone over Syria and Iraq.\n\nZinke warned the terrorist group posed an immediate threat to America and predicted it \u201cwill try to attack our home front.\u201d\n\nThe GOP hopeful also warned that government overreach and regulatory red tape are stymieing the economy, saying \u201cthe biggest threat is ourselves. We\u2019ve created this labyrinth of bureaucracy.\u201d\n\n\u201cUnless we take action this ship\u2019s going to hit the rocks,\u201d he told The Hill.\n\nZinke is angling for Montana\u2019s sole House seat, vacated by Rep. Steve Daines (R), who is running for Senate. Operatives in both parties say he has the edge in his race against John Lewis (D), a former staffer for Sen. Max Baucus Max BaucusWyden unveils business tax proposal College endowments under scrutiny The chaotic fight for ObamaCare MORE (D-Mont.), partly because of the state\u2019s conservative lean and partly because Daines is coasting to election, especially after the withdrawal of appointed Sen. John Walsh (D) amid a plagiarism scandal that brought his integrity into question.\n\nThe former Navy commander served in Bosnia and Iraq as a commander at SEAL Team Six, and he spent much of an hour-long interview warning against a listless U.S. foreign policy and calling for more actions abroad.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to have to make sure we shut and control our southern border. If a 7-year-old child can come across our border, then I can tell you an armed group of terrorists can come across our border with truckloads of surface-to-air missiles,\u201d he said, adding there\u2019s a possibility that American ISIS sympathizers \u201care just as dedicated\u201d to the cause as those fighting abroad.\n\nHe also blasted President Obama for not doing more to secure the release of Sgt. Andrew Tahmooressi, a Marine who\u2019s been in a jail in Tijuana, Mexico, since he reportedly crossed the border by mistake in March.\n\n\u201cIf I was president I\u2019d probably go to Camp Pendleton and ask for volunteers with the Marines and lend them equipment. And by the time they got to the border I guarantee you that Marine would be standing tall at the border,\u201d he said.\n\nWhen asked to clarify his views on the situation, Zinke said he wasn\u2019t seriously advocating moving Marines toward the Mexican border, but \u201ccertainly we can put pressure on Mexico to know we\u2019re serious about our Marine.\u201d\n\nA third-generation Montanan, Zinke played football for the University of Oregon before joining the armed services. Since leaving, he has run a consulting firm specializing in oil exploration, managed a conservative super-PAC and served in Montana\u2019s state senate.\n\nZinke faced a crowded and bruising primary that\u2019s left his campaign coffers depleted. Lewis is already airing ads in the state and has a big cash advantage, which could tighten the battle before Election Day.\n\nLewis\u2019s campaign contrasted his worldview with Zinke\u2019s in a statement.\n\n\u201cUnlike Ryan Zinke, John does not believe the answer to all of the international challenges we face today is putting American lives directly on the line,\u201d Lewis spokeswoman Kathy Weber said. \u201cMontanans have told John that they believe we have a moral obligation to exhaust every economic, diplomatic and political resource possible before sending in ground troops \u2014 whether it\u2019s regarding Mexico, Iraq, Syria or Iran.\u201d\n\nZinke dismissed Lewis as \u201ca D.C. staffer whose entire life has been in D.C.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a tremendous difference between being a political staffer and leading,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile Zinke sounds like a hawk on most foreign policy, he says he had mixed feelings about the initial decision to invade Iraq.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to say mistake, but certainly I was not the strongest advocate and I was critical of the decision. \u2026 I have mixed feelings about Iraq,\u201d he said. \u201cRight now one can argue that the region is as unstable as it\u2019s ever been.\u201d\n\nBut mistakes under President George W. Bush have only been compounded under Obama, he said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in full retreat across the globe in every theater, and that\u2019s what\u2019s happened the last six years, we\u2019ve taken an iffy policy and made it a real bad one,\u201d he said.\n\nThis post was updated at 1:00 p.m.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Ryan Zinke (R) is making a charge for Congress from Montana.", "description": "Ryan Zinke (R) is making a charge for Congress from Montana.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "rdfs": {"label skos": {"prefLabel": "Ballot Box"}}, "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "Ryan Zinke (R) is making a charge for Congress from Montana.", "title": "Former SEAL runs as hawk in Montana", "url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/house-races/217210-former-seal-runs-as-hawk-for-montanas-house-seat", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/blogs/ryan_zinke_courtesy.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-02T05:09:48-05:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-02T05:09-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/house-races/217210-former-seal-runs-as-hawk-for-montanas-house-seat", "dcterms.date": "2014-09-10T05:41-04:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Cameron Joseph", "author": "Cameron Joseph", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": ",Max Baucus,", "article": {"published_time": "2014-09-10T05:41:03-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-02T05:09:48-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/house-races/217210-former-seal-runs-as-hawk-for-montanas-house-seat", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "Ryan Zinke (R) is making a charge for Congress from Montana.", "card": "summary", "title": "Former SEAL runs as hawk in Montana"}, "dcterms.title": "Former SEAL runs as hawk in Montana"}, "article_summary": "Former SEAL Team Six commander Ryan Zinke (R) is making a charge for Congress from Montana and intends to make his voice heard on foreign policy if elected.\nThe veteran predicted in an interview with The Hill in Washington last week that ground troops would ultimately be needed to combat growing terrorist threats.\nADVERTISEMENTAnd he is touting his military experience at a critical time for U.S. foreign policy.\nWhile Zinke sounds like a hawk on most foreign policy, he says he had mixed feelings about the initial decision to invade Iraq.\n\u201cI think we\u2019re going to have to put some ground troops in."}
