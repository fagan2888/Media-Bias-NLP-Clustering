Photo: iStock\n\nEarlier this year, I kept running into the same advertisement in the London Underground: a rotating series of posters featuring self-employed people\u2014a chef, a builder, a landscaper\u2014sitting in a mid-air cross-legged lotus, a blissed-out expression on their faces. The ads were for Her Majesty\u2019s Revenue and Customs department, the U.K.\u2019s tax collector. In other words, these people had reached \u201cinner peace\u201d by meeting the Jan. 31 deadline for filing what the U.K. calls a self-assessment tax return for the self-employed.\n\nEach time I walked past it, I silently thought to myself: \u201cIf only it were that easy.\u201d\n\nEveryone hates tax season, of course, but self-employed expats from the U.S. deserve a medal when tax season comes to its blessed close. The reason? America is the only advanced economy in the world that enforces extraterritorial tax law. In other words, the U.S. taxes nonresident citizens the same way it taxes those living within U.S. borders.\n\nAfter five years of being a low-earning, peripatetic, twentysomething dual citizen (thanks to British parents who raised me in the U.S.) and freelancer who was confused about my tax status, I resolved in 2015 to switch from my American accountant to professionals who specialize in expat tax. Most accountants I found expressed sympathy that someone of my earning potential (or lack thereof) had to jump through such wildly complicated administrative hoops to comply with the tax codes of two nations. However, somewhat predictably, they did not advise that I attempt to do so myself.\n\nA single accountant who was certified to file in both countries proved impossible to find. Instead, I hired two London-based accountants, one who specialized in the U.S. and the other in the U.K. tax codes. Both of them met my sole hiring requirement: speaking to me in words I could understand.\n\nThe first course of action in the U.K. was to align my tax year\u2014which normally runs from April to April, with returns not due until the following January\u2014to the U.S.\u2019s more straightforward calendar-year system. This means calculating my U.K. tax liability long before it\u2019s due to have my accounting done before the April 15 deadline in the U.S. This also lets me track my earnings from various employers in one dual-currency, 12-month spreadsheet.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re a dual citizen like me, or simply living in a country on a work-sponsored visa, U.S. expats generally have to pay taxes to the country in which they\u2019re living and using public services, as well as report to the IRS what they\u2019ve paid. So, once I\u2019d declared my worldwide income in the U.K., it was time for my U.S. accountant to step in. She explained that expats have two main choices to avoiding paying tax twice\u2014a foreign tax credit or foreign earned income exclusion. Each has different benefits, and the second is harder to qualify for than the first, as you have to prove that you\u2019ve been in your adopted country 330 days out of the last tax year (vacations or work travel to other nations are not included) or that you are a \u201cbona fide\u201d resident who has set down roots.\n\nIn my case, the second was the better option for me, since my income is all considered \u201cearned\u201d (I have no property or investments), my earnings fall far below the 2015 foreign earned income exclusion threshold of $100,800, and my residency status is indeed bona fide.\n\nShe then determined that I could opt out of state taxes despite holding a bank account in my home state. She also filed an exemption for the Affordable Care Act tax, which U.S. citizens who are nonresidents don\u2019t have to register for since they don\u2019t require healthcare coverage in the U.S. Finally, she told me that I only needed to file a Report of Foreign Bank and Financial Accounts (FBAR), a lesser-known requirement of U.S. expats, if I had more than $10,000 in my U.K. bank account at any time over the past year. Unfortunately\u2014but also fortunately\u2014I hadn\u2019t.\n\nWhen I reach the light at the end of this 2015 tax tunnel, a process I started last October, I will have spent more money paying these accountants than the amount I actually owe in taxes to either nation. And yet by expat standards, my situation is relatively simple: I don\u2019t earn a lot of money, have no portfolio or passive income, and the U.K. and U.S. have a totalization agreement, which means that both income and Social Security taxes are protected from double taxation. In nations without that agreement, often only income tax can be exempted from double taxation.\n\nHowever, for so many other American citizens living abroad, it\u2019s not so simple. London Mayor Boris Johnson\u2014who was born on U.S. soil\u2014famously declared last year that he would start the onerous process of renouncing his U.S. citizenship after he had to pay capital gains tax to the IRS on the sale of his London home, despite not living in the U.S. since he was 5 years old. And since the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (Fatca) law came into effect in 2010\u2014requiring foreign banks and governments to report to the IRS certain banking transactions done by their American customers\u2014more Americans than ever before are renouncing their citizenship as they find that foreign banks are reluctant to take them on as customers.\n\nEven though tax treaties mean that most American expats don\u2019t pay income tax to a country they don\u2019t live in (unless, of course, they live in a income-tax-free nation such as United Arab Emirates or Qatar), the process of proving to Uncle Sam that they are off the hook almost always requires expensive professional help, as the penalties for noncompliance are punitive. For instance failing to file Fatca and FBAR documentation can lead to fines of up to $10,000, a portion of your earnings, and even jail time.\n\nI\u2019m more than happy to pay taxes for the public services I use. I value the immense privilege of possessing a passport to two of the most powerful nations on earth. However, in 2015, that privilege cost me \u00a31,420 in accountant fees, hours of research, and a lot of quality time with a spreadsheet. While expats of many other nations can simply say: \u201cHey, FYI I don\u2019t live here anymore\u201d to their home country, Americans are essentially on the hook forever.\n\nAs the April 15 deadline approaches, my American accountant informed me that one perk of filing taxes as an expat is the automatic extension to mid-June. \u201cGet it done ASAP,\u201d I said to her. \u201cI\u2019d like to have at least six months out of every year where I don\u2019t have to think about my taxes.\u201d\n\nRosie J.
