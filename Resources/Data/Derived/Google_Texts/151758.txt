With the return of "Crossfire" to CNN, we are taking a closer look into the hosts' lives with a series of Web videos.

In this video, Van Jones, a former special adviser to President Obama for green jobs, shares what comes first in his busy life: his children.

“Like probably most dads, my main thing, 80% of my brain is taken up thinking about my kids,” Jones says. “We can argue back and forth about politics but at the end of the day I’m worrying about my boys and how they’re doing and how they’re getting along in the world.”

Jones’ kids, ages 5 and 9, are on both sides of the talent spectrum. “I’ve got an older boy that’s an incredible athlete; the kid can play any sport imaginable,” Jones continues, “and I’ve got another son who is very introverted, he seems to be more like an artist like me.”

Jones, who commutes from Los Angeles to host Crossfire in Washington, says he prefers seeing his kids rather than the D.C. politics scene. “I think a lot of people are either real political animals. They’re here in Washington, D.C. they’re going to every event they can, they’re networking… when I’m here I’m reading books. I’m Skyping with my kids.”

Jones’ time is split; yet, he persists for his perspective to be heard. “I want to be heard on some of these topical issues but my roots are back in the grassroots heartland of America, not in Washington, D.C.”

“Crossfire" airs on CNN weekdays at 6:30pm ET.
