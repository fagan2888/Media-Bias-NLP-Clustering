Hundreds of green-clad revelers flocked to downtown Boulder Sunday for the 37th annual World's Shortest St. Patrick's Day Parade.

The parade kicked off as usual in front of Conor O'Neill's Irish Pub and Restaurant -- 1922 13th St. -- before going a few blocks down the street.

St. Patrick's Day this year is on Tuesday.
