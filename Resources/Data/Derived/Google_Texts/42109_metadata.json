Researchers at the National Taxpayers Union Foundation have done all the math on tax code complexity to reveal that the U.S. economy loses $233.8 billion as Americans race to complete and file forms.\n\nHere\u2019s the rationale: The organization says all that activity amounts to 6.1 billion hours of lost productivity - an estimated value of $202.1 billion. Added on: the $31.7 billion in out-of-pocket costs for professional preparers or software to comply with \u201ca complex and invasive tax code,\u201d the researchers say.\n\n\u201cAmericans face a rising tax complexity burden that essentially prevents anyone from being able to comply without assistance,\u201d says study author Michael Tasselmyer. \u201cThis year\u2019s study gives an indication of future challenges, revealing the additional complications the Affordable Care Act will add to the Tax Code and filing.\u201d\n\nIndeed, the researchers also found a \u201cstaggering\u201d 3,322 pages of legal guidance for the Affordable Care Act at the IRS website. The content includes regulations, Treasury decisions, assorted notices, revenue procedures, and revenue rulings.\n\nThe study also notes that the estimated length of the Tax Code itself is about 4 million words - seven times the length of Leo Tolstoy\u2019s War and Peace - or well over twice the length of the five Song of Ice and Fire series books that inspired the popular TV show Game of Thrones.\n\nThe study grimly recalls that the Form 1040 instructions were once just two pages long. \u201cToday, taxpayers must wade through 209 pages of instructions, quadruple the number in 1985, the year before taxes were simplified,\u201d it states.\n\nFind the research here", "article_metadata": {"description": "Researchers at the National Taxpayers Union Foundation have done all the math on tax code complexity to reveal that the U.S. economy loses $233.8 billion as Americans race to complete and file forms.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Researchers at the National Taxpayers Union Foundation have done all the math on tax code complexity to reveal that the U.S. economy loses $233.8 billion as Americans race to complete and file forms.", "title": "U.S. economy out $233.8 billion due to \u2018lost productivity\u2019 as Americans wrestle with taxes: study", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/apr/8/us-economy-loses-2338-billion-lost-productivity-am/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/04/08/bookkeeping-615384-1280.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/04/08/bookkeeping-615384-1280.jpg", "description": "Researchers at the National Taxpayers Union Foundation have done all the math on tax code complexity to reveal that the U.S. economy loses $233.8 billion as Americans race to complete and file forms.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "U.S. economy out $233.8 billion due to \u2018lost productivity\u2019"}, "Author": "Jennifer Harper", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb294\"", "article_summary": "Here\u2019s the rationale: The organization says all that activity amounts to 6.1 billion hours of lost productivity - an estimated value of $202.1 billion.\nResearchers at the National Taxpayers Union Foundation have done all the math on tax code complexity to reveal that the U.S. economy loses $233.8 billion as Americans race to complete and file forms.\nAdded on: the $31.7 billion in out-of-pocket costs for professional preparers or software to comply with \u201ca complex and invasive tax code,\u201d the researchers say.\n\u201cToday, taxpayers must wade through 209 pages of instructions, quadruple the number in 1985, the year before taxes were simplified,\u201d it states.\n\u201cAmericans face a rising tax complexity burden that essentially prevents anyone from being able to comply without assistance,\u201d says study author Michael Tasselmyer."}
