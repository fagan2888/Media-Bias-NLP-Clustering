Mark Pryor Mark PryorEx-Sen. Kay Hagan joins lobby firm Top Democrats are no advocates for DC statehood Ex-Sen. Landrieu joins law and lobby firm MORE (D-Ark.) will be joining the K Street ranks at law and lobby firm Venable, a partner at the firm confirmed to The Hill on Friday.\n\nPryor lost his Senate seat in last year\u2019s elections after a bitter battle with Republican Rep. Tom Cotton Tom CottonDems to GOP: Cancel Memorial Day break GOP senator: Reid's 'ramblings' are 'bitter, vulgar, incoherent' Reid: We're not breaking the budget deal MORE. Immediately after, headhunters began sizing him up for potential private-sector positions.\n\nHe will serve as a partner at the firm and may begin as soon as next week. As a former Senator, Pryor is prohibited from lobbying his former colleagues for at least two years. He can, however, give clients strategic legal, policy and advocacy advice \u2013 or put his law degree to use.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a terrific hire for Venable. Senators are the American version of legislative royalty and it\u2019s always great to have one as part of your team,\u201d Ivan Adler, a principal at the McCormick Group, told The Hill on Friday.\n\n\u201cHe's got an excellent congressional pedigree and will add a lot value to the firm,\u201d the headhunter said.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe National Law Journal was first on Friday tothe Pryor hire, citing \u201cthree people with knowledge of the lobbying industry.\u201d\n\nThe ex-senator also looked into working for Greenberg Traurig, Hogan Lovells and Arent Fox, those sources told the publication.\n\nHe spent more than a decade in the Senate, and served on several influential committees including the Senate Appropriations Committee. Pryor also sat on commerce, homeland security and small business-focused panels.\n\nPryor also has a term as Arkansas attorney general under his belt during the administration of former Gov. Mike Huckabee.\n\nVenable earned nearly $8 million in lobbying fees during 2014, a decline from previous years. However, the firm also handles a large amount of regulatory work \u2013 which often does not factor into that lobbying total.\n\nThe firm has clients in several sectors, including Marriott, Experian, American Airlines, Amazon.com, Lockheed Martin and tobacco giant Altria Client Services. It also boasts a team of well-connected lobbyists and former lawmakers, including former Reps. Bart Stupak (D-Mich.) and Jim Gerlach Jim GerlachBig names free to lobby in 2016 Ex-Rep. Gerlach ditches K St. in return to campaign world Ex-Sen. Pryor heading to K Street MORE (R-Penn.).\n\nThe Hill reported in December that the executive job market could be tough for the large number of defeated lawmakers exiting Capitol Hill following the midterms, but Democrats with experience cutting deals with Republicans -- like Pryor \u2013 would be highly prized.\n\nVenable did not return a request from The Hill for an official comment by the time of this posting, and declined to comment for the National Law Journal. The partner who spoke with The Hill is not authorized to speak on the record about the hire, and asked for anonymity.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "The Democrat from Arkansas will be a partner at Venable.", "description": "The Democrat from Arkansas will be a partner at Venable.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Megan R.
