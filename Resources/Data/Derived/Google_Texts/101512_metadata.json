Clinton defends Obamacare\n\nHillary Clinton offered a defense of Obamacare \u2014 but struck a note of concern for small-business owners who\u2019ve complained about mandates required by the law \u2014 in a twin set of speeches in Florida on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cI think we are on the right track in many respects but I would be the first to say if things aren\u2019t working then we need people of good faith to come together and make evidence-based changes,\u201d Clinton said at the first event, the Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society conference in Orlando, Fla., according to CNN.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThe event was closed to the press, but people could buy tickets and attend.\n\n( PHOTOS: Hillary Clinton\u2019s 50 influentials)\n\nClinton highlighted the problems voiced by people owning a \u201csmall business of 50 or more\u201d as well as those \u201cmoving people from full-time work to part-time work to try to avoid contributing to their health care,\u201d CNN reported.\n\nThose are the very voters who Democrats are concerned about appealing to in the midterm elections and to whom the most targeted messaging on the Affordable Care Act is taking place.\n\n\u201cPart of the challenge is to clear away all the smoke and try to figure out what is working and what isn\u2019t,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cWhat do we need to do to try to fix this? Because it would be a great tragedy, in my opinion, to take away what has now been provided.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is going to be challenging and I don\u2019t think we should throw the baby out with the bath,\u201d she added, according to CNN, saying the debate has been rife with \u201cmisinformation.\u201d\n\nShe struck a far folksier tone on Wednesday evening in talking about health care to a group of students at the University of Miami, where she engaged in a question-and-answer session with former Clinton-era Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala. Hillary Clinton and Shalala, the university\u2019s president, worked together on health care reform in the early 1990s, a fact Shalala referenced by mentioning the \u201cbruises\u201d the two still have from that battle.\n\n( PHOTOS: Hillary Clinton\u2019s life, career)\n\nShe asked Clinton to explain to the students why they needed health care, and in a personal style reminiscent of her husband\u2019s, she described the vastly better system the \u201cso-called millennial generation\u201d is entering into.\n\n\u201cOn a very personal, self-interested basis, you should have health insurance to protect yourself and your families from unpredictable costs that none of us know will be striking whenever,\u201d she said. \u201cYou can\u2019t sit here today and tell me for sure you won\u2019t have a car accident, you won\u2019t have a slip or a fall, you won\u2019t have some kind of disease that you never thought you\u2019d ever be stricken by.\u201d\n\nShe added that the \u201cvast majority of young people will get through their 20s\u201d without such a fate. But \u201ca significant minority percentage of you will not. You don\u2019t know what category you\u2019re in.\u201d\n\nClinton said the costs to everyone goes down with an expanded pool of insured people, and she reflected on her own life lessons.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to take a job, as so many people in my generation did, just to have health insurance,\u201d said Clinton, who has never been able to connect with crowds the way her husband does, but who talked in personal details to try to capture the students\u2019 attention. \u201cI know so many friends from literally high school, college, who stayed in jobs for decades because they had a spouse with a preexisting condition and they couldn\u2019t afford to lose the job they had. You will be liberated from that.\u201d\n\n( Also on POLITICO: Full health care policy coverage)\n\n\u201cMany of you are now covered because under it, up to the age of 26, your parents get to keep you on their policies. That wasn\u2019t the case a few years ago,\u201d Clinton added to applause.\n\nEarlier, Clinton gave a 20-minute speech that laid out potential themes of a future stump talk, focusing on inclusion and participation in society \u2014 regardless of race, religion or sexual orientation \u2014 as a means for improving the country. That\u2019s almost certain to be part of a message for a likely candidate who is many decades older than the younger voters who eluded her in her 2008 campaign.\n\nClinton did not attempt to connect to the students on false notes, and her repeated references to \u201cyour generation\u201d and \u201cyoung people\u201d underscored the age gap. But it also contrasted with the scripted, often stilted version of Clinton who appeared at events in 2008.\n\nShe invoked gay rights, acknowledging that Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer had moments earlier vetoed a controversial anti-gay bill in her state, \u201crecognizing that inclusive leadership is really what the 21st century is all about.\u201d\n\nClinton went on to talk about the early days of the United States, adding that \u201ca good number of us would not have been qualified as citizens. I certainly wouldn\u2019t have. Nor would President [Barack] Obama.\u201d\n\nShe recalled meeting Martin Luther King Jr. and working on civil rights, saying there needed to be equality \u201cno matter your religion, your ethnicity, or whom you love.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo one can or should sit on the sidelines,\u201d she said, adding later, \u201cYou are living and breathing the ethic of participation. I hope that your generation will be a true participation generation. I hope that you will find ways to make sure that the barriers that divide us too often are \u2026 torn down.\u201d\n\nShe called for an end to partisan rancor, a theme she\u2019s struck frequently since she left the State Department early last year.\n\nOn other topics, Clinton:\n\n\u2022 Expressed disappointment at the situation in Venezuela.\n\n\u201cWe were very involved in supporting a free press in Venezuela,\u201d she said, adding, \u201cThe protests that are going on \u2026 are demanding \u2026 a more inclusive government, a government that makes policy based on evidence not ideology.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe United States certainly is concerned with and invested in better relationships\u201d in the Americas, she said. But \u201cVenezuela is a difficult situation because it\u2019s a country that\u2019s not being well-governed. \u2026 It\u2019s a situation we\u2019ve given a lot of thought to but are not yet seeing changes being made at the top that will help Venezuela get back on the right track.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Said she was surprised, when she was first named secretary of State, by how interested people in other countries were \u201cabout my relationship with President Obama.\u201d\n\nWhen she appeared on an Indonesian version of MTV, she said, she was told by the interviewer, \u201cWe watched the campaign, it was so hard.\u201d\n\n\u201cI said yeah, yeah, tell me about it, I lived it,\u201d she said, adding that she served because she loves her country.\n\n\u2022 Remains concerned about the situation in Syria.\n\n\u201cThe agreement that the Assad regime entered into to disable and remove the chemical weapons stocks was a positive step, but it has not been fulfilled,\u201d she said. \u201cThere has not been the level of cooperation \u2026 of the chemical procurers and weapon stocks that we had expected at this time.\u201d\n\nShe added, \u201cThe fact is indisputable we have not done yet what Assad promised would be done, and so we have to stay focused on getting the chemical weapons stocks out of Syria.\u201d\n\nBut \u201cthe broader question about Syria is one of the most difficult to answer because it is a multisided conflict,\u201d she said. Things were done differently in Libya in part because it \u201chad a very weak air defense system. \u2026 Syria has one of the most extensive air defense systems, and elements of it are embedded in populated areas, so trying to do that would be extremely difficult and likely to cause civilian casualties.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Declined to elaborate on the \u201cTBD\u201d in her Twitter biography.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d really like to, but I have no characters left,\u201d she said. \u201cI will certainly ponder that.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "But she also highlights problems voiced by people owning a \u201csmall business of 50 or more.\u201d", "title": "Clinton defends Obamacare", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2014/02/hillary-clinton-obamacare-affordable-care-act-104027.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2014/02/27/140227_hillary_clinton_gty_328.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Obamacare,Health Care,Hillary Clinton,Affordable Care Act,Health Insurance", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "But she also highlights problems voiced by people owning a \u201csmall business of 50 or more.\u201d", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd196d\"", "article_summary": "Clinton defends ObamacareHillary Clinton offered a defense of Obamacare \u2014 but struck a note of concern for small-business owners who\u2019ve complained about mandates required by the law \u2014 in a twin set of speeches in Florida on Wednesday.\nThat wasn\u2019t the case a few years ago,\u201d Clinton added to applause.\nHillary Clinton and Shalala, the university\u2019s president, worked together on health care reform in the early 1990s, a fact Shalala referenced by mentioning the \u201cbruises\u201d the two still have from that battle.\n\u201cPart of the challenge is to clear away all the smoke and try to figure out what is working and what isn\u2019t,\u201d Clinton said.\n'I don\u2019t think we should throw the baby out with the bath,' Clinton says."}
