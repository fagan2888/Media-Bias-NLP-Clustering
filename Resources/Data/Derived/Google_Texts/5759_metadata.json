Michigan's unemployment rate dropped to 5.1% in August, its lowest point since 2001. Auto sales remain strong, and construction of residential housing is up this year thanks to strong multi-family construction in Detroit's downtown apartment market.\n\nPNC's Michigan outlook mirrors an optimism expressed by business owners nationally. The positive outlook is helped by a decline in energy prices.\n\n\u201cSmall businesses are like the economy\u2019s grass roots based on the employment and economic activity they create,\u201d said PNC\u2019s Chief Economist Stuart Hoffman. \u201cThese encouraging results demonstrate the job market will continue to grow for at least six more months and also strongly support PNC\u2019s forecast for real GDP growth of 2.5% \u2014 comparing fourth quarter this year to 2014.\u201d\n\nOther key findings of PNC's national survey were:\n\n* Almost half believe their company\u2019s cost for employee health care will rise in the next six months. More than half (53%) said they believe the Affordable Care Act will have a negative impact on business costs in 2015, up from 49%.\n\n* 58% expect housing prices to rise in their local market in the next six to 12 months, on a par with 59% six months ago and 52% one year ago.\n\nPNC Financial Services Group is one of the largest diversified financial services institutions in the U.S. It has conducted its surveys of business owners since 2003.\n\nContact John Gallagher: 313-222-5173 or gallagher@freepress.com.
