About 2,000 comic book fans made a superheroic effort to land tickets to New York Comic Con Thursday, lining up outside Midtown Comics in downtown Manhattan for hours before the store opened at 7 a.m.

Tickets to Comic Con are already sold out online, and the store offered a last chance to buy multi-day passes for the convention, which takes place Oct. 9 to 12 at the Javits Center in midtown Manhattan. People could also buy tickets to “New York Super Week,” a festival taking place before and during Comic Con. (Tickets for that event are still available) Five thousand tickets were sold at the store, according to New York Comic Con organizers and producers, ReedPOP.

Photographer Andrew Lamberson was there to shoot some of the waiting fans.
