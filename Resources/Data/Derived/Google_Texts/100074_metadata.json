But it's not true.\n\nIn fact, the year he took office, the city\u2019s graduation rates averaged 57 percent. That would be hard to double.\n\n\u201cWe just fumbled our numbers a little bit,\u201d said Kevin Coughlin, a spokesman for the Democrat\u2019s campaign. \u201cThe first email was an internal miscommunication of the campaign there. The numbers there got mixed up a little bit. So that kind of speaks to that. You know, we\u2019ll fix it and move on.\u201d\n\nBut moving on won\u2019t be easy. Democratic challenger Luke Bronin has already pounced on the mistake.\n\n\"We just fumbled our numbers a little bit.\"\n\nKevin Coughlin\n\n\u201cI just think it\u2019s important that we be accurate about the information that\u2019s used in this campaign,\u201d said Bronin, the former legal counsel to Governor Dannel Malloy. \u201cThe graduation rate has not doubled under Pedro Segarra and, in fact, I think that roughly a quarter to a third of kids still aren\u2019t graduating from school as they should.\u201d\n\nBronin said this kind of error plays into the narrative that Segarra is detached.\n\n\u201cHartford needs a leader who is getting under the hood, who is in the details and who is an active manager,\u201d Bronin said. \u201cAnd I think the failure to recognize a misstatement as significant as this one reflects the fact that this mayor views the job more as a ceremonial one and he\u2019s not involved in the day-to-day policy making or the day-to-day management.\u201d\n\n\"Hartford needs a leader who is getting under the hood, who is in the details, and who is an active manager.\"\n\nLuke Bronin\n\nBut Coughlin, Segarra\u2019s spokesman, said Bronin is missing the point.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, you\u2019ve got to acknowledge that graduation rates are going up,\u201d Coughlin said. Here\u2019s what he says the campaign should have written: the city\u2019s graduation rates have doubled since 2006, when the school reform effort began under former Mayor Eddie Perez. Segarra began serving on the council in 2006. Since Segarra took office as mayor in 2010, the average graduation rate has gone from 57 percent to 71 percent in 2013.\n\nIn those same fundraising emails, Segarra also took credit for building 1,000 new units of housing \u2013 something Bronin said was largely a product of state, not city, investment.\n\nSegarra also criticized Bronin\u2019s tenure in the city, saying that \u201cafter only two years of living in Hartford, he\u2019s still so new to our community that he has no idea how far we\u2019ve come.\u201d Bronin said Segarra is wrong, and he knows it. Bronin and his wife moved to the city in 2006. They then left for four years while he worked in the Obama administration. They returned in January 2013.\n\nBronin isn't the only one running. Other candidates include John Gale and Councilman Joel Cruz, and others are considering a run.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Politics", "description": "Hartford Mayor Pedro Segarra is boasting about his record in fundraising emails to potential donors, saying the city's \"graduation rates have more than", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://wnpr.org/post/hartfords-segarra-fumbles-numbers-and-challenger-pounces", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/wnpr/files/styles/medium/public/201502/IMG_7886.JPG", "type": "article", "description": "Hartford Mayor Pedro Segarra is boasting about his record in fundraising emails to potential donors, saying the city's \"graduation rates have more than", "title": "Hartford's Segarra Fumbles the Numbers, and a Challenger Pounces"}, "story_id": 389792722, "twitter": {"site": "@wnpr", "card": "summary", "creator": "@jeffcohenwnpr"}, "author": "Jeff Cohen", "org_id": 0, "dc": {"title": "Hartford&#039;s Segarra Fumbles the Numbers, and a Challenger Pounces"}, "nid": 36745, "datePublished": "2015-02-28", "keywords": "The Daily, Hartford Region, elections, mayors", "wordCount": 646, "has_audio": 1, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe00d9\"", "article_summary": "\u201cAt the end of the day, you\u2019ve got to acknowledge that graduation rates are going up,\u201d Coughlin said.\nSince Segarra took office as mayor in 2010, the average graduation rate has gone from 57 percent to 71 percent in 2013.\nIn fact, the year he took office, the city\u2019s graduation rates averaged 57 percent.\n\u201cWe just fumbled our numbers a little bit,\u201d said Kevin Coughlin, a spokesman for the Democrat\u2019s campaign.\nHartford Mayor Pedro Segarra is boasting about his record in fundraising emails to potential donors, saying the city's \"graduation rates have more than doubled since I took office.\""}
