Gov. Jim Cawley, who is unopposed on the ballot next Tuesday for nomination to a second term as running mate to Gov. Tom Corbett, took aim at the field of four Democratic candidates looking for their party\u2019s nod in the race for governor in November.\n\n[PHOTO: Republican candidates for the primary election gathered Tuesday at the Indiana County Republican Committee spring banquet at the Indiana Country Club.

Ed Rendell\u2019s administration.\n\nThe state\u2019s deficit of $4.2 billion has been erased, Cawley said, and Corbett\u2019s annual budget proposals have been balanced and approved before deadline the past three years. The budgets came in late the past eight years, he said.\n\n\u201cPeople said keep on spending at the same level, the economy will catch up and then we\u2019ll be fine,\u201d Cawley said. \u201cWe know now that $4.2 billion hole would be a lot deeper. Then there were those who said to ask Pennsylvanians to dig deeper into their pocket for more of their hard-earned tax dollars. The governor said that got us into trouble in the first place.\n\n\u201cWe chose to take the third road, the one less traveled but the one that is making all the difference. We challenged state government to do what all of you do in your personal and professional life: We would only spend what we took in. We weren\u2019t going to mortgage our children\u2019s and grandchildren\u2019s future anymore.\u201d\n\nCawley said unemployment is at the lowest rate since the beginning of the recession, the workforce is growing and state tax rates have remained the same.\n\nAt those rates of change, Cawley said, the Democratic challengers\u2019 proposals would halt progress.\n\n\u201cDo not buy their snake oil,\u201d Cawley said.\n\n\u201cInvite those who would consider any one of those four options (candidates Rob McCord, Katie McGinty, Allyson Schwartz and Tom Wolf) to ask themselves some questions. Who among those four is going to stand up to the leader of their party and say \u2018with all due respect, Mr. President, apologies are nice, but your Affordable Care Act is a disaster.\n\n\u201c\u2018It\u2019s putting Pennsylvania\u2019s health ... jobs \u2026 and economy in jeopardy, and the way you\u2019re rolling it out, it\u2019s putting the United States Constitution in jeopardy.\u2019\u201d\n\nCawley said the Democratic candidates would be unlikely to challenge the Obama administration policies on natural gas, coal and fossil fuels, which Cawley said are hurting Pennsylvania and jeopardizing national security.\n\n\u201cThe answer, sadly, is not one of them would demonstrate that courage.\u201d\n\nCawley\u2019s appearance at the GOP banquet capped a full day of business in Indiana County. Earlier, he presented the Governor\u2019s Awards for Excellence in Academics to representatives of Indiana Area Junior High School and Indiana\u2019s East Pike and Eisenhower elementary schools.\n\nCawley also appeared with other area dignitaries to announce state funding for work at Jimmy Stewart Airport and on area highway projects, and toured the Jimmy Stewart Museum in Indiana.\n\n[Alternate photo, click to view: Also in attendance at the dinner were, from left, Mike Baker, county commissioner; Jesse Daniel, committee chairman; Rod Ruddock, county commissioner; U.S. Rep.

He said health officials as high as U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius had refused to place her on the adult list \u201cbecause she was 10 years old, not 12.\u201d\n\nBarletta told of challenging Sebelius on the issue when she appeared at a congressional hearing on a different matter.\n\n\u201cI threw away the questions I was going to ask,\u201d Barletta said. Instead, he coaxed Sebelius to say she wouldn\u2019t deny someone a transplant based on their race or gender.\n\n\u201cThen I said why are you going to let a little girl die because she\u2019s 10 years old, not 12?\u201d Barletta said. \u201cYou could hear a pin drop in that hearing room. She paused and looked up and said, \u2018Congressman, this is a terrible, agonizing situation where someone will live and someone will die.\u2019\n\n\u201cThat answer went viral across the country.\u201d\n\nNot long after that, a federal judge in Philadelphia ruled that the government could not discriminate against the girl because of her age. She received a transplant and now is doing fine, Barletta said.\n\n\u201cNBC News two weeks ago said that conversation was one of Kathleen Sebelius\u2019 five worst moments as secretary, and I\u2019m very proud of that,\u201d Barletta said.\n\nBarletta, who is campaigning for a third term in Congress, called for increased government spending on transportation and infrastructure, but warned that at present rates of increase, the entire federal budget will be consumed by interest on the federal debt and by entitlement spending by 2030.\n\n\u201cThere won\u2019t be one dollar left for anything else \u2014 medical research, highways, law enforcement, border security,\u201d he said. \u201cI know it\u2019s a very uncomfortable situation, a topic for politicians to come home and talk about, but we have to do something about entitlement spending.\u201d\n\nCounty Republican Chairman Jesse Daniel recognized local candidates running for nominations in the election six days from now, but instead of allowing them time at the podium to ask for support, Daniel encouraged people at the banquet to personally meet and discuss issues with the candidates.\n\nU.S. Rep. Bill Shuster, of the 9th District, and his challengers, Art Halvorson and Travis Schooley, attended the banquet.\n\nDaniel also recognized state Rep. Dave Reed, who is unopposed in the primary, and Paul Corbin, Cris Dush and Harry Bodenhorn, the Republicans running to replace state Rep. Sam Smith, who has decided not to run for re-election in the 66th District this year.\n\nDaniel told the audience that he\u2019s not a fan of hotly contested primary election campaigns, and put out a call for peace after the votes are totaled Tuesday night.\n\n\u201cThere is more that unites us than divides us,\u201d Daniel said.\n\nThe event also served also as an informal farewell party for Smith, of Punxsutawney, the speaker of the state House of Representatives, who has chosen to leave the house after 14 terms in office.\n\nHe first was elected in 1986.\n\nSandi Gillette, the Republicans\u2019 banquet coordinator, said Smith is known among close friends for having excellent culinary skills, and presented an apron embroidered with the phrase \u201cChef Smith, Speaker of the Kitchen,\u201d as a retirement gift.", "article_metadata": {"description": "After a hiatus of several years, Indiana County\u2019s Republican faithful gathered Tuesday for a spring primary season banquet \u2014 a chance to hear from party leaders, hear a call for unity and generate some campaign funds, but not to listen to the traditional string of campaign speeches from candidat", "og": {"url": "https://www.indianagazette.com/news/indiana-news/gop-rallies-in-runup-to-primary,19865925/", "image": "https://cityportals-indianagazette-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/news/images_preview/19865925.jpg", "description": "After a hiatus of several years, Indiana County\u2019s Republican faithful gathered Tuesday for a spring primary season banquet \u2014 a chance to hear from party leaders, hear a call for unity and generate some campaign funds, but not to listen to the traditional string of campaign speeches from candidat", "title": "GOP rallies in runup to primary -  - May 14, 2014"}, "twitter": {"url": "https://www.indianagazette.com/news/indiana-news/gop-rallies-in-runup-to-primary,19865925/", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "https://cityportals-indianagazette-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/news/images_preview/19865925.jpg", "height": 409}, "description": "After a hiatus of several years, Indiana County\u2019s Republican faithful gathered Tuesday for a spring primary season banquet \u2014 a chance to hear from party leaders, hear a call for unity and generate", "card": "summary", "title": "GOP rallies in runup to primary"}, "resource-type": "document", "p": {"domain_verify": "3ca97edaeb86fb7bb30ac456fded8ee3"}, "fb": {"app_id": 129670787203115}, "distribution": "global"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe12fb\"", "article_summary": "[PHOTO: Republican candidates for the primary election gathered Tuesday at the Indiana County Republican Committee spring banquet at the Indiana Country Club.\n(Kayla Grube/Gazette photos)Republican candidates for the primary election gathered Tuesday at the Indiana County Republican Committee spring banquet at the Indiana Country Club.\nJim Cawley, guest speaker; state Sen.
