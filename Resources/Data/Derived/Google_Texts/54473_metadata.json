As I wrote last week, geo-baching is becoming more popular for 21st century military families, especially dual-income families or those with children in high school.\n\nThe decision to live apart, even if temporarily, is a difficult one to make, but it\u2019s not always the end of the world, either. For the past 2\u00bd years, Dustin lived as a geo bachelor in Washington, D.C., while we kept the family in Maine. Although the path was bumpy at times \u2014 remember that Maine-to-D.C. train trip when I learned my family might be people repellant? \u2014 we found many things to learn and appreciate as well.\n\nMy husband needs me \u2014 to clean his space\n\nFirst, a quiz: Where do you keep utensils?\n\nI\u2019m reading your mind now and seeing that you\u2019ve chosen \u201ca top drawer in the kitchen\u201d and \u201cthe top drawer nearest the dishwasher.\u201d\n\nIf you are like Dustin, however, these are both wrong.\n\nThe first time I visited Dustin\u2019s \u201cbachelor pad,\u201d I couldn\u2019t find a spoon for my morning cereal. I searched all the top drawers and only found random packs of ketchup, matches, magnets from real-estate agents and stacks of takeout menus. So I searched the middle drawers. Nothing but tin foil and a screwdriver \u2014 a screwdriver? \u2014 there.\n\nFinally, I found the utensils, in the very bottom drawer next to the oven. They were loose, and they smashed against the wood of the drawer when I pulled it open.\n\nI had no idea my husband was this lost without me. We\u2019re talking about laundry detergent under the kitchen sink, trash bags in the bedroom closet and a 30-year supply of styrofoam plates in the pantry.\n\nI have seen what his living conditions would be without my help, and it\u2019s not pretty.\n\nOur house without Dustin is no walk in the park either\n\nAlright, so maybe I keep utensils where they belong back at the homestead, but the house was, in most other ways, only being held together by faith \u2014 and friends who took pity on us \u2014 while Dustin was away.\n\nWho knew that you need to rake snow off the roof after every single storm or that the grass won\u2019t mow itself? I honestly didn\u2019t know the car\u2019s registration needs to be renewed every year, and I\u2019ll be forever sorry for that time Dustin was home and pulled over for my expired plates.\n\nLove knows no boundaries \u2014 or ZIP codes\n\nBefore Dustin left, he famously said, \u201cIf the only thing holding this family together is the fact that we live under the same roof, then we\u2019ve got much bigger problems.\u201d\n\nSure, but we did have several ground rules.\n\n1. We never called the apartment in D.C. \u201chome.\u201d If I texted Dustin and asked, \u201cAre you home from work yet?\u201d he\u2019d reply, \u201cI\u2019m done with work, but I\u2019m at the apartment, not home.\u201d\n\n2. We could tap out at any time with these contractually binding words: \u201cI need you here\u201d and \u201cplease come home.\u201d\n\n3. The kids knew they could call Dad 24/7, even at work and even if \u2014 as in Lindell\u2019s case \u2014 the only thing on their mind was \u201cI like cake.\u201d\n\nTrust is no small thing\n\nWhen we told people our plan to not move the family to D.C., their first question usually was, \u201cIs everything OK \u2014 like, with you and Dustin?\u201d\n\nThis is a dangerous question to ask a man like my husband, a man who once dropped off our son at his new preschool, a former orphanage, and asked the director, \u201cSo, it\u2019s optional to come back and get him at the end of the day, right?\u201d\n\nAll Dustin\u2019s poorly timed jokes aside, the truth is, you need to have a strong marriage to make geo-baching work. (Side note: It also helps to have a teenage son who can mow the lawn, shovel the snow and take out the trash.)\n\nI\u2019ve known Dustin my whole life \u2014 I met him before I met my dad, in fact \u2014 and we\u2019ve been married 16 years. I knew exactly what he was doing at 8:00 p.m. on a Saturday night: dozing on the couch with the remote in his hand.\n\nPlus, any woman who saw his pile of styrofoam plates or the utensils in the bottom drawer would send him back to me immediately, and I know Dustin could say the same about me.\n\nIt has been a long couple of years with many good times sprinkled in, but if geo-baching has taught us anything, it is this: We may love each other the same, no matter the distance, but Dustin and I are better \u2014 cleaner, more organized, less likely to get tickets \u2014 when we are together.\n\nMaine author and columnist Sarah Smiley\u2019s writing is syndicated weekly to publications across the country.
