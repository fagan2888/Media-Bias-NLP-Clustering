The law is headed for review by the Illinois Supreme Court after a trial judge late last month ruled it unconstitutional.\n\nIt may be the most important decision the justices will face in their careers. A pension funding shortfall estimated at more than $100 billion has metastasized into a fiscal crisis for the state. The law in question attempts to reduce the gap in a variety of ways, including reducing cost-of-living increases for retirees and raising the age at which state workers can retire with full pensions.\n\nTrouble is, those measures appear to violate an Illinois constitutional provision declaring state pensions a contract right that can't be \u201cdiminished or impaired.\u201d That was enough for Illinois Circuit Court Judge John Belz to dispatch the statute, writing, \u201cAny attempt to diminish or impair pension rights is unconstitutional.\u201d\n\nBelz's action, along with a Supreme Court ruling last summer on state retiree medical benefits, has many writing off the pension reforms. There's no question the clean, simple logic of Belz's ruling may appeal to the justices. Also, Arizona's Supreme Court followed essentially the same reasoning in striking down similar pension changes under a constitutional provision like Illinois'.\n\nBut neither ruling is binding on the Illinois Supreme Court. And its decision in the medical benefits case didn't address the central argument Illinois Attorney General Lisa Madigan is likely to advance in support of the law.\n\nProfessor Mark Rosen of IIT Chicago-Kent College of Law says \u201cthere's ample leeway\u201d for the court to uphold the pension law if it accepts the principle that even constitutional rights can be limited when necessary to serve an overarching state interest. I suppose the justices could dismiss the argument as airily as Belz did, but a deeper analysis could lead to a different outcome.\n\nPlenty of courts have ruled over the years that important state interests can justify limiting constitutional rights. In fact, the Illinois Supreme Court acknowledged the principle in a 1985 case involving a change in the computation of judicial pensions that left some judges with lower benefits. The constitution \u201cdoes not immunize contractual obligations from every conceivable kind of impairment or from the effect of a reasonable exercise by the states of their police power,\u201d the court said in Felt v. Board of Trustees. The court invalidated the law because the state failed to show it was necessary to advance an important state interest.\n\nA similar line of analysis in the pension case would lead justices to consider whether the reforms serve an important state interest. In the Felt case, the court said, \u201cThe state has an undeniable interest and responsibility in ensuring the adequate funding of state pension systems.\u201d\n\nThe pension reforms are intended to advance the same state interest. But are they \u201creasonable\u201d?\n\nProfessor Ann Lousin of John Marshall Law School says it depends on what other options legislators might have used that would have less impact on the constitutionally protected benefits. Lousin thinks this is where the state's argument breaks down, noting legislators could raise money to pay full pension benefits by hiking taxes and/or cutting spending (however politically distasteful that may be to lawmakers).\n\nThat's why she gives the pension reform \u201csomewhere around the chance of a snowball in hell.\u201d\n\nShe may have the odds about right. On the other hand, it's a judgment call. There's no telling which way the court will go, but it will find legal support in either direction.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#2d89ef", "timeCrawled": "20160526_10:06:12", "twitter": {"image": "http://www.chicagobusiness.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/CG/20141206/ISSUE10/312069990/AR/0/AR-312069990.jpg&maxw=400", "site": "@CrainsChicago", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Illinois Supreme Court could rule that pension reform is, indeed, constitutional"}, "published_at": "2014-12-6", "url": "http://www.chicagobusiness.com/article//ISSUE10/312069990", "description": "Visit Crain's Chicago Business for complete business news and analysis including healthcare, real estate, manufacturing, government, sports and more.", "byline": "Joe Cahill", "title": "Illinois Supreme Court could rule that pension reform is, indeed, constitutional", "taxo_People": "Lisa Madigan", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=571426684", "taxo_Writers": "Joe Cahill on Business", "image": "http://www.chicagobusiness.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/CG/20141206/ISSUE10/312069990/AR/0/AR-312069990.jpg", "categoryName": "MAG - Cahill", "fb": {"admins": 100001125868754}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/assets/icons/mstile-144x144.png", "content_type": "article", "taxo_Companies": "John Marshall Law School", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no, minimal-ui", "taxo_Sections": "Opinion & Columnists", "taxo_Industries": "Taxes", "summary": "Conventional wisdom is Illinois' pension reform plan will be struck down by the Illinois Supreme Court as unconstitutional.
