Luckily, it appears everyone has recovered.\n\nThe outcome could have been worse. But it also could have been better. Much better.\n\nThe carbon monoxide leak could have been detected if Wisconsin had a law requiring detectors at ice rinks.\n\nMichael Fatis, president of the Rochester, Minn., Ice Hawks, one of the teams sickened on Saturday, told the Rochester Post-Bulletin that the incident makes a good case for Wisconsin to adopt a law similar to Minnesota's, which states: \"Owners or operators of indoor ice arenas must measure carbon monoxide and nitrogen dioxide air concentrations in each arena when internal combustion engine-powered ice maintenance equipment is used.\"\n\nWe couldn't agree more.\n\nWhen you operate the combustion engine of an ice-resurfacing machine in an enclosed area, it seems a no-brainer to have a device that detects carbon monoxide and nitrogen dioxide leaks.\n\nMany of us know of carbon monoxide poisoning, but nitrogen dioxide is also a danger.\n\nNitrogen dioxide, a gas produced when fuel is burned, was blamed when members of the Green Bay Notre Dame boys hockey team were sickened about a year ago at the De Pere Ice Arena.\n\nDon Chilson, manager of the De Pere Ice Arena and Cornerstone Community Center in Ashwaubenon, said both rinks have detectors for carbon monoxide and nitrogen dioxide. At the time, the De Pere rink had detectors for both. It tested continuously for carbon monoxide but not nitrogen dioxide.\n\nAfter that incident, several organizations came together to raise money for an electric-powered ice resurfacer at the rink. That alleviates the gas problem, but electric machines are more expensive than gas-powered ones, so they're not economically feasible for all facilities.\n\nSince the incident, the Lake Delton ice rink has installed eight carbon monoxide detectors.\n\nIt shouldn't take an incident like this, or one with fatal results, for ice rinks to take action, but if such facilities won't install detectors, we call on the Legislature to compel them to do so. We don't like legislating common sense, but dozens of people at one of these events can be sickened, or worse.\n\nLegislators should pass a law requiring detectors that will continuously monitor carbon monoxide and nitrogen dioxide levels.\n\nIt might not prevent all incidents, but the possible consequences of no action are chilling.\n\n\u2014 Green Bay Press-Gazette\n\nRead or Share this story: http://wdhne.ws/1zI7giB", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "The requirement is a no-brainer when using a combustion-engine powered machine indoors.", "og": {"site_name": "Daily Herald Media", "description": "The requirement is a no-brainer when using a combustion-engine powered machine indoors.", "title": "Ice rinks need carbon monoxide detectors: Other View", "url": "http://www.wausaudailyherald.com/story/opinion/2015/01/02/ice-rinks-need-carbon-monoxide-detectors-view/21184165/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/wausaudailyherald.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The requirement is a no-brainer when using a combustion-engine powered machine indoors.", "title": "Ice rinks need carbon monoxide detectors: Other View", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/58078e846cc867116005ea53fa271c2bd909bc8e/c=475-0-2375-1900&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/Wausau/2015/01/02/B9315715679Z.1_20150102104718_000_GO69I9D5U.1-0.jpg", "creator": "@wausauherald", "site": "@wausauherald", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=884268453", "fb": {"app_id": 187427251271455}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070"}, "article_summary": "Officials discovered the culprits to be a propane-fueled ice-resurfacing machine and the lack of any carbon monoxide detectors in the ice rink.\nThe carbon monoxide leak could have been detected if Wisconsin had a law requiring detectors at ice rinks.\nDon Chilson, manager of the De Pere Ice Arena and Cornerstone Community Center in Ashwaubenon, said both rinks have detectors for carbon monoxide and nitrogen dioxide.\nSince the incident, the Lake Delton ice rink has installed eight carbon monoxide detectors.\nLegislators should pass a law requiring detectors that will continuously monitor carbon monoxide and nitrogen dioxide levels."}
