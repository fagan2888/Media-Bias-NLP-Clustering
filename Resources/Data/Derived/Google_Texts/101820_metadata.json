The landmark health reform act that was signed into law by President Barack Obama in 2010 has reduced the revenues of healthcare providers, and forced them to do more with less income.\n\nBut these make-or-break constraints have become drivers for design innovation, and hospitals are looking to commercial enterprises for inspiration. For a new outpatient care facility at the University of Minnesota, CannonDesign looked to IKEA, Starbucks and Apple.\n\n\u201cUntil ObamaCare, I had never heard clients ask that we needed to do things differently,\u201d says Pukszta, who has been building hospitals for over 30 years. \u201cThe typical hospital [profit] margin right now is about 2 to 3%, but if they continue doing things as they\u2019re doing them now, all the smartest advisers in the world predict that within the next 6 or 7 years, their margin will be negative 20%\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cThey realize they have to change or they will go out of business. This is survival mode more than anything.\u201d\n\nThe University of Minnesota Ambulatory Care Center (CannonDesign)\n\nTo make sure that the design solutions are clinically sound, CannonDesign employs a cadre of practicing doctors on its full-time staff, working hand in hand with architects, business analysts, and researchers.\n\nHere are some of the modifications the firm made to its design and planning process, inspired by private industry:\n\nIKEA: Start with the price tag\n\nTo manage costs, the team looked to IKEA\u2019s philosophy of determining the price tag first, then designing the product\u2019s specifications to meet that price point. For instance, for a chair to be sold at $100 retail, IKEA\u2019s product developers and designers would consider how best to use existing production equipment; how to work with suppliers for parts and raw materials; and how to create the best, most inspired and sustainable design to meet that fixed price point.\n\nPrice conscious. (Reuters/Toby Melville)\n\nSimilarly, the University of Minnesota knew that it had no more than $160 million to spend on a new facility when it started the project. Pukszta\u2019s team was asked to propose the best possible scenario working with that hardline budget number in mind\u2014a reversal of the usual design process, in which clients outline their wish list and a budget is drawn afterwards.\n\nApple store: Faster transactions, better experiences\n\nThe new building will have almost half the number of exam rooms (250, reduced from 450 in their old facility) but it will need to accommodate twice as many people. To achieve this, the architects at CannonDesign looked not only to brick-and-mortar solutions, but also worked to tweak the mechanics and flow of the customer experience in the facility.\n\nEasy in, easy out. (Reuters/David Gray)\n\nLike the efficient check out system at Apple\u2019s retail stores, powered by mobile devices, greeters will meet patients as they enter and check them in using tablets. Because transactions can be done via tablets, the building has no reception desks nor dedicated check-in/check-out counters.\n\nAs patients walk in, reception staff can pull up their health records on their tablets and update their information as they walk the patients right to the exam room or to a lounge area. \u201cThe lounges are filled with places where they can learn about health so you can educate them at the same time,\u201d notes Pukszta.\n\nCheck-outs are also streamlined, with the scheduling of follow-up appointments and even ordering the valet to retrieve a patient\u2019s car all done on the tablets in the exam room.\n\nStarbucks: Cool, communal workspaces\n\nThe new ambulatory care center\u2014a five-story, 330,000-square-foot building\u2014has no private offices. Doctors work in open offices, like many tech companies. This is in response to research showing that private doctor\u2019s offices eat up 30 to 40% of a facility\u2019s real estate, Pukszta explains\u2014and they actually remain unoccupied 90% of the time.\n\nCaf\u00e9 culture. (Reuters/Andrew Winning)\n\nAware of the raging backlash against poorly-considered open-office workspaces, CannonDesign paid close attention to the interior design, to make the communal office area desirable. \u201cThe client said that they wanted to make this the coolest spot physicians want to come to on campus, despite the fact that they can\u2019t give them any offices,\u201d Pukszta said.\n\nThe firm built a space inspired by the artful and cozy vibe of Starbucks caf\u00e9s. \u201cIt has comfortable seating with lounges and chairs, coffee bars,\u201d Pukszta said. \u201cIt\u2019s three stories tall, all interconnected by atriums and stairs.\u201d\n\nLike better open-office schemes, the doctor\u2019s area has social, collaborative and private spaces to accommodate various types of interactions. \u201cThis is what we\u2019re learning from the business industry\u2014you don\u2019t need a ton of square footage for offices, you just need to make them cool.\u201d\n\n(CannonDesign)\n\nThe University of Minnesota Ambulatory Care Center is scheduled to be ready to receive patients by early next year.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The healthcare industry used to be in a bubble, says architect Michael Pukszta.
