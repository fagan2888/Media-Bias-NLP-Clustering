(Joe Burbank/Orlando Sentinel) (Joe Burbank)\n\nWell, that and neon is cool.\n\n\"Look, see!\" said Ruggiero as the Parisian Cleaners sign began to glow. \"In a way, they're like Tiffany glass. You have to put light on it!\"\n\nMany of the signs were designed by the same man, Bob Galler of Graphics Systems Inc. of Orlando. Galler really didn't get his due until after his death last year, when one of his most beloved creations, the Merita Bread sign overlooking Interstate 4 in Orlando, was taken down from its perch in November.\n\n\"There's so much emotion and sentiment tied to it,\" said Catherine Hinman, director of public affairs. \"It wasn't just about the sign. You can never separate the aroma [of bread] from the sign. And for most people, it meant 'home.'\"\n\nThe Merita sign arrived, as many of the signs do, in pieces, a little rusty and worn for wear and heavier and far more electronically complicated than most people would imagine.\n\n\"It takes 14 circuits just to do one side, 28 circuits altogether to run both sides,\" said building manager Tom Mobley of the difficulties of rehabilitating the 18-foot-high, 30-foot-long sign.\n\n\"That, and it's 17,000 pounds.\"\n\nEventually, the gigantic sign will work as well as another of the Morse's largest signs, the sky-blue neon logo of the once enormously popular Ronnie's Restaurant \u2014 itself requiring 100 amps to be lit up, compared with 150 amps for an entire house.\n\nSeparated into sections, each with wheels, the sign can be lowered and taken apart for easy transport in case the signs are ever exhibited.\n\n\"We want to be ready for the day we can do that,\" Ruggiero said.\n\nUntil that happens, staffers and visitors can reminisce about the mostly vanished businesses once fronted by the signs.\n\n\"It was a real New York deli, the genuine article,\" Ruggiero said of Ronnie's, the famous Colonial Plaza restaurant that closed in the mid-1990s. \"It wasn't any of this modern, marketed stuff. Just a good old-fashioned deli \u2026. A real '40s-'50s kind of place.\"\n\nMany described the service as sort of endearingly rude, but local historian Joy Dickinson was more diplomatic about its the strict rules and grudging service:\n\n\"It had a lot of character.\"\n\nMcNamara Pontiac's red, white and yellow sign, complete with an Indian head silhouette, was made of porcelain, while The Fairbanks Inn sign was a remnant of when the Winter Park club hosted Battle of the Bands in its parking lot.\n\nSome signs had to be restored to their former glory. When the museum acquired Club Juana's diamond-speckled neon sign, \"it didn't look like much,\" Ruggiero said. \"But the Morse Museum had the insight to know that when they took off the lavender from the '50s and '60s, we got to the true Las Vegas [style] original design.\"\n\nClub Juana in Casselberry was famous for its \"nude Shakespeare,\" Ruggiero said \u2014 \"MacBuff?\" as Hinman recalled one production \u2014 but was considered a legitimate theater in its time.\n\nThough maybe not the nearby Circus Circus, \"A Gentlemen's Club,\" as its big-top, neon-flag-bedecked sign proclaimed.\n\nA number of signs were stacked against the wall: the Runestone, a Winter Park toy store; a Best Western crown; and the uber-'60s zigzag sign for Orlando's all-you-could-eat lobster hot spot, Gary's Duck Inn.\n\n\"And we've got the duck,\" Ruggiero said.\n\nIf you followed the massive block letters of Leedy's Around the Corner, a Winter Park store that sold everything from fabrics to lingerie, you would find smaller, but no less significant, signs.\n\nThere's Enzor's, the throwback drugstore in downtown Orlando where politicians, judges, lawyers and reporters gathered for eggs and coffee. The coffee stopped brewing at Enzor's, which opened in 1925, to make room for the 25-story Orange County Courthouse.\n\nAnd there's the latest arrival, the sign for Winter Park's recently closed Red Fox Lounge.\n\nThe most stunning of all is the first large sign ever acquired. Dating from the 1920s, Orlando's Orange Court Motor Lodge displayed its white neon sign inside a giant, green emblem with dancing, sparkling lights.\n\nIt looked as though you could open it up and champagne would pour out.\n\n\"The active light quality is just so overwhelming,\" Ruggiero said, entranced. \"It's wonderful, just terrific. It's just happy, isn't it?\"\n\nWhen could the collection be displayed?\n\nThere's no time frame, but Ruggiero said, half-seriously, that \"what we'd love to do is put them on the exterior of the building.\"\n\nHinman said they were recently sent a Photoshop rendering of the Merita sign plastered across the museum's Park Avenue entrance.\n\nBut Winter Park's code enforcement need not worry.\n\n\"We got a big kick out of that,\" Hinman joked. \"But that's never going to happen.\"\n\nslemongello@tribune.com or 407-418-5920", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Museum collects neon blast from Orlando's past", "googlebot": "index", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Orlando Sentinel", "author": "Orlando Sentinel", "og": {"site_name": "OrlandoSentinel.com", "description": "Looking for a sign from the past?", "title": "Museum collects neon blast from Orlando's past", "url": "http://www.orlandosentinel.com/news/breaking-news/os-morse-museum-sign-collection-20150123-story.html", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-54c2c385/turbine/os-morse-museum-sign-collection-20150123", "type": "article"}, "x-servername": "lalvp16.17", "twitter": {"site": "@orlandosentinel", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "AAC9C18F70AC386BC4DCF4DDF9BF1786", "robots": "index,follow", "keywords": "Orlando signs Morse Museum", "fb": {"admins": 100004353067097, "page_id": 5779052556, "app_id": 890804050949750}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=402223551, app-argument=http://www.orlandosentinel.com/deeplinkid/82617171", "googlebot-news": "index", "date": "2015-01-23", "Description": "A vast collection of classic signs from Orlando's past remains hidden away at Charles Hosmer Morse Museum of American Art.", "y_key": "fb73650ad672fe45", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "Orlando signs Morse Museum"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fccf9a\"", "article_summary": "Of course, whether your fondest memories include the Circus Circus Gentlemen's Club is up to you.\nDating from the 1920s, Orlando's Orange Court Motor Lodge displayed its white neon sign inside a giant, green emblem with dancing, sparkling lights.\nA variety of vintage neon signs are displayed as Dr. Larry Ruggiero, director of the Charles Hosmer Morse Museum of American Art, lead's a tour in the museum's private warehouse, Thursday, January 15, 2015.\nHugh McKean, the museum's original director, started the collection in the 1970s, mostly with smaller signs from Winter Park.\nWhen the museum acquired Club Juana's diamond-speckled neon sign, \"it didn't look like much,\" Ruggiero said."}
