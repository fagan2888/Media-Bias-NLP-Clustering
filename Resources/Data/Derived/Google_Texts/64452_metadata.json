So we started to cook some chili for them to help raise him some money. And the first year we did it we raised $750 and the family said give it to the fire department,\" said Jay Abbott, St. George Fire Chief.\n\nOther festivities included a live auction where the fire chief says they've raised about $25,000.\n\nAll who participated in the cook-off will be judged and be able to move on to another chili cook-off contest.
