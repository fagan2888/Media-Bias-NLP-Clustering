That\u2019s the question in a California court case, and it\u2019s a question addressed in a new paper by Princeton economist and former Obama Council of Economic Advisers head Alan Krueger and former Deputy Secretary of Labor Seth Harris. Krueger and Harris say the answer is a little of column A, a little of column B. But for everything in column A that might make supporters of decent labor standards smile\u2014that \u201cgig economy\u201d workers should benefit from discrimination laws and have the right to unionize\u2014there\u2019s something shockingly bad\u2014like that these workers shouldn\u2019t get minimum wage protections. Steven Greenhouse has questions:\n\nKrueger and Harris say that on-demand companies shouldn\u2019t be required to provide workers\u2019 compensation for their workers; instead the two authors say companies should be able to opt into workers\u2019 comp as they wish. They note that Uber and Lyft drivers are insured by their own car insurance, so they might not need workers\u2019 comp if they get into an accident while driving a passenger. But shouldn\u2019t these drivers have workers\u2019 comp\u2019 coverage in case they, while opening a door for a passenger, slip on the ice and break a hip or elbow? Or if they slip a disc while removing heavy luggage from the trunk? Or if an inebriated passenger punches them out and injures them? And what if a GrubHub delivery worker on a bicycle is struck by a car and sent to the hospital? Or what if a Caviar or GrubHub delivery worker has to go the hospital after being mugged and robbed while making a delivery in a tough part of town? Krueger and Harris say that without workers\u2019 comp, workers can always sue under tort law, but that wouldn\u2019t be a satisfactory alternative in many cases, especially when workers need immediate hospital care and replacement income. (Remember, a high percentage of on-demand workers don\u2019t have health insurance.) [...] Would this new category of independent workers be covered by the paid sick day laws in various cities? Dedicated drivers who drive 10 or 12 hours a day, often five or six days a week, why shouldn\u2019t they be covered by these sick day laws?\n\nThe National Employment Law Project\u2019s Rebecca Smith points out some of the glaring contradictions in Krueger and Harris\u2019 argument:\n\nTheir proposal mixes and matches the rights traditionally associated with employment, saying that workers in the on-demand economy should have protection from discrimination, but no right to a minimum wage; that their employers should have to pay Social Security taxes, but not workers' compensation or unemployment insurance taxes. In their world, these workers would have no right to employer-provided health insurance under the Affordable Care Act and no protection against dangerous conditions at work. Businesses would pay a 5 percent payroll tax to finance health insurance subsidies, pooling these contributions and creating a private system of portable benefits.\n\nIf Uber and TaskRabbit and the like can\u2019t compete while paying their workers the minimum wage, they can\u2019t compete.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Daily Kos", "description": "Is an Uber driver an employee or an independent entrepreneur who happens to use the Uber platform (and is subject to discipline by Uber,\u00a0has his or her fares set by Uber, and so on)?
