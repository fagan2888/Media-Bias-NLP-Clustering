This includes supporting healthcare reform and the repeal of Obamacare, tax reform, second amendment rights, and of course gay rights: basically, Log Cabin Republican advance any issue where there is an LGBT case to be made, Angelo said. This doesn\u2019t, however, include abortion, another hot-button social and political issue. Angelo, who is pro-life, sees the case for marriage equality and the abortion issue as two topics that have little to do with one another.\n\nAngelo is hesitant to be too harsh against those in his party who do not support gay marriage. \u201cSome conservatives could do a better job on the messaging front when it comes to gay issues and expressing a greater sensitivity to gay Americans and the reality that same-sex marriage exists in this country,\u201d he said. \u201cNone of the doom and gloom that was predicted by opponents of marriage equality has come to pass.\u201d\n\nIn fact, Angelo said he believes that there has been good progress the past few years for the LGBT community within the GOP. He points out Senator Rob Portman, who reversed his stance against gay marriage in 2013 after learning that his son is gay. \u201cThere's more support for these issues among Republicans than the general narrative gives them credit for,\u201d Angelo said. \u201cThere's also less political risk in supporting those things that I think most Republicans are willing to believe.\u201d\n\nAngelo thinks that Republicans could become leaders abroad for gay rights issues. \u201cThere's a way for conservatives to express\u2014even though there might be divisions, philosophical differences on something like marriage\u2014we should be able to coalesce around the notion that someone should not be targeted for death just because of their sexual orientation,\u201d he said. He hopes his panel on the abuses of the LGBT community in Russia will spur fellow conservatives to gay rights causes abroad.\n\nAs the millennial generation begins to dominate the voting population\u2014a majority of which supports gay marriage\u2014perhaps Angelo and Log Cabin Republicans will have more time to take their fight overseas without the distraction of the fight at home. In the meantime, Angelo said Log Cabin Republicans will work towards full sponsorship at the next CPAC.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "//assets.newrepublic.com/assets/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "Gregory T.
