Some insurers said they were doing fine, and the biggest insurers reported solid 2014 profits.

The MFA analysis does not give any information about the percentage of insurers that suffered underwriting losses in 2014, or how those loss totals compare with 2013 underwriting loss totals.

But the analysts did find that seven of the top 10 carriers in the individual market had to pay rebates for their 2014 business. In the small-group and large-group markets, only half of the carriers had to pay rebates.
