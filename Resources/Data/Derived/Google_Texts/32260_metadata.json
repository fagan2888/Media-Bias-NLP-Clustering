I don\u2019t know if the growth is driving health care. It\u2019s driving the economy, but if it\u2019s growing at a young age its not necessarily high utilizers of health care services.\u201d\n\nConway Regional\u2019s admissions have stayed relatively flat since 2007, despite Faulkner County\u2019s growing population.\n\n\u201cThe number of people accessing health care out of our market share is not growing,\u201d Lambert said.\n\n\u201cWe can track how many people out of our market share got a hospital stay in a year and how many we got, so our share of that market is staying the same and our admissions are staying relatively the same, that means to me, the total pie or market is staying the same as far as hospital admissions,\u201d he said.\n\nLambert said he thinks these numbers are caused by the technological advancements in health care as well as an increase in preventative care.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see hospital admissions in our market growing despite population growth,\u201d he said.\n\nBaptist Health President and CEO Troy Wells said Baptist Health is building a hospital in Conway to not only serve Faulkner County, but the four to five surrounding counties including Perry, Conway, Van Buren, Cleburne and White.\n\nConway is a natural funnel for the communities to the north, Lambert said, and Conway Regional has always served those communities.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to work hard to keep their trust and earn their choice,\u201d Lambert said.\n\nCOLLABORATIVE PARTNERSHIP\n\nWells said he sees Baptist Health\u2019s presence in Conway as a \u201cregional partnership.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur ability to impact health and well being depends on our ability to work with other organizations and hospitals some times that means government, schools . . .\u201d\n\nAt this point, Wells said, he could not comment on a collaborative partnership with Conway Regional because of the hospital\u2019s affiliation discussions with St. Vincent Health Systems of Little Rock.\n\nIn May, the Conway Regional Health System Board of Directors announced plans to enter into \u201cexclusive strategic affiliation discussions\u201d with St. Vincent.\n\nLambert said it\u2019s hard to speculate what a collaborative partnership might look like between Conway Regional and Baptist Health, but for example he said he\u2019s heard the hospital is talking about not having an open-heart program to start with.\n\n\u201cI could see them possibly wanting to send their heart patients from their cath lab to [Conway Regional] versus sending them down to Little Rock \u2014 that would be a collaboration,\u201d he said. \u201cWhether we do that or not I don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nSERVICES\n\nLambert said he\u2019s curious to see if Baptist Health will use their Conway facility to stabilize, treat and transfer to a larger hospital in Little Rock or if they\u2019ll grow the hospital to offer as many services as some of their larger hospitals in the capitol city.\n\nWells said Baptist Health Medical Center \u2013 Conway will be a full-service community hospital.\n\n\u201cPatients will not have to leave Conway for care,\u201d he said. \u201cThe strategy is not to get them in and send them to \u2018Big Baptist.\u2019\u201d\n\nAlthough Baptist Health Medical Center \u2013 Conway will be a full-service community hospital, Wells said, it doesn\u2019t mean Baptist Health will be able to meet every need at that facility.\n\nFor example, with a Level III trauma-center emergency room, Wells explained, it must be understood that some of the more seriously injured patients will have to be transferred to another hospital.\n\n\u201c[The Arkansas State Trauma System] will tell us where they must go for care,\u201d he said. \u201cThey won\u2019t be able to stay [at Baptist Health Medical Center \u2013 Conway] for that level of trauma care.\u201d\n\nSo far, Baptist Health has not indicated what services will be offered at the new facility. Wells said the services would be dependent in part on the physicians that make up the staff.\n\n\u201cOver time the physicians we\u2019re working with will help determine what services will be provided,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll evaluate the services that are not being met locally that could be, and those that are not being met well.\u201d\n\nWells said he could not speculate if Baptist Health patients who needed services not offered at Baptist Health Medical Center \u2013 Conway would be sent to another Baptist Health facility in Little Rock.\n\n\u201cThose decisions are made between doctors and patients,\u201d he said.\n\nLambert said having two 150-bed hospitals isn\u2019t the same as having one 300-bed hospital in terms of the services they can offer and the economies of scale they have.\n\nLambert said splitting patients between two hospitals, that could potentially offer the same services, could result in more patients having to go to Little Rock.\n\nFor example, Lambert said, if open-heart surgery patients are split between the two hospitals, and open-heart surgery is no longer a viable service for Conway Regional, from a quality and cost perspective, the hospital may have to stop providing that service.\n\n\u201cInstead of losing half the patients, the community would lose all open heart surgery patients,\u201d he said.\n\nCOMPETITION\n\nWells said in any community and in any case, competition will make the end result better.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s always competition,\u201d he said, \u201ceven within Baptist Health, but at the end of the day we\u2019re trying to make health care better in this community.\u201d\n\nLambert agrees that competition will improve the market, he said, but bringing Baptist Health to Conway won\u2019t change Conway Regional\u2019s focus to provide high-quality compassionate care everyday regardless of \u201cwho\u2019s across town,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve already been competing with them for the past 75 years,\u201d he said, \u201cso we feel like we already compete with them on a daily basis. They\u2019re only 20-odd something miles down the road.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf it increases our focus on improving, then we haven\u2019t been focused enough,\u201d Lambert said.\n\nLambert said bringing Baptist closer might mean the two hospitals will have to disperse additional resources on advertising and marketing \u2014 resources that could have been used for health care.\n\nPHYSICIANS\n\nTwo hospitals will be a major change for local physicians, giving them more options and the challenges that come with it.\n\n\u201cPeople like choice,\u201d Lambert said. \u201cCompetition is the American way, and people like that and see it as a positive, but it could also have some negative outcomes that aren\u2019t necessarily going to be that advantageous,\u201d he said.\n\nLocal physicians will have to make their rounds at two hospitals when they\u2019ve been accustomed to just one, Lambert said.\n\n\u201cThey will have to learn the systems and process of two different places, but on a positive note they will have choices,\u201d he said.\n\nThere\u2019s going to be pros and cons that come out of having a two-hospital town, Lambert said.\n\nFor example, Lambert said, access to physicians and health care is an issue, and a second hospital may bring more doctors into the community, but it may make it more difficult to recruit because a lot of doctors liked coming to this community because it only had one hospital, he said.\n\nLambert said he expects the majority of doctors will cover both hospitals, but there are doctors within the same practice who are divided on whether Baptist Health coming to Conway will be a positive thing for the community.\n\n\u201cIf one of your partners wants to go to [Baptist Health] and do cases, then either you break up the group or you agree to cover, and I think most of them will agree to cover,\u201d Lambert said.\n\nDr. Benjamin M. Dodge, an orthopedic surgeon of Conway, said at the groundbreaking on July 7, that Baptist Health Medical Center \u2013 Conway was a culmination of many years of hard work by a core group of physicians.\n\n\u201cThis group of physicians has worked closely with Baptist Health and its administration to help get us where we are today,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have been impressed with Baptist Health\u2019s integrity, we\u2019ve been impressed with Baptist Health\u2019s insight into the health care needs of Arkansans and we have been impressed with Baptist Health\u2019s professional manner and how we\u2019ve worked through this process.\u201d\n\nLambert said he doesn\u2019t see those physicians \u201cmass exiting Conway Regional.\u201d\n\nWells said he expects some physicians to practice exclusively at Baptist Health and some physicians to continue to practice exclusively at Conway Regional.\n\n\u201cOthers will maintain privileges at both, going back and forth, along with the challenges that come with it,\u201d he said.\n\nFUTURE\n\nWith health care reimbursement transitioning from a fee for service system, in which providers such as Medicare and Medicaid pay based on the number of services, to a system where providers are paid based on improving outcomes, hospitalization will not necessarily be the best way to manage care.\n\n\u201cThe goal of that is if I\u2019m going to get \u2018xyz dollars\u2019 and I\u2019m supposed to take care of your healthcare,\u201d Lambert said, \u201cI\u2019m going to try to keep you well, I\u2019m going to try to keep you out of the hospital and I\u2019m going to try to make sure you take care of yourself.\u201d\n\nLooking at the future, nationally, healthcare is moving toward population health management, accountable care and bundled payment, putting hospitals and providers at risk for all of the community not just patients, so providers must consider managing a community\u2019s care across the continuum.\n\n\u201cYou have to keep your costs down so you can make sure you can manage risks and you want to keep people in environments that are less costly,\u201d Lambert said, \u201cand the hospital is the most costly environment you\u2019ve got.\u201d\n\nWith Arkansas being the third most obese state in the nation, both Conway Regional and Baptist Health have initiatives in place to promote wellness and fight obesity.\n\nConway Regional Health & Fitness Center is considered one of the largest hospital-based fitness centers in the nation at 70,000 square feet and with more than 7,000 members.\n\nBaptist Health partners with churches in the community to provide health promotion and prevention activities to medically underserved, uninsured and underinsured individuals through their Baptist Health Community Wellness Center initiative.\n\nWells said Baptist Health plans to improve the health care and well being of the community by providing faith-based health care and working closely with physicians and patients in clinics, hospitals \u2014 \u201c and not just in the hospital walls, but in their homes,\u201d he said.\n\nBaptist Health Medical Center \u2013 Conway is projected to open in the first quarter of 2016 with 96 beds, eight operating rooms and a Level III trauma-center emergency room.\n\n(Staff writer Michelle Corbet can be reached by email at michelle.corbet@thecabin.net or by phone at 505-1215.
