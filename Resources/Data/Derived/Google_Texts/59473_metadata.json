Simplifying common workflows by deploying easy-to-use mobile apps will free nearly 17,500 hours a month that can be invested into the children and families they serve.\n\nKVC provides in-home family support, foster care, adoption, behavioral healthcare and other services that touch the lives of nearly 60,000 children and families each year across four states. Due to KVC\u2019s commitment to providing therapy and other support in the family\u2019s home as opposed to in an office setting, 92 percent of its workforce is mobile, currently using multiple methods to capture client data, including paper forms or digital applications, that is then oftentimes required to be reentered into the company\u2019s digital databases.\n\nRecent healthcare reforms, including the Affordable Care Act\u2019s Meaningful Use requirements, are putting increased pressure on healthcare organizations to minimize the amount of resources devoted to administrative tasks. To meet this challenge while remaining HIPAA compliant, KVC employees can now submit reports in real time and on-the-go on mobile devices, no longer needing to return to the office at the end of the day to manually enter all reports. This allows both direct service staff and managers to focus more energy and resources providing customer care instead of focusing on administrative tasks and approval processes.\n\n\u201cThe vast majority of our team is mobile and needs to be able to collect data on-the-go in a HIPAA and state compliant manner. However, current reporting methods are very resource intensive and often require more steps than necessary,\u201d said Lonnie Johnson, Vice President of Business Information Technology at KVC Health Systems. \u201cAnother important consideration is the time it takes for data collected in the field to be entered and acted upon. Capriza mobilizes our workflows, allowing employees to enter client information in real time and enabling managers to make decisions before staff have even returned to the office.\u201d\n\nThis mobile transformation functions on existing systems, adding new capabilities to legacy infrastructure. Capriza combines multiple workflows into a single interface, and can alert workers through proactive push notifications. These and additional features can be customized through Capriza\u2019s no-code platform.\n\n\u201cDeveloper resources are limited, so it\u2019s essential we have a platform that nearly everyone can customize to their particular uses,\u201d added Johnson. \u201cWith Capriza, we can easily build Zapps that are fully compliant with state and federal requirements that enable our workers to complete their tasks with a single touch. By modernizing, simplifying and expediting existing digital applications, we expect to see an increase in productivity of up to 20 percent during the next 12 months, which means better care for the individuals we serve.\u201d\n\nCapriza expects these mobile capabilities to become the standard for any government-regulated industry. Companies using a range of source applications, from custom built to SAP, Oracle and Salesforce, can simplify tasks to a single click.\n\n\u201cBy simplifying processes that usually require a computer to something that can be done in a few seconds through a mobile app, we\u2019re helping companies like KVC to spend more time with the families and children they serve,\u201d said Yuval Scarlat, CEO and co-founder of Capriza. \u201cBy enabling employees to enter data in real time, we are streamlining the process and ultimately increasing the quality of care, proving that an increase in productivity can truly change lives.\u201d\n\nAbout Capriza\n\nCapriza modernizes your business by simplifying and mobilizing your critical workflows.
