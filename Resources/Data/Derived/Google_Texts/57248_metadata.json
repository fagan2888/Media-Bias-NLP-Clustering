Married, two children. Expecting fifth and sixth grandchildren soon. Deer Lodge, Mont., native. Also lived in Denver. Has been in Amarillo since 1982. Owns Paul Harpole Motors. Army veteran. Served in Vietnam (1969-71) as helicopter crew chief (medical evacuation). City commissioner from 2004-05 and in third year as mayor.\n\n\u25a0 Best/worst part of being mayor: \u201cThe best part is the people. I go to a lot of events, including kids and schools. They are great to be around. The best part is the support of the community. Honestly, I don\u2019t have a part of the job I don\u2019t enjoy. The more challenging part is the discussions, but I enjoy that. It is important.\u201d\n\n\u25a0 Hobbies/spare time: \u201cI have loved aviation since I was a kid (Harpole has a pilot\u2019s license). I took my first flight at age 15. I was sold instantly. I love it. It is my best release. I also enjoy fly fishing. I\u2019ve sort of become a poster boy for Amarillo College. I took a fly fishing class at AC, a golf class, ballroom dancing with my wife. I even took harmonica lessons at AC.\u201d\n\n\u25a0 Ballroom dancing? Like \u201cDancing With the Stars?\u201d: \u201cThis was prior to \u2018Dancing With the Stars,\u2019 but I do OK. I have two audiences that I play the harmonica for \u2014 grandkids under 6 and people in old folks\u2019 homes over 80. They are easier to entertain, and they don\u2019t leave you as quickly (laughing).\u201d", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Digital Dialogue, Opinion, DAVID HENRY, Owns Paul Harpole Motors, Paul Harpole", "og": {"site_name": "Amarillo Globe-News", "description": "A capsule - and different - look at elected/public officials in the Texas Panhandle. \n \nAmarillo Mayor \nPaul Harpole \n \n\u25a0 The basics: 63 years old.
