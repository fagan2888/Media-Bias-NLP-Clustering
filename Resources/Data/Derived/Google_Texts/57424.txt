Your tax refund could be delayed if you enrolled in the national healthcare exchange last year.

A national taxpayer advocate representative said this was due to Obamacare subsidy payouts.

Some people who enrolled in Obamacare got subsidies based on their estimated 2014 income.

Now that they know their actual income from last year, the IRS has to make sure the numbers all add up.

Some people may get more money back, while others might have to pay the government back.

The IRS said some tax returns that involved Obamacare subsidies were held for review early in the filing season
