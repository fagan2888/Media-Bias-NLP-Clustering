The fund will be used to provide low-interest loans for projects that can create jobs. The fund is expected to become self-sustainable with money paid on existing loans being used to make new loans.\n\nPre-kindergarten programs: $10 million investment to expand the availability of high-quality pre-kindergarten education. The county will work with a variety of community groups to create a $75 million fund to ensure all children have a pre-K education.\n\nWorkforce programs: $3 million to leverage with local and state workforce programs to help people find their first job and to continue to assist them so they can eventually have a sustainable income and climb out of poverty.\n\nBlighted properties: $26 million - $8 million over each of the next three years, along with $1 million each year for two years from the County Prosecutor's Office, to demolish abandoned and blighted buildings.\n\nInfant mortality: $500,000 in 2016 and $1 million in 2017 to reduce infant mortality. The county will work with existing programs, hospitals and organizations and coordinate efforts with Cleveland Mayor Frank Jackson and Cleveland City Council President Kevin Kelley.\n\nPay equity: $1 million to provide additional pay to supervisors whose pay has not increased at the level of county employees represented by unions.\n\nFollowing are proposed reductions.\n\nThe MetroHealth System: The hospital, which received a $4 million annual increase from the county the last two years, will see its $40 million subsidy reduced to $32.4 million a year under Budish's proposal.\n\n\"We believe they can accept that reduction without causing a reduction in services,\" he said.\n\nCounty officials have discussed the budget with CEO Dr. Akram Boutros and hospital officials.\n\nThe hospital has reported a budget surplus, Budish said, and the Affordable Care Act has led to less subsidized care.\n\nAlcohol Drug Addiction and Mental Health Services Board: The board, which received a $5 million annual increase the last two years, will see its $39.3 million annual subsidy reduced to $33.1 million.\n\n\"The board is not the limit of what we do in mental health and addiction services, which are critically important to this community,\" Budish said. \"We support in other ways with millions and millions of dollars.\"\n\nThe board also benefits from the Affordable Care Act and many services are now covered by Medicaid that had not been covered before, he said.\n\n\"We are not anticipating the cuts will affect services,' he said.\n\nCriminal justice reform: The county will work with County Prosecutor Timothy J.McGinty to reduce the time people stay in jail while waiting to post bond or for their cases to move forward. GPS ankle bracelets will be used to monitor people and the prosecutor will shorten the time for grand juries to consider cases. That will save costs.\n\nReduce government expenses: $1.1 million a year will be allocated for a new partnership with the Cleveland Foundation to create an innovation and performance team. The will find ways to reduce the cost of contracts, insurance, utilities and equipment. The savings found by the team will more than cover the budgeted cost, Budish said.\n\nAlign the Department of Child and Family Services and the Department of Job and Family Services: Save $1 million a year by coordinating some operations of the two agencies. The move also is designed to make it easier for those who need services.\n\nEliminating unfilled positions: Count departments for years have submitted budgets that included salaries for unfilled positions. When those jobs aren't filled, the money is used for other expenses.\n\nContracts: Funds will only be provided for only what is spent under a contract. In the past, money left unspent by a contract was used for other purposes.\n\nOther issues discussed by Budish:\n\nMetroHealth plan for growth: The hospital is expected to outline its transformational project later this year.\n\n\"We are committed to support that,\" Budish said. He said the county's annual budget subsidy to the hospital could be used to help pay off bonds for the transformation, which calls for rebuilding much of the MetroHealth's West Side campus.\n\nJustice Center: A study is underway to see what it would cost to build a new Justice Center, including a jail, Budish said. The study, which would include funding options, should be completed by the end of the year.\n\n\"The Justice Center is sitting on the most, in my view, important piece of property in the city of Cleveland,\" he said. \"That property could be much better utilitized.\"\n\nIt would cost hundreds of millions to repair the current building, he said.\n\nHe wasn't sure whether locations would be identified in the study, but he said many areas in the county would be available.\n\nAn earlier version of this story incorrectly stated the proposed percentage that would be cut from the county's mental health board.", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Armond Budish, Cuyahoga County, Ohio, MetroHealth, Cleveland, D\u00fan
