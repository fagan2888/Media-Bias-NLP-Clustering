The election of Hillary Clinton as President in 2016 is essential to the continuation of the work and legacy of President Barack Hussein Obama.

If a Republican President is elected, ObamaCare will be dismantled and discarded. Health care and health care insurance oversight might even be returned to the oversight of the individual states.

Energy production, mining, lumber and wood products harvesting, pipeline construction, electric power generator construction, and food production will dramatically increase on both public and private lands. Gasoline, diesel fuel, electricity, food, fertilizer, petrochemical, construction materials, and other products will have lower production costs and be available in greater abundance.

Our military strength and our national security will be greatly enhanced. We will be increasingly protected against nuclear and terrorist attacks.

Our border will be secured. Obamaâ€™s beloved Islamic Terrorists and drug cartel members will be kept out. People seeking opportunities to work hard will be documented and will be legally protected while working in our nation.

Investments will increase for the creation of new businesses and the expanding of those that exist.

Jobs will increase and employment will be readily available for those who want to work.

During the Obama Presidency, there have been no demonstrable differences between Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama. They are one and the same, and Hillary could be even worse.
