Here are some highlights:\n\nOn Obamacare:\n\n\u201cThey screwed it up but conceptually, it does the right thing. The reason why I\u2019m pro-Obamacare, if you want to put it that way, is because we made the decision as a country that if you\u2019re sick and you go into a hospital, they\u2019ll take care of you whether you can pay for it or not. If someone said to me, ok Mark, we\u2019ve got this problem. We\u2019ve made this decision as a country that anybody can go into a hospital and they have to at least evaluate them and if it\u2019s a medical emergency, they have to take care of them. The way we pay for that is the hospital will send them a bill that they know they won\u2019t pay. Typically, they won\u2019t have insurance so they\u2019re just going into the emergency room for treatment or using our real estate taxes or local, state or federal taxes that pays for it. We don\u2019t want to have to pay for these things one off at a time because that jacks up the price. I would have come back and said ok, you come up with a program that forces everybody to enroll because everybody is at risk to go to the hospital and pay for it as a traditional insurance program as opposed to all the one offs because that\u2019s a more effective way to do it so I like that part about it.\u201d\n\nOn helping produce Enron: The Smartest Guys in the Room:\n\n\u201cIt was quick. It was easy. It was right. Then we started doing the same thing with other movies, and I was horrible. Now, I won\u2019t green light any other movies because I realized I was the Antoine Walker of movies. I hit one three, and I kept on doing more. I should have missed my first three and stopped shooting.\u201d\n\nOn how he\u2019s changed over the years:\n\n\u201cIt used to take me two or three days to get over a loss and now I can sleep it off, and I think a lot of that has to do with by the morning, I\u2019ll see my kids. My focus is a lot more on my kids. My interest is a lot more on my kids so I think that takes away some. But other than that, I think more people have gotten used to me. When I came on the scene, I was kind of the aberration. We had a lot of old school owners in the NBA who if I did something they would call up David Stern and say that\u2019s wrong or do this, things I got fined for are no big deal. It used to be that people want Mark Cuban to be quiet, sit in the owner\u2019s box and shut up and write the checks. Now if there is a new owner or the team is for sale it\u2019s is the new owner going to be like Mark Cuban.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"profile": {"first_name": "SportsDayDFW.com"}, "description": "Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban on Obamacare, being the Antoine Walker of movies, how he's changed", "og": {"site_name": "SportsDay", "description": "Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban on Obamacare, being the Antoine Walker of movies, how he's changed", "title": "Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban on Obamacare, being the Antoine Walker of movies, how he's changed  | SportsDay", "url": "http://sportsday.dallasnews.com/dallas-mavericks/mavericksheadlines/2013/12/26/dallas-mavericks-owner-mark-cuban-on-obamacare-being-the-antoine-walker-of-movies-how-he-s-changed", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://sportsdaydfw.imgix.net/20131221_lbm_as8_296_34898967_221576.JPG?w=1200&h=630&format=jpg&crop=faces&fit=crop", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban on Obamacare, being the Antoine Walker of movies, how he's changed", "title": "Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban on Obamacare, being the Antoine Walker of movies, how he's changed  | SportsDay", "image": "http://sportsdaydfw.imgix.net/20131221_lbm_as8_296_34898967_221576.JPG", "creator": "@SportsDayDFW", "site": "@sportsdaydfw", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#d22d39", "fb": {"admins": 1043783589, "page_id": 20946638799}, "theme-color": "#d22d39", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://sportsdaydfw.imgix.net/favicon-sd.png?fm=png&q=50&bg=d22d39&w=144&h=144", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/sportsdaydfw", "section": "Mavericks Headlines", "published_time": "2013-12-26T20:56:00-06:00", "modified_time": "2013-12-26T20:56:00-06:00"}, "msvalidate.01": "62A04921CC36584B5C73FFED7A1E67D6", "google-site-verification": "jTekCA_uXnGm9Z2Lrjq_KcgQ6RoxQOg9cAyQxnvyx-Y", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Dallas Mavericks basketball, NBA Mavericks, Dirk Nowitzki, Chandler Parsons, Rick Carlisle, JJ Barea, Deron Williams, Satnam Singh, Zaza Pachulia, American Airlines Center"}, "article_summary": "Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban recently joined Norm Hitzges on KTCK-AM to talk about the Mavericks.\nThe way we pay for that is the hospital will send them a bill that they know they won\u2019t pay.\nNow, I won\u2019t green light any other movies because I realized I was the Antoine Walker of movies.\nNow if there is a new owner or the team is for sale it\u2019s is the new owner going to be like Mark Cuban.\u201d\nIt used to be that people want Mark Cuban to be quiet, sit in the owner\u2019s box and shut up and write the checks."}
