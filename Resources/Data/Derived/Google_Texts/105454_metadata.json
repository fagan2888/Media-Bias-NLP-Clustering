The proposal also addresses the treatment of customers\u2019 free credit balances, sweep programs, bulk transfers of customers\u2019 accounts and changes to the broker-dealer of record. FINRA issued its initial proposal in November 2009; the revised proposal addresses comments received from interested persons.\n\nThe comment period on the revised proposal expires on August 17.
