No more guns to protect Hillary! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 21, 2016\n\nTrump\u2019s tweet comes the day after he stood in front of thousands at the NRA Leadership Forum in Louisville, Kentucky, where he described Clinton as \u201cthe most anti-gun, anti-Second Amendment candidate ever to run for office.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cAnd as I\u2019ve said before, she wants to abolish the Second Amendment. She wants to take your guns away.\u201d\n\nTrump said:\n\nHillary wants to disarm vulnerable Americans in high crime neighborhoods. Whether it\u2019s a young single mom in Florida or a grandma in Ohio, Hillary wants them to be defenseless, wants to take away any chance they have of survival. And by the way, you have men and you have women sitting in an apartment, and outside is tremendous crime\u2013tremendous crime of all kinds\u2013and they need to be protected. And you know, the only way they are going to be able to protect themselves, and if you take that gun away from them, it\u2019s going to be a very unfair situation. And that\u2019s why we are going to call her \u201cHeartless Hillary.\u201d\n\nTrump went on to call for Clinton\u2019s body guards to \u201cimmediately disarm\u201d so she can feel the way the defenseless single mom in Florida has to feel on any given night.\n\nAWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and political analyst for Armed American Radio.
