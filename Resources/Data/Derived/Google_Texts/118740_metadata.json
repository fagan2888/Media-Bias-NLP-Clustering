Led by the most corrupt and least transparent president in American history, according to dozens of media stories, Obama\u2013who is a proven Marxist and social-activist himself\u2013seems intent on transforming America from a Constitutional Republic and the greatest beacon of light and freedom on earth to a miserable third-world socialist state, or worse. A very revealing way to judge Obama\u2019s actions as president is made under the lens of his mentor\u2019s handbook for social activism and \u2018change\u2019 titled \u2018Rules For Radicals\u2019.\n\nPart of the Obama agenda that is being levied against Americans by these now-embedded Marxist-socialists involves demonizing America and its heritage, traditions, and culture, while offering \u2018diversity\u2019 in its place: the Utopian Dream. A quick review of what\u2019s happening around America at this very moment clearly shows that this Marxist agenda is actually unfolding before our eyes and demonstrates this is no conspiracy theory.\n\nWell-intentioned Americans were bamboozled into electing a Marxist with an Islamic background as its president.\n\nAdvertisement \u2013 story continues below\n\nFirst: Right out of the gate after taking office, Obama tours the world and publicly downgrades and demeans America, while offering apologies for America\u2019s history.\n\nSecond: Obama promises to be \u2018the most transparent administration in history\u2019 and, even as he pledges this, is busily engaged in doing the exact opposite.\n\nThird: In order to run a shadow government beyond the constitutional purview of the People\u2019s elected representatives in Congress, Obama creates numerous new departments in the government and appoints \u2018Czars\u2019 to head those many departments. Most of these new departments and the Czars who run them are outside the scrutiny of Congress, even though they are spending millions of taxpayer dollars in achieving socialist goals that are in many cases set unilaterally by Obama and his administration.\n\nAdvertisement \u2013 story continues below\n\nFourth: Obama has already begun purging the U.S. military of its leading commanding officers, many of whom are well-proven patriot-heroes and protectors of our Constitution and nation! And as he does, he replaces those commanders with others who are arguably loyal to him and his political agenda, as opposed to the U.S. Constitution and the American People.\n\nFifth: Even though America was founded under Judeo-Christian beliefs, Obama and his administration are taking many steps to expunge the Christian faith from America and seems to support supplanting Christianity throughout America with other non-traditional beliefs.\n\nSixth: Obama and his administration have engaged and inserted themselves into matters and issues that have historically and legally been the jurisdictional responsibility of local state and city governments. And these actions are supplanting and undermining the authority of the duly elected representatives of the People at the local levels of government through their proxies inciting and instigating riots and racial tensions, which Obama and his proxies subsequently deem require Federal attention.\n\nSeventh: Obama seems intent on creating and maintaining a national police force frighteningly reminiscent of Adolf Hitler\u2019s \u2018brown shirts\u2019 in every city of America, which would arguably be under his control. And as that is happening, the DHS seems to be arming itself for WW3 inside America with its recent paramilitary acquisitions. Obama also makes frequent use of the office of the U.S. Attorney General to intervene into local police matters. Seemingly in line with these goals (to literally control the population), Obama also used what has been called his \u2018royal decree\u2019 to ban .223 caliber rifle rounds as a first step in disarming U.S. Citizens and effectively separating them from their 2nd Amendment Constitutional rights to keep and bear arms by eliminating ammunition for those privately-owned guns. This sneaky and underhanded move by Obama is further evidence of his maligned agenda for America and its People.\n\nAdvertisement \u2013 story continues below\n\nEighth: Obama is arguably regularly operating beyond the authority granted to him under the U.S. Constitution and in a manner that on several occasions has effectively suspended Constitutional Law and the powers of Congress. Obama has already acted unilaterally anytime he disagrees with Congress, and seems inclined to continue doing so going forward as his actions fly in the face of the U.S. Constitution.\n\nNinth: As with any systemic disease that is deeply rooted, the Obama administration\u2019s socialist tentacles also reach into schools and universities, where the pace at which \u2018change\u2019 is occurring is alarming. In primary public schools and on university campuses around America, the socialist Common Core programs, which include revisionist history on America and other subversive and immoral teachings, are now propagandizing the children and young adults in America. Obama supporters are now mobilizing efforts to empower political action groups across America in what seems to be a designed effort to undermine the core traditions and culture of America. Even America\u2019s veterans are falling victim to this subversive undercurrent.\n\nTenth: Disenfranchising Americans from their heritage, religious beliefs, heroes, and symbols like the American flag is a battle that fits hand-in-glove with the Marxist-socialist plan for America. Historically, American students would say the \u2018pledge of allegiance\u2019 to the flag of the United States of America at the beginning of the school day; but no more. Through Marxist intervention into our schools, American patriotism is snuffed out at the earliest possible age. This and other literal brainwashing methods are levied on young minds outside the purview of parents, while children are under the control of teachers.\n\nEleventh: Obama has already begun the nationalization of many key sectors of the U.S. Economy. The most recent instance of this was the FCC obtaining control of the Internet. It may just be a matter of time until the government decides which articles you are allowed to see on the Internet; and sites such as Western Journalism may be censored or removed from the Internet, together with all referenced materials.\n\nThe Stock Market also appears to be \u2018rigged\u2019 and kept artificially buoyed by the Federal Treasury. Of course, the nationalization of much of America\u2019s auto industry, as bad as that is, also resulted in huge financial losses to American taxpayers.\n\nObama\u2019s nationalization of health care is Machiavellian throughout, starting with lying to Americans to even get some initial buy-in, even though elected legislators never approved this catastrophic plan. And placing the nationalized health plan under the auspices of the IRS, and allowing them to handle Americans\u2019 confidential health records, is obscene. The entire Obamacare plan is an insult to the integrity and the rights of Americans.\n\nAnd possibly the final nail in the coffin of American freedom may very well be \u2018ObamaLaw\u2019 if it is allowed to proceed as a planned, nationalized police force, replacing locally managed police departments.\n\nI am shocked by the apathy of some Americans, especially the decent-minded Democrats and Independents out there who somehow don\u2019t see the earmarks of a so-called \u2018leader\u2019 who is nothing more than a pathological narcissist with many similarities to Adolf Hitler. What U.S. President names everything after himself (\u2018ObamaLaw\u2019, \u2018Obama-Care\u2019, \u2018Obama-phone\u2019, etc.)?\n\nAmerican patriots are all asking the same question: what can we do about Obama\u2019s disregard for the U.S. Constitution and the rights of Americans thereunder? Do Americans have to \u2018Hope\u2019 we can stop the \u2018Change\u2019 in the next election cycle?\n\nGod help us!\n\nThe views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by the owners of this website.", "article_metadata": {"description": "God help us!", "author": "Capt.
