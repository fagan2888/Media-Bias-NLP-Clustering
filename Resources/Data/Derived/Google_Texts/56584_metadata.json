Chuck Schumer, [was] named White House Legislative Affairs director -- a move intended to shore up a Hill operation that has long needed stronger leadership in the view of many congressional Democrats \u2026 Fallon, a deputy communications director who has been working in the West Wing only since the late summer, will replace the well-liked but little-known Miguel Rodriguez \u2026 [who] is leaving for a job in the private sector \u2026 Fallon, according to West Wing officials, will have much more stature and authority, akin to that enjoyed by Rob Nabors, the former legislative director now serving as an Obama deputy chief of staff. White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough picked her, in part, because of her close ties to Senate Democratic leaders and recently arranged a meeting with between Obama and Fallon to \u2018diagnose the challenges the White House faces with the Hill and come up with a plan for addressing them\u2019 \u2026\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\u201cMcDonough wrote in an email: \u2026 \u2018Katie is whip smart, and fully understands the challenges and opportunities members of Congress face every day. This is an Administration committed to working with members from both parties to find common sense ways to grow the economy for all Americans. There is nobody better suited to lead our efforts on the Hill than Katie.\u2019 McDonough has personally taken pains to improve relationship with the Hill, and members from both sides say he has been much more responsive to phone calls and emails than his recent predecessors. Fallon will spend the next few weeks meeting with members in both houses and will be tasked with pushing Obama\u2019s climate change plans, overseeing the immigration reform push and \u2026 ensuring a better flow of communication around Affordable Care Act messaging \u2026\n\n\u201c[Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said in an email:] \u2018Katie is one of the most intelligent, thoughtful and strategic thinkers I have encountered in the three decades I have served in the Senate \u2026 I have missed working directly with Katie and I look forward to working closely with her again.\u2019 House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) called Fallon \u2018a key partner\u2019 and praised her for \u2018a brilliant understanding of message, communications and policy.\u2019\n\n\u201cThe Fallon promotion also represents the slow, but steady Schumer-ization of the administration: Fallon is married to former Schumerian Brian Fallon, recently appointed to run Attorney General Eric Holder\u2019s communications shop, and works closely with former Schumer spokesman and current Obama Deputy Press Secretary Eric Schultz. Schumer\u2019s 29-year-old daughter, Jessica, recently signed on as chief of staff for Chairman of Economic Advisers Chairman Jason Furman. \u2018There\u2019s nobody -- nobody -- better suited for this job than Katie,\u201d Schumer kvelled in an email.\u201d http://goo.gl/5Cbp8O\n\n--\u201cStatement by the President on the Departure of Miguel Rodriguez\u201d: \u201cMiguel Rodriguez has served in my Administration from day one. After a tour with Secretary Clinton at the State Department, he joined my staff in October 2011 before agreeing to serve as my Director of Legislative Affairs earlier this year. And throughout some of this year\u2019s most contentious legislative battles, Miguel worked tirelessly to bridge the partisan divide, forge consensus, and seek out solutions that helped us move forward. As the son of immigrants, I know Miguel took particular pride in the Senate\u2019s passage of a bipartisan, commonsense immigration reform plan \u2013 something that we are going to see through.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m grateful for his service, and I will miss his advice and counsel, but I am pleased that Katie Beirne Fallon has agreed to serve as my next Director of Legislative Affairs. As a veteran of Congress, and my Deputy Director of Communications, she has the deep expertise and strong relationships required to build on the progress we\u2019ve made this year and advance my top priority: creating jobs and expanding broad-based growth and opportunity for every American.\u201d\n\n--HOW IT'S PLAYING: N.Y.

He was frustrated that these groups came out in opposition to our budget agreement before we reached a budget agreement. I was frustrated, too. But I think these are very important elements of our conservative family. I would prefer to keep those conversations within the family. And I think he was just basically voicing his frustration with their opposition before we had reached our agreement. \u2026 I think these taxpayer groups are indispensable to keeping taxpayer interest accounted for, keeping people accountable.\u201d \u2026\n\nGREGORY: \u201c[D]o Senate Democrats go down next year, especially in the South, over [Obamacare]?\u201d\n\nMURRAY: \u201cI do not believe they will.

Those digital files are known \u2026 as \u2018834 transmissions,\u2019 and they have become the focus of much attention since insurers noticed some arriving with flaws or in duplicate.\u201d http://goo.gl/FsqECR\n\nGLASS HALF FULL \u2013 HHS blog post today, \u201cMissing 834s as Percentage of Enrollment Now Near Zero,\u201d by Julie Bataille, Director of Communications, Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services: \u201c[B]etween October 1st and December 5th, the number of consumers for whom 834s were not produced was fewer than 15,000. \u2026 [S]ince the beginning of December, missing 834s as a percentage of total enrollments has been close to zero. \u2026 To make sure that no consumer falls through the cracks because of earlier pervasive troubles with the site, we are contacting every consumer who has selected a plan through the Federal Marketplace to remind them to pay their premium and connect with their insurer.\u201d http://goo.gl/Z4l5cp\n\nTHIS IS A PROBLEM -- L.A. Times 1-col. lead, \u201cHealth sign-up slow to attract Latinos: The lack of a Spanish application form and a shortage of counselors hamper the California exchange\u2019s effort,\u201d by Chad Terhune and Eryn Brown: \u201cThe state's enrollment so far among Latinos is anemic \u2014 even though they represent more than half of California's 7 million uninsured residents. Only 5% of enrollees, or fewer than 4,500 people, in the first two months of enrollment are primarily Spanish speakers \u2026 [S]upporters of the healthcare law \u2026 fault the Covered California exchange for strategic missteps, and they fear that missing out on this relatively young and healthy population could threaten the viability of the state exchange. \u2026 Covered California officials and healthcare experts \u2026 say a shortage of enrollment counselors has affected Latinos more because so many prefer speaking with someone in person \u2026\n\n\u201cAnother glaring problem is that 10 weeks into enrollment, the state exchange still doesn't have a paper application in Spanish. \u2026 People who speak primarily Spanish account for 29% of California's population, but they represent only 5% of exchange enrollment. The shortfall among Spanish speakers is surprising given the significant amount of marketing targeted at Latinos statewide. In June, President Obama came to California to praise a partnership among the state exchange, the nonprofit California Endowment and major Spanish-language media \u2026 The state exchange said a paper application in Spanish should be available next week. It attributed the long delay to getting government approvals and feedback from outside groups.\u201d http://goo.gl/T7uKSQ\n\nAP FOR SUNDAY PAPERS \u2013 \u201cBloomberg: Unquestioned impact, debated legacy,\u201d by Jonathan Lemire in New York: \u201cWhen Michael Bloomberg took the oath as mayor nearly a dozen years ago, he was a political neophyte \u2026 Bloomberg is now poised to leave office [Jan. 1] having dramatically reshaped the city, from its government to its skyline. \u2026 [H]is innovative public health policies appear to have added years to residents' lives. The city has never been safer or cleaner \u2026 But Bloomberg's approach to governing as the billionaire businessman he is, employing hard data and the free market to drive much of the city's renaissance, sometimes left him without an ability to connect with those who felt left behind. Income inequality grew during his years. The number of homeless has soared. And some ethnic and religious minorities complain that a steep drop in crime has come at the expense of their civil liberties. \u2026\n\n\u201c\u2018He believed you get the data, and you do what you believe is right,\u2019 said Bill Cunningham, the mayor's former communications director. \u2018It was really like an experiment. Will people like someone who does what they believe in and not based on polls?\u2019 Smoking was banned in all bars and restaurants, the first in a series of health innovations that helped change policies nationwide. A hotline, 311, was created to provide real-time information to residents. He wrested control of the city's school system, placing it under City Hall \u2026 He \u2026 commissioned new billion-dollar stadiums for the Yankees and Mets and returned professional sports to Brooklyn with the Nets. Changes in the zoning laws and the falling crime rates sent gentrifiers scurrying into the far reaches of Queens and especially Brooklyn, breathing new life into formerly downtrodden neighborhoods but displacing some resentful longtime residents.\u201d http://goo.gl/SmNGQ6\n\nWHAT HOLLYWOOD IS READING \u2013 L.A.
