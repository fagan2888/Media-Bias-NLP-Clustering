He said the state needs to create an environment that allows job creation, especially small businesses, to grow as a state and develop resources.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re unique as a state,\u201d Stubson said. \u201cWhen you only have 580,000 people it\u2019s different. The problems are different and the solutions to those problems are different.\u201d\n\nOne of the very important things for Stubson, he said, is fighting tendencies the Federal Government has that a one size fits all solution works for everyone, when it does not work for Wyoming.\n\nEnergy is a big topic for Wyoming and one of the many regulations the administration has come out with in recent years is a set of rules on hydraulic fracking, Stubson said. The rules though, look just like the rules already in Wyoming.\n\nStubson said it is important to address that the BLM enforcing these rules instead of the Wyoming oil and gas commission. He added that this new management does not benefit Wyoming.\n\nStubson said if the Cowboy State needs to recognize it already has the solution, as it is monitoring what is being pumped and who is doing the job so no additional systems and costs are neccessary.\n\nStubson has been working with the budget committee of Wyoming and for the last three months has been attempting to balance the budget.\n\n\u201cWe cut expenditures and dug into savings and we balanced the budget,\u201d Stubson said. \u201cThat obviously needs to happen at the federal level and those discussions don\u2019t happen.\u201d\n\nStubson said a balanced budget amendment needs to be enforced. He said Congress has shown it is unable to control its appetite for tax dollars. Wyoming is only about six states away from calling for a constitutional amendment for a balanced budget.\n\nStubson said a Wyoming representative must push for a balanced budget over the long term.\n\nAs far as healthcare goes, Stubson said changes need to be made.\n\n\u201cObamacare clearly does not work for the state of Wyoming,\u201d Stubson said. \u201cWe have more uninsured people now then we had when Obamacare passed.\u201d\n\nStubson said Obamacare, or the Affordable Care Act, is a good example of something that may work in a state with 17 million people, but does not work in a state like Wyoming with 580,000 people.\n\nWyoming residents pay the highest in healthcare and premiums, but balancing that across the country would dramatically benefit the people in Wyoming, which is not something seen in Obamacare, Stubson said.\n\nAs Stubson continues his campaign for U.S. Congress, his focus on Wyoming issues and what needs to be done federally to help the Cowboy State remains his priority.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "tim stubson, republican, wyoming house representatives, u.s. congress, malorie williamson,malorie williamson,republican,u.s. congress,wyoming house representatives", "generator": "Powered by Visual Composer - drag and drop page builder for WordPress.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Tim Stubson, Republican member of the Wyoming House of Representatives, is now on his campaign trail running for U.S. Congress."}, "article_summary": "Malorie Williamsonmwilli92@uwyo.eduTim Stubson, Republican member of the Wyoming House of Representatives, is now on his campaign trail running for U.S. Congress.\nIn Wyoming, Stubson said the big issue is economic growth.\n\u201cWe cut expenditures and dug into savings and we balanced the budget,\u201d Stubson said.\n\u201cWe\u2019re unique as a state,\u201d Stubson said.\n\u201cObamacare clearly does not work for the state of Wyoming,\u201d Stubson said."}
