He will form the nation\u2019s 62nd government since 1945 and the fourth since its descent into crisis in 2009.\n\nYou need a small stadium to seat Italy\u2019s population of postwar prime ministers. But this change of the guard is to be watched closely. Renzi could demonstrate \u201cwhat it takes,\u201d to get Italy out of trouble (to borrow from European Central Bank president Mario Draghi). But we are more likely to learn what is missing in all of Europe\u2019s repeated efforts to recover from its post\u20132008 blights.\n\nRelated: Italy\u2019s Renzi Faces a Daunting Task\n\nItalians think they have found someone big in Renzi, who has served as the mayor of Florence since 2009. In American politics 100 years ago, he would have been a \u201cnew broom.\u201d In Italy he is \u201cthe demolisher\u201d because he promises to blast open a famously encrusted political culture as if he were the lead in a special-effects film.\n\nRenzi is the one to take Italy decisively out of economic, social, and political peril and pain, Italians seem to have decided\u2014\u201cseem\u201d because Renzi has not run in a national election, just as the outgoing Enrico Letta did not (and just as Mario Monti, Letta\u2019s high-priest technocrat predecessor, did not).\n\nBut the room for doubt on this point is simply too large to ignore.\n\nLetta\u2019s resignation late last week and Renzi\u2019s lightning-fast rise reflected a quiet coup within the party they share, the left-ish Democrats. And the markets responded with an equanimity the chattering class found re-assuring: The FTSE Eurofirst 300 index gained 2.4 percent on the week.\n\nThis is in keeping with a mist of euphoria that now envelops investors. Lately they have been busy responding to better-than-expected GDP numbers in the eurozone for 2103. Italy grew (0.1 percent) for the first time since 2011. The Bank of England asserted that the UK economy would surge this year at a rate of 3.4 percent\u2014vaulting past South Korea, Taiwan, Brazil, and other proven performers.\n\nRelated: Italian PM Defies Call to Go after Showdown with Rival\n\nEqually, the sell-off in emerging markets\u2014$24 billion over the past eight months\u2014has flipped, persuading investment managers that it was all an overreaction; they can see bottom now, and it is time to jump in. Morgan Stanley\u2019s emerging markets index, the MSCI EM, has bounced 3.3 percent since February 4.\n\nIn a literal sense, this is a disconnect. Emerging markets investors fly partly on the assumption that political environments have nothing to do with economic prospects. It is wrong. See Ukraine, see Argentina\u2014see China, indeed.\n\nIt is the same in Italy and elsewhere among Europe\u2019s ailing economies. What we have watched for years are attempts to implement technocratic solutions to crises without democratic reference to the voters\u2019 preferences. Einstein\u2019s definition of insanity\u2014doing the same thing incessantly and expecting a new result\u2014applies.\n\nConsider the word \u201creform\u201d as commonly used in Europe and as Renzi\u2019s people use it now. Reforms leading to recovery are inherently political. What kind of reforms leading to what kind of recovery, benefiting whom and how? Europeans flinch from these questions and try to get by on the notion that technocratically conceived reforms lie beyond question. They do not. Technocrats can be smart; they are less often responsive political beings.\n\nRelated: Renzi Grabs Power in Italy Without Election\n\nThis is Renzi\u2019s gambit. It starts to look as if the political elite\u2014of which Renzi is a card-carrying member\u2014do not want to ask voters what they want because they are afraid of the answers.\n\nThis is understandable in light of Italy\u2019s last elected prime minister, Silvio Berlusconi\u2014enough said.\n\nBerlusconi\u2019s time-wasting irresponsibility does not justify fudging around the political process. It assigns Italian politicians the duty of developing imaginative solutions matching citizens\u2019 demands with sustainable policies. To take cover with the technocrats is to argue this is impossible\u2014a form of fatalism and a judgment on democracy.\n\nThe Letta\u2013Renzi duet was as neat as a traffic-light change. Giorgio Napolitano, the head of state, made clear as he prepared to ask Renzi to name a new government that calling elections was to be avoided at nearly any cost.\n\nThe rest of Europe assents. The prevailing line is that the ECB\u2019s bond-buying operations, which enabled Italy to avoid a full-dress bailout, have allowed Italians to carry on with their usual political fractiousness. \u201cI don\u2019t think Italy can afford that,\u201d Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the Dutch finance minister, said the other day. \u201cI don\u2019t think any country can afford that.\u201d\n\nRelated: Italy, U.S. Police Crack Big Mafia Drug Ring\n\nNeither Italians nor other Europeans in trouble can afford to quarantine reform strategists from the political process any longer, if they are to find reforms that stick.\n\nRenzi\u2019s tasks are formidable. He is advertised as advanced as Italy\u2019s Tony Blair, who swept aside \u201cold Labor\u201d adherents to traditional social-democratic thinking. Renzi\u2019s Democrats are the rump remains of the PCI, \u201cPeachy,\u201d the Italian Communist Party. This end of Renzi\u2019s job involves a change in political culture, as did Blair\u2019s, and we will see how far he gets.\n\nOther things are more pressing. With national debt of \u20ac2 trillion, $2.74 trillion, and unemployment at a record 12.7 percent (youth unemployment: 42 percent), how will he balance public-spending cuts, promised tax reductions, job creation, privatizations, and labor market reforms? He needs a parliamentary majority for these policies. Not surprisingly, there are already political delays in forming another fragile coalition to keep him in office.\n\nInvestors and Euro watchers now await Renzi\u2019s imminent choice for finance minister: Will he pick a political figure or a technocrat? His choice will signal whether he intends to govern\u2014let us be blunt\u2014democratically or otherwise.\n\nEasy enough to count Italy\u2019s parade of prime ministers and then count the hands needed to do so. But its political blocage is most of Europe\u2019s, too. No one articulates a persuasive vision of sustainable recovery because there are no ideas of a sustainable social contract\u2014not yet anyway.\n\nPerversely, a columnist can sometimes hope to be dead wrong. But I do not see Italy\u2019s young man in a hurry filling his own Florentine loafers, let alone anyone else\u2019s.\n\nTop Reads from from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Sometime this week or next, if all goes to plan,", "title": "Renzi, Italy\u2019s Man of the Moment, Has a Lot to Prove", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2014/02/17/Renzi-Italy-s-Man-Moment-Has-Lot-Prove", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/columns/Renzi.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2014/02/17/Renzi-Italy-s-Man-Moment-Has-Lot-Prove", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/columns/Renzi.jpg", "creator": "@psmith7600", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Sometime this week or next, if all goes to plan,", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Related: Italy\u2019s Renzi Faces a Daunting TaskItalians think they have found someone big in Renzi, who has served as the mayor of Florence since 2009.\nSometime this week or next, if all goes to plan, 39\u2013year\u2013old Matteo Renzi will become the youngest prime minister in Italian history.\nThis is understandable in light of Italy\u2019s last elected prime minister, Silvio Berlusconi\u2014enough said.\nBut I do not see Italy\u2019s young man in a hurry filling his own Florentine loafers, let alone anyone else\u2019s.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think Italy can afford that,\u201d Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the Dutch finance minister, said the other day."}
