Sean Patrick Maloney (D-N.Y.) and Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.) were among nine Democrats on Monday who voted for a Republican-led resolution that provided funds for the government for fiscal year 2014, but included a provision delaying the individual mandate and requiring members of Congress and their staffs to pay the full cost of insurance without the government subsidy.\n\nAdditionally, Maloney voted for another measure that includes the above policy items in addition to calling for a conference committee with the Senate, which would likely mean some give on health care reform.\n\nBoth Maloney and Sinema also joined Republicans on Sunday to vote for repeal of the tax on medical devices as part of Obamacare.\n\nEach House proposal was rejected by the Senate, which has insisted on a bill that only continues funding for the government, leading to the stalemate that caused the government shutdown on Tuesday.\n\nMichael Rogers, a D.C.-based LGBT rights advocate, said the vote means Sinema and Maloney are Democrats in name only.\n\n\u201cI am a progressive so I wish Sinema and Maloney were more concerned about the American people than with their reelection,\u201d Rogers said. \u201cWhen Democrats stand for Democratic principles we win. If these two people won as out LGBT people, surely they would not have been tossed out sticking with their caucus. It is sellouts like Sinema and Maloney who, as DINOs, are more than willing to cave in to the crazy demands of the right.\u201d\n\nMichaelangelo Signorile, a gay New York activist and radio host on SiriusXM, took to Twitter to express his indignation.\n\nGay ConservaDems took $$ from progressives, Sinema and Maloney, voted #shutdown. Make sure they meet fate of Christine Quinn @DenisDison \u2014 Mike Signorile (@MSignorile) October 1, 2013\n\nJohn Aravosis, who\u2019s gay and editor of AMERICAblog, also had harsh words for the two lawmakers, who ran as openly gay/bi candidates and took donations from the LGBT community.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s abominable,\u201d Aravosis said. \u201cNo Democrat, let alone a gay or bisexual one, should be working to undercut health care protections for Americans, let alone helping John Boehner do anything.\u201d\n\nThe other openly gay lawmakers in the U.S. House \u2014 Reps. Jared Polis (D-Colo.), David Cicciline (D-R.I.), Mark Takano (D-Calif.) and Mark Pocan (D-Wis.) \u2014 didn\u2019t join Maloney or Sinema in these votes.\n\nMaloney and Sinema voted against the most drastic proposal from House Republicans to attach a one-year delay of health care reform to the spending bill for fiscal year 2014.\n\nIn a statement, Maloney defended his vote for delaying the individual mandate by pointing to the administration.\n\n\u201cI strongly support the president\u2019s decision to give employers more time to comply with the law, and I believe that we should give families the same flexibility we\u2019re giving to our small businesses,\u201d Maloney said.\n\nMaloney also explained his support for eliminating health care subsidies for government employees by saying the playing field for public and private workers should be equal.\n\n\u201cFamilies and businesses in the Hudson Valley are not getting special subsidies from Obamacare and neither should members of Congress or the White House,\u201d Maloney said.\n\nIn a separate statement, Sinema defended her votes by saying they ensure individuals can sign up for health care plans without \u201cbeing punished\u201d for failing to purchase adequate healthcare coverage.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s now been proven that too many states are not ready to implement the marketplaces,\u201d Sinema said. \u201cIt\u2019s not fair to punish people who don\u2019t have the information they need to make informed decisions. Arizona\u2019s hard-working families need transparency and certainty about this healthcare law and its implementation. A one-year delay of the individual mandate will ensure that Arizonans get that certainty.\u201d\n\nSinema also said health care subsidies for government employees shouldn\u2019t happen with a government shutdown in effect.\n\n\u201cAdditionally, I supported tonight\u2019s amendment because members of Congress should not ask the government to pay for their healthcare while Americans at home suffer during government shutdown,\u201d Sinema said.\n\nNeither the office of House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) nor the Democratic National Committee responded to the Blade\u2019s request for comment on Sinema and Maloney joining House Republicans. Shin Inouye, a White House spokesperson, is on furlough and unable to respond to media requests.\n\nThe Gay & Lesbian Victory Fund, which endorsed the openly gay/bi candidates and called for donations from LGBT people for the candidates, didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment. The Human Rights Campaign also endorsed both candidates and didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nSinema and Maloney have been active on LGBT-specific issues since their election to Congress. They voted for an LGBT-inclusive version of the Violence Against Women Act reauthorization and signed a friend-of-the-court brief urging the U.S. Supreme Court to strike down the Defense of Marriage Act.\n\nDana Beyer, a Chevy Chase, Md.,-based transgender activist, said the LGBT community shouldn\u2019t judge Sinema and Maloney too harshly for their votes because \u201cthese late night political machinations are generally theater\u201d and don\u2019t say anything about the lawmakers\u2019 overall voting records.\n\n\u201cThis issue isn\u2019t about the LGBT community; it\u2019s about America,\u201d Beyer said. \u201cThey should be judged on a much broader set of criteria and values than this one vote, and I hope people take the context into account.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Two freshmen LGB members of Congress are incurring the wrath of gay activists for voting with House Republicans to delay certain portions of Obamacare in exchange for keeping the government in operation.", "generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Blade: Gay News, Politics, LGBT Rights", "description": "Two freshmen LGB members of Congress are incurring the wrath of gay activists for voting with House Republicans to delay certain portions of Obamacare in exchange for keeping the government in operation.", "title": "Gay, bi lawmakers criticized for joining GOP on Obamacare vote", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 404, "identifier": "http://www.washingtonblade.com/content/files/2013/10/Kyrsten_Sinema_courtesy_Sinema_campaign_and_Sean_Patrick_Maloney_c_Washington_Blade_by_Michael_Key_split_thumb.jpg", "height": 404}, "url": "http://www.washingtonblade.com/2013/10/02/sinema-maloney-obamacare/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Two freshmen LGB members of Congress are incurring the wrath of gay activists for voting with House Republicans to delay certain portions of Obamacare in exchange for keeping the government in operation.", "creator": "@chrisjohnson82", "image": "http://www.washingtonblade.com/content/files/2013/10/Kyrsten_Sinema_courtesy_Sinema_campaign_and_Sean_Patrick_Maloney_c_Washington_Blade_by_Michael_Key_split_thumb.jpg", "title": "Gay, bi lawmakers criticized for joining GOP on Obamacare vote", "site": "@WashBlade", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 13357499221}, "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/WashingtonBlade", "section": "News", "tag": "Sean Patrick Maloney", "published_time": "2013-10-02T11:22:15-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "news_keywords": "gay news, Washington Blade, Kyrsten Sinema, Sean Patrick Maloney, Obamacare"}, "article_summary": "Michael Rogers, a D.C.-based LGBT rights advocate, said the vote means Sinema and Maloney are Democrats in name only.\nBoth Maloney and Sinema also joined Republicans on Sunday to vote for repeal of the tax on medical devices as part of Obamacare.\nGay ConservaDems took $$ from progressives, Sinema and Maloney, voted #shutdown.\n\u201cFamilies and businesses in the Hudson Valley are not getting special subsidies from Obamacare and neither should members of Congress or the White House,\u201d Maloney said.\nA one-year delay of the individual mandate will ensure that Arizonans get that certainty.\u201dSinema also said health care subsidies for government employees shouldn\u2019t happen with a government shutdown in effect."}
