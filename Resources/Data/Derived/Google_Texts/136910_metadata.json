Long Medical Center....More and more poor and uninsured patients from the low-income neighborhoods of north Baton Rouge ended up at the Mid City hospital, which was the next-closest facility. Mid City hospital reported losses of $1 million a month as more and more patients who could not pay arrived. Losses jumped from $6 million to $8 million annually from 2009 to 2012, then up to $12.5 million in 2013, according to Baton Rouge General. Last year, the facility lost $23.8 million.\n\nThe nearest ER for residents who are currently served by Mid-City is now 30 minutes further away, and it's a certainty that people are going to die because of this. But what's the real story behind this closure? Shouldn't the expansion of Medicaid be offsetting the increased losses on uninsured patients?\n\nYou bet it should. And it would, if Bobby Jindal were willing to accept Obamacare's offer of virtually free Medicaid expansion. But he's not, and that means Baton Rouge is losing one of its central emergency rooms and more people will die who otherwise could have been saved. That's some nice work, Bobby.
