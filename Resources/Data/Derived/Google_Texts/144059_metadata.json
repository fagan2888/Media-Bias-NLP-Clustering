The renaming is a symbolic pushback against the Soviet narrative that countries within the USSR. banded together for the defense of a common fatherland after the Nazi invasion in June 1941.\n\nMoscow was swift to push back against the moves.\n\n\u201cThe only thing that can be regretted is that such decisions and statements made in the weeks preceding the Victory Day anniversary will make many veterans meet the holiday with tears in their eyes. I mean the veterans of the Great Patriotic War,\u201d Russian Presidential Press Secretary Dmitry Peskov told journalists Thursday, according to the Russian news agency TASS.\n\nMany Ukrainians also point to historical grievances like the Ukrainian famine of 1932 to 1933, in which as many as 7 million Ukrainians starved to death as a result of Stalin\u2019s forced collective farming program, as reasons why Soviet legacies should be scrubbed.\n\nRussian officials, however, accuse Ukrainian lawmakers of distorting history. On Wednesday a top Russian diplomat responded to a Ukrainian lawmaker who referred to Russia as an \u201caggressor nation\u201d in World War II.\n\n\u201cThey blatantly falsify history, tarnish the history of the war, casting a shadow over the Great Victory of the Soviet people, which made a decisive contribution to the fight against Nazism,\u201d Russian Foreign Ministry Commissioner for Human Rights, Democracy and the Rule of Law Konstantin Dolgov said, according to TASS.\n\nThe recent barbs between Kyiv and Moscow also highlight how World War II remains front and center in the current Ukraine conflict. Nearly 70 years later, the war\u2019s ideological fault lines drive the propaganda fired in both directions.\n\nRussian and separatist propaganda often paint the post-revolution government in Kyiv as neo-Nazi or neo-fascist.\n\n\u201cNone of these neo-Nazis, followers of Bandera and other ultranationalists has been punished and called to account,\u201d Dolgov said Wednesday, according to TASS. \u201c[A]ll this neo-Nazi mayhem has been taking place under the connivance and even support of the Ukrainian authorities and tacit non-resistance, at the very least, and even encouragement from certain political circles in the West.\u201d\n\nWhile in Kyiv, sidewalk vendors sell paintings and rolls of toilet paper with the likeness of Russian President Vladimir Putin sporting a close-trimmed Hitler moustache. Stickers of Russian flags adorned with a swastika are a common sight in Kyiv\u2019s Independence Square (the Maidan).\n\nAnd Western pundits and politicians often compare Putin\u2019s land grabs in former Soviet states with Hitler\u2019s annexation of the Sudetenland prior to World War II.\n\nThe war\u2019s legacy is also evident on the battlefield. Many pro-Ukraine civilian volunteer battalions have resurrected symbols and flags from Ukrainian partisan groups that fought both Nazi and Soviet troops in the war.\n\nThe debate over the war also reveals the lasting scars of a conflict that killed about 26 million in the Soviet Union. In another World War II-related event Wednesday, Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko met with Polish President Bronislaw Komorowski at an event in Warsaw to remember the victims of totalitarianism.\n\n\u201cGod forbid us from seeing a new Babyn Yar, Bykivnia, Katyn, and a new Holocaust or Holodomor,\u201d Poroshenko said, referencing both Nazi and Soviet atrocities before and during the war, according to Ukrainian media.\n\n\u201cAnschluss, annexation, occupation\u2014our eastern neighbor has just refreshed these notions in our memory,\u201d he added.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Ukrainian parliament approved a law renaming the Great Patriotic War as the Second World War, underscoring a move to ditch its Soviet past.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The Ukrainian parliament approved a law renaming the Great Patriotic War as the Second World War, underscoring a move to ditch its Soviet past.", "title": "Ukraine Moves to Ditch its Soviet Past", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/SovietsFeature.png", "updated_time": "2015-04-10T22:07:56+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1DsUyuj"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The Ukrainian parliament approved a law renaming the Great Patriotic War as the Second World War, underscoring a move to ditch its Soviet past.", "title": "Ukraine Moves to Ditch its Soviet Past", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/SovietsFeature.png"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Featured Topics", "tag": "europe", "published_time": "2015-04-10T15:38:47+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-04-10T22:07:56+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Ukraine, cease-fire, Russia, Putin, NATO, Lavrov, U.S. Army, Victory Day, May 9, World War II, Great Patriotic War"}, "article_summary": "KYIV, Ukraine\u2014The Ukrainian parliament approved a law Thursday renaming the Great Patriotic War as the Second World War, underscoring a sweeping move by the post-revolutionary government here to ditch its Soviet past.\nThe recent barbs between Kyiv and Moscow also highlight how World War II remains front and center in the current Ukraine conflict.\nAnd Western pundits and politicians often compare Putin\u2019s land grabs in former Soviet states with Hitler\u2019s annexation of the Sudetenland prior to World War II.\nI mean the veterans of the Great Patriotic War,\u201d Russian Presidential Press Secretary Dmitry Peskov told journalists Thursday, according to the Russian news agency TASS.\nAbandoning Ukraine\u2019s Soviet legacy has upended decades-old ways of thinking for Ukrainian citizens who grew up in the USSR."}
