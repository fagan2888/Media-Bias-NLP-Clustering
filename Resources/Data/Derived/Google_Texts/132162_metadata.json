Simitian admitted to authorities that from roughly February 2010 through June 2014, with the help of co-conspirators, illegal cash kickbacks were paid to \"patient recruiters\" for bringing Medicare beneficiaries to his clinics. Simitian also admitted that with the help of his co-conspirators, he then billed Medicare for lab tests and other services that were either not medically necessary or were never actually performed. Authorities say fraudulent documents were created and provided as support for those claims.\n\nA total of $4,526,791 in fake claims were submitted to Medicare. Medicare paid $1,668,559 on those claims, which matches the amount Simitian has been ordered to pay in restitution.\n\nThe case was investigated by the FBI and Health and Human Services Office of the Inspector General, and was brought as part of the Medicare Fraud Strike Force.
