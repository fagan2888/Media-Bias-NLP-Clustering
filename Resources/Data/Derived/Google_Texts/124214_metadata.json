My generation of Millennials is embracing entrepreneurial oil jobs to keep America\u2019s lights on.\n\nOn June 2, the Obama administration proposed new carbon regulations calling for a 30 percent reduction in carbon emissions by 2030. Why 2030? Who knows! It\u2019s an arbitrary date, not a number based on sound science.\n\nCoal currently supplies 39 percent of America\u2019s electricity. TIME Magazine reports that Obama\u2019s proposal will promote \u201cfuel switching\u201d from coal to so-called clean forms of energy such as solar. Fuel switching is the politically correct term for putting Americans out of work and the power grid in jeopardy. There are consequences to this knee-jerk switch to government-subsidized \u201cgreen\u201d energy.\n\nMillennials understand these consequences. Which is why a Pew report issued this spring found that Millennials are \u201csomewhat less likely than older adults to describe themselves as environmentalists\u2014just 32% say this describes them very well\u2026\u201d Millennials care about the environment. But, since science tells us that humans are not responsible for detrimental warming and over 15% of us are unemployed\u2014our priority is jobs.\n\nThe Shale Boomers\n\nOur parents are Baby Boomers. Call us the Shale Boomers.\n\n20-something and 30-something Millennials are jumping into the oil industry. Bloomberg Businessweek reports that \u201cAfter years of failing to attract and retain young talent, the industry is suddenly brimming with upstart millennials....\u201d and that \u201coil and gas veterans call it \u2018the great crew change.\u2019\u201d\n\nYoung whippersnappers are taking advantage of the shale boom to start their own businesses, and are doing well. Bloomberg reports that there has been a 60 percent increase in the Young Professionals in Energy\u2019s Dallas chapter since 2009. That means there are now 4,000 young professionals in the Dallas chapter\u2014and many are staking out careers in oil.\n\nMillennials embrace oil and fracking because we understand that wind and solar is not necessarily \u201cenvironmentally friendly.\u201d That is, unless you call the birds killed by windmills and the desert land consumed with thousands of reflecting mirrors earth-friendly. Solar panels are also dependent on rare earths, which are dominantly mined by the world\u2019s Polluter-in-Chief, China.\n\nSecond, we understand that the technology is not there yet. Both wind and solar provide intermittent energy and cannot replace the steady, reliable energy that we get from coal and natural gas. Tech-dependent Millennials are not very interested in living through a blackout.\n\nThird, we understand that since 2007, there has been a net increase of only 0.3% jobs for young people between the ages of 22 and 34.\n\nWhere are all those jobs\u2014especially the permanent green jobs that President Obama promised us? I\u2019ve looked high. I\u2019ve looked low. I\u2019ve seen the Treasury Inspector General\u2019s report indicating that the federal government handed out bonuses to IRS employees who did not pay their taxes. But my young friends are still living with their parents. And our parents are just as frustrated as we are! After all, they thought they could enjoy retirement instead of delaying retirement while Lois Lerner enjoys her paid vacation.\n\nExperts estimate that Obama\u2019s carbon regulations proposal will cull 250,000 jobs as 165 coal-fired plants have either shuttered or are set to shutter.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s a dirty little secret: people are tired of [President Obama\u2019s] speeches. People want jobs,\u201d Rush Limbaugh said on his talk show on November 11, 2009. Rush made that statement seven days after Obama was elected for the first time. If we were tired then, we\u2019re exhausted now. \u201cDead exhausted,\u201d as Hillary Clinton might moan.\n\nThere is hope and solutions, as I explain in my new book, \u201cLet Me Be Clear,\u201d that Random House is publishing on June 24. There are ways to create jobs, become entrepreneurs and take back our American Dreams. But, we must strike while the iron is hot and implement these solutions now\u2014before the midterms and 2016 presidential elections.\n\nOtherwise, we\u2019ll add four more years of Hillary to a country that, at $17.5 trillion in the hole, is already \u201cdead broke.\u201d Let\u2019s take action.", "article_metadata": {"description": "There\u2019s hope for the future.
