Nothing says “Happy Thanksgiving” like battling your dastardly Republican relatives at the dinner table.

At least that’s what the Democratic National Committee must have been thinking when they released a website full of talking points to thwart your conservative thinking family members during the holiday dinner.

“The holiday season is filled with food, traveling, and lively discussions with Republican relatives about politics sometimes laced with statements that are just not true,” the DNC wrote on its website YourRepublicanUncle.com. “Here are the most common myths spouted by your family members who spend too much time listening to Rush Limbaugh and the perfect response to each of them.”

The website provides flash cards for liberals to deal with relatives who support Donald Trump, Jeb Bush, Marco Rubio, John Kasich and Ted Cruz as well as those who oppose Obamacare, believe climate change is not man made, are against allowing Syrian refugees into America and more.

This is not the first year Democrats have done something like this in what has become sort of an idiotic tradition of the DNC.

In 2013 Organizing For America, a group run by the DNC, released an Obamacare commercial for Thanksgiving.

Last year DNC Chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz promoted the same website last year and warned of Republican “Uncle Fred.”

Man do they know how to celebrate the season or what?
