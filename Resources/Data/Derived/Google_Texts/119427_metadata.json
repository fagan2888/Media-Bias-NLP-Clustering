And that will be bad for everybody. We have to tackle our debt crisis. We have to tackle the drivers of our debt. And I think, I hope, that whoever our standard bearer's going to be will acknowledge that.\u201d\n\nIs it true that Medicare is facing a crisis, and that it is one of the \u201cdrivers of our debt\u201d? How do the Republican presidential candidates, and Ryan himself, plan to address this so-called debt crisis?\n\nRelated: As National Debt Hits $19 Trillion, a Spending Showdown Looms in Congress\n\nFirst, on Medicare\u2019s finances, according to the 2015 report from Medicare\u2019s trustees, the fund can pay full benefits until 2030. At that point, the trust fund is projected for exhaustion, but that should not be confused with going bankrupt. Even then, the program will still be able to pay for 86 percent of costs, and modest tweaks to the program or additional healthcare cost savings over and above those in Obamacare \u2013 the ACA has helped to reduce Medicare\u2019s projected 75-year funding gap from 3.88 percent of payroll taxes to .68 percent \u2013 could eliminate the projected shortfall in the trust fund.\n\nTrustee reports have been telling us the Medicare trust fund will soon be insolvent for decades, but presidents and Congress have always taken steps to ensure this didn\u2019t happen. What we need is a functional Congress with honest leaders rather than scare tactics designed to support an ideological goal of lower taxes for the wealthy and severe cutbacks in social insurance programs.\n\nSecond, Republicans are worried about a \u201cdebt crisis.\u201d Seriously? Paul Ryan\u2019s budget proposals are nothing more than disguised upward redistribution of income sold as addressing the budget deficit. The proposals \u2013 like those of Republicans more generally \u2013 involve massive cuts to social programs ordinary Americans rely upon combined with huge tax cuts for the wealthy that blow huge holes in projected budget deficits.\n\nDonald Trump\u2019s tax plan will result in a fall in revenue of 9.5 trillion dollars over the next ten years, yet somehow he will fulfill his promise to protect Social Security and Medicare and balance the budget? When push comes to shove (or worse \u2013 this is Trump after all), who do you think he will protect, social insurance programs the working class relies upon for economic security or his own and his party\u2019s wealthy interests? Ted Cruz has proposed an 8.6 trillion dollar tax cut. How, exactly, will that be financed without large cuts to social insurance programs or huge increases in the budget deficit?\n\nRelated: Cruz\u2019s Economic Plan Would Add Trillions to the Debt\n\nRepublicans have fooled people into thinking budget deficits can be reduced substantially by eliminating waste and fraud in government, cutting foreign aid, or that it is the fault of lazy, undeserving \u201cothers\u201d who sponge off of government programs. As James Surowiecki notes:\n\n\u201cForty-nine per cent of those surveyed in a 2013 Fox News poll agreed that cutting \u2018waste and fraud\u2019 could eliminate the national debt. In addition, voters have a poor sense of how government money is spent. When Trump says that he wants to close the Department of Education and the E.P.A., it might sound like a big saving. Yet their combined budgets amount to a small fraction of his proposed tax cut. Likewise with foreign aid: polls show that Americans think as much as a quarter of the federal budget goes to other countries, when it\u2019s actually less than one per cent of total spending.\u201d\n\nIn addition, the notion that a large proportion of working class tax dollars goes to support the \u201cundeserving poor\u201d has been pushed by Republicans for decades, but this is yet another deception designed to support the ideological agenda of the wealthy interests that have been in control of the Republican Party. The reality is that most of this spending \u2013 around 98 percent according to an analysis by the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities \u2013 goes to working households and people with clear, demonstrable needs.\n\nRelated: Debating the Deficit: 'Mr. Trump Your Numbers Don\u2019t Add Up!'\n\nI am very happy that the Republican con is starting to come to light. Members of the working class who support Trump are beginning to see that the elites in the Republican Party do not have their best interests at heart. I am not pleased at all, however, that people are still being led to believe that there are simple answers to budget problems that do not require raising taxes, or, alternatively, reducing their hard-earned benefits from programs such as Social Security or Medicare.\n\nWhen working class Republican voters are asked if they support reducing the budget, they generally echo what they have been told by the elites and say yes \u2013 of course that\u2019s a good idea. But when they are asked if they favor cuts to programs they benefit from, Social Security for example, the answer is a resounding no.\n\nWhat the Republican elites fear most of all is that the working class voters who have supported them in the past will come to realize that the solution is not the false promise of prosperity for all from tax cuts for wealthy \u201cjob creators,\u201d or cuts to the programs the working class depends upon, but rather tax increases on those who have done so well within our economic system. The Republican elites are right to be afraid.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "In a recent interview with CNBC, House speaker Paul Ryan", "title": "GOP Candidates Would Sacrifice the Social Safety Net for Tax Cuts", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2016/03/22/GOP-Candidates-Would-Sacrifice-Social-Safety-Net-Tax-Cuts", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/10252013_GOP_Elephant_Drinking.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2016/03/22/GOP-Candidates-Would-Sacrifice-Social-Safety-Net-Tax-Cuts", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/10252013_GOP_Elephant_Drinking.jpg", "creator": "@MarkThoma", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "In a recent interview with CNBC, House speaker Paul Ryan", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd33fb\"", "article_summary": "How, exactly, will that be financed without large cuts to social insurance programs or huge increases in the budget deficit?\nThe proposals \u2013 like those of Republicans more generally \u2013 involve massive cuts to social programs ordinary Americans rely upon combined with huge tax cuts for the wealthy that blow huge holes in projected budget deficits.\nBut when they are asked if they favor cuts to programs they benefit from, Social Security for example, the answer is a resounding no.\nHow do the Republican presidential candidates, and Ryan himself, plan to address this so-called debt crisis?\nMembers of the working class who support Trump are beginning to see that the elites in the Republican Party do not have their best interests at heart."}
