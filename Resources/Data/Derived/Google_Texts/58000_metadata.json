On Thursday he kicked off a race for president of the United States, the Iron Man triathlon of politics. He has run 20 races already, as many as Barack Obama and Bill and Hillary Clinton combined. He says this one, like all the rest, will be a grassroots movement financed by small-donor giving. All politicians say that, but in a career spanning 43 years, Sanders has shown he means it. It\u2019s just one of the reasons why people say he can\u2019t win.\n\nIt isn\u2019t the only one, as Washington handicappers hasten to explain. Another is his allegedly unsociable personality. It\u2019s true that he isn\u2019t much of a networker; you won\u2019t see many \u201cFriend of Bernie\u201d pins. He\u2019ll do well with small groups; one on one, not so much. He doesn\u2019t even have quiet charisma. He relies more on logic than charm \u2014 and everyone he\u2019s met says that\u2019s the right call.\n\nMost other analysis is standard-issue political punditry. Noting that \u201cthere have been no top-flight hires,\u201d Politico quotes a \u201clabor strategist\u201d who says Sanders \u201cdoesn\u2019t have a shot\u201d at union endorsements. Bloomberg says \u201chis aversion to big-dollar fundraising raises questions about whether he can collect cash at the level needed to compete with Clinton.\u201d No doubt working with inside sources, the New York Times\u2019 Nate Cohn confides that Sanders \u201cwill most likely champion the liberal cause\u201d and then explains why that can\u2019t possibly work: \u201cThe left wing of the Democratic Party just isn\u2019t big enough to support a challenge to the left of a mainstream liberal Democrat like Mrs. Clinton.\u201d\n\nCohn backs up his thesis with a 2014 Pew poll that says lots of Democrats aren\u2019t really liberals. How 2008 turned out the way it did, he doesn\u2019t say.\n\nClinton loyalists welcome Sanders\u2019 entry because they know she needs a contest, or at least a tune-up. Of course, to get the full benefit she\u2019d have to agree to debate, something she has yet to say she\u2019ll do. That Sanders is six years older than Clinton must feel like a bit of great good luck to them. Some call him a perfect foil; a lesser threat than Warren, yet enough of one to provide progressives with some catharsis while bestowing Clinton with the legitimacy that comes only from competition.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to win,\u201d Bernie told ABC\u2019s Jon Karl on Thursday, but everyone assumes he won\u2019t. That assumption marginalized him from the moment he got in the race. On his big day, \u201cCBS This Morning\u201d gave him 34 seconds of coverage. On the Times\u2019 web page, a 662-word news story spent a few afternoon hours beneath a report of the American Psychological Association\u2019s condoning of Bush-era torture tactics before being relegated to a link headlined \u201cBernie Sanders to Run for President, Opposing Clinton.\u201d A 900-word piece on Hillary\u2019s recent departure from Bill\u2019s old crime agenda helped push it off the page.\n\nIt won\u2019t get any easier for Sanders. I hate horse race coverage as much as anyone, but there\u2019s no sense denying such long odds. Liberals who fretted that Hillary might escape a challenge now fret that a poor showing by Bernie may weaken their case. You\u2019d think by now they\u2019d have tired of tactical thinking, but no. There are better ways to think about 2016. You could, for example, think like an organizer. If you haven\u2019t done it in a while, you needn\u2019t worry. It\u2019s like riding a bicycle.\n\nThe first thing to recall is that there are many ways to be a \u201cserious\u201d candidate. Of Bernie Sanders\u2019 first 20 races, many were just as hard as this one. Some were truly impossible; in his first four he finished in single digits. Yet each campaign helped build a movement that would eventually transform Vermont into the enlightened place it is today. You can\u2019t get more serious than that.\n\nWouldn\u2019t it be great to put America on a path like the one Vermont took? It could happen, but only if this latest Sanders campaign is as fearless and selfless as the first \u2014 and only if progressives see the opportunity and honor it with wise choices. The opportunity is the chance to define an agenda, build a movement and engage the nation in a real debate. A few preliminary thoughts on the choices:\n\n1. Sanders promises to mount a strong grass-roots campaign. In building it, he can\u2019t expect much help from the progressive establishment. Politico\u2019s \u2018labor strategist\u2019 is right. Faced with a choice between the union-baiting Wall Street water carrier Rahm Emanuel and his well-qualified, progressive challenger Chuy Garcia, 90 percent of Chicago labor unions stuck with Rahm. Hillary should do at least as well.\n\nSanders must look beyond the old Washington-centric left long since colonized by Democrats to a new left yet in its chrysalis stage. It\u2019s the left of progressive unions trying out new forms of organizing and governance; of mass organizations like 350.org and Moveon.org who still cultivate grassroots democracy; of a Working Families Party battling the old Democrat hierarchy from within; of millions of low-wage earners, the underemployed and the self-employed; of pioneers working to strengthen the commons and experimenting with more democratic forms of ownership and production. The way to draw them in is to distill an agenda that speaks to their needs.\n\nSanders must promise to do what he did in Vermont; leave a legacy to build on. The 2008 Obama campaign spawned the largest grassroots political movement in American history. Today it\u2019s a zombie movement without even a pretense of democratic governance. Sanders must not turn his grassroots campaign into yet another proprietary mailing list run by donors and consultants. When it\u2019s over, it should belong to all the people who built it. Progressives should demand the same of Clinton and any other Democrat. No one who refuses should get a nickel.\n\n2. Sanders vows to finance his grassroots campaign with small donations. It\u2019s a promise he must honor. Progressive Democrats tolerate their party\u2019s corruption because they believe its leaders must make awful compromises to get the money they need to win. But their compromises destroy their credibility and erode their support. The power of ideas is greater than the power of money. Given the odds, Sanders doesn\u2019t have to win the race to prove the point. He just has to win the debate.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Stop thinking about winners, losers and the dumb horse race.
