The Beaufort Police Dept. is investigating after a man died from an apparent gunshot wound in the 1400 block of Greene Street.

Officers arrived on the scene at around 9:15 p.m. on Thursday and discovered the 38-year-old man dead. Officers interviewed several witnesses in the area and continue to follow up on any leads.

This is one of at least three murders here in the county in just two months, and the upswing in violence has local groups taking action.

"Once again, why is this still happening, not another victim just the usual reaction,” said Stephanie Finn, Beaufort Strong.

"When I saw my phone ringing that late at night, I knew it wasn't 12, so I knew it wasn't Christmas. When I heard the news I just thought wow another family has to deal with this before Christmas,” said Charles Mitchell, Concerned Citizens of Jasper County.

The Beaufort Strong movement started after a prominent community figure was killed while breaking up a fight, and now the group says they'll stop at nothing to stop the violence.

"It’s time we start meeting with our local administrators, our police, just anybody who is in the community. It's time for us to hold a town meeting and start working on Beaufort County as a whole,” said Finn.

"Come together with our state representatives to see if we can work to increase the penalties for those individuals with guns or using those weapons in a violent crime. If we can increase those penalties hopefully that will be a deterrent for those individuals who want to use a gun and kill someone. We have to take the fear out of the people and put the fear back in the criminals,” said Mitchell.

WTOC spoke with one man who lives on Greene Street, who didn't want to be identified, but he says all he heard was a single shot and then there was a large police presence.

Anyone with information is asked to contact Inv. Raley at 322.7914 or the 24 hour dispatch line at 524.2777.
