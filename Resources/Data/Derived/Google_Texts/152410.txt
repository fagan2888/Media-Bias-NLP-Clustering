COLORADO SPRINGS — The body of a woman discovered Saturday morning in Stratton Open Space is believed to be that of Ksenia Quiros, the mother of an Air Force Academy cadet who died this month.

Hikers discovered the body Saturday morning in the area where searchers had been looking for her since Wednesday night.

Officials said the El Paso County coroner must confirm her identity and the cause of death.

“Thank you all for your support. Unfortunately, Ksenia’s body was found earlier today,” her husband, Jose, said in a statement posted on Facebook. “We ask that we be provided some privacy at this time. We can only handle so much tragedy at a time. Thank you all again, we are overwhelmed with the support.”

The statement was posted by Jose Quiros’ sister, Ana Lorena Quiros, who also thanked all the searchers, friends, family and strangers who had offered support.

The body was found in a steep, rugged area west of Gold Camp Reservoir, and was not near a trail. The closest trail system was 1,000 to 2,000 yards away, officials said.

It was a “very sad outcome for us,” said a spokesman for the Colorado Springs Fire Department, which had been searching for Quiros since Wednesday night.

“We are confident in saying all the searches can stop,” officials said at a news conference.

The discovery came a few hours after volunteer searchers set out from Broadmoor Elementary School to search for Quiros.

Quiros, had been missing since Wednesday.

Her son, Alexandre Quiros, died in his Air Force Academy dorm room April 2. Few details of his death have been released, but academy officials have said there is no criminal investigation.
