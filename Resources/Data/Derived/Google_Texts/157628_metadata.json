Ralph Alvarado is looking into whether Kentucky can start selling its successful health insurance exchange program \u2014 Kynect \u2014 to other states.\n\nAlvarado wants to offer the technology and expertise behind Kynect to other states for a fee. States currently have the option of creating their own insurance marketplace or using the federal government\u2019s under the Affordable Care Act. More than 30 states currently rely on the federal exchange.\n\nAlvarado, a Republican physician who represents Winchester, said profits from his plan could help pay for the future costs of expanded Medicaid in Kentucky, which are estimated at $1.1 billion over the next six years.\n\n\u201cIt will provide our neighbors who want state exchanges a service that they want, and it would give our taxpayers a break from having to foot that bill in the future,\u201d he said.\n\nUnder Alvarado\u2019s proposal, first reported by the Lexington Herald-Leader, Kentucky would send software and hardware to other states and run the online health insurance marketplace for them.\n\n\u201cMy thought was you could convert Kentucky into a state health exchange hub for the country,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are stipulations within the ACA that allow for regional exchanges to take place.\u201d\n\nSabrina Corlette with Georgetown University\u2019s Health Policy Institute said Alvarado is correct about the law. And his plan wouldn\u2019t be unprecedented: Connecticut successfully sold its exchange to Maryland.\n\n\u201cThere is a template out there for states that have a successful platform to market that, and potentially sell it and generate revenue,\u201d Corlette said.\n\nBut Corlette said the bigger issue is convincing states with a federally run exchange to buy Kentucky\u2019s services.\n\n\u201cFor now, they seem pretty content with the status quo,\u201d she said. \u201cNot a lot of states are actually very interested in building their own state exchange at this point.\u201d\n\nCorlette said the federally run exchange is operating fairly well and doesn\u2019t require states to put \u201cskin in the game.\u201d It isn\u2019t clear whether there would be a cost difference to policyholders if states adopted their own exchanges.\n\nNor is it certain the legislature would even consider the idea. Republican state Senate President Robert Stivers, an opponent of the ACA, told the Herald-Leader he hasn\u2019t reviewed Alvarado\u2019s proposal. Meanwhile, state Health and Family Services Secretary Audrey Haynes told the newspaper that the concept is worthy of merit, but she said the continued political disputes over Kynect could tarnish its image if the state were trying to market it elsewhere.\n\nMore than 500,000 Kentuckians have signed up for health insurance through Kynect since it came online in 2014. The vast majority of those are receiving coverage through expanded Medicaid.\n\nAlvarado, who said he is not a fan of the federal health law, told WFPL his plan is in the \u201cdiscovery phase.\u201d He said he would meet with federal health officials to assess its feasibility.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Republican state Sen.
