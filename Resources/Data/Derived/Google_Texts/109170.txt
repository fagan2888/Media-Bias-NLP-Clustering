Well, I managed to make it through the morning. In case you're curious about what's going on with me, I'm having difficulty breathing. It came on rather suddenly a couple of weeks ago, and since then I've undergone loads of tests. The results are simple: my heart is fine, my lungs are fine, my O2 saturation is fine, and my ribs aren't cracked. A CT scan showed no inflammation or blood clots. A pulmonary specialist prescribed an inhaler just to see if it would work—I'm guessing it's an extract of pure unobtanium considering how much it cost—and it might be helping a little bit. But probably not. Sometimes I'm OK, other times I feel like I just ran a marathon. Yesterday I laid on the couch and watched movies all day. Today I'm better, but hardly breathing easily.

It's frustrating as hell. Can I blame Obamacare? In any case, the only catblogging pictures I have are a few I took earlier this week when I was feeling better. So here you go, Domino sunning herself in the front yard on Tuesday. Enjoy.
