In his second book, \u201cOne Nation: What We Can Do To Save America\u2019s Future,\u201d Carson reveals just how close he came to the school-to-prison pipeline.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to believe now, but Carson had an anger problem as an adolescent. In one angry moment, he struck out and plunged a knife into the abdomen of another teen.\n\nThe knife struck a belt buckle and did no damage, but Carson writes he shocked himself.\n\nIf such an incident had happened in Jacksonville, Carson could have been thrown into adult court and had a police record follow him for the rest of his life.\n\nHowever, no one was hurt. Carson was free to take his academic and intellectual skills to the top.\n\nCarson gives most of the credit to his mother, who apparently could not read well herself. She forced her children to read a book a week and write a book report for her. Carson discovered he was good at school and enjoyed that success.\n\nCarson spends much space in his new book criticizing political correctness while praising the ability to compromise. He proposes something he calls \u201ccordial disagreement.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs individuals, we can educate ourselves and our children, cultivate the art of compromise, pray for wisdom and hold our representatives accountable,\u201d he writes.\n\nHowever, Carson also sees a role for government. He supports affordable child care to allow single mothers to further their schooling.\n\n\u201cMany on the right exhibit bigotry by assuming that those who believe in the sacredness of big government have socialistic tendencies,\u201d he writes.\n\n\u201cThis is of course not true and many people who have grown up with significant government assistance simply don\u2019t know any other way of life and are patriotic American citizens.\u201d\n\nA ROLE FOR GOVERNMENT\n\nCarson believes in fair taxation along the lines of tithing, the biblical idea of contributing 10 percent.\n\nRegarding the Second Amendment, Carson proposes ways to ensure safety for the largest number of people while preserving the constitutional right.\n\nThe key to successful politics as in most things in life is timing. When do you step forward? When do you step back? When does compromise look like giving up? Which principles can never be compromised?\n\nAnother example of compromise was the welfare reform of the 1990s when President Bill Clinton and House Speaker Newt Gingrich worked together.\n\n\u201cThese kinds of cooperative efforts actually led to a budgetary surplus for the first time in many years,\u201d Carson wrote.\n\nOn taxes, Carson supports lowering rates and eliminating loopholes, which already has bipartisan support but can\u2019t seem to get passed in Congress.\n\nHe supports the proposals of the Simpson-Bowles commission as \u201ca reasoned approach to getting our deficit under control and growing the economy.\u201d However, the Simpson-Bowles recommendations fell victim to the toxic Potomac partisanship; there was something for just about everyone to oppose in its mix of revenue increases and benefit cuts.\n\nOn same-sex marriage, Carson proposes full civil unions for any two consenting adults without altering the traditional definition of marriage. That idea was struck down in California, however, where courts ruled that California\u2019s expansive civil union law was not enough.\n\nIn his new book, Carson outlines a radical way to replace Obamacare by transferring government funding of health insurance to health savings accounts that build from birth. The plan clearly needs to be fleshed out.\n\nCARSON\u2019S FUTURE\n\nA great life story, however, doesn\u2019t necessarily translate into political acumen or political success.\n\nFrankly, Carson is a medical specialist but a political novice. People who overlook this fact have only the executive inexperience of our president to consider.\n\nCarson looks most inexperienced when he starts writing about public policy matters. In his first book, he outlined a way to socialize the education of physicians. Government would fund their education. That\u2019s an interesting idea for the ivory tower but not likely to go anywhere politically.\n\nThe best training for a president generally is in one of America\u2019s statehouses as governor.\n\nThe executive lessons learned in a statehouse translate better to the White House than being in the Senate or even in private industry. If Carson doesn\u2019t want to run for governor, he could run for Senate.\n\nHe also would seem to be an ideal vice presidential candidate on a Republican ticket.\n\nOr Carson could take the route of Colin Powell and get involved in the nonprofit world and continue his speaking tour as a national role model.\n\nAmericans should never tire of Carson\u2019s all-American success story based on hard work and education.\n\nIt helps to have a little luck along the way, but mostly Carson made his own luck.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Ben Carson has lived a remarkable life, emerging from the mean streets of Detroit to become a nationally known pediatric neurologist at Johns Hopkins.Now he is transforming his life story into a potential run for the presidency.
