Bob Miller as her toughest campaign. She was criticized on a personal level, she said, for everything from wearing skirts critics said were too short to crying at a debate.\n\nIn modern politics, a contact sport, male candidates don\u2019t pull punches, especially in highly competitive races against female candidates. That\u2019s one reason Democratic congressional candidate Erin Bilbray caused some head-scratching when she complained recently that Rep. Joe Heck, R-Nev., wasn\u2019t acting \u201cgentle\u00admanly\u201d by calling her a \u201cliberal activist, fundraiser and spin doctor\u201d on the day she announced she would challenge him.\n\nBilbray said such negative talk and campaign attacks discourage women from running. But Jones and other female candidates say women should expect harsh treatment.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re much tougher on women than they are on men,\u201d Jones said of electoral opponents and the media. \u201cIf you want to be a player, you can\u2019t expect ladylike treatment.\u201d\n\nVUCANOVICH FOUGHT BACK\n\nPatty Cafferata, who is Vucanovich\u2019s daughter and the first female to win a state office in Nevada \u2014 treasurer in 1982 \u2014 said she saw her tough-as-nails mother compete in some of the nastiest campaigns Nevada has seen.\n\n\u201cIt isn\u2019t bean bag, as somebody said,\u201d Cafferata said, laughing. \u201cIf you want equality and you get treated equally, then what\u2019s the beef? I think if you\u2019re going to run with the big boys you have to be ready to face attacks.\u201d\n\nWorse than getting attacked is being ignored, added Cafferata. She said that\u2019s what Richard Bryan did when she lost the governor\u2019s race to the Democrat in 1986. He didn\u2019t see her as a serious electoral threat. She ended up getting only 25 percent of the vote, proving him right.\n\nVucanovich, who passed away this summer, nearly always faced highly competitive races and learned to turn attacks back on her opponents, giving as good as she got.\n\nAfter then-Reno Mayor Pete Sferrazza told reporters she was an old bag, she organized a group of female supporters and called them \u201cOld Bags for Barbara.\u201d Sferrazza later denied he called her names during a call with reporters after Vucanovich won the GOP primary. He said one of his supporters had impersonated him, although reporters who knew his voice stood by their stories.\n\nAnyone who paid attention to the U.S. Senate contests between Sen. Dean Heller, R-Nev., and former Rep. Shelley Berkley, D-Nev., in 2012 and between Sen. Harry Reid, D-Nev., and GOP foe Sharron Angle in 2010 witnessed the meanest of campaigns where male contenders hit hard and fast.\n\nSue Lowden, who lost the GOP primary to tea party favorite Angle, blamed the Reid campaign for taking her out early by making fun of her remarks about health care and feeding the media other opposition research.\n\nAfter Lowden said people could barter for health care like people did in rural areas and older times, Democratic operatives began following her around dressed in a chicken suit. One even voted in costume on primary Election Day to remind voters of her gaffe.\n\nLowden, a former state senator who is running for lieutenant governor in 2014, said attacks come with the job.\n\n\u201cYou have to have a very thick skin to be in politics,\u201d said Lowden, who had been considered the strongest Reid opponent. \u201cAnd you have to know that nothing is sacred. Everything you\u2019ve ever done is under scrutiny.\u201d\n\nJones, the popular Las Vegas mayor who ran for governor two times, maintained that women get far rougher treatment from opponents and the media than men. She said photos often highlight awkward or unflattering poses, with more attention paid to fashion and emotion in women.\n\nU.S. House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, is known for breaking into tears at emotional moments. Voters seem to think it\u2019s endearing in men \u2014 at least these days if not in earlier political times \u2014 but tearful women politicians are usually portrayed as weak or unstable, Jones said.\n\nAt one of her gubernatorial debates, Jones said she cried because she was thinking about a friend who had told her earlier in the day that she had been diagnosed with a fatal disease.\n\n\u201cI was thinking about that\u201d and not breaking down because of the debate, Jones said.\n\nAs for her wardrobe, including high heels and flashy skirts, Jones said she couldn\u2019t win.\n\n\u201cIf you dressed boring, they say you\u2019re boring,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you dressed like yourself, you\u2019re flamboyant. There is an innate misogyny in politics. It\u2019s subtle discrimination.\u201d\n\nEXPERT: WOMEN TREATED THE SAME\n\nFor the most part, however, women candidates are treated the same as men in modern politics, according to Jennifer Duffy, an analyst with The Cook Political Report.\n\nThere are still some areas \u201cin which male candidates have to tread lightly against women opponents,\u201d Duffy added. \u201cComments about appearance, intelligence and family (unless there is some pretty compelling fodder \u2014 e.g., Mr. Shelley Berkley) are still pretty off limits.\u201d\n\nWhile the U.S. House Ethics Committee found Rep. Shelley Berkley, D-Nev., violated House rules and standards of conduct by allowing her staff to make calls to federal agencies on behalf of her husband\u2019s medical practice. it also concluded he was not afforded \u201cspecial favors,\u201d and the action taken on his behalf \u201cwas not unusual compared to the assistance her office provided to other physicians.\u201d The case against Berkley was dismissed with no penalty.\n\nDuffy said women don\u2019t come off well if they complain about any ill treatment.\n\n\u201cWe have long moved past the point in which a female candidate can complain about her male opponent going negative,\u201d Duffy said. \u201cIt looks like she is whining and can\u2019t take the heat of a campaign. It makes voters wonder whether she can take the heat of elected office.\u201d\n\nBilbray\u2019s comments about Heck came during an Oct. 23 appearance on \u201cRalston Reports,\u201d hosted by Jon Ralston on KSNV-TV Channel 3. She took offense at a fundraising email Heck issued on the day she entered the race. It called her a \u201cliberal activist, fundraiser and Democratic spin-doctor.\u201d\n\n\u201cI announced on July 1 with a very positive message about my family, my values, and I was just actually surprised by the negative tone that he immediately took this far out,\u201d said Bilbray, a political trainer who established Emerge Nevada, an organization that trains women for politics.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have enough women in politics, and the reason they don\u2019t want to get involved is because of the negativity that Joe Heck expressed on that first day,\u201d she said. \u201cThe classy thing to do, the gentlemanly thing to do that early, is to say I welcome somebody to participate in politics; and he didn\u2019t do it. As a woman, you don\u2019t come out of the box and attack your opponent this far out.\u201d\n\nShe also called Heck anti-woman and un-American, comments that brought her much criticism.\n\nBILBRAY EXPLAINS HER REACTION\n\nBilbray, during an interview with the Review-Journal last week, said she knows she\u2019s in for a tough election battle and is prepared to fight back. She just didn\u2019t think Heck would come out of his corner swinging so soon, she explained.\n\n\u201cPolitics in general has become so negative and nasty; I think that has created this partisan culture in Washington, D.C. I think it\u2019s (negative campaigning) working to win elections, but it\u2019s not working to improve Washington, D.C., and the economy.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I was trying to say,\u201d she added. \u201cIt\u2019s not statesmanlike or stateswomanlike to start a campaign so negative and nasty. \u2026 I plan on fighting back, but people know me as a dignified person.\u201d\n\nHeck\u2019s campaign manager, Mark Ciavola, said the congressman\u2019s email was not a negative attack, but an accurate description of Bilbray\u2019s job as a political consultant and manager.\n\n\u201cThere was nothing in that email that even referred to her as a woman,\u201d Ciavola said.\n\nHe believes the effort to paint Heck as anti-woman is pulled from the \u201cDemocratic playbook\u201d as a way for the party\u2019s female candidates to go after Republican male politicians.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s more strategy than reality,\u201d Ciavola said.\n\nBilbray maintains Heck\u2019s voting record isn\u2019t friendly to women, including voting against equal pay for women. Heck voted against a procedural effort to move forward on the Paycheck Fairness Act, but he has not voted on the legislation itself.\n\nCiavola said Heck, who successfully ousted Rep. Dina Titus, D-Nev., to win in the 3rd Congressional District in 2010, doesn\u2019t plan to treat Bilbray any differently than he would a male opponent if she wins the Democratic primary in 2014.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any reason to treat any candidate differently, male or female,\u201d Ciavola said.\n\nContact reporter Laura Myers at lmyers@reviewjournal.com or 702-387-2919.
