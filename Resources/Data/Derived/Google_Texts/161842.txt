Sioux Falls, SD

Hundreds of Sioux Falls area students are counting down the hours until Saturday morning.

Starting at 9 a.m. they'll be able to pick up their backpacks and school supplies at Whittier Middle School.

And thanks to Project SOS, and the community's generosity, families with limited resources won't have to pay a cent.

There are a few things you should know before you go

Children need to be present and with an adult. They also need identification, such as a passport or library card.

The giveaway goes until 4 p.m.
