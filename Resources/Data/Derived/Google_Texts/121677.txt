President Barack Obama was supposed to make a “surprise” appearance on Jimmy Kimmel Live last night during his fundraising trip to Los Angeles. But the the Malaysia Airlines passenger jet got shot down over Ukraine and Israel went to war in Gaza and then whole thing started to seem poorly timed.

Kimmel opted not to address Obama’s cancelation directly during last night’s show, but he did open his monologue with some digs at the president, who was making LA’s notoriously awful traffic even worse.

“He’s here in town to go to fundraisers, where he will spend the evening pretending to care about what celebrities think,” Kimmel said. “I feel like the president only comes to LA for money. He’s like a college student who comes home to do laundry and steal food from the refrigerator.”

Pointing out that the secret service had already shut down several major streets for President Obama, Kimmel said, “a good way to ensure that you’re approval rating remains in the low 40s is to see to it that it takes three and a half hours for everyone to get home from work.”

Think someone’s a little upset about the presidential snub?
