Three of the five members of Lorraine Hansberry‘s Younger family from “A Raisin in the Sun” were nominated for Tony awards this year. WSJ Cafe spoke to LaTanya Richardson Jackson, Anika Noni Rose, and Sophie Okonedo about playing the three women in the sold out production at the Barrymore Theater.

Ms. Richardson Jackson discusses her last minute acceptance of the role and having to slap Ms. Rose every night; Ms. Okonedo on why she’s so exhausted; and Ms. Rose on what winning a Tony actually does for one’s career — and what it’s like to be slapped every night.
