And, I believe, in that particular situation, that she wants a diplomatic situation after it\u2019s been so long of an ongoing crisis that a diplomatic solution is less likely to be had.\n\nWhen the topic arose about an additional American show of force in the region, including stationing American military equipment in the region, Gianno added:\n\nIt\u2019s better for us to have a presence and be prepared just in case than to have nothing there at all\u2026 We\u2019ve seen time and again that with conflicts like these \u2014 they may start off as small, but they grow big and become detrimental to our safety as well.\n\nSwitching gears to the invitation for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to address Congress, and domestic political fallout over it, Gianno said:\n\nI kind of disagree with Speaker Boehner breaking protocol. However, I think it might have been necessary to hear from the Israeli people to [determine] what their thoughts are so we can come up with a real strategy [for the Middle East] moving forward.\n\nAsked about the feelings of lawmakers he has interacted with, Gianno added:\n\nFolks are more willing to hear from the prime minister directly so they can get his views, and also directly have a communication link to him, rather than going through [the White House].\n\nFellow panelist Wendy Patrick, a legal commentator, noted, \u201cthat last point, I think, is excellent.\u201d\n\nGianno also called hip-hop star Akon \u201cadmirable\u201d for planning to hold a concert to raise funds for anti-ISIS forces fighting the terrorists in Kurdistan. Besides the monetary support Akon is bringing to the fight, Gianno said there is a valuable cultural benefit as well:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://www.conservativeblog.org/storage/CaldwellOANN2915.jpg?__SQUARESPACE_CACHEVERSION=1423606951131", "description": "&ldquo;Brian Williams&rsquo; career at NBC is dead,&rdquo; said Project 21 member...", "title": "Gianno Caldwell's Project 21 Media Debut Tackles Ukraine, ISIS and Other Foreign Policy Issues \u2014 and Brian\u00a0Williams - Amy Ridenour's National Center Blog - A Conservative Blog"}, "blogburst-verify": "B9EORVLmLdD0z2JKwETUEmoZ", "Robots": "index,follow"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0617\"", "article_summary": "Besides the monetary support Akon is bringing to the fight, Gianno said there is a valuable cultural benefit as well:\n\u201cBrian Williams\u2019 career at NBC is dead,\u201d said Project 21 member Gianno Caldwell, \u201cbut it\u2019s alive and well if he wants a job at TMZ.\u201dGianno made a big splash during his first appearance on the One America News Network and first live media for Project 21!\nAnd, I believe, in that particular situation, that she wants a diplomatic situation after it\u2019s been so long of an ongoing crisis that a diplomatic solution is less likely to be had.\nSwitching gears to the invitation for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to address Congress, and domestic political fallout over it, Gianno said:I kind of disagree with Speaker Boehner breaking protocol.\nHowever, I think it might have been necessary to hear from the Israeli people to [determine] what their thoughts are so we can come up with a real strategy [for the Middle East] moving forward."}
