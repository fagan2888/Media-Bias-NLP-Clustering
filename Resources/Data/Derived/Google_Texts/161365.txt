Medical marijuana and other health-related freshmen housing exemptions 2015-2014: 0 2014-2015: 4 2013-2014: 10 2012-2013: 7 2011-2012: 17 2010-2011:7 Source: University of Colorado *University officials could not locate data for 2008-2009 and 2009-2010.

Though it welcomed the largest freshman class on record this year, the University of Colorado saw zero new students get out of their mandatory housing contract because they had a medical marijuana card, according to new statistics.

Though freshmen are typically required to live in dorms during their first year on the Boulder campus, the university makes an exception for students with a medical condition that a doctor says can be treated with marijuana. CU also allows students who are married or who live with a parent or guardian to apply for an exemption. Freshmen over 21 also are exempt.

The number of medical marijuana exemptions, which are lumped together with other health and medical circumstances, has fluctuated every year since then with no apparent pattern, according to CU spokesman Ryan Huff.

The numbers make up a fraction of 1 percent of the entering class, which has grown from about 5,100 in 2010 to 6,200 students in 2015, Huff said.

"As you can see with these stats, there are not any explainable trends," Huff wrote in an email. "Each class is different; the student body coming to us as freshmen each year have their own unique indentities and it would be difficult to pinpoint why one class had more than another."

The school first instituted the exemption during the 2008-2009 academic year as a way to "balance" the differences between state, federal and university rules around marijuana, said Paula Bland, director of residence life.

CU-Boulder, and other colleges receiving federal funds, are drug-free zones, despite the fact that the 2012 passage of Colorado's Amendment 64 allows people 21 and over to consume marijuana and possess up to an ounce of marijuana.

"How do you try to balance all of those things?" Bland said. "We felt like it was the fair and right thing to do to release them without any penalty."

It's unclear how many CU-Boulder students have medical marijuana cards.

According to 2015 data from the National College Health Assessment, 7 percent of CU-Boulder students surveyed reported daily marijuana usage within the last 30 days. Roughly 35 percent of CU-Boulder students surveyed, however, said they'd never consumed marijuana.

As of July 2015, the most recent data available, the state's public health department received 304,858 applications for medical marijuana cards since the registry began in 2001. There were 113,862 total active patients in the state.

Patients ages 18 to 20 — the group most likely to include college freshmen — made up 5.2 percent of all registered medical marijuana users.

There were 8,110 patients from Boulder County, a figure that represents 7.1 percent of the state's overall medical marijuana registry.
