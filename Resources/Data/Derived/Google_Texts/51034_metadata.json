Perhaps surprisingly, given that many frontier and emerging countries are net oil importers, the slump in prices has taken a heavy toll on investor sentiment.\n\nSince mid June when oil prices began their slide, the MSCI Frontier Market index has skidded by over 11%. The MSCI Emerging Market Index has lost more than 9%.\n\nMichael Levy, who manages UK-based Barings\u2019 frontier markets fund, says the sell-off may be overdone. \u201cMany frontier markets are net oil importers and\u2026should benefit from the oil price fall,\u201d he says. Levy believes Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and Kenya are particularly well placed to benefit from cheaper oil. Even Nigeria and Saudi Arabia could present some interesting opportunities in the wake of the sell-off.\n\nNgozi Okonjo-Iweala. Reuters\n\nInvestors in Nigeria might be hard-pressed to find any cause for optimism, though. The naira, Nigeria\u2019s currency, has crumbled in tandem with falling oil prices and the economy looks set to suffer, too. In an exclusive interview with the Journal, finance minister Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala admitted that growth could slow noticeably and the country would have to raise taxes and cut spending to compensate for falling oil prices.\n\nUkraine, another frontier market that is in the news for all the wrong reasons, is starting to exhibit clear signs of the catastrophic long-term damage that the ongoing strife is causing. The country\u2019s president, Petro Poroshenko, laid out his vision for the future in an editorial in the Journal, triggering a lively debate on WSJ Frontiers.\n\nEthiopia provided some much-needed cheer among the gloom with its successful \u2014 and oversubscribed \u2014 $1 billion bond issue. And Sri Lanka\u2019s central banker told the Journal the country was considering dipping its toe in the Chinese offshore bond market having already raised $1.9 billion in dollar-denominated bonds this year.\n\nBangladesh, another oft-overlooked frontier market with considerable promise, also provided some relief. Our Dhaka-based reporter Zain Al-mahmood writes that a consortium of global retailers has established a scheme to help apparel businesses in Bangladesh ensure their factories meet international safety standards.\n\nFocus: Africa \u2018Must Rethink Approach to Agriculture Investment\u2019\n\nAziz Akhannouch. Dan Keeler/The Wall Street Journal\n\nThe future could be bright for Africa\u2019s agriculture. But to realize its full potential the continent\u2019s governments need to rethink their approach to encouraging investment, Morocco\u2019s Agriculture Minister Aziz Akhannouch says.\n\nIn an exclusive interview with WSJ Frontiers, Akhannouch discusses the success of his country\u2019s efforts to boost agricultural production and the lessons other African countries could learn from Morocco\u2019s experiences. He presents a compelling case: agricultural output under Morocco\u2019s \u2018Plan Vert\u2019 is up over 40% in six years.\n\nKey Stories from WSJ Frontiers\n\nVietnam\u2019s Trade With South Korea Set to Double as Trade Pact is Finalized\n\nICC Withdraws Charges Against Kenyan President\n\nArgentina Offers to Pay Cash for Bonds Maturing in 2015\n\nVenezuela Cuts Spending as Oil Prices Plummet\n\nFall in Oil Prices Threatens Africa\u2019s Economic Growth\n\nAround the Web\n\nSri Lankan Champ: John Keells Holdings became the biggest of the 34 companies in the MSCI Frontier Markets Asia Index.\n\nUps and Downs in Nigeria: Templeton\u2019s Mark Mobius looks beyond Nigeria\u2019s current travails and sees a brightening picture.\n\nFrontier Favorites: T.
