Revenues into the Highway Trust Fund must increase to support this much needed growth.\u201d\n\nThe federal government\u2019s current transportation funding measure is scheduled to expire on May 31.\n\nLawmakers in both parties have expressed a desire to prevent an interruption in funding, but consensus on how to pay for an extension of the infrastructure funding has been elusive.\n\nThe typical source of transportation funding has been revenue that is collected from the 18.4-cents-per-gallon gas tax. The gas tax brings in about $34 billion per year, but the federal government typically spends approximately $50 billion on transportation projects.\n\nLawmakers have turned to other areas of the federal budget in recent years to close the shortfall, but transportation advocates have said the patches are weakening the nation\u2019s infrastructure because they make it more difficult for states to plan long-term construction projects.\n\nThe Department of Transportation has said, meanwhile, that it will have to start cutting off payments to states in July if Congress does not pass a transportation funding fix because its Highway Trust Fund will run out of money.\n\nThe chairman of the Senate Banking Committee expressed reservations about the request to increase funding for transit agencies on Thursday, though he said he would also prefer a long-term fix for the transportation funding shortfall.\n\n\u201cA long-term reauthorization bill will provide certainty and stability to communities and their citizens as well as business and industry,\u201d Sen. Richard Shelby (R-Ala.) said. \u201cHowever, any reauthorization proposal Congress considers must be fiscally responsible and balance spending needs with long-term sustainability, flexibility, and innovation.\u201d\n\nShelby said in a hearing about transportation funding earlier this week that transit systems may have to turn to private companies to finance their large projects.\n\n\"Federal policies should encourage private sector investment in transportation and transit infrastructure in order to better leverage federal investments and increase economic growth,\" he said during a hearing on Tuesday that featured testimony from officials with the Federal Transit Administration.\n\nBusiness and labor groups told the panel Thursday that they supported the idea of increasing the federal government\u2019s transit funding \u2014 a moment of rare agreement.\n\n\u201cBusinesses place a high value on mobility \u2014 of their employees, customers and supply chains \u2014 and are solution orientations,\u201d Chamber of Commerce Transportation and Infrastructure Executive Director Janet Kavinoky said in testimony submitted to ahead of Thursday\u2019s hearing.\n\n\u201cThis country is long past the time when highways alone can serve the needs of business,\u201d Kavinoky continued. \u201cTo create a 21st century infrastructure to support a 21st century requires a partnership between all levels of government and the private sector, multiple modes of transportation and flexibility for those closest to the problem to tailor solutions to their particular needs.\u201d\n\nTransport Workers Union of America President Harry Lombardo added that Congress should boost transit funding to make up for years of underinvestment.\n\n\"We have to both maintain our systems and modernize them,\u201d he said.\n\nLombardo also told the panel that public-private partnerships are not a clear-cut solution to the federal government's transportation funding problem.\n\n\"We need to stop thinking that Public Private Partnerships are a panacea for transit,\" he said. \"In fact, in many cases, P3\u2019s threaten the public interest by undermining commitments to timely and safe transit service, and to workers, wages and retirement security.\"\n\n\u2014This story was updated at 1:32 p.m.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "The
