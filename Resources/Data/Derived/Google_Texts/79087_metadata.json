It was a decision her parents didn't understand at the time, but now that Alexis is gone, it all makes sense.\n\nAlexis collapsed after a workout at home. She went into cardiac arrest, then an induced coma, before she died Friday.\n\n\"She went into some type of convulsion, I was screaming her name and she didn't wake up and then I called 911,\" her mother Kim said.\n\nHer father Louis described his last words to his daughter. \"'Alexis, I'll meet you at the hospital, I love you.' Those were the last words I said to her.\"\n\nKim described finding out about Alexis' decision to be an organ donor.\n\n\"You don't think of it at the time. At the time as her mom I'm thinking no, you're crazy don't do that, what's wrong with you?\"\n\nBut now it makes sense, they said.\n\n\"She's a brave, strong girl and knowing that someone is going to be able to get out of that hospital and on with their lives...\" said Stephanie Mendoza, a friend of Alexis.\n\nOn Saturday, HealthPark raised a flag to honor Alexis' decision to donate, a choice her parents said proves what type of person their daughter was.\n\n\"It was completely her decision, you know, sitting while she was laying there. If there is anything that could've been done for her, I would've wished that some other teenager would've been as thoughtful and kind,\" Kim said.\n\nThose considering becoming an organ donor can make that decision online.", "article_metadata": {"wn-build": "XSLT-7.1-17", "Description": "Family and friends gathered Saturday to remember Alexis Bonadies, who was a sophomore at Riverdale High School.", "og": {"url": "http://www.abc-7.com/story/31216677/riverdale-student-dies-suddenly-leaves-behind-a-gift", "image": "http://ftpcontent.worldnow.com/wncustom/custom/wzvn/wzvn_og_image.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Family and friends gathered Saturday to remember Alexis Bonadies, who was a sophomore at Riverdale High School.", "title": "Riverdale student dies suddenly, leaves behind a gift"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://WZVN.images.worldnow.com/images/9877710_G.jpg", "description": "Family and friends gathered Saturday to remember Alexis Bonadies, who was a sophomore at Riverdale High School.", "card": "summary", "title": "Riverdale student dies suddenly, leaves behind a gift"}, "wnreadableurl": "riverdale-student-dies-suddenly-leaves-behind-a-gift", "ROBOTS": "index,follow,noarchive", "owner": "WZVN", "fb": {"admins": 1851799707, "app_id": 1678378052403648}, "date": "2016/02/13", "google-site-verification": "gcWGJ_5HBMygrFxFQLREn-pvEzLmkYG-FQepn2WoVSk", "wn-version": "ContainerE-Story", "wn-base": "IIS10"}, "article_summary": "Kim described finding out about Alexis' decision to be an organ donor.\nIt was a decision her parents didn't understand at the time, but now that Alexis is gone, it all makes sense.\nOn Saturday, HealthPark raised a flag to honor Alexis' decision to donate, a choice her parents said proves what type of person their daughter was.\nFamily and friends gathered Saturday at HealthPark Medical Center to remember Alexis Bonadies, who was a sophomore at Riverdale High School.\nWhen Alexis, 15, got her learner's permit, she made sure to become an organ donor."}
