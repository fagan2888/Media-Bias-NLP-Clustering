Ice Cube was on The Graham Norton Show on Friday and was questioned about his reaction to the #OscarsSoWhite debate.

“You can’t boycott something that you never went to anyway. That’s kinda weird. I look at it like a horse race. Once your horse loses the race, you tear up the ticket, go home. Back on out. We don’t do movies for the industry, we do movies for the fans, for the people. And you know, the industry, if they give you a trophy or not, or they pat you on the back or not, it’s nice but it’s not something you should dwell on," he said.
