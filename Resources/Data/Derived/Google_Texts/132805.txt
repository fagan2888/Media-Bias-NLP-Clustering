A combination of deadpan humor and old-timey drawings has transformed Someecards into the Hallmark of the web, with 7 million unique visitors a month. How else could you deliver a romantic note like “Just sending a preemptive apology, since Valentine’s Day can’t possibly live up to your expectations”? Cofounder and head writer Brook Lundy designed the cards to be the antithesis of the musical color-bomb ecards of yesteryear. He issues a daily assignment to contributors and matches the wittiest responses to anachronistic illustrations culled from image databases. We talked to Lundy about how Someecards has redefined (and profited from) the lowly ecard.

What’s the Someecards style? Sarcastic? Cynical?

I’d say honest. It’s probably closer to Curb Your Enthusiasm and Seinfeld, because it’s a bit absurd too. We like to play off the minutiae of life and call attention to it in a funny way. When you’re being honest, stuff comes out that people usually don’t talk about because it’s dark, dirty, or inappropriate.

You’re trying to be more honest than funny?

It’s the goal. Does everyone really hate Red Sox fans? Do women’s nipples get erect when it’s cold? That’s the fact-checking we’re always doing. If you nail the honesty, you don’t have to work too hard at the make-it-funny

part.

And you make money this way?

The cards are free, but we make money from the ones we create for advertisers like Ford and Clorox. We’ve made them for shows like The Walking Dead and Modern Family. We combine the tone of Someecards with the voice or plot points of the show and release them online the same way as our other cards.

How many cards do you create each day?

We aim for six to 10, but it depends on the day and what’s happening. Ecards about Obamacare, no one gives a shit about. But if Miley Cyrus does something crazy, that can give us fodder for the day. Kim Kardashian getting engaged, that was a gold mine.
