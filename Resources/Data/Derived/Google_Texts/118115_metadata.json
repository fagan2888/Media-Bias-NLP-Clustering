The donation helped increase Mayo's revenue from development gifts by 63 percent from the previous year.\n\nMayo also saw an increase in the number of patients across its organization. Its doctors treated more than 1.26 million patients at its network of clinics and hospitals, an increase of 8 percent over last year. In addition to major campuses in Rochester, Jacksonville, Fla., and Phoenix, Mayo operates primary-care clinics in 70 communities in Iowa, Georgia, Wisconsin and Minnesota.\n\nThat boost in patient care drove a 6 percent increase in revenue, to $9.4 billion. Expenses rose just 4.3 percent, to $8.8 billion as Mayo, the state's largest employer, shrank its staff, largely through attrition.\n\nThe company trimmed its total ranks by about 2.6 percent, to 59,509 employees nationwide. In Rochester, the workforce declined about 3 percent to 33,179.\n\nAbout 25 health care systems are now part of the Mayo Clinic Care Network, which Mayo described as the \"centerpiece\" of its \"evolved health care delivery model.\" The partnership enables Mayo clinicians to work with local doctors to keep some patients closer to home for care, while directing more complex cases to one of Mayo's three hospital centers. About 7 million patients received treatment through the network last year.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Star Tribune", "description": "Net income rose 55 percent at the Mayo Clinic during 2013 as the Rochester-based system of hospitals and clinics treated more patients and attracted more in donations.", "title": "Net income up 55 percent at Mayo Clinic for 2013", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/net-income-up-55-percent-at-mayo-clinic-for-2013/247400891/", "image": {"url": "http://assets.startribune.com/static/img/branding/logos/strib-social-card.png?d=1464031764", "width": 1680, "identifier": "http://assets.startribune.com/static/img/branding/logos/strib-social-card.png?d=1464031764", "height": 876}, "type": "article"}, "google-site-verification": "bLXTXkzm4dJ8hcJy1LXawtxXxGP3JhInARj69uCiMiM", "twitter": {"description": "Net income rose 55 percent at the Mayo Clinic during 2013 as the Rochester-based system of hospitals and clinics treated more patients and attracted more in donations.", "title": "Net income up 55 percent at Mayo Clinic for 2013", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/net-income-up-55-percent-at-mayo-clinic-for-2013/247400891/", "image": {"src": "http://assets.startribune.com/static/img/branding/logos/strib-social-card.png?d=1464031764", "identifier": "http://assets.startribune.com/static/img/branding/logos/strib-social-card.png?d=1464031764"}, "site": "@StarTribune", "card": "summary"}, "description": "Net income rose 55 percent at the Mayo Clinic during 2013 as the Rochester-based system of hospitals and clinics treated more patients and attracted more in donations."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe201b\"", "article_summary": "About 25 health care systems are now part of the Mayo Clinic Care Network, which Mayo described as the \"centerpiece\" of its \"evolved health care delivery model.\"\nNet income rose 55 percent at the Mayo Clinic during 2013 as the Rochester-based system of hospitals and clinics treated more patients and attracted more in donations.\nThe donation helped increase Mayo's revenue from development gifts by 63 percent from the previous year.\nFor the year, Mayo reported $612 million in net operating income, a margin of 6.5 percent, which is at the high end of its traditional target of 4 to 6 percent.\nAbout 7 million patients received treatment through the network last year."}
