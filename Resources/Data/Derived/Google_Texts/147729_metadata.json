And the practice, Emanuel OB/GYN Clinic, owned by the hospital, will soon be closing as well.\n\nMany of her low-income patients have no transportation, and they either walk or have to get rides from friends or relatives to get to their appointments.\n\nWhen the closures come, those of Banks-Jackson\u2019s patients who do have cars will be driving 30 to 40 minutes to other counties to deliver their babies, said her office manager, Ashley Williamson. Some patients may wind up delivering in the local emergency room, Williamson added.\n\nEmanuel Medical Center, citing high costs and low reimbursements, decided last month to close the hospital\u2019s obstetrical program June 30.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m 100 percent positive we\u2019ll have worsening [patient] outcomes as a county,\u2019\u2019 Banks-Jackson said Monday. For patients without a car, \u201cI seriously doubt they\u2019ll get prenatal care.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe shuttering of the labor and delivery unit follows similar actions by other hospitals across the state. The obstetrical closures have hit especially hard in rural Georgia, where health care has been imperiled by doctor shortages and shaky hospital finances.\n\nMore than 40 Georgia counties lack obstetrical providers, and fewer than 75 of 180 hospitals in the state have labor and delivery units, Pat Cota of the Georgia OB/GYN Society said.\n\nCota said that when access to obstetrical services is reduced, women have to travel greater distances for prenatal care and deliveries. That increases the chances for a pre-term delivery, she said.\n\nOne reason for the obstetrical closures is that it\u2019s difficult to maintain a high-cost service with low reimbursement rates from Medicaid. The government insurance program covers about 60 percent of all Georgia births, and the rate is even higher in rural areas.\n\nGeorgia OB/GYNs finally received a Medicaid pay increase \u2014 the first in more than a decade \u2014 under the recently approved state budget. Yet that won\u2019t increase the reimbursements to a hospital itself, which deals with the high costs of staffing in its birthing program.\n\nAnd Georgia\u2019s rural hospitals, unlike those in some other states, are not getting a revenue boost from Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act. Expansion would extend Medicaid coverage to more low-income patients, meaning the hospitals that treat them would get more revenue. But Georgia is among the states that have rejected Medicaid expansion, saying it\u2019s too costly.\n\nThe two sides of mobility\n\nBesides Emanuel Medical, another Georgia hospital recently announced a July closing of a labor and delivery unit: Barrow Regional Medical Center in Winder.\n\nLocated between populous Gwinnett County and Athens-Clarke County, Barrow is much less rural than Emanuel County. It\u2019s also more affluent, with most people having access to transportation.\n\nChad Conner, Barrow Regional\u2019s marketing director, said the hospital has delivered fewer than 115 babies per year for the past three years. Most of Barrow County\u2019s pregnant women are instead going to neighboring counties for delivery, he said.\n\n\u201cWe made this decision [to close the delivery unit] so we can focus on other areas that are doing well and will benefit the community more,\u2019\u2019 Conner said, citing emergency services, primary care and orthopedics.\n\nA hospital needs at least 350 deliveries a year to break even in its obstetrical service, according to Jimmy Lewis, CEO of HomeTown Health, an organization of rural hospitals in the state.\n\nThat\u2019s a difficult number to reach in a rural county, he added.\n\n\u201cWhen a labor and delivery unit closes, there is little prenatal or postnatal care,\u2019\u2019 Lewis said. There\u2019s a much higher probability of a birth problem, he added.\n\nGeorgia\u2019s preterm birth rate has improved in recent years, but the state has the highest maternal mortality rate in the nation.\n\nEmanuel looks to the future\n\nEmanuel Medical officials, in announcing the obstetrical closure, said that over the past four years, there has been an average of 326 births annually to Emanuel County women.\n\nAbout two-thirds of these births have been delivered out of the county in larger neighboring hospitals. \u201cAs a result, the small number of deliveries at Emanuel Medical Center is not sustainable,\u201d the hospital said in a news release.\n\nStill, Mel Pyne, regional CEO for Emanuel Medical, said in a statement that the hospital has seen \u201csignificant growth in ER services, outpatient procedures, and other medical services.\u201d\n\nAnd he noted that the hospital was selected as one of four hospitals to participate in Gov. Nathan Deal\u2019s pilot project that will use telemedicine and other techniques to bolster rural health care in Georgia.\n\nBut to fill obstetrical gaps, Lewis of HomeTown Health suggests that counties subsidize that service, or that the state sets up regional birthing centers.\n\nCota of the OB/GYN Society said that once a hospital closes its obstetrical program, \u201cit\u2019s almost impossible to reopen it.\u201d\n\nMore hospitals in the states may eventually close these units, Cota said.\n\nShe said she would like to see a statewide group of experts formed to put together a plan to retain labor and delivery services \u201cso we can preserve access to health care for women.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "SWAINSBORO, GA. | Dr. Roslyn Banks-Jackson worries about what will happen to many women of Emanuel County when the local hospital shuts its labor and delivery unit.
