Other Robertson opinions surfaced that African-Americans before the Civil Rights Movement were happily singing in the cotton fields, and that men who cook are \u201cgirly men.\u201d I found my Cousin Ray Sixkiller in his backyard frying a turkey, and he wanted to know what kind of opinions people expect \u201cfrom a guy whose claim to fame is talking to ducks?\u201d\n\nOn Friday night\u2019s Hardball, Ron Reagan (son of the late President) responded to video of Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal and Sarah Palin in her most festive Christmas camo defending \u201cfree speech rights\u201d of Phil Robertson as if the First Amendment restrained corporate persons: \u201cThese are the same people who were wanting a boycott of stores where they say 'Happy Holidays' instead of 'Merry Christmas.'\u201d Cousin Ray was shocked at Mr. Reagan\u2019s lack of hypocrisy tolerance. \u201cDidn\u2019t he learn anything from his dad?\u201d\n\nAbout 10 percent of the 720 people in the audience were injured in the collapse of the ceiling during a performance at the Apollo Theatre in London. Cousin Ray observed that the actors \u201cgave a whole new meaning to bringing down the house.\u201d\n\nCharles Blow published an op-ed in the Saturday New York Times about the racial fantasies of the Duck Dynasty dude. Cousin Ray again asked why Mr. Blow would expect a history lesson from the duck whisperer? \u201cMaybe the ducks told him the back of the bus was just ducky.\u201d\n\nThe Sunday New York Times carried a feature article on the difficulties Justin Bieber has had growing up, claiming Mr. Bieber has been caught leaving a Brazilian whorehouse, painting racist graffiti, spitting on his fans, peeing in a mop bucket and \u201cwriting goofy things in the visitor book at Anne Frank\u2019s house.\u201d That sounds like great material, if we knew who Justin Bieber is and why we should care that he\u2019s acting the fool. Cousin Ray piped up helpfully, \u201cI know who Anne Frank was. Does she count as a celebrity?\u201d I am not informed.\n\nJohn Eisenhower, the son and biographer of the WWII hero and two term President, died this week. Cousin Ray, a lifetime Republican who has had problems with his party lately, shook his head, \u201cDwight Eisenhower couldn\u2019t get nominated for dog catcher today. They\u2019d call him a squish.\u201d\n\nCousin Ray was chuckling about another article in the Sunday Times, reporting a fad for traditional Hawaiian surfboards, the alaia and the paipo, \u201cdiscovered\u201d by white guys. \u201cThey took their land,\u201d Cousin Ray observed, \u201cand now they are coming for their surfboards.\u201d\n\nThere was an alarming report in the Times, citing many scary cases, about difficulties disarming mentally ill people. Gun rights advocates are opposed because they don\u2019t think the government should ever take away guns and mental health advocates are opposed because they fear mental illness will be even more stigmatized. Cousin Ray wanted to know \u201cWhere are the ordinary people advocates?\u201d\n\n60 Minutes reported on Sunday night that the Denver Post has employed a marijuana critic, but a law professor said it was \u201cnot sustainable\u201d to base a multi-million dollar business on federal crimes. Cousin Ray deadpanned \u201cthat guy doesn\u2019t pay much attention to defense contracting, does he?\u201d\n\nThe San Francisco Chronicle reported on Monday that Apple has cut a deal with China Mobile to sell the iPhone. China Mobile has 763 million of the 1.2 billion wireless subscribers in China. \u201cWow,\u201d said Cousin Ray. \u201cThey are finally going to let the people who make the iPhone use it.\u201d\n\nIf you bought something on plastic at Target between November 27 and December 15, USA Today reports that you better keep an eye on your account because the results of the massive data breach are already showing up. Cousin Ray snickered because I\u2019m always giving him a hard time about shopping at Wally World.\n\nDrew Christie published a Christmas Eve op-doc (video creation) in the New York Times arguing that Santa Claus has left American children soft and unable to compete globally with school kids who have had the laziness scared out of them by the likes of the German Krampus, the Japanese Namahage, or the Icelandic Gryla. Cousin Ray agreed that scaring kids would be cheaper than presents, \u201cbut what would we do on Halloween?\u201d\n\nThe Times reports that Mikhail Kalashnikov has died in Russia at the age of 94. \u201cAK-47\u201d is the Automatic designed by Kalashnikov for a competition that ended in 1947. Production started in 1949 and is estimated at 100 million. The US buys Kalashnikovs for allies in Iraq and Afghanistan. Cause of death was not reported, but Cousin Ray was certain it was not a gunshot. \u201cIrony on that level would not be ignored.\u201d\n\nChicago DJ Larry Lujack passed away from esophageal cancer at age 73. His on air persona was\u2014ahem, unusual\u2014and Rush Limbaugh told the New York Times Magazine that Mr. Lujack \u201cwas the only person I ever copied.\u201d Lujack said of Limbaugh, \u201cHis appeal escapes me.\u201d Cousin Ray said Mr. Lujack and Mr. Limbaugh were \u201cthe difference between funny and mean.\u201d\n\nThere was a Christmas present for the freedom to love in the New York Times, reporting on the Indiana campaign to ban marriage equality, started as a wedge issue for Republicans and now turning into a wedge issue for Democrats. I just retired from teaching the future ruling elite of Indiana, so I\u2019m confident the most conservative among the young don\u2019t have hurting gay people on their political radar. Cousin Ray, in a glass half empty moment, said Hoosier haters should not despair. \u201cThey\u2019ll always have the Miami and the Potawatomi.\u201d\n\nRodolfo Hernandez, 82, died of natural causes. He got the Medal of Honor in the Korean War for charging an enemy position with an inoperable rifle and killing six with his bayonet before falling from his injuries. He came around as his brothers in arms were placing him in a body bag. Cousin Ray said \u201cR.I.P.\u201d\n\nOn the same subject, Pope Francis\u2019s Christmas message continued to push his Church toward more modesty and less aggression. Departing from prepared text, he said \u201cI invite even unbelievers to desire peace.\u201d Cousin Ray agreed that \u201cthe first step to calling off wars is to call off holy wars.\u201d\n\nThe Obama family spent another Christmas in Hawaii, leading the birthers to complain that he has faked his birth in a tourist destination rather than \u201csomewhere real Americans live, like Mississippi.\u201d\n\nFirst Look on Thursday morning featured a report on Rep. Steve King (R-IA) visiting Norway, where he breakfasted on reindeer and lutefisk. The reporter, missing the point, referred to the peculiar dish created with lye as \u201ca type of fish.\u201d Cousin Ray hoped the Congressman \u201cdidn\u2019t eat Rudolph.\u201d\n\nThursday\u2019s New York Times carried a detailed report on 21st century sex toys, including \u201cteledildonics,\u201d \u201cbedroom data mining\u201d and \u201cFundawear,\u201d his and hers underpants with electronic stimulators activated by an iPhone. Cousin Ray observed that Fundawear \u201cwill be stiff competition for Mormon magic underwear.\u201d\n\nSpeaking of Mormons, a federal court in Utah declared that denying gay people the right to marry lacks a \u201crational basis\u201d if you don\u2019t conflate civil marriage with sacramental marriage. Over 700 couples rushed to get married while the state scrambled to appeal, surprising those who thought there were no gay people in Utah.\n\nThe Grocery Manufacturers Association continues a valiant struggle with the Food and Drug Administration for the right to label \u201cfood\u201d containing genetically modified organisms as \u201cnatural.\u201d Cousin Ray did not understand the problem. \u201cOnce you decide to manufacture food, isn\u2019t that genetically modified natural cow out of the barn?\u201d\n\nChase Stuart published a rundown of NFL coaches likely to get pink slips at the end of the season, and one of the predicted goners is Mike Shanahan of the Washington team. Stuart points out that team owner Dan Snyder has never kept a coach for five years and Shanahan is 24-39 overall and 3-12 this year. Cousin Ray said Mr. Snyder should look at the bright sides, a high draft pick and \u201canother year to find a name fit for the Super Bowl.\u201d\n\nFortune released its predictions for 2014 this week, among them that Puerto Rico will go broke and Amazon.com will buy the US Postal Service. Cousin Ray claimed Fortune has it backwards: The Postal Service will go broke and Jeff Bezos will buy Puerto Rico.\n\nReddit was buzzing all week with a discussion about an Indian student who can\u2019t take classes as a visitor at Brigham Young University unless he cuts his hair. Many people pointed out that Jesus could not attend BYU. Cousin Ray asked why Jesus would want to? \u201cAre Regents University and Oral Roberts full?\u201d\n\nSince this column is over for 2013, I asked Cousin Ray if he had any message for those dismayed by corrupt tribal governments and dysfunctional US government? \u201cBuck up,\u201d he said, \u201cit could be worse. You could live in Toronto.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The culture war raged all week over anti-gay remarks by Phil Robertson of Duck Dynasty.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.creator": "mazecyrus", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2013/12/27/how-did-i-miss-bieber-mystery-duck-flap-credit-cards-targeted-152872", "type": "article", "image": "http://d1jrw5jterzxwu.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/article_media/screen_shot_2013-12-26_at_3.49.02_pm.png", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "title": "How Did I Miss That?
