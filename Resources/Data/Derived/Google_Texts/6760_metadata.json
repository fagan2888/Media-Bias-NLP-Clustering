The New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival is seven days of rock, R&B, jazz, gospel, food, art and lectures across 12 stages plus food from across southern Louisiana and art by artists from around the area. After Sunday's performances, the festival takes a break until Thursday when the music picks up again.\n\n- HEADLINERS: The high-profile performances Sunday include the Red Hot Chili Peppers and Nick Jonas who will close their respective stages. Rapper J. Cole will close the Congo Square Stage. Cole last week was part of a group of performers at the White House to discuss ways to continue President Barack Obama's \"My Brother's Keeper\" initiative and criminal justice reform.\n\n- ONLY ONE RULE: The singer Elle King, wearing a gold dress with her dreadlocked hair tied behind her and her eyes highlighted in gold shadow, looked to the crowd and asked them to raise their hands and repeat after her: \"Have a good time, all the time.\" It could have been the anthem for the weekend. The weather was amazing as tens of thousands of music fans wrapped up the third day of the seven-day festival. King and her band belted out their fan favorite \"Ex's and Oh's\" to the crowd laying on the grass at the Gentilly Stage. Earlier in the day at the same stage, the sounds of Royal Teeth, a Louisiana indie rock band, flowed over the audience. Dana Pickering had never heard of Royal Teeth but she said that's part of the joy of Jazz Fest: \"We just know, you come to Jazz Fest and you are going to hear the cream of the crop.\"\n\n- DON'T COME ON A DIET: From cochon de lait po-boys to pecan catfish meuniere, food is almost as important at the festival as the music. Thousands of people flocked to stands selling food and drinks distinctive to southern Louisiana on Sunday. Katrina Kiernan was eating a soft-shelled crab po-boy - the local name for sandwiches. During the weekend she'd already tried the crawfish Monica, the cochon de lait po-boy and the crawfish streudel. \"We heard today that it's like 1,000 calories. Who cares?\" she said. \"We're trying it all.\" The food is generally from restaurants or catering companies around the New Orleans area and southern Louisiana.\n\n- A NEW ORLEANS CELLIST: New Orleans musician and singer Leyla McCalla mesmerized the crowd with her songs in French and English. Chatting frequently to the intimate crowd at the Lagniappe Stage, McCalla explained how she moved to New Orleans in 2010 from New York. A classically trained artist, McCalla got her start in the Crescent City by playing on the streets. McCalla first played Jazz Fest in 2012. She alternated between the cello and the banjo Sunday as she sang a list of songs in both English and French, alternating the mournful with upbeat. \"I always feel drawn to those songs that have a back story,\" McCalla told the crowd. She also played the title song to her third album, \"A Day for the Hunter, A Day for the Prey,\" which is scheduled for release in May.\n\n___\n\nFollow Rebecca Santana on Twitter @ruskygal.", "article_metadata": {"description": "New Orleans' premier music festival wrapping up first weekend", "author": "Associated Press", "og": {"site_name": "Daily Herald", "description": "New Orleans' premier music festival wrapping up first weekend", "title": "'Have a good time:' Jazz Fest wraps first weekend", "url": "http://www.dailyherald.com/article/20160424/news/304249950/", "image": "http://www.dailyherald.com/storyimage/DA/20160424/news/304249950/EP/1/11/EP-304249950.jpg&updated=201604241618&imageversion=Facebook&exactH=630&exactW=1200&exactfit=crop&noborder", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "New Orleans' premier music festival wrapping up first weekend", "title": "'Have a good time:' Jazz Fest wraps first weekend", "url": "http://www.dailyherald.com/article/20160424/news/304249950/", "image": "http://www.dailyherald.com/storyimage/DA/20160424/news/304249950/AR/0/AR-304249950.jpg&updated=201604241618&maxw=1200&maxh=1200", "site": "@dailyherald", "card": "summary", "account_id": 8960722}, "robots": "noarchive", "fb": {"app_id": 105603449548761}, "keywords": "News, Nation/World, Associated Press", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/DailyHeraldFans", "published_time": "2016-04-24", "modified_time": "2016-04-24T20:18:00Z"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "'Have a good time:' Jazz Fest wraps first weekendhelloThe Imagination Movers finish their set during the New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival, Sunday, April 24, 2016, in New Orleans.\nThe festival is seven days of rock, R&B, jazz, gospel, food, art and lectures across 12 stages.\nDana Pickering had never heard of Royal Teeth but she said that's part of the joy of Jazz Fest: \"We just know, you come to Jazz Fest and you are going to hear the cream of the crop.\"\nThe New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival is seven days of rock, R&B, jazz, gospel, food, art and lectures across 12 stages plus food from across southern Louisiana and art by artists from around the area.\nMcCalla first played Jazz Fest in 2012."}
