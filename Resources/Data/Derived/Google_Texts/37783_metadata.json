The project gives volunteers the chance to clean, learn about and explore the 91 mile stretch of the Big Sioux River that goes from Sioux Falls to Westfield, IA.\n\nThose who volunteer can help with clean up by paddling the river or by land-based recycling initiatives. The project also offers educational programs at the end of the day. Each program is offered free to the public.\n\nThose who wish to volunteer and clean up, can do so by registering. Registration is not required for those who want to attend the evening programs.\n\nTo avoid a late registration fee, those who want to volunteer are asked to have their registration forms postmarked by June 20.
