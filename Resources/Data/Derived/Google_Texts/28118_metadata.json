His first job after college was a six-month stint on a framing crew in Coeur d\u2019Alene.\n\nAs student body president at the College of Idaho, when the college president proposed converting the then-struggling liberal arts college into a two-year technical college, he made an alternative proposal and the college board went with his. After a multiyear process that involved everyone in the college community, it reinforced its original mission and began growing.\n\nHe and a friend, now his law partner, founded the Kootenai County Young Professionals, with monthly gatherings aimed at attracting and retaining young professionals to the area and helping them feel connected; the group is still going strong.\n\nHe apprenticed with an Athol farrier at age 16 and worked part time shoeing horses through high school and college.\n\nLuke Malek is a young lawyer, a North Idaho resident since the second grade with deep ties in the community, and the son of two local physicians. A Republican, he worked for former Sen. Larry Craig and Sen. Mike Crapo, and was recruited by former Gov. Jim Risch to be the state\u2019s first governor\u2019s representative to North Idaho. He comes from a religious family; his brothers are Matthew, Marc and John.\n\nElected to the state Legislature in 2012, he quickly became a popular and well-respected lawmaker. But he barely squeaked through the GOP primary last year against an unknown newcomer. Welcome to GOP politics in heavily Republican, but still much-divided, Kootenai County.\n\nWhen Malek spoke at a town hall sponsored by the Kootenai County Republican Central Committee meeting early in his first term, the crowd was hostile. He had led a group of freshmen lawmakers who demanded changes in legislation in return for supporting a state insurance exchange under the Affordable Care Act, rather than refusing and forcing Idaho into a federal exchange. John Cross, Region 1 chairman for the Idaho Republican Party and a supporter of Malek\u2019s initial election, shouted, \u201c \u2018I\u2019ve supported you in the past, but I can never support you again,\u2019 \u201d Malek recalled. \u201cHe had his finger pointed at me.\u201d\n\nCross confirmed the story. \u201cSome issues are of super importance and do matter, and matter enough that you might change your opinion about a candidate,\u201d he said.\n\nOthers in the crowd called Malek \u201cworthless\u201d or \u201cjust a Democrat\u201d every time he spoke. Toward the back of the room was Malek\u2019s grandmother, a deeply conservative Republican raised in Wyoming who took umbrage at what she was hearing around her. She turned around to the woman behind her and declared, \u201cHe\u2019s probably more conservative than you are,\u201d Barbara Rousseau, now 82, recalled. \u201cShe didn\u2019t know Luke.\u201d\n\nIt was the start of a fractious relationship between the 33-year-old lawmaker and a core faction of his party, which happens to control the local party apparatus.\n\nKootenai County Sheriff Ben Wolfinger, a lifelong Republican and former city councilman who backs Malek, called it \u201ccomical\u201d that anyone would question Malek\u2019s GOP pedigree. \u201cHe\u2019s got a pretty long history of being a staunch Republican,\u201d Wolfinger said.\n\nIdahoans identify as independents\n\nCross stayed true to his promise and backed Toby Schindelbeck, a little-known recent arrival from California, over Malek in the 2014 GOP primary. Surprisingly, Schindelbeck came within 180 votes of defeating Malek. But the numbers are even more surprising: Just 3,322 people cast ballots in that primary race, in a legislative district with more than 44,000 residents and nearly 22,500 registered voters.\n\nIt was Idaho\u2019s second closed Republican primary election for the Legislature, when only those who registered as Republicans could participate. Previously, Idahoans hadn\u2019t had to register by party, and many take pleasure in calling themselves independents. The month of the primary election, nearly 14,000 of the district\u2019s registered voters were registered as \u201cunaffiliated\u201d with any party \u2013 meaning they couldn\u2019t vote in the GOP race. Only 6,407 had registered as Republicans.\n\nCross, a retired Southern California police officer who arrived in Coeur d\u2019Alene in 1997, said he backed the closed primary and believes party members should be the ones selecting their nominees. Currently, every partisan elected officeholder in the county is a Republican and the county\u2019s election results have shown much higher GOP support than its voter registration figures.\n\n\u201cI frankly don\u2019t know why they do not want to affiliate with the party, if they\u2019re going to vote that way in the end,\u201d Cross said. \u201cI mean, what are we hiding from?\u201d\n\nJasper LiCalzi, a professor of political economy at the College of Idaho, said, \u201cIdahoans, you\u2019ll have somebody who votes Republican all the time but will tell you \u2018I\u2019m an independent.\u2019 And the same thing with Democrats, too.\u201d\n\nHe said in heavily GOP-dominated Idaho \u2013 where every statewide elected office and 80 percent of the seats in the Legislature are held by Republicans \u2013 \u201cthe problem is not enough people who identify, really, by their voting record as Republicans register as Republicans.\u201d\n\nThat leaves a small group making the call in the primary, with little competition in Idaho\u2019s general elections. After beating Schindelbeck in the primary, Malek was unopposed in the November 2014 general election and received more than 8,700 votes.\n\nSchindelbeck said he moved to North Idaho thinking he\u2019d \u201cbe around like-minded people, conservatives.\u201d But, he said, \u201cCome to find out, you can\u2019t really get elected in Kootenai County unless you\u2019re a Republican. Come to find out, what the liberal Democrats would do is run as Republicans.\u201d Schindelbeck said Malek \u201ctalked to all the right people, said all the right things, then he got into office and spearheaded the Obamacare-Ottercare legislation. \u2026 It was offensive to me that he was campaigning as a conservative, but legislating as a liberal.\u201d\n\nCross notes that Malek doesn\u2019t score well on the \u201cFreedom Index\u201d published by the Idaho Freedom Foundation, a conservative, free-market lobbying group that rates legislation and scores state lawmakers. This year, Malek\u2019s Freedom Index score was minus-32. The top-ranked House member was outspoken conservative freshman Rep. Heather Scott, R-Blanchard, who made waves this summer for posing with a Confederate battle flag at a local parade.\n\n\u201cHe just hasn\u2019t followed along the conservative Republican line,\u201d Cross said.\n\nThe \u2018politics of obedience\u2019\n\nIn addition to the insurance exchange legislation, Malek has championed funding for a mental health crisis center in Kootenai County, which passed overwhelmingly despite opposition from several local GOP lawmakers and will open this year. It was strongly supported by law enforcement and the local business community.\n\nAnd he fought hard against a move to kill child-support enforcement legislation this year after the Freedom Foundation came out against it. The bill had passed the Senate unanimously, but after it stalled in a House committee on the final day of the session, Gov. Butch Otter had to call lawmakers back for a special session in May to pass a new version and keep the state\u2019s child-support enforcement system functioning.\n\n\u201cYou actually saw people change their vote in committee just because they got an email\u201d from the Freedom Foundation, Malek said. He said it highlighted what he calls the \u201cpolitics of obedience,\u201d saying, \u201cIt flies in the face of how people want to be independent. It\u2019s counter to the entire area up here.\u201d\n\nMalek, who serves on the Legislature\u2019s key joint budget committee, sponsored the crisis center funding bill.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a heck of a legislator,\u201d LiCalzi said. \u201cFor someone who hasn\u2019t been there very long, he\u2019s very influential. \u2026 He knows the issues, and people respect him.\u201d\n\nMalek has cast conservative party-line votes, too. He voted with the all-GOP majority in 2014 to allow holders of enhanced permits to carry concealed weapons on Idaho public college campuses. He also joined the all-GOP majority to back criminal penalties for surreptitious videotaping of agricultural operations; the law was subsequently found unconstitutional by a federal court. He backed legislation this year that passed on a party-line vote to impose strict restrictions on medication-induced abortions.\n\nMalek\u2019s wife, Tara, said, \u201cI can\u2019t say that it\u2019s not uncomfortable to watch people rip into him. But we\u2019ve had a lot of conversations about it, and he felt like it was the right thing to do. The day he starts making decisions on what kind of criticism he gets is the day he needs to step out of politics.\u201d\n\nKootenai County Prosecutor Barry McHugh, for whom Malek worked as an intern and then a deputy prosecutor, said, \u201cHe was a really good prosecutor \u2013 he\u2019s very aggressive and hardworking, and I really enjoyed having him in the office.\u201d McHugh added, \u201cLuke is very conservative, and I think he does a great job for Kootenai County.\u201d\n\nMalek said he\u2019s continued speaking at local town meetings \u2013 lots of them, even after that stormy one early in his first term.\n\n\u201cThere were a lot of angry people. I got chewed out quite a bit by different folks,\u201d he recalled. \u201cThere were people determined, thinking we could\u2019ve overturned Obamacare.\u201d But Malek said he believes strongly that that wouldn\u2019t have been the outcome of rejecting the exchange bill.\n\nHe said, \u201cI make myself available, and there\u2019s no group that I won\u2019t talk to, even if I don\u2019t seem aligned with them. They still deserve access to their representatives.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "A popular, well-respected second-term North Idaho lawmaker barely squeaked through the GOP primary against an unknown newcomer.
