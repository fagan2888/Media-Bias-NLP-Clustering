Minneapolis, MN

Artists began work on a giant mural featuring a portrait of Bob Dylan on a building in downtown Minneapolis.



Artists began painting the 60-foot tall, 150-wide portrait of Dylan on Wednesday. The kaleidoscopic portrait will fill a whitewashed wall at the corner of Fifth Street and Hennepin Avenue.



The mural was commissioned by the building's owner, Goldman Sachs, in an effort to help Minneapolis revitalize the area. The $50,000 project is being planned by Brazilian artist Eduardo Kobra, whose murals include one in Miami of rappers Tupac and the Notorious B.I.G.



Kobra says he wants to keep the design a surprise, but says people can watch it in progress. The mural will include lyrics from Dylan's song "The Times They Are A-Changin'."
