Rick Perry\u2019s rejection of Medicaid expansion will force private health insurance premiums to rise by an average of 9.3 percent for Texans buying coverage on their own, a new study finds.\n\nGOP lawmakers, strongly encouraged by Perry, decided not to add poor adults to Medicaid\u2019s rolls and that means about 1.3 million fewer Texans will have health coverage of some sort by 2016 than if the federal health law were fully carried out in the Lone Star State, according to a study by the nonprofit research organization RAND Corp..\n\nAbout 320,000 adult Texans just above the poverty line will take advantage of Obamacare\u2019s federal subsidies and buy coverage in the individual insurance market, the researchers found. Those are people who would have been enrolled in Medicaid, as the federal law was written and before that part of it was altered by a Supreme Court ruling. The RAND experts said that because low-income people generally are not as healthy as people with higher incomes, their inclusion in the private health insurance exchange \u2014 a second big piece of the law \u2014 will alter the claims experience of insurers serving the individual market. Currently, fewer than one in 20 Texans buys in that market, though it\u2019s about to grow dramatically. Including the 320,000 low-income adults will force a 9.3-percent increase in premiums for all 3 million Texans who will be enrolled in the individual market by 2016, the RAND researchers said.\n\n\u201cWhen exchange subsidies become available to lower-income individuals, the average health of the exchange population declines slightly, and premiums increase,\u201d they wrote.\n\nIn Texas, the exchange, or marketplace, opens next month. It will be run by the federal Department of Health and Human Services because Perry in 2011 threatened to veto a Republican House lawmaker\u2019s bill calling for a state-run exchange. In this year\u2019s legislative session, no Republican dared propose a state-run exchange. In 2013, Republicans fought mostly over whether to dicker with the federal department over a \u201cTexas style\u201d alternative to Medicaid expansion that would draw down the tens of billions of federal dollars Texas is forgoing. They ended up not proposing or setting guidelines for such a negotiation. Instead, they required Perry and his appointees, who already have authority to request Medicaid waivers from the feds, to obtain lawmakers\u2019 approval before expanding coverage for poor adults. Perry is showing no signs of backing down, as some GOP governors have done.\n\nDespite Perry\u2019s recalcitrance, the RAND study shows that President Barack Obama\u2019s signature health care legislation will cause more than a tripling of the share of Texas\u2019 non-elderly population that will be enrolled in the individual insurance market in 2016 \u2014 from 2.9 percent, if Obamacare had not been passed, to 11.3 percent. Spurring that increase is the law\u2019s \u201cadvance premium tax credits,\u201d or subsidies that the study says could reach 69 percent of those buying their own coverage. The law also requires that individuals buy coverage, and at least some young healthy people are expected to comply, RAND\u2019s researchers said.\n\nWith Medicaid expansion, the percentage of Texas\u2019 non-elderly population that\u2019s uninsured would drop in 2016 from 28.2 percent to 12.4 percent, they said. Obviously, that won\u2019t happen. Still, the number of uninsured Texans will decline from more than 6 million currently to just over 4.2 million. With full implementation of the Affordable Care Act, the number would have shrunk to 2.9 million. Undocumented immigrants can\u2019t gain coverage under the law, so in states such as Texas and Florida, the uninsured rate will remain high, the researchers found.\n\nWhen premiums are standardized to reflect the law\u2019s enriched health plan benefits and guidelines on how much insurers can charge when they consider things such as age and tobacco use, the average out of pocket premium expenditure will be $2,739 a year for a person in Texas\u2019 individual market in 2016, the study said. That compares with $3,340 the person would be paying if the Affordable Care Act hadn\u2019t been passed. The study projected only a slight gain in enrollment and virtually no change in premiums \u2014 again, after considering the richer benefits and the \u201crate bands\u201d \u2014 in Texas\u2019 small group market, which mostly consists of small businesses. But researchers acknowledged their computer model doesn\u2019t account for the possibility that some companies might make \u201cfundamental changes to their business models, such as reducing the number of full-time workers, to avoid new regulations.\u201d Obamacare critics have predicted a vast shift by employers toward part-time workers, though the evidence so far is mostly anecdotal and Obama has delayed enforcement of rules on them for a year.", "article_metadata": {"liveFyreID": "aHR0cDovL3RyYWlsYmxhemVyc2Jsb2cuZGFsbGFzbmV3cy5jb20vMjAxMy8wOS9zdHVkeS1yZWZ1c2luZy10by1leHBhbmQtbWVkaWNhaWQtd2lsbC1pbmNyZWFzZS1wcml2YXRlLWhlYWx0aC1pbnN1cmFuY2UtcHJlbWl1bXMtYnktOS0zLXBlcmNlbnQtZm9yLTMtbWlsbGlvbi10ZXhhbnMuaHRtbC8=", "generator": "WordPress 3.9.12", "author": "Robert T.
