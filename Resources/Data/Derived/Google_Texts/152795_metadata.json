The point of the lunch was to discuss ways to get young, healthy people to sign up for health insurance through Healthcare.gov.\n\nHere\u2019s how Washington, D.C., pop radio DJ Tommy McFly interpreted his role at the lunch, as he said it on his show last week (emphasis added):\n\n\u201cWhat was interesting, [Obama] just said, you know, they want people who are younger just to know that it\u2019s there. That Healthcare.gov is there. Go to it, check it out. If you like it, great. Whatever. You know, he just wants the message to be out there. Which I think is admirable because he could have been like: Here\u2019s five ways to talk about it. But he didn\u2019t.\n\nThat sounds really chill of the President. Indifferent, almost.\n\nThough, in reality, young people without insurance who decide \u201cwhatever\u201d after checking out the website and don\u2019t sign up for a policy\u2013 they\u2019ll face a penalty of up to $95.\n\nAlso, the law depends on young, healthy people to sign up for policies as a way to subsidize older, less healthier people.\n\nWe\u2019ve requested comment from McFly on whether Obama actually sounded that unconcerned.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30; polling-uri=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/1.xml; polling-uri2=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/2.xml; polling-uri3=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/3.xml; polling-uri4=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/4.xml", "application-name": "TheBlaze.com", "twitter": {"description": "Recall that last week President Obama had lunch with six young people, all but one of which were outright supporters of Obamacare.
