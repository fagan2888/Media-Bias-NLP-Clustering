Today, about 3,000 Tibetans live in Majnu Ka Tilla.\n\nTibetan restaurants, guesthouses, street food vendors and craft stands line the narrow streets, which are clogged with rickshaws, beggars, stray dogs and women carrying impossible loads on the tops of their heads.\n\nIt is the typical chaos of the Indian street. But in this section of India\u2019s capital, walls are covered in \u201cFree Tibet\u201d graffiti and posters of the Dalai Lama. There is a Buddhist temple in the center of Majnu Ka Tilla, out front of which hangs a large poster with a tally of the number of days a trio of Tibetan activists has been on a hunger strike.\n\n\u201cYou can walk around here and there are so many stories of people who gave up everything to come to India,\u201d said Lopsang Sherap, 35, a guesthouse manager in Majnu Ka Tilla. \u201cThat tells you how bad it is in Tibet.\u201d\n\nSherap\u2019s parents crossed the Himalayas in 1959 to escape Tibet\u2014the same year the Dalai Lama went into exile. Sherap was born in India, but he is not an Indian citizen. He does not have a passport and is essentially stateless, forbidden from returning to what he calls his \u201cmotherland.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s impossible for me to go to Tibet,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019d never let in a Tibetan who was born in India. But if Tibet were free? Yes, of course I\u2019d go back. And so would my parents.\u201d\n\nCultural Genocide\n\nIn his 1957 book, \u201cSeven Years in Tibet,\u201d Austrian mountaineer Heinrich Harrer wrote about his adventures in what he called the \u201cForbidden Land\u201d\u2014a reference to Tibet\u2019s near total ban on foreign visitors prior to the 1950 Chinese invasion.\n\n\u201cThe foreigners whom I met during the five years of my stay in Lhasa were not more than seven in number,\u201d Harrer wrote, referring to his time in the Tibetan capital.\n\nTibet is no longer off-limits to outsiders. Chinese government sources say that 15 million tourists visited the Tibet Autonomous Region (TAR) in 2014. Yet, 65 years after the Communist Chinese invasion Tibet is still a forbidden land. But for an entirely different reason: Tibet is now a prison for the Tibetans living there.\n\n\u201cTibetans are stuck in China, they can\u2019t even travel outside their own villages,\u201d said Karma Rinchen, additional secretary for the Tibetan government in exile\u2019s Department of Security, during an interview with The Daily Signal in Dharamshala, India.\n\n\u201cA villager needs at least five permits to travel to Lhasa,\u201d Rinchen added. \u201cThe government completely regulates the movement of Tibetans within Tibet. It\u2019s kind of insane, actually.\u201d\n\nWithin the 474,000 square miles of the TAR, Tibetans live in an Orwellesque condition of constant government overwatch and restricted movement. Tibetans are subject to arbitrary imprisonment and torture. Their sovereign culture, religion, history, and language are being systematically and deliberately erased in what the Dalai Lama has called a \u201ccultural genocide\u201d at the hands of China\u2019s Communist party.\n\n\u201cSome kind of cultural genocide is taking place,\u201d the Dalai Lama said in November 2011, addressing a string of self-immolations by Tibetans inside China. \u201cThat\u2019s why, you see, these sorts of sad incidents happen, due to the desperateness of the situation,\u201d he added.\n\nSince 2009, 141 Tibetans have self-immolated in Tibet, 122 of whom died immediately or shortly thereafter, according to officials in Dharamshala.\n\nAccording to a Tibetan Center for Human Rights and Democracy report on human rights in Tibet: \u201cThe self-immolations should be regarded as an indicator of the continuing deterioration of conditions inside Tibet: the lack of religious freedom, the prevalence of arbitrary detention and torture, and Tibetans\u2019 unequal access to development.\u201d\n\nIn 2008, protests against Chinese rule swept across Tibet in advance of the Beijing Olympics. Chinese authorities, who blamed the Dalai Lama for the protests, reacted with a crackdown on Tibetans\u2019 freedoms and an increase in government surveillance to stamp out any vestiges of resistance. In the Tibetan capital of Lhasa, according to interviews with Tibetan refugees, Chinese police now randomly confiscate Tibetans\u2019 cell phones. Being caught with a photo of the Dalai Lama or of the Tibetan flag are grounds for arrest.\n\n\u201cOut of 100 Tibetans who flee from Tibet to India, 99 come here to learn our culture and our language,\u201d said Sonam Tsering, 30, owner of the Nechung Caf\u00e9 just outside the Tibetan Library in Dharamshala. \u201cWe had to speak Chinese in school, and it was forbidden to have pictures of His Holiness in our homes. Tibetan culture is dying in Tibet\u2014our philosophy, our religion, our language, everything.\u201d\n\nTsering fled Tibet when he was 9 years old, crossing the Himalayas in a 23-day journey from Tibet to Nepal in 1994. Tsering went alone, leaving his family behind for a new life in India. Now 30 years old, Tsering hasn\u2019t seen his family in 21 years.\n\n\u201cAlways we have hope that Tibet will be free one day,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we the people follow His Holiness 100 percent, then we will get Tibet back.\u201d\n\nStuck in Limbo\n\nThe Sonamling Tibetan refugee settlement in Choglamsar is located on the Indus River a few miles outside the northern Indian city of Leh, capital of India\u2019s arid Himalayan Ladakh region.\n\nThere is no horizon here. Only a surrounding stadium of barren Himalayan peaks, colored in earth tones that sharply contrast against the deep blue sky. At an elevation of 11,500 feet, the air is thin, crisp and cool. But the sun, with less atmosphere to filter it, is baking hot. One can go from shivering to sweating just by stepping out of the shade.\n\nBuddhist monks in their maroon robes wander the dusty streets, which are crowded with Royal Enfield motorcycles, cows and shared taxis. Restaurants serve tsampa and butter tea. Walls of prayer wheels line the roads, which passers-by spin while chanting the Buddhist, \u201cOm mani padme hum,\u201d mantra.\n\nScattered throughout India and Nepal, Tibetan refugee colonies like Sonamling have become time capsules of Tibetan culture prior to the 1950 Chinese invasion.\n\n\u201cI went back to Tibet in 1991 for two months,\u201d Topgyal Tsering, 47, said during an interview at the Tibetan government in exile\u2019s offices in Sonamling. \u201cThere were many changes. Tibetan culture was disappearing very fast. There were no more yaks, and no more dzos plowing the fields. People no longer wear the traditional clothes, and in some places it is forbidden to speak the Tibetan language.\u201d\n\nThe need to preserve their culture, coupled with an unshakeable belief that Tibet will one day regain its independence, has left the Tibetan refugee community in limbo. \u201cTibetans can\u2019t integrate into India because if they do, their culture will disappear,\u201d Tsering said.\n\nTsering fled Tibet across the Himalayas into Nepal with his family when he was nine. He still has family in Tibet, whom he calls regularly. \u201cWe don\u2019t talk about politics,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are afraid of talking about such things on the phone.\u201d\n\nWith China stamping out Tibetan culture within Tibet, Tsering said refugee communities have a special responsibility to preserve their exiled nation\u2019s culture, religion and language.\n\n\u201cOur culture is disappearing, and not just because of what the Chinese have done,\u201d Tsering said. \u201cYoung Tibetan refugees want to be more Westernized and it\u2019s hard to remember their roots. It takes a community to preserve a culture.\u201d\n\nSpeaking in Majnu Ka Tilla, Sherap said: \u201cI was born in India, but I am Tibetan first. When my parents\u2019 generation passes, however, there won\u2019t be anyone left to remember Tibet as it once was.\u201d\n\nFamily Ties\n\nInside almost every shop, guesthouse and restaurant in Majnu Ka Tilla is a shrine to the Dalai Lama, usually draped in Khata scarves and fronted with offerings of food. Shrines to the Dalai Lama, ubiquitous within Tibetan refugee colonies across India and Nepal, are illegal inside Tibet; a fact which Tibetan refugees frequently mention when they explain the oppressive conditions that spurred them to flee their homeland.\n\nTsundue (who asked not to have his last name used due to security concerns regarding his family in Tibet) has a shrine to the Dalai Lama over the checkout counter in the Tibetan craft shop he runs in Majnu Ka Tilla. Since the 2008 uprisings it has been too dangerous for Tsundue to talk directly with his mother who lives in Tibet, so he relays messages to her through his brother, who is a monk in the eastern Kham region of Tibet. The Dalai Lama, however, is never mentioned, knowing that those two words would trigger the interest of Chinese authorities likely eavesdropping on the conversation. \u201cMy mom told them (the Chinese) I was dead, so the issue is closed,\u201d Tsundue said. \u201cBut we have to be careful.\u201d\n\nTsundue was 10 years old when he and his uncle escaped Tibet by crossing the Himalayas into Nepal near Mt. Everest. He was in a group of 30, which included two children.\n\n\u201cI was only 10, but I can remember being very scared,\u201d Tsundue, who is now 25 years old, said during an interview at his shop in Majnu Ka Tilla. His manner of speaking and appearance were Western. He wore jeans and a T-shirt, and had a faint moustache and a hipster haircut\u2014long on top and shaved on the sides. He smiled a lot as he spoke fluently in English.\n\n\u201cWe crossed the Himalayas in winter,\u201d he continued. \u201cWe had to travel at night because the Chinese soldiers were out there and they would shoot us if they caught us. My uncle held my hand as we walked. I was practically asleep and frozen so he had to pull me along.\u201d\n\nAt the beginning of the journey, after four days concealed in the bed of a truck, Tsundue\u2019s group had to cross a frozen river. The refugees walked across gingerly, he explained, carrying their loads (comprising all of their possessions crammed into one backpack) on top of their heads. Yards from reaching the opposite shore, Tsundue fell through the ice. His uncle grabbed him and yanked him out of the water before he slipped under the frozen sheet.\n\n\u201cAfter that my legs were wet, and as we hiked through the mountains my pant legs froze as hard as wood,\u201d Tsundue said. \u201cIt sucked.\u201d\n\nTsundue and his uncle couldn\u2019t afford to buy sunglasses to protect from snow blindness, which was a constant worry due to the blinding reflection of the high-altitude sun off the winter blanket of snow. As a substitute, they cut strips of black trash bags and tied them around their heads. \u201cWe met merchants who offered to sell us sunglasses,\u201d Tsundue said. \u201cBut they were charging 700 rupees. Way too expensive.\u201d\n\nTsundue\u2019s group took a route across the Himalayas into Nepal. Without mountaineering clothing or equipment, or enough food, they traversed some of the same glaciers and mountain terrain Sir Edmund Hillary described exploring in his 1955 book, \u201cHigh Adventure.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe stopped aghast at the view ahead,\u201d Hillary wrote, describing the area. \u201cIt was far worse than I had expected. In front of us a great icefall tumbled down thousands of feet in an utter chaos of shattered ice. The icefall was split by a great rock buttress, and the ice surged around it like the bow-wave of a destroyer.\u201d\n\nChinese and Nepali border guard units now patrol the same Himalayan frontier where Hillary explored. For Tibetan refugees trying to slip through the dragnet, their goal is the U.N.-run refugee reception center in Kathmandu, which promises freedom and a path to refugee communities in India. But just getting to Kathmandu isn\u2019t enough. Tibetan refugees know they aren\u2019t safe until they make it through the reception center\u2019s doorway.\n\n\u201cWe had to wear Nepali clothes and try to pretend we were from Nepal,\u201d Tsundue said. \u201cBut only four of us were not put in jail when we arrived.\u201d\n\nTsundue said his parents sent him to Tibet to escape the corrupting influence of Communist Chinese culture. He said Lhasa, once home to the Dalai Lama, is now teeming with brothels and cheap alcohol. \u201cThe Chinese want to destroy Tibetans as a race,\u201d he said. \u201cMoms worry, you know. So my mom wanted to get me out of Tibet. She told my uncle to get me out.\u201d\n\nExcept for his uncle, who is now a monk living in Nepal, Tsundue\u2019s entire family still lives in Tibet. He hasn\u2019t seen any of them in 15 years. When Chinese police started asking questions about her son\u2019s whereabouts, Tsundue\u2019s mother said he had died.\n\n\u201cAfter I arrived in India it was seven years before I could talk to my mom,\u201d Tsundue said. \u201cAfter all that time she sent me a letter and put a photo of her in it. I didn\u2019t recognize her. I had forgotten what she looked like.\u201d\n\nIn addition to his brother, Tsundue has a 15-year-old sister he has never met. His mother was pregnant with her when he left Tibet in 2000.\n\n\u201cI am alone and don\u2019t have any family here,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a very hard life.\u201d\n\nWhen Tsundue was finally able to start calling home, he noticed that his father was never available to talk. His mother kept saying that he was away on a trip or at the monastery each time he called. \u201cAfter a while I suspected something was wrong,\u201d Tsundue said. \u201cWhen she finally told me he was dead, I said, \u2018Mom, I knew for a long time that something had happened to dad.\u2019 She was trying to protect me, I think.\u201d\n\nTsundue recently watched a bootleg copy of the 2014 movie \u201cUnbroken\u201d at a friend\u2019s apartment. The movie was about U.S. Olympic runner Louis Zamperini, who survived a plane crash in the Pacific in World War II and endured more than two years in a Japanese prisoner of war camp. The story resonated with the 25-year-old Tibetan refugee.\n\n\u201cI still have hope for Tibet\u2019s freedom,\u201d Tsundue said. \u201cI still believe that one day I will go back home and see my family again.\u201d\n\nApart at the Seams\n\nHuman rights conditions in the TAR have consistently worsened since 2008, but they are an unequally shared burden. Han Chinese living in the TAR are not subject to the same government surveillance and restrictions on movement under which Tibetans live, creating a state of apartheid inside Tibet.\n\nThe requirement for Tibetans to obtain five travel permits to travel within the TAR, for example, does not apply to Han Chinese, according to officials in Dharamshala.\n\n\u201cThere are definite tensions between the Han Chinese and Tibetans inside the TAR,\u201d said Sherab Woeser, visiting fellow at the Dharamshala-based Tibet Policy Institute think tank. \u201cThey live in different communities in the same town. They are like disconnected parts.\u201d\n\nThe 2008 protests evidenced the simmering ethnic tensions within Tibet. Protesters targeted Chinese-owned shops in Lhasa and, according to Western and Chinese news reports, Tibetan rioters also attacked Han Chinese civilians.\n\n\u201cTibetans, as a people, have been completely marginalized inside China,\u201d Woeser added. \u201cAnd their resentment is starting to come out.\u201d\n\nMonks caught with pictures of the Dalai Lama or Tibetan flags are forced to undergo \u201cpatriotic education,\u201d or are arrested and tortured. In 1994, China banned photos of the Dalai Lama in Tibetan monasteries. Today that ban extends to all Tibetan homes and even includes smartphones. Being labeled a \u201csplittist\u201d is grounds for imprisonment. Sometimes those who are arrested disappear with no explanation for years. Occasionally, inmates die within days of release due to injuries suffered during torture.\n\n\u201cThe final solution to China\u2019s Tibetan problem is for Tibet\u2019s culture and religion to no longer exist,\u201d Woeser said.\n\nIn addition to deliberate government repression, some claim growing metrics of inequality are also fueling ethnic tensions. According to Chinese census data, Tibetans living within the TAR are less educated, live shorter lives and make less money than those in other regions of China.\n\nOver the past 30 years, the TAR has had the lowest life expectancy in China among all of China\u2019s regions\u201466.33 years in 2010.\n\nThe TAR also has the highest rate of infant mortality among all of China\u2019s regions. About one quarter (23.5 percent) of all babies born in the TAR die between six weeks of pregnancy and up to one week after birth. This is about three times the national Chinese average of 8.6 percent.\n\nTibet\u2019s illiteracy rate is also the highest in China. The rate has declined significantly since 1990, but at 24.4 percent in 2010, illiteracy in the TAR is still six times the national Chinese average of 4 percent.\n\n\u201cMany parents send their children over here because they know they will have a better life out of Tibet,\u201d Tsering said, speaking at the caf\u00e9 he owns in Dharamshala.\n\nNo Escape\n\nEscaping Tibet has always been perilous. The Dalai Lama required an armed escort of Chushi-Gangdruk Tibetan guerilla fighters for protection when he fled in 1959. Forty-seven years later, in September 2006, Chinese border police shot dead a 17-year-old Tibetan nun, Kelsang Namtso, while she was crossing the Nangpa Pass into Nepal with a group of Tibetan refugees. She was only 20 minutes from the Nepali border. A Romanian mountaineer who was part of a climbing expedition on nearby Cho Oyu filmed the shooting.\n\nSince 2008, increased Chinese border security as well as Chinese support and training for Nepalese border patrols (a key route for Tibetan refugees is through the Himalayas into Nepal) have made it even harder for Tibetans to escape.\n\n\u201cNow there\u2019s no way to get out, they\u2019re completely intolerant to Tibetans crossing the border,\u201d Rinchen said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not just about closing the border, China has also been taking back Tibetans\u2019 passports.\u201d\n\nAccording to Tibetan government in exile officials, after 2008 the number of Tibetan refugees decreased from about 2,000 to 3,000 a year prior to about 300 or 400.\n\n\u201cThe border between India and China is almost completely sealed,\u201d Rinchen said. \u201cIt\u2019s almost impossible to get out. China is spending a lot of money to guard this border and keep Tibetans from fleeing. This is telling. People don\u2019t risk their lives to escape a country where they are happy and have a good life.\u201d\n\nRinchen is second in command of the Tibetan government in exile\u2019s Department of Security. The department has a broad set of responsibilities and is equivalent to a fusion of the CIA, Secret Service and FBI for the exiled Tibetan government. Approximately 100 staffers and agents working for the department assist the Indian government with providing security for the Dalai Lama. They also hunt for Chinese spies in Dharamshala, defend Tibetan government computers against Chinese cyberattacks (which are frequent) and debrief recently escaped Tibetan refugees about conditions inside Tibet.\n\nRinchen said the security department\u2019s debriefings of refugees paint a picture of pervasive human rights violations inside Tibet, as well as simmering resentment against Chinese rule that has not abated or diminished after 65 years.\n\nHe also admitted that due to China\u2019s tight control of information flowing out of Tibet, interviewing refugees is still the most reliable way to learn about conditions on the ground. Although, he admitted that the rise of social media has helped shed more light on human rights violations, as has the work of some Tibetan bloggers who take enormous risks to relay information.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s still very difficult to get information,\u201d Rinchen said. \u201cIt\u2019s a tough job and we don\u2019t have many resources. And we don\u2019t encourage sources inside Tibet to take risks.\u201d\n\nRinchen said the information the Department of Security collects is used to brief government in exile lawmakers and to generate reports for foreign governments and international bodies.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t about military intelligence,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s about documenting human rights abuses.\u201d\n\nDetoxing the Mind\n\n\u201cWhen we got to India,\u201d Choegyal Phuntsok said, \u201cI understood why we left.\u201d\n\nPhuntsok, 25, owns a craft shop on Temple Road in Dharamshala, selling yak bone prayer beads and bracelets embroidered with \u201cFree Tibet.\u201d\n\nHe was 10 years old in 2005 when he escaped Tibet into Nepal, crossing the Himalayas in a group of 23, including his mother, father, 4-year-old brother and 3-year-old sister.\n\nWhile explaining his escape from Tibet, Phuntsok echoed the same harrowing details as many other refugees. His group would only travel at night, he said, out of fear of Chinese soldiers patrolling the Himalayan border.\n\n\u201cIf the Chinese caught us, they would kill us,\u201d he said with a casual laugh. \u201cDuring the day we would hide in caves. For one whole month we would only move at night.\u201d\n\nEach day, while others slept, a man in the group wearing camouflage to blend into the mountain terrain would volunteer to scout ahead to find that night\u2019s route. The scouting duties rotated among six men, including Phuntsok\u2019s father.\n\nPhuntsok said the route across the Himalayas was extremely dangerous. His group had to endure extreme cold, the physiological consequences of the high-altitude and the perils of traveling across glaciers and steep mountain terrain. As well as armed Chinese and Nepali soldiers patrolling the area.\n\n\u201cWe saw several dead bodies along the way,\u201d Phuntsok said.\n\nPhuntsok\u2019s parents decided to take their children on this dangerous journey so that they could have an education free from the \u201cbrainwashing\u201d of Communist China.\n\nIn Tibet the Chinese are systematically eradicating all vestiges of traditional Tibetan culture and language, Phuntsok said. In Chinese school, Tibetan students were taught in Mandarin, even though it wasn\u2019t their native language. And Chinese teachers promoted a skewed version of history, claiming Tibet was never an independent country and that the 1950 Chinese invasion was actually a \u201cliberation\u201d of Tibet from Western imperialists.\n\n(As Harrer wrote in \u201cSeven Years in Tibet,\u201d there were about a half-dozen foreigners living in Tibet at the time China \u201cliberated\u201d it)\n\nPhuntsok compared his first few years living in Dharamshala, India, among Tibetan refugees to \u201cdetoxing\u201d his mind from Communist Chinese propaganda.\n\n\u201cTibetans know that if they come to India they will be able to get an education and learn about Tibetan culture,\u201d Phuntsok said. \u201cIn Tibet we weren\u2019t allowed to learn about Tibetan or even speak in Tibetan. We weren\u2019t even allowed to have a picture of the Dalai Lama in our home. Being Tibetan is a crime in China.\u201d\n\n\u201cNow, when I realize what happened to my country, I get angry,\u201d Phuntsok added.\n\nDespite having grown up and received his education in India, the 25-year-old refugee said he feels like his life in India is transitory and impermanent. If Tibet became free he would go back \u201cin a heartbeat.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m always hoping that my life, my career, and one day, when I have a family\u2014it will all be in Tibet,\u201d he said. \u201cI believe that one day Tibetans will get our freedom, and we will see Tibet again.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Majnu Ka Tilla Tibetan refugee colony was founded in the 1960s to consolidate Tibetan refugee communities around India\u2019s capital into one location.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The Majnu Ka Tilla Tibetan refugee colony was founded in the 1960s to consolidate Tibetan refugee communities around India\u2019s capital into one location.", "title": "Tibet: The Forgotten Refugee Crisis", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/151020_Refugees.jpg", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1RUo8xJ"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The Majnu Ka Tilla Tibetan refugee colony was founded in the 1960s to consolidate Tibetan refugee communities around India\u2019s capital into one location.", "title": "Tibet: The Forgotten Refugee Crisis", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/151020_Refugees.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "International", "tag": "Asia,conflict", "published_time": "2015-10-23T15:41:38+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "China, Tibet, Dalai Lama, refugees"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd4181\"", "article_summary": "In the Tibetan capital of Lhasa, according to interviews with Tibetan refugees, Chinese police now randomly confiscate Tibetans\u2019 cell phones.\nThe refugee colony was founded in the 1960s to consolidate Tibetan refugee communities around India\u2019s capital into one location.\nFor Tibetan refugees trying to slip through the dragnet, their goal is the U.N.-run refugee reception center in Kathmandu, which promises freedom and a path to refugee communities in India.\nScattered throughout India and Nepal, Tibetan refugee colonies like Sonamling have become time capsules of Tibetan culture prior to the 1950 Chinese invasion.\nApproximately 100 staffers and agents working for the department assist the Indian government with providing security for the Dalai Lama."}
