It’s been quite a week in the world of news. Here are five charts that put the week’s happenings into perspective:

1. Another data dump from the so-called Panama Papers, which are records of offshore accounts managed by a Panama law firm, ensnared actress Emma Watson. "Emma receives absolutely no tax or monetary advantages from this offshore company whatsoever — only privacy,” said a statement from her representatives.

2. Paul Ryan and Donald Trump pledged Thursday to work together to defeat Democrat Hillary Clinton in the fall general election — though the Republican House speaker again stopped short of formally endorsing his party's presumptive presidential nominee.

3. Republicans won the first round Thursday in a separation of powers battle against President Obama that once again focuses on his most prized achievement: Obamacare. Federal district Judge Rosemary Collyer, a Republican appointee, ruled that the law did not provide for the funds insurers need to make health insurance policies under the program affordable.

4. The battle over transgender rights expanded dramatically Monday when North Carolina and the federal government sued each other over a new state law that requires people to use the restroom that corresponds with their gender at birth.

5. For the second time in 19 years, Office-supply giants Staples and Office Depot called off their $6.3-billion merger after federal regulators raised antitrust concerns. This time, the end came after a federal judge in Washington, D.C., issued a Tuesday injunction to halt the merger, acting on objections raised by the Federal Trade Commission.
