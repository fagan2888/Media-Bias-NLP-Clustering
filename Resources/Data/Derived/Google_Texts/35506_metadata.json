At 11 years old, she has already yanked out her own loose tooth using a slingbow.\n\nIn order to get it done, Alexis attached a string to her loose tooth, which was tied to an arrow on the slingbow. Poised like a warrior princess with a big grin on her face, she lets the arrow go with barely a look of shock or pain \u2014 all while her parents are standing on either side of her and filming her. After the tooth flies out behind the arrow, she raises her arms in triumph and dances, apparently not feeling any pain \u2014 or perhaps too brave to care.\n\n\u201cFearless Alexis appears to feel no pain as she jumps up and down in elation in her backyard in Aurora, Colorado,\u201d Caters TV writes on YouTube.\n\nWhile Alexis\u2019s feat is extraordinary, it\u2019s not always the best idea to try this at home. Most loose teeth and baby teeth require patience and fall out best on their own, when they\u2019re ready to. Pulling out teeth before they\u2019re ready can result in damage to the gums for weeks afterwards \u2014 and involves a lot of bleeding and pain. Some dentists even agree that allowing baby teeth to fall out on their own is essential for your adult teeth to develop properly.\n\nAnd if it\u2019s quite loose and ready to come out \u2014 you don\u2019t always need a slingbow to do it at home. Sometimes even just wiggling the tooth, eating and chewing, or simply waiting will do the trick with a lot less pain.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "tooth, extraction, watch, 11, year, old, girl, use, slingbow, pull, out, her, own, tooth", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "This girl is a fearless warrior who isn\u2019t afraid to take matters into her own hands.", "title": "Girl Uses Slingbow To Pull Out Her Own Tooth [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/tooth-extraction-watch-11-year-old-girl-use-slingbow-pull-out-her-own-tooth-341328", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured_video/public/2015/07/06/tooth-extraction-watch-11-year-old-girl-use-slingbow-pull-out-her-own-tooth.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "This girl is a fearless warrior who isn\u2019t afraid to take matters into her own hands.", "title": "Girl Uses Slingbow To Pull Out Her Own Tooth [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/tooth-extraction-watch-11-year-old-girl-use-slingbow-pull-out-her-own-tooth-341328", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured_video/public/2015/07/06/tooth-extraction-watch-11-year-old-girl-use-slingbow-pull-out-her-own-tooth.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/07/06/tooth-extraction-watch-11-year-old-girl-use-slingbow-pull-out-her-own-tooth.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2015-07-06T11:13:00-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-07-06T11:40:49-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "This girl is a fearless warrior who isn\u2019t afraid to take matters into her own hands."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc013\"", "article_summary": "At 11 years old, she has already yanked out her own loose tooth using a slingbow.\nMost loose teeth and baby teeth require patience and fall out best on their own, when they\u2019re ready to.\nSome dentists even agree that allowing baby teeth to fall out on their own is essential for your adult teeth to develop properly.\nIn order to get it done, Alexis attached a string to her loose tooth, which was tied to an arrow on the slingbow.\nAnd if it\u2019s quite loose and ready to come out \u2014 you don\u2019t always need a slingbow to do it at home."}
