Burwell, outraged that six justices considered legislative intent, legislative history, and context. \u201c[The six-member majority] rewrites the law to make tax credits available everywhere,\u201d Scalia complained. \u201cWe should start calling this law SCOTUScare,\u201d\n\nSoon after, as the Washington Post reported , a House Republican announced new legislation to force the high court\u2019s justices to use the Affordable Care Act. It\u2019s called the \u201cSCOTUScare Act of 2015.\u201d\n\nRep. Brian Babin (R-Texas) introduced a bill, piggy-backing off Justice Antonin Scalia\u2019s sarcasm, that would require all the justices and their clerks to get their health coverage through an Obamacare program as members of Congress and their staffs already do. \u201cBy eliminating their exemption from Obamacare, they will see firsthand what the American people are forced to live with!\u201d Babin said in a statement.\n\nWhat Babin doesn\u2019t like about the ACA is not altogether clear. (If his name sounds at all familiar, the far-right Texan, less than a month into his first term in Congress, announced his belief that President Obama, without a doubt, \u201c deserves impeachment .\u201d)\n\nFor what it\u2019s worth, the Republican freshman wasn\u2019t just blowing smoke \u2013 he actually introduced this bill yesterday. The proposal picked up a bill number ( H.R.2905 ), and was quickly endorsed by two co-sponsors: Rep. John Ratcliffe (R-Texas) and Rep. Jim Bridenstine (R-Okla.).\n\nIt\u2019s too soon to say whether the bill will gain any real traction, but either way, there\u2019s something oddly perfect about the proposal.\n\nTo a very real extent, the \u201cScotuscare Act\u201d is emblematic of a broader point, which has been widely underappreciated: congressional Republicans haven\u2019t been prepared to respond to a court ruling in a serious, constructive way \u2013 and they sill aren\u2019t. GOP lawmakers like, want, and propose gimmicks, not policy solutions. They see value in bumper-stickers that take legislative form.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "description": "A House Republican's \"Scotuscare Act\" is oddly emblematic of the party's reluctance to govern effectively and seriously.", "original-source": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/lawmaker-proposes-scotuscare-measure", "og": {"site_name": "MSNBC", "description": "A House Republican's \"Scotuscare Act\" is oddly emblematic of the party's reluctance to govern effectively and seriously.", "title": "Lawmaker proposes 'SCOTUScare' measure", "url": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/lawmaker-proposes-scotuscare-measure", "image": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--1_91-1--1200x630/public/120627-usscj-hmed-923p.jpg?itok=EEKlnNhN", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "msnbc.com", "account_id": 2836421, "title": "Lawmaker proposes 'SCOTUScare' measure", "url": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/lawmaker-proposes-scotuscare-measure", "image": {"width": 830, "identifier": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--3-2--512x342/public/120627-usscj-hmed-923p.jpg?itok=EMJmVdD5", "height": 553}, "creator": {"identifier": "@msnbc", "id": 2836421}, "site": {"identifier": "@msnbc", "id": 2836421}, "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "A House Republican's \"Scotuscare Act\" is oddly emblematic of the party's reluctance to govern effectively and seriously."}, "robots": "follow, index", "DC.date.issued": "2015-06-26T09:23:42-04:00", "jenga-session-config": "{\"when_to_init\":\"after_dom_ready\"}", "fb": {"app_id": 351594351545594}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/steve.benen"}, "abstract": "A House Republican's \"Scotuscare Act\" is oddly emblematic of the party's reluctance to govern effectively and seriously.", "nv": {"tags": "health-care,republicans,supreme-court,rachel-maddow-show", "author": "steve-benen", "published": 1, "date": "06/26/2015 09:23:42 EDT", "title": "Lawmaker proposes 'SCOTUScare' measure", "address": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/lawmaker-proposes-scotuscare-measure"}, "news_keywords": "Republicans, Health Care, Supreme Court"}, "article_summary": "Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia threw a bit of a tantrum yesterday in King v.
