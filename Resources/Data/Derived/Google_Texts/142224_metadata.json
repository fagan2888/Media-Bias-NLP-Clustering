Failure by a GOP-controlled Congress to pass one would be a major embarrassment for Speaker Paul Ryan (WI) and his leadership team.\n\nRyan has repeatedly called for a return to \u201cregular order\u201d that begins with the passage of a budget before taking up any spending bills on the floor.\n\nA failure would also signal even tougher intraparty fights in the months ahead. The budget process stalled because intractable fiscal hawks, led by the rebellious House Freedom Caucus, want to cut federal spending by at least $30 billion while more mainstream lawmakers want to stick to last year\u2019s bipartisan budget deal.\n\nThat split will remain long after the April 15 deadline and likely would emerge again as lawmakers work through the 12 annual spending bills that fund the federal government.\n\nRelated: Why the GOP\u2019s Budget Plans Are Going Off the Rails\n\nThe House and Senate could still pass a budget after that date if they can reach an agreement, but it\u2019s clear that the upper chamber\u2019s Budget Committee hasn\u2019t even taken up a budget resolution of its own and is tired of waiting.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve already announced and I\u2019ll announce again today we\u2019re going to move to appropriations next week,\u201d Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) said Tuesday during a Capitol Hill press conference. \u201cAnd we\u2019ll mark these bills to the topline that we agreed to in the agreement last year.\u201d\n\nHe said the chamber could vote on what is expected to be a roughly $40 billion energy and water development bill as soon as next week.\n\n\u201cI feel pretty good about the appropriations process,\u201d Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV) told reporters. \u201cThe allocations that have been set are fair, they\u2019re not as robust as I would like them, they\u2019re fair and we\u2019ve been told that there will not be any poison pill riders,\u201d he added. \u201cIf there are, we\u2019ll take care of that,\u201d Reid said, suggesting Senate Democrats could hold up the spending legislation and further complicate the calendar.\n\nThe House isn\u2019t resting on its laurels, either.\n\nRelated: Why There\u2019s Trouble Ahead for Paul Ryan\u2019s Trillion-Dollar Budget\n\nThe House Appropriations Committee this week will move forward with individual 2017 spending bills even though they might never receive a floor vote. The full appropriations committee is slated to vote on an $81.6 billion measure to fund military construction and Veterans Affairs Department.\n\nMeanwhile, two of the committee\u2019s subpanels overseeing the Energy and Agriculture departments unveiled their respective $37.4 billion and $21.3 billion funding measures. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) is reveling in the GOP\u2019s dysfunction, putting out a statement chastising the \u201cDo-Nothing Republican Congress.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s possible that Ryan and his team could convince enough of his members to vote for the fiscal scheme the House Budget Committee okayed. However, the significant impasse that exists among House Republicans and the short calendar likely doom the Wisconsin lawmaker\u2019s hopes in a presidential election year to the wood chipper.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "It\u2019s looking more and more like House Republicans are going to blow the deadline to pass a budget.", "title": "Paul Ryan Faces Fiscal Failure as the House Blows the Budget Deadline", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/04/13/Paul-Ryan-Faces-Fiscal-Failure-House-Blows-Budget-Deadline", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/usa-politics-ryan_2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/04/13/Paul-Ryan-Faces-Fiscal-Failure-House-Blows-Budget-Deadline", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/usa-politics-ryan_2.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "It\u2019s looking more and more like House Republicans are going to blow the deadline to pass a budget.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "It\u2019s looking more and more like House Republicans are going to blow the deadline to pass a budget.\nRyan has repeatedly called for a return to \u201cregular order\u201d that begins with the passage of a budget before taking up any spending bills on the floor.\nHouse Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) is reveling in the GOP\u2019s dysfunction, putting out a statement chastising the \u201cDo-Nothing Republican Congress.\u201dIt\u2019s possible that Ryan and his team could convince enough of his members to vote for the fiscal scheme the House Budget Committee okayed.\nFailure by a GOP-controlled Congress to pass one would be a major embarrassment for Speaker Paul Ryan (WI) and his leadership team.\nRelated: The GOP Budget Is on Life Support, and Paul Ryan Knows ItWhile a budget isn\u2019t technically required by law, it does serve as a fiscal framework that spells out the majority\u2019s spending priorities."}
