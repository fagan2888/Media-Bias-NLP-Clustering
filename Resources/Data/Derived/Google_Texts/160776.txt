The Money Hunt is a series about fundraising.

When it comes to their limited partners, many private equity firms think bigger is better.

But Pfingsten Partners has found there is a lot to love about smaller investors, particularly wealthy individuals.

The Chicago-based lower midmarket buyout shop has raised about 43% of the capital for its fifth midmarket fund, which is poised to soon close with $382 million, from wealthy individuals and family offices, said Tom Bagley, the firm’s founder and senior managing director.

That is a jump, even in absolute terms, from the roughly 15% of the $525 million that the firm raised from wealthy individuals and families for its previous offering in 2008.

As Mr. Bagley told LBO Wire this week, wealthy families and individuals tend to take have a good understanding of how to expand a company as many of them earned their wealth from creating their own companies.

“Ninety percent of what we buy comes from entrepreneurs, and family offices can relate to the things we need to do to build better businesses,” said Mr. Bagley, adding wealthy individuals and family offices tend to be patient investors.

“They understand the need to let those companies gestate to create the returns,” he said.

That is important for a firm such as Pfingsten, which tends to raise a new fund every five years to seven years, or even longer, rather than the three or four years common to many private equity firms.

Mr. Bagley said the firm also, on occasion, has tapped its wealthy investor base for due diligence insight on prospective investment targets or to access to their personal and professional networks to help existing portfolio companies.

“We get transaction flow from them and recommendations for operating executives that could end up on our executive network,” he said.
