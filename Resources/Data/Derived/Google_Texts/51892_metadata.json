Having this connection with Nineteenth Amendment is great because by working together we are helping each other to grow.\u201d\n\nMartin studied fashion design at Drexel University in Philadelphia and went on to work in the fashion industry in New York.\n\n\u201cArt has always been a big part of my life. Growing up, I loved being creative and took as many art classes as possible,\u201d she said. \u201cI knew that I wanted to have a career that would allow me to be creative and when I learned how to sew, I realized that I could have the kind of career that I desired by becoming a fashion designer.\u201d\n\nMartin said her label marks the woman who values a classic look but also likes to keep up with current contemporary trends. Prices are from $130.\n\n\u201cI design contemporary women\u2019s ready to wear,\u201d Martin said. \u201cMy clothing reflects my personality. I love to look good but I am also very low maintenance. To me, the best garments are ones that are those that are easily able to integrate into an existing wardrobe but also make a statement on their own. I also prefer clothing that is comfortable to wear. My collection is made up of soft knit fabric garments that are both comfortable and versatile.\u201d\n\nIt has been less than two years since she decided to start her own brand.\n\n\u201cThere are so many talented independent designers out there who struggle with manufacturing, or financing, or brand awareness and aren\u2019t able to grow their business. That\u2019s why I partnered with Nineteenth Amendment,\u201d she said. \u201cThey give independent designers the tools to manufacture in the US and sell to fashion conscious customers around the world.\u201d\n\nVisit http://nineteenthamendment.com/ or http://www.nineteenthamendment.com/ayanna-marie-design/amd-springsummer-2014/ to learn more or purchase selections from Martin\u2019s collection.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://mycj.co/1IgWMAp", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Bridgewater resident Ayanna Martin\u2019s fashion collection is featured on the website Nineteenth Amendment, an online marketplace for fresh, independent fashion", "og": {"site_name": "MY CENTRAL JERSEY", "description": "Bridgewater resident Ayanna Martin\u2019s fashion collection is featured on the website Nineteenth Amendment, an online marketplace for fresh, independent fashion", "title": "Bridgewater designer featured on fashion website", "url": "http://www.mycentraljersey.com/story/news/local/somerset-county/2015/06/03/bridgewater-designer-featured-online/28379001/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/mycentraljersey.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Bridgewater resident Ayanna Martin\u2019s fashion collection is featured on the website Nineteenth Amendment, an online marketplace for fresh, independent fashion", "title": "Bridgewater designer featured on fashion website", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/38e785c7b20cd76b23e09217b8fda142b49a02d8/c=0-42-1038-1080&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/06/02/Bridgewater/B9317516657Z.1_20150602182747_000_G3IATT0VU.1-0.jpg", "creator": "@MyCentralJersey", "site": "@MyCentralJersey", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=859380356", "fb": {"app_id": 177893718898560}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": "Bridgewater, Nineteenth Amendment, Ayanna Marie Design"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd84a\"", "article_summary": "Bridgewater resident Ayanna Martin\u2019s fashion collection is featured on the website Nineteenth Amendment, an online marketplace for fresh, independent fashion.\nBridgewater fashion designer, Ayanna Martin.\n(Photo: Photo courtesy of Ayanna Martin) Story Highlights Martin\u2019s label , Ayanna Marie Design is now available onlineCollection is made up of soft knit fabric garments that are both comfortable and versatileBridgewater resident Ayanna Martin\u2019s fashion collection is featured on the website Nineteenth Amendment, an online marketplace for fresh, independent fashion.\nHaving this connection with Nineteenth Amendment is great because by working together we are helping each other to grow.\u201dMartin studied fashion design at Drexel University in Philadelphia and went on to work in the fashion industry in New York.\nThat\u2019s why I partnered with Nineteenth Amendment,\u201d she said."}
