But it wasn\u2019t until he enlisted his friend Benjamin Franklin that the city\u2019s business and civic leaders got on board. Thirty-three of them signed a petition that was presented to the Pennsylvania Assembly in January 1751, and on May 11 of that year, the assembly granted the hospital a charter.\n\nHelping to influence the decision was a new fundraising technique devised by the ever-inventive Franklin \u2014 the matching fund drive. If hospital organizers could come up with an equal amount, the assembly would contribute 2,000 pounds sterling.\n\nPennsylvania Hospital became the first hospital of a fledgling nation, and it boasts many other firsts:\n\n\u2022 In 1762, a British friend of Franklin donated a book to what became the nation\u2019s first medical library at the hospital.\n\n\u2022 In 1794, Dr. Philip Syng Physick was appointed to the hospital\u2019s medical staff. Physick is now known as \u201cthe father of American surgery,\u201d and, in 1812, introduced the stomach pump.\n\n\u2022 In 1804, the nation\u2019s first surgical amphitheater was constructed.\n\n\u2022 In 1812, Dr. Benjamin Rush, who had been on Pennsylvania Hospital\u2019s staff for nearly 30 years, published the first psychiatric textbook, Observations and Inquiries Upon the Diseases of the Mind. Rush, a signer of the Declaration of Independence, is known as the \u201cfather of American psychiatry.\u201d\n\nOther Pennsylvania Hospital firsts include the introduction of occupational therapy (1752), the first description of hemophilia (1834), the first hospital care of mentally ill patients (1752); and the first daily record of weather conditions (1766).", "article_metadata": {"description": "Thomas Bond had the idea but Ben Franklin the clout, and in 1751 Pennsylvania Hospital got a charter.
