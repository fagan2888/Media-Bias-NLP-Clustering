He scored a 95 on Sunday to win the last major halfpipe contest before the Olympics.\n\nWhite skipped the X Games, choosing training over a shot at his seventh straight title in Aspen.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s bittersweet when Shaun\u2019s not here,\u201d Davis said. \u201cHe\u2019s the one to beat but forget it. I\u2019ll take it.\u201d\n\nWhite\u2019s absence made for a wide-open race and Davis won it, edging Louie Vito by two points. Greg Bretz finished third.\n\nAnother of White\u2019s challengers, Iouri Podladtchikov, couldn\u2019t land his four-twisting \u201cYolo\u201d trick cleanly and finished sixth.\n\nOnly White and Podladtchikov, known as the \u201cI-Pod,\u201d have been attempting the \u201cYolo.\u201d Podladtchikov said he\u2019s convinced no one will win Olympic gold without it.\n\n\u201cI love Danny\u2019s riding,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s gotten so much better, I\u2019m so glad he\u2019s come back. He\u2019s so refreshing to watch. I don\u2019t want to be all full of myself, but I think if I would\u2019ve landed (the Yolo), there wouldn\u2019t have been a question.\u201d\n\nThough Davis won without White in the field, he has beaten the world\u2019s best snowboarder before. That was back in 2010\u2014a victory that all but sewed up his spot at the Vancouver Games.\n\nBut he celebrated too hard and too soon. He broke his pelvis in an accident on an all-terrain vehicle and had to stay home. The last four years have been a slow, rugged set of comebacks from multiple injuries.\n\nDavis got better just in time to sneak onto this year\u2019s U.S. Olympic team, and is starting to peak with the Olympic halfpipe contest 17 days away.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re celebrating by locking Danny into his hotel room,\u201d said a good friend of his, Jack Mitrani. \u201cBecause Sochi\u2019s right around the corner.\u201d\n\nLock him away, but there\u2019s no holding back his creative spirit.\n\nAll week, Davis has been featured in a set of side-splitting reenactments of scenes from \u201cDumb and Dumber\u201d\u2014hair slicked down, some fake teeth in place so he can do a moderately good rendition of Jim Carrey\u2019s character, Lloyd. \u201cI\u2019m talking about a little place called Aspen,\u201d Davis says in one of the skits, riffing off a line from the movie.\n\nHis real hair is long and shaggy, his moustache is getting bushy and his style is a mix of 1990\u2019s snowboard flair and 2010\u2019s athletic prowess.\n\nThe first two tricks in his winning run simply aren\u2019t seen much anymore\u2014a backside 360-degree jump that leaves him flying blind until he\u2019s practically hitting the bottom of the pipe; and then an old-school and rather difficult backward, straight air jump with a grab of the board in which he tweaks his legs the way they did back in the day.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s snowboarding,\u201d Davis said. \u201cI\u2019m going to keep snowboarding the way I want to snowboard. Right now, the judges are rewarding me for it and I couldn\u2019t be happier about that.\u201d\n\nHe stomped the landings on those tricks, and all the rest on his winning run, and was rewarded with a gold medal.\n\nCould another one be in store?\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not impossible,\u201d Davis said. \u201cI\u2019ll have to be at my very best but Shaun will have to be at his very best, too.\u201d\n\nNOTES: Nick Goepper heads into the Olympics on a high note after landing a triple cork jump during his final run to defend his ski slopestyle title. \u2026 Kaya Turski of Canada is rounding back into form five months after tearing her left ACL.
