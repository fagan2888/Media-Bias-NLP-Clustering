Instead, they were aided by the avarice of the American people, who were not victims of the crash so much as accomplices in it. Respondents to a Rasmussen poll done during the throes of the crisis overwhelmingly blamed \u201cindividuals who borrowed more than they could afford\u201d (54 percent) over Wall Street (25 percent). To this day, the view is widespread and bipartisan: Main Street was an essential cause of the meltdown. The enemy was us.\n\n\u201cIt all goes back to the increase in the tolerance for debt,\u201d David Brooks wrote a couple of years ago. The Brookings Institution, meanwhile, has argued that of all the possible crisis narratives, \u201c \u2018everyone was at fault\u2019 comes closest to the truth.\u201d The \u201cwider society\u201d must face the music, it said in a 2009 paper. \u201cPeople in all types of institutions and as individuals became blas\u00e9 about risk-taking and leverage.\u201d\n\nOr, as Michael Lewis, our financial-writer laureate, observed: \u201cThe tsunami of cheap credit ... was temptation, offering entire societies the chance to reveal aspects of their characters they could not normally afford to indulge.\u201d Reveal themselves, they did, and it wasn\u2019t pretty. Writing for Vanity Fair, Lewis quoted at length Dr. Peter Whybrow, a British neuroscientist at UCLA, who posited that human beings have \u201cthe core of the average lizard.\u201d Lewis, running with the analogy, relayed Whybrow\u2019s conclusion, which was that \u201cthe succession of financial bubbles, and the amassing of personal and public debt\u201d were \u201csimply an expression of the lizard-brained way of life.\u201d\n\nIs that not the truth?\n\nActually: No, it\u2019s not. The notion that American consumers share the blame for the mortgage crisis is a lie. And it is one of the most pernicious out there.\n\n\n\n\n\nEveryone-Is-To-Blame (or EITB, for brevity\u2019s sake) has done much to mute the public outcry essential for sweeping efforts to respond to the financial catastrophe. To the extent that Dodd-Frank fell short of the root-and-branch reform that followed the last great crash in 1929, EITB is to blame. The fact that banks too big to fail before the crisis have been allowed to grow to twice their pre-bubble sizes can be traced to a nagging sense that they didn\u2019t act alone. And if you wonder why, six years after the fact, no significant Wall Street figure has been criminally prosecuted, I would suggest that EITB has muddied perceptions just enough to allow the administration to sidestep the necessary legal mobilization. If everyone is to blame, then criminal indictments of individual executives can be framed as exercises in scapegoating.\n\nEveryone-is-to-blame did its worst damage to the Home Affordable Modification Program, or HAMP, an effort rolled out in the immediate aftermath of the crisis to reduce borrowers\u2019 monthly payments through refinancing or principal write-downs. It was the mere idea of HAMP that set off Rick Santelli on his 2009 rant about \u201closers\u2019 mortgages\u201d and their \u201cextra bathroom,\u201d sparking the Tea Party revolt. The prospect of helping delinquent borrowers, while others paid theirs on time, unleashed a flood of ressentiment that filled the Congressional Record with denunciations of \u201cirresponsible\u201d actors who \u201clied\u201d only to wind up in line for \u201cgift equity,\u201d and \u201ctax-payer subsidized windfall.\u201d Wisconsin Representative Jim Sensenbrenner introduced the concept of \u201chappy-go-lucky borrowers\u201d and \u201ccagey borrowers.\u201d Jim Bunning, then Kentucky\u2019s junior senator, felt compelled to warn against helping homeowners \u201cwho made bad decisions.\u201d The outpouring tapped into a sentiment powerful enough to silence even some liberals and turned hamp into a political disaster for the Obama administration. Left adrift, the program went from a potential lifeline for borrowers to a fee-machine for servicers and a Kafkaesque nightmare for those it was supposed to help.\n\nAs an agent of obfuscation, EITB is a gift that keeps on giving. In October, The Washington Post\u2019s editorial board objected to a $13 billion mortgage-era civil settlement with J.P. Morgan largely because it unfairly singled out the bank, when, in fact, \u201ceveryone, from Wall Street to Main Street to Washington, acted on widely held economic beliefs that turned out not to be true.\u201d A forthcoming book by Bob Ivry, a Polk Award\u2013winning investigative reporter for Bloomberg News (and, full disclosure, a friend), eloquently inveighs against big banks and their Washington lackeys, but also includes this assertion: \u201cIn the years leading up to the Great Bubble-Burst of 2008, everybody got a chance to cash in. ... If you wanted to buy a place to live, you could get more house than you ever dreamed. You could use your rising home equity for the Disney vacation, the power boat, the fourth bedroom or the college education.\u201d\n\nSuch thinking has become the industry standard. In a survey of financial-crisis authors and assorted experts, the overwhelming majority of respondents chose \u201ceverybody was at fault\u201d (25 authors) over Wall Street (10) or the government (11).\n\nI haven\u2019t voted yet, so make that 25-11-11. But even as I write this, I worry that it is too late. Like concrete poured into a foundation, EITB is now hardening into a central pillar of the history of the financial crisis. The fallacy risks ensuring that, when the next crash comes, we will be destined to again botch the response. It\u2019s time to tear out the lie and replace it with the truth.\n\nThe alleged responsibility that the average American bears for the crisis rests largely on the notion that people knowingly (key word) took out bigger, riskier loans than they could afford\u2014and that they all decided to do it rather suddenly around 2004. Which, see, that\u2019s crazy right there.\n\nUnder empirical examination, the myth falls apart completely. Were EITB true, borrowers would have to own at least a third of the blame for the mortgage meltdown, the rest split between Wall Street and the government. The available evidence of borrower culpability comes nowhere near that number.\n\nTo say that borrowers don\u2019t deserve equal blame for the crisis doesn\u2019t mean that every individual borrower was innocent. There is no question that \u201cmortgage fraud\u201d\u2014which the FBI defines as misrepresentations relied upon by underwriters, i.e. banks\u2014did account for a percentage of the losses. It\u2019s just that the amount of borrower behavior fitting that definition is vanishingly small. Before it collapsed, for instance, New Century reported that borrowers had failed to make even the first payment on 2.5 percent of its loans. That doesn\u2019t speak well of borrowers, at all. It\u2019s also only 2.5 percent. Zooming out, the Treasury Department reported that so-called \u201csuspicious activity\u201d reported by banks peaked at 137,000 incidents in 2006. But even if every single one of those reports represents actual borrower fraud (spoiler: they don\u2019t), that\u2019s still only about 1 percent of the 14 million mortgages made that year.\n\nOne way a borrower can defraud a lender is to pretend to plan on living in the home\u2014because mortgages on primary residences are easier to obtain and carry lower rates\u2014when in fact you\u2019re buying it as an investment or vacation property. We know from lawsuits brought by the conservator for Fannie Mae that the number of owner-occupied houses in the mortgage pool was off by as much as 15 percentage points. Some portion of those houses belonged to people who said they lived in them, but didn\u2019t. That\u2019s definitely something buyers fib about. On the other hand, it often requires a wink from the bank, since residency is easy to check. But most important: Even if the number is the full 15 percent, that\u2019s still well south of EITB.\n\nIn 2010, an FBI report drawing on figures from the consultancy Corelogic put total fraudulent mortgages during the peak boom year of 2006 at more than $25 billion. Twenty-five billion dollars is obviously not nothing. But here again, teasing those mortgages out of that year\u2019s crisis-related write-downs of $2.7 trillion from U.S.-originated assets leaves our infamous \u201ccagey\u201d borrowers to blame for only a tiny share of the damage, especially since not all of the fraudulent mortgages were their fault. The ratio looks roughly something like this:\n\nYes, some of our cab drivers, shoeshine boys, and other fellow citizens tricked a lender into helping them take a flyer on the housing market. But the combined share of the blame for bad mortgages that can be placed on the public sits\u2014and I\u2019m really rounding up here\u2014in the high single digits, and not the much larger, fuzzier numbers in our heads.\n\nThe fact is that defrauding a bank that actually cares about the quality of a loan is actually rather difficult, no matter how aggressive or deceitful the borrower. Lenders, on the other hand, can lie with relative ease about all sorts of things, and mountains of evidence show they did so on a widespread basis. For starters, it\u2019s lenders who establish the loan-to-value ratio for a property: how much money the buyer is borrowing versus the house\u2019s estimated worth. Banks didn\u2019t used to let you take out a mortgage too close to the home\u2019s total cost. But play with those numbers and, voil\u00e0, a rejected loan application turns into an accepted one. Leading up to the crash, some banks\u2019 representations about loan-to-value ratios were off by as much as 40 percentage points.\n\nThen there was the apparent rampant corruption of appraisals, which also have nothing whatsoever to do with borrowers. Before the bubble popped, appraisers\u2019 groups collected 11,000 signatures on a petition decrying pressure by banks to arrive at \u201cdishonest\u201d or inflated valuations.\n\nAnd that\u2019s to say nothing of lenders misleading borrowers directly\u2014a practice that the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission, the Levin-Coburn report, and lawsuits by attorneys general around the country have all found was very much systemic. Mortgage brokers forged borrowers\u2019 signatures and altered documents; Ameriquest (those guys again!) had its own \u201cart department,\u201d as it was known internally, for precisely that function. Oh, and remember those 137,000 instances of \u201csuspicious activity\u201d about possible borrower misdeeds? For the sake of perspective, Citigroup settled a Federal Trade Commission case alleging sales deception that involved two million clients in a single year. That\u2019s what we call wholesale, and it was happening before the mortgage era even really got started.\n\nToday, there\u2019s a big and growing body of documentation about what happened as the financial system became incentivized to sell as many loans as possible on the most burdensome possible terms: Millions\u2014and millions\u2014of borrowers were sold subprime despite qualifying for better.\n\nPerhaps the most astonishing and unappreciated finding comes from The Wall Street Journal, which back in December 2007 published a study of more than $2.5 trillion in subprime loans dating to 2000 (that is to say, most of the subprime loans of the era). The story, by my former colleagues Rick Brooks and Ruth Simon, painted the picture of a world gone upside-down: During the worst years of the frenzy, more than half the subprime loans issued went to borrowers who had credit scores \u201chigh enough to often qualify for conventional loans with far better terms.\u201d In 2006, the figure hit 61 percent. Along with its article, the Journal illustrated the alarming trend line with a version of the following graphic:\n\nIt goes without saying that no one would voluntarily eschew a prime loan for subprime\u2014subprime is called that for a reason, carrying higher, often escalating rates; pre-payment penalties that \u201cshut the backdoor\u201d by precluding refinancing; and other burdens tacked on for good measure. The Journal concluded that its analysis \u201craises pointed questions about the practices of major mortgage lenders.\u201d That\u2019s putting it mildly!\n\nLately, a flying squadron of scholars and lawyers, taking up where journalism left off, has dug further into federal housing data to uncover new mind-melting patterns. One of them, Jacob Faber, a Ph.D. candidate at New York University, last year came up with what may be the second-most astonishing fact about the crisis era: In 2006, the year of the locust, some households earning more than $200,000 annually were more likely to be put in subprime than others earning just $32,000. For those unlucky borrowers, income\u2014the best measure of ability to repay\u2014was not the variable that determined the quality of the loan they received.\n\nShort version: That\u2019s not how a fair market works. But it\u2019s what happened. And the real reason those $200,000-plus borrowers found themselves in subprime leads us to the darkest origins of the lending practices that wrecked the economy\u2014as well as of the troubling way we\u2019ve misallocated accountability.\n\nThe idea that the American mortgage borrower went off the deep end has a psychological appeal that is broad and deep. It\u2019s almost reflexive and speaks to a collective misanthropic streak: We know, after all, how people are. For op-ed writers and cocktail-party-goers everywhere, the \u201cwe-all-did-it\u201d view has the advantage of projecting a world-weariness that can be taken for sophistication.\n\nThis attitude also has a literary pedigree. Cultural theorizing about our inherent weakness goes back to the Bible (see Genesis 2:4-3:24, Adam / Eve), but it was Scottish journalist Charles Mackay who most famously dissected the specific phenomenon of contagious folly in his 1841 classic, Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds. Mackay\u2019s work chronicled episodes of mass hysteria\u2014witch hunts, the crusades, alchemy. But most famously, Mackay gave us the parable of the Dutch tulip mania of 1636 to 1637, when flower bulbs briefly became one of the world\u2019s most expensive commodities. A wry and witty stylist, Mackay mixes anecdotes\u2014like one about a sailor who mistook a priceless tulip bulb for an onion to go with his herring breakfast\u2014with mordant observations about human nature. \u201cIn reading the history of nations, we find that, like individuals, they have their whims and their peculiarities; their seasons of excitement and recklessness, when they care not what they do,\u201d Mackay\u2019s preface to the 1852 edition begins. \u201cWe find that whole communities suddenly fix their minds upon one object, and go mad in its pursuit.\u201d\n\nMackay has attracted plenty of support from academics over the decades, particularly scholars of social psychology, and in the years since the crash, his work has been much cited as a master theory of what went wrong. People are greedy. What can you do?\n\nThere\u2019s just one problem: The accounts that undergird Mackay\u2019s thesis might be wrong. As Andrew Odlyzko, a University of Minnesota mathematician who studies financial panics, puts it, Madness \u201cenjoys extraordinarily high renown in the financial industry and among the press and the public. It also has an extraordinarily low reputation among historians.\u201d Peter Garber, a Brown economist, found in a 1990 paper that the most intense speculation in the Dutch tulip market of the era involved only the rarest bulbs, which had been infected by a certain virus that produced particularly intricate patterns in the flower. After that, the market behaved pretty much the way the market for rare bulbs always behaves. Prices for newly cultivated bulbs were high, then fell over time. In fact, the average decline in prices for the rarest bulbs in the five years after the tulip market crashed was, at most, 32 percent. \u201cLarge, but hardly the stuff that legends are made of,\u201d Garber writes.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting here that Mackay himself cited the pivotal role in tulip mania played by bulb brokers, or \u201cjobbers,\u201d as they were known. \u201cEver on the alert for a new speculation,\u201d Mackay wrote, these professionals resorted to \u201call the means they so well know how to employ to cause fluctuations in prices.\u201d Tulip jobbers were pikers compared with our twenty-first-century mortgage dealers. Yet contemporary readers seem to miss that part of Mackay\u2019s story\u2014and meanwhile take the rest as gospel. I have attended too many panel discussions during which business reporters and editors\u2014even as they dutifully acknowledge that Wall Street behaved very badly indeed\u2014airily discuss how \u201cwe\u201d all profited from the boom. At a breakfast gathering in 2009 at a swank private club on New York\u2019s Upper East Side, a nationally known financial writer claimed he knew a crash was coming when his personal trainer quit to become a real-estate broker. Knowing chuckles all around.\n\nHere\u2019s a new thesis: Much more so than borrowers, it\u2019s the elites who\u2019ve chronicled and shaped beliefs on the bust who truly have deluded themselves. Michael Lewis put it as only he can in a passage, still discussing UCLA\u2019s Professor Whybrow, that describes what appears to be a Sherlock moment. If you plot the geography of American personal debt, Lewis wrote, and then place it atop \u201cthe Centers for Disease Control\u2019s color-coded map that illustrates the fantastic rise in rates of obesity across the United States since 1985,\u201d the two would look about the same. \u201cThe boom in trading activity in individual stock portfolios; the spread of legalized gambling; the rise of drug and alcohol addiction\u2014it is all of a piece,\u201d Lewis wrote. \u201cEverywhere you turn you see Americans sacrifice their long-term interests for short-term rewards.\u201d\n\nIt turns out, Lewis / Whybrow were wrong about those maps. As Reuters blogger Felix Salmon later pointed out, obesity and personal debt are in fact negatively correlated; states (California, New Jersey) with the highest debt had the lowest obesity. But such wild stabs at causation have been very much in fashion. The Washington Post\u2019s Richard Cohen, for instance, once tried to link spiking mortgage defaults to the increasing popularity of tattoos. Something about this particular mass disaster\u2014the forced uprooting of ten million Americans, more than the Dust Bowl migration\u2014has made pedigreed observers leap to firm conclusions about their fellow citizens\u2019 honesty and common sense based on the wispiest of associations.\n\nCould that something be the fact that the crisis basically affected people who are not big-shot journalists and policymakers?\n\nWhen we talk about the \u201cborrowers\u201d ruined by the mortgage crisis, we\u2019re not talking about people with prime, fixed-rate loans. That\u2019s Main Street, Mayberry, where delinquencies jumped but stayed in the single digits. We\u2019re talking about subprime, where serious delinquencies topped 40 percent. And when we talk about subprime, we really mean black and Hispanic homeowners, who held those loans in vastly disproportionate numbers.\n\nObviously, the story of the crisis transcends race\u2014whites on the whole were more likely to undergo foreclosure than blacks\u2014but there\u2019s also no disentangling race from the broader trends. It is a matter of historical record that some minority communities were excluded from the credit system for decades through the policy known as redlining. And that, beginning in the \u201990s, those same communities were inundated by a new, heavily marketed, risky mortgage product, which we would later come to know as subprime. Activists accurately called this process \u201creverse redlining\u201d and (even more accurately) \u201cpredatory lending.\u201d The new industry peddling those loans collapsed in scandal by the end of the decade, but as part of its legacy, foreclosures would spike in the inner cities of Cleveland, Pittsburgh, and Chicago, leaving more than half the states and a dozen municipalities scrambling to enact regulations. Even Alan Greenspan felt compelled to speak out: \u201cDiscrimination is against the interests of business; yet business people too often practice it,\u201d he said. This was the spring of 2000. Then, the deluge.\n\nAt the height of the madness, when subprime made up an insane 27 percent of the multitrillion-dollar home-loan market, nearly half of new African American mortgage holders found themselves in one. Black and Latino borrowers with credit scores of more than 660 were more than three times as likely to be in a subprime loan than their white counterparts. One company, BNC Mortgages, had a customer base nearly 50 percent black or Hispanic, and more than 95 percent of the mortgages it issued were subprime. Fun fact: BNC was a wholly owned unit of Lehman Brothers.\n\nLet\u2019s return to Jacob Faber and his finding about those high-earning families finding themselves with subprime loans. Of course it was African American households earning more than $200,000 who were more likely to wind up in subprime than white households earning $32,000. Go ahead and roll that around for a minute. Graphically it looks like this:\n\nInevitably, the disparities persisted at the other end of the process. Research shows that upper-income blacks and Latinos were more likely to be foreclosed upon than lower-income whites. In predominantly minority neighborhoods, according to a 2011 report from the Center for Responsible Lending, fully 20 percent of all borrowers lost their homes or went into serious delinquency.\n\nThe more we peek inside the subprime machinery, the nastier its racial dynamics look. At Wells Fargo, according to the city of Baltimore\u2019s suit against the firm, mortgage brokers introduced into their lexicon such terms as \u201cmud people\u201d and \u201cghetto loans.\u201d Elizabeth Jacobson, who one year made $700,000 in commissions while working as a subprime loan officer for the bank, explained in an affidavit that prime loan officers, known as \u201cA reps,\u201d were given handsome referral fees for feeding her prime-qualified customers to whom she could give more expensive and more dangerous mortgages\u2014and did so by the hundreds. Prince George\u2019s County, a solidly middle-class black bastion, was jokingly referred to around the company water cooler as the \u201csubprime capital of Maryland.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m not suggesting that Wall Street has gotten a free pass on its role in the crisis. People get it, sort of. But we also grade on a curve that assumes that banks\u2019 criminal or quasi-criminal conspiracies are par for the course, Wall Street just being Wall Street. In real life, Jordan Belfort, the inspiration for Leonardo DiCaprio\u2019s guilty-pleasure, Oscar-nominated performance in The Wolf of Wall Street, was a possible sociopath who bamboozled retirees with the bad luck to pick up the phone when his boiler-room operation cold-called. But, hey, at least he had style. Borrowers who wound up underwater, by contrast, are pitiful at best. Either they were greedy or dumb or both. They really should have been more careful.\n\nSorry, everybody was not to blame. \u201cWe\u201d didn\u2019t all do it. \u201cMain Street\u201d didn\u2019t succumb to a new tulip mania, and cheap credit didn\u2019t expose anything but the corruption and immorality of a financial industry that systematically put huge numbers of even credit-worthy borrowers into defective products. Cultural theorizing\u2014especially the evidence-free kind\u2014should be seen for what it is: an exercise in complacency. It\u2019s easy. And it\u2019s what you lean on when you don\u2019t want to take on structural problems, the kind you actually have to do something about.\n\n\n\nDean Starkman, a reporting fellow with The Investigative Fund at the Nation Institute and an editor at the Columbia Journalism Review, is the author of The WatchDog that Didn\u2019t Bark: The Financial Crisis and the Disappearance of Investigative Journalism.
