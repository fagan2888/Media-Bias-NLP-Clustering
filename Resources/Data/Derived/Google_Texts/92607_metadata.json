When he returned to search the debris on Oct. 29, his reports for international monitors documenting the annual mobilization had vanished.\n\nHuman rights groups say Tihonov is a victim of Uzbekistan\u2019s efforts to conceal a massive, state-orchestrated forced labor system that underpins its position as the world\u2019s fifth-largest cotton exporter. They cite regular arrests, intimidation and harassment of activists.\n\nThe activist from Angren, a town about 62 miles (100 km) east of the capital Tashkent, says he\u2019s under constant surveillance by local authorities to remind people \u201cit\u2019s better to keep away from me\u201d \u2013 an allegation that Reuters could not independently confirm.\n\nPersecution of activists is among many abuses cited by witnesses and human rights groups that fueled discord in the Obama administration this year over how much criticism Central Asia's most populous nation deserved in the U.S. State Department\u2019s annual report on modern slavery.\n\nIn a previously undisclosed memo, analysts in the State Department\u2019s Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons called forced labor \u201cendemic\u201d during the cotton harvest and said Uzbekistan had \"failed to make significant and sustained efforts\" to improve its record. The early 2015 memo, reviewed by Reuters, recommended keeping Uzbekistan in the lowest tier of the report\u2019s rankings, raising the specter of economic sanctions on a country whose cotton is used in yarn and fabric that play a significant role in the global supply chain.\n\nBut senior U.S. diplomats rejected the recommendation, downplaying concerns about human rights in a strategically important country.\n\nThe landlocked nation of deserts, mountains and steppes was a transit point for U.S. troops and supplies during the war in neighboring Afghanistan. Washington now wants its help preventing the spread of Islamic militants, stabilizing Afghanistan and offsetting Russian influence in the region.\n\nWhen the State Department issued its 2015 Trafficking in Persons (TIP) Report in July, Uzbekistan was elevated from the bottom tier of violators. Uzbekistan doesn\u2019t meet \u201cminimum standards\u201d to end trafficking, the report said, but it is \u201cmaking significant efforts\u201d \u2013 a caveat absent from the analysts\u2019 assessment.\n\nUzbekistan\u2019s government makes an estimated $1 billion a year from cotton sales, and the harvest mobilizations of roughly a million people that date to Soviet times are characterized as a patriotic duty. Uzbek officials did not answer repeated requests for comment but generally argue that citizens pick cotton voluntarily.\n\nA Reuters examination \u2013 based on interviews with local officials, activists and workers in the fields \u2013 found that while the country has made progress ending child labor in the harvest, it has intensified recruitment of adults and older teenagers using the same coercive approach.\n\nThe State Department\u2019s decision to rebuff its experts\u2019 recommendation and upgrade Uzbekistan's rating in the trafficking report reinforces a Reuters article in August that said senior diplomats inflated assessments of 14 strategically important countries in the annual review, including the central Asian country. The yearly review is meant to independently grade countries on trafficking and forced labor.\n\nDespite Uzbekistan\u2019s progress barring children from the fields, \u201cI don\u2019t see any evidence that this very fundamental form of coercive labor has changed,\u201d says former U.S. ambassador-at-large Mark Lagon, who headed the State Department\u2019s anti-trafficking office from 2007-2009. Uzbekistan still has a \u201cmiserable human rights profile.\u201d\n\nAsked for comment, a State Department official defended Uzbekistan\u2019s upgrade, saying the department stands by \u201cthe integrity of the process\u201d for determining country rankings.\n\n\u201cAre they still mobilizing workers? Yes,\u201d said a senior official who accompanied Secretary of State John Kerry on a Nov. 1 visit to Uzbekistan. But \u201cif you don\u2019t show recognition of improved behavior (on child labor), you risk them deciding it\u2019s not worth the effort and then doing nothing.\u201d\n\nSTRATEGIC IMPORTANCE\n\nU.S. policymakers have struggled for two decades to balance concern about Uzbekistan\u2019s human rights record with the need to maintain relations with hard-line President Islam Karimov.\n\n\"It\u2019s a natural geopolitical alliance but it\u2019s complicated because of his human rights record,\" says John Herbst, U.S. ambassador to Uzbekistan from 2000-2003. \"His authoritarian regime is not very consistent with our principles.\"\n\nSpeaking to reporters before his November meeting with Karimov in the ancient Silk Road city of Samarkand, Kerry spoke of \u201cshared interests,\u201d especially combating Islamic extremism, but his references to human rights were oblique. He noted a need to address \u201cthe human dimension\u201d of Uzbek governance. Reuters was unable to determine whether they discussed forced labor in their private meeting.\n\nUzbekistan took initial steps to bar children from picking cotton in 2012 and the effort expanded in 2013, when the State Department downgraded the country in the trafficking report to the \u201cTier 3\u201d \u2013 the lowest rank shared by North Korea and a few other countries. In last year\u2019s report, Uzbekistan remained at Tier 3, and its prohibitions on child labor grew more stringent.\n\nBut the dearth of child workers led to increased conscription of adults and older teens, according to a dozen witnesses of the harvest interviewed by Reuters.\n\nStill facing the same government-imposed harvesting quotas, local authorities expanded mobilizations of public employees, such as teachers, nurses and bureaucrats, as well as private sector workers, the witnesses said. While young, school-age children were not forcibly mobilized on a mass scale, many 17-year olds were coerced along with some younger children in the later weeks of the harvest to meet quotas, they added. \"NO WAY OF REFUSING\"\n\nA dozen workers interviewed by Reuters in September all requested anonymity, saying they feared retribution.\n\nAmong them, a plumber, 46, said he was bused 250 km (155 miles) to pick cotton for 15 days. When he returned, another group of employees went out. Food and lodging were provided in dilapidated barracks. \u201cThere was no way of refusing,\u201d he said.\n\nA pensioner, 64, said each household in her town was directed to send a volunteer to pick cotton. She feared those that didn\u2019t would be \u201con the black list\u201d and lose public benefits. Because her son runs a small shop that supports the family, she went to the fields herself.\n\nA history teacher, 49, said staff at her school were told to pick cotton for 20 days or pay the equivalent of about $400 each to support the harvest. She refused and, facing termination, resigned.\n\nReuters was unable to independently confirm these accounts. BACK IN WASHINGTON, DC.\n\nThe State Department\u2019s human rights analysts lacked support this year as they pushed to keep Uzbekistan at the bottom of the rankings, according to congressional sources, and current and former U.S. officials.\n\nThe trafficking office\u2019s director had left, and the department brought in a retired diplomat as acting director for a few months while rankings were decided. Patricia Butenis, former ambassador to Sri Lanka and Bangladesh, opposed the analysts on Uzbekistan, according to officials involved, leaving them without high-level advocacy.\n\nAt a meeting that included the U.S. ambassador to Uzbekistan, Butenis pushed for the country to be upgraded against the recommendation of the analysts she represented, the sources said. She urged the analysts to consider what she described as the \u201cbig picture\u201d implications of keeping Uzbekistan at Tier 3, they added.\n\nThe State Department declined to discuss \u201cinternal deliberations.\u201d An official noted that country rankings ultimately are decided by the secretary of state, based \u201csolely\u201d on staff input. Butenis, now retired, declined comment.\n\nUzbekistan\u2019s Tier 3 ranking in the 2013 and 2014 reports helped a coalition of human rights groups, the Cotton Campaign, organize a boycott of Uzbek cotton by more than 200 apparel manufacturers and retailers, including Gap Inc, American Eagle Outfitters Inc and Wal-Mart Stores Inc..\n\nAmerican Eagle said it had no plans to change a ban on using Uzbek cotton it has had in place since 2008. Gap and Wal-Mart did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe U.S. upgrade of Uzbekistan has not changed the boycott, said Patricia Jurewicz, director of Responsible Sourcing Network, an advocacy group in California that maintains a list of companies that have pledged \"to not knowingly\" source Uzbek cotton until the country \"ends the practice of forced child and adult labor in its cotton sector.\"\n\nBut big cotton processors such as Singapore's Olam International Ltd and South Korea\u2019s Daewoo International Corp, still buy Uzbek cotton, the companies said.\n\nOlam said it could not answer specific queries on Uzbek cotton, but added it was working with the government and other bodies to address labor issues.\n\nBecause of weakness in the global economy, demand for Daewoo\u2019s Uzbek cotton has weakened, a Daewoo company spokesman told Reuters. He declined to comment on the country\u2019s forced labor conditions but welcomed Uzbekistan\u2019s upgrade in the trafficking report as \u201cdefinitely good\u201d.\n\n(Additional reporting by Dmitry Solovyov in Moscow, Meeyoung Cho in Seoul, and Nathan Layne in Chicago.
