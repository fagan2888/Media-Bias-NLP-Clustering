Never mind the immigrants, the latest person in Donald Trump’s sights is Heidi Klum.

According to a New York Times interview the Republican frontrunner did with Maureen Dowd (for some inexplicable reason), Donald Trump believes that Heidi Klum, a former Victoria’s Secret angel and one of the world’s most beautiful women, has lost some of her luster as of late. According to Donald, “she’s no longer a 10.”

Heidi, of course, thinks differently, and responded on Twitter…sans most of her shirt.

Trump has not responded to Klum’s comments. But I’m sure it’s only just a matter of time.
