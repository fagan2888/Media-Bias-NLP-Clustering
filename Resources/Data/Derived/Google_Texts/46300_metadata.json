Lindsey Graham (R). It should come as no surprise, then, that Graham wholeheartedly supports war with ISIS, though the plan of attack proposed by President Obama is little more than a playful slap when compared with the brutal smackdown Graham has in mind: American troops, on the ground, fighting ISIS for as long as it takes.\n\nAnd why is such a smackdown necessary? Because ISIS fighters are coming to America to kill us all\u2014and we have to get them before it's too late, Graham said on Fox News Sunday:\n\nThis is a radical Islamic army that's pushing the theory of a master religion, not a master race like the Nazis. This is not about bringing a few people to justice who behead the innocent in a brutal fashion. It's about protecting millions of people throughout the world from a radical Islamic army. They are intending to come here. ... There is no way in hell you can form an army on the ground to go into Syria, to destroy ISIL without a substantial American component. ... This is a turning point in the War on Terror. Our strategy will fail, yet again. This president needs to rise to the occasion before we all get killed here at home.\n\n(Emphasis mine.) As far as relentlessly propagandizing in favor of war goes, surely Graham is the worst possible offender. He is blatantly trying to scare people\u2014crazy Muslims are coming to kill you!\u2014in hopes of keeping a war-weary public in support of his mission.\n\nGraham is lying. ISIS has \"no credible plan\" to attack the U.S., nor does it have the capability to do so. The terrorist group's many hostile neighbors are keeping it bogged down. In fact, the best way to ensure that fewer Americans die at the hands of ISIS is to keep American troops at home, away from the Middle East and out of a sectarian conflict that dates back hundreds of years.\n\nWatch Graham trying to frighten people below.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "Of all the war cheerleaders in Congress, no one is more remarkably and consistently dedicated to ceaseless military conflict than South Carolina Sen.", "title": "Propaganda Watch: Lindsey Graham Says ISIS Coming to U.S. to Kill Everyone", "url": "http://reason.com/blog/2014/09/15/war-propaganda-watch-lindsey-graham-says", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14107573701212.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Of all the war cheerleaders in Congress, no one is more\nremarkably and consistently dedicated to ceaseless military\nconflict than South Carolina Sen.
