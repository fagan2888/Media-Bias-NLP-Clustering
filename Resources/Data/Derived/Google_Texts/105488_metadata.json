He died in a Winter Park avalanche in 2012.\n\nNorris, a father of two, was skiing inbounds on Winter Park\u2019s Trestle Trees run on Jan. 22, 2012, when he triggered a slide that was 40 feet wide and ran 30 vertical feet and was enough to bury him.\n\nHis widow, Salyndra Fleury, filed a lawsuit, saying the ski operators knew about the avalanche danger that day and should have roped off the area.\n\nThe appellate court\u2019s ruling says the risk of avalanche is implied in the Colorado Ski Safety Act \u2014 the law that spells out the sport\u2019s \u201cinherent dangers\u201d and the liability of ski operators.\n\nThe law says skiers and snowboarders should know they may encounter changing weather and snow conditions and steep terrain.\n\nDespite the law saying nothing about avalanches, the appellate court said \u201can avalanche falls neatly into the examples of dangers in the Act.\u201d They are a product of changing snow and weather conditions and occur on steep terrain, the ruling states.\n\nIn dissent, Judge Jerry Jones said avalanches shouldn\u2019t be \u201cintrinsic to the sport of skiing on open, designated ski trails within ski areas.\u201d\n\nWe agree. By all means, skiers should understand that hurtling downhill on waxed boards through icy, forested land will never be safe.\n\nBut at least they ought to know when an area is prone to an avalanche.\n\nColorado averages 5.5 avalanche deaths every year. Already this year, there have been six avalanche-related deaths in the state, and it\u2019s only February.\n\nOn the day that Norris died, the Colorado Avalanche Information Center sent out a warning about the conditions, advising people to ski in the safety of a ski resort.\n\nThe appellate court\u2019s ruling acknowledged that the General Assembly over the years has continually broadened ski area operators\u2019 immunity for skier injuries. We think in the cases of avalanches, it should be reined in a bit.\n\nThe law should be changed to compel ski resorts to inform skiers when avalanche risk is high and signs should be posted on problematic runs.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Require warnings of avalanche risk", "title": "Require warnings of avalanche risk", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/02/21/require-warnings-of-avalanche-risk/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140221__20140223_Z00_OP23E_AVALANCHEp1-1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140221__20140223_Z00_OP23E_AVALANCHEp1-1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-02-21T15:02:43+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-28T01:04:14+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0a31\"", "article_summary": "The law should be changed to compel ski resorts to inform skiers when avalanche risk is high and signs should be posted on problematic runs.\nThe appellate court\u2019s ruling says the risk of avalanche is implied in the Colorado Ski Safety Act \u2014 the law that spells out the sport\u2019s \u201cinherent dangers\u201d and the liability of ski operators.\nA recent ruling by the Colorado Court of Appeals that ski resorts don\u2019t have to warn skiers or close runs when avalanche risk is high is troubling \u2014 and demands a change to the Colorado Ski Safety Act.\nOn the day that Norris died, the Colorado Avalanche Information Center sent out a warning about the conditions, advising people to ski in the safety of a ski resort.\nThe law says skiers and snowboarders should know they may encounter changing weather and snow conditions and steep terrain."}
