Just last month, three former executives from Tokyo Electric Power (Tepco), the company that operated Fukushima Daiichi, were indicted for failing to take safety measures to prevent a nuclear disaster. They are the first Tepco officials to charged over the meltdown.\n\nThe government's immediate response to the disasters was \"very complicated,\" Kan told CNBC.\n\n\"The natural disaster and the nuclear accident occurred and unfolded at the same time. That was the most difficult aspect,\" he said.\n\n\"If it had only been the earthquake and tsunami, the first stages would have been difficult. There were lots of victims, but there were previous examples of how to respond,\" he said. \"In the case of the nuclear crisis, we didn't know how serious it would become. The situation kept escalating.\"\n\nKan cautioned that the nuclear disaster was not yet over.\n\n\"There is still contaminated water coming out of the buildings of reactor one to four. Tepco says it is storing it in tanks, but part of it is leaking out into the ocean,\" he said, adding that radioactive particles were also still leaking, while nuclear debris remained in the reactors that melted down.\n\nAdditionally, the human cost of the disaster was ongoing, he noted.\n\n\"There are still more than 100,000 evacuees from Fukushima who are unable to return home. Even if the government and Fukushima prefecture say they will, there are still many women with young children who have decided to leave the area,\" he said.\n\n\u2014Reuters contributed to this article\n\nFollow CNBC International on Twitter and Facebook.\n\n\n\n\u2014By CNBC.Com's Leslie Shaffer; Follow her on Twitter @LeslieShaffer1", "article_metadata": {"AssetType": "cnbcnewsstory", "description": "As the fifth anniversary of Japan's massive earthquake and nuclear disaster approaches, the country's former prime minister said it was time to do without nuclear power.", "author": "Written by Leslie Shaffer | Interview by Akiko Fujita", "og": {"site_name": "CNBC", "description": "As the fifth anniversary of Japan's massive earthquake and nuclear disaster nears, the former prime minister said it's time to do without nuclear power.", "title": "Japan ex-PM Kan: We can do without nuclear power", "url": "http://www.cnbc.com/2016/03/06/five-years-after-fukushima-nuclear-disaster-nuclear-power-not-needed-former-japan-pm-naoto-kan-says.html", "image": "http://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2016/03/06/103446366-GettyImages-513973910.1910x1000.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "As the fifth anniversary of Japan's massive earthquake and nuclear disaster nears, the former prime minister said it's time to do without nuclear power.", "title": "Five years after Fukushima disaster, there's no need for nuclear power, says former Japan PM Naoto Kan", "url": "http://www.cnbc.com/2016/03/06/five-years-after-fukushima-nuclear-disaster-nuclear-power-not-needed-former-japan-pm-naoto-kan-says.html", "image": {"src": "http://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2016/03/06/103446366-GettyImages-513973910.1910x1000.jpg"}, "creator": "@LeslieShaffer1", "site": "@CNBC", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "al": {"ios": {"app_name": "CNBC Business News and Finance", "app_store_id": 398018310}}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=398018310", "GOOGLEBOT": "unavailable_after: 31 Dec 9999 23:59:59 GMT", "keywords": "Energy, Asia: News, Politics, Japan, Renewable Energy, Natural Disasters, Nuclear Energy, Earthquakes, business news", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/cnbc", "published_time": "2016-03-06T21:12:37-0500", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/CNBC", "section": "Energy", "modified_time": "2016-03-06T22:16:41-0500", "tag": "Earthquakes"}, "pageNodeId": 103446369, "news_keywords": "Fukushima nuclear disaster, anniversary Japan earthquake, Naoto Kan, Great East Japan Earthquake"}, "article_summary": "Kan cautioned that the nuclear disaster was not yet over.\nJust last month, three former executives from Tokyo Electric Power (Tepco), the company that operated Fukushima Daiichi, were indicted for failing to take safety measures to prevent a nuclear disaster.\nFive years on, the decommissioning effort at Fukushima Daiichi is still in its early stages, and is expected to take 30 to 40 years.\n\"The natural disaster and the nuclear accident occurred and unfolded at the same time.\n\"If it had only been the earthquake and tsunami, the first stages would have been difficult."}
