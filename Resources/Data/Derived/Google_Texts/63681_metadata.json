Please RSVP here.\n\nAccording to the Florida Department of Health, a total of 5,377 Floridians were diagnosed with HIV in 2013. That number is higher than anywhere else in the nation.\n\nWUSF and its statewide reporting project, Health News Florida, have been sharing the stories of HIV patients and their communities. We invite you to join us as the conversation continues with a panel discussion moderated by Carson Cooper, the host of WUSF\u2019s weekly public affairs show, Florida Matters. Our panelists include Health News Florida editor Mary Shedden; Debbie Sergi-Laws with Sarasota\u2019s Comprehensive Care Clinic; and Dr. Vilma Vega with Infectious Disease Associates in Sarasota. Audience members will be invited to ask questions as well.\n\nWhen it comes to the presence of HIV in Florida, the state\u2019s six largest metropolitan areas could be states unto themselves. Here is some perspective:\n\n\u00b7 Older Floridians accounted for 23 percent of the new infections in 2013. Of all cases of HIV in the state, 44 percent are 50 years of age or older.\n\n\u00b7 If Miami-Fort Lauderdale-West Palm Beach were a state, it would rank sixth nationally in the number of new cases. The Tampa Bay and Central Florida metro regions each saw more new cases than two dozen other states.\n\n\u00b7 The gay community has been living with the realities of HIV infection since the disease emerged in the 1980s. And while it\u2019s at the forefront of many prevention efforts, infections persist.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"category": "HNF Stories", "description": "You can join us and be a part of our audience for a special Florida Matters town hall on the rising tide of HIV infection in Florida.\u00a0 The taping on", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://health.wusf.usf.edu/post/join-us-special-florida-matters-town-hall-sept-1", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/shared/npr/styles/medium/nprshared/201508/436302306.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "You can join us and be a part of our audience for a special Florida Matters town hall on the rising tide of HIV infection in Florida.\u00a0 The taping on", "title": "Join Us Tuesday For A Special Florida Matters Town Hall"}, "story_id": 431677864, "twitter": {"site": "@HealthNewsFL", "card": "summary", "creator": "@"}, "author": "Lottie Watts", "org_id": 671, "dc": {"title": "Join Us Tuesday For A Special Florida Matters Town Hall"}, "nid": 11634, "datePublished": "2015-08-14", "keywords": "Florida Matters, HIV, HIV In Florida", "wordCount": 420, "has_audio": 0, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce98f\"", "article_summary": "You can join us and be a part of our audience for a special Florida Matters town hall on the rising tide of HIV infection in Florida.\nWe invite you to join us as the conversation continues with a panel discussion moderated by Carson Cooper, the host of WUSF\u2019s weekly public affairs show, Florida Matters.\nWhen it comes to the presence of HIV in Florida, the state\u2019s six largest metropolitan areas could be states unto themselves.\nWUSF and its statewide reporting project, Health News Florida, have been sharing the stories of HIV patients and their communities.\nAccording to the Florida Department of Health, a total of 5,377 Floridians were diagnosed with HIV in 2013."}
