He will be based in Washington and New York.\n\nIt is Loeb & Loeb\u2019s first attempt at formally building and expanding an FDA regulatory practice, an area that has been carved out by many large U.S. law firms, including Hogan Lovells, Covington & Burling and King & Spalding, and boutique law firms Olsson Frank Weeda Terman Matz and Hyman, and Phelps & McNamara.\n\nLoeb & Loeb is not the only firm making moves to bulk up in food and drug law. Venable on Monday announced that it has added Heili Kim, a former regulatory lawyer at the FDA, to its Washington office.\n\nLoeb & Loeb represents companies that are regulated by the FDA \u2014 including pharmaceutical, medical-device, and vitamin and supplement makers \u2014 as well as banks and private-equity firms that supply capital for them. The firm also represents e-commerce platforms, where the sale and distribution of FDA-regulated products is increasing exponentially.\n\n\u201cAs that practice grows and thrives, the regulatory compliance element of the FDA has become more and more prominent in the representation of our clients,\u201d said David Schaefer, deputy chairman of Loeb & Loeb.\n\nThe FDA has been tightening up the enforcement of food-safety laws, particularly since the Food Safety Modernization Act was signed into law in 2011, said Ivan Wasserman of Manatt Phelps & Phillips, an FDA attorney for\n\ndietary-supplement makers. The law gives the FDA more authority in ordering product recalls and detaining products that it suspects are unsafe, and imposes stricter registration requirements for facilities that manufacture, process and pack food.\n\nThere are also several provisions in the Affordable Care Act that apply to medical-device manufacturers, and many in the technology industry are waiting to see what role the FDA will play in regulating mobile medical apps.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s an enormous amount of new requirements and changes in the way manufacturers, whether they\u2019re pharmaceuticals, medical devices or biotech, are going to conduct business,\u201d Liebman said.\n\nThe changes are an opportunity for law firms to cash in on new legal work.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been a really sea change in how the FDA is going to regulate food manufacturing in the future,\u201d Wasserman said. \u201cAs the new rules and regulations are implemented, companies are going to need a lot of regulatory assistance.\u201d\n\nProducts regulated by the FDA represent about 25 percent of the U.S. economy, according to the agency\u2019s estimate. Those products tend to be recession-proof \u2014 food, drugs and medical devices \u2014 and are prone to litigation, a major moneymaker for law firms.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been an explosion in class-action litigation with respect to food claims,\u201d Wasserman said. \u201cAnd on the drug side, the competition between generic drugs and innovator drugs on patents and FDA marketing authorities are high-ticket litigation.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "As wave of new federal regulations hit food, drug and medical device makers, law firms cash in", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=1216470", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "As wave of new federal regulations hit food, drug and medical device makers, law firms cash in", "title": "Loeb & Loeb the latest law firm to see opportunity in food safety and drug law", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/capitalbusiness/stricter-food-safety-rules-may-mean-more-business-for-washington-area-law-firms/2014/02/03/22c4103c-8855-11e3-a5bd-844629433ba3_story.html", "image": "https://images.washingtonpost.com/?url=https://img.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/twp-3000x1568.jpg&w=1484&op=resize&opt=1&filter=antialias", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@WapoCat"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/capitalbusiness/stricter-food-safety-rules-may-mean-more-business-for-washington-area-law-firms/2014/02/03/22c4103c-8855-11e3-a5bd-844629433ba3_story.html", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "capbiznews, Loeb & Loeb, FDA regulation, Food and Drug Administration, Ivan Wasserman, Manatt Phelps & Phillips, Scott Liebman", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=1216470"}, "eomportal-uuid": "22c4103c-8855-11e3-a5bd-844629433ba3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "capbiznews, Loeb & Loeb, FDA regulation, Food and Drug Administration, Ivan Wasserman, Manatt Phelps & Phillips, Scott Liebman"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1618\"", "article_summary": "A burst of new federal rules regulating food manufacturing and medical devices is ushering in new business opportunities for law firms.\nLoeb & Loeb is not the only firm making moves to bulk up in food and drug law.\nThe changes are an opportunity for law firms to cash in on new legal work.\nThose products tend to be recession-proof \u2014 food, drugs and medical devices \u2014 and are prone to litigation, a major moneymaker for law firms.\nLoeb & Loeb represents companies that are regulated by the FDA \u2014 including pharmaceutical, medical-device, and vitamin and supplement makers \u2014 as well as banks and private-equity firms that supply capital for them."}
