On Saturday, Politico reported that Democrats are coming to the grim realization that much of the party\u2019s talent pool was crushed on Tuesday.\n\nIn Maryland, the state\u2019s lieutenant governor, an Iraq War veteran and Harvard alumnus, failed to win the state\u2019s governor\u2019s mansion despite Barack Obama personally campaigning for him. In Georgia and Kentucky, New Southern Democrats Michelle Nunn and Alison Lundergan Grimes were defeated by a political newcomer and Republican incumbent respectively. In Texas, Wendy Davis, hailed in the press as the women who might finally turn Texas blue, had precisely the opposite effect on her state. The state Senate seat she once held will be occupied in January by a pro-life, tea party-friendly Republican woman.\n\n\u201cAny of them could have landed on a vice presidential short list in 2016,\u201d Politico lamented. \u201cInstead, all of them lost.\u201d\n\nJoining them were numerous down-ballot Democrats widely viewed as future contenders for high office: attorney general candidates in Nevada and Arizona who looked like future governors; aspiring state treasurers in Ohio and Colorado who could have gone on to bigger things; prized secretary of state candidates in Iowa and Kansas as well as countless congressional hopefuls around the country.\n\nIn two consecutive midterms, Republicans have decimated the Democratic Party\u2019s bench of talent, not just on the federal or statewide level but farther down the ballot as well. The GOP now controls 69 of the nation\u2019s 99 legislative chambers, a dramatic reversal, according to Washington Examiner columnist David Freddoso, from 2008 when Barack Obama\u2019s party controlled 62 legislative chambers. The GOP now has the total command of state government \u2013 both chambers of the legislature and the governor\u2019s mansions \u2013 in 23 states, while Democrats command the levers of government in just seven states. In addition to the Republican Party\u2019s 31 governorships, the GOP enjoys the allegiance of 32 lieutenant governors offices and 29 crucial secretaries of state.\n\nThe Democratic Party\u2019s farm team outside of the coasts and some enclaves in the Deep South and the Upper Midwest has been all but wiped out. The party, as The Washington Post\u2019s Dan Balz observed in a must-read column, is at risk of being seen as a rapidly aging one.\n\n\u201cThink of it this way,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIf Clinton were to win the presidency and serve two terms, the next opportunity for a new generation of Democrats to compete nationally would not come until 2024.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Democrats could go 16 years between competitive presidential nomination contests, wiping out opportunities for today\u2019s younger generation to define or redefine the party apart from either the Obama or Clinton eras,\u201d Balz continued.\n\nAccording to national exit polling, Republicans improved with the voters aged 18-29 who turned out by 2 points over the party\u2019s 2010 standing. The GOP only lost young voters to Democrats by an atypically close single-digit margin. Moreover, the GOP continues to elevate a younger generation of leaders to high office, including the youngest woman to serve in the House in history, 30-year-old Representative-elect Elise Stefanik (R-NY) who had the added privilege of turning her Empire State district from blue to red. She will replace Rep. Aaron Schock (R-IL) who, at 33-years-old, will soon only be the second youngest House member.\n\nThe Democratic officeholders who survived the routings of 2010 and 2014 are primarily entrenched incumbents and are invariably of an older set. The Democratic Party is rapidly becoming a political organization that, as liberals once said of the GOP, does not look like the constituents it seeks to represent.\n\nBalz further notes that the last competitive Democratic presidential primary, an energizing spectacle which Democrats are unlikely to have in 2016, featured a number of names that have long ago shuffled off the national stage.\n\nThe last competitive nomination campaign, in 2008, included \u2014 in addition to Obama and Clinton \u2014 an experienced field: then-senators Joe Biden, Christopher Dodd and John Edwards, and then-governor Bill Richardson. Clinton has been on the national stage for two decades. Biden, who might run if Clinton does not, was elected to the Senate four decades ago. Dodd and Richardson are out of office. Edwards is in disgrace. With the obvious exceptions, that field has disappeared.\n\nAnd who might challenge Clinton in 2016? Maryland\u2019s Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley has been repudiated by his deep blue state\u2019s voters. California Gov. Jerry Brown, 76, won his first statewide office during the Nixon administration. Andrew Cuomo, who Balz dismisses as unable to remove himself from Clinton\u2019s shadow, is despised by his party\u2019s left-wing. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) is a septuagenarian socialist.\n\nBy contrast, the GOP has a slate of young, energetic federal and statewide office holders and a number of two-term governors now who have consistently demonstrated their ability to withstand Democratic attacks. One which should send shivers down the left\u2019s collective spines is Ohio\u2019s John Kasich. The Buckeye State\u2019s governor won his reelection by the second-largest margin in its history, but his state\u2019s voters have also seen fit to give the GOP near total command of the state under Kasich\u2019s watch.\n\nOhio is an interesting case study of the fortunes of the two parties. It has been ground zero in presidential campaigns for years. Obama won it twice \u2014 but at the state level, Republicans are firmly in control. GOP candidates have won all the statewide elected offices there in five of the past six elections.\n\nThe party maintains a strong bench of talent on the coasts and in America\u2019s urban centers, but Democratic strategists are right to fret that those future recruits may not have the crossover appeal in purple states that center-left candidates otherwise would.\n\nWhen Barack Obama took office, he was hailed as a liberal savior. His presidency, it was believed, would usher in a new era of progressive dominance not seen since Roosevelt. Instead, Republicans have been restored to a position of power across the country they had not known since Al Smith lost 40 states to Herbert Hoover. Far from revitalizing it, Obama has erased generations of the Democratic Party\u2019s progress.\n\nAn earlier version of this article indicated Nunn lost to an incumbent. Senator-elect David Perdue ran for an open seat in Georgia. Stefanik was also identified in an earlier version of this article as the youngest person to be elected to the House.\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "Wasteland.", "title": "A generation of Democrats lost in the Obama era", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2014/11/09/surveying-the-wreckage-the-obama-era-has-sacrificed-a-generation-of-democrats/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary", "creator": "@JazzShaw"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "article": {"published_time": "2014-11-09T20:31:23+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-11-10T18:13:20+00:00"}, "keywords": "2010, 2014, Barack Obama, Democrats, Hillary Clinton,", "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "article_summary": "A generation of Democrats lost in the Obama eraposted at 3:31 pm on November 9, 2014 by Noah RothmanThe scale of the Democratic Party\u2019s losses over the course of the Barack Obama era is becoming clear, and they are vast.\nFar from revitalizing it, Obama has erased generations of the Democratic Party\u2019s progress.\nThe Democratic Party\u2019s farm team outside of the coasts and some enclaves in the Deep South and the Upper Midwest has been all but wiped out.\nIn two consecutive midterms, Republicans have decimated the Democratic Party\u2019s bench of talent, not just on the federal or statewide level but farther down the ballot as well.\nThe GOP only lost young voters to Democrats by an atypically close single-digit margin."}
