Many are still scrambling to get coverage by Jan. 1.\n\nIn the meantime, we\u2019re now beginning to see the taxes added on by insurance companies because of the law.\n\nDavid Rosenberg starts a new job next month, but said he needs insurance until then.\n\n\u201cMy current coverage ends on Jan. 1. I\u2019m covered through the end of this year, that\u2019s when it ends. And my next coverage doesn\u2019t start until Jan. 20,\u201d Rosenberg told CBS 2\u2019s Dick Brennan on Thursday.\n\nBut the disastrous roll-out of the Affordable Care Act has forced the administration to be very flexible with deadlines. The following was posted on its website:\n\n\u201cSometimes, despite your best efforts, you might have run into delays. Don\u2019t worry, we still may be able to help you get covered as soon as Jan. 1.\u201d\n\nBut for many ready to sign up, that just adds to the confusion and concern.\n\n\u201cThey wanna know how they are gonna pay, and what insurance is going to cover,\u201d said Odalys Arevalo of Sunshine Light and Health.\n\nAnd there\u2019s more: most insurance companies don\u2019t tell you about the taxes they add to their premiums. The numbers will vary, but one subscriber said their tax amount is $23.14 a month, or nearly $278 annually.\n\nOther add-ons include:\n\n* A 2 percent premium tax on every health plan.\n\n* A user fee of 3.5 percent to sell through the online marketplace.\n\n* A $2-per-policy fee.\n\nNonetheless, supporters of the Affordable Care Act claim the neediest will get the best coverage.\n\n\u201cPeople who make a little more will pay more; people who make a little less will pay less,\u201d Arevalo said.\n\nCritics say most insurers don\u2019t specifically post taxes on invoices, and some question how, in the case Brennan showed earlier, Alabama Blue Cross-Blue Shield was able to be so specific.\n\nYou May Also Be Interested In These Stories", "article_metadata": {"description": "Time is running out to sign up for Obamacare.
