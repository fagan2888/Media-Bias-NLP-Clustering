Now he has.\n\nFresno Democrat Perea, 38, will be a senior director of state advocacy for the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA). That didn\u2019t come as a huge shock to the Sacramento Bee, which noted when Perea announced his impending resignation that he was one of the top beneficiaries of Big Pharma contributions in 2013 and 2014 and a possible candidate for a job there.\n\nBy law, Perea cannot directly lobby his former colleagues for a year. But he will still be a busy man. The industry has already socked away $23 million to fight a November 2016 ballot measure that will \u201cprohibit state agencies from paying more for a prescription drug than the lowest price paid for the same drug by the United States Department of Veterans Affairs.\u201d\n\nThe VA pays about 20% less for drugs than California by leveraging its ginourmous buying power. The agency is also required by the law to keep prices low. The California Drug Price Relief Initiative would reduce costs for state retirees, AIDS patients, many Medi-Cal recipients and prisons.\n\nFive million people could be affected. So might pharmaceutical industry profits. The initiative passed its signature count and was cleared for qualification a week ago.\n\nPerea led a caucus of business-friendly Democrats in the Assembly who wielded significant power on critical issues. They successfully fought to scale back climate change legislation this past session and in 2014 were credited with scuttling legislation that would have helped low-income workers receive decent health care.\n\nAssembly Bill 880 targeted the so-called Walmart Loophole, which let employers dodge requirements in the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) that full-time workers be given health care by trimming their hours just enough to push them into Medi-Cal. One study (pdf) said 310,000 Californians would have benefited.\n\nLawmakers usually wait until the end of their terms before slipping through the revolving door into the lucrative field of corporate lobbying. But the Bee noted that Perea is at least the third to bail early. Senator Michael J. Rubio, a Democrat in Central Valley oil country, left to join Chevron in February 2013. His seat was won by a Republican.\n\nSenator Bill Emmerson (R-Redlands) left in December 2013 to oversee lobbyists at the California Hospital Association.\n\nFresno County is none too pleased that Perea is leaving early. They have to hold a special election to replace him and, in the meantime, the district will go unrepresented in the Assembly for months.\n\nDepending on when the election is held, it will cost taxpayers between $75,000 and $530,000. The county clerk has $7.4 million to spend for the year. \u201cThis is not in our existing budget,\u201d County Clerk Brandi Orth told CalMatters.\n\nAnother initiative that could make it to the November ballot, the California Voters' Right to Know Act, includes a provision that doubles the lobbying ban to two years. It remains to be seen if slowing the revolving door will do much more than prevent dizziness and reduce unfortunate accidents.\n\n\u2013Ken Broder\n\nTo Learn More:\n\nPharmaceutical Industry Group Scoops Up Former Assemblyman Henry Perea (by Melanie Mason, Los Angeles Times)\n\nWhat Happens When a Legislator Quits?
