Mike Coffman of Aurora joined most other House Republicans last week to support doomed legislation that would unravel Obamacare and defund Planned Parenthood for a year.\n\nRep. Ken Buck of Windsor, a member of the staunchly conservative Freedom Caucus, was one of seven House Republicans who voted against the bill, because it did not completely repeal the Affordable Care Act.\n\nCoffman said Planned Parenthood\u2019s abortion practices \u201cfly in the face of human decency.\u201d Buck has said Planned Parenthood showed \u201creckless disregard for the most vulnerable members of our community,\u201d offering a petition on his campaign website that says he\u2019s committed to removing all taxpayer money from the agency.\n\nInstead the bill, which represents the 61st GOP attempt to undermine the president\u2019s signature healthcare bill, would remove the requirement for each American to obtain health insurance.\n\nDemocrats have been taking Coffman to task for months over his Planned Parenthood positions, after he used an ad touting the women\u2019s healthcare provider\u2019s support in a campaign last year, but has since voted repeatedly to defund it this year.\n\n\u201cI strongly support funding traditional women\u2019s health services, like broad access to birth control and contraception especially to poor and underserved communities, through community health centers and other medical partnerships that act and operate in good faith every day,\u201d Coffman said in a statement to The Denver Post Saturday.\n\nHe has joined with anti-abortion Republicans in Washington who said they were outraged by undercover videos released by an anti-abortion group this summer that appeared to show Planned Parenthood executives suggesting an illegal sale of fetal tissue for medical research. Planned Parenthood has vehemently denied wrongdoing and said the videos were edited to be misleading.\n\n\u201cMany longtime supporters of Planned Parenthood are not only shocked by what\u2019s been revealed, but also by Planned Parenthood\u2019s arrogant response,\u201d Coffman said. \u201cUntil they clean up their act, we should fund critical women\u2019s services through the many other community health partners that operate across my district, the state and all across this country in a way that doesn\u2019t fly in the face of human decency.\u201d\n\nThough the budget bill needs only a simple majority of 51 votes in the Senate, where there are 54 Republicans, it has a tough road ahead. Some Senate conservatives \u2014 including presidential candidates Sens. Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio \u2014 also want an all-out repeal of Obamacare \u2014 while a handful of moderates oppose defunding Planned Parenthood.\n\nEven if the bill passes the House and Senate, it would face a certain veto when it lands on the president\u2019s desk. If Congress does not pass a budget that raises the federal $18.1 trillion debt ceiling by Nov. 3, the Treasury Department has said the government will run out of money to pay its bills. Some economists say that could help throw the economy into a tailspin by putting the nation\u2019s credit-worthiness in doubt.\n\n\u201cRepublicans made a promise to America that we would use reconciliation to fully repeal Obamacare, but the legislation we voted on today doesn\u2019t do that,\u201d Buck said on his Twitter account Friday. \u201cThat\u2019s why I voted against the reconciliation bill. We can\u2019t remove a few parts of Obamacare but leave the expensive spending provisions in place. Let\u2019s send a full repeal to the Senate and the President.\u201d\n\nCoffman\u2019s Democratic opponent in next year\u2019s race in Congressional District 6, state Sen. Morgan Carroll of Aurora, was quick to criticize him for the latest Planned Parenthood vote.\n\n\u201cIt is appalling to see people playing political games with women\u2019s lives, bodies and personal freedoms,\u201d Carroll said in a statement Friday.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Mike Coffman votes for budget bill that defunds Planned Parenthood", "title": "Mike Coffman votes for budget bill that defunds Planned Parenthood", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/10/25/mike-coffman-votes-for-budget-bill-that-defunds-planned-parenthood/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151025__Mike-Coffmanp1.jpg", "height": 490}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151025__Mike-Coffmanp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-10-25T14:42:18+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-21T04:28:22+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "\u201cMany longtime supporters of Planned Parenthood are not only shocked by what\u2019s been revealed, but also by Planned Parenthood\u2019s arrogant response,\u201d Coffman said.\nPlanned Parenthood has vehemently denied wrongdoing and said the videos were edited to be misleading.\nTed Cruz and Marco Rubio \u2014 also want an all-out repeal of Obamacare \u2014 while a handful of moderates oppose defunding Planned Parenthood.\nAs a budget deadline looms, U.S. Rep.
