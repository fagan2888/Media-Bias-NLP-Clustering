Read the original article.\n\nThe Conversation .\n\nAccess to safe and effective birth control is part of health care for tens of millions of Americans. The vast majority of Americans view birth control as \u201cmorally acceptable,\u201d and make sharp distinctions between approval for methods of preventing pregnancy, and methods of terminating it.\n\nDespite this, access to birth control has become politicized. Employee health care plans can be exempt from covering it. Organizations that provide affordable access are under threat. And while Democratic candidates Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton support access to contraception, the top three candidates from the Republican Party favor policies that could severely restrict access to contraception.\n\nBernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton at their respective Super Tuesday primary rallies in Burlington, Vermont and in Miami, Florida. Brian Snyder, Javier Galeano/Reuters\n\nWhat the Democratic candidates think about reproductive health\n\nA 2015 Pew Poll indicates that the positions Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton take on birth control and family planning track more closely with public opinion than do the positions articulated by Republican candidates, and by a wide margin.\n\nBoth Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders have strong records in support of access to contraception. In fact, their positions on these issues are nearly identical.\n\nBoth have stated that they view birth control as a right, and as essential health care.\n\nBoth see birth control and access to family planning information as keys to achieving gender equality.\n\nBoth of their campaigns focus on access to birth control via increased funding for Planned Parenthood, expansion of the Affordable Care Act and their early and sustained support for family planning initiatives like \u201cPrevention First.\u201d\n\nClinton and Sanders have both decried the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in Hobby Lobby, which enables employers to refuse to cover birth control in their employee health plans.\n\nBoth favor bills that would make it illegal for pharmacists to refuse to provide access to emergency contraception.\n\nBoth support global family planning initiatives through international partnerships.\n\nThough their positions are stunningly similar, Planned Parenthood opted to endorse Hillary Clinton, citing her record of sponsoring bills that expand access in the United States and abroad, and her early and vocal support of the organization.\n\nDonald Trump waves to supporters at a Super Tuesday campaign rally in Louisville, Kentucky, March 1, 2016. Chris Bergin/Reuters\n\nTrump\u2019s positions aren\u2019t clear\n\nDonald Trump is the front-runner for the Republican nomination. Though he has proclaimed that he \u201ccherishes women\u201d and \u201cwill protect them,\u201d he has also been widely criticized for misogynist statements and behaviors.\n\nTrump\u2019s anti-woman rhetoric may rightfully concern those who advocate for women\u2019s rights. However, it is not clear that Trump\u2019s personal opinions about the value and worth of women translate into any coherent policy regarding birth control and family planning.\n\nIn fact, it is impossible to know Donald Trump\u2019s position on contraception. His campaign website does not have an \u201cIssues\u201d tab for birth control. It does not have a \u201cPosition\u201d tab for anything related to contraception, family planning or reproductive health. Trump\u2019s campaign website also lacks a search function.\n\nRecently, Trump stated that he is pro-life and would defund \u201cthose parts\u201d of Planned Parenthood that perform abortion (in fact no federal funding currently goes to to elective abortion at Planned Parenthood). However, he has acknowledged that Planned Parenthood provides valuable medical help and reproductive care to women who need it, especially in terms of cancer screening.\n\nThough leaders of Planned Parenthood do not believe he would be a friend to their organization, it is unclear that, as president, he would act aggressively to end the organization\u2019s existence.\n\nTrump has also stated, repeatedly, that as president he would repeal the Affordable Care Act and replace it with an unspecified plan that will be \u201cterrific,\u201d and \u201cmuch much better.\u201c His newly announced seven point plan would rely on market forces across state lines to spur competition among health care providers and insurance companies with an eye to increasing access.\n\nReducing funding to Planned Parenthood (even if not defunding it completely) and replacing the ACA both have the potential to gravely disrupt access to birth control for millions of women. However, it is absolutely unclear what a Trump presidency would mean for access to contraception.\n\nMarco Rubio and Ted Cruz walk offstage at the conclusion of the Republican U.S. presidential candidates' debate, sponsored by CNN on February 25, 2016. Mike Stone/Reuters\n\nCruz and Rubio\n\nTrump\u2019s lack of clarity on the issue is disturbing. And it stands in contrast to the rather clear stances held by the the other two Republican candidates still viable in the presidential race: Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio.\n\nTed Cruz and Marco Rubio have both said in several forums that that they do not support a ban on contraceptives. But the policies that they do support, if enacted, would place significant barriers around access to them.\n\nThey have both supported \u201cpersonhood\u201d amendments to state constitutions as well as the federal constitution. These amendments variously state that life begins at fertilization, or conception, and in some cases define the fertilized egg as a person.\n\nSuch language could have the effect of banning the intrauterine device (IUD) due to the false belief that it causes abortion, rather than provides contraception \u2013 because IUDs in some instances prevent fertilized eggs from implanting. This is troubling because IUDs are the most effective long-term, reversible form of birth control on the market. These \u201cPersonhood Amendments\u201d could also limit access to emergency contraception via the Plan B pill.\n\nIf access to birth control via state-funded health care, private insurance and Planned Parenthood are dramatically constrained by policies made during a Cruz or Rubio presidency, laws banning contraception would not be necessary.\n\nBy creating insurmountable burdens on access, Americans could find themselves living with a de facto ban on access to contraception.\n\nRenee Cramer, Professor of Law, Politics and Society, Drake University", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "where, do, 2016, presidential, candidates, stand, contraception", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Democratic candidates support access to contraception, while candidates from the Republican Party favor policies that could severely restrict access to contraception.", "title": "Where Do The 2016 Presidential Candidates Stand On Contraception?", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/presidential-candidates-birth-control-hillary-clinton-bernie-sanders-donald-377566", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2016/03/11/hillary-clinton.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Democratic candidates support access to contraception, while candidates from the Republican Party favor policies that could severely restrict access to contraception.", "title": "Where Do The 2016 Presidential Candidates Stand On Contraception?", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/presidential-candidates-birth-control-hillary-clinton-bernie-sanders-donald-377566", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2016/03/11/hillary-clinton.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2016/03/11/hillary-clinton.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Opinion", "published_time": "2016-03-13T09:00:00-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-03-13T09:00:02-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Democratic candidates support access to contraception, while candidates from the Republican Party favor policies that could severely restrict access to contraception."}, "article_summary": "And while Democratic candidates Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton support access to contraception, the top three candidates from the Republican Party favor policies that could severely restrict access to contraception.\nRecently, Trump stated that he is pro-life and would defund \u201cthose parts\u201d of Planned Parenthood that perform abortion (in fact no federal funding currently goes to to elective abortion at Planned Parenthood).\nThis is troubling because IUDs are the most effective long-term, reversible form of birth control on the market.\nIt does not have a \u201cPosition\u201d tab for anything related to contraception, family planning or reproductive health.\nBoth have stated that they view birth control as a right, and as essential health care."}
