The amount could go to $3,000 if an employer offers coverage that fails to meet the law\u2019s affordability and minimum essential coverage mandates, and if an employee then goes to the public health exchange at healthcare.gov to buy coverage on their own and qualifies for a federal subsidy.\n\nThe employer mandate in the law expands in 2016 to require employers with 50 or more FTEs to offer ACA-compliant health benefits to at least 95 percent of employees and their dependents under 26 years old. The exclusion from the penalty also changes in 2016 to the first 30 employees. The federal government put the penalty on hold for one year for companies with 50 to 99 FTEs, provided they meet certain conditions.\n\nThe penalty does not apply to employers with 49 or fewer employees.\n\nMarti Lolli, the director of health care reform at Priority Health, expects that employers that have been following the ACA and adjusting their health benefits accordingly shouldn\u2019t have any issue with the penalty.\n\n\u201cBy and large, most employers that we offer coverage to did not have to make drastic changes to their benefits or to whom they offer it to comply with this piece of the law,\u201d Lolli said.\n\nWhere employers will surely feel an administrative burden from the ACA in 2015 is in its reporting requirement.\n\nUnder the federal health reform law, employers in 2016 must begin reporting information to the Internal Revenue Service that includes which employees were enrolled in health benefits each month, which were not, and the costs of the plan. Employers must use data from the preceding year, meaning they need to start tracking it in 2015.\n\n\u201cThis year, employers need to understand what information they need to track and collect and to adjust their systems and processes to begin collecting that so in 2016 they\u2019re ready to go,\u201d Lolli said.\n\nBenefits consultants expect that the reporting requirement could become a big headache for employers.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a whole new cottage industry with the payroll companies and others popping up now to try and help employers with the problem and how they\u2019re going to submit the data,\u201d said Bob Hughes, president of Advantage Benefits Group Inc. in Grand Rapids. \u201cIt\u2019s ridiculous what HR people are going to have to do now going forward.\u201d\n\nIn fact, Lolli said she\u2019s talked to many clients whose systems \u201cjust don\u2019t even handle or accommodate the level of information the IRS is requesting. So there are some process and system upgrades that will need to be made.\u201d\n\nThe IRS will use data from the reporting to check compliance with the ACA, to see if employers meet coverage and affordability mandates, and to determine if they are subject to penalties.\n\nJim Kenyon, a client executive at Hylant Group in Grand Rapids, doubts that many employers are even aware of the reporting requirement. He suspects they may have overlooked it.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been asking my customers, \u2018Who\u2019s your payroll service? Ask them this question: Are you going to be prepared to help me with reporting?\u2019\u201d Kenyon said.\n\nThe ACA has added a whole new layer of complexity for employers in managing their employee health benefits, said Kirk Roy, vice president of national health reform at Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan. Prior to the ACA, employers primarily only had to worry about what type of health plan to offer each year, their deductible and copay levels, and how much of the premium they paid versus how much the employees have to pay.\n\nNow they need to worry about those decisions and how they square with the requirements of the law, Roy said.\n\n\u201cThere always will be, forever more, this new dimension to figure out: \u2018What does what I am doing mean in terms of all of those penalties, reporting and other stuff?\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s just new and big and it\u2019s burdensome administratively and it also makes the decision-making much more complicated.\u201d\n\nDespite the complications and the increased administrative burden of complying with the law, few employers have so far chosen to drop employee health benefits altogether.\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t seen a real inflection point still. Some employers are saying, \u2018I\u2019m done,\u2019 but there\u2019s not a big domino effect or a rush to get out of the business,\u201d Roy said. \u201cWe haven\u2019t seen them just throw in the towel yet.\u201d\n\nThat could change, however, in another year when the penalty toughens and employers need to offer ACA-compliant coverage to 95 percent of FTEs, said benefits attorney John Arendshorst of the Grand Rapids office of Varnum LLP.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to see a lot of employers consider this again going into 2016,\u201d Arendshorst said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a different question of whether to provide benefits.\u201d\n\nWhen considering that question, whether now or in the future, employers need to consider how dropping health benefits may affect their ability to retain and recruit employees. If they look at it simply from the financial question, \u201cfor some employers that might be the best option, to not offer coverage and pay the penalties,\u201d Arendshorst said. \u201cThat might be less than what they have to shell out for coverage.\u201d\n\nAnother change the ACA brings in 2015 is an increase in the penalty for people who do not have health coverage, in violation of the law\u2019s individual mandate. The penalty is $325 or 2.0 percent of family income, whichever is greater. That\u2019s up from $95 per adult and $162.50 per child currently.\n\nEmployers with 25 or fewer employees can use the online SHOP exchange (Small Business Health Options Program) to purchase health benefits and seek federal tax credits that have been available since 2010. Roy said he\u2019s seen \u201calmost no\u201d interest in the SHOP exchange among small employers.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The new year rings in two major requirements for employers to follow under the federal Affordable Care Act.
