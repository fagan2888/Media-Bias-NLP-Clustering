Most of them, including his sister, were slaughtered in the first week of the 20th century\u2019s final genocide.\n\nThis week, Rwanda began commemorating the 20 years that have passed since the mass murder of Tutsis and moderate Hutus, which continued for 100 days and left at least 800,000 dead.\n\nGathering in a packed soccer stadium in Kigali, Rwandans re-enacted the horrific events of 1994. President Paul Kagame said his country had \u201ca reason to celebrate the normal moments of life, that are easy for others to take for granted.\"\n\nWhen Gahigi returned to Rwanda after the genocide, he had nothing: no family, no home. Eventually, he moved past his anger and entered a Christian seminary.\n\nIn 1999, he began visiting Rilima Prison in Bugesera, the new home to thousands of the g\u00e9nocidaires, the men who wielded the machetes. In Rilima he met the band of 15 who killed his sister.\n\nAt first, the prisoners thought he had been sent by the government \u2013 a spy in a clerical collar \u2013 to investigate their crimes. Even when they were satisfied that Gahigi wasn\u2019t a spy, they were skeptical of his motives. Why would this man come to their prison to preach when he knew what they had done?\n\nBut one of Gahigi\u2019s messages resonated: It was possible for perpetrators to be forgiven. More g\u00e9nocidaires began attending his teachings, including the band of 15. He became their pastor.\n\nWhile researching a book about prison chaplains a few years ago, I visited Kigali and spoke to pastors like Gahigi.\n\nAccording to the Rev. Deogratias Gashagaza, executive director of Prison Fellowship Rwanda, there are 36,000 genocide perpetrators still serving time in one of Rwanda\u2019s 13 prisons. That\u2019s down from a high of 130,000 in 1998, according to Human Rights Watch.\n\nFifteen of Prison Fellowship Rwanda\u2019s 35 chaplain volunteers had family members murdered during the genocide.\n\nWhen Gahigi returned after the genocide, he met Bishop John Rucyahana, a former Anglican bishop and current president of the country\u2019s National Unity and Reconciliation Commission, which was established in 1999 with the goal of \u201creconstructing the Rwandan identity.\u201d\n\n\u201cI knew that to really minister to Rwanda's needs meant working toward reconciliation in the prisons, in the churches, and in the cities and villages throughout the country,\u201d Rucyahana wrote in his book, \u201cThe Bishop of Rwanda.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt meant feeding the hungry, sheltering the homeless, caring for the young, but it also meant healing the wounded and forgiving the unforgivable.\u201d\n\nRwanda is overwhelmingly Christian: 50% Catholic and about 44% Protestant and other Christian traditions. The tensions that led to the genocide were between ethnic groups, with the majority Hutu largely acting against the minority Tutsi.\n\nScholars have since written that Christian leaders aided in the genocide by giving moral support to the perpetrators\u2019 cause.\n\nForgiveness on the scale suggested by Rucyahana was difficult for Gahigi, even after he graduated from seminary.\n\n\u201cMy people died innocently,\u201d he would tell himself. \u201cWhy should I have to go and help the people who killed them?\u201d\n\nEventually Gahigi came to see his own survival as a calling. Instructions came, he said, in his sleep.\n\nHe had a dream about a mob beating Jesus as he hung on the cross. A voice told Gahigi, \u201cThose people beating Jesus are the ones Jesus helped. They killed your countrymen and your family, but you can help them.\u201d\n\nWhen he woke up, he was crying.\n\n\u201cI cried all night, but when the crying stopped, I felt light and love,\u201d Gahigi said.\n\nHe believed then that he had the power to forgive and to help others forgive. He began preaching reconciliation, and he sought out the prisoners who killed his family.\n\n\u201cThat was Jesus\u2019 mission,\u201d Gahigi told me. \u201cTo forgive the sins of all men.\u201d\n\nThe wrong question\n\nOne of the most horrifying of Rwanda\u2019s genocide memorial sites is in a small, red brick church building outside Kigali in the Bugesera district.\n\nTwenty years ago this Tuesday, Hutu government-backed Interahamwe paramilitary troops arrived at a Catholic church in Ntarama and slaughtered more than 5,000 people who had barricaded themselves inside.\n\nThe annihilation of the Tutsi had been underway for more than a week.\n\nFor 10 years after the genocide, the victims\u2019 bodies lay where they had fallen inside the church. Visitors to the Ntarama memorial had to jump from pew to pew to avoid the dead.\n\nIn 2011, I visited Ntarama with then-U.S. Ambassador to Rwanda Stuart Symington, and U.S. Ambassador-at-Large for War Crimes Issues Stephen Rapp.\n\nOur guide told us that those who were murdered had come to the church because they believed they would be safe.\n\n\u201cMost Christians didn\u2019t understand at the time that they could be killed in a church,\u201d he said.\n\nEventually, their bones were moved to a large rack at the back of the church. There were shelves for hundreds of skulls, and others for hundreds of femurs. Shoes were stacked by the altar.\n\nClothing hung from the building\u2019s rafters and along its walls. Rags orange from years of Rwandan dust lined the floors between pews where they once clothed bodies.\n\nA famous quote that has come to sum up Rwanda\u2019s two-decade effort at reconciliation was printed on a purple and white banner and strung across the sanctuary: \u201cIf you knew me and you really knew yourself, you would not have killed me.\u201d\n\nOutside the church, near a giant hole in one wall where the perpetrators broke through, chickens pecked the red ground.\n\nBoth Symington and Rapp had been to Ntarama before. Prior to his appointment to lead the State Department\u2019s war crimes office in 2009, Rapp was a prosecutor for the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR).\n\nHe leaned down to wipe dirt from the blade of a machete, like the bones inside, left where it landed 20 years ago.\n\nAs our group continued on ahead of us, I asked Rapp what massacre sites like Ntarama meant to him, as someone who had worked for years to bring justice to the dead.\n\nWe were standing outside a church, after all. Where was God when this massacre was taking place?\n\n\u201cIn my mind\u2019s eye, I picture the bricks giving way and the people inside just waiting to die and I imagine the screams,\u201d Rapp said. \u201cBut I never heard, in any of the recounting of what happened here, about people begging not to die.\u201d\n\nHe paused, still moving dirt with his shoe.\n\n\u201cAsking where God was in all this is the wrong question,\u201d he continued. \u201cThe right question is, \u2018Where was man?\u2019\u201d\n\nThe Nazis' chaplains\n\nAt the time of my visit to Rwanda, much of the prison chaplains\u2019 work was funded by Norwegian Church Aid, which has its roots in the immediate aftermath of the Second World War.\n\nIn October 1945, as the world was confronting evidence of another genocide, Norway\u2019s churches organized a way to share food aid coming into former Allied countries \u2013 France, the Netherlands, Belgium, Greece \u2013 with the destitute German people.\n\nOne month later, in Nuremberg, the Allies shared something else with Germans.\n\nThe U.S. Army assigned two of its own chaplains to minister to Hitler\u2019s lieutenants, then on trial in the destroyed city\u2019s Palace of Justice.\n\nThe Rev. Henry Gerecke, a Lutheran minister from St. Louis, and the Rev. Sixtus O\u2019Connor, a Catholic priest from upstate New York, were asked to kneel down with the architects of the Holocaust and minister to them as they answered to the world for crimes against humanity.\n\nAmong them were Hermann Goering, Hans Frank, Ernst Kaltenbrunner, Rudolf Hess: 21 Nazis in all.\n\nBoth American chaplains served during the war, and each had seen the Germans' crimes up close in the months since VE Day.\n\nGerecke had been to Dachau several times while stationed with the 98th General Hospital in Munich over the summer of 1945.\n\nO\u2019Connor had helped liberate Austria\u2019s Mauthausen concentration camp in May 1945 as a chaplain with the 11th Armored Division. He conducted nearly 3,000 burial services in three weeks there.\n\nThat these two chaplains then spent a year in the Nuremberg prison, hoping to bring Nazis back to the Christian faith before they were executed, repulsed many Americans.\n\nThe concept of forgiveness in Christianity and Judaism is very different, but in both traditions the act of returning the wrongdoer to the good is central.\n\nIn Judaism that return requires the repentance of the wrongdoer and the participation \u2013 the forgiveness \u2013 of the person who was wronged.\n\nJustice, as Princeton University scholar Leora Batnitzky has said, may be the supreme Jewish virtue. If the wrong committed was murder, forgiveness is impossible \u2013 from the murdered, but also from God.\n\nChristian tradition says forgiveness precedes repentance.\n\nChristians believe God has already forgiven them, atoned for their sins in the crucifixion of Jesus. But that concept must be strained by genocide.\n\nCould Christians really believe that their God died to forgive those who conceived of a place like Mauthausen, where 100,000 people were tortured and murdered between 1939 and 1945?\n\nOr like another church near Kigali, in Nyamata, where nearly 11,000 people barricaded themselves before the Interahamwe penetrated the walls, and where spattered blood still streaks the altar cloth.\n\nHow could Gerecke forgive Goering, who put Hitler\u2019s \u201cfinal solution\u201d into place?\n\nHow could Gahigi forgive the 15 men who killed his sister using what he called \u201cfarming equipment\u201d?\n\nThe answer is that these chaplains weren\u2019t personally forgiving evil, but attempting a transformation. The evil deed isn\u2019t forgiven. But, these chaplains believed, an evildoer can be returned from darkness to the good of his own light.\n\n'Kill him after'\n\nThe chaplains of Prison Fellowship Rwanda have been attempting that transformation for nearly 20 years.\n\nLike Gahigi, Gashagaza was out of the country during the genocide. When he returned home, his community was gone: 25 family members murdered.\n\nHis sister, her husband and their seven children had been killed. Like Gahigi, he was confused and angry.\n\n\u201cI was thinking, \u2018Why?\u2019\u201d he said. \u201c\u2019Why did people die like animals? How and why?\u2019\u201d\n\nA year later, Gashagaza was one of the first pastors to go into a Rwandan prison, this one in Butare in southern Rwanda near the Burundi border, and filled with 15,000 g\u00e9nocidaires. He was convinced God would protect him.\n\n\u201cSo, I entered the prison, and the prisoners said, \u2018Oh! How a guy like this man is still alive? Why did he not die? Kill him now!\u2019\u201d Gashagaza recounted.\n\n\u201cOne said, \u2018Please, let him finish his preaching. Kill him after.\u2019 Inside my heart, I have a quiet prayer: \u2018God, you are the one who sent me here. Protect me. This is not easy.\u2019\u201d\n\nGashagaza said he thought of Jesus on the cross.\n\n\u201cHe said, \u2018I forgive those who betrayed me, those who killed me.\u2019 I gave them this message, and I told them, \u2018Even though you are perpetrators of genocide, God still loves you. He needs your heart. He needs your change.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe prison chaplains have also led an effort at reconciliation \u2013 a series of discussions between g\u00e9nocidaires and survivors on topics such as confession, forgiveness and repentance.\n\nIf it\u2019s obvious what the perpetrators get out of such meetings, it\u2019s more difficult to understand how a survivor would benefit. In the end, the answer is surprisingly simple.\n\n\u201cSleep,\u201d Gashagaza told me. \u201cExperiencing forgiveness gives peace.\u201d\n\nTim Townsend is the author of \u201cMission at Nuremberg: An American Army Chaplain and the Trial of the Nazis,\u201d which was published last month.", "article_metadata": {"description": "By Tim Townsend, special to CNN (CNN)\u00a0-- When the killing began in earnest, Steven Gahigi\u00a0fled his home in the Bugesera district of Rwanda to neighboring Burundi.
