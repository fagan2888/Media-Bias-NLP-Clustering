For example, working as an insurance claims adjuster, managing a clothing department at Macy\u2019s or teaching grade school.Too many end up loaded with debt and selling smart phones, serving coffee or no job at all.For high school graduates, conditions are even worse. Most don\u2019t qualify for burgeoning opportunities in medical, technology and other fields.Consequently, 23 million adults between 25 and 54\u2014too old for college and too young to be retired\u2014are neither working nor looking for work. They simply live off relatives and government benefits.With robots having the potential to replace 90 percent of all occupations \u2014from carpenters to dentists by 2030, the enormous challenge of preparing most Americans for meaningful and decent paying work is only beginning.America no longer has a cultural or political center\u2014the white, Christian, two-parent family aspiring to suburban serenity and accomplishing middle-class security\u2014is fast becoming a minority. That\u2019s why John Kasich prevails only in Ohio and Ted Cruz cannot win primaries outside a few southern and western-rural states or quite white Wisconsin.Campaign talk of tax cuts, free trade, bans on abortion and gay marriage, and repealing Obamacare may appeal to the keepers of right-wing orthodoxy at the annual Conservative Political Action Conference but simply has little resonance with voters earning too little to pay meaningful federal income taxes, or afford more expensive necessities at Wal-Mart, a decent home or health insurance without a $5000 deductible.History teaches that frustrated expectations and rising inequality\u2014falling average family incomes alongside twenty-something Wall Street traders and software developers earning vast sums\u2014is a highly combustible combination. The man on the white horse usually provides the match\u2014often in the form of nationalism and scapegoats.Enter Donald Trump with tough talk\u2014and little substance\u2014about leveling the playing field with China, closing the border with Mexico, banning Muslim immigration and rude remarks about successful women. Those appeal to economically disenfranchised white males and women who depend on them, and who compose just enough of Republican primary voters to give him a plurality of delegates in Cleveland.Hillary Clinton has demagoguery of her own to cobble a majority in the general election. Appealing to disparate fragments of the voters by defending affirmative action\u2014which sentences blacks to dependency on liberal white politicians\u2014offering debt free college\u2014which would do little to fix college curriculums that don\u2019t impart marketable skills\u2014and promising to destroy an already fast disappearing gender gap in opportunity \u2014 young women are getting 60 percent of the college degrees and often earn more than young men.Clinton rallies supporters to end white male preference, while Trump seeks to resurrect it.Neither, if elected, will take the country forward\u2014just leave it more disaffected and divided\u2014but the Republican establishment remain clueless and indifferent to the ground shifting beneath its feet.is an economist and business professor at the University of Maryland, and a national columnist.
