WILKES-BARRE TWP. â€” Geisinger Health Plan will open a retail site in the Wilkes-Barre Township Marketplace between Radio Shack and Sweet Frog in October, according to spokeswoman Lisa Hartman.

The retail site will allow people to come in and ask questions or enroll in a plan, she said. The site will also have self-serve computers, educational programs and screenings.

Geisinger officials decided to open the office in response to the Affordable Care Act, which mandated people enroll in a qualified health plan.
