But it\u2019s already a defining campaign issue \u2014 and like the Iraq War and Obamacare votes last decade, looks likely to remain a stark dividing line in many election cycles to come.\n\nRepublicans are plotting to make Democrats pay dearly for backing an agreement the GOP argues hinges on an historic enemy of the United States playing nice. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell plans to return to the floor next week to force Democrats to take more votes Republicans say they'll regret as soon as Iran violates the terms of the deal or sponsors terrorist attacks, which critics believe is just a matter of time.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nAfter that will come the attack ads, national GOP officials say. It\u2019s expected to be a key cog of Republicans\u2019 electoral strategy: some GOP senators are already comparing it to Obamacare in its scope and potential to damage Democratic supporters politically.\n\n\u201cIt will be very harmful to their chances,\u201d said National Republican Senatorial Committee Chairman Roger Wicker of Mississippi.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what else the Democrats could do to chase the pro-Israel community in the United States any further in the Republican direction,\u201d said Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Texas), a former NRSC chairman. \u201cThis is the same mistake they made on the Affordable Care Act. They made this a partisan issue.\u201d\n\nDemocrats acknowledge the political risk of the vote \u2014 42 Democrats successfully filibustered a resolution to scuttle the Iran deal \u2014 but say Republicans are overplaying their hand. If the agreement succeeds in curbing Iran's nuclear program, the GOP effort will at the very least fizzle, they say, if not hurt Republicans for opposing a move toward peace.\n\nOnly one vulnerable Democratic senator is up in 2016, Michael Bennet of Colorado, who supported the deal. Most Democratic Senate challengers, however, have also lined up in favor of the agreement. Within minutes of Thursday's vote, the GOP's Senate campaign arm sent out news releases blasting Democrats who sided with the president.\n\nThe bigger political aftershocks may come in 2018, when a host of Democrats\u2019 in conservative-leaning states will be up for reelection.\n\nBut the GOP strategy largely relies on the Iran agreement failing spectacularly. Democrats acknowledge they cast a risky vote but say that Republicans almost seem to be hoping for something bad to happen in order to reap the political benefits.\n\n\u201cWhat did Republicans do on the Affordable Care Act? They did everything in their power to undermine it so that it would fail and become a political issue for them,\u201d said Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), who played a major role rounding up Democratic votes for the deal. \u201cIt\u2019s one thing to play around with national healthcare, it\u2019s another thing to play around with national security for political gain.\u201d\n\nIn interviews, red-state Democrats who are up for reelection in 2018 and supported the deal acknowledged they didn\u2019t make their reelection campaigns any easier by following Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid\u2019s filibuster.\n\n\u201cIf I wanted to simply play it safe, the decision would have been completely different,\u201d said Sen. Heidi Heitkamp (D-N.D.). \u201cOne of the biggest problems in this town is everyone puts their finger to the wind and says \u2018which way is easy?\u2019\u201d\n\nSen. Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.) accused Republicans of politicizing the Iran fight and said the GOP is misjudging its ability to use the vote against her.\n\n\u201cI believe that as time passes, it will become clearer and clearer that this was the right thing to do,\u201d she said.\n\nRed-state Democrats did not vote in lockstep. Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) was leaning toward supporting the deal this summer, only to encounter a torrent of opposition when he barnstormed his conservative state.\n\nManchin said when he tried to parry his constituents\u2019 arguments against the Iran deal, he found that he \u201ccould not explain how we\u2019re going to rein in a 36-year terrorist operation.\u201d But he insisted he didn\u2019t oppose the deal for political considerations in West Virginia, where opposition to most things associated with President Obama is sky-high.\n\n\u201cThe smart move would have been for me to announce immediately I\u2019m opposed to it,\u201d Manchin said. \u201cIf you\u2019re playing politics, it\u2019s a no-brainer. Why would anyone put themselves through the agony I went through?\u201d\n\nManchin\u2019s deliberations stand in contrast to Republican senators facing voters next fall, many of whom came out against the Iran deal hours or days after it was announced in June.\n\nDemocrats say there\u2019s an opportunity for them, too, to make something of what they call the GOP\u2019s reflexive opposition to the agreement. They also point out that GOP incumbents running for reelection signed on to a controversial letter to Iranian leadership earlier this year that was seen as unprecedented congressional meddling in the president\u2019s foreign policy.\n\n\u201cVoters will remember that Republicans were more interested in scoring political points than in having a serious discussion and their reckless letter to the Ayatollah made that absolutely clear,\u201d said Sadie Weiner, a spokeswoman for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee.\n\nStill, even some of the most strident critics of the Iran deal seemed worried about appearing overly focused on the agreement\u2019s politics. Sen. Mark Kirk (R-Ill.) has argued that the deal with Iran is a capitulation in a league with Neville Chamberlain\u2019s strategy with the Nazis. But asked if Democratic opponents Andrea Zopp and Rep. Tammy Duckworth might regret their backing for the deal, Kirk excused himself from the conversation.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to make news today,\u201d he said.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "Democrats counter that Republicans are overplaying their hand.", "title": "GOP aims to make Democrats pay politically for Iran vote", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/09/iran-deal-senate-vote-democrats-republicans-213524", "image": "http://static.politico.com/dd/ce/e968b10c41cea830927cba2cb246/150910-harry-reid-dick-durbin-iran-gty-1160.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "Democrats counter that Republicans are overplaying their hand.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd877\"", "article_summary": "Still, even some of the most strident critics of the Iran deal seemed worried about appearing overly focused on the agreement\u2019s politics.\naccused Republicans of politicizing the Iran fight and said the GOP is misjudging its ability to use the vote against her.\nBut the GOP strategy largely relies on the Iran agreement failing spectacularly.\nThey made this a partisan issue.\u201dDemocrats acknowledge the political risk of the vote \u2014 42 Democrats successfully filibustered a resolution to scuttle the Iran deal \u2014 but say Republicans are overplaying their hand.\nDemocrats say there\u2019s an opportunity for them, too, to make something of what they call the GOP\u2019s reflexive opposition to the agreement."}
