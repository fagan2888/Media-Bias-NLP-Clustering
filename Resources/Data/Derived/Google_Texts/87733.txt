Despite the highly publicized technical issues that have plagued the government's health insurance exchange website that went live on Oct. 1, Americans' views of the Affordable Care Act are slightly more positive now than they were in August. Forty-five percent now approve of the law, while 50% disapprove, for a net approval score of -5. In June and August, net approval was slightly lower, at -8.

The polls just keep improving for Obamacare. This round, it's Gallup , showing an incremental creep upward for the new law.As pollwatcher points out in this diary, the law is most popular with young adults, the only age group more likely to approve than disapprove of the law. Good news for Obamacare, since the participation of younger, healthier people is critical to the success of the law as a whole.

As in the NBC/WSJ poll from right after the shutdown, the movement in Obamacare approval is coming from the previously undecideds, in this case mostly Democrats (from 71 percent approve/12 percent no opinion to 83 percent approve/2 percent no opinion) and independents, who had a five percent shift towards approval.

Obamcare's 45 percent approval, ever inching upward, is an approval rating congressional Republicans can't even dream about these days.
