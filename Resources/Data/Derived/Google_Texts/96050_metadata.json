A graduate student from Illinois sent me an article that claims the world has too many people. The student called the article \u201cobviously flawed and horrendous. It\u2019s embarrassing that we as a civilization would even consider forced starvation of the developing world in order to reduce their population to \u2018sustainable\u2019 levels. \u2026 How would you answer people who make these claims?\u201d\n\nThis is easy. Overpopulation gurus tend to forget a crucial truth: One mouth brings with it two hands. Fifty years ago, neo-Malthusianism was on the rise in the United States, and that ethos contributed to the legalization of abortion, among other evils. But three developments since then have undercut the theory.\n\nFirst, we\u2019ve seen that predictions of population increase leading to vast starvation were way off: As the lead paragraph in an article published last year put it, \u201cSome of the poorest people in the world are becoming significantly less poor, according to a groundbreaking academic study which has taken a new approach to measuring deprivation. The report, by Oxford University\u2019s poverty and human development initiative, predicts that countries among the most impoverished in the world could see acute poverty eradicated within 20 years if they continue at present rates.\u201d\n\nWe see you\u2019ve been enjoying the content on our exclusive member website.

It says: \u2018The world is witnessing a epochal \u201cglobal rebalancing\u201d with higher growth in at least 40 poor countries helping lift hundreds of millions out of poverty and into a new \u201cglobal middle class.\u201d Never in history have the living conditions and prospects of so many people changed so dramatically and so fast.\u2019\u201d)\n\nSecond, predictions that we would run out of essential materials were also way off. See The Bet: Paul Ehrlich, Julian Simon, and Our Gamble Over Earth\u2019s Future (2013). As Amazon.com\u2019s summary puts it, \u201cEhrlich, author of the landmark book The Population Bomb, predicted that rising populations would cause overconsumption, resource scarcity, and famine\u2014with apocalyptic consequences for humanity. Simon optimistically countered that human welfare would flourish thanks to flexible markets, technological change, and our collective ingenuity.\u201d Simon won.\n\nThird, as the world urbanizes and children\u2019s health improves, women have fewer children, so population is unlikely to keep growing quickly. Among the new books that explore this is Jonathan Last\u2019s What to Expect When No One\u2019s Expecting (2014), which is largely about the United States but also summarizes world trends: Population growth has been slowing for two generations and, if present trends continue, world population in several decades will begin shrinking.\n\nSo, don\u2019t pay attention to Chicken Little squeals. Population growth is not a bad thing when people are free to work, achieve, and explore the world for stuff that\u2019s useful. But even if worriers do not value such evidence, the sky is not falling.
