VuCOMP, Inc., a Texas-based developer of advanced computer vision systems for breast cancer detection, announced that its M-Vu Computer-Aided Detection (CAD) for mammography version 3.1. was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The company also plans to launch an updated version of its CAD station that will include the ability to process additional standard screening views for technicians using the equipment, which the company says will provide faster, enhanced radiology, as well as improved parallel architecture.

The M-Vu CAD system is able to identify areas in a mammogram that may indicate breast cancer, thanks to the use of advanced computer vision algorithms. The first version of the product was approved by the FDA and is already being used in several practices. The device was studied and proved effective in the detection of breast cancer, with one of its advantages for clinicians being the possibility to be used in a variety of digital mammography systems.

VuCOMP has indicated that it will continue to provide updates to its products through aggressive, ongoing research and development of new technologies. “We are committed to the continuous improvement of our product line, and each new release of M-Vu CAD offers advances that provide substantial value to the system and our customers. These latest updates are no exception,” said president and CTO of VuCOMP Jim Pike.

VuCOMP has also recently developed and commercialized M-Vu Breast Density, which was approved by the FDA in December of the last year. Both products are being used in the market, as the company continues to set new standards for CAD and automated breast density measurement.
