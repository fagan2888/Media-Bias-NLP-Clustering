Would anyone vote for that?\u201d\n\nReferring to the Republican party as \u201cthe party of women\u2019s suffrage\u201d (correctly so: The 19th Amendment was largely opposed by Democrats and supported by Republicans), Fiorina\u2019s video definitely struck a raw nerve with Behar, who said:\n\nShe has the nerve to use the term women\u2019s suffrage when she\u2019s against Planned Parenthood and women\u2019s maternity leave. She\u2019s against ObamaCare. She\u2019s anti-choice. She uses the term women\u2019s suffrage. She should be ashamed of herself. It\u2019s not your face honey, it\u2019s your policy.\n\nBased on conservative reactions on Twitter, Fiorina\u2019s headed in the right direction.\n\nJudging from Joy Behar\u2019s rant, the Left is scared of Carly Fiorina\u2026.
