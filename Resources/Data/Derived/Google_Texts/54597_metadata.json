Construction started a year ago.\n\nSome underground issues resulted in a delay of three to four months, according to Moats, who is shooting for opening the first week of July.\n\nDientes\u2019 development director Sheree Storm said nine new employees will be hired to staff the facility: two dentists, a hygienist, four dental assistants, and two front office staff.\n\nEven though Western Dental is still accepting new Denti-Cal patients in Santa Cruz County, \u201cWe still have a systemic problem of not enough dental providers in Santa Cruz County accepting Medi-Cal as compared to the need in our community. The issue has to do with the Medi-Cal reimbursement rates that are available to private dentists.\u201d\n\nBoth Dientes, which expanded its Santa Cruz facility in October, and Salud Para La Gente, which has a team of nine dentists in Watsonville, have the status of a \u201cfederally qualified health center.\u201d\n\nSuch facilities averaged a reimbursement of $164 per Denti-Cal patient visit in 2012 compared to the $22 average for common procedures done by dentists in private practice.", "article_metadata": {"description": "WATSONVILLE >> Recruiting of staff is underway for a new dental clinic nearing completion \u2013and funded by the Affordable Care Act \u2013 to serve low-income families.\u201cIf not for the Affordable Care Act, we would not be talk", "title": "New dental clinic to open in Watsonville", "og": {"url": "http://www.santacruzsentinel.com/article/NE/20150601/NEWS/150609984", "image": {"width": "1500px", "identifier": "http://www.santacruzsentinel.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/NE/20150601/NEWS/150609984/AR/0/AR-150609984.jpg?Maxh=1500&Maxw=1500", "height": "1167px"}, "type": "article", "title": "New dental clinic to open in Watsonville"}, "twitter": {"domain": "santacruzsentinel.com", "description": "WATSONVILLE >> Recruiting of staff is underway for a new dental clinic nearing completion \u2013and funded by the Affordable Care Act \u2013 to serve low-income families.\u201cIf not for the Affordable Care Act, we would not be talk", "title": "New dental clinic to open in Watsonville", "url": "http://www.santacruzsentinel.com/article/NE/20150601/NEWS/150609984", "image": {"src": "http://www.santacruzsentinel.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/NE/20150601/NEWS/150609984/AR/0/AR-150609984.jpg?Maxh=900&Maxw=900"}, "site": "@scsentinel", "app": {"id": {"ipad": "id563358177?mt=8", "iphone": "id499677382?mt=8", "googleplay": "com.spreedinc.providers.californianewspaperpartnership.santacruzsentinel"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msvalidate.01": "9DAB14005AD5A9FFA4CA0EF58CC794BA", "keywords": "cityeditor,county Health Services Agency,dental care,Dientes,hcare,health,jondigumz,localnews,topbiz,watsonville, Health", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "cityeditor,county Health Services Agency,dental care,Dientes,hcare,health,jondigumz,localnews,topbiz,watsonville, Health"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcdc31\"", "article_summary": "The county is renovating the building to create a dental clinic and Dientes Community Dental Care, a nonprofit that runs a clinic with 10 dental chairs at 1830 Commercial Way in Santa Cruz, will operate the new location.\nEven though Western Dental is still accepting new Denti-Cal patients in Santa Cruz County, \u201cWe still have a systemic problem of not enough dental providers in Santa Cruz County accepting Medi-Cal as compared to the need in our community.\nWATSONVILLE >> Recruiting of staff is underway for a new dental clinic nearing completion \u2013and funded by the Affordable Care Act \u2013 to serve low-income families.\nSuite C is a former courthouse that dated to the 1930s next to the county health clinic.\nIt represents a new collaboration for providing services and a first in Santa Cruz County."}
