She writes, \"even though I can\u2019t read those tiny little letters on the sheet of paper they hold up, doctors in three states now have concluded my vision is good enough for me to safely drive.\"\n\nThe NY DMV provides a form which allows a person to submit a doctor's evaluation of their ability to drive. Even though Birch had that form, as well as a doctor's thumb's up, she knew she was in for a long hard slog at the most loathed of state bureaucracies because as she notes, \"government workers can still make it difficult for you to get what you\u2019re qualified for under the law.\"\n\nShe provides helpful tips for success in a place where you are literally just a number to the people who work there:\n\nKnow As Much As You Can in Advance\n\nFigure Out As Much As You Can Quickly\n\nUse Keywords\n\nSpeak Directly and Stand Your Ground\n\nFollow Up With the People Who Helped You Out\n\nHer mantra for slaying the beast can be summarized as \"Be nice, know your shit, but don't take any shit.\" But Birch puts it much more politely here:\n\nBottom line: Don\u2019t get pushed around. As much as you can, know what you are and aren\u2019t obligated to do in a given situation. Be open to talking something through, but don\u2019t get bullied into unnecessary hassles.\n\nRead the whole thing here.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "Sometimes you need more than just the law and policy on your side.", "title": "How to Beat the DMV Bureaucracy", "url": "http://reason.com/blog/2016/03/02/how-to-beat-the-dmv-bureaucracy", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14569475042596.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Sometimes you need more than just the law and policy on your side.", "creator": "@anthonylfisher", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14569475042596.jpg", "title": "How to Beat the DMV Bureaucracy", "site": "@reason", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 17548474116}, "google-site-verification": "-AmMiilAN-pnjWt369CUWae-VQ-b9wmH4fSGyhbkQxw", "msvalidate.01": "212A68A07785B3080038A845C4EE8905", "article": {"tag": "Government employees", "published_time": "2016-03-02T20:10:00+00:00", "author": "http://reason.com/people/anthony-l-fisher"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2"}, "article_summary": "The NY DMV provides a form which allows a person to submit a doctor's evaluation of their ability to drive.\nProPublica's tagline declares the site's mission as \"Journalism in the Public Interest,\" and what could be more in the public interest than helping the citizenry beat the unnecessary roadblocks imposed by public employees?\nIn a recently published article, web producer Hannah Birch describes her quest to secure a New York state driver's license despite being medically unable to complete the Department of Motor Vehicle's (DMV) vision exam.\nBe open to talking something through, but don\u2019t get bullied into unnecessary hassles.\nAs much as you can, know what you are and aren\u2019t obligated to do in a given situation."}
