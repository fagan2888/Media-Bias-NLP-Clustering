Now that more than 420,000 Kentuckians have health insurance because of the federal Affordable Care Act, state officials are helping those people find doctors to use that insurance.

A new law that goes into effect Tuesday will give nurse practitioners more authority to prescribe certain medications. Supporters say it will help the state's primary care doctors deal with the influx of new patients.

Nurse practitioners need a collaborative agreement with a doctor in order to prescribe medication. The new law would waive that requirement for nurse practitioners who have had a collaborative agreement for at least four years.

Supporters say the new law will help nurse practitioners open their own practices where they can prescribe blood pressure and cholesterol medicine, antibiotics and even some antidepressants.
