The Broncos\u2019 second-leading receiver moved well in individual drills during practice\u2019s open period.\n\nOutside linebacker DeMarcus Ware (back) returned to the field, but did not practice. Ware was seen in a hoodie and sweatpants stretching on the sidelines with a trainer.\n\nKubiak said Ware was \u201ca little bit better than last week,\u201d but he\u2019s not quite ready to practice yet.\n\nWare has missed three games, including the last two, with the back injury that he termed as \u201cstructural\u201d earlier this month.\n\nGuard Evan Mathis (ankle) also did not practice Wednesday. The Broncos\u2019 starting left guard tweaked his ankle in the fourth quarter against Chicago.\n\nKubiak said Mathis didn\u2019t do anything because his ankle was \u201creally sore\u201d and he has a good bit to go to be ready for Sunday.\n\nRookie guard Max Garcia would likely start at left guard if Mathis was unable to go against New England.\n\nThe Broncos also got a boost on the defensive line when Antonio Smith (hip) and Vance Walker (shoulder returned to practice.\n\nNeither practiced all last week and were listed questionable for the Broncos\u2019 17-15 win over Chicago. Smith ended up playing limited snaps, while Walker was inactive.\n\nThe newest Bronco quarterback, Christian Ponder, was at practice Wednesday wearing No. 2. He spent a lot of time watching Brock Osweiler and Trevor Siemian, but also did some throwing of his own.\n\nKubiak confirmed Siemian will remain the backup quarterback Sunday against the Patriots.\n\nSafety Darian Stewart was at practice Wednesday with a new member in his family. His wife, Whitley, gave birth to his daughter this morning.\n\nCameron Wolfe: 303-954-1891, cwolfe@denverpost.com or @CameronWolfe", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Updates on Emmanuel Sanders, DeMarcus Ware and Evan Mathis injuries", "title": "Updates on Emmanuel Sanders, DeMarcus Ware and Evan Mathis injuries", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/11/25/updates-on-emmanuel-sanders-demarcus-ware-and-evan-mathis-injuries/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151115_093656_emmanuel-sanders-2.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151115_093656_emmanuel-sanders-2.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-11-25T12:34:45+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-20T05:38:11+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Rookie guard Max Garcia would likely start at left guard if Mathis was unable to go against New England.\nDenver got a much-needed weapon back on the field Wednesday when Emmanuel Sanders returned to practice.\nGuard Evan Mathis (ankle) also did not practice Wednesday.\nThe Broncos\u2019 starting left guard tweaked his ankle in the fourth quarter against Chicago.\nOutside linebacker DeMarcus Ware (back) returned to the field, but did not practice."}
