Some TV personalities celebrated by cracking naughty jokes, others by popping open the bubbly on air, but all seemed to have a good time.

Some TV hosts might be ringing in the new year with hangovers.

"I got that bubbly. I got that bubbly. I got that!" CNN anchor Don Lemon said.

Some had Champagne. Some didn't. They all had fun.

"There's children here, Kathy!" Anderson Cooper told Kathy Griffin.

Over on ABC â€” tame by comparison.

"Are you guys ready for 2016? Sure are! ... I'll be starting the new year with a broken eardrum," ABC correspondent Jenny McCarthy said.

Ryan Seacrest kept it PG with cheek kisses.

It got a little more wild as the night went on.

"I'm here with my man Carson, taking over!" Terry Crews said.

"He's been spray-tanned!" Griffin said.

"The last time I was in Tipitina's ... I ended up going home with not a lot of clothes on," Lemon said.

"I'm looking forward to working a lot to pay for the lawsuits against NBC, who's going to sue me after tonight," comedian Whitney Cummings said.

"Happy New Year! Mwah!" said Lemon.
