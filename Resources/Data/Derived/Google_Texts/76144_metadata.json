I also want to thank those who spoke up on this issue \u2014 including that long ago White House petition,\u201d Home School Legal Defense Association Chairman Michael Farris said in a press release.\u201cWe believe that the public outcry made a huge impact. What an amazing turnaround \u2014 in just 24 hours.\u201dThe case stems from the family\u2019s belief that its children should be home schooled. Germany would not allow that practice, and Uwe and Hannelore Romeike \u2014 who have raised their children as devout Christians and began home schooling three of them in 2006 \u2014 feared they would lose custody of them after German authorities visited the family\u2019s home and began issuing fines. Attending state-approved schools is mandatory in Germany.The Romeikes knew another German family in Morristown, Tenn., so they moved there with their five children in 2008. Since then, the couple has had another child and is now expecting its seventh.The family was granted asylum in 2010, marking the first time home schooling was successfully used as a reason for earning asylum in this country, according to a World Magazine article.The family then lost its asylum status at every level of court it faced after the Obama administration balked at the decision. A White House petition was submitted; the White House declined to comment on the specifics of the case, saying only that \u201chomeschooling is a popular option for many parents pursuing high academic standards for their children.\u201dThe Home School Legal Defense Association (HSLDA) has been working with the family to keep it from getting deported.\u201cWhen we lost at the Sixth Circuit [in 2013], I told Uwe that he would go back to Germany over my dead body,\u201d Farris said in the HSLDA release. \u201cI\u2019m glad that wasn\u2019t necessary! This is a courageous family and one that deserves to stay here. They are modern day Pilgrims.\u201dMonday\u2019s Supreme Court ruling all but sealed the family\u2019s fate before Homeland Security stepped in.\u201cOur entire family is deeply grateful for all the support of our friends and fellow homeschoolers and especially HSLDA,\u201d Uwe Romeike said in the HSLDA release. \u201cI thank God for his hand of blessing and protection over our family. We thank the American government for allowing us to stay here and to peacefully homeschool our children \u2014 it\u2019s all we ever wanted.\u201dThe HSLDA says the Romeikes were granted \u201cindefinite deferred action status\u201d and can stay in the U.S. for the foreseeable future. Monday\u2019s Supreme Court ruling showed that the U.S. government does not consider home schooling a fundamental human right; the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s decision goes against that.Still, the family will not be U.S. citizens. The Romeikes will remain in the U.S. as, essentially, refugees.\u201cAs long as we can live at peace here, we are happy,\u201d Uwe Romeike told the HSLDA.\u201cWe have always been ready to go wherever the Lord would lead us \u2014 and I know my citizenship isn\u2019t really on Earth. This has always been about our children. I wouldn\u2019t have minded staying in Germany if the mistreatment targeted only me \u2014 but our whole family was targeted when German authorities would not tolerate our decision to teach our children \u2014 that is what brought us here.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "homeschool,germany,family,asylum", "pubdate": "2014-03-04T20:28:55", "og": {"site_name": "Newsmax", "description": "A homeschooling German family that was granted asylum in the United States six years ago and was on the verge of being deported after the U.S. Supreme Court rejected its final appeal to stay in the U.S. on Monday will be allowed to remain in the country after all.", "title": "Victory for Homeschool Family Facing Deportation", "url": "http://www.newsmax.com/US/homeschool-germany-family-asylum/2014/03/04/id/556072/", "type": "article", "image": "http://www.newsmax.com/CMSPages/GetFile.aspx?guid=45842dcd-faaf-499c-8ca2-ddfcc437f539&SiteName=Newsmax", "page_id": 85452072376}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.newsmax.com/US/homeschool-germany-family-asylum/2014/03/04/id/556072/", "title": "Victory for Homeschool Family Facing Deportation", "description": "A homeschooling German family that was granted asylum in the United States six years ago and was on the verge of being deported after the U.S. Supreme Court rejected its final appeal to stay in the U.S. on Monday will be allowed to remain in the country after all.", "site": "Newsmax"}, "fb": {"admins": 100002083767056, "app_id": 323020797885219}, "msvalidate.01": "FAF1322EC761685A5DD9344A1C19E82A", "epoch": 1393964935, "google-site-verification": "Jt2HUKgzJJw9VwIQJv31ETytuvNNm5ypTWN6j0nYvHM", "keywords": "homeschool,germany,family,asylum", "article": {"section": "US", "published_time": "2014-03-04T20:28:55"}, "original-source": "http://www.newsmax.com/US/homeschool-germany-family-asylum/2014/03/04/id/556072/", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "description": "A homeschooling German family that was granted asylum in the United States six years ago and was on the verge of being deported after the U.S. Supreme Court rejected its final appeal to stay in the U.S. on Monday will be allowed to remain in the country after all."}, "article_summary": "Attending state-approved schools is mandatory in Germany.The Romeikes knew another German family in Morristown, Tenn., so they moved there with their five children in 2008.\nWhat an amazing turnaround \u2014 in just 24 hours.\u201dThe case stems from the family\u2019s belief that its children should be home schooled.\nThis is a courageous family and one that deserves to stay here.\n\u201cI thank God for his hand of blessing and protection over our family.\nI wouldn\u2019t have minded staying in Germany if the mistreatment targeted only me \u2014 but our whole family was targeted when German authorities would not tolerate our decision to teach our children \u2014 that is what brought us here.\u201d"}
