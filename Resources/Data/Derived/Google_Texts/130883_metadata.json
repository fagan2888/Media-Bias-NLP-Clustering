He even called on several supporters who said things that caught his attention.\n\nIn a pre-appearance interview, Trump told reporters he intended to carry on with a similar strategy in South Carolina as he has done in other primary states by addressing issues that concern the GOP base: strengthening the Southern border, protecting the Second Amendment and replacing the Affordable Care Act with something better.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to take care of the middle class,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThe middle class is almost like the forgotten class. They take care of people at the low end and the high end, and they\u2019ve forgotten the people in the middle.\u201d\n\nThough speculation is growing on who South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley might endorse in the coming weeks, Trump said he didn\u2019t expect it to be him.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve given her a lot of campaign contributions, but she obviously won\u2019t be endorsing me and that\u2019s fine,\u201d Trump said. \u201cShe can endorse whoever she wants. I don\u2019t think it\u2019ll be me, but I wish her a lot of luck with the endorsement.\u201d\n\nHaley, who has acknowledged being critical of Trump and other \u201cangry voices\u201d in her State of the Union response, is expected to side with Florida Sen. Marco Rubio or even former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, if he does well in New Hampshire.\n\nBut Trump already has the endorsement of South Carolina\u2019s second-in-command, Lt. Gov. Henry McMaster. Long considered an establishment politician, McMaster was at the Florence event and gave the opening speech.\n\nS.C. Senate President Pro Tempore Hugh Leatherman, R-Florence, was among other state politicos at Friday\u2019s rally.\n\nTrump said he expected to do well among black voters in the state, even as the state\u2019s black electorate traditionally votes Democratic.\n\n\u201cI think I\u2019m going to do fantastically with African-Americans,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI have so many great friendships. And also, they know I\u2019m going to bring jobs back from China and all of these other places that have stolen our jobs.\u201d\n\nOnce Trump took to the stage, he touched on familiar points, such as criticizing the nuclear agreement with Iran. He also talked about Christianity and the \u201cbeautiful churches\u201d he spotted on the way to the Civic Center from the regional airport.\n\nHe also brought up the results of the Iowa Republican Caucus, saying he thought he should\u2019ve finished first.\n\n\u201cA lot of things happened there,\u201d he said, referring to the feud between the campaigns of Sen. Ted Cruz and retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson over suggestions that Carson was potentially dropping out, creating friction.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I came in second,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI think I came in first. But honestly, it doesn\u2019t matter. My total focus is now on New Hampshire. And then next week, my total focus is going to be here in South Carolina.\u201d\n\nReach Cynthia Roldan at 843-708-5891.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Donald Trump says he\u2019s \u2018fine\u2019 with S.C.
