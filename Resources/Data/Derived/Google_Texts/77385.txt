Army wife and mother, Holly Fisher, is under fire from the left for standing up for conservative businesses and the Constitution via images she tweeted of herself holding a Bible and an AR-15 with the U.S. flag in the background.

In another tweeted photo, she stood in front of Hobby Lobby after its recent Supreme Court victory over Obamacare. In the photo, she wore a “pro life” shirt and held a drink from Chick-fil-A.

During a July 10 Fox & Friends segment, host Anna Kooiman talked of how outraged the left have been over Fisher’s photos. They have compared her to a terrorist and threatened to stone her–actually invited her to submit to stoning in one instance.

Fisher responded:

It’s shocking for me that people would compare somebody that’s standing in front of our flag that represents our freedom–on Independence Day–and I’m holding my First and Second Amendment rights in my hands, and it all represents freedom. They want to compare me to a woman who thinks quite the opposite. She despises everything about this country and hates this country and would kill all of us if given the opportunity.

Host Brian Kilmeade asked her why she posted the photo, and Fisher said she did so because after she posted the Hobby Lobby photo, people said, “The only thing missing is your gun or your Bible or your flag.” So for the Independence Day picture, she posed with her AR-15 and Bible in front of the U.S. flag.

She said she expected less backlash from that pose because it represented our country’s founding principles. She was wrong, but that won’t stop her.

She stated that there is a “growing intolerance among the left” that leaves “conservatives afraid to speak up.” Nonetheless, she is going to speak up.
