A 66-year-old man was killed Saturday in a car crash on the northwest side, Milwaukee police said.

The accident happened about 9:40 a.m.

The victim was a passenger in an auto that was southbound on N. 76th St. at W. Good Hope Road when that vehicle failed to stop for a red light and was struck by a vehicle westbound on Good Hope.

Police said neither drugs nor alcohol appeared to be a factor in the crash, which remains under investigation.
