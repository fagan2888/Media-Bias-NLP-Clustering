Student loan debt is at a record high of $1.1 trillion, and the average undergraduate who borrows to attend school graduates nearly $30,000 in debt. Almost 20 percent of student borrowers are in default.\n\nYet a couple of little-noticed legislative tweaks to a small, obscure loan repayment program \u2014 revisions made under two very different presidents \u2014 appear to have created the conditions for far-reaching changes in how a college education is bought and paid for. The result may make it much easier for students to get out from under their debts.\n\nThe first changes happened in September 2007, when Congress passed a major overhaul of the federal college financial aid system. Most of the news coverage at the time focused on the fact that government subsidies would shift from private banks that offered loans to Pell Grants for low-income students. But the bill that President George W. Bush later signed contained another modest change in the law that would later gather significance.\n\nTo understand how that change set in motion what is happening today, it first helps to understand how the original government loan program worked. Starting in the 1960s, the federal government offered generous subsidies to private banks, which would then make loans to students.\n\nIn the 1990s, President Clinton helped create a new loan option that allowed students to borrow directly from the United States Department of Education. If they did, they were eligible for an income-based repayment regime in which loan payments were limited to 20 percent of the borrower\u2019s income, after a deduction for basic living expenses. Any balance remaining after 25 years of payments was forgiven.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut the repayment option wasn\u2019t available to students who borrowed under the private sector loan program. Those lenders, flush with federal subsidies, dominated the market at the time. Few people enrolled in the income-based program.\n\nThe 2007 law modified that idea and called it IBR (for Income-Based Repayment). Under the new program, the repayment terms were made more generous. Monthly payments were capped at 15 percent of income, rather than 20 percent, and the living expense deduction was raised significantly. The loan forgiveness threshold stayed at 25 years, with an important exception: Loan balances would be wiped clean after only 10 years for people who worked in public service jobs, broadly defined as anywhere in the government or nonprofit sectors.\n\nThe logic behind income-based repayment is that because students can\u2019t control whether they graduate in a recession, the student loan system is particularly vulnerable to the business cycle.\n\n\u201cCollege degrees pay off in the long run, but many graduates struggle to manage their debt upon graduation,\u201d said Rory O\u2019Sullivan, deputy director of Young Invincibles, a millennial research and advocacy group. \u201cIncome-based repayment plans protect students from early career struggles, layoffs and tough economic times.\u201d\n\nPaying as They Earn Increasingly, student loan borrowers are enrolling in income-driven repayment plans, under which they can pay a percentage of their income, usually 10 to 15 percent, rather than a fixed monthly payment.

If you make nothing, you owe nothing, and your loan doesn\u2019t go into default. The loan forgiveness provision protects borrowers from too much interest accumulating over time.\n\nIn 2010, Barack Obama was president, and he, too, pushed a financial aid overhaul through Congress. This time, the government-subsidized private sector loan program was entirely shut down.\n\nImportant changes to the income-based repayments were made, but because they were passed under the same legislation that created the Affordable Care Act, few people paid much attention to them. IBR had been made even more generous. Now borrowers had to pay only 10 percent of their income per month, even as the forgiveness threshold was lowered to 20 years. People who work in government or nonprofits are still eligible for forgiveness after a decade. Although it was originally slated to become effective in 2014, Obama administration lawyers found a way to effectively speed up the IBR start date by several years. Most important, all students would now borrow directly from the federal government and be eligible for the more favorable repayment terms.\n\nAt first, uptake was slow. Students have to apply for IBR, and it took time for the Education Department to spread the word.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut the latest numbers show a powerful shift. By the third quarter of the 2013 federal fiscal year, only 6 percent of federal borrowers, representing 14.4 percent of the Education Department\u2019s outstanding loan portfolio, were enrolled. Since then, awareness has grown and the numbers have surged. By the end of 2014, the number of borrowers in IBR had nearly doubled, to 11.8 percent. Those borrowers had larger loans on average and represented almost 25 percent of all federal direct student loan dollars owed \u2014 over $100 billion. As loans made before IBR was put into effect continue to come off the books, the new system is sure to grow.\n\nWe appear to be in the middle of a rapid transition in how student loans are repaid, one that is moving the federal government into the same role that state governments played for much of the 20th century: the foundational provider of broad, unqualified subsidies for higher learning.\n\nThe historical social contract used to be straightforward. All citizens were eligible for generous government college subsidies in the form of low tuition at public colleges and universities. Graduates \u201cpaid back\u201d that subsidy in the form of larger tax payments \u2014 and in most states, higher marginal tax rates \u2014 on the additional income that their diplomas helped them earn.\n\nSome graduates earned more and paid more; some earned less and paid less. Nobody said that a college graduate who ultimately paid back less in taxes than the amount of his or her original tuition subsidy had \u201cdefaulted,\u201d because it was understood that luck, business cycles and career choices vary, and that the collective result for all students was good for society.\n\nBy moving more students into IBR, the federal government is essentially replicating this arrangement. Once again, those who earn more pay more, returning the full amount of their loan, plus interest, before the 20-year forgiveness threshold is met. Those who earn less, for whatever reason, pay less. Nobody will ever default simply because they can\u2019t afford to pay.\n\nPhoto\n\nFor many, the interest rate on their loan won\u2019t matter. Take, for example, someone who finishes a bachelor\u2019s degree with the national average of $29,000 in debt, and borrows another $13,000 for a master\u2019s degree in education. The new graduate goes to work as a schoolteacher at a starting salary of $35,000, which grows to $50,000 after 10 years. Under IBR, the monthly loan payment will start at $117 and never rise above $200. The teacher will pay only $18,360 in total on the loans, and $48,840 in principal and accumulated interest will be forgiven after 10 years.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20150124125533, "twitter": {"description": "Some little-noticed legislative changes have created conditions for a far-reaching overhaul of how a college education is bought and paid for.", "title": "A Quiet Revolution in Helping Lift the Burden of Student Debt", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/25/upshot/a-quiet-revolution-in-helping-lift-the-burden-of-student-debt.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003466653"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/01/25/business/25-UP-LOANS-1422038099254/25-UP-LOANS-1422038099254-thumbLarge.jpg", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/25/upshot/a-quiet-revolution-in-helping-lift-the-burden-of-student-debt.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003466653", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/25/upshot/a-quiet-revolution-in-helping-lift-the-burden-of-student-debt.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "thumbnail_width": 75, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "upshot", "channels": "NytNow", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/upshot/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "Jan. 24, 2015", "edt": "NewYork", "article": {"section_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/upshot", "section": "The Upshot", "modified": "2015-01-27", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/upshot/index.jsonp", "tag": "Financial Aid (Education)", "published": "2015-01-24", "section-taxonomy-id": "D64FAE4C-4425-4E5A-B898-6C8CB59F9957"}, "keywords": "Colleges and Universities,Student Loans,Law and Legislation,Education Department (US),Bush  George W,Clinton  Bill,Obama  Barack,Financial Aid (Education)", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "Kevin Carey", "thumbnail_150": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/01/25/business/25-UP-LOANS-1422038099254/25-UP-LOANS-1422038099254-thumbLarge.jpg", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "per": "Obama, Barack", "slug": "25up-loans", "byl": "By KEVIN CAREY", "thumbnail_150_height": 150, "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "Some little-noticed legislative changes have created conditions for a far-reaching overhaul of how a college education is bought and paid for.", "tom": "News", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/01/25/business/25-UP-LOANS-1422038099254/25-UP-LOANS-1422038099254-thumbStandard.jpg", "description": "Some little-noticed legislative changes have created conditions for a far-reaching overhaul of how a college education is bought and paid for.", "CG": "upshot", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "Jan. 24, 2015", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "News", "org": "Education Department (US)", "thumbnail_height": 75, "thumbnail_150_width": 150, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20150127145018, "hdl_p": "Helping to Lift the Burden of Student Debt", "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/25/upshot/a-quiet-revolution-in-helping-lift-the-burden-of-student-debt.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/01/25/business/25-UP-LOANS-1422038099254/25-UP-LOANS-1422038099254-facebookJumbo.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Some little-noticed legislative changes have created conditions for a far-reaching overhaul of how a college education is bought and paid for.", "title": "A Quiet Revolution in Helping Lift the Burden of Student Debt"}, "pdate": 20150124, "des": "Financial Aid (Education)", "articleid": 100000003466653, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "A Quiet Revolution in Helping Lift the Burden of Student Debt", "col": "Cost of College", "PST": "News"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca20e\"", "article_summary": "Student loan debt is at a record high of $1.1 trillion, and the average undergraduate who borrows to attend school graduates nearly $30,000 in debt.\nAlmost 20 percent of student borrowers are in default.\nPhotoHas the student loan crisis already been solved?\nThose borrowers had larger loans on average and represented almost 25 percent of all federal direct student loan dollars owed \u2014 over $100 billion.\nThe 2007 law modified that idea and called it IBR (for Income-Based Repayment)."}
