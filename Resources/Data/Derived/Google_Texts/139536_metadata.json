Ken Ivory to Idaho in December to address lawmakers about the state taking control of federal lands, prompting two resolutions on that topic to pass and the convening of a legislative interim committee.\n\n- Promoting in 2009, and getting passed in 2010, the \u201cIdaho Health Freedom Act,\u201d requiring the state to sue the federal government over the Affordable Care Act.\n\n- Promoting legislation that passed the House, but failed in the Senate, to provide $10 million in tax credits for scholarships to entice students to move from public to private schools. \u201cIFF\u2019s role in getting the legislation through the House was huge,\u201d the group wrote in its 2013 Idaho Legislative Review.\n\n- Writing legislation allowing the governor to sign an executive order authorizing the killing of wolves that threaten property or people; it passed and became law.\n\n- Persuading the Idaho Legislature this year to enact new rules requiring video of legislative sessions to be preserved and archived, rather than deleted after five days.\n\n- Getting legislation killed for two straight years that sought to limit minors\u2019 use of artificial tanning beds, based on skin cancer risk; the bill was sought by Idaho dermatologists.\n\n- Getting legislation passed in 2011 to require a public vote to form a new urban renewal agency, and then conducting an educational campaign against an urban renewal ballot measure in May in Shoshone County, after which the measure was defeated.\n\nFounder and President Wayne Hoffman says the Idaho Freedom Foundation was formed as a \u201cfree market think tank,\u201d but the keynote speaker at IFF\u2019s annual fundraising banquet this year, conservative commentator Michelle Malkin, said, \u201cThat\u2019s really a misnomer, because you\u2019re a \u2018do\u2019 tank.\u201d IFF is loosely affiliated with similar groups in other states through the State Policy Network.\n\nBOISE \u2013 In the ornate public gallery of the Idaho House of Representatives, lobbyist Erik Makrush of the Idaho Freedom Foundation leaned over to a reporter sitting next to him and whispered, \u201cIf you have any questions, you can ask me.\u201d\n\nThe House was debating one of 11 bills that would trim the powers of urban renewal agencies in the state, a hot political issue in Idaho\u2019s 2011 legislative session. Makrush said he\u2019d written all of them.\n\nA year later, Idaho Freedom Foundation President Wayne Hoffman persuaded a House committee chairwoman to pull a bill he opposed just as debate was about to start on the floor.\n\nBoth episodes illustrate the raw political power of a nonprofit charity that some believe is abusing its lucrative tax-free status. Although charitable organizations are allowed to do some lobbying without risking their tax benefits, the Idaho Freedom Foundation actively pushes and opposes legislation on dozens of issues every session in ways that more closely resemble a full-on lobbying group.\n\n\u201cIf Wayne Hoffman can call a committee chairman and have a bill pulled, that\u2019s pretty remarkable clout,\u201d said House Minority Leader John Rusche, D-Lewiston.\n\nAt issue is whether taxpayers should be subsidizing its activities.\n\nAs a charity organized under Internal Revenue Code section 501(c)(3), contributions to the Idaho Freedom Foundation are tax deductible. Contributions to lobbying groups organized under section 501(c)(4), such as the Sierra Club or the National Rifle Association, are not.\n\nIn its scant five years in existence, the IFF has become one of the most active and influential groups in Idaho\u2019s Statehouse.\n\n\u201cWe have good relationships,\u201d Hoffman said of his group\u2019s activities. \u201cSo they (lawmakers) take our calls, they listen to us, they read our emails.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re pretty darn active,\u201d said Sen. Cherie Buckner-Webb, D-Boise. \u201cThey\u2019re visible in every committee room I serve on.\u201d\n\nHoffman maintains it\u2019s really not a lobbying group and that it does only a small amount of lobbying. He reported spending just $13,000 on lobbying in 2012, out of $447,108 in total expenses. In 2011, he reported just $10,290 spent on lobbying; in 2010 and 2009, he reported that the group spent zero to influence legislation.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re an education organization,\u201d said Hoffman, who was paid $99,645 by the group in 2012. \u201cOur biggest focus is the education of policymakers.\u201d\n\nHowever, experts say IFF likely is underreporting its lobbying under federal tax laws, which potentially could endanger its tax-free status. \u201cI think there\u2019s a serious yellow flag here,\u201d said Lloyd Hitoshi Mayer, a nationally known expert on nonprofit tax law and a law professor at the University of Notre Dame.\n\nThis year, IFF had three registered lobbyists, was a constant presence in the Capitol and led the opposition to the governor\u2019s biggest legislative proposal of the session, the bill creating a state-based health insurance exchange. It rated 150 bills against its agenda, assigning positive or negative scores, and tracked lawmakers\u2019 votes. The group writes legislation, testifies to committees, sponsors lectures and tours for legislators, conducts polls, publishes reports and sends out emails, and its lawmaker scores have been prominently featured in campaign ads.\n\nIFF also operates an online news site, Idahoreporter.com, and a government transparency website that posts salaries of public employees at the local and state level, but most of its work focuses on influencing public policy. It doesn\u2019t disclose its donors.\n\nAsked what the organization has accomplished, Hoffman touts a long list of victories over the past five years in passing and defeating legislation on everything from wolves to tanning beds.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re trying to influence the outcome of legislation,\u201d Rusche said. \u201cIsn\u2019t that what you would consider lobbying? I do.\u201d\n\nMayer said, \u201cI think there\u2019s a question regarding whether it\u2019s appropriately operating as a (c)(3), whether it\u2019s engaging in too much lobbying.\u201d\n\nDirect lobbying, Mayer said, is defined as \u201cany attempt to influence any legislation through communication with any member or employee of the legislative body, if the communication refers to specific legislation, and reflects a view on such legislation.\u201d\n\nThere are exceptions, he noted, and they\u2019re complicated. But, he said, \u201cMost organizations that do this kind of stuff form themselves as (c)(4)s, so they avoid these issues.\u201d\n\nBut 501(c)(4) organizations lack lucrative tax benefits for contributors.\n\nRep. Luke Malek, R-Coeur d\u2019Alene, who worked with the Freedom Foundation on a bill this year, said, \u201cI do appreciate that they are passionate about what they do. They do work their issues hard.\u201d He added, \u201cI would have assumed their budget was more for lobbying, just because they do have several lobbyists.\u201d\n\nMany lawmakers compare IFF\u2019s lobbying activity to that of the Idaho Association of Commerce and Industry, a long-standing business group that touts itself as \u201cThe Voice of Business in Idaho\u201d and long has been an influential and highly visible lobbying force.\n\nIACI President Alex LaBeau said his group is no charity. It\u2019s a 501(c)(6) organization, a designation for business groups and chambers of commerce that allows unlimited lobbying. \u201cThe donations to a 501(c)(6) are not tax deductible because we are directly involved in lobbying, not just information,\u201d LaBeau said. \u201cWe make no bones about the fact that we\u2019re a full-on lobbying organization.\u201d\n\nOther charitable organizations in Idaho also do some lobbying, such as Catholic Charities of Idaho and the Idaho Conservation League. But it\u2019s only a small part of what Catholic Charities does; the group operates charity services across the state, including counseling, parenting classes, after-school programs, social ministry work and citizenship classes.\n\nThe Idaho Conservation League reported spending $56,275 on lobbying in 2012, out of its total expenditures of $1.55 million. That\u2019s nearly five times as much as IFF reported, but the conservation group, despite having four registered lobbyists that year, was much less active in the Statehouse, limiting its attention to specific environmental issues.\n\n\u201cMost of what we do on any given day is not related to lobbying,\u201d said Rick Johnson, the ICL\u2019s executive director. A separate group, Conservation Voters of Idaho, formed by some of ICL\u2019s founders, has a (c)(4) arm that can lobby and a political action committee that participates in campaigns.\n\nSome lawmakers were surprised to learn that IFF operates as a tax-exempt charity, rather than a political group. \u201cI\u2019m taken aback,\u201d said Buckner-Webb, the Boise Democratic senator. \u201cI don\u2019t view them at all as nonpartisan, and I think I\u2019m pretty broad-minded. \u2026 I see their focus being on conservative legislators \u2026 holding conservative legislators accountable.\u201d\n\nFederal tax laws generally allow up to 20 percent of a 501(c)(3) charity\u2019s expenditures to go for lobbying. That includes lobbying the public on ballot measures, because in that case the public is the legislative body making the decision.\n\n\u201cLobbying is a very specific thing,\u201d Hoffman said, adding that he believes as long as any of his group\u2019s communications stop short of saying \u201cvote yes\u201d or \u201cvote no,\u201d they haven\u2019t crossed the \u201cbright line\u201d between education and lobbying.\n\nHowever, Mayer said, \u201cMr. Hoffman is confusing federal election law with federal tax law. More specifically, he is confusing the rules relating to whether a communication is \u2018express advocacy\u2019 for purposes of the federal election law with the rules relating to whether a communication is lobbying for the purposes of the federal tax laws. The federal tax laws defining lobbying are much broader \u2026 and reach essentially any communication that mentions specific legislation and reflects a view on that legislation, whether expressly or less directly.\u201d\n\nHoffman said in his view, even writing bills isn\u2019t lobbying. \u201cAs I understand it, that is not lobbying because what you are doing is you are working on helping lawmakers divine good public policy, which is what we do anyway,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s educational.\u201d\n\nHe has the same view of the town meetings, literature and pre-election robocalls his group sponsored when Shoshone County had a measure on the ballot in May to form a new urban renewal agency, though he boasts that after IFF\u2019s efforts, the measure failed by a 3-1 margin. \u201cThat was just an education effort,\u201d he said.\n\nMayer said the robocalls likely qualify as direct lobbying because they asserted that the measure would drive up taxes and take away people\u2019s ability to vote on future projects. \u201cThe lack of \u2018vote against\u2019 or similar language does not control,\u201d he said.\n\nHe noted, \u201cA communication can be both educational and lobbying; the terms are not mutually exclusive.\u201d A lobbying communication might also be \u201cinformative,\u201d he said.\n\nIFF was formed in November 2009; at its first legislative session in 2010, its employees testifying to legislative committees insisted they were not lobbying, just providing information. Numerous legislative committee chairmen didn\u2019t buy it and questioned them closely about the positions they were taking on bills they addressed.\n\n\u201cIt was frustrating,\u201d Hoffman said. \u201cWe only intended to educate.\u201d\n\nAt the end of that session, IFF filed for the 501(h) election, notifying the IRS it would be lobbying but staying under the 20 percent expenditure limit.\n\n\u201cDo we lobby? Yes, and I am very, very glad that at least somebody over there is speaking out on behalf of taxpayers and the average, ordinary citizen who is looking for somebody to defend their pursuit of economic opportunity,\u201d Hoffman said. \u201cI would never apologize for that. \u2026 We take a close look at it and determine whether our activities constitute lobbying. The bright line is always \u2018vote yes,\u2019 \u2018vote no.\u2019 \u201d\n\nHoffman said about the only thing he reports on his Form 990 as lobbying is his own time spent telling legislators to vote one way or another, or sending emails or writing letters with that message. \u201cIt\u2019s time that I spend testifying in committee,\u201d he said, and reflects \u201cvery little\u201d of his other employees\u2019 time. IFF has eight full-time employees plus a handful of interns and independent contractors.\n\nHoffman said his vision for the group is \u201cto be the most influential organization in the state \u2013 we want lawmakers and other policymakers to call us up and ask what constitutes good public policies, and then act accordingly.\n\n\u201cMost of what we do is educational. That\u2019s what a 501(c)(3) is supposed to be about,\u201d he said. \u201cWe educate legislators. Who else would do that if we weren\u2019t there?\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "BOISE \u2013 In the ornate public gallery of the Idaho House of Representatives, lobbyist Erik Makrush of the Idaho Freedom Foundation leaned over to a reporter sitting next to him and whispered, \u201cIf you have any questions, you can ask me.\u201d  The House was debating one of 11 bills that would trim the powers of urban renewal agencies in the state, a hot political issue in Idaho\u2019s 2011 legislative session.
