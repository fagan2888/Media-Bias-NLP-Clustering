Over and over again, it\u2019s reported that we can only distinguish between about 10,000 different scents\u2014a large number, but one that\u2019s easily dwarfed by that of dogs, estimated to have a sense of smell that\u2019s 1,000 to 10,000 times more sensitive than ours.\n\nIt may be indisputable that dogs do have a superior sense of smell, but new research suggests that our own isn\u2019t too shabby either. And it turns out that the \u201c10,000 different scents\u201d figure, concocted in the 1920s, was a theoretical estimate, not based on any hard data.\n\nWhen a group of researchers from the Rockefeller University sought to rigorously figure out for the first time how many scents we can distinguish, they showed the 1920s figure to be a dramatic underestimate. In a study published today in Science, they show that\u2014at least among the 26 participants in their study\u2014the human nose is actually capable of distinguishing between something on the order of a trillion different scents.\n\n\u201cThe message here is that we have more sensitivity in our sense of smell than for which we give ourselves credit,\u201d Andreas Keller, an olfactory researcher at Rockefeller and lead author of the study, said in a press statement. \u201cWe just don\u2019t pay attention to it and don\u2019t use it in everyday life.\u201d\n\nA big part of the reason it took so long to accurately gauge our scent sensitivity is that it\u2019s much more difficult to do so than, say, test the range of wavelengths of light the human eye can perceive, or the range of soundwaves the human ear can hear. But the researchers had a hunch that the real number was far greater than 10,000, because it was previously documented that humans have upwards of 400 different smell receptors which work in concert. For comparison, the three light receptors in the human eye allow us to see an estimated 10 million colors.\n\nNoting that the vast majority of real-world scents are the result of many molecules mixed together\u2014the smell of a rose, for instance, is the result of 275 unique molecules in combination\u2014the researchers developed a method to test their hunch. They worked with a diverse set of 128 different molecules that act as odorants, mixing them in unique combinations. Although many familiar scents\u2014such as orange, anise and spearmint\u2014are the results of molecules used in the study, the odorants were deliberately mixed to produce unfamiliar smells (combinations that were often, the researchers note, rather \u201cnasty and weird\u201d).", "article_metadata": {"description": "New research suggests our olfactory system is far more sensitive than we previously thought", "title": "The human nose can distinguish between 1 trillion different scents", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "New research suggests our olfactory system is far more sensitive than we previously thought", "title": "The human nose can distinguish between 1 trillion different scents", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/03/23/the_human_nose_can_distinguish_between_one_trillion_different_scents_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/03/shutterstock_182713808.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "New research suggests our olfactory system is far more sensitive than we previously thought", "title": "The human nose can distinguish between 1 trillion different scents", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/03/shutterstock_182713808.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Joseph Stromberg", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, dogs, Human Nose, Nose, Rockefeller University, Sense of Smell, Smithsonian.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "And it turns out that the \u201c10,000 different scents\u201d figure, concocted in the 1920s, was a theoretical estimate, not based on any hard data.\nThey worked with a diverse set of 128 different molecules that act as odorants, mixing them in unique combinations.\nIn a study published today in Science, they show that\u2014at least among the 26 participants in their study\u2014the human nose is actually capable of distinguishing between something on the order of a trillion different scents.\nTopics: dogs, Human Nose, Nose, Rockefeller University, Sense of Smell, Smithsonian.com, Life NewsThis article originally appeared on Smithsonian.comYou may have heard this one before: Humans, especially compared to animals such as dogs, have a remarkably weak sense of smell.\nFor comparison, the three light receptors in the human eye allow us to see an estimated 10 million colors."}
