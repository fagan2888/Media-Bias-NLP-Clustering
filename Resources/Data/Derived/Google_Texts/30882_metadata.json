Joe Lhota barely got a rise out of Democrats for months, but now he stands condemned by the enforcers of the liberal uber-class. The charge against him \u2014 firing-squad drum roll, please \u2014 is that he\u2019s \u201cdivisive.\u201d\n\nLhota\u2019s offense was to remind New Yorkers that Dollar Bill de Blasio\u2019s political mentor, other than Fidel Castro, was David Dinkins. That would be the same David Dinkins who presided over disastrous decline until voters had the sense to fire him.\n\nThose voters had courage, too, because critics of Dinkins were labeled \u201cdivisive.\u201d The race card also was played routinely, and is resurrected in a new Dinkins memoir.\n\nSuch is the fate of any who dare throw off the smothering blanket of leftist conformity. The thought police, having learned well the wrong lessons from George Orwell, insist that the only truth is the one they approve. The only standards they endorse are double standards.\n\nAnd so dissent was patriotic when George Bush was president, but treasonous under Barack Obama.\n\nThose same demagogues denounce Lhota for his ad showing the social collapse that coincided with the Dinkins mayoralty. Crime surged \u2014 an average of 2,000 murders a year \u2014 and walking the streets was risky. Anti-Semitism was in the air.\n\nThe symbol of Dinkins\u2019 New York was the squeegee man, whose business model was intimidation. Trapped motorists paid for dirty water on their windshields, or else. It was a stickup, $1 at a time.\n\nWhich is precisely why the man who defeated Dinkins, Rudy Giuliani, made getting rid of squeegee men a focus of his quality-of-life tenure. He didn\u2019t only aim to cut serious crime. He wanted people to feel safer, too.\n\nHow fitting then that, 20 years later, the mayoral race features a loyalist from each camp. For that reason alone, Lhota is right to sound the alarm about a Mayor de Blasio, who is actually far more radical than Dinkins ever was.\n\nThe attacks from the Dem goon squad are predictable, but more troubling is the silence of many people who know better. Terrified of de Blasio in City Hall, they are terrified to say so. They act as if they live in a police state, which is what they\u2019ll deserve if they forfeit their right to pick a side.\n\nPut it this way: If Lhota\u2019s truth-telling is \u201cdivisive,\u201d let\u2019s have more of it. Lots more.\n\nLet\u2019s also talk about welfare. When Giuliani took office in 1994, there were 1.1 million people on the dole, including many full-time college students, and Dinkins\u2019 team assumed the total would hit 1.5 million. They saw welfare as compassion and didn\u2019t have a clue about its corrosive effects on families and the work ethic.\n\nGiuliani knew better, and pushed for workfare and anti-fraud reforms that became part of the historic legislation President Bill Clinton signed. Mayor Bloomberg continues the approach, and now there are fewer than 400,000 city people getting welfare grants.\n\nThose changes prompt good questions for de Blasio: Does he think the city would be better off if there were 1.5 million people on welfare? Does he think the city would be better off with 2,000 murders instead of the 419 of last year?\n\nBut getting Dollar Bill to answer tough questions isn\u2019t easy. He\u2019s playing it safe, and his campaign consists of name-dropping endorsements and using his family in ads.\n\nMeanwhile, his \u201cvision\u201d turns out to be a pipe dream. His harping on the abuses of stop-and-frisk is not a strategy for stemming the murder tide in minority neighborhoods. Does he have a plan?\n\nHis talk of universal pre-kindergarten depends on an income-tax hike that Gov. Cuomo says won\u2019t happen. As for an education policy beyond squashing charters, he\u2019s waiting for dictation from the teachers union. Even advocates know his pledge of \u201caffordable housing\u201d is a slogan, not a policy.\n\nAnd don\u2019t forget taxes. When Lhota warned in the first debate that property taxes would go up, Dollar Bill said the only tax hike he\u2019s mentioned was on top incomes. That\u2019s a tacit admission there are others he hasn\u2019t talked about.\n\nGotham has experienced many ups and downs in the last two decades, but the unmistakable trend is one of progress. Despite its flaws, today\u2019s city is an urban miracle that features vastly improved public safety and attracts private investment from around the globe.\n\nOnly a fool would turn back the clock.\n\nDouble talk by Obama\n\nDr. Jekyll, meet Mr. Hyde.\n\nPresident Obama\u2019s pious lecture to Congress after the shutdown ended was full of bizarre passages, especially his demand for civility.\n\n\u201cWhen we disagree, we don\u2019t have to suggest that the other side doesn\u2019t love this country or believe in free enterprise or all the other rhetoric that seems to get worse every single year,\u201d he declared.\n\nRumor has it he was serious, but that\u2019s hard to believe if you remember way back to, oh, nine days earlier. Then, Obama demonized Republicans in the harshest language possible.\n\nAs I noted then, he accused the GOP seven times of demanding a \u201cransom,\u201d and of \u201cextortion,\u201d of threatening to \u201cblow the whole thing up\u201d and \u201cburn down your house.\u201d He called them \u201cideological extremists,\u201d knocked the \u201cTea Party\u2019s extremist agenda\u201d and said they were prepared to \u201ccause a recession.\u201d\n\nHe also demanded they compromise \u2014 while refusing to negotiate.\n\nHis my-way-or-the-highway approach is so routine that it rarely draws attention anymore. Yet that doesn\u2019t mean there are no consequences.\n\nThe history of ObamaCare makes the point. The signature \u201cachievement\u201d of his first two years came when Democrats controlled Congress and marked the first time major social legislation became law with one-party support.\n\nThe blowback came in 2010, when Republicans picked up 63 seats in the House \u2014 largely because of public opposition to ObamaCare. Fast forward to 2013, when the shutdown began as a kamikaze mission to defund it.\n\nThe law has never enjoyed majority public support, and its regulations are blamed for layoffs and the explosion of part-time jobs. The rollout of the state exchanges is a debacle that goes well beyond computer glitches. Even union allies concede it is destructive.\n\nSomeday, books will be written and classes taught showing ObamaCare as a cautionary tale on the hubris of one-party rule. But for now, we endure lectures about civility and compromise from its namesake, a man who practices neither.\n\nProve it, Snowden\n\nFugitive Edward Snowden insists he gave no secret surveillance files to Russia and China. If true, he should be eager to come home and prove it to a jury.\n\nBratton takes his shot\n\nBill Bratton apparently sees blasting Ray Kelly and the NYPD as part of his audition for getting the top job again. Should he succeed, I\u2019m sure he won\u2019t complain when the favor is returned.\n\nOur shiftless gov\u2019t\n\nA New York Times headline after the shutdown: \u201cLong Idle, Government Gets Back in Gear.\u201d\n\nBut wait, \u201cidle\u201d is the government gear.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "New York Post", "twitter": {"description": "He\u2019s finally done it.
