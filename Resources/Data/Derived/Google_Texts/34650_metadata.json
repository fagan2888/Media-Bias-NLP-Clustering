He had been one of the architects of Golden State\u2019s high-octane offense while an assistant with the world champions last season.\n\nNew Orleans interviewed him twice and announced his hire May 31.\n\nHe was an assistant at the University of Colorado from 1981-86 and reportedly had interest in the Nuggets job.\n\nDenver hired Michael Malone on June 15.\n\n\u201cThey got themselves a really, really good coach, a guy that works his butt off,\u201d Gentry said. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s anybody out there that works any harder (than Malone) or understands the game. He\u2019s been around it his whole life. So, I think they did great.\u201d\n\nMudiay update. Malone said rookie point guard Emmanuel Mudiay\u2019s sprained right ankle injury will be handled with care and not to expect him back soon.\n\n\u201cWe trust our athletic training staff to tell us when he can get back on the floor to start practicing,\u201d Malone said. \u201cAnd then obviously he\u2019ll have to get through a practice before he can play in a game. To be honest, I think he\u2019s probably a little ways away from that. So we\u2019ll be cautious. It\u2019s an injury he sustained while in China, and it\u2019s kind of come back a little bit.\u201d\n\nMudiay has missed four consecutive games with the injury.\n\n\u201cWe want to make sure it\u2019s not something where he plays a game then misses two games,\u201d Malone said. \u201cWe want to get him as close to 100 percent as possible and then put him back out there and get him into his rhythm.\u201d\n\nChristopher Dempsey: cdempsey@denverpost.com or @dempseypost", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Alvin Gentry calls Nuggets\u2019 hiring of Michael Malone \u201cgreat\u201d", "title": "Alvin Gentry calls Nuggets\u2019 hiring of Michael Malone \u201cgreat\u201d", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/12/20/alvin-gentry-calls-nuggets-hiring-of-michael-malone-great/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151220__Alvin-Gentryp1.jpg", "height": 444}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151220__Alvin-Gentryp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-12-20T19:46:38+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-20T00:10:36+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "\u201cThey got themselves a really, really good coach, a guy that works his butt off,\u201d Gentry said.\nTo be honest, I think he\u2019s probably a little ways away from that.\n\u201cWe want to make sure it\u2019s not something where he plays a game then misses two games,\u201d Malone said.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s anybody out there that works any harder (than Malone) or understands the game.\nHe was an assistant at the University of Colorado from 1981-86 and reportedly had interest in the Nuggets job."}
