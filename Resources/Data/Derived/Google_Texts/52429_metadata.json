I am confident this innovative initiative will strengthen our digital defense and ultimately enhance our national security,\u201d Defense Secretary Ash Carter said in a statement.\n\nThe particulars of who will be able to compete are still being worked out, though participants will have to be U.S. citizens, according to the defense officials.\n\nRelated: The Next Arms Race for the US, China and Russia: Hypersonic Weapons\n\nThe department\u2019s latest outreach goes beyond a scheme that could serve as the plot to a Hollywood action flick. It also announced that Alphabet Executive Chair Eric Schmidt will head up a new panel \u2013 the Defense Innovation Advisory Board -- to bring Silicon Valley's best corporate practices to the Pentagon.\n\nSchmidt will hand pick 12 panel members from the public- and private-sectors who have proven themselves tech-savvy and good at identifying new trends and potential breakthroughs with the hope that some of those brainstorms could be applied at the Pentagon.\n\nCarter is on a good will tour of the West Coast with stops in California and Washington State intended to augment the steps he took last year when he established the Defense Innovation Unit-Experimental, a Pentagon hub in Mountain View, California, a high-tech mecca.\n\nWhile the agency\u2019s Washington Beltway image may not compare favorably with the sunny environs of the West Coast, Carter is hoping its enormous bottom line might.\n\nRelated: Half a Trillion for the Pentagon? Why Defense Spending Is Only Going Higher\n\nSpeaking at an annual conference in San Francisco hosted by the security company RSA, he noted that the department wants to spend $72 billion next year on research and development programs across the board \u2013 including projects in robotics, hypersonic weapons and undersea drone platforms.\n\nThe department wants to spend about $35 billion over the next five years on cybersecurity alone, according to previously undisclosed budget documents obtained by Bloomberg. That figure includes roughly $14 billion for offensive operations against the country\u2019s adversaries and military activities in space.\n\nCarter, a physicist, also told the RSA audience that he favored strong encryption and isn\u2019t a \u201cbeliever in back doors.\u201d He was referring to a legal battle between Apple and the FBI. Law enforcement officials want the tech giant to create a key to unlock the phone used by one of the gunman responsible for the shooting in San Bernardino, California last year. The FBI maintains it is not asking for permanent back doors to encrypted information.\n\nCarter\u2019s comments drew applause, but that\u2019s a long way from winning hearts and minds.\n\n\u201cWe are you. You pay us. We represent you and our job is to protect you, and we\u2019d love to have your help,\u201d he implored at the end of his remarks.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The U.S. Defense Department is stepping up its efforts to woo Silicon Valley, hoping to attract the best and brightest into government service and hopefully boost its ability to field cutting-edge technology to the troops.", "title": "The Pentagon Scrambles to Win Hearts and Minds in Silicon Valley", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/03/03/Pentagon-Scrambles-Win-Hearts-and-Minds-Silicon-Valley", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/09192014_pentagon_mini.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/03/03/Pentagon-Scrambles-Win-Hearts-and-Minds-Silicon-Valley", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/09192014_pentagon_mini.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "The U.S. Defense Department is stepping up its efforts to woo Silicon Valley, hoping to attract the best and brightest into government service and hopefully boost its ability to field cutting-edge technology to the troops.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "The multi-pronged approach announced in earnest on Wednesday introduced a somewhat commonly used recruiting tool in Silicon Valley: a hack-a-thon.\nThe U.S. Defense Department is stepping up its efforts to collaborate with Silicon Valley, hoping to attract the best and brightest into government service and boost its ability to equip American troops with cutting-edge technology.\nCarter\u2019s comments drew applause, but that\u2019s a long way from winning hearts and minds.\nIt also announced that Alphabet Executive Chair Eric Schmidt will head up a new panel \u2013 the Defense Innovation Advisory Board -- to bring Silicon Valley's best corporate practices to the Pentagon.\nThat figure includes roughly $14 billion for offensive operations against the country\u2019s adversaries and military activities in space."}
