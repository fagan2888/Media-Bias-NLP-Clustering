New data documents for the first time that across large areas of the United Kingdom no patients above the age of 75 are \u201creceiving surgery for breast cancer or routine operations such as gall bladder removal and knee replacements.\u201d\n\nUnder the British socialized medicine system, a national board called NICE has made financial decisions regarding healthcare access that assigns less value to treating seniors.\n\nThe National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) provides national guidance and advice to supposedly improve health and social care in the UK. Because of budget considerations, NICE issued a report on May 6, 2005 that \u201cpatients could be denied certain health treatments because of their age.\u201d\n\nThe report caused an uproar at the time. Jonathan Ellis, health policy manager at the \u201cAge Concern\u201d charity, said: \u201cTo suggest that anyone should receive less care and attention simply because they happen to be older is blatant discrimination.\u201d He added that about 80% of physicians in general practice now believed there is discrimination against older people within the NHS system. \u201cIt also runs contrary to the government\u2019s stated aim of tackling the prejudice against older people that exists in health care services,\u201d he stated.\n\nTim Kelsey, director for patients and information at NHS England, the central body in charge of the provision of healthcare services, reported on July 6, 2013 that, \u201cWe are about to run out of cash in a very serious fashion.\u201d NHS England projected that NHS would be facing a $56 billion annual funding gap by 2020. Senior NHS doctors and managers said the system was considering closing 20 hospitals across the country.\n\nThe 144 separate local councils in England that administer the NHS collectively spent $23.5 billion last year for \u201cadult social care\u201d on the 11 million people 65 years or older in the UK. That population is expected to grow by about 250,000 per year thru 2050.\n\nThe London Telegraph on July 2nd quoted a confidential survey of budget chiefs for the 144 councils which showed that total spending on adult social care dropped by $458 million or 2% over the last year ending in June. The survey reveals that budgets have shrunk by 12% since the 2011 financial crisis, but the number of people needing care has risen by 13% because of an ageing UK population and an increase in the number of disabled.\n\nThe Royal College of Surgeons (RCS) study release on July 3rd \u201canalyzed rates of surgery in England for six of the most common operations among different age groups. It exposes a major postcode lottery in practice across the country \u2013 with a 37-fold variation in rates of surgery for breast cancer for women aged 65 and over, depending on where they live. Hip replacements were 10 times as common in some parts of the country as others, with a 6-fold variation in rates of surgery for bowel cancer in 2011-12, the figures show.\u201d\n\nThe RCS report found dramatic differences in council area surgery rates for those aged 65 and above. Twenty-nine council areas provided \u201czero surgery\u201d for those aged 75 and over in the six categories analyzed. For beast surgery to remove cancerous tumors, there was an average of 37 per council area, and in some regional parts of the nation the numbers were \u201cso low that they were calculated as a rate of zero\u201d in other parts.\n\nRCS President Professor Norman Williams said the scale of the differences was \u201cextremely worrying,\u201d raising suspicions that some parts of the NHS were operating covert blanket bans against procedures on age grounds. The controversy in the UK over this type of suspected \u201cdiscrimination\u201d caused the government to pass anti-age discrimination laws regarding denial of beneficial medical procedures based on age.\n\nIn response to media pressure, the British Health Secretary said: \u201cWe expect the NHS to make sure that all patients can access the treatment they need \u2013 discrimination of any kind is unacceptable.\u201d\n\nAcceptable or not, the British National Health Service is rapidly becoming financially insolvent. The cost of NHS now takes an average of 35% of councils\u2019 overall budgets, up from 30% just four years ago, and the proportion is predicted to continue growing.\n\nPresident Obama promised seniors that they would not suffer as the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) moves to nationalize healthcare when it is fully implemented in 2015. But the UK\u2019s experience demonstrates that nationalized care will still go bankrupt even if access to necessary surgical procedures is systematically denied to seniors.\n\nThe author welcomes feedback and will respond to reader comments.\n\nFrom July 15th to July 29th, Chriss Street will be teaching \u201cEntrepreneurship and Capitalist Business Strategy\u201d at Ho Chi Mihn University in Vietnam.", "article_metadata": {"description": "UK Systematically Denies Surgery to Seniors", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "UK Systematically Denies Surgery to Seniors", "title": "UK Systematically Denies Surgery to Seniors - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Breitbart-London/2014/07/05/elderly-patients-hands-AP.jpg", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/london/2014/07/05/uk-systematically-denies-surgery-to-seniors/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "UK Systematically Denies Surgery to Seniors", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Breitbart-London/2014/07/05/elderly-patients-hands-AP.jpg", "title": "UK Systematically Denies Surgery to Seniors - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": ",Breitbart London,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Breitbart London", "published_time": "2014-07-05T06:27:42-07:00", "categories": "Breitbart London"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "\u201cIt also runs contrary to the government\u2019s stated aim of tackling the prejudice against older people that exists in health care services,\u201d he stated.\nThe National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) provides national guidance and advice to supposedly improve health and social care in the UK.\nBut the UK\u2019s experience demonstrates that nationalized care will still go bankrupt even if access to necessary surgical procedures is systematically denied to seniors.\nTwenty-nine council areas provided \u201czero surgery\u201d for those aged 75 and over in the six categories analyzed.\nThe Royal College of Surgeons (RCS) study release on July 3rd \u201canalyzed rates of surgery in England for six of the most common operations among different age groups."}
