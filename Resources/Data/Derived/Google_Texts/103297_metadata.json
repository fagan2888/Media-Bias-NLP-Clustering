More evidence is emerging of the extent of these limits, and now there is new information about wide limits on access to lifesaving drugs.\n\nIn an article by Ariana Eunjung Cha, the December 9 , 2013, Washington Post reports,\n\n\u201cA new analysis of health plans sold in the federal exchange \u2014 which covers 36 states \u2014 and 14 state exchanges found that the benefits tend to be skimpier than in most other private insurance in the United States, with drug benefits a particular weak spot. The analysis, by Avalere Health, a health-care consulting company, was based on a sample of 600 insurance plans.\n\n. . .\n\n\u201cAs the details of the benefits offered by the new health-care plans become clear, patients with cancer, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis and autoimmune diseases also are raising concerns, said Marc Boutin, executive vice president of the National Health Council, a coalition of advocacy groups for the chronically ill.\n\n. . .\n\n\u201c[P]eople who expected the new plans to provide pharmaceutical coverage comparable with that of employer-sponsored plans have been disappointed. . . . [I]nsurers selling policies on the exchanges have pared their drug benefits significantly more, according to health advocates, patients and industry analysts. The plans are curbing their lists of covered drugs and limiting quantities, requiring prior authorizations and insisting on \u2018fail first\u2019 or \u2018step therapy\u2019 protocols that compel doctors to prescribe a certain drug first before moving on to another \u2014 even if it\u2019s not the physician\u2019s and patient\u2019s drug of choice.\u201d\n\nBesides limits on access to drugs, there are more news accounts on limits on access to hospitals and doctors.\n\nIn a December 8, 2013, piece in the highly-regarded British paper Financial Times entitled, \u201cNew Affordable Care US health plans will exclude top hospitals,\u201d reporter Stephanie Kirchgaessner writes:\n\n\u201cAmid a drive by insurers to limit costs, the majority of insurance plans being sold on the new healthcare exchanges in New York, Texas, and California, for example, will not offer patients\u2019 access to Memorial Sloan Kettering in Manhattan or MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, two top cancer centres, or Cedars-Sinai in Los Angeles, one of the top research and teaching hospitals in the country\u2026. It could become another source of political controversy for the Obama administration next year, when the plans take effect. Frustrated consumers could then begin to realise what is not always evident when buying a product as complicated as healthcare insurance: that their new plans do not cover many facilities or doctors \u2018in network.\u2019 In other words, the facilities and doctors are not among the list of approved providers in a certain plan.\u201d\n\nAnd a December 5, 2013, Bloomberg article, \u201cDoc Shock\u2019 On Deck in Obamacare Wars,\u201d Megan McArdle notes\n\n\u201cCome January, when some number of Americans have bought insurance on the new health exchanges and are starting to use the services, you can expect another controversy to arise when many of them find out just how few doctors and hospitals they have access to\u2026. It\u2019s true that narrowing your networks gives you more leverage to negotiate prices with doctors \u2014 if you\u2019re willing to exclude most of the doctors in the state, you\u2019re in a better bargaining position than you are if doctors know that you\u2019re selling customers the ability to see any doctor they want. But the doctors who are in really high demand can simply refuse to take the lower price. And unfortunately, there does seem to be some correlation between how much we spend on health care and how good the results of treatment are.\u201d\n\nWhile some are blaming the insurers, the true culprit is the Obamacare requirement that exchange bureaucrats exclude insurers who offer policies deemed to permit Americans to engage in \u201cexcessive or unjustified\u201d health care spending. As the Post article reports, \u201cInsurers . . . acknowledge that to keep premiums low, they must restrict the use of some costly drugs if there are alternatives.\u201d\n\nUnder the Federal health law, state insurance commissioners are to recommend to their state exchanges the exclusion of \u201cparticular health insurance issuers \u2026 based on a pattern or practice of excessive or unjustified premium increases.\u201d Not only must the exchanges exclude policies from being offered in an exchange when government authorities do not agree with their premiums, but the exchanges must even exclude insurers whose plans outside the exchange offer consumers the ability to reduce the danger of treatment denial by paying what those government authorities consider an \u201cexcessive or unjustified\u201d amount. (See documentation at www.nrlc.org/medethics/healthcarerationing .)\n\nThis evidently is creating a \u201cchilling effect,\u201d deterring insurers who hope to be able to compete within the exchanges from offering adequately funded plans that do not drastically limit access to care.\n\nWhen the government limits what can be charged for health insurance, it restricts what people are allowed to pay for medical treatment. While everyone would prefer to pay less\u2013or nothing\u2013for health care (or anything else), government price controls prevent access to lifesaving medical treatment that costs more to supply than the prices set by the government.\n\nCLICK LIKE IF YOU\u2019RE PRO-LIFE!\n\nAs Kirchgaessner explains,\n\n\u201cMr. Priselac at Cedars-Sinai in Los Angeles says \u2026 the hospitals that are being excluded are leaders in innovation, which saves billions of dollars for the healthcare system in the long run. \u2018There is confusion between price and efficiency,\u2019 he says. \u2018The major teaching and research hospitals are more expensive not because they are inefficient but because of what they do.\u2019\u201d\n\nWhile Obamacare continues to roll out, it is important to continue to educate friends and neighbors about the dangers the law governing them poses in restricting what Americans can spend to save their own lives and the lives of their families.\n\nLifeNews Note: Jennifer Popik is a medical ethics attorney with National Right to Life.
