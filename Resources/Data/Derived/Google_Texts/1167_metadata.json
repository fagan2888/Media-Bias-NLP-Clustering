They're called Bunchems.\n\nThe building balls are meant to be sticky, just not stuck in your hair. The gummy, tacky toy is meant to stick to other Bunchems to create colorful art.\n\nBut parents have been posting images showing a hopelessly matted head of hair blaming the toy's manufacturer.\n\n\"That's why they are like really sticky and they stick to each other and then they stick to your hair. Why would they even make that toy for kids?\" asked shopper Alex Villalon.\n\nParents have ranted on social media about how they've spent hours trying to get them out. And unfortunately for some of the children, their parents chose scissors.\n\n\"I don't think I would want to get that my for my nieces or nephews because then I would be yelled at by my brother and sister because it would be stuck in their hair and they would have to cut it out,\" said shopper Case Siter.\n\nSpinmaster, the company that makes Bunchems, says on the box that it clearly states to keep away from hair.\n\nIf your kids do get Bunchems for gifts and get them in their hair, the toy company says use vegetable oil or hair conditioner to get them out.", "article_metadata": {"wn-build": "XSLT-7.1-17", "Description": "A warning for parents about a popular toy that's creating chaos in your childrens' hair.\u00a0They're called Bunchems.
