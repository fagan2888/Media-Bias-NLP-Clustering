(Photo: Drew Angerer via Getty Images)\n\nTony Podesta, a Democratic super lobbyist with the Podesta Group, told HuffPost that he has encouraged his corporate clients to give to super PACs and dark money nonprofits. \u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate that we have the decision Citizens United, but as long as that\u2019s the law of the land, then Democrats and Republicans are both active in these kinds of endeavors,\u201d he said.\n\nThey're making use of the opportunity. A connected super PAC and nonprofit manned by lobbyists tied to Boehner have collectively received millions from interests in the insurance, drug, energy and other industries. Big-money groups associated with McConnell have been funded by coal companies, insurers and hospitals. Mining and gambling businesses have given directly to the super PAC associated with Reid, which is staffed by two Reid confidantes, one of whom advises the lobby shop that represents those companies while she also prepares to run the senator's 2016 re-election bid. All these companies have hired lobbyists who are connected to those same lawmakers as well as to the big-money groups and who are also working on issues over which Congress has much sway. The groups they fund have spent big to put and keep Boehner, McConnell and Reid in the driver\u2019s seat.\n\n\u201cIt does make a significant difference to have lobbyists involved because then you have the very lobbyists who seek official action from the members being the conduits to the money,\u201d Potter said. \u201cIt makes them valuable to their clients because they have a good relationship with the member, and they have a tight relationship with the member because they have access to the money from their clients.\u201d\n\nTrevor Potter, one of the top election lawyers in the country whose clients include Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) and comedian Stephen Colbert, warns that this arrangement creates exactly the appearance of corruption that courts have used to justify campaign finance limits.\n\nPolitical advisers closely associated with House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio), Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) serve as both operatives on their behalf and lobbyists for corporate clients with business before Congress. The clients are encouraged to give generously to super PACs associated with the respective lawmakers, according to lobbyists familiar with the widespread strategy.\n\nIt is difficult, however, to look closely at the way laws are being made today without acknowledging at least an appearance of corruption. Congressional aides to whom HuffPost spoke all said that their own members of Congress were certainly not influenced in an untoward way by the corporate funds pumped into efforts to re-elect them, but that it was easy to see why the public might assume that to be the case. Five years later, the judicial logic of Citizens United has unraveled.\n\nKennedy and the other four justices, therefore, had to insist that independent political spending could not lead to corruption or the appearance of corruption -- no threat of corruption meant no congressional authority to regulate that spending.\n\nThe Supreme Court majority\u2019s casual dismissal of the possibility that the Citizens United ruling could lead to corruption or the appearance of corruption was necessary from a judicial perspective. Citizens United and a subsequent lower court ruling essentially hold that the First Amendment prevents the government from restricting political spending independent of the candidates and parties. Yet the courts had long recognized Congress\u2019 authority to regulate the financing of campaigns and the lobbying process in order to maintain the citizens\u2019 trust in a democratic government. Where the choice had been between the sanctity of elections on the one hand and an unfettered interpretation of the First Amendment on the other, the courts chose to protect elections -- because without a trusted government, there is no First Amendment to speak of.\n\nTo the lobbyists working in the system he helped create, Kennedy\u2019s vision of political spending is unrecognizable. \"I think Justice Kennedy's view on this was naive at best,\" one lobbyist told The Huffington Post, reflecting a rare bipartisan consensus. \"People are going to do what's allowed under the law.\"\n\nThe Supreme Court initially established a narrow definition of corruption in the 1970s, but Citizens United used it to blow open the gates that had been holding back corporate money. The 2010 decision came as the U.S. legislative system had evolved into a near parliamentary system of party-line voting and expansive party networks extending seamlessly from the Capitol to party headquarters to lobbying firms to outside political groups. Most top congressional legislators now have \"leadership teams\" -- informal but internally recognized groups of aides-turned-lobbyists who help raise funds.\n\nPolitically active nonprofits, known as \"dark money\" groups for their ability to shield the identity of donors, and super PACs, which take unlimited sums of money but must disclose donors, have become dominated by lobbyists and other political operatives with close ties to leaders in Congress. Meanwhile, businesses with issues before Congress are pumping increasingly more money into the lobbyist-connected organizations.\n\nHow the flood of money released by Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission has changed elections has been the subject of much discussion, but the decision\u2019s role in allowing that same money to soak the legislative process has largely gone unreported. According to an extensive review of public documents held by the FEC, the U.S. Senate and the Internal Revenue Service, as well as interviews with lobbyists and policymakers, Kennedy's allegedly independent spending has become increasingly intertwined with lobbying and legislation -- the precise appearance of corruption campaign finance laws were meant to curb.\n\nJust five years later, in a development that may be surprising only to Justice Kennedy, the Supreme Court\u2019s 2010 decision is reshaping how, how much and to whom money flows in Washington.\n\nWhen Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy cast the deciding vote to gut a century of campaign finance law, he assured the public that the unlimited corporate spending he was ushering in would \u201cnot give rise to corruption or the appearance of corruption.\u201d Because those authorized to give and spend unlimited amounts were legally required to remain independent of the politicians themselves, Kennedy reasoned, there was no cause for concern.\n\nSpeaker John Boehner has close ties to the American Action Network, a dark money nonprofit, and the Congressional Leadership Fund, a super PAC. These groups raise funds from clients of lobbyists looking to increase their own influence. (Photo: J. Scott Applewhite/AP)\n\nIn the House of Representatives, Speaker Boehner maintains a tight network of former aides who have decamped to K Street. Through these aides, he is tied to a dark money nonprofit and related super PAC that have spent millions to help him become speaker and to maintain and expand his GOP majority. The House leadership's agenda regularly aligns with that of the clients of the lobbyists who give to these groups.\n\nThe two outside groups in the middle of Boehner\u2019s web are the American Action Network, a 501(c)(4) nonprofit that does not have to disclose its donors, and the Congressional Leadership Fund, a super PAC operating under AAN\u2019s umbrella.\n\nThe board of directors of AAN and Congressional Leadership Fund is lined with lobbyists and influencers including Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck strategic adviser Barry Jackson, a former chief of staff to Boehner who left his office in 2012. Brownstein\u2019s profile of Jackson, who is not registered to lobby, focuses heavily on his congressional and executive branch connections and experience without mention of any particular policy expertise.\n\nAlso, Brownstein Hyatt employed former Boehner aide Marc Lampkin as managing director of its Washington lobbying office. His firm bio declares him to be a proud member of \u201cTeam Boehner,\" and he is widely seen as one of the speaker's closest advisers. He is also a lobbyist for a number of interests that contribute to super PACs and nonprofits that help Republicans in elections.\n\nThe Apollo Education Group, which owns and operates the for-profit University of Phoenix, has donated $50,000 to the Congressional Leadership Fund since 2012 while employing Lampkin to lobby on behalf of such schools. Boehner and his House Republicans have long been staunch supporters of for-profit universities. In recent years, they have fought back against federal regulations to rein in that industry, which relies hugely on its students receiving federal grants and taxpayer-backed loans while it fails to graduate those same students.\n\nThe CEO of pharmaceutical giant Abbott Laboratories, another Lampkin client, gave $50,000 to the Congressional Leadership Fund in 2012. Boehner recently inaugurated a new Abbott factory in his congressional district while opposing changes to tax laws that allowed Abbott to purchase an overseas competitor in 2014 and turn itself into a multinational corporation to avoid U.S. tax payments (the tactic, known as an inversion, has come under increasing scrutiny).\n\nLampkin and another former Boehner aide, Sam Geduldig, have both registered to lobby for the Property Casualty Insurers Association of America, a trade group for large insurance companies that has given $185,000 to outside groups supporting Republicans since 2012. PCI\u2019s contributions include $25,000 each to the Congressional Leadership Fund and AAN.\n\nThe insurers group also pumped funds into the dark money network run by Steven Law, a member of McConnell\u2019s inner circle and a former general counsel at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. PCI gave $75,000 to Crossroads GPS and $25,000 to the Kentucky Opportunity Coalition. Both groups are run by Law and spent millions to re-elect McConnell in 2014. PCI also put money into super PACs supporting two Republicans first elected to the Senate this past November: Joni Ernst of Iowa and David Perdue of Georgia. Their seats were among the handful McConnell needed his party to win in order for him to take the Senate\u2019s top spot.\n\n\"PCI participates in the political process like many others and supports pro business and pro property & casualty organizations,\u201d Marguerite Tortorello, PCI's senior vice president for public affairs, said in a statement.\n\nShortly after the 2014 election, the two top priorities of the insurers group and the broader insurance industry were rolled into one: A provision to roll back capital standards placed on insurance companies by the Dodd-Frank financial reform law was attached to the reauthorization of the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act. Although that bill stalled last year, the new Congress in January passed a terrorism insurance reauthorization with the capital standards rollback attached -- with bipartisan support. An amendment from Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) to strip the rollback measure failed.\n\nThe inability to pass legislation was a hallmark of the last Congress. But one area where lawmakers forced swift action wound up being profitable for the super PACs and nonprofits that support them.\n\nIn April 2013, the Federal Aviation Administration announced that it would be furloughing air traffic controllers throughout the year due to the automatic budget cuts brought about by sequestration. This would have led to flight delays, lost profits for the airline industry and lost wages for controllers and pilots. Within a week of the announcement, Congress passed legislation to ease the sequester cuts at the FAA.\n\nLobbying players who pushed Congress to act on the FAA also sent contributions to various outside groups connected to congressional GOP leaders. Airlines for America, the industry\u2019s main trade group, gave $150,000 to the Congressional Leadership Fund, $35,000 to the pro-McConnell super PAC Kentuckians for Strong Leadership and $40,000 to Defending Main Street SuperPAC, a group backing moderate Republicans in fights with tea party candidates.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t have good policy without good candidates and legislation, which is why it\u2019s important to the 2 million people we fly every day and the nearly 600,000 people we employ that we be involved,\u201d Airlines for America spokesman Vaughn Jennings said in a statement.\n\nThe lobby group is headed by Nick Calio, a veteran of both Bush administrations, who expressed an interest in increasing the airline industry\u2019s political giving upon taking the helm in 2010.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to be part of the political process, and contributions and political support are part of the political process,\u201d Calio told Politico in 2010. \u201cWhen you have people who consistently support you on policy issues, they expect you to be part of their political life support system. It\u2019s just that simple.\u201d\n\nThe National Air Traffic Controllers Association, a labor union, also gave $50,000 to the Congressional Leadership Fund and $150,000 to Defending Main Street after Congress ended the sequester-related furloughs. Those contributions were out of the ordinary for the union, which had been a major supporter of Democrats alone. It has given $3.9 million to super PACs backing Democrats.\n\nCalio is deeply enmeshed in the political party machinery, and his group rewards congressional action by making huge contributions to outside groups that directly support lawmakers. What he does not have is a direct relationship with an outside spending group. Other major lobbyists, including heads of trade associations, do.\n\nTake Mike Duncan, who served as chairman of the Republican National Committee from 2007 to 2009. Following the Citizens United decision, he joined with Karl Rove and other GOP operatives to form the super PAC American Crossroads and the nonprofit Crossroads GPS. He still sits on the board of American Crossroads.\n\nBut Duncan is not just a party operative. In 2012, he became head of the American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity, a major Washington lobbying arm of the coal and railroad industry. The coalition was in the midst of a massive advertising and pressure campaign in Washington as the Obama administration pushed for new regulations on coal-fired power plants to reduce their pollution.\n\nTo further increase its GOP connection, the coal coalition signed up Boehner\u2019s former aide Lampkin to lobby in 2013.\n\nCoal industry companies and executives on the board of the American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity have contributed more than $10 million to Republican outside groups. Joe Craft and his company Alliance Resource Partners have provided most of this money with contributions totaling nearly $9.4 million. Alpha Natural Resources, Consol Energy and Murray Energy have also chipped in. Additionally, Matthew Rose, the CEO of Burlington North Santa Fe and a member of the coal coalition\u2019s board, gave $25,000 to the super PAC supporting McConnell in 2014. (This is all aside from the hundreds of millions in political spending by the Koch brothers, fossil fuel magnates.)\n\nRepublicans have, in turn, become increasingly vocal in their support for the coal industry and their opposition to any rule, regulation or idea -- including belief in climate change driven by human action -- that could harm the industry.\n\nA spokeswoman for the coal coalition said that Duncan separates his work at American Crossroads from that at the lobbying group and does not solicit the latter\u2019s members to give to the former.\n\nThe pro-Boehner AAN, the nonprofit parent of the Congressional Leadership Fund, is a hotbed of lobbyist activity. The board currently boasts four registered lobbyists -- former Sen. Norm Coleman (R-Minn.), former Reps. Tom Reynolds (R-N.Y.) and Vin Weber (R-Minn.), and former RNC official Maria Cino -- and two other employees of lobbying firms -- former Puerto Rico Gov. Luis Fortuno and former Boehner aide Barry Jackson.\n\nPast AAN board members include major GOP fundraiser and previously registered lobbyist C. Boyden Gray and former Rep. Jim Nussle (R-Iowa), who is the head of the Credit Union National Association.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re proud to have a distinguished board from business executives to policy leaders to former elected officials -- they\u2019ve been successful in all walks of life and they\u2019re critical to our success,\u201d Dan Conston, spokesman for both AAN and the Congressional Leadership Fund, said in an email. \u201cDo they fundraise for us? Of course. Do they uphold their fiduciary responsibility to us as board members? Of course.\u201d\n\nCrossroads GPS, like its sister super PAC, also maintains connections to K Street through its board. Crossroads board member Sally Vastola, a former staffer for Rep. Reynolds, decamped with her old boss to the law and lobbying firm of Nixon Peabody, where she lobbies for pharmaceutical companies and the student loan giant Sallie Mae.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.expire_date": "2015-02-27 05:00:18 -0500", "og": {"site_name": "The Huffington Post", "title": "The Inside Story Of How Citizens United Has Changed Washington Lawmaking", "url": "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/02/26/citizens-united-congress_n_6723540.html", "image": "http://i.huffpost.com/gen/2637350/images/o-CITIZENS-UNITED-LOBBYISTS-facebook.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"width": 2000, "identifier": "http://i.huffpost.com/gen/2637350/images/o-CITIZENS-UNITED-LOBBYISTS-facebook.jpg", "height": 1000}, "title": "The Inside Story Of How Citizens United Has Changed Washington Lawmaking", "site": "@HuffPostPol", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "PaulBlu"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-02-26 05:00:18 -0500", "al": {"ios": {"url": "huffpostnews:///?editionID=us&entryID=6723540", "app_store_id": 306621789, "app_name": "The Huffington Post"}}, "taboola.category": "politics", "fb": {"app_id": 46744042133}, "keywords": "lobbying,lobbyists,Citizens United,Super PACs,Harry Reid,Mitch McConnell,Campaign Finance,John Boehner,Chamber of Commerce,american crossroads,senate majority pac,Dark Money,campaign-finance", "article": {"section": "Politics", "tag": "lobbying,lobbyists,Citizens United,Super PACs,Harry Reid,Mitch McConnell,Campaign Finance,John Boehner,Chamber of Commerce,american crossroads,senate majority pac,Dark Money,campaign-finance", "published_time": "2015-02-26 05:00:18 -0500", "modified_time": "2015-02-26 21:59:01 -0500"}, "viewport": "width=1000"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd165d\"", "article_summary": "The pro-Boehner AAN, the nonprofit parent of the Congressional Leadership Fund, is a hotbed of lobbyist activity.\nThe CEO of pharmaceutical giant Abbott Laboratories, another Lampkin client, gave $50,000 to the Congressional Leadership Fund in 2012.\nPCI\u2019s contributions include $25,000 each to the Congressional Leadership Fund and AAN.\nSpeaker John Boehner has close ties to the American Action Network, a dark money nonprofit, and the Congressional Leadership Fund, a super PAC.\nIt\u2019s just that simple.\u201dThe National Air Traffic Controllers Association, a labor union, also gave $50,000 to the Congressional Leadership Fund and $150,000 to Defending Main Street after Congress ended the sequester-related furloughs."}
