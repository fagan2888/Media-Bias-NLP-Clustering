(CBSNewYork/AP) \u2014 The latest polls indicate a tightening race in the sprawling 18th Congressional District in the Hudson Valley.\n\nIncumbent Democrat Sean Patrick Maloney is facing a rematch against Republican Nan Hayworth, the former congresswoman he unseated two years ago.\n\nAs CBS 2\u2019s Lou Young reported, Maloney received some high-profile help Monday when Hillary Rodham Clinton implored a crowd to \u201credouble your efforts\u201d to re-elect Maloney, a longtime friend who also worked as an aide to her husband, President Bill Clinton.\n\n\u201cThe other side is trying to divert attention from the record of Sean\u2019s opponent and the agenda she is running on,\u201d Clinton said at the \u201cWomen for Maloney\u201d rally in a Somers restaurant.\n\nThe race has been especially nasty, with a lot of negative advertising.\n\nHayworth\u2019s \u201cMaloney is full of baloney\u201d ads are part of a blitz personally financed by the Republican millionaire.\n\n\u201cThey resonate,\u201d Hayworth said. \u201cWe want to make sure that our message gets out, that we compete successfully against the avalanche of cash coming in.\u201d\n\nMaloney\u2019s ads attack Hayworth as a Tea Party Republican, a label she once wore proudly but now avoids.\n\n\u201cI am Nan,\u201d Hayworth said. \u201cI am here for the Hudson Valley. There are no labels that hurt me.\u201d\n\nThe incument said the ubiqitous \u201cbaloney\u201d ads don\u2019t bother him.\n\nWhen asked how he would characterize them, Maloney said: \u201cOh, I don\u2019t know, maybe third grade or so \u2014 but that would probably be unfair to third-graders.\u201d\n\nThe district in play covers all of Orange and Putnam counties and parts of Dutchess and Westchester. But there are national overtones in the issues.\n\n\u201cHe has voted to support the Affordable Care Act, Obamacare, over and over again,\u201d Hayworth said.\n\n\u201cShe wants to destroy Planned Parenthood,\u201d Maloney charged. \u201cShe wants to go after Medicare and Social Security.\u201d\n\nHayworth was elected to her one term in the last midterm election. Maloney won office in the general election two years ago. Both sides believe turnout will carry the day.\n\nA Siena College poll in mid-September showed Maloney leading by eight percentage points. The Republican polling firm Public Opinion Strategies released a poll earlier this month showing Hayworth trailing by just four points.\n\nAs the race tightens, there\u2019s a possibility that third-party candidate Scott Smith could play the role of spoiler. He\u2019s a 43-year-old middle school teacher from Goshen running on his own \u201cMr. Smith for Congress\u201d party line.\n\nYou May Also Be Interested In These Stories\n\n\n\n(TM and \u00a9 Copyright 2014 CBS Radio Inc. and its relevant subsidiaries.
