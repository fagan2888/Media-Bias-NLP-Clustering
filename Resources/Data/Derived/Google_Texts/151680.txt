The theater features balcony auditoriums, director suites, a '40s-era diner, computerized concessions, and the biggest movie screens in this part of the country.

The largest theater to be built in the United States in the past decade is coming to Broken Arrow.

Warren Theatres broke ground Tuesday on a new luxury 18-screen movie complex. It's going in on Broken Arrow's south side, on 121st Street between Aspen and Elm.

The theater features balcony auditoriums, director suites, a '40s-era diner, computerized concessions, and the biggest movie screens in this part of the country.

"Everything is just totally numerous steps above what any other theater company is building right now," said founder Bill Warren.

Ticket prices will be about the same as other theaters. It should open in November 2014.
