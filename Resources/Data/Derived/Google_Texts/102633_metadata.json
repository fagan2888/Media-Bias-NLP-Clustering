This year\u2019s goal is $1.675 million, with the 75 figure a salute to the local branch\u2019s 75th anniversary in Fairfield County.\n\nThe local United Way traces its roots to 1926, 14 years before its official incorporation as a nonprofit agency in 1940. But executive director Sherry Orlando said the way it operates hasn\u2019t changed much through the years, even if the first fundraising goal was $20,000.\n\n\u201cThe beauty is that the organization that was created back in 1940 is very similar to what we do today,\u201d she said. \u201cNothing much has changed.

In terms of looking at community needs, the United Way looks at education, income and health. That\u2019s what we do now.\u201d\n\nThere are more than 20 local agencies and organizations the United Way helps, including Maywood Mission, The Recovery Center, the American Red Cross,\n\nLutheran Social Services, the Fairfield Center for Disabilities and Cerebral Palsy, and others.\n\nOrlando said 87 percent of the money the United Way collects goes directly to the organizations it is helping.\n\nOrlando said the United Way started as a way to help those less fortunate through contributions and grants.\n\n\u201cBasically, those individuals who had means thought that they would use their status to get others they knew to give money so that they could put it into a pool or a pot of money,\u201d she said. \u201cSo when situations would arise and individuals would need help, or if there was an issue way back when, then they would use the money from this pot to fund those programs.\u201d\n\nA history lesson\n\nThe first vestiges of the United Way started with the Red Feather Campaign, in which people would go door to door asking for contributions.\n\nThat later became the Community Chest, which morphed into the United Appeal before becoming the United Way. In 1926, those the Community Chest helped included Maywood Mission, the Health League, the Boy Scouts and the YWCA.\n\nJ.W. Deffenbaugh and his son, W.C. Miller, were instrumental in founding the local United Way chapter.\n\nLocal attorney Jim Miller is the grandson of Deffenbaugh and the son of Miller. He said the the agency didn\u2019t make its $75,000 fundraising goal when he came along in 1955.\n\nBut he said that changed five years later when John Gushman came to Anchor Hocking and got involved with United Way fundraising. He instituted employee contributions, which Miller said led to fundraising success.\n\nOrlando said former Eagle-Gazette publisher R. Kenneth Kerr was the campaign chairman in 1940 and 1941. Cy Fulton, of Anchor Hocking, was the co-chairman in 1941. The football field at Lancaster High School is named after Fulton.\n\nThrough the years, some of the biggest names in local business have chaired, including Milton Taylor Sr. of Taylor Chevrolet, Ken Culver of Anchor Hocking, Stanley Banks of Diamond Power, Barry Walker of Trimmer Insurance, and many more.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s amazing to me is how an organization with so much strength has continued through the years to use the same playbook,\u201d Orlando said. \u201cYou\u2019re utilizing individuals in the community that are respected, whether it be the mayor or company CEOs, to gather their friends to talk about what the community needs are and then how much money might be necessary to fund those needs, and then they go out and do it.\u201d\n\nThe downtown campaign goal sign has been in place since at least 1941 when the Lancaster Community Chest used this sign to track donations.\n\n(Photo: The United Way of Fairfield County)\n\nBy 1940, the United Way was helping the Boy Scouts, the YWCA and YMCA, the Lancaster Nursing Welfare Association, the Salvation Army and Maywood Mission. Two more groups were added in 1941, an agency for disabled children and adults and a milk fund, which Orlando said is similar to today\u2019s free and reduced school lunch programs.\n\nThough today\u2019s organization is the same in many ways as in past generations, Orlando said, there are some differences.\n\n\u201cToday, we\u2019re more of a community-impact organization,\u201d she said, \u201cmeaning that we really need to look at how the dollars invested are producing outcomes. The old United Way would have funded a shelter for the homeless and looked at how many nights of shelter and how many individuals they provided shelter to.\n\n\u201cThe United Way of today is more of, \u2018OK, we have individuals at a homeless shelter. But what are we doing to help them gain independence? What are we doing in terms of helping them find employment so that they can find housing?\u2019 And rather than counting the number of nights and number of people, we\u2019re counting how many people are now in permanent housing because of that program. It\u2019s more about a hand up than a hand-out.\u201d\n\nTestimonials\n\n\u201cNo. 1, it\u2019s very exciting that an agency has maintained its existence for so long as the United Way has,\u201d said Rod Cook, executive director of the American Red Cross of East and South Central Ohio. \u201cThere is a misnomer that the Red Cross is a government agency, and it\u2019s not. We rely solely on contributions from the community, especially the United Way.\u201d\n\nRed Cross Major Gift Officer Jeff Miller said the Red Cross contributes about $69,000 each year for the agency\u2019s disaster and veterans services.\n\nMaywood Mission Executive Director Tony Salvatori also is a United Way fan.

I really do. They\u2019ve always been there and always been good to us.\u201d\n\nHe said he loves the local United Way office.\n\n\u201cAnd it\u2019s not just because I\u2019m getting the money,\u201d Salvatori said. \u201cI love those people up there. They\u2019re always helpful, they\u2019re always on your side. They want you to succeed, but they want accountability. And there\u2019s the two keys \u2014 they want to help and they want accountability.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what you have to have. People give good money and they want their money taken care of right. And this United Way does exactly that.\u201d\n\nThe United Way of Fairfield County\u2019s latest campaign officially kicks off Tuesday morning with a breakfast and Community Care Day.\n\njbarron@lancastereaglegazette.com\n\n740-681-4340\n\nTwitter: @JeffDBarron\n\nLearn More\n\nFor more information on the United Way of Fairfield County and to participate in the the 2015 fundraiser, visit www.uwayfairfieldco.org.", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "United Way starts its annual fundraising event and celebrates 75 years in Fairfield County", "og": {"site_name": "Lancaster Eagle Gazette", "description": "United Way starts its annual fundraising event and celebrates 75 years in Fairfield County", "title": "United Way celebrates 75 years in county", "url": "http://www.lancastereaglegazette.com/story/news/local/2015/09/05/united-way-th-anniversary/71785526/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/lancastereaglegazette.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "United Way starts its annual fundraising event and celebrates 75 years in Fairfield County", "title": "United Way celebrates 75 years in county", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/56a8cf398f2e2199248a09938a1223a30568c369/c=293-0-2582-2289&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/09/05/Lancaster/B9318599178Z.1_20150905181506_000_GJGBQKFT5.1-0.jpg", "creator": "@EagleGazette", "site": "@EagleGazette", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=896380990", "fb": {"app_id": 169844466384377}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070"}, "_id": "\"57477afa6914bd0286fe5d0a\"", "article_summary": "Fairfield County United Way-funded agencies The United Way of Fairfield County has been serving the area for 75 years.\nProgramThe LSS Fairfield County Food Pantry provides emergency food to eligible families in Fairfield County in need.\nAnd this United Way does exactly that.\u201dThe United Way of Fairfield County\u2019s latest campaign officially kicks off Tuesday morning with a breakfast and Community Care Day.\n(Photo: The United Way of Fairfield County)By 1940, the United Way was helping the Boy Scouts, the YWCA and YMCA, the Lancaster Nursing Welfare Association, the Salvation Army and Maywood Mission.\nOrlando said the United Way started as a way to help those less fortunate through contributions and grants."}
