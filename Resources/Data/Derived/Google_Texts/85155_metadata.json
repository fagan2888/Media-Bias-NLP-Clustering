But that could be changing, as some are beginning to see the benefits of leaning on business intelligence during the budgeting process.\n\n\u201cThe primary focus is just understanding what business intelligence is and what they should have in place to support their population health initiatives,\u201d said Gregory Shufelt, vice president with The Camden Group. \u201cSaying they need to take it and align it with their day-to-day budgeting process \u2026 is further down the list for them.\u201d\n\nShufelt says using business intelligence gathered from analytics to plan for costs based on risk and population health is a somewhat futuristic concept for many providers.\n\nLooking at historical trends and just moving them forward won\u2019t work anymore. - Tweet this\n\nBut with a growing amount of information available, experts say providers would be remiss if they don\u2019t use at least some of this data during their budgeting process.\n\n\u201cBusiness intelligence and analytics from a population health perspective is tough to use to support budgeting and planning,\u201d said Chuck Bollinger, manager at The Camden Group. \u201cBut looking at historical trends and just moving them forward won\u2019t work anymore.\u201d\n\n[Also: Trinity, Partners form risk-based partnership]\n\nShufelt said most of the progress he has seen from providers is in the use of analytics to create flexible budgets. Instead of rolling out a budget for the next 12 months based on the previous year\u2019s spending, providers can use data to track performance against their budgets in real time. Having ongoing data allows a provider to retool budgets monthly or quarterly based on real-time information.\n\nRon Russell, vice president for research analytics at Verisk Health, Inc., said analyzing risk is important to truly understand costs. This information can help providers understand physician costs, budget reconciliation and how to allocate funds for non fee-for-service contracts.\n\nFollow Healthcare Finance on Twitter and LinkedIn.\n\nMuch of the data needed for this kind of analysis is already being produced by providers\u2019 information systems. Age, gender, diagnostic codes and some prior utilization are the minimum data needed to determine risk, Russell said. The challenge for smaller organizations is that most don\u2019t have a person on staff to extract and tabulate these numbers. That will likely take outside assistance.\n\nProviders can look at their patient panels and the risk scores associated with those groups, then take the average number across those groups and see what kind of risk they are carrying.\n\n\u201cPatients that were expensive in the past year aren\u2019t going to be expensive in the year to come,\u201d Russell said.\n\nFor instance, if their average risk factor is 2.5, they know they are carrying that much greater risk than other, similar groups. They can expect to spend 2.5 times more money. They can reset their reference points to 2.5 and if they go up or down, adjust from there.\n\nThey can also use business intelligence in the reconciliation process to determine what resources are needed to serve their population. If they spend less in a year, it will highlight their efficiencies and if they spent more than projected, they can better understand where the excess is being spent.\n\nIf a particular doctor has a risk factor of .8 and they are spending the same amount as a colleague with a risk factor of 1.2 that is a red flag. Are they ordering some unnecessary labs or diagnostic imaging?\n\nFinally, understanding risk can help providers in the budgeting process when taking on new payment models like bundling. Providers can use population health models to determine the cost of a particular set of patients, like diabetics or those with congestive heart failure.\n\nIf providers have an allotted set of funds for a group of patients, they can figure out how to allocate that appropriately.\n\nMoney allotted for each diabetic patient may be $10,000. If one physician\u2019s risk factor is 1.1, they would need $11,000 to treat the patient. Another provider\u2019s risk might be .8, meaning they could treat a diabetic for $8,000. Physicians with higher risk would need to take more from the pool than those with lower risk.\n\n\u201cA system can allocate funding proportional to the care needs and at the end of the process, they can look back and see if they spent more or less,\u201d Russell said. \u201cThey can use that as a learning process to see how well they are managing care and if they overspent.\u201d\n\nTwitter: @HFNewsTweet", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/news/how-best-use-analytics-hospital-budgeting-process", "image": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/budget-analysis-coins-feature.gif", "site_name": "Healthcare Finance News", "description": "The way hospitals create their annual budgets could be changing amid reforms, as some are beginning to see the benefits of leaning on business intelligence during the process.", "title": "How to best use analytics in the hospital budgeting process"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/budget-analysis-coins-feature.gif"}, "title": "How to best use analytics in the hospital budgeting process", "description": "The way hospitals create their annual budgets could be changing amid reforms, as some are beginning to see the benefits of leaning on business intelligence during the process.", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@HC_Finance"}, "viewport": "width=device-width; initial-scale=1.0; maximum-scale=1.0; user-scalable=no", "description": "Even as health reform changes the way providers are paid and deliver care, most still base their annual budgets on the traditional,\u00a0fee-for-service\u00a0model.
