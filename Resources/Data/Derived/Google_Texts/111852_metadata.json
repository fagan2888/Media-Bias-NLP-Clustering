Now a big seller nationally, Blue Moon is brewed at MillerCoors\u2019 flagship brewery in Golden and another MillerCoors facility in Eden, N.C.\n\nMillerCoors was created from the 2007 merger of the U.S. operations of Denver-based Molson Coors with SABMiller.\n\nIn a Denver Post interview last month, Molson Coors CEO Mark Hunter noted that Blue Moon\u2019s introduction in 1995 came long before most current craft beers were created.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been helping shape (the craft segment) for the last 20 years,\u201d Hunter said.\n\nMillerCoors spokesman Jonathan Stern said the lawsuit is \u201cwithout merit.\u201d\n\n\u201cBlue Moon is the gateway beer into craft for many drinkers and is the most popular craft beer in America,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are countless definitions of \u2018craft,\u2019 none of which are legal definitions. We choose to judge beer by the quality, skill and passion that goes into brewing it.\u201d\n\nThe Boulder-based Brewers Association defines a craft brewery as having annual production of less than 6 million barrels and having less than 25 percent ownership by a noncraft brewer.\n\n\u201cWe believe transparency of brand ownership allows beer drinkers to make an informed choice,\u201d said Paul Gatza, director of the Brewers Association. \u201cWe have no position specifically on the lawsuit. Win or lose, the fight is likely to be expensive to MillerCoors.\u201d\n\nThe San Diego case isn\u2019t the first time that Blue Moon has been a point of legal contention.\n\nIn 2000, Coors agreed to settle a lawsuit filed by a consortium of brewers from Belgium who alleged deceptive trade practices because consumers believed they were buying beer brewed in Belgium, instead of a U.S. ale brewed in Belgian style.\n\nSteve Raabe: 303-954-1948, sraabe@denverpost.com or twitter.com/steveraabedp", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Craft or crafty?
