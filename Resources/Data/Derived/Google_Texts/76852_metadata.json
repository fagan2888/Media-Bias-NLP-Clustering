More than you might think.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act expanded requirements for Medicaid, the federal/state program that helps low-income families and individuals pay for health care.\n\n\u201cMore than 90,000 Georgians were assessed \u2018Medicaid eligible\u2019 by the marketplace and many of those were children,\u201d says Beth Stephens, the Health Access Program Director for Georgia Watch.\n\nMore families qualifying for Medicaid means more kids are in need, according to state officials. That\u2019s why they told Atlanta\u2019s Empty Stocking Fund to expect to hand out gifts to a lot more kids this year.\n\n\u201cIt will be the largest number we\u2019ve ever invited and we expect to probably serve between 7 and 10,000 additional children,\u201d says Manda Hunt, the Fund\u2019s executive director.\n\nThe charity usually serves about 50,000 kids. Hunt says this year that number will jump about 20 percent.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve actually been working with our toy vendors to get that need filled, and we think we\u2019re going to be able to accomplish that side of it, but we really need help accomplishing the payment of that side of it,\u201d she says.\n\nStephens, of Georgia Watch, says such a situation could shine a light on child poverty in the state. Census data show one in every four Georgia children lives in poverty.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Local", "description": "What do a local children\u2019s charity and a federal health care law have in common?
