Bowdle, SD

Three people, including an infant, were killed Friday evening in a two-car crash west of Bowdle, South Dakota.



South Dakota Highway Patrol Trooper Rick Olauson says three passengers in one car died in what appears to be a head-on collision.



Michael Muonio, of Battle Ground, Washington state, was driving one of the cars and died on the scene. A six-month-old infant and 19-year-old Lorissa Bellikka both survived the crash, but later died at hospitals. Both were from Washington as well.



66-year-old Kaster Unser, of Ipswich, was driving the other vehicle involved in the crash. Olauson says he sustained serious, non-life-threatening injuries. He was traveling alone.



The infant died at the Bowdle hospital and Bellikka at St. Alexius Medical Center in Bismarck, North Dakota.
