A temporary funding plan went into effect this month, but once that money runs out, lawmakers will need to settle on a long-term fix that officials characterize as a choice between propping up a failing system at the expense of taxpayers, or turning control over to federal authorities at the risk of unravelling the state\u2019s comprehensive Prepaid Health Care Act.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the danger I\u2019ve warned against,\u201d said Attorney General David Louie. \u201cThe benefits mandated by the state are superior. We don\u2019t want to lose that.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s too early to guess how the Connector dilemma will play out. But as officials sort through the process of implementing the sweeping federal law, it\u2019s clear their key concern is finding a compromise that preserves Hawaii\u2019s high standards.\n\nHawaii was the first U.S. state to enact employer-mandated health care. The 40-year-old law requires employers, even those with only one worker, to provide subsidized insurance plans. Penalties for noncompliance go beyond fines \u2014 those that flout the law face having their businesses shut down. The federal Affordable Care Act, by contrast, requires nothing of employers currently but will eventually require large companies to either provide insurance or pay a fine.\n\nThe Hawaii law extends to those working as few as 20 hours per week, whereas the federal law kicks in at 30 hours. And Hawaii regulations put a harder cap on how much income employees have to contribute in comparison to federal requirements.\n\nTo preserve these benefits and show support for President Barack Obama, who championed the law, Hawaii officials decided to build and operate their own health care exchange and announced those plans before any other state.\n\nBut the Connector has failed in several areas:\n\n\u2014 It enrolled just 10,800 people, far below the 100,000 that some supporters predicted. This was at least partially because so many residents already insured under Hawaii\u2019s law, officials say.\n\n\u2014 In its first six months, the Connector earned just $40,350 in revenue, falling short of the $320,000 expected.\n\n\u2014 Only two insurance companies have participated, and technical problems prompted some to bypass the exchange and seek coverage directly from insurance companies.\n\n\u201cHawaii is in a different position than almost any place else in the country,\u201d said Michael Gold, the CEO of Hawaii Medical Services Association, the state\u2019s largest health insurer. The exchange \u201cdoesn\u2019t really fit Hawaii,\u201d he said.\n\nBecause of its unique position, state officials asked for exemptions under an innovation waiver. Federal officials, however, say such shelter won\u2019t be available until 2017.\n\nCritics have argued state officials should have seen foreseen the problems, but the exchange\u2019s interim director, Tom Matsuda, said such foresight was impossible because \u201cthe federal rules changed frequently as we were building the system.\u201d\n\nHawaii\u2019s situation is similar to that of Massachusetts, the first state to require individuals to carry health insurance and the inspiration for the federal overhaul..\n\nMassachusetts officials struggled to build an exchange, enrolling fewer than 32,000 people. They\u2019re considering spending $121 million fixing the troubled system or handing control over to federal authorities.\n\nHawaii hasn\u2019t received definitive guidance about what would happen in a federal takeover, but state officials fear it would erode benefits.\n\nOfficials at the federal Department of Health and Human Services would not comment on Hawaii\u2019s situation.\n\nExperts have conflicting opinions.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know whether the federal government would accommodate in any way the Prepaid Health Care Act,\u201d said Bay, the University of Hawaii professor.\n\nDianne Winter Brookins, an attorney who specializes in health care law, was more optimistic, saying \u201cemployers will have to continue to comply with the Prepaid Health Care Act, even if the feds take over the exchange.\u201d\n\nTo get by, Hawaii lawmakers approved a $1.5 million funding patch to last through the end of the year, but exchange officials say it could cost from $4.5 to $15 million annually to operate.\n\nGold said Hawaii should shut the exchange down, but state officials see that as untenable.\n\n\u201cIf the Connector is allowed to fail, we think that puts the Prepaid Health Care Act in jeopardy,\u201d Matsuda said.\n\nAmong those facing the most acute risk would be those working part-time for companies with fewer than 100 employees, such as Amber Lee, an assistant manager at a cosmetics store in Honolulu, who was recently spared the cost of a $70,000 surgery, thanks to the Hawaii law.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t imagine not being covered, how much stress that would be,\u201d she said.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Honolulu Star-Advertiser", "description": "A temporary funding plan for the Hawaii Health Connector went into effect this month, but once that money runs out, lawmakers will need to settle on a long-term fix that officials characterize as a choice between propping up a failing system at the expense of taxpayers, or turning control over to federal authorities at the risk of unravelling the state's comprehensive Prepaid Health Care Act.", "title": "Hawaii health care faces federal threat | Honolulu Star-Advertiser", "url": "http://www.staradvertiser.com/breaking-news/hawaii-health-care-faces-federal-threat/", "image": "http://www.staradvertiser.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/17-b5-connector-pix2.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/staradvertiser/", "section": "Top News", "tag": "news", "published_time": "2014-07-29T07:17:23-10:00"}, "fb": {"pages": 112299605447935}, "twitter": {"description": "A temporary funding plan for the Hawaii Health Connector went into effect this month, but once that money runs out, lawmakers will need to settle on a long-term fix that officials characterize as a choice between propping up a failing system at the expense of taxpayers, or turning control over to federal authorities at the risk of unravelling the state's comprehensive Prepaid Health Care Act.", "title": "Hawaii health care faces federal threat | Honolulu Star-Advertiser", "image": "http://www.staradvertiser.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/17-b5-connector-pix2.jpg", "creator": "@staradvertiser", "site": "@staradvertiser", "card": "summary"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf85f\"", "article_summary": "Hawaii health care faces federal threatJanice Nakamura knows the financial burden of going without health care, and she\u2019s thankful for the Hawaii law that strictly mandates expansive, employer-provided coverage for her and her family.\nThe Hawaii law extends to those working as few as 20 hours per week, whereas the federal law kicks in at 30 hours.\nThe problem starts with the Hawaii Health Connector, a federally mandated insurance marketplace that\u2019s losing money.\nThe Nakamuras are among the 763,000 Hawaii residents \u2014 more than half the state\u2019s population \u2014 who rely on a unique, longstanding system that has been jeopardized by the federal health care overhaul.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know whether the federal government would accommodate in any way the Prepaid Health Care Act,\u201d said Bay, the University of Hawaii professor."}
