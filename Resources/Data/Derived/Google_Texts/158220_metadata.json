We the Voters\u201d bus tour, seeking to use their moral weight to highlight the evils of \u201cdark money\u201d in politics and encourage disenfranchised people to register to vote and show up on election day.\n\nThe nuns, who stood before an assembled crowd of hundreds, were joined by Vice President Joseph Biden, a Roman Catholic, and led by Sister Simone Campbell, a Catholic nun and Executive Director of NETWORK, a Catholic social justice lobby. Campbell and the Vice President both spoke briefly to the crowd, with Campbell citing the pitfalls of money in politics and Biden singing the praises of the nuns\u2019 activism.\n\n\u201cI know no group of people who bring a greater sense of justice and passion to what they do,\u201d Biden said of the nuns, according to the New York Times.\n\nAfter their initial stop in Iowa, Campbell and NETWORK plan to hold 75 more events in 36 cities over the next five weeks, most of which will focus on voter registration and voter mobilization. The effort, Campbell told ThinkProgress, is about empowering poor and disenfranchised voters \u2014 people whose voices often go unheard amid the flood of wealthy political action groups that are exacting ever-growing influence over American politics. These organizations are aided in part by the 2010 U.S. Supreme Court decision Citizens United v. FEC, which loosened restrictions that had long prohibited corporations from spending large sums money to impact elections. Campbell and her fellow nuns argue that the influence of big money in politics drowns out the concerns of regular Americans.\n\n\u201cMoney doesn\u2019t convey truth,\u201d Campbell said. \u201cEveryone should be able to use their voice. Everybody should be able to come to the table. But you can\u2019t buy the table \u2014 sorry, it\u2019s wrong.\u201d\n\nCampbell also noted that she and several groups of nuns plan on personally seeking out unlikely voters during the tour, knocking on doors and joining up with local organizations that work to boost turnout within impoverished communities. She said the goal was to advocate for a society that supports \u201cthe 100 percent,\u201d and that she was originally inspired to take to the road after she saw a poll earlier this year reporting that the majority of Americans weren\u2019t even aware of the midterm elections in November.\n\n\u201cSo many people are so depressed and beaten down by the our society,\u201d Campbell said. \u201cOur [materials] are in English and Spanish. We want to make those who feel most depressed, most isolated, most pushed out \u2026 Feel needed in our society.\u201d\n\nThe bus tour does not endorse one specific political party, but it does appear to be targeted towards activating voters in states with close Senate races \u2014 especially those that are being influenced by massive influxes of outside money, such as Louisiana, Colorado, North Carolina, and Iowa. Simone specifically criticized the role the Koch brothers have played in Iowa\u2019s Senate battle, where the two conservative billionaires have used a combination of personal donations and political organizations such as Americans for Prosperity to spend around $7 million in support of Republican Senate candidate Joni Ernst. Unlike her opponent Bruce Braley \u2014 who has proposed raising Iowa\u2019s minimum wage to $10.10 an hour \u2014 Ernst has endorsed a shockingly low $7.25 minimum wage for the state and has been accused of opposing a federal minimum wage.\n\n\u201cHere in Iowa\u2026One of the candidates wants to raise the minimum wage. The other thinks the minimum wage should be done away with altogether,\u201d Campbell said, referencing Ernst. \u201cThese choices are important.\u201d\n\nCampbell and her fellow nuns are part of a long history of Catholics advocating for social justice within the United States. Their particular concern for the impoverished, for instance, is an ancient Christian belief that has seen something of a resurgence in recent years, aided in part by the rise of Pope Francis, who has made caring for the poor a central element of his papacy. Francis, the nuns, and many other Catholics are guided by Catholic Social Teaching, which insists on a preferential \u201coption for the poor\u201d as expressed in Matthew 25:45, where Jesus declares, \u201cwhatever you did not do for one of the least of these, you did not do for me.\u201d\n\nIn fact, this isn\u2019t the first time Campbell and NETWORK have sought to advocate for \u201cthe least of these\u201d \u2014 the new bus tour is actually their third cross-country romp in as many years. The original \u201cNuns On The Bus\u201d outing occurred in 2012, when Campbell traveled to nine states across the Midwest to raise awareness about income inequality and blast then-Vice Presidential candidate Paul Ryan\u2019s (R-WI) budget plan because it threatened to slash social programs that help the poor. NETWORK went on to launch another bus trip to help galvanize support for immigration reform in 2013, and Campbell\u2019s star has only continued to rise: since the first tour, Simone has delivered an address during primetime at the 2012 Democratic National Convention, testified before Congress on the need to protect government programs such as Head Start, and published a book entitled \u201cA Nun on the Bus: How All of Us Can Create Hope, Change, and Community.\u201d\n\nBut as the influence of NETWORK and Campbell has grown, so too has criticism of their actions \u2014 primarily from within the Catholic church. Nuns are actually more popular than bishops or priests in the United States, and their activism played a key role in helping pass the Affordable Care Act in 2010, which the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops publicly opposed. But their advocacy has rubbed many in the Catholic hierarchy the wrong way: Campbell and the Leadership Conference of Women Religious (LCWR), a group that represents most U.S. sisters, were put under investigation by the Vatican in 2012 for supposedly spending to much time on social justice work and not enough time defending church doctrine on abortion and homosexuality. There was some hope that Pope Francis would call off the inquiry when he ascended to the papacy last year, but he reaffirmed the investigation in April 2013.\n\nStill, Campbell insists that the new bus tour is bigger than Catholicism. The dangers of money in politics, she argues, should be understood by all Americans, not just Catholics or other people of faith.\n\n\u201cI do this because of faith, but we don\u2019t all have to do it because of that,\u201d Campbell said. \u201cWe do it because of the Constitution.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "\"Everybody should be able to come to the table.
