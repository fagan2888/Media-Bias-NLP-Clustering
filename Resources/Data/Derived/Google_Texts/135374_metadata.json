And, for the Washington Nationals, it typically involves some sort of mechanical failure.\n\nAnother season will begin Monday afternoon at Nationals Park, when the Nationals host the New York Mets, and, once again, the group that takes the field for the season opener will include a collection of spare parts. Michael Taylor, not Denard Span, should start in center field. Tyler Moore, not Jayson Werth, should start in left field. Dan Uggla, a three-time All-Star who joined the team on a minor league deal, will likely start at second base. And at third, Anthony Rendon could be replaced by Yunel Escobar, a longtime shortstop who readjusted to second base earlier this spring before being asked to move again.\n\nGot all that?\n\nIn total, the Nationals will begin the 2015 season with five players on the disabled list: Rendon, Span, Werth, relief pitcher Casey Janssen and reserve outfielder Nate McLouth.\n\nThe injuries have put a slight damper on the lofty expectations that have followed the team since late January, when it signed marquee free agent Max Scherzer to a seven-year, $210 million deal. In the Nationals clubhouse, however, the odds-on World Series favorites are undeterred. Injuries are nothing new for this group.\n\n\u201cEverybody\u2019s going to get hurt. Every team\u2019s going to have injuries. Every team\u2019s going to have adversity. But we\u2019ve dealt with it,\u201d closer Drew Storen said last week. \u201cYou look at [2012], we had injuries. Last year, we had injuries. All that does is give the supporting guys an opportunity to grow and develop and step up, and then, when those guys come back, they can play big roles too.\u201d\n\nThe Nationals have won two National League East division titles in the past three seasons, all while navigating repeated injuries to important starters, particularly early in the season. In 2012, they began the year with four players \u2014 including Storen and starting left fielder Michael Morse \u2014 on the disabled list. In 2013, catcher Wilson Ramos and third baseman Ryan Zimmerman each strained a hamstring in the opening month. Last year, Ramos broke a bone in his left hand on Opening Day.\n\nAltogether, 26 players who were on Washington\u2019s Opening Day roster in the past three years have missed a total of 1,546 games.\n\n\u201cIt gives us experience. The wrong experience \u2014 we don\u2019t want that \u2014 but it shows us that we can compete, that we can go out and win a game regardless of who\u2019s in the lineup,\u201d manager Matt Williams said. \u201cYou want to have all your guys. That\u2019s important. But if you don\u2019t have them, our attitude is, well, OK, we\u2019ve got to go win the game.\u201d\n\nFortunately for Washington, most of its injured players this year are not expected to miss extended periods of time. Werth, who is recovering from offseason shoulder surgery, and Span, who had sports hernia and abdominal surgeries, are each already playing in minor league games in Viera, Florida. Rendon has been diagnosed with a sprained medial collateral ligament in his left knee. Janssen has rotator cuff tendinitis in his right shoulder.\n\nThe Nationals will be buoyed by a healthy starting rotation that is considered one of the best in recent years. Scherzer, the 2013 American League Cy Young award winner, will start Opening Day, followed by two-time All-Star Jordan Zimmermann and former No. 1 overall pick Stephen Strasburg. Gio Gonzalez and Doug Fister, who would be top arms on most other major league pitching staffs, round out the group.\n\nThat rotation, and a deep minor league system ripe with potential fill-ins, is cause for optimism, even as injuries mount.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re not going to win 120 games, you wouldn\u2019t think, but I think pushing the 100-mark is a very doable thing,\u201d said former Atlanta Braves pitcher John Smoltz, who now works as an analyst for MLB Network. \u201cI think the combination of offense and pitching and bullpen gives them the edge over most, because they have depth. They can sustain certain injuries that other clubs can\u2019t.\u201d\n\nWhile their starters recover, the Nationals will lean on a mix of new additions and familiar faces, budding stars and trusty veterans. Taylor, who recently turned 24, is considered Span\u2019s eventual successor in center field. Moore, 28, has been a mainstay on the bench for several years. On March 30, the team acquired two key bench players, trading for outfielder Matt den Dekker and signing Reed Johnson, a 12-year veteran, as a free agent. Uggla and Clint Robinson, nonroster invitees essentially asked to try out for the team, will also be on the Opening Day roster.\n\nRegardless of who takes the field for Washington early in the season, and in what capacity, Williams and his players remain confident. In their eyes, no sprain or bruise can keep them from their ultimate goal of winning the World Series.\n\n\u201cThe important thing is honestly looking at the marathon,\u201d Storen said. \u201cI know everybody is excited about Opening Day. You have to understand that just because you aren\u2019t there Opening Day doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re gone the rest of the season. There are a ton of games, and Game 1 matters just as much as Game 162.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The injuries have put a slight damper on the lofty expectations that have followed the team since late January, when it signed marquee free agent Max Scherzer to a seven-year, $210 million deal.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "The injuries have put a slight damper on the lofty expectations that have followed the team since late January, when it signed marquee free agent Max Scherzer to a seven-year, $210 million deal.", "title": "Injuries won\u2019t stop World Series chase as Nationals set sights on prize in October", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/apr/5/injuries-wont-stop-world-series-chase-nationals-se/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/04/01/Nationals_Marlins_Baseball.JPEG-02e50.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/04/01/Nationals_Marlins_Baseball.JPEG-02e50.jpg", "description": "The injuries have put a slight damper on the lofty expectations that have followed the team since late January, when it signed marquee free agent Max Scherzer to a seven-year, $210 million deal.", "card": "summary", "title": "Injuries won\u2019t stop World Series chase as Nationals set sights o"}, "Author": "Tom Schad", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Sports, Denard Span, Dan Uggla, Michael Taylor, Tyler Moore"}, "article_summary": "Scherzer, the 2013 American League Cy Young award winner, will start Opening Day, followed by two-time All-Star Jordan Zimmermann and former No.\nYou have to understand that just because you aren\u2019t there Opening Day doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re gone the rest of the season.\nLast year, Ramos broke a bone in his left hand on Opening Day.\n\u201cI know everybody is excited about Opening Day.\nAltogether, 26 players who were on Washington\u2019s Opening Day roster in the past three years have missed a total of 1,546 games."}
