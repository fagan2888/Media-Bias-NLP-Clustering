She also won a downhill four years ago. And she has three super-G wins and one slalom victory in Garmisch-Partenkirchen.\n\nThe Vail resident keeps breaking her own records with every victory. Vonn raised her World Cup record to 38 downhill wins, the most by a woman in a specific discipline.\n\n\u201cEvery win is more special than the last one. Every day is a new chance to break a record,\u201d Vonn said.\n\nOn a sunny day but with most of the Kandahar course in shade, Vonn made no obvious mistakes and finished 1.51 seconds ahead of Fabienne Suter of Switzerland. Viktoria Rebensburg of Germany, winner of two consecutive giant slalom races coming into Saturday\u2019s event, finished third, 1.57 seconds behind Vonn.\n\nWith her 76th World Cup win, Vonn closed the gap on the all-time record of 86 victories held by Ingemar Stenmark of Sweden. Vonn has won five of six downhill races this season and six of the last seven going back to last season. With 57 down- hill podium finishes, she is behind only Austria\u2019s Renate Goetschl (59).\n\n\u201cYou can never be unsatisfied with a 1\u00bd-second lead,\u201d Vonn said, beaming. \u201cIt was a great day. I am pretty psyched.\u201d\n\nWith her fifth downhill victory, Vonn equaled her record from the 2011-12 season. She now has nine wins overall this season.\n\n\u201cEverything is coming together well and I have a lot of confidence,\u201d Vonn said.\n\n\u201cIt feels like home here,\u201d she said, speaking in fluent German to reporters after the race.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Lindsey Vonn raises World Cup record to 38 downhill wins", "title": "Lindsey Vonn raises World Cup record to 38 downhill wins", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/02/06/lindsey-vonn-raises-world-cup-record-to-38-downhill-wins/", "image": {"width": 526, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160206__BN20160207_C5_BNSP07SKIWRAPp1.jpg", "height": 654}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160206__BN20160207_C5_BNSP07SKIWRAPp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2016-02-06T18:44:36+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-18T06:02:17+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Vonn raised her World Cup record to 38 downhill wins, the most by a woman in a specific discipline.\nI am pretty psyched.\u201dWith her fifth downhill victory, Vonn equaled her record from the 2011-12 season.\nWith her 76th World Cup win, Vonn closed the gap on the all-time record of 86 victories held by Ingemar Stenmark of Sweden.\nEvery day is a new chance to break a record,\u201d Vonn said.\nVonn has won five of six downhill races this season and six of the last seven going back to last season."}
