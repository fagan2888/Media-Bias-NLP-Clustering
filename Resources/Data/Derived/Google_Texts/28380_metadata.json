Some cheered online when Tapper tried to portray Trump as the know-nothing enemy of scientific expertise that supposedly justifies progressives\u2019 power over ordinary Americans\u2019 personal, civic and political lives.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nTapper\u2019s political question is similar to the out-of-nowhere contraception question asked in Jan. 2012 by former Democratic aide George Stephanopoulos to Gov. Mitt Romney, then the leading GOP candidate. Romney was incredulous when asked if contraception should be banned, and he dismissed the question. But Stephanopoulos\u2019 question was still used by Democrats throughout the 2012 election to smear Romney and the GOP as anti-sex.\n\nTapper began the science ambush by asking Carson about the role of vaccines in the huge and unexplained rise of autism among American children. Since 2000, the rate has roughly doubled, to 1 in 88 children.\n\n\u201cDonald Trump has publicly and repeatedly linked vaccines, childhood vaccines, to autism, which, as you know, the medical community adamantly disputes,\u201d Tapper asked Carson. \u201cYou\u2019re a pediatric neurosurgeon. Should Mr. Trump stop saying this?\u201d\n\nDr. Carson refused to play along. \u201cThere has \u2014 there have been numerous studies, and they have not demonstrated that there is any correlation between vaccinations and autism,\u201d he began. But he added some general support for Trump\u2019s position.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s an OK doctor\u2026 it is true that we are probably giving way too many [vaccines] in too short a period of time,\u201d Carson said, pushing through Tapper\u2019s interventions.\n\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s all I\u2019m saying, Jake. That\u2019s all I\u2019m saying,\u201d said Trump, collecting his political win.\n\n\u201cAutism has become an epidemic,\u201d Trump said. \u201cTwenty-five years ago, 35 years ago, you look at the statistics, not even close. It has gotten totally out of control.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am totally in favor of vaccines. But I want smaller doses over a longer period of time\u2026 I had my children taken care of over a long period of time, over a two or three year period of time.\u201d\n\nBut Tapper kept pushing. \u201cDr. [Rand] Paul? Dr. Paul, I\u2019d like to bring you in.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m also a little concerned about how the [vaccines] are bunched up,\u201d Paul said, echoing Trump.\n\n\u201cMy kids had all of their vaccines, and even if the science doesn\u2019t say bunching them up is a problem, I ought to have the right to spread out my vaccines out a little bit at the very least,\u201d said Doctor Paul, again backing Trump\u2019s position.\n\nThe progressives\u2019 subsequent howling was splashed on the Washington Post\u2019s web page, under the hostile headline, \u201cThe GOP\u2019s Dangerous Debate on Vaccines And Autism.\u201d Tapper \u201claid out the question for Ben Carson like a baseball on a tee, just waiting to be crushed\u2026 [but] Carson bunted,\u201d the story says.\n\nThe article listed the protests and complaints from progressives in the media, from a few advocacy groups and from a few of the nation\u2019s many doctors.\n\nBut those complaints can\u2019t do the impossible \u2014 they can\u2019t prove that there are no bad results anytime, anywhere when kids get multiple dozes of very beneficial vaccines that have marvelously minimized the pre-1950s death rates among children. That\u2019s an impossible-to-prove negative because human genetics and the human environment are far too varied, diverse, nuanced and complex for anyone to declare that no harm will ever come to any child.\n\nInstead of recognizing diversity, progressives simply demand that ordinary people shut up when experts like them declare what\u2019s best for their children.\n\nFor 15 years, scientists and their progressive allies have been insisting on the impossible-to-prove \u2014 that there\u2019s no problem with the progressives\u2019 public-health policies. And they\u2019ve been coldly reluctant to recognize even the possibility that some rare, very rare, combination of vaccines, genes, circumstances and professional imperfection can be disastrous for some infants and their parents.\n\nIn response to this progressive politicization of science, many creative parents have quietly adopted the recommendations shared by the two GOP doctors \u2014 get the vaccines, but get them one-by-one over a longer period of time to reduce the very small chance of harm to their hugely valuable American children.\n\n\u201cIt is true that we are probably giving way too many [vaccines] in too short a period of time,\u201d Carson told the disappointed Tapper. \u201cA lot of pediatricians now recognize that\u2026 and I think that\u2019s appropriate,\u201d Carson said, twisting the knife.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m in favor of vaccines, do them over a longer period of time, same amount,\u201d Trump told Tapper.\n\nThat\u2019s the obvious civic and small-c-conservative, small-d-democratic middle-ground between the many progressives\u2019 extreme insistence that their vaccine policies are just completely perfect, and some parent\u2019s unjustified \u2014 and even selfish \u2014 extreme refusal to vaccinate their kids from school-shared diseases that once killed many children.\n\nThe reasonable American-as-as-apple-pie middle is to muddle along with more science, more testing of alternatives, more civic adjustments, and maybe some parts of the multi-cause problem will get fixed in a few years.\n\nBut this live-TV political win for Trump and his two doctor allies may not last.\n\nIn January 2012, Stephanopoulos pulled the contraception question out of his assistant\u2019s folder and threw it at Romney.\n\n\u201cGovernor Romney, do you believe that states have the right to ban contraception? Or is that trumped by a constitutional right to privacy?\u201d the Democrat asked.\n\n\u201cGeorge, this is an unusual topic that you\u2019re raising,\u201d Romney replied, \u201cDo states have a right to ban contraception? I can\u2019t imagine a state banning contraception. I can\u2019t imagine the circumstances where a state would want to do so\u2026Given that there\u2019s no state that wants to do so, and I don\u2019t know of any candidate that wants to do so.\u201d\n\nStephanopoulos, the Democrat activist, kept pushing. \u201cDo you believe states have that right or not?\u201d he asked Romney.\n\nRomney pushed back. \u201cThe idea of you putting forward things that states might want to do, that no state wants to do, and then asking me whether they can do it or not is kind of a silly thing.\u201d\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t a silly thing. It was a Democratic set-up to portray Romney as a sex-hating, out-of-touch, old man.\n\nAnd President Barack Obama and his campaign aides used the question \u2014 but not Romney\u2019s sensible answer \u2014 throughout the election to paint the GOP as anti-sex, anti-women, anti-young people, and eager to ban contraception.\n\nThey fed that narrative by using their Obamacare power and their media allies to push and shove the Catholic church up against the wall that protects churches form state mandates. To some extent, the tactic worked \u2014 and it may this time as well.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Trump, Carson and Paul Foil Tapper's Vaccine Ambush", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Trump, Carson and Paul Foil Tapper's Vaccine Ambush", "title": "Trump, Carson and Paul Foil Tapper's Vaccine Ambush", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/09/ap_ap-photo1067-wi-e1442500463861.jpg", "height": 479}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/09/17/donald-trump-ben-carson-rand-paul-foil-jake-tapper-vaccine-ambush/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Trump, Carson and Paul Foil Tapper's Vaccine Ambush", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/09/ap_ap-photo1067-wi-e1442500463861.jpg", "title": "Trump, Carson and Paul Foil Tapper's Vaccine Ambush", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Carson, contraception, Paul, stephanopoulos, tapper, Trump, Vaccine,2016 Presidential Race, Big Government, Science,Trump", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "2016 Presidential Race", "tag": "Vaccine", "published_time": "2015-09-17T10:38:30-07:00", "categories": "Big Government,2016 Presidential Race,Science"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERTapper\u2019s political question is similar to the out-of-nowhere contraception question asked in Jan. 2012 by former Democratic aide George Stephanopoulos to Gov.\n\u201cDonald Trump has publicly and repeatedly linked vaccines, childhood vaccines, to autism, which, as you know, the medical community adamantly disputes,\u201d Tapper asked Carson.\nDr. Paul, I\u2019d like to bring you in.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m also a little concerned about how the [vaccines] are bunched up,\u201d Paul said, echoing Trump.\nIn January 2012, Stephanopoulos pulled the contraception question out of his assistant\u2019s folder and threw it at Romney.\nTapper began the science ambush by asking Carson about the role of vaccines in the huge and unexplained rise of autism among American children."}
