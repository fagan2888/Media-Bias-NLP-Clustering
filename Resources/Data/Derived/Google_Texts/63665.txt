Not only is November Diabetes Awareness month, but November 14 is World Diabetes Day.

Saturday, more than 200 people gathered and walked across the Hathaway Bridge to help raise awareness for the disease.

World Diabetes Day is recognized on November 14, because it's the birthday of Frederick Banting, one of the co-founders of insulin.

This is the 3rd year Bay County celebrated World Diabetes Day and organizers say it has been the largest turnout yet.

"This year, I'm thinking we're close to 300 plus (people)," Jo Colvile the chair of the World Diabetes Day Bridge Walk. "I'm very excited about the growth. We're a new organization to get things going. I'm glad people are concerned about their health and want to learn more about diabetes and its drastic effects on the human body."
