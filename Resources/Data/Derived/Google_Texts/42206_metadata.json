And Republicans shouldn\u2019t assume that it would be.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nIn 2012, many Republicans thought it would be easy to defeat Barack Obama. With the economy still struggling, the Obama Doctrine unclear and unpromising, and many of Obama\u2019s campaign promises unfulfilled, I was told repeatedly by many high-level Republican strategists that Mitt Romney would pull through without a doubt.\n\nI had my doubts.\n\nI certainly have my opinion on what could beat Hillary. I think it would take a libertarian-leaning platform focusing on economic opportunity, reforming the tax code and letting people keep more of their hard-earned cash, limited government, protecting people\u2019s civil liberties, a strong free market-based Obamacare alternative, and standing up for personal choice and freedoms. No matter where you stand on social issues, opposition to gay marriage will be a problem for the GOP. Poll after poll after poll tell you that. I\u2019m not telling you what to believe, just acknowledging reality.\n\nAs far as the candidate, charisma is a requirement. It just is. See 2008 and 2012 GOP losses for details. And to those who have recently in any way compared Romney to Reagan, stop. Just stop. Great policy doesn\u2019t win if someone can\u2019t convey it in a way that resonates with people. Reagan could; Romney couldn\u2019t. If you can\u2019t excel at outreach and your delivery inspires more yawns than cheers, you\u2019re not winning. Period.\n\nFinally, do I trust the GOP marketing and communications teams today to secure that win? No. Perhaps their latest anti-Hillary squirrel campaign has something to do with that.\n\nSo Rubio, you may be right. But the GOP has some obstacles to overcome first. Hillary may not be \u201cunbeatable,\u201d but you have to have a candidate, vision, and surrounding team that can win.\n\nWe\u2019re waiting.\n\nJedediah Bila is co-host of \u201cOutnumbered\u201d on Fox News at 12pm ET.
