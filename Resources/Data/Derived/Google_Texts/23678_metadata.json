Marco Rubio held a town hall in Valley View Friday to an overflow crowd of around 200, his second event in the greater Cleveland area this month.\n\nRubio was introduced by Ohio Treasurer Josh Mandel, who endorsed the Florida senator in his bid for president.\n\nHis introduction to this crowd was smoother than his Aug. 5 event on West 25th Street, when he told the crowd he came to Cleveland to try to convince LeBron to go back to Miami.\n\nThis time, Rubio diplomatically danced around the question of whether Ohio State would repeat its victory, instead sharing his admiration for Buckeyes Coach Urban Meyer who won two National Championships at Florida.\n\nRubio quickly reminded the crowd of one of those victories was over Ohio State. \u201cThere are some things that are above politics,\u201d he joked of his sports allegiances. \u201cMy anti-Tom Brady position is not helping me in New Hampshire.\u201d\n\nRubio telling the crowd this is a generational moment for this country highlighting the changes America has seen in the last decade and the changes needed in Washington for the U.S. to remain competitive in the world.\n\n\u201cI want this to continue to be a country where people can continue to do for their children what my parents did for me,\u201d Rubio said, the son of Cuban immigrants, said.\n\n\u201cThe real thing that\u2019s happening here is a transformation in our economy. Our economy is dramatically different than what it used to be. One of the largest retailers in the world is Amazon and they don\u2019t own a single store. One of the largest transportation companies in America is Uber and they don\u2019t own cars,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThis is a very different economy from the one I grew up in. It\u2019s a very different economy than the one we had five or ten years ago.\u201d\n\nHe talked about the push for a balanced budget amendment and education reforms that focused on graduating students into skilled jobs and repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cSo what is Obamacare? It\u2019s increased prices, reduced choice in quality and it discourages businesses from hiring people. Other than that, it sounds like a good idea,\u201d Rubio quipped.\n\nThe Florida senator did not mention any of the 16 other Republican hopefuls by name, alluding to Donald Trump at one point. \u201cThere is someone running for president who likes to say he's going to make America great and I understand what he's trying to say. America is great that's not the issue.\"\n\nHe did take at least one jab though at the Democratic front-runner.\n\n\"Hillary Clinton recently came out with her college affordability plan, which almost was not released by the way because it was stored in her server which had been wiped,\" Rubio joked.\n\nRubio tied for third with Ted Cruz in Ohio in a Quinnipiac University poll released Thursday with 7seven percent of the vote. Governor John Kasich led the poll with 27 percent followed by Donald Trump with 21 percent.\n\nOhio\u2019s primary is March 15, 2016, and it is a winner-take-all primary.\n\n---\n\nFollow John Kosich on Facebook and Twitter\n\nFollow @KosichJohn\n\nDownload the newsnet5 app:", "article_metadata": {"isStory": "true", "isPremium": "false", "description": "To an overflow crowd of around 200 Sen.
