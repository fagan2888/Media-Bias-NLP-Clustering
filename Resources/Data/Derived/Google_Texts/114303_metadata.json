Running back Jarkeice Davis converted a fourth and short to get into the redzone. Two plays later, he punched in a five yard score for the games first points.\n\nDespite the missed point after, the home team stayed aggressive, as Jak Riley picked D'Vonta O'Neal on the next play from scrimmage.\n\nThe next play after that, the game was broken open. Sharks QB Troy Williams threw a 31 yard flea-flicker to Davis right before the half that gave full control of the game to Port St. Joe as they led 12-0, with the two-point conversion failing.\n\nIn the second half, the home team refused to let up, scoring 23 more unanswered as the Jackets could not find a way to get on the scoreboard.\n\nThe Sharks are off to Orlando to play for the 1A title in the Citrus Bowl, where they will go up against 1A-5 district champ Hamilton County, who beat Dixie County Friday 18-12.\n\nThe championship game will be played Friday, December 5th, with kickoff coming at 6:07 Central.", "article_metadata": {"medium": "video", "description": "Port St. Joe, FL---In Port St. Joe head coach John Palmer's first stint with the Sharks, he won the school their third and most recent state championship back in 2005.", "language": "english", "author": "Greg Brzozowski", "og": {"description": "Port St. Joe, FL---In Port St. Joe head coach John Palmer's first stint with the Sharks, he won the school their third and most recent state championship back in 2005.", "title": "Sharks Bound for State After Shutting Out Vernon", "url": "http://www.wjhg.com/sports/headlines/Sharks-Bound-for-State-After-Shutting-Out-Vernon-284199361.html", "image": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/7D9/259/7D92593380C84D4D912AF7377C2D2747", "video": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/59A/267/59A267001E2D42928F1CCA3EA50EBA20.mp4", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.wjhg.com", "description": "Port St. Joe, FL---In Port St. Joe head coach John Palmer's first stint with the Sharks, he won the school their third and most recent state championship back in 2005.", "title": "Sharks Bound for State After Shutting Out Vernon", "url": "http://www.wjhg.com/sports/headlines/Sharks-Bound-for-State-After-Shutting-Out-Vernon-284199361.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/7football6.jpg", "creator": "@WJHG_TV", "site": "@WJHG_TV", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "video_type": "video/mp4", "video_height": 288, "keywords": "Sharks Bound for State After Shutting Out Vernon", "google-site-verification": "orfdzs_E4bRXom1qluA34zerrmjsg4QfrlLSkrR3ZAQ", "video_width": 512, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Sharks Bound for State After"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2fc6\"", "article_summary": "Port St. Joe, FL---In Port St. Joe head coach John Palmer's first stint with the Sharks, he won the school their third and most recent state championship back in 2005.\nIn the second half, the home team refused to let up, scoring 23 more unanswered as the Jackets could not find a way to get on the scoreboard.\nPlaying at home for the first time in the this year's FHSAA 1A State Football Championships, Port St. Joe shut out visiting Vernon, ended the Yellow Jackets 11 game winning streak, and their season with a shutout 35-0.\nIn his first year back in his second tenure with the purple and yellow, he now will get a shot to add a fourth.\nSharks QB Troy Williams threw a 31 yard flea-flicker to Davis right before the half that gave full control of the game to Port St. Joe as they led 12-0, with the two-point conversion failing."}
