Washington (CNN) - Democratic National Committee Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz says her party will gain seats in the House of Representatives in this year's midterm elections.

But the congresswoman from Florida wouldn't go as far as others in her party have in predicting that the Democrats will win back control of the House come November.

Asked Monday by CNN anchor Kate Bolduan on "New Day" about the Democrats' chances to retake the chamber, the DNC chairwoman said, "I think we have tremendous opportunities across the country. I think we're going to pick up seats."

Democrats need to pick up 17 seats from the Republicans to regain the majority in the House, and with the shrinking number of competitive congressional districts most political handicappers say its unlikely the Democrats will recapture the chamber. And political observers see the recent retirement announcements of a handful of longtime Democratic representatives who would become chairs of powerful committees if their party retook the majority as a sign of the unlikely prospects of such a Democratic victory.

But earlier this month the second-ranking House Democrat predicted his party was in good position to take back the House.

House Democratic Whip Steny Hoyer pointed to a fundraising advantage for Democrats, lower poll numbers for congressional Republicans, divisions inside the GOP ranks, and a good recruiting class of Democratic challengers.

"All of those combined in my view give me great optimism that we're going to win back the House."
