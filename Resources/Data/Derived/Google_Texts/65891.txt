TORONTO â€“ Ontario's provincial parliament on Tuesday passed a law for eateries, convenience stores and movie theaters to label the amount of food and drink calories in menus and signs. Business chains with 20 or more retail outlets will need to comply with the Canadian province's Healthy Menu Choices Act beginning January 1, 2017.

Penalties for non-compliance to Ontario's Act are set at C$5,000 (US$4,004) for each day and up to C$10,000 (US$8,008) a day for subsequent offenses. Law firm Osler, Hoskin & Harcourt cautions franchisors of potential joint liability. "A franchisor's exposure to liability for compliance with the Act will likely be tied to the level of control (if any) it has over the activities carried on at the regulated food service premise," the Toronto-based legal firm advised clients in an email on Wednesday.

After lobbying against the law, Restaurants Canada, a trade association that represents the nation's foodservice industry, feels the final law is more palatable because it allows menus to be adopted by January 1, 2017, over 18 months from now. Association members were originally worried that the law would kick in this year. They are grateful for a watered down menu law. "Proposals to add sodium counts were defeated, which means the new rules will only apply to calories," declared the association on its website.

Government inspectors are to check for compliance among fast-food operators and convenience stores. As provincial bureaucrats ponder the minutia of the new regulations, Osler, Hoskin & Harcourt thinks that Ontario will likely follow the lead of the United States. America's newly enacted menu labeling requirements was part of ObamaCare, the 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. After consulting with the industry, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued the vetted specifics of its federal calorie labeling requirements in November, 2014.
