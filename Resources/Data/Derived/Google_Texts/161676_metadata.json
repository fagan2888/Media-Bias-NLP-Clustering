Stiefel Center for Trade Policy Studies at the Cato Institute, \u201cbecause the economic argument is falling on deaf ears in the Congress and in the more traditionally resistant arms of the Democratic Party.\u201d\n\nPerhaps the most resistant is organized labor, which has long fought the TPP and similar trade agreements that have come before, such as the North American Free Trade Agreement, which was passed during the Clinton administration to open trade with Mexico and Canada.\n\n\u201cWhen these kinds of agreements fail to make their case on economic grounds,\u201d said Thea Mei Lee, a deputy chief of staff at the AFL-CIO, the largest federation of unions in the U.S., \u201cthe leadership tends to invoke these sorts of amorphous national security issues.\u201d\n\nLabor isn\u2019t the only point of friction for the TPP, which is in its final stages of negotiation internationally but still has to make it through Congress once the trading partners have settled on the terms. The American dairy industry, which is being pressured to accept more dairy imports from abroad, is trying to offset this breach into their market share by exporting their own product to other countries.\n\n\u201cIf Canada opens its dairy market to some extent and if the U.S. gets a good package from Japan, then the U.S. could lower its barriers to New Zealand,\u201d said Michael Smart, vice president of Rock Creek Global Advisors, a consulting firm that works on trade.\n\nNegotiators have many such wrinkles to iron out in the coming weeks, and the Obama administration will likely have to account for many more when the TPP comes before Congress, which is likely to happen in September or October.\n\nBut some participants foresee a longer timeline for the agreement.\n\nModerating a panel before Kerry delivered his address, Frederick Kempe, the president and chief executive of the Atlantic Council, set the tone for the discussion by telling an anecdote.\n\n\u201cI asked a someone who worked on NAFTA what it takes to get one of these things done,\u201d he said. \u201cThe reply was, \u2018You have no idea what you\u2019re getting into.\u2019\u201d\n\nMore from MarketWatch", "article_metadata": {"lifp_basePath": "https://id.marketwatch.com/access", "twitter": {"domain": "marketwatch.com", "description": "Secretary of State John Kerry placed the issue of U.S. trade agreements firmly in a national security context Thursday, saying two pending trade deals with Asia-Pacific countries demonstrate how U.S. economic and national security interests are one and the same.", "image": {"width": 569, "identifier": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-BU757_Kerry__MG_20140216105512.jpg", "height": 398}, "card": "summary_large_image", "site": {"id": 624413}}, "parsely-author": "Tobias Burns of Medill News Service", "article.content_group": "marketwatch", "article.section": "Economy & Politics", "parsely-type": "post", "description": "Secretary of State John Kerry placed the issue of U.S. trade agreements firmly in a national security context Thursday, saying two pending trade deals with Asia-Pacific countries demonstrate how U.S. economic and national security interests are one and the same.", "parsely-link": "http://www.marketwatch.com/story/kerry-makes-national-security-pitch-for-trade-deals-2015-04-23", "author": "Tobias Burns of Medill News Service", "parsely-title": "Kerry makes national-security pitch for trade deals", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=336693422", "parsely-pub-date": "2015-04-23T15:04:00-04:00", "page.site": "marketwatch", "robots": "noarchive,noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 283204329838}, "parsely-section": "MW_Economy & Politics", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/marketwatch"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "og": {"site_name": "MarketWatch", "description": "Secretary of State John Kerry placed the issue of U.S. trade agreements firmly in a national security context Thursday, saying two pending trade deals with Asia-Pacific countries demonstrate how U.S. economic and national security interests are one and the same.", "title": "Kerry makes national-security pitch for trade deals", "url": "http://www.marketwatch.com/story/kerry-makes-national-security-pitch-for-trade-deals-2015-04-23", "image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-BU757_Kerry__MG_20140216105512.jpg", "type": "article"}, "ob": {"image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-BU757_Kerry__MG_20140216105512.jpg"}, "article.id": "C1075468-E9E6-11E4-A1B3-A57371081525", "position": 1}, "article_summary": "WASHINGTON (MarketWatch) \u2014 Secretary of State John Kerry placed the issue of U.S. trade agreements firmly in a national security context Thursday, saying two pending trade deals demonstrate how U.S. economic and national security interests are one and the same.\nReuters U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry says the economy and national security are integrated.\n\u201cI asked a someone who worked on NAFTA what it takes to get one of these things done,\u201d he said.\n\u201cIn our era, the economic and security realms are absolutely integrated,\u201d he told a room full of analysts and policymakers at an Atlantic Council event, making the case for the Trans-Pacific Partnership and Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, two sweeping trade deals being negotiated by the U.S. Trade Representative.\nBut many economists and Washington insiders see the move to couch these economic issues in a national security context as a way to make them more palatable to the mounting domestic forces that oppose them."}
