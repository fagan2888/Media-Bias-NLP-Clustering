Despite the fact that Hong Kong, China has a police force of 28,000 officers, they are struggling to contain the youth-led movement that has raged on for three weeks following demands of full democracy.

The most recent battle broke out early Sunday morning when demonstrators wearing goggles and helmets surged forward trying to tear down metal barricades. Police officers wearing riot shields started hitting the demonstrators with their batons and spraying them with pepper spray. After a violent scuffle, police officers were able to push the unarmed protesters back.
