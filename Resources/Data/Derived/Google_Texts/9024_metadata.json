The justices issued 13 opinions, most notably a 4-4 tie in the biggest labor case to reach the Supreme Court in years. They also heard oral arguments in several high-profile cases, including those involving the Affordable Care Act and abortion restrictions.\n\nThe Court\u2019s Key Decisions\n\nThe Court\u2019s equally divided decision in Friedrichs v. California Teachers Assn. highlighted that the justices may not reach a majority in some of the Term\u2019s most important cases. By virtue of the 4-4 tie, the lower court decision stands, without creating any new precedent. California\u2019s agency-shop system and opt-out requirements remain in tact and the issue of whether such agency fees violate the First Amendment will be decided another day.\n\nThe Court issued a number of other key decisions. Of interest to the business community, the Court held in Gobeille v. Liberty Mutual Insurance Co. that the Employment Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) pre-empts a Vermont state law requiring certain entities to provide claims payment data to the State. In Tyson Foods, Inc. v. Bouaphakeo, the justices ruled that held that plaintiffs may use of representative statistical evidence to support class certification.\n\nFinally, in V.L. v. E.L, the Court unanimously held that the State of Alabama must recognize an adoption by a same-sex parent that occurred in another state. The Court\u2019s per curium decision rested on the Constitution\u2019s Full Faith and Credit Clause.\n\nOral Arguments in March\n\nThe Court heard oral arguments in the latest legal challenge the Affordable Care Act\u2019s (ACA\u2019s) contraception mandate. Zubik v. Burwell centers on whether the ACA\u2019s current accommodation for religious nonprofit organizations that object to providing contraception coverage violates the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993 (RFRA).\n\nUnder current HHS regulations, religiously affiliated nonprofit corporations that object to birth control coverage can notify their insurance company, third-party benefits administrator, or the HHS about their objection. The plaintiffs argue that the notification process essentially acts as a \u201ctrigger\u201d and requires them \u201cto provide the morally objectionable coverage and allow their health plans to be used as a vehicle to bring about a morally objectionable wrong.\u201d\n\nDuring oral arguments, several justices appeared concerned the federal government was \u201chijacking\u201d the nonprofits\u2019 insurance coverage by providing birth control services they find objectionable. One week later, the Court asked both sides to provide briefs on several new issues that suggest the Court is striving to reach a compromise. The new issues include: \u201cwhether and how contraceptive coverage may be obtained by petitioners\u2019 employees through petitioners\u2019 insurance companies, but in a way that does not require any involvement of petitioners beyond their own decision to provide health insurance without contraceptive coverage to their employees\u201d; and \u201cwhether contraceptive coverage could be provided to petitioners\u2019 employees, through petitioners\u2019 insurance companies, without any such notice from petitioners.\u201d The Court\u2019s goal seems to be to remove non-profits from the process of providing birth control and other objectionable care, while also ensuring that employees can receive contraception services.\n\nBlockbuster on April Docket\n\nThe most significant case before the Court in April is United States v. Texas. The potential landmark case poses several legal challenges the Obama Administration\u2019s immigration policy seeking to establish a process for considering deferred action for certain illegal aliens. The most significant question before the Court is whether the executive action violates the Take Care Clause of the Constitution. Challengers argue that the President violated Article II, section 3 by failing to faithfully execute existing immigration laws. Oral arguments are scheduled for April 18, with a decision expected in June.\n\nDonald Scarinci is a managing partner at Lyndhurst, N.J. based law firm Scarinci Hollenbeck.
