It is uncontroverted that liberal elites have dominated law schools and the legal profession as a whole for decades.\n\nWe are reaping what they have sown, and it is not good.\n\nWhen the Constitution is seen not as a document to be respected and followed but as a \u201cliving, breathing\u201d document to be molded and manipulated to fit the latest cultural craze and personal policy, the door is opened for the kinds of abuses that are making a mess, not just of the confirmation process, but of the entire judicial system.\n\nEven when our justice system works the best way it can, within the parameters we have allowed, the results are damaging to our country overall.\n\nConsider two of last week\u2019s headlines. First, the Susan B. Anthony List (SBA) has finally ended their five-year battle to protect their free speech. SBA tried to erect billboards to expose Rep. Steve Driehous\u2019 (D-Ohio) support for taxpayer-funded abortion through his support of Obamacare but was prevented from doing so when Driehous complained under an Ohio \u201cfalse statement\u201d law. The law has now been found to be unconstitutional.\n\nBut SBA had to go all the way to the Supreme Court (where they won in 2014) and back to the Sixth Circuit to get this judgement five years later, after thousands \u2014 if not millions \u2014 of dollars invested in their defense.\n\nThe case is a great victory protecting free speech, no doubt. Yet, I hope we can all see that the process itself is incredibly chilling to the freedom of speech. The case should have been thrown out as soon as it was filed.\n\nThe second headline was that the bogus charges against former Texas Gov. Rick Perry were finally dropped. Who didn\u2019t see that coming?\n\nBut again, the damage these charges did to the political aspirations of Gov. Perry should not be overlooked. Gov. Perry said at a press conference, \u201cThe court\u2019s decision today proves that this indictment was nothing less than a baseless political attack, and an assault on constitutional powers.\u201d\n\nPerry admitted that the indictment \u201chad a negative effect\u201d on his presidential aspirations.\n\nWell, of course, it did.\n\nHere\u2019s one more example for you (just because it gives me an excuse to show this video clip of Dinesh D\u2019Souza\u2019s recent debate with Bill Ayers at the University of Michigan to those of you who haven\u2019t seen it). The question they are asked in the clip is, \u201cGiven your own personal experiences, do either of you feel our criminal justice system has become too political?\u201d\n\nBill Ayers predictably goes on to rail against the police, but D\u2019Souza humorously points out the irony of it all. Watch:\n\n\u201cThe inequity of our justice system is on display right on this podium right here.\u201d D\u2019Souza said. \u201cSo I gave $20,000 of my own money, over the campaign finance limit, I got eight months in overnight confinement \u2026 You bomb the Pentagon and tried to bomb all kinds of other things \u2026 How much time did you do in the slammer?\u201d\n\nOur judicial system is decrepit and everything trickles down for that hideous liberal ideology that encourages, not respect for the law, but the manipulation of the law and the Constitution to help advance a liberal worldview for \u201cthe greater good.\u201d\n\nAs always, the ends justify the means. And \u201cthe means\u201d in this area is the destruction of the U.S. Constitution and, with it, our form of government.\n\nIf we want to bring justice and stability back to our judicial system, we must start at the top by putting to death that repugnant \u201cliving\u201d constitution. We must heed Justice Scalia\u2019s advice and return judges to their proper role of interpreting law, rather than writing it.\n\nWe must return to that great vision of Alexander Hamilton who argued in Federalist 78 that \u201cthe judiciary is beyond comparison the weakest of the three departments of power.\u201d He must be turning in his grave.\n\n\u2013\n\nTheBlaze contributor channel supports an open discourse on a range of views.
