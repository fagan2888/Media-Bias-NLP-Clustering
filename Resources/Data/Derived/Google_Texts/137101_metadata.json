Patrick McHenry and Democratic challenger Tate MacQueen sharply disagreed on a range of issues during an Oct. 27 debate at UNC Asheville.\n\nThe two candidates are vying for a seat in the U.S. Congress representing District 10, which was redrawn in 2011 to include most of Asheville. The area stretches southeast to the Charlotte suburbs.\n\nAs the Republican majority\u2019s Chief Deputy Whip and member of the House Financial Services Committee, McHenry is one of the most powerful members of Congress. The Denver, N.C., resident said this year\u2019s election \u201cis about economic policy and continuing to grow jobs.\u201d He repeatedly blamed Democratic President Barack Obama and his policies for a Western North Carolina economy that \u201cis still struggling.\u201d\n\nOn the other hand, MacQueen cast McHenry and GOP policies as to blame, noting that polls show high disapproval ratings for Congress.\n\nA social studies and soccer coach at Charles D. Owen High School, MacQueen is best known as an outspoken neighborhood leader in the push to clean up pollution from the CTS Corporation\u2019s former plant in Arden. He alleged that McHenry \u201cturned his back\u201d on those suffering from contaminants in the area \u201cat our greatest time of need\u201d and said the issue was the main reason he entered the race.\n\nGiven the opportunity to ask his opponent a question, MacQueen looked his opponent in the eye and said, \u201cHave you no sense of compassion sir?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe answer is \u2018Yes, I do,\u201d McHenry replied.\n\nMacQueen also criticized McHenry for supporting hydraulic fracturing, often called \u201cfracking\u201d \u2014 a controversial method of mining for natural gas. MacQueen said the practice can result in groundwater contamination, much like what happened to his neighbors near the CTS site.\n\n\u201cThere is zero proof that fracking has polluted any groundwater in America,\u201d McHenry replied.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not a scientist,\u201d MacQueen retorted, claiming that \u201ca tsunami of scientists\u201d have said fracking \u201charms our water supply.\u201d\n\nMcHenry said he favors allowing the mining as part of an aggressive policy to \u201creward the production of American energy.\u201d\n\nMacQueen countered that, unlike his opponent, he \u201cdidn\u2019t take any money from Halliburton, big banks, big oil.\u201d MacQueen said he wants the equivalent of \u201can Apollo Mission\u201d to make America \u201cenergy efficient.\u201d\n\nThe biggest impediment to growing jobs in the region is \u201cObamacare\u201d (also known as the Affordable Care Act), said McHenry. Costs from the health care law are impeding small businesses from hiring employees, he said.\n\nMacQueen said he favors a single-payer health care system, but thinks the Affordable Care Act is a step in the right direction because more people are now insured. He said McHenry is using \u201cfear tactics\u201d in his characterization of the law: \u201cYou guys aught to be calling it \u201c\u2019Obama-scare,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cI believe health care is a right, not a privilege.\u201d\n\nTo grow the economy, McHenry said he also wants \u201cfundamental tax reform\u201d that includes lowering the corporate income tax rate to help lure international companies to the U.S. and prevent them from leaving.\n\nMacQueen said he thinks the tax system already favors corporations and wealthy individuals at the expense of the working class. \u201cWorking class people need the tax breaks,\u201d he said.\n\nTo stimulate the economy, MacQueen said he wants to end \u201cfree trade tax incentives\u201d that encourage companies to go overseas. He also wants to invest in transportation infrastructure and \u201craise the minimum wage to a living wage.\u201d\n\nAsked their views on illegal immigration, McHenry said he thinks \u201cborder security should be first and foremost, period.\u201d He added: \u201cThe idea [of] simply legalizing a number of people who have come here illegally is not the right approach.\u201d\n\nMacQueen said he wants \u201ca compassionate approach\u201d that includes \u201ca pathway to citizenship.\u201d Saying that he\u2019s had students who \u201chave been shipped here,\u201d he added: \u201cChildren who came here through no fault of their own should not be vilified and treated as the enemy.\u201d\n\nOn another controversial international topic, McHenry said he favors banning travel to the U.S. from African areas dealing with Ebola outbreaks. MacQueen disagreed, saying such a blanket travel ban could hurt international trade.\n\nAnd asked their thoughts on how to deal with the ISIS terrorist group in the Middle East, the two candidates also diverged.\n\nMcHenry said he wants \u201cboots on the ground\u201d to combat the forces. The destabilization of Iraq and emergence of ISIS is due largely because Obama pulled the majority of U.S. troops out of the area, McHenry said.\n\nMacQueen said he doesn\u2019t want U.S. troops engaged in \u201canother quagmire\u201d in the Middle East and said he thinks neighboring countries such as Turkey and Saudi Arabia \u201chave the people and the funds\u201d to do the fighting \u201cwhile we play the support role.\u201d\n\nAs for dealing with violence closer to home, McHenry emphasized a need to focus on mental illness and protect the Second Amendment right to bear arms. He noted that he is a lifelong member of the National Rifle Association.\n\nMacQueen said he also likes to shoot recreationally, but thinks more regulations are needed to prevent gun violence. He wants to require that consumers undergo background checks at gun shows.\n\nThe candidates were also asked about the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) and recent court rulings to legalize same-sex marriage in North Carolina.\n\nMcHenry noted that he supported gay marriage bans such as DOMA and Amendment One. As far as the recent court rulings, he said, \u201cI don\u2019t agree with judges legislating from the bench.\u201d Now that gay marriage is legal in North Carolina, he said his focus will be on \u201cmaking sure religious organizations and individuals aren\u2019t forced to do things against their faith.\u201d\n\nMacQueen said he supports the rulings allowing gay marriage: \u201cIt\u2019s about equality, nothing more, nothing less.\u201d\n\nOrganized by the Council of Independent Business Owners, the event marked the candidates\u2019 first and only Asheville debate.\n\nThe 10th district leans conservative, and in 2012, McHenry beat Democratic candidate Patsy Keever by 57 percent overall despite earning less votes than her in Buncombe County.\n\nUPDATE: Watch a video of the debate embedded here via Jerry Rice\u2019s YouTube page.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Republican Rep.
