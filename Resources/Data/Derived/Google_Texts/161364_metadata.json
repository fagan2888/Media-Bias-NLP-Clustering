The show won\u2019t be tape-delayed here to synch with primetime and higher ad rates as in the past.\n\nThe 58th Annual Grammy Awards, hosted by two-time Grammy winner LL COOL J, will be broadcast live Monday, Feb. 15, even here in the Mountain time zone, from 6-9:30 p.m. The red carpet hoopla can be seen starting at 5 p.m. MT.\n\nThat means for once the Twitter comments from the East Coast won\u2019t ruin the surprises locally. We won\u2019t have to studiously avoid commentary while awaiting the old-fashioned delayed broadcast.\n\nThe 2015 Grammy telecast scored an average 24.8 million viewers.\n\nPerformers this year include Adele; Alabama Shakes; Joey Alexander; Justin Bieber; Jackson Browne; Luke Bryan; Gary Clark, Jr.; Andra Day; Diplo; Don Henley, Bernie Leadon, Timothy B.
