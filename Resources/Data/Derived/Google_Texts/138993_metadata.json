Temperatures were in the 30s, which is unusual for the El Paso area.\n\nIn an era of shrinking financial resources, policymakers, providers, and activists who work on homelessness prevention and care in the United States have been forced to develop new strategies. There was a time when officials at the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) saw it as their responsibility to provide both housing and supportive services for homeless individuals, but now HUD now is refocusing its budget predominately on rent and housing\u2014with the hope that other local, state, and federal agencies will play a greater role in providing supportive care. However, whether other organizations will actually be able to pick up those costs and responsibilities remains unclear.\n\nThe first major federal legislative response to homelessness was the McKinney-Vento Act of 1987, which passed both the House and Senate with large bipartisan majorities. The McKinney Act\u2014which Bill Clinton later renamed the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act\u2014provided funds not only for emergency shelter, transitional housing, and permanent housing, but also for job training, primary health care, mental health care, drug and alcohol treatment, education programs, and other supportive services. The consensus was that homelessness is a complex problem whose solution requires more than simply a roof and a bed.\n\nThe statutory goal of the McKinney Act was to gradually move homeless people toward stable housing and independence\u2014a model that came to be known as \u201cHousing Readiness.\u201d Though this sprung from well-meaning intentions, it eventually became clear that this \u201cgradual\u201d approach frequently led to unwise and unfair ways of distributing welfare.\n\n\u201cWe had this system that said homeless people essentially have to earn their way to permanent housing,\u201d explained Ed Stellon, the senior director of the Midwest Harm Reduction Institute, and someone who has worked within the substance use and mental health treatment systems for more than 20 years. \u201cHomeless people had to earn their way into transitional housing, make progress on certain goals, and finally when they were deemed well enough, they would earn their spot in permanent housing.\u201d\n\nA different model, known as \u201cHousing First\u201d, has been gaining steam over the past decade. What at first sounded revolutionary now feels fairly obvious: The Housing First approach posits that the only requirement for housing should be homelessness\u2014that shelter is a right, not a privilege. \u201cPlus, if you have conditions like out-of-control diabetes, congestive heart failure, or schizophrenia, housing is actually part of the solution,\u201d adds Stellon. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to make any meaningful progress on these chronic conditions without stable housing.\u201d\n\nThough exact estimates are hard to come by, HUD recently reported that as of January 2014, the chronically homeless numbered some 84,291, with 63 percent of those individuals living on the streets. HUD says this number has declined by 21 percent, or 22,937 persons, since 2010\u2014in large part because of the embrace of Housing First. (Some, however, have accused the federal government of using data gimmicks to paint a more cheery picture of progress than has actually been made.)\n\nNevertheless, the reality is that at the same time policymakers are embracing the idea of Housing First, fewer affordable housing units exist than ever before. According to the National Low Income Housing Coalition, federal support for low-income housing has fallen 49 percent between 1980 and 2003, and the Joint Center for Housing Studies found about 200,000 rental units are destroyed annually. Research also suggests that a supply of 8.2 million more units would be needed to house extremely low-income households, up from a gap of 5.2 million a decade earlier. Though Congress recently authorized funding for the National Housing Trust Fund\u2014an entity that was created in 2008 to fund affordable housing projects\u2014its budget is nowhere near large enough to meet the demand.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not doing enough to expand housing availability, and HUD can't expand its services unless Congress allocates it more funding,\u201d says Barbara DiPietro, the director of policy for the National Health Care for the Homeless Council.\n\nGiven the fiscal climate, HUD is looking for new ways to spend its increasingly limited budget. Consequently, the agency is moving away from the supportive services that, through the McKinney-Vento Act, once accounted for most of its spending. In 1998, for instance, 55 percent of HUD\u2019s budget was spent on supportive services, and 45 percent was awarded for housing. By 2013, just 26 percent of HUD\u2019s competitive homeless assistance funds went to supportive services, and 66 percent was spent on housing. According to Ann Oliva, director of HUD\u2019s Office of Special Needs Assistance Programs, the department\u2019s goal now is to help local communities become more strategic with existing resources and available opportunities.\n\nTo do this, HUD has been working closely with other federal agencies, especially the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), and the U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness. In 2008, a joint program known as HUD-Veterans Affairs Supportive Housing (HUD-VASH) launched, combining housing vouchers for homeless veterans provided by HUD, with case management and clinical services provided by the V.A. Experts agree that HUD-VASH has been quite successful in helping both vets and their families, and it\u2019s typically held up as the poster child for future interagency collaborative efforts. However, the program came with additional appropriated dollars, and it is typically easier to convince Congress to fund programs for impoverished military veterans compared to other downtrodden groups.\n\nOne of the most significant recent changes to homelessness policy has come through the expansion of Medicaid\u2014a key feature of the Affordable Care Act. Now that nearly all individuals with incomes up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level are eligible for health insurance in states that opt for the expansion, agencies are scrambling to enroll thousands of homeless people so that they may benefit from new streams of mandatory government spending.\n\nBut Medicaid is, at its heart, a program controlled by the states. And with some states still vigorously opposed to expanding Medicaid\u2014despite the ACA\u2019s mandate for the federal government to pick up nearly all of the tab for the expansion\u2014let alone some of the flexible legislative adaptations that HHS is encouraging, consistent and widespread changes to supportive services seem unlikely in the near future.\n\nThough Medicaid expansion presents great opportunities for providing services to the homeless, some are concerned that the more flexible federal dollars currently set aside to work with homeless people will eventually just be funneled into the larger health insurance pool, with little, if any, allocated to doing what it takes to bring those with no homes into the government support system, which is needed in order to provide preventive care.\n\n\u201cGoing out four or five times to visit with a woman living alone under a bridge, just trying to form a relationship and build trust with her so she will feel comfortable coming in to get more help\u2014those types of health encounters are not typically billable through health insurance,\u201d adds Stellon, who says outreach can be one of the hardest things for him to fund. \u201cIn our current system, it\u2019s easier to pay for someone\u2019s amputated fingers than to build a human relationship.\u201d\n\nUltimately, there is only so much the government can do to advance the goal of Housing First with a depleting stock of housing units and a shrinking budget for supportive services.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a big mistake to come up with a good solution like Housing First and then to hamstring it because we don\u2019t actually have the money for it,\u201d says Todd Stull, the clinical director at a JOURNEYS | The Road Home, an organization that provides services and shelter to families and individuals in Illinois\u2019s North and Northwest suburban Cook County. \u201cOne of the worst things you can do is get someone into housing for a short period of time and then they lose it. Then they lose trust in the providers.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have not done well as a nation taking on poverty and implementing policies needed to address homelessness,\u201d says Dr. Sam Tsemberis, the founder and CEO of Pathways to Housing, a national organization that first pioneered the Housing First model in 1992. \u201cSo we end up taking care of homelessness out of desperation, but we'll be taking care of homelessness forever if we don't take care of poverty.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe need more money,\u201d adds DiPietro. \u201cUntil then, we\u2019re just rearranging the priority list.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The American Prospect", "description": "The new approach may spring from good intentions, but is undermined by a lack of affordable housing stock.", "title": "'Housing First' Policy for Addressing Homelessness Hamstrung By Funding Issues", "url": "http://prospect.org/article/housing-first-policy-addressing-homelessness-hamstrung-funding-issues", "image": "http://prospect.org/sites/default/files/styles/thumbnail/public/ap272559774565.jpg?itok=6aUX7aDv", "type": "article"}, "google-site-verification": "4dItj6FrXn-I63uD7pcvQKf3n3Qc6AIxiwwzo0_G4zk", "fb": {"admins": 431364, "app_id": 107113422697949}, "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "viewport": "initial-scale = 1.0, width = device-width"}, "article_summary": "Consequently, the agency is moving away from the supportive services that, through the McKinney-Vento Act, once accounted for most of its spending.\nIn 1998, for instance, 55 percent of HUD\u2019s budget was spent on supportive services, and 45 percent was awarded for housing.\nBy 2013, just 26 percent of HUD\u2019s competitive homeless assistance funds went to supportive services, and 66 percent was spent on housing.\n\u201cSo we end up taking care of homelessness out of desperation, but we'll be taking care of homelessness forever if we don't take care of poverty.\u201d\u201cWe need more money,\u201d adds DiPietro.\nThe consensus was that homelessness is a complex problem whose solution requires more than simply a roof and a bed."}
