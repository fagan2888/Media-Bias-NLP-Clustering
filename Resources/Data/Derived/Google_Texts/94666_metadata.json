The consensus: Minnesota\u2019s teacher licensure process has become overcomplicated and messy, and prevents good teachers from reaching the classroom.\n\nOur board members told us this teacher shortage is affecting them in all areas of instruction \u2014 from art, to career and tech, to business classes, to foreign languages and to special education.\n\nThe recent \u201cMinnesota Teacher Licensure\u201d report from the Office of the Legislative Auditor also shed some light on this shortage. According to the auditor\u2019s report: \u201cSchool districts and charter schools have reported serious concerns about teacher shortages \u2026 80 percent of respondents said it was \u2018difficult\u2019 or \u2018very difficult\u2019 to fill vacant teaching positions for the 2015-16 school year.\u201d\n\nIn its summary, the auditor wrote: \u201cWhile there are many causes for the teacher shortage, legislators and others have identified teacher licensure as a contributing factor.\u201d\n\nThe auditor\u2019s report, several newspaper stories across the state, and legislative hearings this month have raised the awareness that our state\u2019s complex licensure system continues to make the process difficult for prospective new teachers.\n\nAnother study shows that 3,504 teachers (6 percent of our teaching force) are teaching without the proper license. Also, the number of new licenses awarded during the last five years has decreased by 7 percent.\n\nIn a letter to Minnesota Department of Education Commission Brenda Cassellius, the U.S. Department of Education\u2019s Office of Postsecondary Education designated 28 teacher shortage areas. One-third of those shortage areas is made up of licensed special education teachers \u2014 where there is a growing need. Other key shortage areas include science and math \u2014 areas we need to excel in to contribute to a strong Minnesota economy and compete nationally.\n\nHiring the most effective and dedicated teachers is one of the school districts\u2019 most important duties. A highly effective teacher is the No. 1 indicator of academic progress for students. Research shows students actually lose ground from under-performing teachers, sometimes needing two years or more to make up for lost learning. If we do not have an adequate pool of effective candidates, student performance will suffer.\n\nMSBA and its members are continuing to find solutions to this issue. Back in 2014, the MSBA Delegate Assembly (a body comprised of school board member delegates) passed a resolution urging the Legislature \u201cto provide school board members more flexibility in hiring and retaining high-quality teachers.\u201d\n\nIn MSBA\u2019s 2016 Legislative Priorities, we are calling on the Legislature to pass a comprehensive \u201cTeacher Shortage Act\u201d that would include short-term and long-term strategies to attract high school and college students into the teaching profession and increase the number of teacher candidates licensed in Minnesota. We\u2019d also like to see efforts made to help attract out-of-state licensed teachers to Minnesota.\n\nMSBA has identified several potential solutions that we will introduce in a bill during the 2016 session:\n\n1. Broaden the scope of licensure for \u201chard-to-fill\u201d areas such as science and special education \u2014 and provide flexibility in allowing licensed teachers to teach outside their license authority as long as they can pass the appropriate test or attain a certain level on their performance review.\n\n2. Implement \u201cGrow Your Own\u201d grant programs that would allow local school boards to identify the needs and opportunities in their communities that would promote a pathway for teachers and paraprofessionals into the public schools.\n\n3. Attract qualified teachers by expanding the MSBA-initiated loan forgiveness program or other incentives \u2014 especially for student teachers who commit to teaching in \u201chard-to-fill\u201d degrees such as computer science, chemistry and business.\n\n4. Implement a \u201cone-stop shop\u201d statewide job posting board to match teacher openings to teacher candidates which would help our school districts find or hire teachers from a more diverse pool of applicants.\n\nThe issues will not get fixed overnight. MSBA is taking a long-term approach to this matter. We view this has an opportunity to modernize our teacher workforce so our students can achieve at the highest level.\n\nWe can\u2019t ignore this issue. Our students are depending on us to step forward to get highly effective teachers in the classroom.\n\nThis is the opinion of Kirk Schneidawind, executive director of the Minnesota School Boards Association, a leading advocate for public education that supports, promotes and strengthens the work of public school boards.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://www.sctimes.com/story/opinion/2016/03/19/school-boards-group-targets-teacher-shortage/81928686/", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Auditor's report highlights licensure problem; association offers multifaceted solution", "og": {"site_name": "St. Cloud Times", "description": "Auditor's report highlights licensure problem; association offers multifaceted solution", "title": "School boards group targets teacher shortage", "url": "http://www.sctimes.com/story/opinion/2016/03/19/school-boards-group-targets-teacher-shortage/81928686/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/sctimes.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Auditor's report highlights licensure problem; association offers multifaceted solution", "title": "School boards group targets teacher shortage", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/16f70074208490b1b0d54c6be801b309fe4e568a/c=67-0-468-401&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/10/12/StCloud/StCloud/635802728075118941-Your-turn.jpg", "creator": "@sctimes", "site": "@sctimes", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=830659200", "fb": {"app_id": 170170889686818}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070"}, "article_summary": "Minnesota School Boards Association officials toured the state last fall and heard this concern firsthand from hundreds of school board members.\nThe recent \u201cMinnesota Teacher Licensure\u201d report from the Office of the Legislative Auditor also shed some light on this shortage.\nThis is the opinion of Kirk Schneidawind, executive director of the Minnesota School Boards Association, a leading advocate for public education that supports, promotes and strengthens the work of public school boards.\nOne-third of those shortage areas is made up of licensed special education teachers \u2014 where there is a growing need.\nYour Turn (Photo: Times graphic)Minnesota is experiencing a teacher shortage throughout the state as school districts see a sharp decline in applicants for open teaching positions."}
