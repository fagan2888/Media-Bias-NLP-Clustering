(AP) \u2014 Hey, don\u2019t forget about us.\n\nAs in, yes, while Brady-Manning 17 takes place earlier in the day, the teams with the two best records in the NFL go at it in the NFC championship game Sunday night.\n\nThat would be the host Carolina Panthers, that rare team to go 15-1 in the regular season, and the Arizona Cardinals, who were next in the NFC and overall standings at 13-3. Maybe it isn\u2019t the juiciest story line dominating the football world, but there\u2019s plenty of reasons to be intrigued by this one, too.\n\n\u201cOne guy (Tom Brady) is playing in his 10th and there are two guys that are playing in their first,\u201d Cardinals quarterback Carson Palmer says of reaching the last step before the Super Bowl. Palmer, in his 13th season, and Panthers QB Cam Newton, in his fifth, are newbies at conference title games. \u201cEverybody has a different journey. Everybody has a different path, and however it works out is the way it works out. Everybody has different roads.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s also true for the coaches. Arizona\u2019s Bruce Arians\u2019 long and winding coaching road goes back to his time at Alabama under Bear Bryant. Ron Rivera, a linebacker for the awesome Chicago Bears\u2019 defense of the 1980s, spent time on three coaching staffs before landing the Carolina gig.\n\nBoth franchises have been to the Super Bowl and lost close contests. New England beat Carolina 32-29 after the 2003 season, and Pittsburgh edged Arizona 27-23 for the 2009 championship.\n\n\u201cI think we are the better team,\u201d Panthers All-Pro cornerback Patrick Peterson says. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure they are saying the same thing, that they are the better team. We\u2019ll find out on Sunday.\u201d\n\nSome things to watch for in the NFC championship game, which kicks off at 6:40 p.m. ET:\n\n___\n\nHEISMANS: This is the first meeting of Heisman Trophy-winning quarterbacks in a conference championship. Palmer won it at Southern California in 2002 and Newton took it at Auburn eight years later.\n\nThis has been the best pro season for both of them. Newton, the All-Pro QB, threw for 35 touchdowns and ran for 10, an unprecedented number for the position. Palmer has the highest passer rating, 104.6, of any of the four remaining quarterbacks \u2014 yes, higher than Hall of Fame-bound Brady and Peyton Manning \u2014 and also threw for 35 scores.\n\nThe list of Heisman winners at the position who had NFL success has been slim. Consider these names surrounding Palmer\u2019s award: Chris Weinke, Eric Crouch, Jason White and Matt Leinart.\n\nBetter to look at the professional pedigree. When healthy, Palmer has been a solid quarterback if not spectacular, and he is a perfect fit for Arians\u2019 schemes in Arizona.\n\nNewton has taken the Panthers to three straight NFC South titles, something never previously achieved. His skill set can be overwhelming, as is his confidence.\n\nHe expects to perform at a high level regardless of the circumstances or pressure.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Plenty of reasons to be intrigued by NFC championship game", "title": "Plenty of reasons to be intrigued by NFC championship game", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Plenty of reasons to be intrigued by NFC championship game", "title": "Plenty of reasons to be intrigued by NFC championship game", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2016/01/23/plenty_of_reasons_to_be_intrigued_by_nfc_championship_game/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/01/nfc-championship-football.jpeg2-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Plenty of reasons to be intrigued by NFC championship game", "title": "Plenty of reasons to be intrigued by NFC championship game", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/01/nfc-championship-football.jpeg2-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Barry Wilner", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "We\u2019ll find out on Sunday.\u201dSome things to watch for in the NFC championship game, which kicks off at 6:40 p.m.\nAs in, yes, while Brady-Manning 17 takes place earlier in the day, the teams with the two best records in the NFL go at it in the NFC championship game Sunday night.\nMaybe it isn\u2019t the juiciest story line dominating the football world, but there\u2019s plenty of reasons to be intrigued by this one, too.\n\u201cI think we are the better team,\u201d Panthers All-Pro cornerback Patrick Peterson says.\nPalmer, in his 13th season, and Panthers QB Cam Newton, in his fifth, are newbies at conference title games."}
