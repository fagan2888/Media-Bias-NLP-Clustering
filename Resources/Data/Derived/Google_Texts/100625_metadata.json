That increase outpaces 3% growth in the number of young workers without kids who voluntarily work part time.\n\n\u201cBy allowing people to buy insurance through the exchanges and extending Medicaid coverage to millions of people, the ACA also largely ends workers\u2019 dependence on their employer for insurance. This gives tens of millions of people the option to change their job, to work part-time, or take time off to be with young children or family members in need of care, or to retire early,\u201d Jorgensen wrote.\n\nThe study examined whether key portions of Obamacare that kicked in this year and expanded health-insurance coverage impacted workers\u2019 choices about how many hours to put in at their job. Employees who no longer need to put in a full day to earn benefits may choose to cut hours.\n\nAmong those who voluntarily work part time (as opposed to those who are in a part-time job because they can\u2019t find a full-time spot), the greatest year-over-year employment growth was seen among workers between 16- and 35-years old. Voluntary part-time employment in this group during the first half of the year was up 5% from the year-earlier period, far outpacing other age groups, CEPR found.\n\nAmong these young workers, the greater the number of kids, the greater the growth in voluntary part-time employment. Those with one or two children saw voluntarily part-time employment growth of 10% in the first half of 2014 this year compared with the year-earlier period, while those with at least three kids saw growth of 15%.\n\n\u201cOverall the data are consistent with the view that many workers are now able to work at jobs that are more consistent with their family responsibilities as a result of the fact that they don\u2019t need to get health insurance through their jobs,\u201d Jorgensen wrote. \u201cIf these results hold up in coming years this will mean that workers are now able to more easily reconcile family obligations with work.\u201d\n\n\u2013Ruth Mantell\n\nFollow Ruth on Twitter @RuthMantell\n\nFollow the Capitol Report blog on Twitter @CapitolReport\n\nCheck out these Capitol Report links:\n\nDespite slowdown in hiring, jobs conditions index improves in August\n\nMortgage gauge hits 14-year low, but that doesn\u2019t mean housing is dead", "article_metadata": {"article.author": "MarketWatch", "description": "More young parents have been able to work part time this year thanks to the Affordable Care Act, which is cutting employees\u2019 reliance on their bosses to provide health benefits.", "application-name": "MarketWatch.com", "article.page": "Capitol Report Blog", "og": {"site_name": "Marketwatch", "description": "More young parents have been able to work part time this year thanks to the Affordable Care Act, which is cutting employees\u2019 reliance on their bosses to provide health benefits.", "title": "Obamacare is helping more young parents who want to work part time: study", "url": "http://blogs.marketwatch.com/capitolreport/2014/09/10/obamacare-is-helping-more-young-parents-work-part-time/", "image": {"width": 569, "identifier": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/MWimages/MW-CT858_CEPR09_MG_20140910141645.jpg", "height": 398}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Marketwatch.com", "description": "More young parents have been able to work part time this year thanks to the Affordable Care Act, which is cutting employees\u2019 reliance on their bosses to provide health benefits.", "title": "Obamacare is helping more young parents who want to work part time: study", "url": "http://blogs.marketwatch.com/capitolreport/2014/09/10/obamacare-is-helping-more-young-parents-work-part-time/", "image": {"src": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/MWimages/MW-CT858_CEPR09_MG_20140910141645.jpg"}, "site": "MarketWatch", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.published": "2014-09-10T15:48:42-04:00", "article.access": "free", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "msapplication-tooltip": "MarketWatch", "article.type": "Capitol Report", "article.id": "BL-MWEB-7184", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.marketwatch.com/capitolreport/2014/09/10/obamacare-is-helping-more-young-parents-work-part-time/", "app_id": 283204329838}, "article.created": "2014-09-10T15:48:42-04:00", "article.updated": "2014-09-10T16:04:12-04:00", "keywords": "ACA,Obamacare", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/marketwatch", "image_count": 2}, "article.section": "Blogs", "article.headline": "Obamacare is helping more young parents who want to work part time: study", "msapplication-task": "name=SmartMoney;action-uri=http://www.smartmoney.com/;icon-uri=http://www.smartmoney.com/favicon.ico", "news_keywords": "ACA,Obamacare"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb52c\"", "article_summary": "That increase outpaces 3% growth in the number of young workers without kids who voluntarily work part time.\nAmong these young workers, the greater the number of kids, the greater the growth in voluntary part-time employment.\nVoluntary part-time employment in this group during the first half of the year was up 5% from the year-earlier period, far outpacing other age groups, CEPR found.\nMore young parents have been able to work part time this year thanks to the Affordable Care Act, which is cutting employees\u2019 reliance on their bosses to provide health benefits, according to soon-to-be-released research.\nThis gives tens of millions of people the option to change their job, to work part-time, or take time off to be with young children or family members in need of care, or to retire early,\u201d Jorgensen wrote."}
