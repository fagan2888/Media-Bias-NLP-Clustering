Compared to last year, more consumers are signed up for coverage, more consumers actively renewed their plans and more consumers had a smooth experience at HealthCare.gov,\u201d said Lori Lodes, spokeswoman for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.\n\nWhile the administration insists the law is on solid footing, congressional Republicans have scheduled a vote Tuesday to try to override President Obama\u2019s veto and repeal major parts of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThough they don\u2019t have the numbers to override the veto, Republicans want to draw a contrast with Democrats as the presidential campaign swings from Iowa to New Hampshire and other primary election states.\n\n\u201cIt is also just one in a number of steps we\u2019re taking to hold President Obama accountable for the failures of this law,\u201d said the office of House Speaker Paul D. Ryan, Wisconsin Republican.\n\nCongress is taking action as voters begin the long process of selecting Mr. Obama\u2019s successor. Iowa\u2019s caucuses Monday night kicked off the Democratic and Republican nominating contests.\n\nA poll from the Kaiser Family Foundation said this year\u2019s voters are more interested in the economy and terrorism than health care, but that hasn\u2019t stopped the Republican-led Congress from highlighting Obamacare\u2019s challenges.\n\nHalf of Obamacare\u2019s co-op plans have failed, and some insurers say they are losing money by offering plans on the law\u2019s Web-based exchanges. Meanwhile, congressional scorekeepers severely downgraded their enrollment projections for the year.\n\nBut the administration says most insurers are sticking with the health care law and that those who signed up for plans this year are younger and healthier \u2014 just the kinds of customers the market needs to entice to make Obamacare\u2019s economics work.\n\n\u201cHaving people of good health participating in the marketplaces will contribute to the long-term financial stability of those marketplaces,\u201d White House press secretary Josh Earnest said. \u201cThat\u2019s why that was a focus of our efforts, and the early indications are that those efforts were successful.\u201d\n\nHe said people with health problems probably signed up during the first two years, but the rising penalty for lacking insurance is finally persuading younger, healthier Americans to sign up.\n\nThe \u201cindividual mandate\u201d tax for shirking insurance this year starts at about $700, more than double the baseline penalty for 2015.\n\nAlthough the deadline for signing up was Sunday, Ms. Lodes said, customers who were waiting for help from the federal call center were asked to leave their information so representatives could help them finish later.\n\n\u201cThis is the same \u2018in-line special enrollment period\u2019 we have used in the past,\u201d she said.\n\nSome of the 12 states and the District of Columbia that operate their own exchanges were more lenient.\n\nCovered California said customers who started the process by Sunday have through Saturday to finish. The District of Columbia and Maryland offered residents extra time to sign up because of a major snowstorm that smacked the capital region a week earlier.\n\nMarylanders who started the process have through Friday to pick a plan if they attest that weather prevented them from enrolling on time.\n\nD.C. applicants have until Tuesday to enroll, even if they haven\u2019t started the process.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The administration declared victory for Obamacare on Monday, saying the third year of sign-ups on the health care exchanges went smoothly and set an enrollment record, with customers younger and healthier than they have been in the past.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "The administration declared victory for Obamacare on Monday, saying the third year of sign-ups on the health care exchanges went smoothly and set an enrollment record, with customers younger and healthier than they have been in the past.", "title": "Obamacare enrollment sets record with younger, healthier customers", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/feb/1/obamacare-enrollment-sets-record-with-younger-heal/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2016/02/01/Health_Insurance.JPEG-02b64.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2016/02/01/Health_Insurance.JPEG-02b64.jpg", "description": "The administration declared victory for Obamacare on Monday, saying the third year of sign-ups on the health care exchanges went smoothly and set an enrollment record, with customers younger and healt", "card": "summary", "title": "Obamacare enrollment sets record with younger, healthier customers"}, "Author": "Tom Howell Jr.", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Politics"}, "article_summary": "The administration declared victory for Obamacare on Monday, saying the third year of sign-ups on the health care exchanges went smoothly and set an enrollment record, with customers younger and healthier than they have been in the past.\nCovered California said customers who started the process by Sunday have through Saturday to finish.\nWhile final numbers were still being tallied, the administration said enrollment avoided the kinds of problems that plagued the exchanges in 2013 and 2014.\nA poll from the Kaiser Family Foundation said this year\u2019s voters are more interested in the economy and terrorism than health care, but that hasn\u2019t stopped the Republican-led Congress from highlighting Obamacare\u2019s challenges.\nMarylanders who started the process have through Friday to pick a plan if they attest that weather prevented them from enrolling on time."}
