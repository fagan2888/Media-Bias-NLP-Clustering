During the registration period from Nov. 1 through Dec. 31, the exchange reported 169,563 enrollees \u2014 132,263 who bought private insurance, 35,269 eligible for Medicaid and 2,031 in the Child Health Plan Plus program. Of those, about 47,000 are new to the exchange, officials said. In 2014 the exchange signed up about 150,000.\n\nUnder the Affordable Care Act, obtaining health insurance avoids federal tax penalties, and enrolling through the state exchange qualifies the buyer for possible federal tax credits.\n\nBut while the state exchange welcomed newly insured residents, many people who enjoyed the cheapest insurance policies last year haven\u2019t returned.\n\nThose policies were offered by Colorado HealthOp, a co-operative shut down by the state Division of Insurance at the end of 2015 after its reserves were depleted by an unexpectedly small reimbursement from a federal program.\n\nThat cost about 82,000 people their health insurance, and 64,000 of them were insured through the state exchange, officials said.\n\nConnect for Health Colorado spokesman Luke Clarke said 25,000 former co-op members have found replacement policies through the exchange to date.\n\nHe said he could not pinpoint how many co-op members remain uninsured today because some could have bought policies outside the exchange.\n\nBut \u201cit looks like there is a significant population out there without coverage,\u201d he said.\n\nRichard Backe, a former co-op member who lives in Glenwood Springs, called a broker to help him find a new policy on the exchange.\n\n\u201cI loved the co-op,\u201d he said. \u201cThey covered everything they said they would. Their rates were $500 lower than what we\u2019re paying now.\u201d\n\nHe now pays $1,509 a month for a high-deductible policy for him and his wife, a 50 percent increase. And when he went to pick up prescription drugs the co-op had provided at no additional charge, he said, it cost him $160.\n\nLast fall, Connect for Health Colorado chief Kevin Patterson estimated that 75 percent of co-op members would find new policies through the exchange.\n\nClarke said that because co-op members lost insurance Dec. 31, they will have two more months to sign up for 2016 coverage.\n\n\u201cWe hope to get them all,\u201d he said.\n\nDavid Olinger: 303-954-1498, dolinger@denverpost.com or @dolingerdp", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Colorado health co-op\u2019s shutdown leaving many uninsured", "title": "Colorado health co-op\u2019s shutdown leaving many uninsured", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/01/06/colorado-health-co-ops-shutdown-leaving-many-uninsured/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "height": 630}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2016-01-06T17:08:37+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-01-06T17:08:37+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Overall, Connect for Health Colorado reported success in getting more people to sign up for health insurance this year.\nLess than half of the Colorado residents who lost their medical insurance when Colorado HealthOp folded have found new policies through the state health exchange.\nThat cost about 82,000 people their health insurance, and 64,000 of them were insured through the state exchange, officials said.\nConnect for Health Colorado spokesman Luke Clarke said 25,000 former co-op members have found replacement policies through the exchange to date.\nUnder the Affordable Care Act, obtaining health insurance avoids federal tax penalties, and enrolling through the state exchange qualifies the buyer for possible federal tax credits."}
