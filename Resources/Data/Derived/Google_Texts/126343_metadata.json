Thankfully, low capability,\" said John Riggi, a section chief at the FBI's cyber division. \"But the concern is that they'll buy that capability.\"\n\nJackson Lee, a senior member of the House Homeland Security Committee and ranking member on the Judiciary Committee\u2019s Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, Homeland Security, and Investigations, in January introduced the Terrorism Prevention and Critical Infrastructure Protection Act.\n\nThe bill directs DHS to work with critical infrastructure companies to boost their cyber defenses against terrorist attacks, part of a swath of legislation that has attempted to codify the agency\u2019s responsibilities in that area.\n\nLate last year, the Senate passed its version of the House-passed National Cybersecurity and Critical Infrastructure Protection Act.\n\nThe bill officially authorized an already-existing cybersecurity information-sharing hub at DHS.\n\nAlthough a deadly attack on power plants or the electric grid \u2014 a \u201ccyber Pearl Harbor\u201d \u2014 is still only a hypothetical, experts warn critical infrastructure sites are increasingly at risk, as electric grids get smarter.\n\nNational Security Agency Director Michael Rogers told lawmakers last fall that China and \u201cone or two\u201d other countries would be able to shut down portions of critical U.S. infrastructure with a cyberattack. Researchers suspect Iran to be on that list.\n\nIn August, DHS announced the creation of a new subcommittee dedicated to preventing attacks on the power grid.\n\nThe new panel is tasked with identifying how well the department\u2019s lifeline sectors are prepared to meet threats and recover from a significant cyber event.\n\nThe committee will also provide recommendations for a more unified approach to state and local cybersecurity.\n\n\u201cThere is a great deal that has been done and is being done now to secure our networks,\u201d Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson told the House Judiciary Committee in July. \u201cThere is more to do.\"", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "The call comes in response to reports that ISIS is trying to attack the U.S. grid.", "description": "The call comes in response to reports that ISIS is trying to attack the U.S. grid.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Katie Bo Williams", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "The call comes in response to reports that ISIS is trying to attack the U.S. grid.", "title": "Jackson Lee pushes to boost power-grid defenses against ISIS", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/257287-jackson-lee-pushes-to-boost-power-grid-defenses-against-isis", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/thehill_logo_200.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-01T06:17:42-05:00", "type": "article"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-01T06:17-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/257287-jackson-lee-pushes-to-boost-power-grid-defenses-against-isis", "dcterms.date": "2015-10-19T09:38-04:00", "dcterms.creator": "Katie Bo Williams", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": ",Sheila Jackson Lee,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-10-19T09:38:14-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-01T06:17:42-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/257287-jackson-lee-pushes-to-boost-power-grid-defenses-against-isis", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "The call comes in response to reports that ISIS is trying to attack the U.S. grid.", "card": "summary", "title": "Jackson Lee pushes to boost power-grid defenses against ISIS"}, "dcterms.title": "Jackson Lee pushes to boost power-grid defenses against ISIS"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2d50\"", "article_summary": "Late last year, the Senate passed its version of the House-passed National Cybersecurity and Critical Infrastructure Protection Act.\nJackson Lee, a senior member of the House Homeland Security Committee and ranking member on the Judiciary Committee\u2019s Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, Homeland Security, and Investigations, in January introduced the Terrorism Prevention and Critical Infrastructure Protection Act.\n\u201cNo solace should be taken in the fact that ISIS has been unsuccessful,\u201d Jackson Lee said.\n\u201cThere is a great deal that has been done and is being done now to secure our networks,\u201d Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson told the House Judiciary Committee in July.\nThe bill directs DHS to work with critical infrastructure companies to boost their cyber defenses against terrorist attacks, part of a swath of legislation that has attempted to codify the agency\u2019s responsibilities in that area."}
