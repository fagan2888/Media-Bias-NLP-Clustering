“If you’ve got health insurance, you like your doctors, you like your plan, you can keep your doctor, you can keep your plan. Nobody is talking about taking that away from you.” — President Barack Obama

Home Deport has joined the growing number of employers that will no longer offer health insurance benefits to part-time workers. The country’s largest home improvement retailer announced last week that it would instead shift some 20,000 part-timer workers to ObamaCare’s health insurance exchanges:

Employees with fewer than 30 hours a week will no longer be offered limited liability medical coverage, Stephen Holmes, a spokesman, said today by telephone. About 5 percent of Atlanta-based Home Depot’s 340,000 employees are enrolled in that plan.

Home Depot said it is maintaining coverage for full-time workers, though those people will pay more next year, reflecting a rise in the cost of health care. Whether part-timers pay more under the health law’s insurance marketplaces will depend on the type of plans they choose, Holmes said. The company will continue offering part-time employees coverage for dental, vision, critical illness, disability and back-up dependent care, according to Holmes. The Affordable Care Act defines part-time workers as those working fewer than 30 hours a week. Holmes said Home Depot had already been using the 30-hour standard for defining part-time versus full-time work.

Home Depot joins a list of more than 300 employers, both private and public, that have either cut workers’ hours or shifted them to ObamaCare’s state exchanges to avoid added healthcare costs that are a direct result of the 2010 healthcare law. Some employers, such as Walgreens, have shifted workers to a privately-run health insurance exchange, as an alternative to ObamaCare’s state exchanges.
