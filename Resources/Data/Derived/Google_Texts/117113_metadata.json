The National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA) started soon after HMOs became popular in the 1980s, measuring the effectiveness of the first managed care plans as millions of consumers flocked to join them.\n\nThe Washington-based nonprofit\u2019s public reports for decades have helped consumers shop for plans and employers pay the bills. Today, NCQA accredits health plans in every state, covering 109 million Americans or about 70 percent of all Americans enrolled in private coverage.\n\nFounding and current president Margaret \u201cPeggy\u201d O\u2019Kane discussed her organization\u2019s past and future recently with KHN\u2019s Phil Galewitz. This interview has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nWhat do you see as NCQA\u2019s biggest achievement after 25 years?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJust getting the measurements out there in a systematic way. We are now finally at a stage where the delivery system is getting it and trying to reorganize itself with primary care medical homes and accountable care organizations. I see unlimited potential coming out of that.\n\nIs the United States doing a better job for consumers in measuring health plans\u2019 quality of care?\n\nMaybe the glass is half full on measurement, or less than that. I think our strategy was to always walk behind the evidence. We have good measures where there is good evidence on preventive services and chronic diseases like hypertension and diabetes. These important conditions that account for more than half the spending in health care and the complication rates for diabetes are down by half. What we are missing is often in areas where the science is unclear. These also tend to be high-stakes areas of care, like cancer or other complex illnesses. But these are often things that come to mind for consumers when they think about \u201cCan I trust my health plan?\u201d We could definitely be doing better. Other areas where better measurement is needed are care for the frail elderly, where we are coming along. Care for people with physical disabilities. Then there is care for people with serious mental illness, where we have been doing a lot of good work. So work is being done, but we\u2019re not there yet in terms of what\u2019s available to people making choices.\n\nAre health plans receptive to being evaluated by NCQA?\n\nIt\u2019s less than voluntary, I would say. It\u2019s in the health law for exchange plans (to be accredited by NCQA or another accrediting group) and has been driven by employers traditionally. Some state Medicaid programs require us, including Tennessee. Some plans really question whether it matters what (their) quality is. It does if you are the contracting entity and are limiting your offerings of providers to your members. You see narrow networks emerging and if they are chosen just based on price, that isn\u2019t going to go well among consumers. There is an understanding among plans that there is a need for quality measures.\n\nAre consumers using your information to choose health plans?\n\nConsumers for years have been telling us \u201cCan you make it simple?\u201d When I take my car to my mechanic, I do not need to understand all the things that work under the hood, I just need to know it\u2019s OK. In general, we need to be smarter in how we present the information to consumers and realize not everyone is going to use it. We spend lot of time asking \u201cShould we only measure things that speak to consumers?\u201d But if we bundle information, present it in a clear way and allow consumers to dive down for more information if they want to, then we get to where we want to go.\n\nHow much has NCQA\u2019s work improved the quality of health care that Americans receive?\n\nIn the areas we have measured, you can point to real improvements. My main gripe now is what I see as contradictory strategies of high deductibles versus a delivery system reform promoting primary care. If you have to spend out of your own pocket $2,000 or $5,000 before you get to see your primary care physician (for free), many Americans don\u2019t have that money. We are reforming the delivery system and then people can\u2019t afford to see their primary care doctor. That makes no sense.\n\nHas Obamacare pushed the campaign for quality?\n\nIt\u2019s pushed quality a lot. The exchanges have quality measures and require accreditation, and there are lots of other things that have happened. Some things may be consequences of the Affordable Care Act that are not yet understood. As employers deal with the Cadillac tax (on expensive health policies), there is going to be a scaling back of coverage by employers, and I do not know if people will connect dots to ACA, but I think that is a concern.", "article_metadata": {"description": "\"We are now finally at a stage where the delivery system is getting it and trying to reorganize itself with primary care medical homes and accountable care organizations.\"", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "MedCity News", "description": "\"We are now finally at a stage where the delivery system is getting it and trying to reorganize itself with primary care medical homes and accountable care organizations.\"", "title": "What\u2019s next for the National Committee for Quality Assurance?", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://medcitynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/MargaretOKane.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-01-08T08:05:01-04:00", "url": "http://medcitynews.com/2016/01/whats-next-for-the-national-committee-for-quality-assurance/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://medcitynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/MargaretOKane.jpg", "description": "\"We are now finally at a stage where the delivery system is getting it and trying to reorganize itself with primary care medical homes and accountable care organizations.\"", "card": "summary", "title": "What's next for the National Committee for Quality Assurance? - MedCity News"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 148725768475669}, "google-site-verification": "xudQg7nxVR9ifmMTY4Tf-0wVtX9b6rWLQd0utCweGOc", "keywords": "weight loss, obesity, overweight,diabetes,massachusetts,medical devices,obesity,startups,healthcare innovation, medcity news,medcity news,san francisco, startups, life sciences,accelerator,rock health,startup advice,startup funding,patient monitoring system, motion sensors ,dc,healthcare it,washington,foodborne pathogens, diagnostics company, diagnostic platforms,minimally invasive surgery, laser surgery,cambridge,dealflow,hospitals,wellpoint, healthways, health and wellness, employee wellness programs,investing,wellness,medtronic, shanghai innovation center, china, r&d,china,mdt,minneapolis,minnesota,publics,twin cities,ulcerative colitis, abbott labs, humira,abbott labs,doctors,pharmaceuticals,skin disorders, pharmaceuticals, md anderson cancer center,cancer,texas,renal denervation, st. jude medical,st. jude medical,stj,emr, ehr, electronic health records, electronic medical records, certified emr,certified emr,ehr,electronic health records,electronic medical records,advanced cellular technology,amyotrophic lateral sclerosis,embryonic stem cells,geron corporation,lou gehrig\\'s disease,macular degeneration,regenerative medicine,spinal cord damage,value-based healthcare system, obamacare, fee-for-service model,california,cleveland,health insurance,insurance,ohio,pennsylvania,politics,cancer treatment options library, aetna, aet, healthcare it,aet,aetna,health it,phi,philadelphia,Margaret O'Kane, National Committee for Quality Assurance, Washington D.C., , MedCity News", "article": {"section": "Daily", "tag": "Washington D.C.", "published_time": "2016-01-08T08:45:13-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-01-08T08:05:01-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,width=device-width,user-scalable=no,minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3492\"", "article_summary": "The National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA) started soon after HMOs became popular in the 1980s, measuring the effectiveness of the first managed care plans as millions of consumers flocked to join them.\nIs the United States doing a better job for consumers in measuring health plans\u2019 quality of care?\nToday, NCQA accredits health plans in every state, covering 109 million Americans or about 70 percent of all Americans enrolled in private coverage.\nThe nation\u2019s oldest private arbiter of what defines high-quality health plans turned 25 last year.\nMy main gripe now is what I see as contradictory strategies of high deductibles versus a delivery system reform promoting primary care."}
