In his place an interim administrator has been hired until the search concludes for a new administrator.\n\n\"The Supervisors are off to a good year,\" Joe Norwood who is President of the Lauderdale County Board of Supervisors said. \"It's been very busy and right now we are without a county administrator. We have hired a search firm to do a nationwide search in helping us locate the person who will be a good fit here in Lauderdale County.\"\n\nNorwood says that although the interim administrator is no stranger to the job, a new administrator needs to be hired so the interim administrator can go back to her business.\n\n\"Administrator Cheryl Polk who was our interim auditor, who does an outstanding job, has picked up the pace,\" said Norwood. \"This was her second time to do that and we really haven't missed a bit. She just needs some help so that she can get back to what she was hired to do.\"\n\nNorwood says that the search will continue until the right candidate can be hired, but for now the county and the interim administrator are going to continue to focus on building on relationships within the surrounding areas.\n\n\"Relationships are very important,\" Norwood said. \"They say that friends like doing business with there friends. For us here locally, we have had issues and we will continue to have issues, but I think they will get better. We are finding ways to create dialogue not only with the city, but counties surrounding us.\"\n\nFormer county administrator David Engel resigned effective October 12th of last year. The supervisors have been searching for a new administrator since then. Currently, Cheryl Polk is the interim county administrator.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"medium": "video", "description": "Joe Norwood of the Lauderdale County Board of Supervisors says a nationwide search is underway for a county administrator", "language": "english", "author": "Aaron Morrison", "og": {"description": "Joe Norwood of the Lauderdale County Board of Supervisors says a nationwide search is underway for a county administrator", "title": "Nationwide Search for Lauderdale County Administrator", "url": "http://www.wtok.com/home/headlines/Nationwide-Search-for-Lauderdale-County-Administrator-369594691.html", "image": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/21C/A0F/21CA0F88B43C42DA84C11840DA63E744", "video": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/B05/FAE/B05FAE4232F94D62993008DD01E7871B.mp4", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.wtok.com", "description": "Joe Norwood of the Lauderdale County Board of Supervisors says a nationwide search is underway for a county administrator", "title": "Nationwide Search for Lauderdale County Administrator", "url": "http://www.wtok.com/home/headlines/Nationwide-Search-for-Lauderdale-County-Administrator-369594691.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/Board+of+Supervisors+Dodge+Chargers.jpg", "creator": "@newscenter11", "site": "@newscenter11", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "video_type": "video/mp4", "video_height": 288, "keywords": "Nationwide Search for Lauderdale County Administrator", "google-site-verification": "M1YwZ85zoJ2ZNboZjzjADGJ9L53qqzbNOi6FLrtDw9U", "video_width": 512, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Nationwide Search for Lauderdale County"}, "article_summary": "We have hired a search firm to do a nationwide search in helping us locate the person who will be a good fit here in Lauderdale County.\"\nIn his place an interim administrator has been hired until the search concludes for a new administrator.\nCurrently, Cheryl Polk is the interim county administrator.\nNorwood says that although the interim administrator is no stranger to the job, a new administrator needs to be hired so the interim administrator can go back to her business.\nFor nearly 5 months Lauderdale County has been without a full-time Administrator, after the resignation of David Engel last year, following personal and health reasons."}
