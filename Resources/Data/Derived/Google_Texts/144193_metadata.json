Helicopters and fixed-wing planes also carry the versatile laser-guided weapon.\n\n\u201cIt requires a little bit of investment on our part to expand the factories, but the demand is there and we\u2019re keeping up with it [and] we\u2019re staying ahead of it,\u201d St. John said.\n\nIt also requires Pentagon funding. Last June, the U.S. Army gave Lockheed $18 million to boost Hellfire production from 500 to 650 missiles per month. St. John said the company has added tools, test equipment, and floor space to its Hellfire production line.\n\nLockheed has also \u201cquadrupled our production capacity\u201d at the Archbald, Pennsylvania, factory to meet demand from the U.S. and its allies for Paveway II laser-guided bombs.\n\nRelated: US Taxpayers Paid Millions for Shoddy, Unsafe Buildings in Afghanistan\n\nWith top military officials predicting that the ISIS campaign will run for years, demand for missiles and bombs is expected to remain high.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see events in the world changing dramatically over the next couple of years,\u201d St. John said. \u201c[T]he conflicts that are requiring the use of our systems are lingering, so anticipate that we\u2019ll be producing at a pretty high level for some period of time.\u201d\n\nBetween August 2014 and February 2016, the latest month for which Pentagon data is available, American warplanes dropped more than 39,715 bombs, worth some $1.5 billion, on ISIS targets in Iraq and Syria. Last month, Defense Secretary Ash Carter said he had asked Congress for $1.8 billion to buy 45,000 smart bombs in fiscal 2017. In all, the Pentagon plans to spend $1.89 billion on JDAM, Hellfire, and Small Diameter bombs next year, up $337 million for those three weapons this year.\n\nOn Wednesday, Air Force Secretary Deborah Lee James told the House Armed Services Committee, \u201cWe \u2026 need to invest more in munitions.\u201d\n\nNATO and Middle Eastern allies are also believed to want to buy these weapons, Roman Schweizer, an analyst with Guggenheim, said in a March 7 note to investors. Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, and Jordan have all struck ISIS targets in Syria.\n\nMeanwhile, Lockheed is also preparing to build a new generation of weapons that might fight future wars. The firm has added 60,000 square feet to the Troy, Alabama, factory where it builds the Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile, a stealthy cruise missile, St. John said. That expansion will make room to build 110 Long-Range Anti-Ship Missiles, now under development for Navy Super Hornet fighters and Air Force B-1B bombers.\n\nThis article originally appeared on DefenseOne.
