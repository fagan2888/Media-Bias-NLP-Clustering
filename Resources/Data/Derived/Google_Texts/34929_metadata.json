Because the responsibility of the test results fall on the teacher, the test becomes more about how good your teacher is at test-preparation and teaching the material they predict will be on the test. Students get their scores months later, with no opportunity to learn the material they have missed. The purpose of standardized tests should be a learning moment for the student. Standardized testing provides no benefit to students, as they can\u2019t review their own mistakes, it takes away from classroom instruction time, and it puts more stress on teachers and students.\n\nLeonardo Lee, Lakewood\n\nThis letter was published in the Nov. 8 edition.\n\nSubmit a letter to the editor via this form or check out our guidelines for how to submit by e-mail or mail.", "article_metadata": {"Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "language": "en, sv", "og": {"url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/eletters/2015/11/07/standardized-testing-provides-no-benefit-to-students/39754/", "site_name": "eLetters", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/eletters/files/2015/11/standardized-testing-495x330.jpg", "type": "blog", "title": "Standardized testing provides no benefit to students"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "title": "Standardized testing provides no benefit to students", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/eletters/2015/11/07/standardized-testing-provides-no-benefit-to-students/39754/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/eletters/files/2015/11/standardized-testing-495x330.jpg", "creator": "@denveropinion", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "Standardized testing provides no benefit to students, as they can\u2019t review their own mistakes, it takes away from classroom instruction time, and it puts more stress on teachers and students."}, "article_summary": "Standardized testing provides no benefit to students, as they can\u2019t review their own mistakes, it takes away from classroom instruction time, and it puts more stress on teachers and students.\nRe: \u201cObama\u2019s clumsy take on school testing,\u201d Nov. 8 editorial.\nAs a high-school student in Jefferson County Public Schools, I have had experience with PARCC and other standardized tests.\nThe purpose of standardized tests should be a learning moment for the student.\nStudents get their scores months later, with no opportunity to learn the material they have missed."}
