(Reuters) - Apple said on Wednesday that it would delay its fiscal second-quarter earnings report by a day to April 26 due to a memorial service for a former board member.

Apple said many of its executives will be attending the service on Monday for Bill Campbell, a longtime Apple board member who mentored many prominent executives in Silicon Valley.
