The same columnist who once glossed over Obama\u2019s troubles in implementing Obamacare by comparing him to both Superman and Sisyphus now calls him ineffective, confused, and bumbling.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nWith regard to his Middle East policy, Fineman writes, \u201cThe region that initially made him look wise now makes him look, at best, confused.\u201d Fineman rips his rhetoric: \u201che makes sweeping declarations that damage his credibility.\u201d He slams his economic policy: \u201cthe rich have gotten richer while the middle class stagnates.\u201d Fineman blasts Obama\u2019s competence, even while stating in quasi-delusional fashion, \u201chis tenure has been relatively free of venal corruption. But every management is another matter.\u201d\n\nBut, never fear \u2013 Obama\u2019s failures aren\u2019t really his fault, Fineman says. The internet ruined Obama, Fineman explains: \u201cThe internet has gone on to other brands and other trends.\u201d The Republicans ruined Obama, Fineman writes: \u201cOur founders divided the power, and it remains divided.\u201d America\u2019s racism ruined Obama, Fineman states: \u201cA quality that made him inspiring to so many \u2013 the first African-American in the White House \u2013 makes him a dangerous figure to some.\u201d\n\nFinally, Fineman concludes, Obama hasn\u2019t succeeded because he\u2019s just too fabulous. Obama is \u201cfiercely proud and self-assured in public,\u201d but also \u201ccautious and wary.\u201d He \u201cfavors complexity over simplicity.\u201d He\u2019s a charmer who \u201clikes to put others at ease and does not seek confrontation,\u201d and whose \u201cthoughtful, soothing, hopeful nature got him elected\u201d but made him ill-suited for \u201cunpleasant political realities in general.\u201d\n\nObama never should have been expected to meet expectations anyway: \u201cThe expectations for President Obama upon entering office \u201cwere impossible to meet. He hasn\u2019t meet them. No one could.\u201d\n\nActually, America\u2019s expectations were perfectly reasonable: govern, help heal racial wounds, and strengthen America on the global stage. After all, that\u2019s what Obama promised. But for Fineman, a promise made need not be a promise kept, even if he\u2019s disappointed in Obama for not keeping those promises.\n\nBen Shapiro is Senior Editor-At-Large of Breitbart News and author of the new book, The People vs. Barack Obama: The Criminal Case Against The Obama Administration (Threshold Editions, June 10, 2014).
