The raw institutional racism that prevailed before the civil rights movement ended Jim Crow is gone, although subtler discrimination persists. Individual attitudes have changed, too, dramatically in some cases. For example, as recently as the 1980s half of Americans opposed interracial marriage, a position now held by only a tiny minority.\n\nYet racial hatred is still a potent force in our society, as we\u2019ve just been reminded to our horror. And I\u2019m sorry to say this, but the racial divide is still a defining feature of our political economy, the reason America is unique among advanced nations in its harsh treatment of the less fortunate and its willingness to tolerate unnecessary suffering among its citizens.\n\nOf course, saying this brings angry denials from many conservatives, so let me try to be cool and careful here, and cite some of the overwhelming evidence for the continuing centrality of race in our national politics.\n\nMy own understanding of the role of race in U.S. exceptionalism was largely shaped by two academic papers.\n\nThe first, by the political scientist Larry Bartels, analyzed the move of the white working class away from Democrats, a move made famous in Thomas Frank\u2019s \u201cWhat\u2019s the Matter With Kansas?\u201d Mr. Frank argued that working-class whites were being induced to vote against their own interests by the right\u2019s exploitation of cultural issues. But Mr. Bartels showed that the working-class turn against Democrats wasn\u2019t a national phenomenon \u2014 it was entirely restricted to the South, where whites turned overwhelmingly Republican after the passage of the Civil Rights Act and Richard Nixon\u2019s adoption of the so-called Southern strategy.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAnd this party-switching, in turn, was what drove the rightward swing of American politics after 1980. Race made Reaganism possible. And to this day Southern whites overwhelmingly vote Republican, to the tune of 85 or even 90 percent in the deep South.\n\nThe second paper, by the economists Alberto Alesina, Edward Glaeser, and Bruce Sacerdote, was titled \u201cWhy Doesn\u2019t the United States Have a European-style Welfare State?\u201d Its authors \u2014 who are not, by the way, especially liberal \u2014 explored a number of hypotheses, but eventually concluded that race is central, because in America programs that help the needy are all too often seen as programs that help Those People: \u201cWithin the United States, race is the single most important predictor of support for welfare. America\u2019s troubled race relations are clearly a major reason for the absence of an American welfare state.\u201d\n\nNow, that paper was published in 2001, and you might wonder if things have changed since then. Unfortunately, the answer is that they haven\u2019t, as you can see by looking at how states are implementing \u2014 or refusing to implement \u2014 Obamacare.\n\nFor those who haven\u2019t been following this issue, in 2012 the Supreme Court gave individual states the option, if they so chose, of blocking the Affordable Care Act\u2019s expansion of Medicaid, a key part of the plan to provide health insurance to lower-income Americans. But why would any state choose to exercise that option? After all, states were being offered a federally-funded program that would provide major benefits to millions of their citizens, pour billions into their economies, and help support their health-care providers. Who would turn down such an offer?\n\nThe answer is, 22 states at this point, although some may eventually change their minds. And what do these states have in common? Mainly, a history of slaveholding: Only one former member of the Confederacy has expanded Medicaid, and while a few Northern states are also part of the movement, more than 80 percent of the population in Medicaid-refusing America lives in states that practiced slavery before the Civil War.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not just health reform: a history of slavery is a strong predictor of everything from gun control (or rather its absence), to low minimum wages and hostility to unions, to tax policy.\n\nSo will it always be thus? Is America doomed to live forever politically in the shadow of slavery?\n\nI\u2019d like to think not. For one thing, our country is growing more ethnically diverse, and the old black-white polarity is slowly becoming outdated. For another, as I said, we really have become much less racist, and in general a much more tolerant society on many fronts. Over time, we should expect to see the influence of dog-whistle politics decline.\n\nBut that hasn\u2019t happened yet. Every once in a while you hear a chorus of voices declaring that race is no longer a problem in America. That\u2019s wishful thinking; we are still haunted by our nation\u2019s original sin.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "opinion", "ptime": 20150622032104, "twitter": {"description": "Despite changing attitudes on several fronts, race in America is an issue that won\u2019t go away.", "title": "Slavery\u2019s Long Shadow", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/22/opinion/paul-krugman-slaverys-long-shadow.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003750078"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "creator": "PaulKrugman", "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/11/12/opinion/krugman-circular/krugman-circular-thumbLarge-v7.jpg", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/22/opinion/paul-krugman-slaverys-long-shadow.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003750078", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/22/opinion/paul-krugman-slaverys-long-shadow.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "thumbnail_width": 75, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "opinion", "channels": "NytNow", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "June 22, 2015", "edt": "NewYork", "org": "Republican Party", "keywords": "Blacks,Slavery (Historical),Murders  Attempted Murders and Homicides,Discrimination,United States Politics and Government,United States,Southern States (US),Race and Ethnicity,States (US),Welfare (US),Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (2010),Conservatism (US Politics),Republican Party,Charleston (SC),Social Conditions and Trends", "news_keywords": "Blacks African-Americans,Discrimination", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "Paul Krugman", "thumbnail_150": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/11/12/opinion/krugman-circular/krugman-circular-thumbLarge-v7.jpg", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "thumbnail_150_width": 150, "byl": "By PAUL KRUGMAN", "thumbnail_150_height": 150, "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "Despite changing attitudes on several fronts, race in America is an issue that won\u2019t go away.", "tom": "Op-Ed", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "CT": "column", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/11/12/opinion/krugman-circular/krugman-circular-thumbStandard-v5.jpg", "description": "Despite changing attitudes on several fronts, race in America is an issue that won\u2019t go away.", "CN": "paul-krugman", "CG": "opinion", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "June 22, 2015", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "Op-Ed", "article": {"author": "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/opinion/editorialsandoped/oped/columnists/paulkrugman/index.html", "section_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/pages/opinion/index.html", "section": "Opinion", "modified": "2015-06-22", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "tag": "Social Conditions and Trends", "published": "2015-06-22", "section-taxonomy-id": "AD8090D7-4137-4D71-84C8-70DA3BD89778"}, "thumbnail_height": 75, "geo": "Charleston (SC)", "slug": "22krugman", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20150622160945, "hdl_p": "Slavery\u2019s Long Shadow", "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/22/opinion/paul-krugman-slaverys-long-shadow.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/11/12/opinion/krugman-circular/krugman-circular-facebookJumbo-v5.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Despite changing attitudes on several fronts, race in America is an issue that won\u2019t go away.", "title": "Slavery\u2019s Long Shadow"}, "pdate": 20150622, "des": "Social Conditions and Trends", "nyt-collection": {"tone": "opinion", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/column/paul-krugman", "tagline": "Macroeconomics, trade, health care, social policy and politics.", "uri": "/column/paul-krugman", "display-name": "Paul Krugman", "identifier": "paul-krugman", "type": "column"}, "articleid": 100000003750078, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "Slavery\u2019s Long Shadow", "col": "Op-Ed Columnist", "PST": "Op-Ed"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0845\"", "article_summary": "The raw institutional racism that prevailed before the civil rights movement ended Jim Crow is gone, although subtler discrimination persists.\nIs America doomed to live forever politically in the shadow of slavery?\nEvery once in a while you hear a chorus of voices declaring that race is no longer a problem in America.\nYet racial hatred is still a potent force in our society, as we\u2019ve just been reminded to our horror.\nFor example, as recently as the 1980s half of Americans opposed interracial marriage, a position now held by only a tiny minority."}
