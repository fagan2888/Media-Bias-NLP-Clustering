The Tucson Police Department has identified a man who was shot to death on the southwest side in the early hours of Saturday morning.The victim is 25-year-old Travis Martinez, according to TPD Sgt. Kimberly Bay.Tucson Police continue to investigate the incident, which happened in the 1400 block of West Irvington Road, near Midvale Park.Just after 3:30 a.m., officers responded to a report of a man found in the street who had possibly been shot. When they arrived, they found a man who had obviously been shot.The Tucson Fire Department transported him to Banner University Medical Center with life-threatening injuries, and he later died there.News of the murder came as a shock to Joseph Miller of the Midvale Parks Neighborhood Association. The volunteer organization has worked to clean up the community for roughly a decade.Miller said he learned about the crime on his way to a Saturday morning clean-up, and he was shocked because it's been years since the last murder in Midvale Park."There's obviously a problem," he said. "No matter what happened, there was a problem, and a life was lost, and my heart goes out to those families involved."The neighborhood association usually picks up debris and washes over graffiti, but Miller said he noticed a drop in attention to "broken window" issues lately, and he worried a more serious crime could occur. Volunteers have been cleaning up more than the typical trash piles, and Miller said it's a sign that they need help from the city or the county."We understand there's a budgetary crisis that we're all dealing with, but it's a pay me now or pay me later," he said.Detectives request that anyone with information call 911 or the 88-CRIME anonymous tipline.
