They should not start, and if they do start, they should quit. But some people -- many people -- have trouble quitting, so they keep inhaling tobacco smoke and tar and nasty dirty ingredients that increase their chance of getting lung and other cancers and other really horrible diseases, too, such as emphysema and heart disease.\n\nSome of those folks in recent years have been able to quit with the help of nicotine patches or gum, and still others with the help of drugs such as Bupropion (brand names: Zyban, Wellbutrin and Aplenzin), a prescription anti-depressant that helps with nicotine withdrawal symptoms, or Varenicline (brand name: Chantix), which blocks some nicotine receptors in the brain, making smoking less pleasurable and reducing nicotine withdrawal symptoms.\n\nBut not everyone who tries to quit with these devices or drugs, or by willpower alone, has found success.\n\nFor them, e-cigarettes can be lifesaving.\n\nA British study released in 2014 found that, according to WebMD, \"people who wanted to quit smoking were about 60 percent more likely to succeed if they used e-cigarettes compared to would-be quitters who tried an anti-smoking nicotine patch or gum.\"\n\n\"The same 60 percent statistic held,\" WebMD reports, \"when the study authors compared the use of e-cigarettes as a quit-smoking aid to people who tried to quit using willpower alone.\"\n\nThe Guardian has more here.\n\nWe hope Governor Snyder, and policymakers in other states, will agree with our Jeff Stier that keeping e-cigarettes out of the hands of minors but available to people trying to quit smoking is THE BEST policy to save lives.\n\nAs Jeff noted in the Detroit News, the FDA's chief tobacco regulator, Mitch Zeller, has said:\n\nRight now the overwhelming majority of people seeking nicotine are getting it from the deadliest and most toxic delivery system, and that\u2019s the conventional cigarette. But if there is a continuum of risk and there are less harmful ways to get nicotine, and FDA is in the business of regulating virtually all of those products, then I think there\u2019s an extraordinary public health opportunity for the agency to embrace some of these principles and to figure out how to incorporate it into regulatory policies.\n\nIn other words, let's develop smart regulations that give options to people who are trying to quit smoking.\n\nSign the bill, Governor Snyder.
