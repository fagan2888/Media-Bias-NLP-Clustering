Do you have any idea what year it is? Did you fall down, hit your head, and think you woke up in the 1950s? Or the 1890s? Should we call for a doctor? Because I simply cannot believe that in the year 2015 the United States Senate would be spending its time trying to defund women\u2019s health care centers.\n\nBecause it is not. Planned Parenthood is not the only source of women\u2019s health care centers, which the bill makes clear. Margaret Sanger\u2019s brainchild has lately given the public reason to believe that women\u2019s health is not their true priority. She continued:\n\nYou know, on second thought, maybe I shouldn\u2019t be that surprised. Republicans have had a plan for years to strip away women\u2019s rights to make choices over our own bodies. Look at the recent facts. 2013: Republicans threaten to shut down the government unless they could change the law to let employers deny women\u2019s access to birth control. In March of this year, Republicans hold up a non-controversial, bipartisan bill to stop human trafficking. Why? Because they demanded new, anti-abortion restrictions to cover private funding meant to help the victims of human trafficking.\n\nYet Democrats didn\u2019t want to help human trafficking victims unless abortion was included. Priorities? Warren continued to try to distract from Planned Parenthood\u2019s current fetal parts trafficking scandal with something likely out of Planned Parenthood\u2019s own talking points:\n\nIn June, House Republicans passed a budget eliminating funding for the Title X Family Planning Program, the only federal grant program that provides birth control, HIV tests, STD screening, and other preventive services for poor and uninsured people. Over the past few years, Republicans have voted to repeal the Affordable Care Act more than fifty times, including the portions that require insurers to cover contraception.\n\nBecause if you haven\u2019t noticed, lots of Americans decided they really, really don\u2019t like the ACA, and thus voted for people who don\u2019t like it either.\n\nAnd let\u2019s be clear, it\u2019s not just Congress. Over the past five years, Republican state legislators have passed nearly 300 new restrictions on abortion access. This year alone, Republican state legislators have passed more than fifty new restrictions on women\u2019s access to legal health care.\n\nSo when states choose to keep abortion from being a hastily made, uninformed decision, and encourage maternity homes, pregnancy resource centers, and food shelters instead of padding the coffers of a major abortion provider, they\u2019re automatically conspirators against women\u2019s health care? On the contrary. Maybe they\u2019re just more aware of the actual dangers facing women and babies.\n\nSo Madam President, let\u2019s be really clear about something. The Republican scheme to defund Planned Parenthood is not some sort of surprised response to a highly edited video.\n\nDemocrats don\u2019t seem to know there\u2019s more than one video, or that the hours of full, unedited footage of these investigations are readily available. She continued:\n\nNope, the Republican vote to defund Planned Parenthood is just one more piece of a deliberate, methodical, orchestrated, right wing attack on women\u2019s rights, and I\u2019m sick and tired of it. Women everywhere are sick and tired of it. The American people are sick and tired of it. Scheduling this vote during the week of a big Fox News presidential primary debate, days before candidates take trips to Iowa or New Hampshire isn\u2019t just some clever gimmick. This is an all-out effort to build support, to take away a woman\u2019s right to control her own body, and access to medical care she may need.\n\nNo, it\u2019s just about washing taxpayers\u2019 hands of a corrupt organization, regardless of what it provides, and redirecting the money to worthier health care centers.\n\n\u2026 One in five women in America is a Planned Parenthood patient at least once in her life. Every single year, nearly 2.7 million women and men show up for help at Planned Parenthood. Why do so many people use Planned Parenthood? Because they\u2019re non-profit, and they\u2019re open. More than half of Planned Parenthood centers are located in areas without ready access to health care.\n\nEven FactCheck.org notes that the frequent claim of how many women\u2019s lives value Planned Parenthood is questionable at best: \u201cWe asked Planned Parenthood for the source of that statistic, but we have yet to hear back.\u201d\n\nYou know, women who can\u2019t get appointments anywhere else go to Planned Parenthood for Pap tests and cancer screening. Couples go to Planned Parenthood for STD treatments or pregnancy tests. Young people go to Planned Parenthood for birth control. And yes, 3% of patients visit Planned Parenthood for a safe and legal abortion with a doctor who will show compassion and care for a woman who is making one of the most difficult decisions of her entire life.\n\nRich Lowry of National Review sums it up best: \u201cBy Planned Parenthood\u2019s math, a woman who gets an abortion but also a pregnancy test, an STD test, and some contraceptives has received four services, and only 25 percent of them are abortion. This is a little like performing an abortion and giving a woman an aspirin, and saying only half of what you do is abortion. Such cracked reasoning could be used to obscure the purpose of any organization. The sponsors of the New York City Marathon could count each small cup of water they hand out (some 2 million cups, compared with 45,000 runners) and say they are mainly in the hydration business. Or Major League Baseball teams could say that they sell about 20 million hot dogs and play 2,430 games in a season, so baseball is only .012 percent of what they do. . .If abortion is really incidental to what it\u2019s all about, it could give up the alleged 3 percent. But it will never do it. Abortion is just a tiny portion of what it does exactly the way the heart is a small muscle in the body.\u201d\n\nBut just to be clear, even though the abortions performed at Planned Parenthood are safe and legal, the federal government is not paying for any of them, not one dime. For almost forty years the federal government has prohibited federal funding for abortions except in the case of rape, incest, or life endangerment.\n\nIf there are multiple exceptions then you can\u2019t assuredly say \u201cnot one dime.\u201d Furthermore, we\u2019ve had evidence over the years that the federal funding for Planned Parenthood doesn\u2019t stay as clean as Warren says. Regardless, why should any shady organization be given millions of dollars a year in taxpayer money?\n\nMost of the money Planned Parenthood receives from the government comes in the form of Medicaid patients, for medical care provided to low income patients, the same payments that any other doctor or clinic receives for providing cancer screenings or other medical exams. The rest of Planned Parenthood\u2019s federal funding comes from Title X that provides birth control to low income and uninsured people, the same program the House Republicans voted to cut in June.\n\nCitizens don\u2019t like having their money funneled to organizations they don\u2019t trust, no matter how much you insist it\u2019s for the good of the people. \u201cOf all tyrannies,\u201d wrote C.S. Lewis, \u201ca tyranny sincerely exercised for the good of its victims may be the most oppressive.\u201d\n\nThe government doesn\u2019t fund abortions, period. A vote today to defund Planned Parenthood is not a vote to defund abortions. It\u2019s a vote to defund cancer screenings and birth control and basic health care for millions of women.\n\nLike the breast cancer screenings Planned Parenthood claims to do but doesn\u2019t? If the vote to defund Planned Parenthood was a vote to deprive women of health care, the text of the bill would not have specified that the money cut from Planned Parenthood would be given instead \u201cto other eligible entities to provide women\u2019s health care services.\u201d Preferably entities that aren\u2019t so morally dubious.\n\nI want to say to my Republican colleagues: The year is 2015, not 1955 and not 1895.\n\nIt\u2019s not 1525 B.C. Egypt either, where \u201canother boy!\u201d meant you were supposed to break a baby\u2019s neck or dispose of him in the Nile if he was inconveniently Hebrew. It\u2019s also not 1942 Germany, where unwanted human beings could be treated as specimens for research. We have no excuse for devaluing human life in American society.\n\nWomen have lived through a world where backward-looking ideologues tried to interfere with the basic health decisions made by a woman and her doctor, and we are not going back, not now, not ever. The Republican plan to defund Planned Parenthood is a Republican plan to defund women\u2019s health care. For my daughter, for my granddaughters, for people all across Massachusetts and people all across this country, I stand with Planned Parenthood, and I hope my colleagues will do the same.\n\nPerhaps partly because Planned Parenthood gave Senator Warren $16,242 to help her get elected in 2012.\n\nPhotograph by Edward Kimmel.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Planned Parenthood gave Sen.
