Elsbeth Dowd, museum registrar at the Sam Noble Oklahoma Museum of Natural History, says archaeologists found a number of artifacts under the mounds.\n\nBut how did a piece of lace survive? The mounds were actively used from 800 to 1450 AD. In a University of Oklahoma press release, Dowd says it survived because of its probable proximity to copper plates, whose metallic properties served as a preservation tool.\n\n\u201cThis fragment of lace survives as one of Oklahoma\u2019s oldest textiles and offers previously unknown information about the way Native Americans lived centuries ago,\u201d Dowd said in the release.\n\nShe believes a lot can be learned about textile production of the time from the piece of lace.\n\n\u201cWe are thrilled the Spiro Lace was chosen as one of the Top 10 Most Endangered Artifacts,\u201d said Michael Mares, San Noble Museum director. \u201cWe are working hard to ensure this piece and our entire collection receives proper care so we can continue to share these treasures with visitors for many years to come.\u201d\n\nRead about all the endangered artifacts here.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Lace found at the Spiro Mounds by a University of Oklahoma excavation team has been classified as one of the state\u2019s most endangered artifacts.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.creator": "leeanne", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2013/09/06/lace-spiro-mounds-classified-endangered-artifact-151158", "type": "article", "image": "http://d1jrw5jterzxwu.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/article_media/spiro-mounds.jpg", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "title": "Lace From Spiro Mounds Classified as Endangered Artifact"}, "dcterms.date": "2013-09-06T10:00-04:00", "dc": {"title": "Lace From Spiro Mounds Classified as Endangered Artifact"}, "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2013/09/06/lace-spiro-mounds-classified-endangered-artifact-151158", "robots": "follow, index", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "University of Oklahoma, Spiro Mounds, artifacts, Sam Noble Museum of Natural History, Native American History", "validation_code": "d9d37d7b776cc351c4025ded3df21cad", "sioc": {"num_replies": 0}, "dcterms.title": "Lace From Spiro Mounds Classified as Endangered Artifact"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe05de\"", "article_summary": "\u201cWe are thrilled the Spiro Lace was chosen as one of the Top 10 Most Endangered Artifacts,\u201d said Michael Mares, San Noble Museum director.\nLace found at the Spiro Mounds in eastern Oklahoma by a University of Oklahoma excavation team in the 1930s has been classified as one of the state\u2019s top 10 most endangered artifacts.\nElsbeth Dowd, museum registrar at the Sam Noble Oklahoma Museum of Natural History, says archaeologists found a number of artifacts under the mounds.\nShe believes a lot can be learned about textile production of the time from the piece of lace.\n\u201cWe are working hard to ensure this piece and our entire collection receives proper care so we can continue to share these treasures with visitors for many years to come.\u201dRead about all the endangered artifacts here."}
