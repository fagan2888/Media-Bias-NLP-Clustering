Both feature plastic handlebars, three wheels and a foot brake. Both weigh about five pounds.\n\nThe only significant difference is the price, a new report reveals. Target listed one for $24.99 and the other for $49.99.\n\nThe scooters\u2019 price gap isn\u2019t an anomaly. The New York City Department of Consumer Affairs compared nearly 800 products with female and male versions \u2013 meaning they were practically identical except for the gender-specific packaging \u2013 and uncovered a persistent surcharge for one of the sexes. Controlling for quality, items marketed to girls and women cost an average 7 percent more than similar products aimed at boys and men.\n\nDCA Commissioner Julie Menin, who launched the investigation this summer, said the numbers show an insidious form of gender discrimination. Compounding the injustice, she said, is the wage gap. Federal data show women in the United States earn about 79 cents for every dollar paid to men.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a double whammy,\u201d Menin said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not just happening in New York. You see in the aisles the issue is clearly applicable to consumers across the country.\u201d\n\nA Target spokesman said the company lowered the price of the pink scooter after the report was released Friday, calling the discrepancy a \u201csystem error.\u201d (The retailer blamed the same kind of glitch last year after catching heat for selling black Barbies at more than double the price of white Barbies.)\n\nWhen asked about the price differences of other gendered toys \u2013 like the Raskullz shark helmet ($14.99) and the Raskullz unicorn helmet ($27.99) or the Playmobil pirate ship ($24.99) and the Playmobil fairy queen ship ($37.99) \u2013 the representative pointed to a company statement, declining to elaborate: \u201cOur competitive shop process ensures that we are competitively priced in local markets. A difference in price can be related to production costs or other factors.\u201d\n\nResearchers for the New York City Department of Consumer Affairs pored over toys, children\u2019s clothing, adult apparel, personal care products and home goods sold in the city. The largest price discrepancy emerged in the hair care category: Women, on average, paid 48 percent more for goods like shampoo, conditioner and gel. Razor cartridges came in second place, costing female shoppers 11 percent more.\n\nWalgreens, for example, peddled a blue box of Schick Hydro 5 cartridges for $14.99. The Schick Hydro Silk, its purple sibling, was priced at $18.49.\n\nAcross the New York sample, women\u2019s products carried higher price tags 42 percent of the time, while men\u2019s products cost more 18 percent of the time.\n\nBoosting prices according to who\u2019s buying is nothing new. Hairdressers often charge women more. Nightclubs sometimes demand more cash from men for admission.\n\nPrice discrimination on the whole tends to be worse for women, though. A 1994 report from the state of California found they pay an annual \u201cgender tax\u201d of $1,351 for the same services for men.\n\nWomen spend an average of 25 percent more on haircuts (that require the same amount of labor as a men\u2019s style) and 27 percent more for the laundering of a white cotton shirt, a 2002 DCA study showed.\n\nAnother analysis from the University of Central Florida found women\u2019s deodorants typically cost 30 cents more than the same product for men. Wrote the authors, \u201cThe only discernible difference was scent.\u201d\n\nThe pricing differences extend beyond basic services and goods. Until courts knocked the practice down, insurance companies in Europe charged women more because women live longer. Under the Affordable Care Act, insurance companies in the United States cannot factor gender into cost.\n\nNew York City law has banned gender discrimination in the pricing of services since 1998. Businesses cannot legally charge more for haircuts or dry cleaning, for example, based on the patron\u2019s sex. They must instead offer gender-neutral rates by labor intensity.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean local companies always follow the rules. DCA inspectors issued 129 violations for gender pricing of services this year, compared with 118 in 2014.\n\nCalifornia and Florida\u2019s Miami-Dade County also prohibit selling the same services to men and women at different prices. No federal law, though, requires businesses to set gender-equal prices on products. New York City\u2019s report was released to heighten consumer awareness, Menin said, and to publicly shame companies with glaring disparities.\n\nOf the 24 retailers in the New York City report, the worst gender pricing disparity surfaced at Club Monaco, where women\u2019s clothing cost an average of 28.9 percent more than men\u2019s clothing, according to an independent analysis by economist Ian Ayres. Urban Outfitters trailed with a 24.6 percent gender premium, followed by Levis with 24.3 percent.\n\nThe retailers did not respond to the Post\u2019s request for comment.\n\nIn 1991, Ayres, a professor at Yale Law School, sent men and women to car dealerships across the Chicago area. He learned white women were charged 40 percent more than white men, supporting the stereotype that dealers assume women knew less about car values.\n\nGender equality has improved considerably since Ayres\u2019 paper was published \u2013 so why do blatant price disparities persist today? \u201cOne contributing factor is profitability,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re pulling an extra dollar out of a certain group of consumers.\u201d\n\nCompanies might be exploiting the idea that female shoppers are willing to spend more money than their male counterparts, he said.\n\nOf course, a woman\u2019s sweater might be crafted with nicer fabrics. A man\u2019s sweater might be stitched with cheaper polyester. But that often isn\u2019t the case. Frequently, the only difference between two products is color.\n\n\u201cThose prices aren\u2019t being driven by costs,\u201d Ayres said, \u201cbut just because you take advantage of certain groups but not others.\u201d\n\nRavi Dhar, director of the Center for Customer Insights at the Yale School of Management, said how we perceive women\u2019s products could help explain why gender mark ups persist in the marketplace.\n\n\u201cMany men\u2019s products are not seen as men\u2019s products,\u201d he said. \u201cThey might just be seen as products in the category.\u201d\n\nWhich makes the pink version a specialty product, he said. \u201cHis\u201d and \u201chers\u201d items likely stemmed from a retailer\u2019s embrace of gender stereotypes, but our appetites for personally tailored goods could have kept the distinction alive.\n\n\u201cPeople see a greater fit between the product and their tastes,\u201d Dhar said, \u201cand may be willing to pay more.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"content_section": "business", "description": "Business: Want to know a retail secret?
