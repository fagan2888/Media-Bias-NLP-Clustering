Last week, five infants at an Illinois daycare center were diagnosed with the disease and a 1-year-old in New Jersey was confirmed to have it as well.\n\nWorse still, the outbreak may not be over.\n\nIn late January, the California Department of Public Health warned the disease could spread further.\n\nAlong with being a terrible disease for sufferers and their families, measles is also a nightmare for public health officials to contain. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), if one person has the disease, 90 percent of the people close to that person who are not immune will also become infected. The virus is airborne and can linger in public spaces hours after the carrier has left a room. Sufferers can be contagious for days before they experience symptoms.\n\nRelated: How a Discredited Report Turned Parents Into Anti-Vaxxers\n\nThese features of measles add up to lots of work and steep costs for public health officials to contain even a small outbreak. Studies based on prior outbreaks show that costs easily run to more than $10,000 per case. That\u2019s not enough to dent the U.S. economy, but it poses risks for specific communities if they are subject to a large and prolonged outbreak. For example, a 2008 outbreak in San Diego, California, that began with an unvaccinated boy and led to 11 cases, cost $124,517 to contain, according to a 2010 study published in the journal Pediatrics.\n\nThe public sector costs of treating each case each was $10,376, including the 1,745 person hours spent on \u201cinvestigation and containment efforts,\u201d according to the study. Direct medical costs totaled $1,347 and expenses related to quarantining 48 children who were too young to be vaccinated equaled $775 per patient.\n\nA CDC study published in the journal Vaccine noted that there were 16 measles outbreaks in 2011 that resulted in 107 cases and cost public health departments between $2.7 million and $5.3 million to combat. \"Beyond the impact on local and state public health departments, responses to measles outbreaks also affect hospitals, clinics, as well as non-health public departments such as schools, universities and occasionally local police departments enforcing quarantines,\" authors of the CDC study note.\n\nThose figures don\u2019t include costs incurred by the patients, which are considerable as well. Measles sufferers often require hospitalization. They can get complications like pneumonia and encephalitis (swelling of the brain) that can be deadly.\n\nA Los Angeles hospital charged around $9,264 per patient during a resurgence of the infection in the 1990s, according to a 2004 report in the Journal of Infectious Diseases. That figure has no doubt risen in the intervening years.\n\nRelated: Obama Cuts Vaccine Program, Despite Measles Outbreak\n\nOne reason the disease is still a risk is because the high costs of treatment and containment make it hard for developing countries to eradicate. \u201cIn many countries, resources are not available to treat measles cases or for adequate hospital care for patients with complications,\u201d notes a report in the Journal of Infectious Diseases.\n\nThe U.S. is the largest country to have outbreaks of the disease. \u201cMeasles is the greatest vaccine-preventable killer of children in the world today and the eighth leading cause of death among persons of all ages,\u201d according to the Journal of Infectious Diseases.\n\nIn the U.S., the measles vaccine is widely available and 99 percent effective. But a growing trend of parents choosing not to vaccinate their children is making the U.S. more susceptible to outbreaks, despite its relative wealth.\n\nRelated: How the New Medicare Proposal Could Affect You\n\nThe case outlined in the Pediatrics article highlights the risk. An unvaccinated 7-year-old, who caught the disease while traveling in Europe, exposed 839 people to the virus and caused 11 measles cases in children who also lacked protection against the highly contagious disease. Among those who caught the disease were the carrier\u2019s brother and sister.\n\nThe Pediatrics study found that the parents who hadn\u2019t vaccinated their children tended to be college-educated, white and adherents to what they consider to be a \u201cnatural lifestyle.\u201d Moreover, they also believed in the debunked notion of a link between autism and vaccines. These issues have also come up during the current outbreak and have been the subject of some political debate.\n\n\u201cAs long as there have been vaccines, there have been people opposed to them,\u201d said Dr. Daniel Salmon, deputy director of Johns Hopkins\u2019 Institute for Vaccine Safety, in an interview. \u201cWe have to do a better job with communication.\u201d\n\nNot surprisingly, it\u2019s far more cost effective to prevent the disease in the first place than to contain outbreaks. Data from the CDC pegs the cost of the MMR vaccine, which also protects against mumps and rubella, at $19 per dose for the public sector, and $60 per dose in the private sector.\n\n\u201cInsurance and federal government programs cover the costs of vaccines for most kids, so the only cost to parents is the cost of taking their kid to the doctor and any co-\u00adpay,\u201d writes Kimberly Thompson, the head of Kid Risk, a non-profit that focuses on vaccine research, in an email to The Fiscal Times.\n\nFor families, that is a small price to pay to keep their children healthy. For public health officials, it may seem an even smaller price to avoid the nightmare and extra costs of controlling a large outbreak.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Studies show public health officials spend at least $10,000 per case to contain an outbreak \u2013 and sometimes much more.", "title": "Just One Case of Measles Costs More Than $10,000", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/02/08/Just-One-Case-Measles-Cost-More-10000", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/05042012_Young_Doctors_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/02/08/Just-One-Case-Measles-Cost-More-10000", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/05042012_Young_Doctors_article.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Studies show public health officials spend at least $10,000 per case to contain an outbreak \u2013 and sometimes much more.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Studies based on prior outbreaks show that costs easily run to more than $10,000 per case.\nIn the U.S., the measles vaccine is widely available and 99 percent effective.\nAlong with being a terrible disease for sufferers and their families, measles is also a nightmare for public health officials to contain.\nFor public health officials, it may seem an even smaller price to avoid the nightmare and extra costs of controlling a large outbreak.\nRelated: How a Discredited Report Turned Parents Into Anti-VaxxersThese features of measles add up to lots of work and steep costs for public health officials to contain even a small outbreak."}
