Is there a way to meet face-to-face with someone who can help me shop for a health plan and tell me if I\u2019m eligible for premium subsidies?\n\nA: There\u2019s a simple answer to your question. And then there\u2019s the painful truth.\n\nAs President Obama said on Monday from the Rose Garden, the simple answer is to call the Obamacare helpline at 800-318-2596 any time day or night.\n\n\u201cWe are redoubling our efforts to make sure you can buy the same quality health insurance the old-fashioned way, either over the phone or in person,\u201d the President said. \u201cThe call centers are up and running.\u201d\n\nA call center staffer should be able to help you apply for coverage and subsidies, as well as give you the phone number of a community organization closest to your zip code that is ready to help you face-to-face to pick a health plan on your state\u2019s Obamacare insurance exchange. If you run into trouble at healthcare.gov, the old-fashioned way can work beautifully\u2014but only sometimes.\n\nThe painful truth is that the call center\u2014despite 10,000 staffers under a $300 million contract\u2014is currently amateurish. It needs to be fixed fast, along with healthcare.gov. Depending on the state you live in, you may have a very frustrating time actually connecting with anyone who can help you buy complicated health insurance and get whatever federal subsidies you may be eligible to collect.\n\nI say that based on my experience trying to help friends shop for Obamacare coverage in New York and New Jersey, plus interviews with experts and staff at the Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nMy New York experience went as smoothly as the president could wish. A call center helper directed me to three local community organizations. I phoned one, and two days later a staffer called back with an appointment for my friend near where she lives in Brooklyn. No fuss, no muss.\n\nBut New Jersey\u2014one of 36 states where the federal government is operating the online exchange, rather than the state government, like New York\u2014was a mess. When I phoned the call center on Wednesday, the helper referred me to a rebate card outfit with an arm-long list of scam warnings on the Internet.\n\nHere\u2019s what happened. My friend in Hackensack wanted to meet face-to-face with one of the government\u2019s trained non-profit advisers, either a \u201ccounselor\u201d who could help her apply or a \u201cnavigator\u201d who could tell her what she\u2019d pay after subsidies and actually enroll her. But the call center staffer I reached\u2014who was obviously reading from scripts\u2014drew a blank for helpers in my friend\u2019s zip code. After a few tries at an adjacent zip code, he gave me an 888 phone number.\n\nHe didn\u2019t know the name of the organization he referred me to, but he assured me that people there had \u201ccomprehensive training,\u201d and could provide the \u201cnavigator assistance\u201d my friend wanted.\n\nInstead, the 888 number connected me to a Utah company selling $100 rebate cards to big-box stores. Joelene tried very hard to get my credit card number before she would \u201cpoint me in the right direction\u201d about finding health insurance. I refused. Then Crystal tried to get my card number before finally admitting that the company had nothing to do with the Affordable Care Act.\n\nI phoned the call center again. This time, after initially drawing a blank, a helper told me I could find a \u201ccertified counselor,\u201d rather than a \u201cnavigator,\u201d at Team Management 2000 in Hackensack. She wasn\u2019t certain about the differences between a counselor and a navigator, but she was sure someone at Team Management could help me.\n\nIf only that were true. When I called there, a staffer said her CEO is \u201cnot participating in Obamacare because she couldn\u2019t get answers to get up and running.\u201d\n\nThe staffer referred me to the North Hudson Community Action Corporation; she was pretty sure I could find help there. Perhaps I can, but I couldn\u2019t get through to anyone to find out. North Hudson\u2019s phone service kept looping back to its greeting message. Press 1 to talk to someone got me back to press 1 to talk to someone. And the nhcap.org website was down.\n\nAt this point, I reached out to people at HHS and other Obamacare supporters for advice.\n\nUnfortunately I got conflicting advice. Anthony Wright, executive director of Health Access California, said it might be best to wait until around Thanksgiving. He said the problems should be cleared up by then, and he added: \u201cThe family\u2019s health care is a great thing to discuss around the Thanksgiving table.\u201d I think he was joking.\n\nA spokesman at HHS suggested instead that I get help immediately at localhelp.healthcare.gov. When you enter your zip code at that site, you should get a list of local community organizations ready to give you guidance.\n\nLocalhelp got me a step closer to arranging an appointment for my friend in Hackensack, but it was far from ideal. The website provided a list of 140 outfits offering Obamacare \u201capplication assistance\u201d near her home. However, no one at the first group I phoned\u2014the Hyacinth Foundation of Jersey City\u2014has yet completed the five-hour training required to become a \u201ccertified counselor.\u201d A friendly staffer there told me to call back in a week or so. \u201cWe\u2019re working out the kinks,\u201d she said, \u201clots of kinks.\u201d\n\nTwo other organizations I called last week have yet to call back.\n\nAlso, for some reason, localhelp\u2019s 140 \u201cassistance\u201d organizations did not include the five New Jersey community organizations that accepted $2 million in federal aid in August to become navigators. It\u2019s reasonable to think navigators should be enrolling applicants by now\u2014and also should be listed at localhelp.healthcare.gov.\n\nIn yet another frustrating experience, a friend who couldn\u2019t log in at healthcare.gov last week applied for her family of five through the call center and got left with more questions than answers.\n\nHer youthful-sounding helper said it was his first day. He also thought her Social Security number was \u201ccool.\u201d But at the end of the 45-minute session, and after checking with supervisors, all he could say was that someone would either call or email with more information about actually enrolling in a health plan between now and January 1. December 15 is the last day to enroll to get health insurance coverage beginning January 1. Now, she\u2019s worried her family may not get coverage for the entire year.\n\n\u201cThe whole experience was amateur hour,\u201d my friend said.\n\nIn general, the online exchanges run by the states with the help of federal planning money, like the New York exchange, have been performing better than those operated by HHS. In New Jersey, for example, Gov. Chris Christie vetoed a bill this summer to create a state exchange with more than $15 million in federal aid \u2014a move the Newark Star Ledger said damaged the state and showed an \u201cindifference to the hardships of low-income families.\u201d\n\nI believe in Obamacare. I agree with the many experts who say these start-up problems\u2014like those that plagued Medicare Part D under President Bush\u2014will get solved eventually, and millions of working- and middle-class people will get affordable health coverage next year, many for the first time in their lives.\n\n\u201cNo one is madder than me about the website not working as well as it should,\u201d the President said on Monday. \u201cWhich means, it\u2019s going to get fixed.\u201d\n\nBut I also agree with President Obama\u2019s former press secretary Robert Gibbs, who said on MSNBC last week: \u201cWhen they get this fixed, I hope they fire some people who were in charge of making sure this thing was supposed to work.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Q: My daughter and I stopped trying to shop for Obamacare health insurance on the government website after two hours of computer crashes and frozen screens.
