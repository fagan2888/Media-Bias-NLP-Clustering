Three union locals at the Jersey City Medical Center are to vote on a contract agreement which would give them a stake in performance bonuses the hospital may receive for providing quality care under Obama Care.

Under the Affordable Care Act’s “Value-Based Purchasing” philosophy, hospitals will be paid by health insurance providers based on the quality of care they provide and not merely the quantity of services they provide. The higher the quality of service, based on certain criteria, the more the hospital would receive.

“We are offering competitive salaries plus pay for performance,” Medical Center Vice-President of Human Resources Mary Caudella said. “When we meet goals, all get bonuses.”

The new contract, if ratified, would allow union members to share in bonuses for quality of service, thereby incentivizing quality care, Jersey City Medical Center spokesman Mark Rabson said.

Taking the vote tomorrow and Friday are American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees 1199J members, which represents 500 Medical Center nurses, Rabson said.

Also voting are AFSCME Council 52 locals 2254 and 3680 which represents 600 Medical Center workers with jobs such as respiratory therapists, environmental services, paramedics, clerks, mental health workers, transporters and laboratory and other technicians jobs, Rabson said.



“With the changes in healthcare reflected nationally we asked our unions to work with us in meeting these new goals,” Rabson said. “These are based around the hospital’s four pillars of patient safety, clinical quality, patient satisfaction/engagement and the hospitals overall financial picture.”

If ratified, the contracts would run through 2017, Rabson said.

The nurses’ union leader said today that she did not want to comment until after the vote. The union leader for the other two locals could not be reached for comment.
