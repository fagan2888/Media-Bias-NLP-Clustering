Furthermore, the poor results were despite insurers receiving substantial subsidies\u2014indeed, more than they originally expected\u2014through the Affordable Care Act\u2019s \u201creinsurance\u201d program. Specifically, they found that aggregate insurer losses were in excess of $2.2 billion, despite insurers receiving net reinsurance payments of $6.7 billion.\n\nThey also discovered wide variation in insurer performance selling exchange plans in 2014. Insurers with narrow provider networks appear to have done relatively well, while the Affordable Care Act created health insurance cooperatives, established with government funding, incurred the greatest losses.\n\nAdditionally, the authors estimate that without the reinsurance subsidies, average exchange premiums in 2014 would have needed to be 26 percent higher to cover insurer costs. But they point out,\n\nIf premiums had been 26 percent higher, on average, enrollment would have been lower and adverse selection would have increased. Relatively healthy people and higher income enrollees, who qualify for smaller subsidies if they qualify for any subsidies, would have been deterred to a greater degree than people who expected to use more health care services. As a result of this dynamic effect, the premium increase would likely have needed to be substantially greater than 26 percent for insurers to break even on their Qualified Health Plans in 2014.\n\nThat is significant because the Affordable Care Act set the reinsurance program to operate for only the years 2014 through 2016. Thus, starting in 2017, insurers will need to charge premiums for exchange plans that are high enough to cover their costs without those subsidies.\n\nAs Haislmaier and his colleagues note, \u201cthe key question is whether insurers that continue offering Qualified Health Plans can reverse their losses through some combination of higher premiums and [insurance] plan redesign.\u201d\n\nOf course, another possibility is that in the coming months more insurers will simply follow the lead of UnitedHealthcare and head for the exits.", "article_metadata": {"description": "UnitedHealthcare\u2019s decision may soon be followed by similar announcements from other health care insurers.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "UnitedHealthcare\u2019s decision may soon be followed by similar announcements from other health care insurers.", "title": "An Insurance Exodus From Obamacare Could Come in 2017", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/160503_Obamacare_RK.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-05-16T17:35:30+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1W7iRZ7"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "UnitedHealthcare\u2019s decision may soon be followed by similar announcements from other health care insurers.", "title": "An Insurance Exodus From Obamacare Could Come in 2017", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/160503_Obamacare_RK.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Health Care", "tag": "obamacare", "published_time": "2016-05-03T17:37:55+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-05-16T17:35:30+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Subsides, Obamacare,"}, "article_summary": "Thus, starting in 2017, insurers will need to charge premiums for exchange plans that are high enough to cover their costs without those subsidies.\nThey also discovered wide variation in insurer performance selling exchange plans in 2014.\nThat is significant because the Affordable Care Act set the reinsurance program to operate for only the years 2014 through 2016.\nFurthermore, the poor results were despite insurers receiving substantial subsidies\u2014indeed, more than they originally expected\u2014through the Affordable Care Act\u2019s \u201creinsurance\u201d program.\nInsurers with narrow provider networks appear to have done relatively well, while the Affordable Care Act created health insurance cooperatives, established with government funding, incurred the greatest losses."}
