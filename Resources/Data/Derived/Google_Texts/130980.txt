America’s growing obsession with beauty is bolstering a rapid rise in cosmetic procedures. Nearly $14 billion was spent on these procedures last year, the most since this data began being recorded in 1997, according to a new report from the American Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery.

The group says 12.8 million surgical and minimally invasive procedures were performed in 2015, up 20 percent from the year before. Surgical procedures grew 7 percent, while nonsurgical procedures like botox injections surged 22 percent.

Making your behind look like J.Lo’s, otherwise known as buttock implants, are currently the fastest growing type of cosmetic surgery. Too rare to be tracked in 2000, there were 20,713 procedures in 2015.

Liposuction is the most common cosmetic procedure, performed nearly 400,000 times last year, up 16 percent from the year before and 124 percent from 1997. Americans spent just under $1.3 billion on liposuction in 2015, with each individual procedure costing an average of $3,176.

Botox injections, which have ranked as the top nonsurgical procedure since 2000, were performed 4.2 million times last year. Collagen and other fillers came in second among non-surgical procedures, with chemical peels, laser hair removal and microdermabrasion right behind.

For the first time, data for different kinds of fat grafting was available for 2015. Fat transfers to the face ranked as the ninth most popular surgical procedure, with 48,059 procedures conducted.
