Arcade Fire at Barclays Center. I’ve been following their music more or less obsessively for years, but this was my first live concert. It’s quite an experience — watching the videos doesn’t give you anything like the feel for the sheer energy and joy, both of the band and the audience. I have to admit that the sound in a big arena is a bit murky — the bass was too loud — so it helped if you already knew and loved all the songs, which I did. Wake Up was a stunning climax, as always.

Really fantastic. Oh, and let’s hear it for the great city of New York, where the subways run all night, and a guy taking the 2 train at midnight in a monkey suit attracts no attention at all.
