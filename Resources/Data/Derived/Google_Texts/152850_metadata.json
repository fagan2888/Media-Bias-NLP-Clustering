Lamar Alexander was asked whether or not he supported Rep. Marsha Blackburn\u2019s bill to block President Obama\u2019s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) and touted his support for the Senate \u201cGang of Eight\u201d amnesty bill in response.\n\nAlexander did cosponsor the Senate version of the Blackburn bill, introduced by Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX).\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nImmigration hawks cite the Gang of Eight bill as helping create a perception in Central America that people who cross the border won\u2019t be deported.\n\nIn separate remarks at a campaign stop over the weekend, Alexander actually accused opponents of the Gang of Eight bill of backing amnesty.\n\n\u201cIn 2013, I voted to end amnesty for 11 million Americans who are illegally here\u2026I voted to double border security and I voted to create a legal immigration system. If you are opposed to that, then you\u2019re for amnesty,\u201d Alexander said, according to the Chattanooga Times Free Press.\n\nState Sen. Joe Carr\u2019s campaign pounced on the remarks, noting that several members of Tennessee\u2019s congressional delegation, including Blackburn, opposed the Gang of Eight bill, making Alexander\u2019s remarks an attack on them.\n\n\u201cReps.
