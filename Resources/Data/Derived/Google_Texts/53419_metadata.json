In addition to recording music and performing shows, they have to deal with millions of obsessive fans who watch their every single move.\n\nThe guys are reportedly hard at work on their next musical endeavor, a record Liam Payne thinks will send the naysayers and detractors scrambling back into the woodwork. If you aren\u2019t a fan now, then the singer things you will be very soon.\n\n\u201cPeople say we don\u2019t work hard and it\u2019s all a game and whatever. We just wanna make good music, and this album \u2014 honestly, every lad out there tonight who\u2019s thinking One Direction are this and that. Literally, next album \u2014 pick up our album and see what you feel,\u201d Payne recently told Capital FM.\n\nRumors started circulating not too long ago that One Direction was on the verge of breaking up. Unless Liam Payne is trying to distract everyone from the truth, it would appear the fellas have no plans to go their separate ways anytime soon.\n\n\u201cWe have been writing away for the next album and rehearsals are just about to start soon for the tour. We\u2019re not splitting up. We\u2019re on WhatsApp messaging each other all the time, talking about song ideas and just funny stuff from our day,\u201d Payne recently explained.\n\nThe singer continued, \u201cIt\u2019s been a while since we have all been together so we are enjoying being back in each other\u2019s company.\u201d\n\nHarry Styles also reassured fans that the group isn\u2019t going anywhere. The Inquisitr previously reported that the One Direction singer denied internet rumors that the guys were splitting up.\n\nReports about the breakup seem to have originated on Twitter. After Niall Horan posted that he hadn\u2019t seen his bandmates in quite some time, people started to worry that the glue that holds One Direction together was finally starting to weaken.\n\nFirst time we have all been together for a while now! lookin forward t seeing the lads! #BRITs2014\u2014\n\nNiall Horan (@NiallOfficial) February 19, 2014\n\nUnfortunately, Liam Payne didn\u2019t say when fans can expect the new One Direction album in stores. Hopefully the guys will have something ready to rock before the end of the year. Were you worried the fellas were thinking about breaking up?\n\n[Image via JStone / Shutterstock.com]", "article_metadata": {"description": "Liam Payne thinks One Direction will win over a new legion of fans when their new album finally drops.
