Maybe this is why President Obama has allowed so few questions following his recent statements concerning ObamaCare. This is an unpopular law that is being promoted with empty slogans and outright lies.\n\nBut tough questions must be asked. Here are five of my suggestions:\n\nQuestion 1: \u201cWhy do you refer to ObamaCare as a law that is already in place when your administration has been treating it as a malleable bill for three years?\u201d There are many examples of administrative actions taken that contradict the wording of the Affordable Care Act, but here are a few: over 1200 ObamaCare waivers have been granted since the law\u2019s passage, primarily to labor unions. The administration has also abandoned the CLASS Act part of ObamaCare, and the administration has recently announced a delay of two years for the employer mandate. None of these actions have any basis in the wording of the law as passed by Congress.\n\nSo why not make a few more changes to ObamaCare, especially if they are supported by the general public? Republicans in Congress only seem to be taking their cue on the changeability of ObamaCare from the Obama administration itself. It is pretty inconsistent to spend three years changing a law and then claim that because it is a law, with the president\u2019s signature, that the law cannot be changed. Of course it can be changed \u2013 President Obama has been changing it on the fly for three years!\n\nQuestion 2: \u201cWhy is it so wrong to bargain with congressional Republicans on a continuing resolution that changes some or all of ObamaCare when you have essentially been bargaining with your supporters on ObamaCare since it passed three years ago?\u201d This is the problem with granting waivers and exemptions from the law that is binding on the general public. Apparently it is fine to bargain with supporters of the administration \u2013 and that is what it is, an implicit bargain for continued political support -- but not OK to bargain with Republicans.\n\nI will answer my own question here, which is that the Republicans cannot threaten to withdraw political support for President Obama, because Republicans are the loyal opposition. But the question should be asked anyway. It exposes the cynicism at work here.\n\nQuestion 3: \u201cWhen you were a senator in 2006 and a Republican president requested that Congress raise the debt ceiling, you spoke on the Senate floor that such a request showed a \u2018lack of leadership\u2019 and you voted against the increase. Now your aide compared congressional Republicans who oppose raising the debt limit to terrorists and arsonists. Do you stand by that characterization?\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s face it: President Obama is asking senators and representatives to vote \u201cyes\u201d on something. And instead of meeting with these people and making the case for a higher debt limit, he calls them names and threatens them with blame for a \u201cno\u201d vote or not acting at all. Not only is this childish, but it is also unrealistic. Calling people names is not a good way to get them to do what you want them to do.\n\nQuestion 4: \u201cWhy not equalize the applicability of ObamaCare to everyone, including yourself, the entire executive branch, Congress, their staffs and families?\u201d This different treatment may be the most annoying part of ObamaCare.\n\nThe public has watched with disgust the shenanigans in Washington, where healthcare policies for the political class and federal workers are exempt from the healthcare laws that apply to the rest of us. Even the IRS agents who are in charge of enforcing ObamaCare on the rest of us do not want to be subject to it.\n\nQuestion 5: \u201cHow could you have been so wrong in promising a $2,500 annual drop in healthcare premiums for a typical family of four under ObamaCare?\u201d President Obama mentioned this figure many times throughout his 2008 campaign, and in the months preceding the passage of the law. President Obama may claim that he was making a good faith projection, but the reality is that when he repeatedly made this promise he was way off. Instead of going down, most family\u2019s healthcare costs are going up. Way up. Healthcare premiums may well replace the mortgage, food and car payments as a typical American family\u2019s top monthly expense.\n\nSo, after all these and other questions, a typical ObamaCare supporter might complain of ineffective messaging \u2013 they usually do. But in this case the Obama administration has already pledged $67 million to over 100 organizations to help \u201cnavigate\u201d consumers through their health insurance options under ObamaCare. Celebrities have signed up to help promote ObamaCare. Now NBC News has decided to spend a whole week extolling the virtues of ObamaCare.\n\nMaybe NBC News can persuade me that the letter I received last week telling me of a 71% premium increase, for a worse health insurance policy, was not in fact true. Or maybe NBC News can tell thousands of employees whose hours were dropped to part-time because of ObamaCare, that their demotions were for the best. ObamaCare is a disaster and anyone trying to sugarcoat it or even explain it has a tough road to hoe.\n\nReality is difficult to hide.\n\nFreedom Center pamphlets now available on Kindle: Click here.", "article_metadata": {"rating": "general", "description": "What the president doesn't want you to ask.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"site_name": "Frontpage Mag", "description": "What the president doesn't want you to ask.", "title": "Five Game-Changing Questions on ObamaCare", "url": "http://www.frontpagemag.com/fpm/205975/five-game-changing-questions-obamacare-tom-thurlow", "updated_time": "2015-06-22T23:38:16-04:00", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.frontpagemag.com/fpm/205975/five-game-changing-questions-obamacare-tom-thurlow", "description": "What the president doesn't want you to ask.", "card": "summary", "title": "Five Game-Changing Questions on ObamaCare"}, "article": {"published_time": "2013-10-01T20:37:12-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-06-22T23:38:16-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0a65\"", "article_summary": "Maybe this is why President Obama has allowed so few questions following his recent statements concerning ObamaCare.\nWell-thought out questions about ObamaCare directed at President Obama would not result in the same fate, but politically-speaking, they could be just as much of a game-changer.\nRepublicans in Congress only seem to be taking their cue on the changeability of ObamaCare from the Obama administration itself.\nSo, after all these and other questions, a typical ObamaCare supporter might complain of ineffective messaging \u2013 they usually do.\nDo you stand by that characterization?\u201dLet\u2019s face it: President Obama is asking senators and representatives to vote \u201cyes\u201d on something."}
