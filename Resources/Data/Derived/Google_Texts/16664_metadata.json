Once again, if Congress and the White House fail to agree on either a temporary continuing spending resolution (CR) or a full-fledged agreement to end the spending curbs imposed by the Budget Control Act of 2011, a government shutdown of non-essential services will ensue.\n\nThat\u2019s what happened for 16 days in 2013, costing the economy billions, and costing Republicans and American politicians even more\u2014a loss of faith in status-quo government. Over the last two years, American voters have given Congress some of the lowest single-digit approval ratings ever. President Obama hasn\u2019t fared much better, with his favorability ratings under 50 percent for many months.\n\nRelated: Another Government Shutdown? Washington Prepares for a Nervous Breakdown\n\nThe dysfunction at the highest levels of government has given rise to the \u201coutsider\u201d phenomenon among today\u2019s presidential candidates\u2014people who have never been elected to any government office. Donald Trump, Ben Carson and Carly Fiorina are three of those outsiders.\n\nIn 2013, preparation for the shutdown was almost non-existent. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) then headed by Sylvia Burwell who now heads Health and Human Services, called for an orderly shutdown. But only a handful of agencies actually had a plan, so it was a last-minute scramble for many when it should have been a smooth transition.\n\nThis time, however, OMB made sure there were contingency plans in place.\n\n\u201cAgency heads, in consultation with their general counsels, must develop and maintain plans for an orderly shutdown in the event of a lapse in appropriations. Up-to-date plans must be on file with OMB,\u201d the guidance said. \u201cWhenever there is a change in the source of funding for an agency program or any significant modification, expansion, or reduction in agency program activities, the agency must submit an updated plan to OMB for review that reflects this change.\u201d\n\nRelated: As Clock Ticks, Senate Seeks to Avert a Shutdown\n\nThe submissions were created for \u201cprudent planning,\u201d OMB spokesperson Emily Cain told Government Executive, adding the \u201cexercise is not dependent on the current status of appropriations.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are now in a situation where we may need\u201d to implement the plans, Cain said. Congress has until the end of day on Sept. 30 to reach a deal to stave off a shutdown, and the path to doing so is still unclear.\n\nThere\u2019s still hope that Congress will come to its senses before the end of the month, which is also the end of the federal fiscal year.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Federal agencies are dusting off their overused shutdown plans in anticipation of anot", "title": "As Government Shutdown Looms, Federal Workers Prepare for Furloughs", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/09/23/Government-Shutdown-Looms-Federal-Workers-Prepare-Furloughs", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/08012012_lincoln_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/09/23/Government-Shutdown-Looms-Federal-Workers-Prepare-Furloughs", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/08012012_lincoln_article.jpg", "creator": "@jackieleo", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Federal agencies are dusting off their overused shutdown plans in anticipation of anot", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Federal agencies are dusting off their overused shutdown plans in anticipation of another forced work stoppage.\nThere\u2019s still hope that Congress will come to its senses before the end of the month, which is also the end of the federal fiscal year.\nThe Office of Management and Budget (OMB) then headed by Sylvia Burwell who now heads Health and Human Services, called for an orderly shutdown.\n\u201cAgency heads, in consultation with their general counsels, must develop and maintain plans for an orderly shutdown in the event of a lapse in appropriations.\nOver the last two years, American voters have given Congress some of the lowest single-digit approval ratings ever."}
