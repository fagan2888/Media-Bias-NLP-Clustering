That\u2019s partly because highly pedigreed Oscar fare might attract hardware for the mantel, but gorefests have proven to be a safer box office bet.\n\nToronto premieres like Eli Roth\u2019s \u201cThe Green Inferno\u201d have acquisition groups circling in hopes of recreating earlier festival successes like \u201cInsidious\u201d or Mr. Roth\u2019s 2002 directorial debut, \u201cCabin Fever.\u201d\n\nDescribed as a \u201cgruesome homage to the notorious Italian cannibal movies of the late seventies and early eighties,\u201d Mr. Roth\u2019s movie is attracting the most attention leading up to its Saturday night premiere. Like Mr. Roth\u2019s \u201cHostel\u201d series, \u201cThe Green Inferno\u201d follows a group of wayward college students who find themselves fending for their lives (and body parts). Other Midnight Madness titles include \u201cAll Cheerleaders Die\u201d and \u201cRigor Mortis.\u201d\n\nThe Midnight Madness movies \u2013 which include everything from \u201cravenous biological monstrosities\u201d to a \u201craging inferno of axe murders and alien abduction\u201d \u2013 are a popular counterpoint to the festival\u2019s daytime offerings, which include arty heavyweights like Weinstein Co.\u2019s \u201cAugust: Osage County.\u201d\n\nThis year\u2019s Midnight Madness movies are premiering in a promising year for scary movies, one that saw low-budget horror films consistently outperform other genres \u2013 even big-budget summer \u201ctentpole\u201d features made for ten times the production cost.\n\nThe January release of \u201cMama\u201d from Comcast Corp.\u2019s Universal Pictures kicked off the trend. The Jessica Chastain movie was produced for $15 million and went on to gross $71.6 million domestically. Summer hits like Universal\u2019s \u201cThe Purge\u201d ($3 million budget, $64.5 million gross) and Time Warner Inc.\u2019s Warner Bros. July release \u201cThe Conjuring\u201d ($20 million budget, $134 million gross) were a better return on investment than some big-budget releases like Walt Disney Co.\u2019s \u201cThe Lone Ranger\u201d or \u201cAfter Earth\u201d from Sony Corp.\u2019s Sony Pictures Entertainment.\n\nIt\u2019s a promising market, but past Toronto Midnight Madness titles have yielded into mixed box office results. \u201cYou\u2019re Next\u201d was picked up at the 2011 festival and has grossed only $15 million since being released last month by Lions Gate Entertainment Corp.\n\nOthers have made the jump more successfully. In 2010, \u201cInsidious\u201d was acquired by Sony Corp.\u2019s Sony Pictures and distributed in April 2011 by FilmDistrict. The movie, which had a production budget of $1.5 million, went on to gross $54 million at the domestic box office \u2013 certainly enough to justify the \u201cInsidious Chapter 2\u201d sequel being released next week.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "The Toronto International Film Festival's \u201cMidnight Madness\u201d tradition of showing horror movies like \"The Green Inferno\" in the wee hours is stealing a little buzz from some of the event\u2019s awards contenders.", "title": "\u2018The Green Inferno\u2019 Helps Bring New Blood to Toronto Film Festival", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2013/09/06/the-green-inferno-helps-bring-new-blood-to-toronto-film-festival/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/OB-YU950_greeni_G_20130906205748.jpg"}, "site": "WSJspeakeasy", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Arts", "article.headline": "\u2018The Green Inferno\u2019 Helps Bring New Blood to Toronto Film Festival", "description": "The Toronto International Film Festival's \u201cMidnight Madness\u201d tradition of showing horror movies like \"The Green Inferno\" in the wee hours is stealing a little buzz from some of the event\u2019s awards contenders.", "article_section": "Arts", "author": "Erich Schwartzel", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "Speakeasy Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "Speakeasy", "article.summary": "The Toronto International Film Festival's \u201cMidnight Madness\u201d tradition of showing horror movies like \"The Green Inferno\" in the wee hours is stealing a little buzz from some of the event\u2019s awards contenders.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2013-09-07T01:01:05-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-141", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2013/09/06/the-green-inferno-helps-bring-new-blood-to-toronto-film-festival/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-SEB-76798", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Arts", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "The Toronto International Film Festival's \u201cMidnight Madness\u201d tradition of showing horror movies like \"The Green Inferno\" in the wee hours is stealing a little buzz from some of the event\u2019s awards contenders.", "title": "\u2018The Green Inferno\u2019 Helps Bring New Blood to Toronto Film Festival", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2013/09/06/the-green-inferno-helps-bring-new-blood-to-toronto-film-festival/", "image": {"width": 553, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/OB-YU950_greeni_G_20130906205748.jpg", "height": 369}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Speakeasy", "article.id": "BL-SEB-76798", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2013-09-07T01:16:23-04:00"}, "article_summary": "In 2010, \u201cInsidious\u201d was acquired by Sony Corp.\u2019s Sony Pictures and distributed in April 2011 by FilmDistrict.\nIt\u2019s a promising market, but past Toronto Midnight Madness titles have yielded into mixed box office results.\nLike Mr. Roth\u2019s \u201cHostel\u201d series, \u201cThe Green Inferno\u201d follows a group of wayward college students who find themselves fending for their lives (and body parts).\nThe festival\u2019s \u201cMidnight Madness\u201d tradition of showing horror movies like \u201cThe Green Inferno\u201d in the wee hours is already stealing a little buzz from some of the event\u2019s awards contenders.\nWorldview Entertainment Sky Ferreira in \u201cThe Green Inferno.\u201dA lot of blood is being spilled at the Toronto International Film Festival \u2013 and not just by producers ramping up their Oscar campaigns."}
