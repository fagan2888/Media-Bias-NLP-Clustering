Sam Brownback and the Republican-led Legislature on issues such as taxes, school funding, environmental and economic policies.\n\nBut even the people who commissioned the poll concede that Democrats have an uphill battle in convincing voters to trust them to govern on those issues.\n\n\"If Democrats want to be taken seriously, they\u2019ve got to do something on these issues,\" said Chris Reeves, a partner in the Democratic consulting firm Smoky Hills Strategies.\n\nThe poll was released just days before the Kansas Democratic Party's midyear \"DemoFest\" convention in Wichita.\n\nIt also comes at a time when there is internal wrangling within the party over whether it should try to \"re-brand\" itself going into the 2016 elections, and whether Democrats should offer more concrete proposals on policy issues rather than simply criticizing Brownback and the Republicans over theirs.\n\nThe survey of 1,217 likely voters was conducted Aug. 5-6 by Public Policy Polling, a firm based in North Carolina that polls for Democratic and progressive campaigns and organizations. It had a margin of error of plus or minus 2.8 percent.\n\nAmong its findings:\n\n\u2022 76 percent of those responding said the state's sales tax rate is now too high after Kansas lawmakers raised it this year to 6.5 percent.\n\n\u2022 72 percent believe business owners should have to pay Kansas personal income taxes like everyone else. (They were exempted in the tax cuts Brownback pushed through in 2012.)\n\n\u2022 62 percent think Kansas doesn't spend enough money on public education.\n\n\u2022 59 percent say they want Kansas to expand its Medicaid program, as allowed under the federal Affordable Care Act, or \"Obamacare.\"\n\n\u2022 57 percent say the state minimum wage should be raised to either $10 or $15 an hour.\n\n\u2022 43 percent want the state to re-enact the renewable portfolio standards on electric utilities, which Republicans repealed this year; and 27 percent think those standards should be stricter, requiring power companies to produce 30 percent of their power from renewable sources instead of the 20 percent required under the now-repealed law.\n\nPatrick Miller, a political science professor at Kansas University, said those numbers are consistent with another poll this spring conducted by Fort Hays State University. But he said he's not surprised that elected officials in Kansas tend to enact more conservative policies.\n\n\"These attitudes also reflect generally the opinions Kansans expressed in a number of polls throughout 2013 and 2014,\" Miller said. \"But, like in many states, there is a larger incentive for politicians to be responsive to what their primary voters want than what the public at large thinks.\"\n\nKansas GOP Chairman Kelly Arnold said he wasn\u2019t concerned about the polling numbers, and he doesn\u2019t believe they provide any useful information heading into the 2016 elections.\n\n\u201cIf Kansas Democrats want to run on raising taxes to expand Obamacare, be my guest,\u201d he said.\n\nRe-branding Democrats\n\nFollowing three consecutive \u201cclean-sweep\u201d victories at the polls by Kansas Republicans, a division has opened up within Democratic ranks over how to appeal to a broader segment of voters.\n\nThat \u201cschism,\u201d as Reeves has called it, was on full display at the party\u2019s last Washington Days convention in Topeka, where western Kansas Democrats like former House Minority Leader Dennis McKinney openly criticized party leaders for focusing almost exclusively on urban voters while ignoring places like southeast Kansas, which was once a Democratic stronghold.\n\nMcKinney said that attitude was illustrated when Dakota Loomis, the party\u2019s former communications director, posted an online comment about \u201ccraphole small towns\u201d in southeast Kansas.\n\nMore recently, the party\u2019s new chairman, Larry Meeker, has been actively trying to re-brand the party, but those efforts appear to be ruffling even more feathers.\n\nMeeker was quoted this week in The Pitch, a Kansas City-based alternative newspaper, as saying he wanted to change the party\u2019s name to \u201cRed State Democrats,\u201d dropping the word \u201cKansas,\u201d while portraying themselves as fiscal conservatives.\n\nIn a Wichita Eagle article Wednesday, Meeker walked back from that statement, saying he was misinterpreted. But he went on to say that Democrats need to acknowledge that Kansas is a Republican state. And he tried to distance the state party from the national party by saying the typical Kansas Democrat would be considered a moderate Republican in states like California and Massachusetts.\n\nWhether that comparison is accurate or not, Reeves said it did not sit well with the party\u2019s financial donor base. And it also helped expose another rift within the party over efforts, both in election campaigns and in the Legislature, to form coalitions with moderate Republicans rather than pushing hard for a Democratic agenda.\n\nThose are issues likely to be discussed, although more likely in private conversations than in public speeches, when the party gathers this weekend in Wichita.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://worldonline.media.clients.ellingtoncms.com/static/ljworld.com/images/ljw-logo-1200.jpg"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "838210bb7516e410bc8c21296a3f4c71"}, "verify-v1": "gH80Ag1lqccG7ja9rd9z9OVq+8uJ+3fJZ2MidSps9r0=", "bitly-verification": "ca3dbde26ba5"}, "article_summary": "The poll was released just days before the Kansas Democratic Party's midyear \"DemoFest\" convention in Wichita.\n\u201cIf Kansas Democrats want to run on raising taxes to expand Obamacare, be my guest,\u201d he said.\nDemocratic operatives in Kansas are touting new polling numbers this week that show most Kansans are more moderate than Gov.\nAnd he tried to distance the state party from the national party by saying the typical Kansas Democrat would be considered a moderate Republican in states like California and Massachusetts.\nBut even the people who commissioned the poll concede that Democrats have an uphill battle in convincing voters to trust them to govern on those issues."}
