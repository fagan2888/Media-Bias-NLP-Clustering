Acting as trusted third parties, they required all commercial insurance carriers within their borders to hand over their claims data, including the prices paid.\n\nIn the last three years, the number of states investing in these painstaking data collection projects has accelerated. Nineteen states have APCDs in varying stages of development and at least 21 states are considering laws to create them, according to the APCD Council, which assists states in setting up claims databases.\n\nDesigned to shed light on the disparate prices doctors and hospitals charge for the same procedures, APCDs have been used by consumers deciding where to go for arthroscopic knee surgery, for example. The pricing and quality data has also been used by insurance companies and large employers to design cost-effective benefit plans. State officials have used APCDs to inform health policy development and measure results.\n\nCritics question whether these complex state databases are worth the effort. Consumer advocates, large employers and most economists argue they are.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThey take a lot of time,\u201d said Christopher Koller, former insurance commissioner for Rhode Island, and president of the Milbank Memorial Fund, a health policy research group. But they have been invaluable to some states in measuring the performance of their health care systems, he said.\n\nFollowing is a primer on the proliferation of state APCDs and how they are used:\n\nWhat are all-payer claims databases?\n\nAPCDs typically include nearly all medical, mental health, pharmacy and dental claims from all providers in the state. The information is provided by all major payers, including commercial insurers, Medicaid and Medicare. Some states also require large employers to provide claims data for their self-funded health plans.\n\nConsumer privacy is protected by using codes rather than the names and addresses of patients, and confidential business information is protected by providing the median of prices paid to providers for specific services, rather than the individual prices negotiated by each insurance company for each type of insurance plan they offer.\n\nSome states use the data to create cost comparison websites for consumers. Maine\u2019s website, for example, allows residents to search for providers for specific procedures by zip code and compare prices and the number of procedures performed. Utah and New Hampshire have similar sites, and Colorado plans to launch one this month. Others offer the data to researchers and use it internally to inform health care policy and insurance regulation.\n\nWhy are these databases needed?\n\nNo other major market operates under the kind of secrecy found in the U.S. health care industry where insurance companies individually negotiate the price of each procedure with each hospital and physician, leaving consumers, employers and providers mostly in the dark. Until price and quality of services data are made available to the public, economists say little progress can be made on cutting cost growth.\n\nPatients and the doctors who order their procedures typically make decisions about which providers to use with little price or quality knowledge. Prices are revealed only after services are provided. That would make sense if provider fees were roughly similar. But claims data show wide variation in pricing and quality of service among providers nationwide and even within the same community.\n\nFor example, the cost for an appendectomy in California ranges from $1,500 to more than $180,000\u2014even within the same county, according to a recent article published by the American Medical Association. The cost of an uncomplicated knee or hip replacement at 36 different hospitals across the country varies from about $17,000 to more than $35,000, according to an analysis of claims data by the National Institute for Health Care Reform.\n\nWhich states have APCDs?\n\nColorado, Kansas, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Hampshire, Oregon, Tennessee, Utah and Vermont have databases that are up and running and can be used by researchers to analyze costs.\n\nConnecticut, New York, Rhode Island, Virginia and West Virginia are developing new databases, and California, Washington and Wisconsin have voluntary databases created by commercial carriers and large employers.\n\nAlaska, Arkansas, Arizona, Delaware, Florida, Illinois, Hawaii, Iowa, Idaho, Kentucky, Louisiana, Montana, Michigan, New Mexico, Nebraska, New Jersey, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Texas and Wyoming are considering laws that would create APCDs.\n\nWhat information can be derived from the data?\n\nClaims databases have a wide variety of uses. State officials have used the information to compare the prices local hospitals charge or to track total statewide spending over time. The data has also been used to determine the performance of individual physicians and hospitals by analyzing the services they provided for patients with specific diagnoses.\n\nFor example, claims data can reveal whether a doctor followed nationally recommended medical protocols for treating patients diagnosed with diabetes. How many received quarterly exams? Did they receive an eye exam? How many were admitted to a hospital?\n\nEmployers, insurance carriers and managed care companies can compare their own claims data to those of all payers in their region to gauge whether they are getting the best value from the hospitals and physicians in their networks.\n\nConsumer use of claims information is limited. But as more employers and insurance companies offer high-deductible health plans, consumer use of pricing information is expected to rise.\n\nThe theory is that reliable, accurate and complete cost and quality information will empower consumers to make better decisions about their care. They may decide, for example, not to use high-priced hospitals and other health care providers unless their quality and customer satisfaction ratings are equally high. That, in turn, could force providers to either lower their prices or improve their care, or both.\n\nBut health economists argue that putting pricing data in the hands of referring physicians, health plans and employers is far more likely to affect buying decisions and push down prices than providing the information directly to consumers.\n\nSome insurance companies are using cost data to design plans that include financial incentives such as lower copays to drive customers to high-value providers. Some are also developing cheaper policies with limited networks that include only high-value providers. State Medicaid programs and other large payers are also designing payment schemes that include incentives for doctors and hospitals to keep down the total cost of care.\n\nHow much do they cost and who pays?\n\nThe cost varies among states. Maine has spent about $5 million since 2002. New Hampshire has spent $3 million since 2005. Maryland and Massachusetts spend about $1 million per year. Colorado spent $2.4 million in its first full year of operation. According to the APCD Council, New Hampshire uses state general funds, Vermont assesses a fee on health plans, Utah uses Medicaid dollars and Maine and Colorado fund their operations by charging researchers who use the data.\n\nAre other groups collecting and analyzing health care pricing data?\n\nYes. For more than 20 years, the Dartmouth Atlas Project has documented huge and inexplicable variations in local, regional and national health care prices in the U.S., using Medicare data. Other organizations, including local and regional industry groups, physicians and other provider organizations are also assembling and analyzing health care cost data to help consumers make better decisions about where they receive care.\n\nA national nonprofit group, the Health Care Cost Institute, announced last month that it is creating a consumer website using nationwide data voluntarily provided by three major insurance companies: Aetna, Humana and UnitedHealthcare. Slated to go live in early 2015, the site will include claims data from commercial Medicare Advantage plans and Medicaid and be available to consumers, purchasers, regulators and payers in an easy-to-use, comparable format.\n\nSome insurance companies also make pricing and quality data available to their subscribers and present it in the context of where the consumer is in their deductible. This type of \u201cprice transparency\u201d is especially useful to consumers, because it lets them know how much of the fee will come out of their own pockets.\n\nDoes anyone oppose claims databases?\n\nNot exactly. At the federal and state level, the issue is nonpartisan. Some doctors and hospitals, however, take issue with the way claims data are presented. Although most major health care industry groups endorse the concept of so-called price transparency, some object to the use of APCDs to determine overall value. They argue that clinical data about the varying health of their patients is needed to provide an accurate picture of a physician\u2019s or hospital\u2019s value.\n\nInsurance carriers also endorse the overall concept, but question the varying data collection methods. \u201cThere is broad agreement that greater transparency in health care offers a roadmap for controlling costs,\u201d wrote Clare Krusing, a spokesperson for America\u2019s Health Insurance Plans, in an email. \u201cHowever, there needs to be a discussion about what the states are looking for and how to provide that information in a way that protects individuals\u2019 privacy and is less costly and complex than creating a new data entity.\u201d\n\nAre APCDs worth the effort?\n\nIt depends who you ask.\n\nDenise Love, director of the APCD Council, works with states to develop effective claims databases. \u201cThey are absolutely worth the money,\u201d she says. \u201cStates spend billions on health care. Spending a million or so to better manage those costs makes a lot of sense.\u201d\n\nWilliam Kramer, who heads the Pacific Business Group on Health, which represents large employers, says states are in the best position to collect claims data from all payers. Businesses can look at their own claims data, but without complete data from all payers, they don\u2019t know who the best hospitals and doctors are.\n\nBut David Newman, who directs the Health Care Cost Institute, says pricing and quality data should not be collected in 50 separate databases. \u201cEvery state is using its own consultant to do it uniquely,\u201d he said. \u201cIt needs to be done using national standards so that data can be compared across states.\u201d\n\nRobert Murray, a consultant who previously directed Maryland\u2019s hospital regulatory agency, said the usefulness of a state APCD depends on how timely, accurate and complete the data are. He suggested states conduct periodic audits to check accuracy.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Nearly a decade before the Affordable Care Act, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire and a few other states began creating all-payer claims databases (APCDs).\u00a0 Acting as trusted third parties, they required all commercial insurance carriers within their borders to hand over their claims data, including the prices\u00a0paid.

For example, the cost for an appendectomy in California ranges from $1,500 to more than $180,000\u2014even within the same county, according to a recent\u00a0article\u00a0published by the American Medical Association. The cost of an uncomplicated knee or hip replacement at 36 different hospitals across the country varies from about $17,000 to more than $35,000, according to an\u00a0analysis\u00a0of claims data by the National Institute for Health Care Reform. Which states have APCDs? Colorado, Kansas, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Hampshire, Oregon, Tennessee, Utah and Vermont have databases that are up and running and can be used by researchers to analyze costs. Connecticut, New York, Rhode Island, Virginia and West Virginia are developing new databases, and California, Washington and Wisconsin have voluntary databases created by commercial carriers and large employers. Alaska, Arkansas, Arizona, Delaware, Florida, Illinois, Hawaii, Iowa, Idaho, Kentucky, Louisiana, Montana, Michigan, New Mexico, Nebraska, New Jersey, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Texas and Wyoming are considering laws that would create APCDs. What information can be derived from the data? Claims databases have a wide variety of uses. \u00a0State officials have used the information to compare the prices local hospitals charge or to track total statewide spending over time. The data has also been used to determine the performance of individual physicians and hospitals by analyzing the services they provided for patients with specific diagnoses. For example, claims data can reveal whether a doctor followed nationally recommended medical protocols for treating patients diagnosed with diabetes. How many received quarterly exams? Did they receive an eye exam? How many were admitted to a hospital? Employers, insurance carriers and managed care companies can compare their own claims data to those of all payers in their region to gauge whether they are getting the best value from the hospitals and physicians in their networks. Consumer use of claims information is\u00a0limited. But as more employers and insurance companies offer high-deductible health plans, consumer use of pricing information is expected to rise. The theory is that reliable, accurate and complete cost and quality information will empower consumers to make better decisions about their care. They may decide, for example, not to use high-priced hospitals and other health care providers unless their quality and customer satisfaction ratings are equally high. That, in turn, could force providers to either lower their prices or improve their care, or both. But health economists argue that putting pricing data in the hands of referring physicians, health plans and employers is far more likely to affect buying decisions and push down prices than providing the information directly to consumers. Some insurance companies are using cost data to design plans that include financial incentives such as lower copays to drive customers to high-value providers.\u00a0 Some are also developing cheaper policies with limited networks that include only high-value providers. State Medicaid programs and other large payers are also designing payment schemes that include incentives for doctors and hospitals to keep down the total cost of care. How much do they cost and who pays? The cost varies among states. Maine has spent about $5 million since 2002. New Hampshire has spent $3 million since 2005. Maryland and Massachusetts spend about $1 million per year. Colorado spent $2.4 million in its first full year of operation.\u00a0 According to the APCD Council, New Hampshire uses state general funds, Vermont assesses a fee on health plans, Utah uses Medicaid dollars and Maine and Colorado fund their operations by charging researchers who use the data. Are other groups collecting and analyzing health care pricing data? Yes. For more than 20 years, the\u00a0Dartmouth Atlas Project\u00a0has documented huge and inexplicable variations in local, regional and national health care prices in the U.S., using Medicare data. Other organizations, including local and regional industry groups, physicians and other provider organizations are also assembling and analyzing health care cost data to help consumers make better decisions about where they receive care. A national nonprofit group, the Health Care Cost Institute,\u00a0announced\u00a0last month that it is creating a consumer website using nationwide data voluntarily provided by three major insurance companies: Aetna, Humana and UnitedHealthcare. Slated to go live in early 2015, the site will include claims data from commercial Medicare Advantage plans and Medicaid and be available to consumers, purchasers, regulators and payers in an easy-to-use, comparable format. Some insurance companies also make pricing and quality data available to their subscribers and present it in the context of where the consumer is in their deductible. This type of \u201cprice transparency\u201d is especially useful to consumers, because it lets them know how much of the fee will come out of their own pockets. Does anyone oppose claims databases? Not exactly. At the federal and state level, the issue is nonpartisan. Some doctors and hospitals, however, take issue with the way claims data are presented. Although most major health care industry groups endorse the concept of so-called price transparency, some object to the use of APCDs to determine overall value. They argue that clinical data about the varying health of their patients is needed to provide an accurate picture of a physician\u2019s or hospital\u2019s value. Insurance carriers also endorse the overall concept, but question the varying data collection methods. \u201cThere is broad agreement that greater transparency in health care offers a roadmap for controlling costs,\u201d wrote Clare Krusing, a spokesperson for America\u2019s Health Insurance Plans, in an email. \u201cHowever, there needs to be a discussion about what the states are looking for and how to provide that information in a way that protects individuals\u2019 privacy and is less costly and complex than creating a new data entity.\u201d Are APCDs worth the effort? It depends who you ask. Denise Love, director of the APCD Council, works with states to develop effective claims databases. \u201cThey are absolutely worth the money,\u201d she says. \u201cStates spend billions on health care. Spending a million or so to better manage those costs makes a lot of sense.\u201d William Kramer, who heads the Pacific Business Group on Health, which represents large employers, says states are in the best position to collect claims data from all payers. Businesses can look at their own claims data, but without complete data from all payers, they don\u2019t know who the best hospitals and doctors are. But David Newman, who directs the\u00a0Health Care Cost Institute, says pricing and quality data should not be collected in 50 separate databases.\u00a0 \u201cEvery state is using its own consultant to do it uniquely,\u201d he said. \u201cIt needs to be done using national standards so that data can be compared across states.\u201d Robert Murray, a consultant who previously directed Maryland\u2019s hospital regulatory agency, said the usefulness of a state APCD depends on how timely, accurate and complete the data are. He suggested states conduct periodic audits to check accuracy.", "card": "summary", "title": "Debating the value of an all-payer claims database - MedCity News"}, "fb": {"app_id": 148725768475669}, "google-site-verification": "xudQg7nxVR9ifmMTY4Tf-0wVtX9b6rWLQd0utCweGOc", "keywords": "weight loss, obesity, overweight,diabetes,massachusetts,medical devices,obesity,startups,healthcare innovation, medcity news,medcity news,san francisco, startups, life sciences,accelerator,rock health,startup advice,startup funding,patient monitoring system, motion sensors ,dc,healthcare it,washington,foodborne pathogens, diagnostics company, diagnostic platforms,minimally invasive surgery, laser surgery,cambridge,dealflow,hospitals,wellpoint, healthways, health and wellness, employee wellness programs,investing,wellness,medtronic, shanghai innovation center, china, r&d,china,mdt,minneapolis,minnesota,publics,twin cities,ulcerative colitis, abbott labs, humira,abbott labs,doctors,pharmaceuticals,skin disorders, pharmaceuticals, md anderson cancer center,cancer,texas,renal denervation, st. jude medical,st. jude medical,stj,emr, ehr, electronic health records, electronic medical records, certified emr,certified emr,ehr,electronic health records,electronic medical records,advanced cellular technology,amyotrophic lateral sclerosis,embryonic stem cells,geron corporation,lou gehrig\\'s disease,macular degeneration,regenerative medicine,spinal cord damage,value-based healthcare system, obamacare, fee-for-service model,california,cleveland,health insurance,insurance,ohio,pennsylvania,politics,cancer treatment options library, aetna, aet, healthcare it,aet,aetna,health it,phi,philadelphia,Big Data, health care costs, Health Data, Health insurer, obamacare, payers, , MedCity News", "article": {"section": "Convergence", "tag": "payers", "published_time": "2014-06-19T11:01:03-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-01-11T11:05:15-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,width=device-width,user-scalable=no,minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdce5d\"", "article_summary": "For example, claims data can reveal whether a doctor followed nationally recommended medical protocols for treating patients diagnosed with diabetes.\nBusinesses can look at their own claims data, but without complete data from all payers, they don\u2019t know who the best hospitals and doctors are.\nSome doctors and hospitals, however, take issue with the way claims data are presented.\nAlthough most major health care industry groups endorse the concept of so-called price transparency, some object to the use of APCDs to determine overall value.\nBut claims data show wide variation in pricing and quality of service among providers nationwide and even within the same community."}
