But when Brenda Riley looks around the cavernous 7,500-square-foot area, the sight brings a smile to her face.\n\nIn about three weeks, the building at the corner of Cushman Street and Third Avenue will be packed with oversized blocks, a brawny water table and a quirky wooly mammoth sculpture, among other colorful items.\n\nRiley, the museum\u2019s executive director, has been looking forward to it for years. The dream of a local children\u2019s museum, which began to take shape nearly a decade ago, will be realized when the museum opens on Jan. 31.\n\n\u201cThe community really sees us as valid, that we deserve to have this space,\u201d Riley said. \u201cSometimes it blows my mind that this has happened.\u201d\n\nRiley said she\u2019s loved the idea of a local children\u2019s museum since she was a girl growing up in Fairbanks.\n\nHer family used to regularly take trips to the Lower 48, packing a 1976 Ford Maverick and heading down the Alaska Highway to explore new places. They\u2019d hit a handful of kid-friendly museums along the way, and the fond memories of those trips never went away.\n\nRiley said she\u2019d come back home and wonder why the same thing wasn\u2019t available here.\n\n\u201cI always loved museums,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t know where the seed popped into my head to have a children\u2019s museum, but it\u2019s always been there.\u201d\n\nRiley found a partner in 2006, when a friend introduced her to Heather Lambert. They\u2019d both been talking separately about forming a local children\u2019s museum, and were urged to work together.\n\nNeither of them had any experience in the subject - Riley had careers in archaeology and as an optician, and Lambert is a local real estate agent. They simply bought a book on how to start a museum and went to work.\n\nWhen they began seriously pursuing the project in 2011, the pieces began falling together. Lambert, the Fairbanks Children\u2019s Museum board president, credits Riley\u2019s organizational skills and behind-the-scenes savvy for keeping the museum moving forward.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m kind of the cheerleader and she\u2019s the brains,\u201d Lambert said.\n\nIn the beginning, the Fairbanks Children\u2019s Museum began as the Museum without Walls, making a monthly appearance in various spots around town, including a car dealership, Alaska Railroad depot and the occasional store lobby. The museum\u2019s inventory was kept in Riley\u2019s garage, later shifted to a warehouse when it outgrew that space.\n\nNearly a year ago, the University of Alaska Museum of the North set aside space to give the children\u2019s museum its first full-time home. About a year ago, Riley began eyeing the Cushman Street location, which was previously home to a Woolworth\u2019s store and a telecommunications center.\n\nRiley has worked on the project with scarcely a day off for the past four years, but both she and Lambert said the museum has had remarkable good fortune. Whenever a grant or donation was needed to allow the museum to purchase equipment or take a step forward, it almost always emerged.\n\nRiley credits Rep. Scott Kawasaki for championing the museum during the last legislative session, which ended with a $166,000 state grant to relocate the museum and build it out at its current home.\n\n\u201cIt just kept happening,\u201d Lambert said. \u201cEvery time we needed something it came together. It\u2019s been an amazing experience.\u201d\n\nIt took four years for the museum to transition from a concept to a full-time installation with a permanent home. That\u2019s not a sprint in most contexts, but it\u2019s been a speedy run compared to the glacial pace most emerging museums move at.\n\nRiley said all the effort has been worth it.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s better than I imagined it could even be,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen I see the progress out there, it feels like this evolved in a nice, solid, careful path.\u201d\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Fairbanks (Alaska) Daily News-Miner, http://www.newsminer.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "At the moment, there isn't much except empty space inside the future home of the Fairbanks Children's Museum.
