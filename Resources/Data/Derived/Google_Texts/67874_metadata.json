Effective immediately coach Mike Budenholzer will take over the basketball operations department.\n\nThe Atlanta Hawks controversy took on a new life Thursday, when the Atlanta Journal-Constitution published audio of general manager Danny Ferry\u2019s conference call with other members of the team\u2019s front office. During the June 6 call, Ferry and Hawks management were discussing potential free agent targets, one of whom was Luol Deng.\n\nNow, a little background on one of the latest pro sports scandal (there are a lot these days): Hawks owner Bruce Levenson announced on Sunday that he would sell his interest in the team because of an email he wrote in 2012 that included his theory that the team\u2019s black fans kept white fans away. On Monday, Yahoo Sports\u2019 Adrian Wojnarowski reported that the email only gained noticed because the team was investigating comments made by Ferry in regards to Deng:\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s still a young guy overall. He is a good guy overall. But he is not perfect. He\u2019s got some African in him. And I don\u2019t say that in a bad way. But he\u2019s like a guy who would have a nice store out front but sell your counterfeit stuff out of the back.\u201d\n\nDeng responded:\n\nComplete Luol Deng statement pic.twitter.com/FojbVFGRO5 \u2014 Ethan J. Skolnick (@EthanJSkolnick) September 9, 2014\n\nBut then Minority owner Michael Gearon Jr. chimed in, via a letter to Levenson that was published by WSB-TV:\n\n\u201cWe believe these comments by Ferry were far worse than (Donald) Sterling\u2019s because they were not from a private personal conversation \u2014 they were in a business environment on a business matter in front of a dozen or more people. If Ferry would make such a slur in a semi-public forum, we can only imagine what he has said in smaller groups or to individuals. \u2026 Our advisors tell us there is no other choice but to ask for Ferry\u2019s resignation, and if he refuses, to terminate him for cause under his employment agreement.\u201d\n\nFerry claimed he was reading a scouting report of Deng that included the comments, and NBA commissioner Adam Silver, who received praise for banning Donald Sterling after his racist comments were made public, took a different stance with Ferry. Silver told USA TODAY Sports\u2019 Sam Amick:\n\n\u201cIn my view, those comments, taken alone, do not merit his losing his job. \u2026 It\u2019s a question of context \u2026 These words, in this context, understanding the full story here, the existence of the scouting report, the fact that he was looking at the scouting report as a reference when he was making these remarks, what I\u2019m saying is \u2013 and frankly my opinion \u2014 is that this is a team decision in terms of what the appropriate discipline is for their employee. But if I\u2019m being asked my view, I\u2019m saying that, based on what I know about the circumstances, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a terminable offense.\u201d\n\nBut this was before the AJC released the audio of the conference call. Many outside the team believe Ferry\u2019s comments were his own, and not those of a scout that he was simply reading aloud to his coworkers.\n\nStill following me?\n\nNow, since then, Ferry has obviously taken considerable heat for his comments. But those who know Ferry and have worked with him or played alongside him on the court, have offered their support. One of those people is Masai Ujiri, the former Nuggets general manager and now GM of the Toronto Raptors, who first came to know Ferry during Ujiri\u2019s days as a scout.\n\nIn an op-ed for Toronto\u2019s Globe & Mail on Thursday, Ujiri urged forgiveness for Ferry:", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Adam Silver,Atlanta Hawks,Bruce Levinson,Danny Ferry,Front Office,Luol Deng,Masai Ujiri,NBA owners", "language": "en, sv", "og": {"site_name": "Nuggets Ink", "description": "Masai Ujiri, in an op-ed for Toronto's Globe & Mail, urged forgiveness for Hawks general manager Danny Ferry for his racist comments.", "title": "Ex-Nuggets' GM Masai Ujiri pens op-ed in support of Danny Ferry", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/nuggets/2014/09/12/ex-nuggets-gm-masai-ujiri-pens-op-ed-support-danny-ferry/11505/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/nuggets/files/2014/09/161191321-495x363.jpg", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "description": "Masai Ujiri, in an op-ed for Toronto's Globe & Mail, urged forgiveness for Hawks general manager Danny Ferry for his racist comments.", "title": "UPDATED: Masai Ujiri supports Danny Ferry; Atlanta Hawks GM takes indefinite leave", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/nuggets/2014/09/12/ex-nuggets-gm-masai-ujiri-pens-op-ed-support-danny-ferry/11505/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/nuggets/files/2014/09/161191321-495x363.jpg", "creator": "@nickijhabvala", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "Masai Ujiri, in an op-ed for Toronto's Globe & Mail, urged forgiveness for Hawks general manager Danny Ferry for his racist comments."}, "article_summary": "But those who know Ferry and have worked with him or played alongside him on the court, have offered their support.\nOne of those people is Masai Ujiri, the former Nuggets general manager and now GM of the Toronto Raptors, who first came to know Ferry during Ujiri\u2019s days as a scout.\nDuring the June 6 call, Ferry and Hawks management were discussing potential free agent targets, one of whom was Luol Deng.\nMany outside the team believe Ferry\u2019s comments were his own, and not those of a scout that he was simply reading aloud to his coworkers.\nUPDATED, Sept. 12, 2:20 p.m.: | Hawks CEO Steve Koonin announced Friday that Ferry is taking an indefinite leave of absence as GM."}
