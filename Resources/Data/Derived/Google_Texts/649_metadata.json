Circuit in Washington, D.C. in a case challenging President Obama's unlawful executive orders regarding the enforcement of the Affordable Care Act, or ObamaCare. The case, American Freedom Law Center v. Obama, alleges that Obama has violated his constitutional duty to \"faithfully execute\" his signature piece of legislation approved by Congress and signed into law in 2010 -- in violation of the Constitution's separation of powers.\n\n\"What we're arguing is that by unlawful executive orders, President Obama has essentially allowed non-compliant plans to continue to exist,\" says Robert Muise, co-founder and senior counsel at AFLC. \"So those of us who have compliant plans, who are following the law as written by Congress, are now having to pay higher premiums because of the risk pools being shrunk because of these executive orders. And as a result, we have standing to challenge these unlawful orders that were issued by the president of the United States.\"\n\nBut Muise notes that all of this could be moot if the right person is elected president.\n\n\"I believe I heard Senator Ted Cruz say, 'One of my first days in office, I will rescind every one of those unlawful executive orders that was issued by President Obama.' I think the next president has an obligation to do so,\" the attorney submits, \"because now that new president will be fulfilling the responsibility under the Constitution to faithfully execute the law.\"\n\nOn that note, Muise says any president who continues to enforce these unlawful executive orders is not abiding by his or her oath of office.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.onenewsnow.com/legal-courts/2016/04/11/obama-called-out-for-not-abiding-by-his-oath-of-office", "image": {"width": 800, "identifier": "http://www.onenewsnow.com/media/5463429/gavel3_800x500.jpg", "height": 500}, "description": "A Judeo Christian law firm that fights for faith and freedom is challenging President Obama&#39;s unlawful executive orders.", "title": "Obama called out for not abiding by his oath of office"}, "twitter": {"site": "@onenewsnowcom", "image": "http://www.onenewsnow.com/media/5463429/gavel3_800x500.jpg", "description": "A Judeo Christian law firm that fights for faith and freedom is challenging President Obama&#39;s unlawful executive orders.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Obama called out for not abiding by his oath of office"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1597751183824293}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "A Judeo Christian law firm that fights for faith and freedom is challenging President Obama's unlawful executive orders."}, "article_summary": "On that note, Muise says any president who continues to enforce these unlawful executive orders is not abiding by his or her oath of office.\nThe American Freedom Law Center (AFLC) recently argued before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C.\nCircuit in Washington, D.C. in a case challenging President Obama's unlawful executive orders regarding the enforcement of the Affordable Care Act, or ObamaCare.\n\"I believe I heard Senator Ted Cruz say, 'One of my first days in office, I will rescind every one of those unlawful executive orders that was issued by President Obama.'\nA Judeo Christian law firm that fights for faith and freedom is challenging President Obama's unlawful executive orders."}
