John Kasich running a Republican presidential campaign or an Obamacare promotional tour?\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to tell, because Kasich is still pitching billions in Obamacare Medicaid expansion spending \u2014 for working-age adults who aren\u2019t disabled and don\u2019t have kids \u2014 as common sense conservatism.\n\n\u201cWhile traveling to other states, the governor spends a lot of time being Obamacare\u2019s chief lobbyist,\u201d Tarren Bragdon, president and CEO of the free-market Foundation for Government Accountability, told Watchdog.org.\n\nMontana lawmakers enacted Obamacare\u2019s Medicaid expansion after Kasich slammed Republican critics during a January campaign stop, and Kasich repeated many of the same talking points in Georgia on Tuesday.\n\nRELATED: Obama wishes more Republicans were like Ohio\u2019s Kasich\n\nGeorgia is one of 21 states saving federal taxpayers billions by rejecting Obamacare\u2019s Medicaid expansion.\n\n\u201cWhen Governor Kasich brings his Washington talk to Georgia, conservatives are not impressed,\u201d State Rep. Jason Spencer, one of the Georgia General Assembly\u2019s foremost Obamacare opponents, told Watchdog.org.\n\nSpencer said Kasich, who served in Congress from 1983-01, may be able to draw a crowd of political insiders but will have trouble connecting with primary voters.\n\n\u201cThe conservative base in Georgia is not impressed with Medicaid expansion,\u201d Spencer said. \u201cWe know that\u2019s Obamacare, and Governor Kasich has a lot of work to do in Georgia.\u201d\n\nAlthough Kasich\u2019s Obamacare expansion has already cost federal taxpayers over $3 billion, he keeps trying to thread a welfare spending needle he insists has nothing to do with Obamacare.\n\nRELATED: Ohio Gov. Kasich\u2019s Obamacare support wins left-wing praise\n\nOhio\u2019s Obamacare expansion is paid for with \u201cOhio money\u201d Kasich is \u201cbringing back\u201d to the state, he told the Fulton County Republican Party in Georgia on Tuesday.\n\nWhile campaigning in South Carolina on Wednesday, Kasich told CNN host Jake Tapper the same during a contentious TV interview.\n\n\u201cThe governor\u2019s wrong,\u201d Bragdon told Watchdog.org. \u201cThis isn\u2019t money the people of Ohio have paid in taxes that he\u2019s simply going back to Washington to retrieve.\u201d\n\n\u201cObamacare robs from the Medicare promise for Ohio seniors and those with disabilities to pay for Medicaid expansion,\u201d Bragdon continued.\n\n\u201cGovernor Kasich is going along with that by justifying $20 billion in Medicare cuts to Ohio seniors and folks with disabilities to fund a brand new welfare benefit to folks who have never gotten welfare benefits before.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not just Bragdon and Spencer who dispute Kasich\u2019s take on paying for Obamacare expansion. Kasich\u2019s claims have been refuted by the Congressional Research Service and the Congressional Budget Office.\n\nCRS and CBO are nonpartisan agencies advising Congress on federal policy \u2014 and Kasich\u2019s conflicting position isn\u2019t even supported by Obamacare advocates in his own state.\n\nThe governor\u2019s press secretary did not respond to a request for comment.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Is Ohio Gov.
