Friday, officers of the Marianna Police Department responded to an armed robbery in progress call at the Subway Restaurant on Lafayette Street.

The caller was the manager, Brandy Noel Gramling, of Cottondale. Gramling reports that she had just been robbed by an unknown black male suspect with a gun. She adds that the suspect shut her in the walk-in freezer.

When police arrived, Gramling was found in the freezer, unharmed.

While telling her story to investigators, police noticed some inconsistencies between Gramlingâ€™s version of events and what was on security video. Police also say there was no suspect in the video committing armed robbery, but the video did show Gramling taking the money and hiding it. It also showed Gramling opening the back door and then closing herself in the walk-in freezer.

Gramling told police after she was arrested, that she made the whole story of an armed robbery up to cover the theft.

Investigators found all the missing money. Gramling was transported to the Jackson County Correction Facility to await first appearance. Brandy Noel Gramling is charged with two felonies, False Report Felony to Law Enforcement and Grand Theft.
