Ron Hubbard, who \u201conce said the only way to make any real money in this world was to start a religion.\u201d While there are only about 30,000 Scientologists, the comic added, \u201cit owns billions in real estate tax-scot-free.\u201d\n\nSince the Supreme Court last took up a case about taxing religious organizations in 1970, Maher added, more Americans have abandoned organized faith.\n\n\u201cThe atheists, agnostics and anti-religionists are now the second-biggest denomination in America, right behind evangelicals. We\u2019re 22.8 percent,\u201d he said. \u201cThat means almost a quarter of us in America are being forced to subsidize a myth that we\u2019re not buying into.\u201d\n\nMaher, who wrote and produced the pro-atheism documentary \u201cReligulous,\u201d dismissed religion as a \u201csexist, homophobic magic act that\u2019s been used to justify everything from genital mutilation to genocide.\u201d\n\nWatch the full video above.\n\nTed Cruz v Donald Trump Timeline: Their Insults About Wives and Rat Sex (Photos) This week began with nude pictures of Donald Trump's wife, Melania Trump, and ended with Ted Cruz calling Trump a rat and just barely avoiding the word \"ratfucking.\" Let's review. Getty Images\n\nIt all started with an anti-Trump Facebook ad targeted at Mormons from the super PAC America Awesome, which featured a photo of Melania Trump posing naked for GQ. Getty Images\n\nTaking offense to the perceived slight, Trump threatened to \"spill the beans\" on Cruz's wife Heidi. \"Be careful, Lyin' Ted,\" he warned on Twitter. \"Pic of your wife not from us. Donald, if you try to attack Heidi, you're more of a coward than I thought. #classless,\" responded Cruz. Getty Images\n\nOn Wednesday, a story accusing Cruz of having affairs with five women appeared in The National Enquirer. Cruz denied the story, calling it \"complete and utter lies\" and \"a smear that has come from Donald Trump and his henchmen.\" Getty Images\n\nWhile accusing Trump of planting the story, Cruz tried to talk around the word \"ratfucking,\" derogatory slang for an especially dirty kind of political sabotage. \u201cHe\u2019s a man for whom a term was coined for copulating with a rodent,\u201d Cruz said of a former Trump ally. \u201cWell let me be clear, Mr. Trump may be a rat but I have no desire to copulate with him. And this garbage does not belong in politics.\u201d Getty Images\n\nOn Friday, Trump issued a statement on Facebook, denying the accusation that he planted the Enquirer story. \"While [The National Enquirer was] right about O.J. Simpson, John Edwards, and many others, I certainly hope they are not right about Lyin\u2019 Ted Cruz,\" he wrote.
