In comparison, 27 percent are predicting that the largest increase will occur in 2018, the year the Cadillac tax goes into effect.\n\nThe impending Cadillac tax was cited by 20 percent of respondents as the main reason costs are expected to increase, followed by general administrative costs (19 percent) and costs associated with reporting, disclosure, and notification requirements (13 percent).\n\n\u201cEmployers need to devote significant time and energy to maintain compliance with the law,\u201d Julie Stich, CEBS, director of research at the IFEBP, said in a written statement. \u201cThe extensive amounts of data that employers are required to collect can take hours of manpower and even require complex IT infrastructures. The process has meant a cost increase for many, especially smaller organizations.\u201d\n\nThe term \u201cCadillac tax\u201d is used to describe high-cost health insurance plans with top-of-the-line benefits. Under Obamacare, employers will be required to pay an excise tax on a plan costing more than $10,200 for an individual or $27,500 for a family. The tax is equal to 40 percent of the cost of premiums above these thresholds. The Cadillac plan thresholds will be indexed for inflation after 2018.\n\nTrending {{item['sft-title']}}\n\nWith the change for Cadillac plans looming in a few years, the vast majority of the employers surveyed \u2013 71 percent, to be exact \u2013 believe that the worst is yet to come. But the healthcare law is already having an impact. The IFEBP says 82 percent of employers expect their costs to go up this year, ranging from about 1 percent to 6 percent higher.\n\n\u201cInterestingly, we have seen a trend of employers continually anticipating the worst, where each upcoming year looms with the largest costs. In 2014, the majority felt 2015 would bring the largest costs. In 2015, 2016 seems to be the worst,\u201d commented Stich.\n\nWhat are employers doing to control costs? According to the survey, a significant number are relying on high-deductible health plans (HDHPs) to help stem the tide. Forty-two percent say they have or are considering an HDHP with a health savings account, 13 percent have an HDHP with a health reimbursement arrangement, and 11 percent have an HDHP with no account. Almost one out of every 10 employers have adopted a full-replacement HDHP in the wake of Obamacare, and 19 percent more are contemplating this move.\n\nOne wild card in the scenario is the outcome of a case currently being reviewed by the US Supreme Court. In King v. Burwell, the key issue presented is whether the health insurance marketplace can grant premium tax credits under Obamacare. Without the credits, millions of taxpayers can\u2019t afford health insurance, posing a major threat to the law\u2019s survival. The nation\u2019s top court is expected to hand down its ruling in June.", "article_metadata": {"foaf": {"name": "Ken Berry"}, "dcterms.title": "\u2018Cadillac Tax\u2019 is Expected to Drive Up Healthcare Costs, Survey Finds", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "rdfs": {"label skos": {"prefLabel": "Practice Excellence"}}, "og": {"site_name": "AccountingWEB", "title": "\u2018Cadillac Tax\u2019 is Expected to Drive Up Healthcare Costs, Survey Finds", "url": "http://www.accountingweb.com/practice/practice-excellence/cadillac-tax-is-expected-to-drive-up-healthcare-costs-survey-finds", "image": "http://www.accountingweb.com/sites/default/files/styles/media_medium/public/money-doctor-medical-expense_0.png?itok=BfmifE37", "updated_time": "2015-05-21T13:30:00+00:00", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.accountingweb.com/practice/practice-excellence/cadillac-tax-is-expected-to-drive-up-healthcare-costs-survey-finds", "card": "summary", "title": "\u2018Cadillac Tax\u2019 is Expected to Drive Up Healthcare Costs, Survey Finds"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#dce6eb", "dcterms.identifier": "http://www.accountingweb.com/practice/practice-excellence/cadillac-tax-is-expected-to-drive-up-healthcare-costs-survey-finds", "dcterms.creator": "Ken Berry", "dcterms.date": "2015-05-21T13:30+00:00", "dcterms.language": "und", "msapplication-TileImage": "/sites/all/themes/awus/favicon-152.png", "dcterms.type": "Text", "sift": {"targeting": "[{\"key\":\"tag\",\"value\":[\"Affordable Care Act\",\"Government\"]},{\"key\":\"type\",\"value\":\"Article\"},{\"key\":\"subtopic\",\"value\":\"Practice Excellence\"},{\"key\":\"topic\",\"value\":[\"Practice Excellence\",\"Practice\"]},{\"key\":\"url\",\"value\":\"node_19561\"},{\"key\":\"status\",\"value\":\"live\"},{\"key\":\"homepage\",\"value\":\"0\"},{\"key\":\"user\",\"value\":\"out\"},{\"key\":\"CxSegments\",\"value\":\"\"}]"}, "article": {"published_time": "2015-05-21T15:30:12+01:00", "modified_time": "2015-07-03T16:26:51+01:00"}, "cXenseParse": {"sft-section": "Practice Excellence", "sft-tag": "Government", "sft-date": "May 21st 2015", "sft-type": "Article", "sft-topic": "Practice", "recs": {"category": "Article", "articleid": "node-19561", "publishtime": "2015-05-21T15:30:12:000Z"}, "sft-author": "Ken Berry", "sft-title": "Healthcare Costs Could Surge Due to 'Cadillac Tax'"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc5cb\"", "article_summary": "In comparison, 27 percent are predicting that the largest increase will occur in 2018, the year the Cadillac tax goes into effect.\nAccording to the survey, a significant number are relying on high-deductible health plans (HDHPs) to help stem the tide.\nThe study points to the so-called Cadillac tax as the \u201cdriving force\u201d behind the increase.\nWithout the credits, millions of taxpayers can\u2019t afford health insurance, posing a major threat to the law\u2019s survival.\nThe impending Cadillac tax was cited by 20 percent of respondents as the main reason costs are expected to increase, followed by general administrative costs (19 percent) and costs associated with reporting, disclosure, and notification requirements (13 percent)."}
