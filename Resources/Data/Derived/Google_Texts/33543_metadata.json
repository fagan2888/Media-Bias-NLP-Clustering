This was preceded by Frontier\u2019s April 2014 transition to an ultra-low-cost carrier model, characterized by stripped-down economy fare tickets and a la carte service offerings.\n\n\u201cSure, they are our hometown carrier and they have stopped hubbing through here \u2026 but we\u2019ve seen other airlines in the past few months add capacity,\u201d Day said Sunday, citing Spirit, American and Southwest as examples. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be an impact, but the good news for our passengers is we are financially really sound and ready for anything that happens.\u201d\n\nDespite Frontier\u2019s recent decisions, Day is focused on keeping the wheels turning at the airport. DIA plays host this week for more than 600 delegates from around the globe for the eighth annual Routes Americas conference, where airport officials plan to meet with representatives from at least 30 airlines and attempt to woo them into serving the Mile High City.\n\nRoutes Americas is part of the larger Routes global aviation conference network focusing on commercial aviation services, tourism and travel accessibility throughout North, Central and South America and the Caribbean. The conference, which runs through Tuesday, gathers representatives from 275 airports and more than 80 airlines for three days of networking and planning that\u2019s been characterized by DIA officials as \u201cspeed dating for airlines.\u201d\n\nServing as host for Routes Americas\u2019 first U.S. conference gives DIA a home-field advantage because delegates will get to experience the city\u2019s hospitality firsthand, including an \u201cAmerican football-themed\u201d party at Sports Authority Field at Mile High for the Super Bowl.\n\nDay said the airport\u2019s focus over the next two days is on landing more direct international flights \u2014 especially since DIA is in its 31st straight month of international travel growth \u2014 and is looking especially hard at carriers like Turkish Airlines and China Southern Airlines, which serve the key markets of the Middle East and Asia.\n\nIn addition to Denver\u2019s strong economy and a young, educated workforce, the people here readily jump on board for new experiences, Day said, which all combines to make the city quite attractive to airlines.\n\n\u201cWe have this population that loves to fly and embraces anything. No one in this community could spell Reykjav\u00edk five years ago, and now they\u2019re doing house swaps. That\u2019s what our passengers love \u2014 give them a new place to go and they\u2019ll embrace it,\u201d she said.\n\nSeveral airlines at DIA have recently experienced growth. The airport serves as Southwest\u2019s fastest-growing market, and United Airlines has added flights, including direct flights to Tokyo and Panama City.\n\nThis growth contributed to Frontier Airlines\u2019 recent decisions, president Barry Biffle said Sunday. And, while Frontier isn\u2019t turning its back on Denver, it makes no sense to concentrate 90 percent of the airline in a \u201cbelow-average market\u201d at an \u201cover capacity\u201d airport heavily serviced by Southwest and United, Biffle said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re looking for growth opportunities outside of Denver,\u201d he said. \u201cDenver\u2019s a great city, and we\u2019re based here and we believe we can export that Rocky Mountain hospitality to other markets, but on a fundamental basis, the fares in Denver are lower than average.\n\n\u201cTwo-thirds of the U.S. market is very attractive to us at this point, and it\u2019s a really good time to be in this business.\u201d\n\nAlthough complaints about the airline\u2019s new structure have increased, Biffle feels Frontier is on the right track as \u201cone of the few in the world that have pulled off\u201d a successful transition to the ULCC model. Besides, he said, it comes to each traveler\u2019s decision on how much they want to pay for perks.\n\n\u201cEverybody wants them, but are they willing to pay for it,\u201d he said. \u201cWe think we can keep a lot of goodwill with our customers.\u201d\n\nLaura Keeney: 303-954-1337, lkeeney@denverpost.com or twitter.com/LauraKeeney", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "DIA pursues international flights at Routes conference", "title": "DIA pursues international flights at Routes conference", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/02/01/dia-pursues-international-flights-at-routes-conference/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150201__20150202_A2_CD02AIRPORTp1.jpg", "height": 428}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150201__20150202_A2_CD02AIRPORTp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-02-01T18:12:22+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-24T20:59:41+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcbd34\"", "article_summary": "While Denver-based Frontier Airlines may be pulling away from Denver International Airport as a hub, airport CEO Kim Day remains unfazed about the airport\u2019s future.\nThe airport serves as Southwest\u2019s fastest-growing market, and United Airlines has added flights, including direct flights to Tokyo and Panama City.\nThis growth contributed to Frontier Airlines\u2019 recent decisions, president Barry Biffle said Sunday.\nRoutes Americas is part of the larger Routes global aviation conference network focusing on commercial aviation services, tourism and travel accessibility throughout North, Central and South America and the Caribbean.\nFrontier has eliminated many routes nationwide, including several at DIA, and earlier this month announced plans to outsource 1,160 Denver jobs in a move the airline says is necessary to stay competitive."}
