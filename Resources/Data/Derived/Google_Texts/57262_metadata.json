It\u2019s propaganda. And frankly, I\u2019m sick of it.\u201d\n\nThat is what Carly Fiorina, the former Chairman and CEO of Hewlett-Packard and 2010 candidate for the U.S. Senate in California, had to say about the Democrats\u2019 so called war on women in an interview with TheIowaRepublican.com on Monday.\n\nFiorina admits that the gap between women voting for Republican candidates and those voting for Democratic candidates remains too large, but she\u2019s hoping her latest political endeavor can help narrow the gap which might help swing control of the U.S. Senate back to Republicans for the first time since 2006.\n\nFiorina\u2019s Unlocking Potential Project, or \u201cUP\u201d for short, is focused on six states, Iowa, Colorado, Michigan, New Hampshire, North Carolina, and Virginia. While the aim of the group is focused on helping the Republicans get better organized, utilize new technology, and better message to female voters, the group is focused on more than just helping elect female candidates like Iowa\u2019s Joni Ernst to the U.S. Senate.\n\n\u201cOur workshops, our activities, our events are open to men and women. If you look at the states we are playing in, what you will see is that there are a whole verity of matchups,\u201d Fiorina explained. For example, in Colorado, the group will engage voters in a race between two male candidates, while in Iowa the race is between a female Republican and a male Democrat candidate. The group is also active in New Hampshire were the Republican nominee will be a male running against a female incumbent.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really not about the gender of the candidate,\u201d Fiorina said, \u201cIt\u2019s really about the nature of the issues. It\u2019s about how we talk about issues and how we make sure that we don\u2019t continue to insult women as the Democrats are by suggesting they only care about abortion or birth control.\u201d\n\nFiorina also was quick to point out the fallacy in the Democrats\u2019 was on women. \u201cThe reality is that women don\u2019t lack access to abortion and birth control, they lack access to opportunity.\u201d She went on to say that, \u201cUnder this administration, women lack access to their doctor and healthcare thanks to Obamacare.\u201d\n\nFiorina admitted that the Democrats\u2019 war on women messaging has been successful because they make the claim with such insistence. She believes that it can be persuasive for Republican women to stand up and say that conservative policies are better for women. \u201cIt\u2019s Democratic policies that hurt women, and the facts clearly support those statements,\u201d Fiorina stated.\n\nFiorina believes that women are most influenced by other women they know. \u201cWe know that every issue is a women\u2019s issue,\u201d she stated. \u201cThat\u2019s contrary to the Democrat propaganda that women care far more about reproductive rights [than anything else].\u201d Fiorina believes that if Republicans equip women to push back hard on the war on women, they will have a persuasive argument and make a difference this November. The Unlocking Potential Project is attempting to unlock the potential of women in the political process, women as voters, and as persuaders in a way that hasn\u2019t been done before.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about activating women,\u201d Fiorina told TheIowaRepublican.com. \u201cSpecifically, what we want women to do is reach out to those women who are Republican leaning or occasional voters. Or reach out to independent women who are persuadable and talk with them about the issues.\u201d\n\nWith Joni Ernst in a tight race against Democrat Congressman Bruce Braley, the group\u2019s efforts could work well in Iowa where there hasn\u2019t been an open U.S. Senate seat in forty years. Fiorina raved about the Republican nominee, stating, \u201cJoni Ernst is precisely the kind of person that Iowans should want to represent them because she has seen life from [somewhere] other than Capital Hill \u2013 because she has served in so many ways.\u201d\n\nFiorina also believes that it\u2019s important to not to give Braley a pass because the Democratic machine is going to gear up to defend him by hurling ridiculous charges against Joni Ernst. \u201cWhy are they doing that?\u201d Fiorina asked rhetorically, \u201cBecause it\u2019s all they have.\u201d\n\n\u201cEverything [the Democrats] are putting in their ads is either false or irrelevant,\u201d Fiorina said. \u201cBut they can\u2019t run against her record, so what do they do? They throw all this stuff at her. It\u2019s propaganda. It\u2019s scare tactics.\u201d Fiorina pointed out that Braley and the Democrats have already attempted to use their war on women messaging against Ernst. \u201cIt\u2019s ridiculous,\u201d Fiorina said, \u201cBut they are going to keep doing it because, in the past, it\u2019s worked.\u201d\n\nUnlike other groups that are attempting to influence the 2014 election by running television ads, Fiorina\u2019s group is taking a different approach. \u201cIt\u2019s not me coming in and telling these folks what to do. It\u2019s me, our state director, and others, galvanizing resources and providing tools and training so that women who live here can talk to other women they know,\u201d said Fiorina.\n\n\u201cWe [Republicans] are under invested in the ground game and have been for sometime,\u201d she admitted. \u201cAnd yes, this is influenced in part by me having been a candidate before because the people on the ground matter. In the end, it\u2019s all about who shows up to vote, said Fiorina. \u201cWhile the air wars are important, in the end the most important thing is that people show up and vote,\u201d she added.\n\n\u201cThe choice is very clear,\u201d Fiorina said of Ernst, \u201cbut we need to make sure that Iowans can see past all the propaganda and look at these two individuals for who they are and what they have done.\u201d Fiorina believes that if Iowans are allowed the opportunity to decide between the two candidates on their merit, Republican Joni Ernst will be end up being the clear favorite.\n\nCarly Fiorina is no stranger to high-profile races for the United States Senate. The former Chairman and CEO of Hewlett-Packard put her own name on the ballot in 2010 in her home state of California.\n\nFiorina wasn\u2019t expected to defeat Sen. Barbara Boxer, one of the most entrenched liberals to have ever served in the U.S. Senate, but Fiorina campaigned hard, trumpeting her conservative philosophy despite campaigning in the bluest of blue states.\n\nThat year, Fiorina received more votes than any other Republican on the ballot across the country. Unfortunately, it wasn\u2019t enough to defeat Sen. Boxer, but the loss didn\u2019t sour Fiorina on politics. In fact, she\u2019s more involved in Republican politics than ever before.\n\nThe Unlocking Potential Project is designed to assist the Republican campaign effort in areas where they typically struggle, like technology, grassroots organization, and engaging female voters. The organization\u2019s website says its goal is to, \u201cput boots on the ground and connect with women on a personal level.\u201d Fiorina and her group are heading to Iowa and will hold a workshop designed to equip Republicans, men and women alike, to best support candidates like Joni Ernst and others on the ballot this fall.", "article_metadata": {}, "article_summary": "She believes that it can be persuasive for Republican women to stand up and say that conservative policies are better for women.\n\u201cIt\u2019s about activating women,\u201d Fiorina told TheIowaRepublican.com.\nIt\u2019s scare tactics.\u201d Fiorina pointed out that Braley and the Democrats have already attempted to use their war on women messaging against Ernst.\nFiorina\u2019s Unlocking Potential Project, or \u201cUP\u201d for short, is focused on six states, Iowa, Colorado, Michigan, New Hampshire, North Carolina, and Virginia.\n\u201cSpecifically, what we want women to do is reach out to those women who are Republican leaning or occasional voters."}
