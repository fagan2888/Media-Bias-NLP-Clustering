President Obama’s reading mean tweets on "Kimmel" and the first lady is dancing on "Ellen," so what’s Joe Biden up to?

Apparently, doing millions of arm curls.

On Friday, the White House released a new Vine video featuring the veep. He’s lifting a 30-pound dumbbell while chatting on the phone. The video is part of the #GimmeFive challenge that Michelle Obama announced last month.

“I want kids, parents, maybe even a few celebrities to give me five ways to be healthy,” the first lady said in a video. The challenge also marks the fifth year of her signature program, Let’s Move.
