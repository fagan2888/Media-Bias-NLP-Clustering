Anyone seen any new cultural offerings from the Right?\u201d\n\nGeraghty, though a contributing editor at National Review since 2004 and very much a part of the movement he gently upbraided, nonetheless faulted the movement\u2019s neglect of American culture. Because of this neglect, liberalism forms the cultural background of most elections. If this does not change, he and others have argued, victory will continue to elude conservatives.\n\nAt some point, Geraghty decided to answer his own call with The Weed Agency: A Comic Tale of Bureaucracy Without Limits. His first novel, the book centers on \u201c[t]he gargantuan, ever-growing, ever-less-accountable, impossible-to-uproot federal bureaucracy.\u201d Geraghty believes this to be \u201cthe sleeper issue of our time,\u201d as the bureaucracy\u2019s intrusiveness, unresponsiveness, and inefficiency angers conservatives, frustrates liberals, and chastens idealistic youth.\n\nThe book traces the life of the Agency of Invasive Species (a fictional division of the Department of Agriculture) from its Carter-era inception to the present day. Though Geraghty admits that this agency does not exist, several similar agencies do. Geraghty aims for an instructive mix of fact and fiction, bolstered at times by the unusual but helpful use of citations for some seemingly outrageous devices and allusions.\n\nGeraghty hardly beats readers over the head with polemics. His easygoing, breezy style translates into eminently readable fiction. He gives us real characters, for example, who convincingly advance his narrative: Adam Humphrey, the weed agency\u2019s head, a calculating master of bureaucratic inertia who nonetheless genuinely cares for his subordinates; Jack Wilkins, Humphrey\u2019s prot\u00e9g\u00e9; Nicholas Bader, a Republican congressman with a bitter vendetta against Humphrey stemming from his own failed attempt to eliminate the weed agency during the Reagan years; and Lisa Bloom, Jamie Caro, and Ava Summers, a trio of young professionals who enter the agency in 1993. Each character gets a full arc.\n\nTwo additional qualities elevate \u201cThe Weed Agency\u201d above other political fiction. The first is Geraghty\u2019s eye for detail. As a stylist, he is adequate; as a humorist, he is superb. Telling minutiae pack the book\u2019s pages, rewarding both the casual and the careful reader. Some, like references to the Wall Street Journal\u2019s affinity for pointillist art, and the recent popularity of the single em-dash in vapid news articles (\u201c\u2026government workers who keep the wheels of government turning are brave, righteous, dashing\u2014and yes, even stylish.\u201d), reveal themselves more readily than others.\n\nYet even the more veiled references\u2014the momentary fear of a Vietnamese immigrant when he mistakes an overheard \u201cVC\u201d for \u201cVietcong\u201d instead of the intended \u201cventure capitalist,\u2019 Weyland-Yutani and Oceanic Airlines, two famous fictional corporations, being clients of a consulting firm\u2014also provide rewarding chuckles to the initiated.\n\nGeraghty has a knack for capturing the conservative perspective of Washington\u2019s recent past. Ambitious Reaganites compromise and prioritize away their small-government zeal. D.C. obsesses over sexual harassment and similar matters during the Lewinsky scandal. Gingrich revolution and Bush-era Republicans morph into unprincipled hacks. Geraghty enlivens this big history not only with his own characters, but with funny-but-true cameo-caricatures of real politicians: Al Gore\u2019s robotic personality; Newt Gingrich\u2019s frenetic futurist/historian; Bobby Jindal\u2019s garrulous genius.\n\nOccasionally, one encounters a narrative thread\u2014like one character\u2019s foray into Silicon Valley, or a rebar-swordfight atop an unfinished building\u2014whose purpose may seem uncertain. But even these require little patience of the reader, as Geraghty delivers the payoff quickly. It all adds up to a humorous and depressing look at Washington that makes a great case against bureaucracy, delivered by someone who clearly knows his subject matter.\n\nJim Geraghty has, in short, crafted a work of fiction so accessible and entertaining that it could advance conservatism culturally. Let\u2019s hope that it does, that Geraghty\u2019s efforts inspire others to do the same, and that this isn\u2019t his last venture into the weeds of fiction writing.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Jim Geraghty\u2019s fictional debut is worth a read", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Free Beacon", "description": "In the wake of the 2012 election, as conservatives sought a return to electoral success, Jim Geraghty lightly chastised them. \u201cHey, remember how everybody on the right decided after the excruciating", "title": "\u2018The Weed Agency\u2019 Review", "url": "http://freebeacon.com/culture/the-weed-agency-review/", "image": "http://freebeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Capitol-dusk-150x150.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://freebeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Capitol-dusk-150x150.jpg", "title": "\u2018The Weed Agency\u2019 Review", "site": "@freebeacon", "card": "summary", "description": "In the wake of the 2012 election, as conservatives sought a return to electoral success, Jim Geraght"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1047859882", "fb": {"app_id": "FB_APP_ID"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fddb5d\"", "article_summary": "At some point, Geraghty decided to answer his own call with The Weed Agency: A Comic Tale of Bureaucracy Without Limits.\nTwo additional qualities elevate \u201cThe Weed Agency\u201d above other political fiction.\nThough Geraghty admits that this agency does not exist, several similar agencies do.\nThe book traces the life of the Agency of Invasive Species (a fictional division of the Department of Agriculture) from its Carter-era inception to the present day.\nJim Geraghty has, in short, crafted a work of fiction so accessible and entertaining that it could advance conservatism culturally."}
