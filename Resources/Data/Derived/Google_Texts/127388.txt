A lion bit and scratched a Dallas Zoo keeper on Saturday during a routine transfer of the lions in the off-exhibit lion house.

The 35-year-old zookeeper didn’t secure a door allowing the female lion into the same enclosed space as him. The keeper was injured while attempting to escape and used pepper spray as a last resort, said spokeswoman Laurie Holloway.

The keeper is being treated at an area hospital for a bite on the back of his shoulder and scratches on his chest. The injuries are not thought to be life-threatening.

A second keeper was behind a separate set of locked doors and helped distract the lion while the other keeper got away.

“One of our experienced keepers made a mistake by not following procedures, and that will be addressed,” said Gregg Hudson, president and chief executive officer of the Dallas Zoo in a prepared statement. “We have detailed protocols and procedures in place, but unfortunately, when humans are involved, mistakes can occur. We are thankful that there wasn’t a more serious injury.”

The lion was sedated and moved to a secure area. She will not be punished or euthanized as she was “simply being a wild animal” and will return to the exhibit with the three other lions, Holloway said.

Guests were not in danger, but were temporarily ushered out of area near the lion habitat, Holloway said.

The lion habitat will be open Sunday.

The incident is the first problem reported involving the zoo’s lions since November 2013, when a male lion killed a 5-year-old lioness in full view of visitors.
