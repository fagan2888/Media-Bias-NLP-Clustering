Gravie and Stride Health hope to duplicate that success in health insurance shopping.\n\n\n\nThe exchanges are not necessarily easy for consumers to use, found a team of researchers from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation that navigated HealthCare.gov and state-based exchanges during the beginning of the open-enrollment period, for example.\n\n\n\nExchanges don't typically estimate costs of different plans for consumers, or provide integrated tools to search for in-network providers, they noted.\n\n\n\nAnd consumers get confused about what they're buying. For example, a Commonwealth Fund survey conducted from April to June this year found that nearly 40% of consumers don't know what doctors are in their network.\n\n\n\nFor Stride Health CEO Noah Lang, the problem isn't just how exchanges present information, it's also the way healthcare presents information overall. \u201cI'm really big on the vocabulary in this space. The word 'quote' is one I'd like to eradicate,\u201d he said, citing one example of healthcare jargon that, cumulatively, confuses consumers. \u201cA price is a price.\u201d\n\n\n\nLang's company is building a recommendation engine for consumers based around key questions they ask.\n\n\n\n\u201cThey want to know what the most affordable option is for them,\u201d he explained. \u201cThey want to know if they can keep their doctor, or whether they can see a good one. And they want to know what their doctors and drugs are going to cost,\u201d he said. \u201cIt's hard to answer those questions\u2014unless you build an engine that gives personalized answers to everyone.\u201d\n\n\n\nStride Health aggregates information such as historical claims, doctor networks, drug formularies, real-time drug pricing data and self-reported consumer data to arrive at individual recommendations for consumers shopping for insurance on an exchange.\n\n\n\nIt also can take personal factors, such as what drugs or conditions someone might have, and estimate costs based on patients with a similar profile.\n\n\n\nStride Health markets direct-to-consumer and has partnered with some so-called sharing economy firms, such as ride-sharing firm Uber, that use independent contractors as their workforce. Should it make a successful recommendation, it earns a commission, like a traditional broker.\n\n\n\nGravie targets small and midsize businesses, pitching the idea that their employees can get cheaper insurance\u2014and have more options\u2014if they go through Gravie's marketplace. About 30% of its clientele are individuals \u201coff the street\u201d, said CEO Abir Sen.\n\n\n\nGravie also helps customers manage their health experience. A consumer with a high-deductible health plan, for example, would be able to manage a health spending account and have options for telehealth through the firm's website.\n\n\n\n\u201cIf you run into trouble, your claim gets denied, we can help you sort that out. If you got a bill from a hospital that doesn't make sense, we can make sense of it,\u201d Sen said.\n\n\n\nOne of the features on the firm's app is called, \u201cIs it covered?\u201d It allows consumers to ask whether a given procedure or provider is covered by their particular insurance plans. If a consumer keeps asking questions and being told \u201cno,\u201d Sen said, the firm might mention during a subsequent enrollment period that there's a plan whose premium costs $40 more per month, but covers all the services the customer has been looking for.\n\n\n\nLike Stride, Gravie makes money as a broker. Gravie raised a reported $10.5 million earlier this year.\n\nRelated content", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#0a365e", "description": "Health tech startups Gravie and Stride Health, each with a slightly different business model, see money to be made in helping consumers navigate the often non-consumer-friendly new world of online health insurance exchanges.", "title": "Startups help consumers navigate inWsurance exchanges", "og": {"site_name": "Modern Healthcare", "description": "Health tech startups Gravie and Stride Health, each with a slightly different business model, see money to be made in helping consumers navigate the often non-consumer-friendly new world of online health insurance exchanges.", "title": "Startups help consumers navigate inWsurance exchanges", "url": "http://www.modernhealthcare.com/article/20141222/NEWS/312229958", "image": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/modernhealthcare/mh-logo/master/mh-logo-fb-lg.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "http://www.modernhealthcare.com", "description": "Health tech startups Gravie and Stride Health, each with a slightly different business model, see money to be made in helping consumers navigate the often non-consumer-friendly new world of online health insurance exchanges.", "title": "Startups help consumers navigate inWsurance exchanges", "image": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/modernhealthcare/mh-logo/master/mh-logo-twitter.jpg", "creator": "@modrnhealthcr", "site": "@modrnhealthcr", "card": "summary"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Modern Healthcare", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "url": "http://www.modernhealthcare.com/article/20141222/NEWS/312229958", "published_at": "2014-12-22", "msapplication-TileImage": "https:/raw.githubusercontent.com/modernhealthcare/mh-logo/master/ms-touch-icon-144x144-precomposed.png", "mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "image": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/modernhealthcare/mh-logo/master/mh-logo-g-plus.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda724\"", "article_summary": "Gravie and Stride Health hope to duplicate that success in health insurance shopping.\nFor Stride Health CEO Noah Lang, the problem isn't just how exchanges present information, it's also the way healthcare presents information overall.\nLike Stride, Gravie makes money as a broker.\nHealth tech startups Gravie and Stride Health, each with a slightly different business model, see money to be made in helping consumers navigate the often non-consumer-friendly new world of online health insurance exchanges.\nStride Health markets direct-to-consumer and has partnered with some so-called sharing economy firms, such as ride-sharing firm Uber, that use independent contractors as their workforce."}
