R. Kraus, 22, directs traffic in 1940 on the Louisville side of the Louisville Municipal/Clark Bridge going to Jeffersonville. Aug., 23, 1940, The Courier-Journal (Photo: The Courier-Journal archives)Buy Photo\n\nHugh Cochran, driving a classic 1940s black sedan, clasped his hands over his head in a celebratory handshake in November 1946 as he became the first person to cross the Louisville Municipal/Clark Memorial Bridge for free between Louisville and Jeffersonville, Ind.\n\nTolls had been removed the day before -- considered an obstruction to \"free trade\" between the two areas -- and The Courier-Journal photo recording the scene showed the difference a day makes.\n\nThe Clark Bridge, just west of I-65, remains free, along with the Sherman Minton Bridge/I-64 to New Albany, but tolls are making a comeback in the area -- and are expected to start later this year on other bridges to help pay for the Ohio River Bridges Project.\n\nThis time, an all-electronic tolling system called RiverLInk will be instituted on the new Abraham Lincoln Bridge, which will carry six lanes of I-65 traffic northbound from downtown Louisville; the improved Kennedy Bridge, which will carry six lanes of southbound traffic; and the new East End bridge, which will connect the Gene Snyder Freeway (I-265) in Prospect with the Lee Hamilton Highway/Ind. 265 in Utica, Ind.\n\nRiverLink officials have held a series of community open houses in February and March in Louisville, Southern Indiana and Oldham County to explain the new system and give drivers a chance to ask questions. The last scheduled open house for now will be from 5:30 to 7 p.m. March 24 at the Sheraton Riverside Hotel, 700 W. Riverside Dr., in Jeffersonville. Transit Authority of River City (TARC) and the Kentuckiana Regional Planning & Development Agency (KIPDA) officials will be on hand to discuss the Ticket to Ride ride-share program.\n\nInitial toll rates will range from $1 to $12, depending on the size of the vehicle, whether a transponder is used and how often a driver crosses a tolled bridge.\n\nBuy Photo Thousands congregate on the Indiana side of the Louisville Municipal/Clark Memorial Bridge Nov. 1, 1946 near the toll plaza as the bridge is officially transferred to Kentucky.

That wasn't the case when tolls were charged on the Municipal/Clark Bridge, after it opened in 1929.\n\nFor Whom the Bridge Tolls\n\nIn August 1940, a 22-year-old guard named L.R. Kraus, armed with a revolver, is shown at a small police station at Second and Main streets in Louisville at the entrance to the Municipal Bridge, later renamed for George Rogers Clark. He was there to direct drivers to pay a toll on the Indiana side. A sign warns: \"No Reverse Turns.\"\n\nBuy Photo Hugh Cochran becomes the first driver to cross the Louisville Municipal/Clark Bridge for free Nov. 1, 1946 after tolls were eliminated. Bridge Officer F. M. Bennett waves him on. (Photo: The Courier-Journal archives)\n\nA toll plaza with stop signs and booths manned by \"bridge officers\" stretched across the bridge road on the Jeffersonville side. The toll was 35 cents in 1929 and was reduced later, according to the Louisville Times. Tolls were eliminated Nov. 1, 1946.\n\nAfter that, one toll booth was remodeled and converted to a Kentucky & Louisville Information Center run by the Kentucky Highway Department. \"Two loyal Kentuckians answer questions of thousands of motorists every year\" at the center, the Louisville Times said.\n\nAmong them were Mary Bennett and Dorothy Dudley, identified in a 1950 CJ photo. In 1953, the driver of a car with a Kansas license plate is shown looking at a map with a center attendant, and a trucker confers with attendants in a 1950 CJ photo.\n\nBuy Photo Attendants greet a driver in April of 1950 at the Kentucky & Louisville Information Center, which was created by remodeling a toll booth.

Hurstbourne Pkwy., to genealogical aficionados at a Louisville Genealogical Society meeting March 6. Kathleen is president of the Beautification League of Louisville & Jefferson County, which owns and maintains the home.\n\nWe have been invited to talk again about Nunnlea, built by early settlers of the Jeffersontown area and saved from destruction by the league, at the next meeting of the Greater Jeffersontown Historical Society. The meeting, which is open to the public, will be at 7 p.m. Monday, April 4 at Nunnlea. Please join us.\n\nReporter Martha Elson can be reached at (502) 582-7061 and melson@courier-journal.com.
