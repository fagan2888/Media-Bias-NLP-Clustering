In a letter last week to the company\u2019s CEO, Ann Wojcicki, the FDA stated that the company is in violation of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act due to its marketing of a service that hadn\u2019t received official clearance or approval.\n\n\u201c[The] FDA is concerned about the public health consequences of inaccurate results from the PGS device,\u201d the letter explained.\n\nAnyone can order a DNA kit from 23andMe\u2019s online store, which is designed to collect a sample of saliva that is then sent back to the company for genetic analysis. The company then provides health recommendations based on the results of the test. People may be advised, for example, to adjust their diet based on the detection of genetic signatures that indicate a greater risk for celiac disease, which causes gluten sensitivity.\n\nIn the letter, the FDA clarified that the intended use of 23andMe\u2019s product expanded for use in \u201cdiagnosis of disease or other conditions, or in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease, or is intended to affect the structure or function of the body.\u201d The agency also pointed out that the company markets PGS as a tool that provides insight about a person\u2019s \u201ccarrier status,\u201d \u201chealth risk,\u201d and \u201cdrug response\u201d with regard to over 250 diseases and conditions along with actionable steps that can be taken toward \u201cmanaging serious diseases.\u201d The problem is that this growing list of proposed uses for the PGS device has yet to be classified and obtain premarket approval \u2014 an issue that the FDA had communicated to 23andMe on previous occasions.\n\n\u201cSome of the uses for which PGS is intended are particularly concerning,\u201d the FDA wrote in the communications, \u201cbecause of the potential health consequences that could result from false positive or false negative assessments for high-risk indications.\u201d The agency noted that a false positive for a gene that is a red flag for breast or ovarian cancer, for example, could result in a patient undergoing an invasive battery of tests and procedures that are unnecessary. Conversely, a false negative could mislead patients away from undergoing necessary tests.\n\nThe FDA also warned that 23andMe could provide misleading assessments that result in patients dangerously changing their drug regimen. \u201cThe risk of serious injury or death is known to be high when patients are either non-compliant or not properly dosed,\u201d the letter warned, \u201c[C]ombined with the risk that a direct-to-consumer test result may be used by a patient to self-manage, serious concerns are raised if test results are not adequately understood by patients or if incorrect test results are reported.\u201d\n\nAccording to the letter, the FDA\u2019s Office of In Vitro Diagnostics and Radiological Health had been \u201cdiligently working to help\u201d 23andMe properly comply with regulatory standards since July of 2009. Specifically, The FDA guided the company towards obtaining various types of approval by, for example, proposing labeling modifications as well as explaining the kind of clinical data that needs to be submitted. \u201cHowever, even after these many interactions with 23andMe, we still do not have any assurance that the firm has analytically or clinically validated the PGS for its intended uses, which have been expanded from the uses that the firm identified in its submissions.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "fda, 23andme, genetics, genome testing, personal genome service, dna analysis", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "An FDA letter to DNA-analysis company 23andMe has halted the marketing and sale of their Personal Genome Service after failing to comply with certain rules.", "title": "FDA Tells 23andMe To Stop Selling Personal Genome Service", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/fda-tells-23andme-stop-selling-personal-genome-service-notes-many-uses-saliva-kit-havent-been-263684", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/11/25/shutterstock-dna-analysis-image.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "An FDA letter to DNA-analysis company 23andMe has halted the marketing and sale of their Personal Genome Service after failing to comply with certain rules.", "title": "FDA Tells 23andMe To Stop Selling Personal Genome Service", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/fda-tells-23andme-stop-selling-personal-genome-service-notes-many-uses-saliva-kit-havent-been-263684", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/11/25/shutterstock-dna-analysis-image.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/11/25/shutterstock-dna-analysis-image.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Consumer News", "published_time": "2013-11-25T16:00:58-05:00", "modified_time": "2013-11-25T16:05:41-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "An FDA letter to DNA-analysis company 23andMe has halted the marketing and sale of their Personal Genome Service after failing to comply with certain rules."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe291a\"", "article_summary": "The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) ordered the DNA analysis service, 23andMe, to discontinue the promotion of their Personal Genome Service (PGS).\n\u201c[The] FDA is concerned about the public health consequences of inaccurate results from the PGS device,\u201d the letter explained.\nThe FDA also warned that 23andMe could provide misleading assessments that result in patients dangerously changing their drug regimen.\nThe company then provides health recommendations based on the results of the test.\nAnyone can order a DNA kit from 23andMe\u2019s online store, which is designed to collect a sample of saliva that is then sent back to the company for genetic analysis."}
