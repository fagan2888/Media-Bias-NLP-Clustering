HARRISBURG, Pa. >> Pennsylvania’s Democratic candidates for U.S. Senate will gather Friday night for a 90-minute debate with two months until Democrats pick a challenger to Republican incumbent Pat Toomey in the fall election.

John Fetterman, Katie McGinty and Joe Sestak are expected at the debate at the Keystone Progress Summit, which bills itself as Pennsylvania’s largest annual gathering of progressive activists.

The candidates are virtually identical on bedrock Democratic Party issues, from supporting the Affordable Care Act and abortion rights to backing President Barack Obama on immigration reform and climate change.

Polling in the race is light and many voters are undecided.

Last month’s Franklin and Marshall College poll of 361 registered Democrats found that three in five were undecided. The poll showed Sestak with the most support at 17 percent.
