Ranking Democrat Sherrod Brown has called it \u201ca sprawling industry wish list of Dodd-Frank rollbacks,\u201d referring to the 2010 Wall Street Reform Act.\n\nThe bill also aims to enforce greater transparency for the Fed and other financial regulators.\n\nShelby, an Alabama Republican, must now exercise his dealmaking skills, with aides and analysts saying he needs votes from at least three Democrats on the committee to bring the bill to the Senate floor.\n\nThat challenge looked tougher on Thursday, with moderate Democrat Mark Warner of Virginia railing against the bill process, and strongly backing Brown.\n\n\u201cWe continue to believe there is ample room for both sides to come together,\u201d said Bipartisan Policy Council Director Aaron Klein, expressing disappointment with the partisan vote.\n\nOne of the proposals is for the Fed to evaluate bank holding companies with assets of $50 billion to $500 billion for enhanced capital and stress test requirements. That would be a significant change to Dodd-Frank, which requires banks bigger than $50 billion to be subject to that level of supervision.\n\nBank of New York Mellon Corp., PNC Financial Services Inc, and State Street are among the banks that could benefit from the higher threshold.\n\nBrown signaled a willingness to negotiate the new threshold, saying he agreed not all banks above $50 billion needed to be regulated like big banks. His alternative bill was voted down by the committee on Thursday.\n\nDemocrat Joe Donnelly voted in favor of two of Thursday\u2019s Republican amendments, the only Democrat to do so.\n\n[Insurance Sections\n\n[The insurance sections of the Senate\u2019s Financial Regulatory Improvement Act of 2015 include a provision affirming that state regulation under the McCarran-Ferguson Act is the \u201cpreferred approach\u201d to regulating insurance.\n\nIn terms of international insurance capital standards and regulation, the bill instructs Congress that the Federal Reserve, the Federal Insurance Office and state insurance regulators \u201cshould develop consensus positions in international discussions\u201d on capital standards for insurers and \u201cincrease transparency\u201d in those discussions. It also establishes an advisory committee on insurance matters at the Federal Reserve. It further establishes reporting and testimony timelines for the Federal Reserve, the Treasury and state insurance regulators (if they so choose) with regard to such international discussions.]\n\nThe legislation also includes language supported by the Independent Insurance Agents and Brokers of America (Big \u201cI\u201d) that ensures that insurance assets intended for the benefit of consumers cannot be raided for any other purposes other than protecting policyholders.]\n\n(Reporting by Michael Flaherty and Sarah Lynch; Editing by Richard Chang)\n\nRelated:\n\nBelow find both a discussion draft of the Financial Regulatory Improvement Act of 2015 and section-by-section summaries.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30;polling-uri=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.insurancejournal.com/rss/mostpopular/&polling-uri2=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.insurancejournal.com/rss/mostpopular/&id=2;polling-uri3=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.insurancejournal.com/rss/mostpopular/&id=3;polling-uri4=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.insurancejournal.com/rss/mostpopular/&id=4;polling-uri5=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.insurancejournal.com/rss/mostpopular/&id=5; cycle=1", "description": "A bill to ease regulations across the U.S. financial sector passed a Senate committee on Thursday with no support from Democrats, in a setback to the large", "application-name": "Insurance Journal", "og": {"site_name": "Insurance Journal", "description": "A bill to ease regulations across the U.S. financial sector passed a Senate committee on Thursday with no support from Democrats, in a setback to the large", "title": "Senate Committee Passes Dodd-Frank Relief Bill Without Democrats", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://www.insurancejournal.com/img/insurancejournal-square.png", "updated_time": "2015-05-22T11:08:49-04:00", "url": "http://www.insurancejournal.com/news/national/2015/05/22/369109.htm", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A bill to ease regulations across the U.S. financial sector passed a Senate committee on Thursday with no support from Democrats, in a setback to the large", "creator": "@ijournal", "image": "https://www.insurancejournal.com/img/insurancejournal-square.png", "title": "Senate Committee Passes Dodd-Frank Relief Bill Without Democrats", "site": "@ijournal", "card": "summary"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#B10000", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "/img/insurance-journal-tile-128x128.png", "robots": "noodp", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "/img/insurance-journal-tile-558x558.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "/img/insurance-journal-tile-558x270.png", "fb": {"page_id": 75524109257, "pages": 75524109257, "app_id": 106194681485}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/img/insurance-journal-tile-144x144.png", "msapplication-starturl": "/?utm_source=windows&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=windows-pinned-sites", "date": "2015-05-22", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/insurancejournal", "section": "National News", "tag": "Senate banking reform", "published_time": "2015-05-22T08:49:56-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-05-22T11:08:49-04:00"}, "msapplication-square150x150logo": "/img/insurance-journal-tile-270x270.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe4a0c\"", "article_summary": "The Senate Banking Committee cleared the Financial Regulatory Improvement Act of 2015 with all 12 Republicans voting in favor, and all 10 Democrats voting against.\nThe relief bill, crafted by Committee Chairman Richard Shelby and his staff, is mainly focused on easing regulatory burdens on small financial institutions.\n(Reporting by Michael Flaherty and Sarah Lynch; Editing by Richard Chang)Related:Below find both a discussion draft of the Financial Regulatory Improvement Act of 2015 and section-by-section summaries.\nIt further establishes reporting and testimony timelines for the Federal Reserve, the Treasury and state insurance regulators (if they so choose) with regard to such international discussions.]\nBank of New York Mellon Corp., PNC Financial Services Inc, and State Street are among the banks that could benefit from the higher threshold."}
