Gov. Nancy Wyman\n\nAn estimated 2,200 customers who purchase their insurance through Access Health CT will be losing their subsidy because they failed to file their 2014 federal taxes.\n\nAccess Health CEO James Wadleigh said last week that he received information from the Internal Revenue Service alerting him that 2,200 Connecticut customers have not filed their 2014 tax returns. It\u2019s the first time state exchanges received this type of information.\n\nThat means those customers may have some sticker shock when the bill arrives. Wadleigh said those 2,200 receive about $1.1 million in advanced premium tax credits. Wadleigh said he believes all 2,200 are still currently enrolled in coverage through the exchange. However, telling them they lost their subsidy because they failed to file their taxes is nearly impossible.\n\nUnder the Affordable Care Act, \u201dstates are not allowed to store any tax information or communicate anything related to taxes,\u201d Wadleigh said in a conference call. \u201cWe\u2019re really limited in our ability to say \u2018you didn\u2019t file your taxes\u2019.\u201d\n\nHe said they\u2019ve asked Connecticut\u2019s Congressional delegation to get involved.\n\nThe exchange is currently working on language for a postcard to ask customers to check their federal tax status as they race toward a Dec. 15 deadline for customers who want their coverage to continue or start on Jan. 1, 2016.\n\nThe problem is a different problem than the one this summer, which caused 7,000 Connecticut residents to lose their insurance, Wadleigh said.\n\nThat problem involved the creation of a new application every time a customer updated or changed their information. Those multiple applications, in addition to the notices requesting verification documents, cause a \u201csnowball effect\u201d and created confusion for consumers, Wadleigh has said.\n\nAbout 7,000 customers didn\u2019t submit the proper documentation to maintain coverage at that time, while 16,000 were working their way through the process.\n\nRight now about 3 to 5 percent of its customer base is dropping out of the exchange because they aren\u2019t submitting the proper forms of identification or income information in the 90-day period, Wadleigh said.\n\nThere\u2019s another 10,000 Access Health customers who have failed to auto-renew their coverage and have not signed up yet for a plan, Lt. Gov. Nancy Wyman, who co-chairs the Access Health Board of Directors, said.\n\n\u201cWe realize we\u2019re a little shorter than we thought and we need to get the word out,\u201d Wyman said last week during a conference call with reporters.\n\nFor customers who currently have coverage and need to maintain their coverage next year they will need to enroll by Tuesday, Dec. 15.\n\nOpen enrollment began Nov. 1 and will end Jan. 31, which is the shortest enrollment period since the exchanges opened in 2013.\n\nWadleigh declined to give reporters numbers about how many individuals have enrolled in the exchange since it opened on Nov. 1.\n\nAs of Nov. 19, which was the last Access Health Board of Directors meeting, about 99,127 individuals have enrolled with one of the four private carriers on the exchange. Most of those were auto-renewed in plans. About 5,470 customers signed up for insurance in the first 19 days of this year\u2019s enrollment.", "article_metadata": {"publisher": "CT News Junkie", "og": {"url": "http://www.ctnewsjunkie.com/archives/entry/2200_connecticut_residents_could_lose_their_healthcare_subsidies/", "type": "article", "site_name": "CT News Junkie", "description": "An estimated 2,200 customers who purchase their insurance through Access Health CT will be losing their subsidy because they failed to file their 2014 federal taxes.", "title": "2,200 Connecticut Residents Could Lose Their Healthcare Subsidies | CT News Junkie"}, "robots": "index,follow,archive", "fb": {"admins": 100000516708778, "app_id": 625264840857145}, "google-site-verification": "xSWCEDPXS2srINlbzkJoWA5QowbCkai3awnZqgts9xc", "viewport": "width=1474"}, "article_summary": "The problem is a different problem than the one this summer, which caused 7,000 Connecticut residents to lose their insurance, Wadleigh said.\nThere\u2019s another 10,000 Access Health customers who have failed to auto-renew their coverage and have not signed up yet for a plan, Lt.
