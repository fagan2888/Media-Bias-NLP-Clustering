Matt Bevin has promised to dismantle by the end of the year.\n\nHealth and Human Services Cabinet Vickie Yates Glisson said the plan does away with the paper-version of the application \u2014 the program will be entirely online.\n\n\u201cWhether you live in any of our 120 counties, there should be access to a computer system that you will be able to come in and access these programs,\u201d Glisson said.\n\nThe new program will also serve as an application hub for other state health, food and cash assistance programs, replacing the Kentucky Automated Management Eligibility System.\n\nOver the three years that Kynect has been open, the state has spent about $330 million operating Kynect, but the system was mostly funded through federal grants, according to the Health Cabinet.\n\nGlisson called Kynect \u201cunsustainable.\u201d\n\nRelated Story Bevin Notifies Federal Government He\u2019ll Dismantle Kynect\n\n\u201cThose favorable federal dollars are now ending. We have to maintain it, we have to operate it,\u201d Glisson said.\n\n\u201cThey gave it to us and they said, \u2018Now it is yours to maintain and operate.\u2019 And that comes at a heavy cost.\u201d\n\nThe federal government gave Kentucky a $289 million to create Kynect. Glisson said the state will have to return $39 million in unused funds, though last week federal officials said the state would have to return $57 million.\n\nDemocratic lawmakers clashed with Glisson during a committee hearing on Tuesday.\n\nRep. Joni Jenkins, a Louisville Democrat, said she\u2019s concerned that people will fall off the healthcare rolls and return to their status before the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cPeople were getting healthcare \u2014 they were just getting it through the most expensive way possible which is through the emergency room,\u201d Jenkins said.\n\nKentucky experienced one of the greatest drops in the uninsured population, going from over 20 percent in 2013 to 7.5 percent at the end of 2015.\n\nGlisson says that Benefind will direct those seeking qualified health care plans to the federal health exchange, healthcare.gov.\n\nMeanwhile the state\u2019s new Medicaid commissioner said that the cost of the Medicaid program \u2014 one of the largest expenditures in the budget \u2014will cost about 20 percent more over the next two years, rising to over $3.7 billion\n\nRep. Jim Wayne, another Louisville Democrat, said that the state could afford these programs and more if it revised its tax system.\n\n\u201cIf people who are as wealthy as the governor would pay their fair share in state and local taxes, we know that these type of programs could easily be sustainable,\u201d Wayne said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Medicaid recipients previously applied for benefits using Kynect, the state health exchange that Gov.
