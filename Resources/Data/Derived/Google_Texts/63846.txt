The gas company that services a New Jersey house where an explosion killed one person and critically injured two others this week says no leak was evident the day before the blast.

A spokesman for Elizabethtown Gas also says the company wasn't aware that a ground-floor area had been illegally converted into an apartment with gas and electric services that were off the books.

The Wednesday explosion in Elizabeth killed a 24-year-old man and left two others in critical condition. Several other residents were injured.

Elizabeth Mayor Chris Bollwage said Friday that an apartment behind the garage was illegally receiving gas and electric.

Bollwage says some residents told investigators that they smelled gas the day before the explosion and told the owner, but that the owner has denied this.
