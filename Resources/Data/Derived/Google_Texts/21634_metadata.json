A new poverty risk calculator offers an estimate based on four factors: race, education, marital status, and age.\n\nThe idea behind this tool is similar to the logic behind the many heart disease calculators available online, says Mark Rank, a professor of social welfare at Washington University in St. Louis and co-author with Thomas Hirschl, a sociology professor at Cornell University of Chasing the American Dream: Understanding What Shapes Our Fortunes.\n\nBased on hundreds of thousands of case records taken from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, an ongoing longitudinal study of Americans begun in 1968, the calculator estimates the percentage of Americans who will experience poverty in the next 5, 10 or 15 years. The poverty line for a family of four in 2015 was approximately $24,000.\n\nRelated: 8 Million Adults Could Be Driven into Poverty \u2014 Because They Have Jobs\n\nWhat Americans will quickly discover as they use this new tool, Rank says, is that for many, the future risk of poverty is far from trivial.\n\n\u201cTake the case of someone who might be thought of as having an overall low risk of poverty,\u201d he says. \u201cThe 15-year risk of poverty for an American who is in their later 30s, white, not married, and with an education beyond the high school level, is 32 percent.\u201d\n\nNevertheless, the calculator also demonstrates just how vast the inequalities in the US actually are. \u201cPeople can see exactly how much inequality there is in America by comparing their profile with others.\u201d\n\n\u201cRace, education, marital status, and age make a huge difference in terms of who is more or less likely to experience poverty in the years ahead,\u201d Rank says. \u201cFor example, the five-year risk of poverty for an American between the ages of 45-49, who is white, married, and with an education beyond high school, is 5 percent.\u201d\n\nRelated: How to Dramatically Lower the Poverty Rate Overnight\n\nIn contrast, Rank says, the risk of poverty for an individual between the ages of 25-29, who is nonwhite, not married, and with an education of high school or less, is \u201ca whopping 72 percent.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn many ways, these divides have only been growing wider over time,\u201d Rank adds.\n\nAs a result, not only can this calculator determine personal poverty risk, it also allows users to see just how profound the demographic fault lines are likely to be in the future.\n\n\u201cThe calculator is a new way for Americans to look into the future and estimate their overall economic risk,\u201d Rank says. \u201cIt simply has not been done before. In addition, people can see exactly how much inequality there is in America by comparing their profile with others.\u201d\n\nThis article originally appeared in Futurity.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "How many Americans are truly at risk of financial ruin?", "title": "Now You Can Measure Your Chances of Ending Up in Poverty", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/03/07/Now-You-Can-Measure-Your-Chances-Ending-Poverty", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/usa-poverty_2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/03/07/Now-You-Can-Measure-Your-Chances-Ending-Poverty", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/usa-poverty_2.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "How many Americans are truly at risk of financial ruin?", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "A new poverty risk calculator offers an estimate based on four factors: race, education, marital status, and age.\n\u201cTake the case of someone who might be thought of as having an overall low risk of poverty,\u201d he says.\n\u201cThe calculator is a new way for Americans to look into the future and estimate their overall economic risk,\u201d Rank says.\nAs a result, not only can this calculator determine personal poverty risk, it also allows users to see just how profound the demographic fault lines are likely to be in the future.\nThe poverty line for a family of four in 2015 was approximately $24,000."}
