As most of us here at Pearl Izumi are dog owners, we want you to know we would never, ever do anything to harm an animal. Please know that we have deleted the ad and removed it from all future publications.\u201d\n\nPearl Izumi posted another update on its running Facebook page Friday, further apologizing and noting that the company is making a $10,000 donation to the Boulder Valley Humane Society to prove its commitment to healthy pets.\n\nMargaret Campbell, a marketing professor at the University of Colorado at Boulder, said that the biggest mistake Pearl Izumi likely made was not testing out the ad on consumers before running it.\n\n\u201cSeveral different companies have fallen into this same trap over time,\u201d Campbell said. \u201cHumor is hard to get right; it is easy to offend. So, I always say go out on the street and test it on at least a few people.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Pearl Izumi catches heat for ad portraying a dead dog", "title": "Pearl Izumi catches heat for ad portraying a dead dog", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2013/09/06/pearl-izumi-catches-heat-for-ad-portraying-a-dead-dog/", "image": {"width": 450, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20130906__Pearl_Izumi_adp1.jpg", "height": 600}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20130906__Pearl_Izumi_adp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2013-09-06T13:51:10+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-29T12:47:12+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Louisville-based sports-apparel firm Pearl Izumi is trying to make amends with the outraged public over a controversial running-shoe ad featuring a dead dog.\nAs most of us here at Pearl Izumi are dog owners, we want you to know we would never, ever do anything to harm an animal.\nMargaret Campbell, a marketing professor at the University of Colorado at Boulder, said that the biggest mistake Pearl Izumi likely made was not testing out the ad on consumers before running it.\nSo, I always say go out on the street and test it on at least a few people.\u201d\n\u201cSeveral different companies have fallen into this same trap over time,\u201d Campbell said."}
