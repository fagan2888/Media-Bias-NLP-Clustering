Since becoming law, Obamacare has forced costs to skyrocket every single year,\u201d said Hamada. \u201cIn Tennessee, the Obamacare co-op is shutting down because costs were catastrophically high and insurance premiums will climb again in 2016.\u201d\n\nHamada says that Tennessee\u2019s 2016 insurance rate hike is one of the highest in the nation.\n\n\u201cIn 2014, Tennessee\u2019s benchmark plan was $188 a month. In 2016, the plan will cost at least $250,\u201d said Hamada. \u201cBy 2017, I expect the plan will be nearly $300. On average, premiums will cost at least 23 percent more in 2016.\u201d\n\nIn Utah, those who buy healthcare insurance through brokers or the HealthCare.gov Obamacare exchange will see rate hikes up to 44 percent. The price of an average insurance plan for a 21-year-old will go up 13 percent to nearly $165 per month in urban Salt Lake County. Meanwhile, a 21-year-old living in rural Rich County will see a substantial 44 percent price hike to nearly $228 per month.\n\nOklahoma will see a 35.7 percent increase; Montana will have a 34.5 percent increase; Alaska will have a 31.5 percent increase; New Mexico will have a 25.8 percent increase; and South Dakota will have a 24.7 percent increase.\n\nFor the first time since becoming law, the Obama administration publicly acknowledged that those purchasing health insurance will be paying more to do so during Monday\u2019s announcement.", "article_metadata": {"description": "October 27, 2015-- Insurance premiums across the country are about to skyrocket yet again thanks to President Obama's Affordable Care Act, more commonly...", "generator": "Powered by Visual Composer - drag and drop page builder for WordPress.", "author": "Michael Lotfi", "og": {"site_name": "Ben Swann's Truth In Media", "description": "October 27, 2015-- Insurance premiums across the country are about to skyrocket yet again thanks to President Obama's Affordable Care Act, more commonly...", "title": "Obamacare Forces 2016 Insurance Premiums To Skyrocket", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://truthinmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/us_healthcare001_16x9.jpg", "height": 360}, "url": "http://truthinmedia.com/obamacare-insurance-premiums-skyrocket/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "October 27, 2015-- Insurance premiums across the country are about to skyrocket yet again thanks to President Obama's Affordable Care Act, more commonly...", "creator": "@BenSwann_", "image": "http://truthinmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/us_healthcare001_16x9.jpg", "title": "Obamacare Forces 2016 Insurance Premiums To Skyrocket", "site": "@BenSwann_", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 801708913249498, "pages": 124075334324092}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/BenSwannRealityCheck", "section": "Health", "tag": "Obamacare", "published_time": "2015-10-28T10:38:46-04:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/MikeLotfiTN"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcaa08\"", "article_summary": "October 27, 2015\u2013 Insurance premiums across the country are about to skyrocket yet again thanks to President Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act, more commonly known as Obamacare.\n\u201cI see no end in sight for increasing insurance costs as long as Obamacare is the law of the land.\n\u201cIn Tennessee, the Obamacare co-op is shutting down because costs were catastrophically high and insurance premiums will climb again in 2016.\u201dHamada says that Tennessee\u2019s 2016 insurance rate hike is one of the highest in the nation.\nFormer Tennessee Medical Association board member and current Emergency department director Dr. Omar Hamada says that he expects Obamacare will force insurance premiums to continue climbing for the foreseeable future.\nSince becoming law, Obamacare has forced costs to skyrocket every single year,\u201d said Hamada."}
