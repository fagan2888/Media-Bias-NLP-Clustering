Yet the ability to wax poetic about trinkets, tools or traits may not be necessary to think about them abstractly, as was once suspected. A growing body of evidence suggests nonhuman animals can group living and inanimate things based on less than obvious shared traits, raising questions about how creatures accomplish this task.\n\nIn a study published last fall in the journalPeerJ, for example, Oakland University psychology researcher Jennifer Vonk investigated how well four orangutans and a western lowland gorilla from the Toronto Zoo could pair photographs of animals from the same biological groups.\n\nVonk presented the apes with a touch-screen computer and got them to tap an image of an animal\u2014for instance, a snake\u2014on the screen. Then she showed each ape two side-by-side animal pictures: one from the same category as the animal in the original image and one from another\u2014for example, images of a different reptile and a bird. When they correctly matched animal pairs, they received a treat such as nuts or dried fruit. When they got it wrong, they saw a black screen before beginning the next trial. After hundreds of such trials, Vonk found that all five apes could categorize other animals better than expected by chance (although some individuals were better at it than others). The researchers were impressed that the apes could learn to classify mammals of vastly different visual characteristics together\u2014such as turtles and snakes\u2014suggesting the apes had developed concepts for reptiles and other categories of animals based on something other than shared physical traits.", "article_metadata": {"description": "New research suggests man's best friend is among a number of animal species with the capacity for abstract thought", "author": "Andrea Anderson", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "New research suggests man's best friend is among a number of animal species with the capacity for abstract thought", "title": "Canine geniuses?
