The timing of the visit presents the government with difficult questions, including whether to proceed at all, given the hundreds of thousands of students already massing at Tiananmen Square.

Virtually airbrushed out of China's recent history, he will remain under house arrest, rarely allowed out of his home, until his death in 2005.
