Silverstein and Cepenas both work with Comprehensive Pharmacy Services in Memphis, Tennessee, which manages Mercy's pharmacy-related services.\n\nIn another example of the growing role pharmacists play in healthcare, they credit the success of the program to the participation of a pharmacists, who conduct a comprehensive medication history and hospital course evaluation on patients.\n\nThe discharge clinic opened in October 2013 and is housed at Mercy's affiliate, the Mercy Family Health Center, a community-based outpatient facility. Mercy's mission includes providing care for Chicago's underserved population, including 300,000 uninsured, and it admits many high-risk patients, a group in jeopardy of being readmitted after discharge.\n\nThe hospital wanted to improve access to follow-up care to reduce those unnecessary readmissions and repeat emergency department visits. A pharmacy leadership team proposed opening the discharge clinic as a pilot program, offering 30-minute patient appointments half a day for six days a week, with a pharmacist available on three of the days. When the pharmacist was not scheduled, the nurse practitioner performed both a physical assessment and did the medication history and evaluation.\n\nResults posted within the first month of operation exceeded expectations. The readmission rates of patients seen by the nurse practitioner decreased. However, readmissions were reduced even more significantly when patients were seen by both the nurse practitioner and pharmacist, the authors wrote. As a whole, the discharge clinic saw readmission rates for all patients decrease from 7 percent in its first quarter to 1 percent a year later.\n\nThe pilot program was so successful, Mercy has increased staff for the clinic, expanded the pharmacist availability to all six days, and extended access to the clinic to all patients discharged from Mercy Hospital.\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- read the article\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nPharmacists take on bigger role, authority in healthcare\n\nInterprofessional care model shows promise for readmission reduction, ER use\n\nCan physician-pharmacist teams improve care?", "article_metadata": {"description": "In another example of\u00a0the growing role pharmacists play\u00a0in healthcare, a discharge clinic, staffed with a pharmacist and nurse practitioner who meet with patients after their release from the hospital, has helped Mercy Hospital & Medical Center in Chicago cut its\u00a0readmission rates, according to an\u00a0article\u00a0in\u00a0Hospit", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "In another example of\u00a0the growing role pharmacists play\u00a0in healthcare, a discharge clinic, staffed with a pharmacist and nurse practitioner who meet with patients after their release from the hospital, has helped Mercy Hospital & Medical Center in Chicago cut its\u00a0readmission rates, according to an\u00a0article\u00a0in\u00a0Hospit", "title": "Pharmacy-led clinic helps Chicago hospital slash readmission rates", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/pharmacy-led-clinic-helps-chicago-hospital-slash-readmission-rates/2015-06-19", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "Care Delivery,hospital readmissions,lowering readmissions,Mercy Hospital,nurse practitioner,Patient Care & Outcomes,Patient Engagement,Pharmacist", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Care Delivery,Patient Care & Outcomes,Patient Engagement"}, "article_summary": "The readmission rates of patients seen by the nurse practitioner decreased.\nA discharge clinic, staffed with a pharmacist and nurse practitioner who meet with patients after their release from the hospital, has helped Mercy Hospital & Medical Center in Chicago cut its readmission rates, according to an article in Hospitals and Health Networks Daily.\nWhen the pharmacist was not scheduled, the nurse practitioner performed both a physical assessment and did the medication history and evaluation.\nHowever, readmissions were reduced even more significantly when patients were seen by both the nurse practitioner and pharmacist, the authors wrote.\nAs a whole, the discharge clinic saw readmission rates for all patients decrease from 7 percent in its first quarter to 1 percent a year later."}
