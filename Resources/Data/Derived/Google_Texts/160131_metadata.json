It confirmed for the first time that American cyberattacks on Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities \u2014 presumably including the Israeli-American Stuxnet attack against Iranian computers that is regarded as the first shot of cyberwar \u2014 led Iran to retaliate in 2012 against American banks and the Saudi Arabian national oil company. Iran, the memo declared, \u201chas demonstrated a clear ability to learn from the capabilities and actions of others\u201d and would most likely continue the attacks.\n\nThe memo could just as easily have dealt with China, Russia, North Korea or the dozens of other states that are working to defend their computer systems or to sabotage those of other states. The problem is that unlike conventional weapons, with cyberweapons \u201cthere\u2019s no clear line between offense and defense,\u201d as President Obama noted this month in an interview with Re/code, a technology news publication. Defense in cyberwarfare consists of pre-emptively locating the enemy\u2019s weakness, which means getting into its networks. Recent attacks shows how easily systems considered impenetrable \u2014 major banks, Sony Pictures Entertainment, an electrical utility \u2014 can be invaded.\n\nThe N.S.A. document notes that Iran, for one, continues to adapt its techniques to \u201ccircumvent victim mitigation attempts,\u201d as other global cyberraiders probably do, constantly adding momentum to the digital arms race. And as the race quickens, so does the clash between privacy and cybersecurity. President Obama was right to call for a \u201cpublic conversation\u201d on finding an appropriate balance of privacy and safety.\n\nThe tougher challenge is on the global level. Cyberwarfare has already done considerable damage and can lead to devastating consequences. The best way forward is to accelerate international efforts to negotiate limits on the cyberarms race, akin to the arms-control treaties of the Cold War. Barring that, there are few viable ways to bring these new weapons and their use under control.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "opinion", "ptime": 20150226032709, "twitter": {"description": "An N.S.A. document from the Snowden trove presents a chilling summary of the escalation of cyberwarfare between the United States and Iran.", "title": "Arms Control for a Cyberage", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/26/opinion/arms-control-for-a-cyberage.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003536558"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/02/26/opinion/26thu2aweb/26thu2web-1424899821588-thumbLarge.jpg", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/26/opinion/arms-control-for-a-cyberage.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003536558", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/26/opinion/arms-control-for-a-cyberage.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "thumbnail_width": 75, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "opinion", "hdl_p": "Arms Control for a Cyberage", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "Feb. 26, 2015", "edt": "NewYork", "org": "National Security Agency", "keywords": "Cyberwarfare,National Security Agency,Iran,Espionage and Intelligence Services,Editorials,United States", "news_keywords": "Cyberwarfare,Iran,Editorial", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "The Editorial Board", "thumbnail_150": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/02/26/opinion/26thu2aweb/26thu2web-1424899821588-thumbLarge.jpg", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "thumbnail_150_width": 150, "byl": "By THE EDITORIAL BOARD", "thumbnail_150_height": 150, "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "An N.S.A. document from the Snowden trove presents a chilling summary of the escalation of cyberwarfare between the United States and Iran.", "tom": "Editorial", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/02/26/opinion/26thu2aweb/26thu2web-1424899821588-thumbStandard.jpg", "description": "An N.S.A. document from the Snowden trove presents a chilling summary of the escalation of cyberwarfare between the United States and Iran.", "CG": "opinion", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "Feb. 26, 2015", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "Editorial", "article": {"author": "http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/opinion/editorialboard.html", "section_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/pages/opinion/index.html", "section": "Opinion", "modified": "2015-02-26", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "tag": "United States", "published": "2015-02-26", "section-taxonomy-id": "AD8090D7-4137-4D71-84C8-70DA3BD89778"}, "thumbnail_height": 75, "geo": "United States", "slug": "26thu1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20150226163229, "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/26/opinion/arms-control-for-a-cyberage.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/02/26/opinion/26thu2aweb/26thu2web-1424899821588-facebookJumbo.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "An N.S.A. document from the Snowden trove presents a chilling summary of the escalation of cyberwarfare between the United States and Iran.", "title": "Arms Control for a Cyberage"}, "pdate": 20150226, "des": "Editorials", "articleid": 100000003536558, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "Arms Control for a Cyberage", "col": "Editorial", "PST": "Editorial"}, "article_summary": "Barring that, there are few viable ways to bring these new weapons and their use under control.\ndocument notes that Iran, for one, continues to adapt its techniques to \u201ccircumvent victim mitigation attempts,\u201d as other global cyberraiders probably do, constantly adding momentum to the digital arms race.\nRecent attacks shows how easily systems considered impenetrable \u2014 major banks, Sony Pictures Entertainment, an electrical utility \u2014 can be invaded.\nPresident Obama was right to call for a \u201cpublic conversation\u201d on finding an appropriate balance of privacy and safety.\ndocument \u2014 prepared in April 2013 for the agency\u2019s director \u2014 was revealed this month by The Intercept, a website that reports on the trove from the former N.S.A."}
