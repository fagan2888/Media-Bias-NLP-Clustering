Homeowners got an unexpected shock this week as new property tax bills hit them in their wallets.

The pain is palpable. The tax on the average home in the state last year was $8,161 — the highest in the nation. And the cost was more in Monmouth County, where the average was $8,448. Ocean County fared better at $5,719. Even if all the tax bills hold at a 2 percent increase this year, that’s an average boost of $160 per household. But as with averages, there are highs and lows, and some could be facing jumps in the hundreds of dollars — hardly welcomed news in a state economy where wages are stagnating or even going backwards.
