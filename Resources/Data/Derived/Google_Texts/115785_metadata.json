The Pew Research Center found that 78 percent of Americans think \u201cthe gap between rich and poor\u201d is a \u201cbig problem\u201d for the country. Moreover, the Public Religion Research Institute found 66 percent of Americans say \u201cgovernment should do more to reduce the gap between rich and poor.\u201d\n\nBut what do people mean when they say the government should \u201cdo more\u201d ? It could mean anything from income redistribution to deregulating industries to allow for more job creation. In fact, when Americans are offered more concrete alternatives, 58 percent of Americans think that private sector growth is a better method that government policy (31%) to reduce income inequality, according to a New Models National Brand Poll.\n\nIn sum, Americans care about income inequality and would prefer disparities attenuated. However, when policies intended to reduce income inequality conflict with those intended to promote growth, Americans opt for growth policies.\n\nThis implies that policy advocates should either explain why policies intended to reduce income inequality will ultimately come at the expense of economic growth, or alternatively why this would not occur.\n\nUltimately, if Americans must make a choice, they opt for a more prosperous economically differentiated society over a less prosperous economically egalitarian society.\n\nThe Reason-Rupe national telephone poll, executed by Princeton Survey Research Associates International, conducted live interviews with 1000 adults on cell phones (500) and landlines (500) August 6-10, 2014.
