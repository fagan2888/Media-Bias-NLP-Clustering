Yes, a known state-sponsor of terrorism is receiving billions that won\u2019t be spent on terrorist activities. Remember, Secretary of State John Kerry forcefully said, \u201cThey\u2019re not allowed to do that,\u201d whereas National Security Adviser Susan Rice admitted that some of that money could fund such nefarious operations. Given the numbers crunched by American Action Forum, this cash injection could increase Iran\u2019s terror funding by 50 percent.\n\nThe United States Institute of Peace and the Center for Arms Control and Nonproliferation have two separate analyses on Iran\u2019s military spending since we really don\u2019t know the actual figure\u2013and most of their terrorist funding is not listed in their official budgets (of course). USIP has Iran\u2019s military spending ranging between $12-14 billion; Arms Control says it\u2019s about $18 billion. AAF reported that Iran intends to spend 3.4 percent of its total budget in defense. That\u2019s $10 billion, 65 percent of which went to the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps\u2013one of Iran\u2019s elite combined forces units\u2013that also promotes and funds terrorism abroad. They also noted that that figure equals $6 billion, or 2.2 percent of the entire budget [emphasis mine]:", "article_metadata": {"description": "Welp..05/27/2016 11:18:07AM EST.", "author": "Matt Vespa", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Welp.", "title": "Matt Vespa - Good News: Iran Could Increase Terror Funding By 50 Percent From Unfrozen Assets", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/mattvespa/2015/08/20/good-news-iran-could-increase-terror-funding-by-50-percent-from-unfrozen-assets-n2041517", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2012/186/fa084b82-7bfc-499f-b6cc-5a937be18b4c.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "Welp.", "title": "Matt Vespa - Good News: Iran Could Increase Terror Funding By 50 Percent From Unfrozen Assets", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/mattvespa/2015/08/20/good-news-iran-could-increase-terror-funding-by-50-percent-from-unfrozen-assets-n2041517", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2012/186/fa084b82-7bfc-499f-b6cc-5a937be18b4c.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Good News: Iran Could Increase Terror Funding By 50 Percent From Unfrozen Assets, Matt Vespa, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "Given the numbers crunched by American Action Forum, this cash injection could increase Iran\u2019s terror funding by 50 percent.\nUSIP has Iran\u2019s military spending ranging between $12-14 billion; Arms Control says it\u2019s about $18 billion.\nThey also noted that that figure equals $6 billion, or 2.2 percent of the entire budget [emphasis mine]:\nYes, a known state-sponsor of terrorism is receiving billions that won\u2019t be spent on terrorist activities.\nAAF reported that Iran intends to spend 3.4 percent of its total budget in defense."}
