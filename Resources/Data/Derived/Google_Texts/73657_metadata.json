She worked in advertising, but when her sister died of breast cancer, she realised life was too short to put off the novel she wanted to write. The result was How I Live Now, published in 2004, just as Rosoff herself was diagnosed with breast cancer. The book won the Guardian children's fiction prize and was this year turned into a film. Her latest novel is Picture Me Gone. She lives in London with her husband and daughter.\n\nWhen were you happiest?\n\nSwimming in the North Sea at midnight, surrounded by phosphorescence.\n\nWhat is your earliest memory?\n\nWhen I was about two, I dreamt that a gorilla dragged away my older sister. There was blood everywhere.\n\nWhich living person do you most admire, and why?\n\nMy husband is the kindest, funniest, most strange and wondrous person I know.\n\nWhat is the trait you most deplore in yourself?\n\nI'm face blind, have a useless memory, a short attention span, hate cooking, am careless, clumsy, absent-minded, unconcerned with rules and inspire road rage.\n\nWhere would you like to live?\n\nThe entire top floor of Centre Point.\n\nWhat do you most dislike about your appearance?\n\nI've got reverse body dysmorphia, so when I look in the mirror, I see a younger, slimmer, more attractive version of myself. Photographs are a shock.\n\nIf you could bring something extinct back to life, what would you choose?\n\nMy youngest sister.\n\nWhat is your favourite smell?\n\nMy lurchers, after they've been swimming in a salt marsh lagoon.\n\nWhat is your favourite book?\n\nThe Unstrung Harp, by Edward Gorey: every writer should read it.\n\nWhat is your guiltiest pleasure?\n\nRiding slightly mad horses.\n\nTo whom would you most like to say sorry, and why?\n\nTo Noel, in sixth grade. He was mixed race with no father and was bussed into our suburban all-white school every day. I wanted to be his friend, but it was social suicide.\n\nWhich living person do you most despise?\n\nThe opponents of Obamacare.\n\nWhat is the worst job you've done?\n\nI spent 15 years in advertising, getting fired every 18 months or so. I'm proud of that record now, but at the time it was dispiriting.\n\nWhat has been your biggest disappointment?\n\nNot being born a boy.\n\nIf you could edit your past, what would you change?\n\nI wouldn't have gone to Harvard. It was the most ridiculously conventional place.\n\nWhen did you last cry, and why?\n\nIn August, when my middle sister called to tell me her breast cancer had spread to her spine, pelvis and bones. It turned out not to be true.\n\nWhat is the closest you've come to death?\n\nI flew Pan Am flight 103 from London to JFK on 20 December 1988. The next day, Pan Am 103 exploded over Lockerbie with no survivors.\n\nWhat single thing would improve the quality of your life?\n\nSomeone else to write my books.\n\nWhat do you consider your greatest achievement?\n\nMy daughter is brave, funny, clever and sane, despite being born into a genetic minefield.\n\nWhat song would you like played at your funeral?\n\nReasons To Be Cheerful, by Ian Dury.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#005689", "description": "My worst trait?
