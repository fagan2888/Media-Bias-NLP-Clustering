That\u2019s because the co-op is closing at the end of the year.\n\nThe nonprofit organization that has provided health insurance to members since 2013 on Friday quietly announced its plans to close. It is the largest provider of private health insurance plans through the state health insurance marketplace, Kynect.\n\nThe closing affects about 51,000 Kentuckians.\n\nCarrie Banahan, executive director of Kynect, said although the insurer\u2019s finances had recently begun to improve, it was no longer able to offer plans in 2016.\n\n\u201cBased on some guidance that was recently issued by CMS concerning risk corridor payments, they were expecting to receive $77 million, but they only received a little over 12 percent of that,\u201d she said, referring to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.\n\nThis year, the agency plans to pay out significantly less in risk corridor payments \u2014 a system established under ACA in which insurers contribute to a federal fund they can then tap to cover financial losses due to higher-than-average usage among members or customers. CMS fell $2.5 billion short on the payments in 2015.\n\nThe Republican-led Congress has been hostile toward the ACA and the risk corridor provision, and it appears unlikely they would provide funds to cover the additional losses.\n\nRelated Story Kentuckians, Get Ready For Health Insurance Rate Hikes\n\nThe Kentucky co-op earlier this year requested its second-straight rate increase of more than 20 percent, a sign of trouble.\n\n\u201cThey were really the lowest-cost option on Kynect in 2014, and as a result they attracted a lot of the individuals who were higher risk,\u201d Banahan said of the Kentucky Health Cooperative. \u201cAs a result, their claims costs were higher than other insurance companies.\u201d\n\nThe closing of the co-op is not unique to Kentucky. CoOpportunity Health, which provided insurance in Iowa and Nebraska, closed in February. And Louisiana Health Cooperative, Nevada Health Co-Op and Health Republic Insurance of New York are also set to close by the end of the year.\n\nA report by the Department of Health and Human Services shows Kentucky Health Cooperative estimated enrollment to be 30,929 by Dec. 31, 2014. In actuality, 56,680 people enrolled through the co-op.\n\nThe report stated that the members\u2019 claims exceeded its premium income.\n\nThe HHS also confirmed Banahan\u2019s explanation that more people with expensive health conditions enrolled in the co-op plans, while fewer-than-expected young and healthy people signed up. Another factor could have been inaccurate insurance premium pricing. The co-ops sought to promote competition on the new insurance marketplaces by offering low premiums.\n\nUnder the Affordable Care Act, CMS awarded loans to co-ops on the basis of their ability to become financially viable. But the department also found that many of them had lower-than-expected enrollment numbers and significant financial losses out of the gate.\n\nNazarenko is upset her policy will be canceled in the upcoming months. The co-op was sold as a low-cost health insurer managed by members and, as such, not subject to similar pressures as other commercial insurers.\n\nShe said she hopes she will still be able to qualify for Medicaid through another insurance provider. Otherwise, she fears she won\u2019t be able to afford the cost of health insurance.\n\n\u201cI might very well be facing the reality that I will once again be uninsured, which is frustrating,\u201d Nazarenko said. \u201cBut until I\u2019m able to get a job that has health care benefits that are affordable, that may be a possibility. I just might have to be uninsured once again.\u201d\n\nBanahan said Kentuckians currently enrolled with the co-op should expect a letter in the mail later this month advising them that their plan is no longer available in 2016. She said they will need to select a new plan by Dec. 15 to secure a Jan. 1, 2016, effective date.\n\nThe letter also will include a list of insurance providers in an individual\u2019s county. In 2016, seven insurers will offer plans through Kynect: Aetna, Anthem, Baptist Health, CareSource, Humana, United Healthcare and WellCare.\n\nKynect offered plans from five insurers last year.
