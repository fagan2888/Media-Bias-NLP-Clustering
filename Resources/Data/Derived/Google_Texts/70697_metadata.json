Fifty-nine percent of those polled in June agreed that \u201cthe American dream has become impossible for most people to achieve.\u201d More and more Americans believe there is \u201cnot much opportunity\u201d to get ahead.\n\nThe public has reached this conclusion for a very simple reason: It\u2019s true. The key elements of the American dream\u2014a living wage, retirement security, the opportunity for one\u2019s children to get ahead in life\u2014are now unreachable for all but the wealthiest among us. And it\u2019s getting worse. As inequality increases, the fundamental elements of the American dream are becoming increasingly unaffordable for the majority.\n\nHere are seven ways the American dream is dying.\n\n1. Most people can\u2019t get ahead financially.\n\nIf the American dream means a reasonable rate of income growth for working people, most people can\u2019t expect to achieve it.\n\nAs Ben Casselman observes at fivethirtyeight.com, the middle class hasn\u2019t seen its wage rise in 15 years. In fact, the percentage of middle-class households in this nation is actually falling. Median household income has fallen since the financial crisis of 2008, while income for the wealthiest of Americans has actually risen.\n\nThomas Edsall wrote in the New York Timesthat \u201cNot only has the wealth of the very rich doubled since 2000, but corporate revenues are at record levels.\u201d Edsall also observed that, \u201cIn 2013, according to Goldman Sachs, corporate profits rose five times faster than wages.\u201d\n\n2. The stay-at-home parent is a thing of the past.\n\nThere was a time when middle-class families could lead a comfortable lifestyle on one person\u2019s earnings. One parent could work while the other stayed home with the kids.\n\nThose days are gone. As Elizabeth Warren and co-author Amelia Warren Tyagi documented in their 2003 book, The Two-Income Trap, the increasing number of two-earner families was matched by rising costs in a number of areas such as education, home costs and transportation.\n\nThese cost increases, combined with wage stagnation, mean that families are struggling to make ends meet\u2014and that neither parent has the luxury of staying home any longer. In fact, parenthood has become a financial risk. Warren and Tyagi write that \u201cHaving a child is now the single best predictor that a woman will end up in financial collapse.\u201d This book was written over a decade ago; things are even worse today.\n\n3. The rich are more debt-free. Others have no choice.\n\nMost Americans are falling behind anyway, as their salary fails to keep up with their expenses. No wonder debt is on the rise. As Joshua Freedman and Sherle R. Schwenninger observe in a paper for the New America Foundation, \u201cAmerican households\u2026 have become dependent on debt to maintain their standard of living in the face of stagnant wages.\u201d\n\nThis \u201cdebt-dependent economy,\u201d as Freedman and Schwenninger call it, has negative implications for the nation as a whole. But individual families are suffering too.\n\nRani Molla of the Wall Street Journal notes that \u201cOver the past 20 years the average increase in spending on some items has exceeded the growth of incomes. The gap is especially poignant for those under 25 years old.\u201d\n\nThere are increasingly two classes of Americans: Those who are taking on additional debt, and the rich.\n\n4. Student debt is crushing a generation of non-wealthy Americans.\n\nEducation for every American who wants to get ahead? Forget about it. Nowadays you have to be rich to get a college education; that is, unless you want to begin your career with a mountain of debt. Once you get out of college, you\u2019ll quickly discover that the gap between spending and income is greatest for people under 25 years of age.\n\nEducation, as Forbescolumnist Steve Odland put it in 2012, is \u201cthe great equalizer\u2026 the facilitator of the American dream.\u201d But at that point college costs had risen 500 percent since 1985, while the overall consumer price index rose by 115 percent. As of 2013, tuition at a private university was projected to cost nearly $130,000 on average over four years, and that\u2019s not counting food, lodging, books, or other expenses.\n\nPublic colleges and universities have long been viewed as the get-ahead option for all Americans, including the poorest among us. Not anymore. The University of California was once considered a national model for free, high-quality public education, but today tuition at UC Berkeley is $12,972 per year. (It was tuition-free until Ronald Reagan became governor.) Room and board is $14,414. The total cost of on-campus attendance at Berkeley, including books and other items, is estimated to be $32,168.\n\nThe California story has been repeated across the country, as state cutbacks in the wake of the financial crisis caused the cost of public higher education to soar by 15 percent in a two-year period. With a median national household income of $51,000, even public colleges are quickly becoming unaffordable\n\nSure, there are still some scholarships and grants available. But even as college costs rise, the availability of those programs is falling, leaving middle-class and lower-income students further in debt as out-of-pocket costs rise.\n\n5. Vacations aren\u2019t for the likes of you anymore.\n\nThink you\u2019d like to have a nice vacation? Think again. According to a 2012 American Express survey, Americans who were planning vacations expected to spend an average of $1,180 per person. That\u2019s $4,720 for a family of four. But then, why worry about paying for that vacation? If you\u2019re unemployed, you can\u2019t afford it. And even if you have a job, there\u2019s a good chance you won\u2019t get the time off anyway.\n\nAs the Center for Economic and Policy Research found in 2013, the United States is the only advanced economy in the world that does not require employers to offer paid vacations to their workers. The number of paid holidays and vacation days received by the average worker in this country (16) would not meet the statutory minimum requirements in 19 other developed countries, according to the CEPR. Thirty-one percent of workers in smaller businesses had no paid vacation days at all.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A living wage, retirement security and a life free of debt are now only accessible to the country's wealthiest", "author": "Richard (RJ) Eskow", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "A living wage, retirement security and a life free of debt are now only accessible to the country's wealthiest", "title": "7 facts that show the American dream is dead", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/10/25/7_facts_that_show_the_american_dream_is_dead_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/10/shutterstock_137946113.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A living wage, retirement security and a life free of debt are now only accessible to the country's wealthiest", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/10/shutterstock_137946113.jpg", "title": "7 facts that show the American dream is dead", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "7 facts that show the American dream is dead", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, AlterNet, American Dream, Middle Class, Minimum wage, Thomas Piketty", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8591\"", "article_summary": "Topics: AlterNet, American Dream, Middle Class, Minimum wage, Thomas Piketty, Politics NewsThis article originally appeared on AlterNetA recent poll showed that more than half of all people in this country don\u2019t believe that the American dream is real.\nAs inequality increases, the fundamental elements of the American dream are becoming increasingly unaffordable for the majority.\nIf the American dream means a reasonable rate of income growth for working people, most people can\u2019t expect to achieve it.\nHere are seven ways the American dream is dying.\nFifty-nine percent of those polled in June agreed that \u201cthe American dream has become impossible for most people to achieve.\u201d More and more Americans believe there is \u201cnot much opportunity\u201d to get ahead."}
