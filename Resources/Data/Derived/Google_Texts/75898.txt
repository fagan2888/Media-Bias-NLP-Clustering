When presidential popularity sags, the predictable calls begin: Off with their heads! The heads, of course, belong to key administrators and Cabinet officials who are perceived to have contributed to whatever woes are besetting the president.

The calls come from both friends and foes of the White House. The friends want to satisfy and silence baying opponents with a pound of prominent flesh; the foes hope it’s just the first pound.

President Obama has been resistant to dismissing any senior person. He refused to fire Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius during the disastrous Obamacare rollout (though Sebelius later resigned). Nor has he, as of this writing, dismissed Secretary of Veterans Affairs Eric Shinseki, despite widespread problems in the VA that are ballooning into a damaging scandal.

If Obama gave Shinseki his walking papers, it would be out of character for this president. Except for Gen. Stanley McChrystal, it is hard to think of any significant appointee shown the door during Obama’s first five years in office. (McChrystal was fired in June 2010 after his unflattering comments about the president surfaced in a Rolling Stone article.) Plenty of White House aides have cycled in and out, some perhaps nudged out the door, but “no-drama Obama” clearly does not like to make headlines with splashy sackings.

Is this a good or bad practice? Is a president better off “demonstrating tough leadership” and “holding people accountable” by dismissals, or should he stand behind his appointees?

Naturally, it depends on the situation—and more than public opinion is involved. Maybe the chief executive has had an irreparable breach with an adviser or there is an unresolvable policy dispute. Better to send a Cabinet member packing than let a sore fester.

The purely political questions are different, of course. What effect do firings have on public opinion? Does it help a president’s job approval when he shakes up his team? Is there a pattern in history that can be detected, at least since polling began?

Turns out, there are several trends worth noting. I examined the most prominent firings from Harry Truman to Barack Obama and tried to see what, if any, effect showed up in subsequent Gallup surveys. What I found was that delivering a prominent pink slip usually had only a minor impact on a president’s popularity, even short-term. Moreover, the polling result for the president was more likely to be negative than positive.

Take a look below at 35 cases of significant changes in presidential administrations where press reports made clear the departures were not voluntary. Even to political junkies, some of these events will be obscure, but at the time, the firings made front-page headlines and seemed very important. The inclusion of some dismissals involved judgment calls as to whether or not they were truly “firings.” (Have we forgotten any? Let us know at goodpolitics@virginia.edu.)

On the political Richter scale, probably the most earth-shaking were President Truman’s firing of Gen. Douglas MacArthur for insubordination during the Korean War in 1951, President Nixon’s Watergate-related dismissals of aides Bob Haldeman, John Ehrlichman and John Dean in the spring of 1973 and his follow-up beheading of Watergate special prosecutor Archibald Cox in the autumn. Truman’s decision, while judged correct by historians and military analysts, cost him whatever thin chance he had at reelection in 1952. Nixon’s surgical strikes were designed to save his presidency but, along with the White House tapes, helped make him the first president to resign.
