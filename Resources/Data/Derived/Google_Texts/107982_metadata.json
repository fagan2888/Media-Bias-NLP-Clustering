But his birthday guest list shows that he is no ordinary preacher. He is a cultural icon, the most famous face of traditional Protestant Christianity.\n\n\u201cWe need Billy Graham's message to be heard, I think, today more than ever,\" former vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin told the crowd.\n\nMORE ON CNN: Billy Graham turns 95 at star-studded birthday\n\nWhat, exactly, is that message\u2014and what accounts for its mass appeal? Now that Billy is 95, I wonder: is there anyone who can fill his shoes?\n\nGraham rose to success in the God-fearing years of the early Cold War. In 1949, the year of Graham\u2019s first big revival in Los Angeles, President Harry Truman told Americans that \u201cthe basic source of our strength as a nation is spiritual. ... Religious faith and religious work must be our reliance as we strive to fulfill our destiny in the world.\u201d\n\nFive years later, Congress added the words \u201cunder God\u201d to the Pledge of Allegiance. By the end of the decade, 65% of Americans belonged to a religious institution, and 90% told pollsters they believed in God and the power of prayer: they were ready to hearken to Graham\u2019s call.\n\nTall, handsome, \u201clike Gabriel in a gabardine suit\u201d according to Time magazine, Graham appealed to Americans\u2019 hunger for spiritual direction.\n\nHis sermons contained just the right mix of patriotism and reproof. He urged Americans to stand strong against \u201cgodless communism\u201d but also criticized American hubris.\n\n\u201cWe have an idea that we Americans are God's chosen people, that God loves us more than any other people, and that we are God's blessed,\u201d he told an audience in Charlotte, North Carolina in 1958. \u201cI tell you that God doesn't love us any more than He does the Russians.\u201d\n\nGraham urged his listeners to acknowledge their sins and embrace Christ; to quit making excuses and go to church. But he abandoned the strict fundamentalism of his youth for a less doctrinaire theology.\n\nHis crusades mobilized hundreds of volunteers from local churches\u2014not just evangelical churches, but liberal Protestant and Roman Catholic parishes as well.\n\nGraham had plenty of theological quarrels with these collaborators.\n\nHe accepted the assistance of New York Catholics during his crusade there in 1957, but three years later he helped organize Protestant ministers to oppose John F. Kennedy\u2019s presidential campaign.\n\nHowever, when it came to evangelism, he was a broad-minded pragmatist - outraging hard-line fundamentalists, who demanded strict separation from other Christians.\n\nHe replied to his critics: \u201cThe one badge of Christian discipleship is not orthodoxy but love. Christians are not limited to any church. The only question is: are you committed to Christ?\"\n\nOne member of Graham\u2019s circle coined the term \u201cneo-evangelical\u201d to describe this attitude. They were all conservative evangelicals who had left fundamentalism to lead a revival of both the soul and the mind. They formed the National Association of Evangelicals to unite conservative Protestants. In 1956 they founded the magazine Christianity Today, an \u201cevangelical, theologically oriented\u201d alternative to liberal periodicals, Graham wrote.\n\nSecular journalists quoted Graham as a capable spokesman for the evangelical point of view. Graham\u2019s visits to the White House gave the impression that he was a Protestant pope, possessing Christian wisdom and a valuable imprimatur. Graham seemed to represent an American evangelical consensus.\n\nBut from the beginning, this consensus was more apparent than real.\n\nFar more conservative Protestants stayed out of the National Association of Evangelicals than joined up. They thought of themselves as Baptists or Mennonites first, and \u201cevangelical\u201d second, if at all.\n\nSome evangelicals rejected the idea that Christians must experience the radical \u201cborn-again experience\u201d at the heart of Graham\u2019s crusades: they believed that conversion is sometimes slow and incremental. Others objected to the conservative politics of Graham and his colleagues.\n\nI have spent the past few years researching the stories of these different evangelical communities, ranging from pacifist Mennonites to tongues-speaking Pentecostals. I found that even if they disagreed with Billy Graham, they had no choice but to take him seriously.\n\nThey often defined their own beliefs against his ministry. Graham and other neo-evangelicals helped other Christians understand themselves more clearly. As a result, the fissures and tensions that have always divided the evangelical world are deeper than ever.\n\nBilly Graham has no successor.\n\nIn today\u2019s age of fragmented evangelicalism and social media-savvy churches, there is no individual who can represent American evangelicalism to the world. Every believer has his own favorite Christian blog, her own like-minded Twitter network. And evangelicalism\u2019s golden age seems to be ending. The biggest denominations, booming during the height of Graham\u2019s career, are now stagnating or losing members.\n\nGraham\u2019s career ranged well beyond American shores, and conservative Protestantism is flourishing in the Global South. Some evangelists there command crowds that rival or exceed Graham\u2019s biggest crusades. For more than 50 years, the German evangelist Reinhard Bonnke has preached throughout Africa to audiences that range in the hundreds of thousands.\n\nBut evangelists making their careers in non-Western societies face different challenges than Graham did. They are trying to reach people who worry not about the threat of secular liberalism, but the fate of their unbaptized ancestors or witchcraft in their villages. In the Global South, the label \u201cevangelical\u201d implies similarities to American religion that don\u2019t exist.\n\nBilly Graham may be an icon of an era that has passed, a Christian coalition that was never as harmonious as it seemed.\n\nHis own message, however, remains the same. In his message on Thursday \u2014perhaps his final sermon \u2014 he warned that \u201cour country is in great need of a spiritual awakening.\u201d\n\nMolly Worthen is an assistant professor of history at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and the author of \"Apostles of Reason: The Crisis of Authority in American Evangelicalism.\"", "article_metadata": {"description": "Opinion by Molly Worthen, special to CNN (CNN)\u00a0-- Under ordinary circumstances, Donald Trump and Rupert Murdoch are probably not in the habit of attending the birthday parties of elderly Christian preachers in the North Carolina mountains.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "title": "How Billy Graham became an American icon", "og": {"url": "http://religion.blogs.cnn.com/2013/11/09/how-billy-graham-became-an-american-icon/", "image": "http://i.cdn.turner.com/cnn/.element/img/3.0/sect/blogs/fb/belief.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Opinion by Molly Worthen, special to CNN\r\n\r\n(CNN)\u00a0-- Under ordinary circumstances, Donald Trump and Rupert Murdoch are probably not in the habit of attending the birthday parties of elderly Christian preachers in the North Carolina mountains.", "title": "How Billy Graham became an American icon"}, "msvalidate.01": "DE341CAC7D45B696ED1776216C18054C", "fb": {"admins": 690014395, "app_id": 80401312489}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "application-name": "CNN Belief Blog", "keywords": "belief, billy graham, christianity, evangelicals, leaders, opinion, billy graham, christianity, evangelicalism, evangelicals, harry truman, molly worthen, protestantism, rupert murdoch, sarah palin", "google-site-verification": "mFBa4OnyEDU23vgVJ6rtX_4izud7FIi9JiscfVsWaKk", "original-source": "http://religion.blogs.cnn.com/2013/11/09/how-billy-graham-became-an-american-icon/", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://religion.blogs.cnn.com/feed/;icon-uri=https://s2.wp.com/i/favicon.ico"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb706\"", "article_summary": "MORE ON CNN: Billy Graham turns 95 at star-studded birthdayWhat, exactly, is that message\u2014and what accounts for its mass appeal?\nI found that even if they disagreed with Billy Graham, they had no choice but to take him seriously.\nBut they were both among the hundreds of well-wishers at the party on Thursday marking Billy Graham\u2019s 95th birthday.\nBilly Graham may be an icon of an era that has passed, a Christian coalition that was never as harmonious as it seemed.\n\u201cWe need Billy Graham's message to be heard, I think, today more than ever,\" former vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin told the crowd."}
