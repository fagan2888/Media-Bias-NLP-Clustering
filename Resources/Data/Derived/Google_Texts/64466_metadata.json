On Oct. 4, NBC will air the Season 25 episode with Christopher Walken as the host and Christina Aguilera as the musical guest. You might remember those two episodes for their iconic sketches: Pryor\u2019s infamous \u201cWord Association\u201d sketch, and Walken\u2019s oft-quoted \u201cCowbell\u201d sketch.\n\nBecause comedy is so subjective, and because \u201cSNL\u2019s\u201d repertoire is so vast, it\u2019s hard to guess the exact episodes that \u201cSNL\u201d will air. But we have a few requests. Here are the eight iconic episodes we\u2019d like to see in the \u201cVintage\u201d series:\n\nSteve Martin/The Blues Brothers (Season 3, Episode 18)\n\nThis Emmy-nominated episode from 1978 is an \u201cSNL\u201d classic for so many reasons: It cemented Steve Martin\u2019s role as one of the show\u2019s best hosts ever (by this episode, he\u2019d already hosted five times in 18 months). It also notes the the success of \u201cSNL\u201d in pop culture, inviting \u201cSNL\u2019s\u201d own Blues Brothers as the musical guest, and premiering Martin\u2019s single, \u201cKing Tut.\u201d Other classic sketches from this episode: \u201cPoint/Counterpoint\u201d with Dan Aykroyd and Jane Curtin, and Martin\u2019s Monty Python-like \u201cTheodoric of York, Medieval Barber.\u201d\n\nEddie Murphy/Robert Plant & the Honeydrippers (Season 10, Episode 9)\n\nFormer \u201cSNL\u201d cast member Eddie Murphy, who famously hosted \u201cSNL\u201d in Season 8 while still a cast member, returned to host the show without controversy in 1984 after his departure. This episode not only celebrated his homecoming, but it also featured the classic sketch \u201cWhite Like Me.\u201d\n\nSigourney Weaver/Buster Poindexter (Season 12, Episode 1)\n\nThe 1986\u201387 season was a historic and tumultuous one for for \u201cSNL\u201d: After near-cancellation and a serious gutting of the show, the fate of \u201cSNL\u201d seemed uncertain. Five out of the nine performers were brand new and relatively unknown to American audiences: Dana Carvey, Phil Hartman, Jan Hooks, Victoria Jackson and Kevin Nealon. In the premiere episode we met Mr. Subliminal, Bill Franklin and Derek Stevens. In the midst of \u201cSNL\u2019s\u201d current shake-up, this episode is a reminder of the show\u2019s resilience, iconic status and ability to poke fun at itself.", "article_metadata": {"description": "NBC is celebrating 40 years by airing classic episodes.
