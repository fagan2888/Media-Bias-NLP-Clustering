(Photo: Joe Raedle/Getty Images)\n\nNearly two years after most of the provisions of the Affordable Care Act went into effect, the number of Americans who are uninsured continues to fall, according to a new government survey.\n\nBetween January and September 2015, about nine percent of Americans didn\u2019t have health insurance, according to the National Center for Health Statistics. Previously, the same survey had found the percentage of uninsured Americans fell from 20 to 18 between 2013 and 2014. Other surveys have gathered roughly similar figures.\n\nLooking at the number of Americans covered by health insurance is just one way to judge whether the ACA is working. Other considerations include: Whether Obamacare reduces health-care spending in the United States, whether it makes insurance cheaper for most people, and whether it makes Americans healthier as a whole. On these measures, the ACA\u2019s track record is mixed. Because the new report is just about the newly insured, however, we\u2019ll focus on that.\n\nHere are the top three lessons to take away from the latest analysis:\n\nSince the passage of the ACA, uninsured rates fell most sharply for some of those Americans in the greatest need, including low-income folks and minorities. Black and Hispanic Americans remain the most likely to be uninsured, however. (Asian Americans\u2019 insurance rates fell below whites\u2019 in 2015.)\n\n\n\nIn addition, the number of poor American adults who don\u2019t have health insurance remains high: more than one in four. Poor children fare better, with an uninsured rate of 4.4 percent, and a steep decline in uninsured rates between 2010 and 2015.\n\n(Chart: National Center for Health Statistics)\n\n(Chart: National Center for Health Statistics)\n\nStates that invest in their own health insurance marketplaces \u2014 instead of relying on the federal government\u2019s \u2014 cover more of their people.\n\nThe effects of the ACA varied a lot between states. The act was originally designed to work alongside an expansion of Medicaid to cover more low-income Americans, but after a 2012 Supreme Court decision made expansion optional, 19 states have decided against it. In those states, about one in six people are uninsured, versus one in 10 in states that expanded Medicare, the report finds. That\u2019s a problem: Adults in this so-called coverage gap tend to be working poor and \u201chave limited, if any, option for affordable health coverage,\u201d the Kaiser Family Foundation reports.\n\nOverall, it looks like Obamacare is working to cover more Americans, including many of the neediest. Still, gaps remain, especially in those states that are resisting the act the most.\n\nQuick Studies is an award-winning series that sheds light on new research and discoveries that change the way we look at the world.", "article_metadata": {"description": "by Francie Diep \u00b6\n\nNearly two years after most of the provisions of the Affordable Care Act went into effect, the number of Americans who are uninsured con\u2026", "title": "Is Obamacare Working? \u2014 Pacific Standard", "og": {"site_name": "Medium", "description": "by Francie Diep \u00b6\n\nNearly two years after most of the provisions of the Affordable Care Act went into effect, the number of Americans who are uninsured con\u2026", "title": "Is Obamacare Working? \u2014 Pacific Standard", "url": "https://psmag.com/is-obamacare-working-49021fa05991", "image": "https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/0*a8WlSBIlUtMBB6LL.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "always", "twitter": {"creator": "@franciediep", "label1": "Reading time", "image": {"src": "https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/0*a8WlSBIlUtMBB6LL.jpg"}, "site": "@Medium", "data1": "2 mins", "app": {"url": {"iphone": "medium://p/49021fa05991"}, "name": {"iphone": "Medium"}, "id": {"iphone": 828256236}}, "card": "summary"}, "author": "Francie Diep", "al": {"web": {"url": "https://psmag.com/is-obamacare-working-49021fa05991"}, "android": {"url": "medium://p/49021fa05991", "app_name": "Medium", "package": "com.medium.reader"}, "ios": {"url": "medium://p/49021fa05991", "app_name": "Medium", "app_store_id": 828256236}}, "fb": {"app_id": 542599432471018, "smart_publish": {"robots": "noauto"}}, "theme-color": "#000000", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/medium", "published_time": "2016-02-15T16:00:00.000Z", "author": "https://psmag.com/@franciediep"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe17ed\"", "article_summary": "Is Obamacare Working?\nPreviously, the same survey had found the percentage of uninsured Americans fell from 20 to 18 between 2013 and 2014.\nOverall, it looks like Obamacare is working to cover more Americans, including many of the neediest.\nLooking at the number of Americans covered by health insurance is just one way to judge whether the ACA is working.\nBetween January and September 2015, about nine percent of Americans didn\u2019t have health insurance, according to the National Center for Health Statistics."}
