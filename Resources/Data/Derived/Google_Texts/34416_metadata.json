LOUIS \u2014In the wake of the Rockies\u2019 stunning trade of Troy Tulowitzki to the Toronto Blue Jays, we\u2019re left with so many questions, so few answers.\n\nThis much we do know: This season is another bust. The Rockies are careening down a path toward a 93-loss season, which, in a mathematical sort of way, is in balance. The Rockies have averaged 93 losses over the past four seasons.\n\nThat leads to an overriding question: When will the Rockies field a contending baseball team again?\n\nFirst-year general manager Jeff Bridich was asked that question during a conference call Friday. He danced around it, as front-office types are prone to do.\n\n\u201cCan we marry that wave of pitching with some of the young talent on offense and start to be competitive and start to play meaningful games in August and September?\u201d Bridich said. \u201cThat was the goal this year. Can we do that next year if things work out? I do believe that we can.\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t. Optimistically, I think 2017 provides a glimmer of light at the end of the tunnel.\n\nThat leads to the next question: Can the Rockies fix their problems on the mound during the same window when there is talent on the field? There is some hope. Top prospect Jon Gray, still serving his apprenticeship at Triple-A Albuquerque, is the real deal. Right-hander Chad Bettis \u2014 knock on wood that his elbow inflammation is not the beginning of something serious \u2014 has shown toughness and an effective variety of pitches. Right-hander Eddie Butler continues to tease us with talent and frustrate us with inconsistency.\n\nRight-hander Tyler Chatwood, coming back from his second Tommy John surgery, still has chance to be a No. 4 or No. 5 pitcher, but coming back twice from T.J. surgery creates doubt.\n\nRighty Jeff Hoffman, acquired in the Tulo deal, was the ninth overall pick in 2014 draft. He\u2019s pitching at Double-A, but he\u2019s not that far from being major-league ready. Hoffman probably would have been selected earlier in the draft but was recovering from Tommy John following a successful season at East Carolina. He owns a good changeup that pairs well with a heavy, two-seam fastball he throws in the mid-90s. He fits the Rockies\u2019 pitching template.\n\nRELATED: Jorge De La Rosa turns in solid start in Rockies\u2019 6-2 victory over St. Louis\n\nOf course, my glowing mini-synopsis of Colorado\u2019s talent must be tempered by the organization\u2019s dismal record at developing its own pitching.\n\nBridich, a smart and forward-thinking man, has drawn up his blueprint for the Rockies\u2019 future. That became clear when he persuaded owner Dick Monfort to part with Tulo. So how\u2019s he doing so far? I think it\u2019s too early to tell.\n\nOne thing is certain, he has changed the mentality of the franchise. Monfort was too emotionally attached to star players like Tulo. Bridich, who approaches his job with a businesslike demeanor, established precedent to cut those ties.\n\n\u201cFor (Bridich) to be successful, he has to be able to make trades he thinks he has to make,\u201d a teary-eyed Monfort said last week as Bridich officially announced that Tulowitzki was been shipped north of the border.\n\nThat leads to another question: How are the Rockies dealing with Tulo\u2019s departure? On the field, they are a lesser team. New shortstop Jose Reyes has his attributes, but he\u2019s no Tulo.\n\nIn the clubhouse, I don\u2019t think Tulowitzki\u2019s departure will have a huge impact, except on Nolan Arenado, who had grown very close to his former infield mate. It\u2019s no secret that Tulo\u2019s tunnel vision approach to his craft means he runs in a tight circle.\n\nHaving said that, the manner in which Tulowitzki was traded left a number of Rockies players wary and less trusting of the organization. There is a feeling, by some, that the club\u2019s notion of creating a Rockies \u201cfamily\u201d rings hollow. There are some hard feelings that need to be patched up on a team that\u2019s searching for an identity.\n\nPatrick Saunders: psaunders@denverpost.com or twitter.com/psaundersdp\n\nSpotlight on \u2026\n\nNelson Cruz, designated hitter, Mariners\n\nWhat\u2019s up: The Rockies have seen their fair share of American League sluggers pass through Coors Field this season, including the Angels\u2019 Mike Trout and Albert Pujols. Now Seattle\u2019s Cruz arrives with a chance to see how far his missiles fly at 5,280 feet.\n\nBackground: Cruz, for a long time one of the best sluggers in the majors, went 4-for-5 with a double, a homer and two RBIs in the Mariners\u2019 6-1 victory at Minnesota on Friday. It was his first four-hit day since September of last season. Entering Saturday, Cruz had hit in 11th consecutive games, during which he batted .400 with six home runs. Cruz\u2019s homer Friday was his 27th, tying him for sixth in the majors. At age 35, Cruz is having one of the best seasons of his career.\n\nSaunders\u2019 take: The Mariners are an enigma. They were picked by many, including me, to compete for the American League West title. But they entered Saturday\u2019s play 10 games under .500 and 11 games behind the division-leading Astros. Ace Felix Hernandez has been good but erratic at times. Robinson Cano, now battling a pulled abdominal muscle, was having a subpar season until he got hot in July. Cruz, however, has cruised most of the season. His power had lagged a bit \u2014 just one homer in July \u2014 until he tweaked his stance. Manager Lloyd McClendon said recently that he expected Cruz to break out \u201cany day now.\u201d He was right. Cruz is hot, hitting with power to all fields, which makes him especially dangerous at Coors Field.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Saunders: Rockies still trying to forge an identity after Troy Tulowitzki trade", "title": "Saunders: Rockies still trying to forge an identity after Troy Tulowitzki trade", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/08/01/saunders-rockies-still-trying-to-forge-an-identity-after-troy-tulowitzki-trade/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150721_123148_jeff-bridich.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150721_123148_jeff-bridich.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-08-01T23:58:06+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-05-23T02:43:47+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Patrick Saunders"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcbe72\"", "article_summary": "That leads to an overriding question: When will the Rockies field a contending baseball team again?\nST.
