Count Rep. Charlie Rangel (D-N.Y.) among those appearing unimpressed with President Barack Obama's apology over the Affordable Care Act's shaky rollout.

Hours after Obama unveiled a fix for the hundreds of thousands of health insurance plans canceled as a result of the new law, Rangel ripped into the president's attempt to take responsibility for errors affecting people across the country.

“If I had the problem, saying you’re sorry doesn’t help me worth a damn at the polls, unless I can staple your remarks to the ballot,” Rangel told the New York Daily News on Thursday.

Rangel has been among the Democrats who have defended Obamacare in the public eye. One of his more intense moments doing so was a late September showdown with Rep. Michele Bachmann (R-Minn.) on CNN's "Crossfire."

"You’re a lawyer and you’re a lawmaker and you know it is impossible to repeal a law by making it a poison pill in something that tears down the government," said Rangel. "You know that!”

On Friday, 39 House Democrats rebuked Obama by voting for a GOP-sponsored bill that would give insurers the ability to keep selling plans even if they fall short of Obamacare standards. Rangel was not one of those defecting Democrats.
