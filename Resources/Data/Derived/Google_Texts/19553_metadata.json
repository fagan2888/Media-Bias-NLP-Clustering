Last summer, he was the first of the Americans held hostage by ISIS to be murdered, his beheading recorded in a horrific video seen worldwide.\n\nMichael Foley contends that Times articles portrayed his brother inaccurately \u2014 particularly when they depicted him as an enthusiastic convert to Islam and as someone who had been repeatedly waterboarded and routinely beaten. He also takes issue with the description of American and British hostages being singled out for extra abuse. Those things aren\u2019t true, he says, and The Times should correct the record.\n\nMichael Foley said that his own inquiry, which included his speaking to former ISIS hostages, had found that his brother, a Catholic, did not truly convert but acted under pressure from his captors; and also that he had been waterboarded only once and not singled out for excessive abuse.\n\nLater in the column, Sullivan notes:\n\nAfter editors heard Mr. Foley\u2019s complaint, The Times did a deeper dive into the question of religious conversions. A resulting story, by Jim Yardley, was not intended as a corrective, [international editor Joseph] Kahn said, but as an amplification of the intriguing topic of religious conversions of Western hostages. Mr. Foley told me Mr. Yardley\u2019s piece did not satisfy him.\n\n\u201cIt didn\u2019t get to the heart of my issue, which is that the original reporting wasn\u2019t accurate,\u201d he told me.\n\nConcerning James Foley's reported conversion, the public editor concludes:\n\nTo some extent in articles like this, uncontested truth is bound to be elusive. Did a hostage in fear for his life make a genuine religious conversion or was he simply under duress? And was he singled out for unusually cruel treatment? It\u2019s impossible to know. Given that, the stories\u2019 pervasive tone of certainty \u2014 reporting, for example, that Mr. Foley was \u201ccaptivated by Islam\u201d \u2014 may have been unwarranted.\n\nMay have been unwarranted?\n\nAs a faithful GetReligion reader who emailed us put it, \"If it's impossible to know, then there's no may have been about it.\"\n\nMichael Foley is right: It's past time for the Times to issue a formal correction on its original report.", "article_metadata": {"description": "\"Is it a fact?\"\r\n\r\nThat was\u00a0the simple question GetReligion asked\u00a0back in October after\u00a0The \r\nNew York Times\u00a0reported that Islamic State beheading victim James Foley \u2014\u00a0\r\nan avowed Catholic\u00a0\u2014 made a \"sincere\" conversion to Islam before his death.\r\n\r\nFour months later,\u00a0we revisited the issue\u00a0when the\u00a0Times\u00a0produced an \r\nin-depth piece seriously exploring Foley's faith and asking many of the \r\nquestions that its first story failed to acknowledge.
