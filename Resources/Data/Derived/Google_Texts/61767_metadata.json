Getty Images\n\nBRUSSELS\u2014ONE OF THE inherent absurdities of being an expat is celebrating traditional events from back home with more enthusiasm than you ever did while you lived there. An informal straw poll of British friends confirmed my suspicion that none of us knew when the Queen\u2019s official birthday was when we lived in the U.K. Now I can easily tell you it\u2019s a Saturday in June \u2013 the perfect excuse for Pimm\u2019s and canap\u00e9s at the embassy.\n\nAnother example is Burns Night, held every year on Jan. 25 to honor Scotland\u2019s national poet, Robert Burns. Even if you\u2019re not remotely Scottish, who can resist reading a poem to a haggis, drinking Scotch whisky and admiring chaps in kilts? Not your correspondent.\n\nIf the food\u2019s not to your taste, there\u2019s always the dancing: at a ceilidh (pronounced kay-lee) the caller will talk you through the steps before you all dance through the moves in beautiful formation. Throwing a language barrier into this process is always fun as well \u2013 I once went to a ceilidh at the College of Europe where the enthusiastic dancing, Belgian beer and obscure dance terminology led to more international collisions than CERN. There are expat Burns Nights from Budapest to Dubai happening this weekend, or, if you\u2019re planning your own party, here are some handy pointers.\n\nHaggis\n\nYou\u2019re probably too late to order one, though Jack O\u2019Shea\u2019s can get them for you in Brussels. If you\u2019re feeling brave enough to buy a lot of offal, there\u2019s a recipe here, with the ominous-sounding introduction \u201cThis is an authentic recipe from Scotland and the ingredients and methods of cooking may be unfamiliar but we hope you enjoy the results.\u201d Or, give it an expat twist: this Scottish-Chinese Burns Night in Canadainvolves \u201cBonnie Wee Things\u201d or Haggis wontons. However, sad news for expatriate Scots in the U.S.: Haggis is still banned, despite this Braveheart-style plea by Scottish Rural Affairs Secretary Richard Lochhead in 2011 and decades of lobbying by U.S. meat-lovers. That\u2019s because sheep\u2019s lungs \u2013 an essential part of the stuffing \u2013 are banned under U.S. import rules. Some enterprising Scots have smuggled them in, according to reports (pity the people who sat next to them on the plane). Others hope the issue can be resolved as part of the EU-US trade deal, known as the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership.\n\nDrinks\n\nObviously, whisky. The Scotch Whisky Association notes that Rabbie Burns\u2019s day job was being a tax man, making a romantic evening of poetry and celebration into a chance to lobby for lower taxes on single malts. They also have some tips on which ones are best to drink. Here are some wine recommendations, or Scottish brewery Belhaven have a Robert Burns Ale.\n\nPoetry\n\nThe centerpiece of a good Burns Night is addressing the haggis, \u201cGreat chieftain o\u2019 the pudding-race!\u201d You could show off and do it in Russian, like this guy. But what if you can\u2019t remember how the poem goes, or you want to regale your guests with more Scots verse after you\u2019ve done the big number for the main course? There\u2019s an official app for that, made by Scotland.org, which can be downloaded free here.\n\nREAD MORE: Pecan Pie in Singapore?
