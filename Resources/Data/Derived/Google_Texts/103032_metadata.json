They told me don\u2019t do anything, you just stay back. That situation, I\u2019m a little worried.\u201d\n\nGoldwater also appeared on a NBC News segment back on October:\n\n\u201cI\u2019m completely overwhelmed with a six-month-old and a business,\u201d said Goldwater. \u201cThe last thing I can do is spend hours poring over a website that isn\u2019t working, trying to wrap my head around this entire health care overhaul.\u201d\n\nGoldwater said she supports the new law and is grateful for provisions helping folks like her with pre-existing conditions, but she worries she won\u2019t be able to afford the new insurance, which is expected to cost more because it has more benefits. \u201cI\u2019m jealous of people who have really good health insurance,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s people like me who are stuck in the middle who are going to get screwed.\u201d\n\nHowever, there is much more information about this Obamacare \"disaster story\" not reported by CNBC or NBC News.\n\nMediaite.com reports that the Cigna letter, with health plan options, that Goldwater was supposed to get, has been delayed in five states, but will be mailed between November 10 and November 15.\n\nApparently, there are also several plans on the Obamacare exchange website that are cheaper than Goldwater's $510 per month and will include \"essential services\" such as maternity (Goldwater paid almost $16,000 out of pocket in 2013) and prescriptions.\n\n\n\n\u201cI definitely believe there should be healthcare reform and honestly, I\u2019m glad the reform is happening,\u201d Goldwater told Mediaite.com. \"I\u2019m not blaming the president because of this and of course there\u2019s going to be problems in the beginning when you change. You have millions of Americans scrambling to one website\u2026 you should expect the thing to crash. It\u2019s like everyone trying to get on one subway. It\u2019s just not going to happen right away.\"\n\nSources: CrooksandLiars.com, Mediaite.com, NBC News", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#0e0e0e", "p": {"domain_verify": "4e3a17d2b19ae614286124438d4e37ce"}, "description": "Heather Goldwater, a PR professional, recently told CNBC's", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "title": "NBC News, CNBC's Obamacare Horror Story is Debunked (Video)", "modernizr-version": "2.8.3", "foundation-version": "5.4.7", "jquery-version": "2.1.1", "og": {"url": "http://www.opposingviews.com/i/health/health-care/nbc-news-cnbcs-obamacare-horror-story-debunked-video", "image": "https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/ov-file-archive/piece/4/4/704004.0.HeatherGoldwater.png", "type": "article", "description": "Heather Goldwater, a PR professional, recently told CNBC's", "title": "NBC News, CNBC's Obamacare Horror Story is Debunked (Video)"}, "DC.date.issued": "2013-11-07T00:36:44+00:00", "theme-version": "1.2.4", "publish_date": "2013-11-07T00:36:44+00:00", "msapplication-TileImage": "/sites/all/themes/ov_foundation/img/favicons/ms-icon-144x144.png", "theme-color": "#0e0e0e", "ov": {"id": 841384}, "viewport": "width=device-width, maximum-scale = 1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8cf2\"", "article_summary": "Heather Goldwater, a PR professional, recently told CNBC's \"Closing Bell\" how her $510-a-month health insurance plan was canceled by Cigna.\nCigna promised to send Goldwater a letter with more health plan options, but has failed to do so.\n\u201cI definitely believe there should be healthcare reform and honestly, I\u2019m glad the reform is happening,\u201d Goldwater told Mediaite.com.\nDuring the segment, CNBC aired a scary graphic that read: \"May Double \u2013 After Obamacare\" (video below).\n\u201cI\u2019m jealous of people who have really good health insurance,\u201d she said."}
