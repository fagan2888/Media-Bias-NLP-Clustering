A Wichita church is starting a new tradition of its own this Thanksgiving. Gracepoint Church is providing meals for those on the clock.

Over the past two days, hundreds filled the church to make 500 meals for Wichitans missing Thanksgiving dinner with friends and family.

In a true team effort by volunteers, bags were filled with turkey, stuffing, pumpkin bars and more for 'Operation Turkey Sandwich.'

It's a mission to spread meals across the city to give workers a taste of what they're missing.

"We're going to head to some liquor stores, gas stations, some bars and stores," said youth pastor and volunteer Kristen Poljansek.

Poljansek and her friend were two of the volunteers hitting the wet roads to make a difference.

"Just kind of a thanks for working and giving back and giving your time on this holiday," Poljansek said to a Dollar General cashier as she handed over a meal.

The crew stopped at every open business on their 8 mile route.

For the employees they found, Thanksgiving comes with perspective.

"It's a blessing to have a job so people can come in and pick up things that they need," said Walmart assistant manager Tonya Tiller.

But it's a gesture that caught those on the receiving end by surprise.

"It makes me feel really blessed to know that someone else really cares." said Tiller.

For the volunteers who gave up time with those who matter most, giving thanks to people they've never met provides a rewarding gift.

"It just felt good to be able to give to them and then seeing their hearts filled with joy with just even a turkey sandwich," said Poljansek.

Gracepoint Church employees say they doubled their goal for meals this year and plan to do the same next year with 1000 meals for Wichitans working the holiday.
