Ann Kirkpatrick and Ron Barber would run for a week at a cost of about $200,000. Americans for Prosperity, a conservative advocacy nonprofit, has already dropped a total of $650,000 against the two Arizona incumbents this year.\n\nOverall, since September 2013, Americans for Prosperity has spent an estimated $20 million on television ads targeting House and Senate Democrats for their support of the Affordable Care Act. On Wednesday, The New York Times noted that the response from Democratic-affiliated PACs and other outside groups has been limited so far.\n\nThe ad supporting Kirkpatrick, titled \u201cListens,\u201d will run in Phoenix. Interestingly enough, it mentions the Affordable Care Act but with a slightly critical tone.\n\n\"It\u2019s here, in small towns and wide-open places, that Ann Kirkpatrick listens and learns. It's why she blew the whistle on the disastrous health care website, calling it 'stunning ineptitude,' and worked to fix it,\" the narrator says. \"She fought to hold insurance companies accountable, so they can't deny coverage for pre-existing conditions or drop coverage when you get sick.\"\n\nKirkpatrick is shown walking with constituents wearing cowboy hats and sitting on a haystack in a horse barn with a small child.\n\nThree Republicans are vying to challenge her, including Arizona state House Speaker Andy Tobin.\n\nThe commercial for Barber is called \u201cBillionaires\u201d and will run in Tucson. It takes on the Koch brothers directly and targets retired Air Force Col. Martha McSally, a Republican looking to unseat Barber.\n\n\"Seen these ads? They're paid for by out-of-state billionaires who are pushing a reckless agenda that eliminates the minimum wage and privatizes Social Security. That's why they're supporting Martha McSally,\" the narrator says.\n\nThe ads ends with the narrator saying, \u201cMartha McSally: She\u2019s really not for you.\"\n\nLevi Russell, a spokesman for Americans for Prosperity, responded to the Democratic ads in a statement: \u201cIt would be refreshing to see Representatives Kirkpatrick and Barber be honest and upfront about the impact of [the Affordable Care Act], rather than attack and demonize those who are speaking out.\u201d\n\nRelated on HuffPost: New House Members Of The 113th Congress New House Members Of The 113th Congress\n\n1 of 84 Rep.
