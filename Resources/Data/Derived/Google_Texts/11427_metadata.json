The symbol of her protest against Paul Nungesser now sits in her parents\u2019 living room, according to Vulture.\n\nWhat\u2019s next for the mattress? Sulkowicz hopes a museum might buy it from her:\n\nShe herself told the Times on Class Day: \u201cIf some sort of museum wants to buy it, then I\u2019m open to that. But I\u2019m not going to just throw it away.\u201d\n\nHers would not be the first mattress to take up residence in an art museum, according to Vulture:\n\nMany have noted that Mattress Performance resonates with historically weighty works by Vito Acconci, Tehching Hsieh, and Marina Abramovic. And these days, props from performances by Acconci, Hsieh, and Abramovic are displayed in museums and, in some cases, sold in galleries. Whatever its fate in art or social history, Mattress Performance could well live on in objecthood. But would a museum or gallery want it? On the phone from California, where she is visiting a friend in Laguna Beach post-graduation and luxuriating in the distance from the 50-pound mattress she hauled around daily since September, Sulkowicz says no one has approached her about the prospect yet. But the question is in the ether. \u201cI can definitely imagine it having a future,\u201d says Catherine Morris, curator of the Brooklyn Museum\u2019s Sackler Center for Feminist Art. \u201cWhat makes her work interesting and viable for the long term is its immediacy, but also, I think, her ability to understand how her work works within the context of art history.\u201d\n\nArt is open to interpretation. What this mattress represents\u2014perseverance in the wake of sexual violence, or calculated harassment\u2014is also open to interpretation, I suppose, depending upon whether one finds Sulkowicz\u2019s account more credible, or Nungesser\u2019s.\n\nSulkowicz wants us to see the mattress as a piece of art. But really, it\u2019s a piece of evidence in an alleged crime\u2014a crime of which Nungesser was cleared. As I\u2019ve written previously, I can\u2019t say for certain that he is innocent\u2014although recent developments point in that direction\u2014but it seems strange to keep praising Sulkowicz\u2019s antics as if her heroism is beyond doubt.\n\nIf a museum does buy her mattress, I hope the exhibit is a testament to the imperfections of the campus rape adjudication process, or perhaps a meditation on whether we can ever know for certain whether justice was done.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "What does her art represent?", "title": "Emma Sulkowicz Hopes Maybe a Museum Will Buy Her Mattress", "url": "http://reason.com/blog/2015/05/28/emma-sulkowicz-hopes-maybe-a-museum-will", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/1432843103985.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "What does her art represent?", "creator": "@robbysoave", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/1432843103985.jpg", "title": "Emma Sulkowicz Hopes Maybe a Museum Will Buy Her Mattress", "site": "@reason", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 17548474116}, "google-site-verification": "-AmMiilAN-pnjWt369CUWae-VQ-b9wmH4fSGyhbkQxw", "msvalidate.01": "212A68A07785B3080038A845C4EE8905", "article": {"tag": "Culture", "published_time": "2015-05-28T20:06:00+00:00", "author": "http://reason.com/people/robby-soave"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2"}, "article_summary": "Sulkowicz hopes a museum might buy it from her:She herself told the Times on Class Day: \u201cIf some sort of museum wants to buy it, then I\u2019m open to that.\nNow that she has graduated, Emma Sulkowicz is no longer bound by her promise to carry her mattress with her to class.\nSulkowicz wants us to see the mattress as a piece of art.\nWhatever its fate in art or social history, Mattress Performance could well live on in objecthood.\nIf a museum does buy her mattress, I hope the exhibit is a testament to the imperfections of the campus rape adjudication process, or perhaps a meditation on whether we can ever know for certain whether justice was done."}
