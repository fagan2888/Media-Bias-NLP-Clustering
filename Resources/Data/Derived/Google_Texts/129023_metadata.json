The site will be updating its moderator guidelines accordingly.\n\n\u201cIf the Internet was a dude, we\u2019d all agree that dude has a serious problem with women,\u201d site founder Drew Curtis wrote in a statement about the change, adding that \u201cthis represents enough of a departure from pretty much how every other large internet community operates that I figure an announcement is necessary.\u201d\n\nAlthough it\u2019s unclear how effective the new guidelines will be in practice on the overwhelmingly male site, Fark is garnering some praise for taking a stand against the issue of gender-based harassment and abuse. The move could also represent a step toward creating a healthier atmosphere on the internet.\n\nThese issues are sometimes written off as feminists whining or seeking to silence men. But there\u2019s actually evidence that failing to address this type of online abuse can have serious consequences for users\u2019 mental and physical health.\n\nWith the rise of the internet, there\u2019s also been a rise in concern for the people who are tasked with moderating disturbing content online. In 2012, Buzzfeed published the account of one of the employees responsible for dealing with \u201csensitive\u201d content for Google, like images of child pornography. \u201cI had no one to talk to,\u201d the tech worker explained. \u201cFor seven, eight, nine months, I was looking at this kind of stuff and thinking I was fine, but it was putting me in a really dark place.\u201d\n\nIn light of those issues, a trade group called the Online Safety and Technology Working Group released a report to Congress recommending that companies that employ people to moderate this content find ways to \u201caddress the psychological impact on employees of exposure to these disturbing images.\u201d\n\nThis is a problem in other professions where employees may routinely be exposed to disturbing content as part of their daily work, too. Multiple studies have found that reporters who sift through violent content \u2014 whether reader-submitted news tips, photos of major terror attacks, or images of natural disasters \u2014 can end up suffering from symptoms of depression, anxiety, and PTSD. Attorneys who deal with legal cases that involve similar graphic images, like the material accompanying gruesome sexual assault or murder cases, often suffer from similar mental health effects.\n\n\u201cDefinitely when you look at these images, you will have a stress reaction to that,\u201d Heather Steele, the director of The Innocent Justice Foundation, which runs training programs for police officers and prosecutors, recently told Fast Company. \u201cIt\u2019s not just whether you are a tough or not tough person. You will have a fight, flight, or freeze response, and chemicals will dump into your system.\u201d\n\nFark\u2019s policy change comes amid a larger conversation about sexist abuse on the internet. Just two weeks ago, staffers at the feminist site Jezebel announced they\u2019ve struggled to deal with a flood of violent rape imagery taking over their comment section. Jezebel\u2019s recent open letter noted that constantly being exposed to that misogynist content on the site posed a \u201cvery real and immediate threat to the mental health of Jezebel\u2019s staff and readers.\u201d Not long before that, the Guardian published a piece noting the \u201conline abuse that follows any article on women\u2019s issues,\u201d proposing that the internet needs to find some way to better moderate anonymous comments. Plus, a report released at the beginning of this month found that online misogyny is a serious barrier to the potential social good that can be furthered by internet technology.\n\nThe very specific types of misogynist abuse directed toward women on the internet can fuel real-life acts of violence as well that threaten their health, their safety, and even their lives. Deeply rooted misogyny cultivated in the so-called \u201cpick up artist\u201d community appeared to play some role in Elliot Rodger\u2019s recent shooting rampage in Santa Barbara that left seven people dead. In response to that tragedy, feminists pointed out that allowing these attitudes to flourish online contributes to the everyday violence and sexism that women constantly face.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "It's the latest installment in a bigger conversation about the abuse that women suffer online.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "It's the latest installment in a bigger conversation about the abuse that women suffer online.", "title": "Popular Website Bans Sexism", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/health/2014/08/22/3474537/public-health-internet-misogyny/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/shutterstock_142170193.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "It's the latest installment in a bigger conversation about the abuse that women suffer online.", "title": "Popular Website Bans Sexism", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/shutterstock_142170193-321x214.jpg", "creator": "@Tara_CR", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-health", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/shutterstock_142170193.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/shutterstock_142170193.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2014-08-22T09:48:59+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/tculpressler"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd85a4\"", "article_summary": "But there\u2019s actually evidence that failing to address this type of online abuse can have serious consequences for users\u2019 mental and physical health.\nWith the rise of the internet, there\u2019s also been a rise in concern for the people who are tasked with moderating disturbing content online.\nHealth Popular Website Bans Sexism CREDIT: ShutterstockThe online misogyny frequently leveled at women on the internet isn\u2019t a new issue, but the topic has been back at the news lately thanks to Fark, a prominent link aggregation community launched in 1999, that recently announced it will no longer allow misogyny in its online forums.\nIn response to that tragedy, feminists pointed out that allowing these attitudes to flourish online contributes to the everyday violence and sexism that women constantly face.\nPlus, a report released at the beginning of this month found that online misogyny is a serious barrier to the potential social good that can be furthered by internet technology."}
