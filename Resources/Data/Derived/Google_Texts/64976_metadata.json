Joe Garcia is no advocate for communism, but a Spanish-language TV ad takes a comment from Garcia out of context to make it appear that way.\n\nThe ad shows footage of Garcia, a Florida Democrat, saying that \u201cwe\u2019ve proved that communism works\u201d during a Google chat session about immigration. \u201cIf you give everybody a good government job, there\u2019s no crime,\u201d Garcia says in the ad.\n\nHowever, Garcia\u2019s full remarks show that he was actually taking a dig at Republicans for creating more government jobs by spending heavily on border security. Garcia can even be heard laughing as he makes the comment about communism leading to no crime.\n\nThe ad, from the conservative Hispanic group LIBRE Initiative, is part of a multimedia campaign, including TV and Web ads, that will air through the first three weeks of June.\n\nThe video ends with a viral clip of Garcia appearing to eat his own ear wax as the ad\u2019s narrator says: \u201cCall Congressman Garcia. Tell him to put his lunch aside and listen to the voice of the people. Communism doesn\u2019t work.\u201d\n\nBut here\u2019s what Garcia actually said about the GOP\u2019s approach to immigration:\n\nGarcia, May 20: Two of the safest cities in America, two of them are on the border with Mexico. And, of course, the reason is we\u2019ve proved that communism works. If you give everybody a good government job, there\u2019s no crime. But that isn\u2019t what we should be doing on the border. The kind of money we\u2019ve poured into it, and we\u2019re having diminishing returns. So while we\u2019re doing \u2014 we\u2019re spending all of this money here, we have border problems in Puerto Rico. Where we haven\u2019t been able to set up a system that\u2019s safe there. People are finding alternative routes. The opportunity to get this right and the mistake that Republicans make \u2014 and I say Republicans because it\u2019s Republicans right now \u2014 I\u2019m no one to say that Democrats were also possessed by xenophobia in 2008, and particularly after 9/11 and the economic crisis, but today we\u2019re in a much better place as a party. And the problem that Republicans have is that they\u2019re fighting a battle they cannot win.\n\nClearly, Garcia, in arguing against the U.S. border control strategy, was joking that \u201ccommunism works\u201d because it results in more government jobs and safer cities.\n\nIn fact, Garcia long has been an advocate for human rights in Communist nations such as Cuba. He was the executive director of the Cuban American National Foundation, which works to \u201cbring freedom and democracy to the Cuban people,\u201d according to the group\u2019s mission statement. And though he was once a supporter of the U.S. economic embargo on Cuba, Garcia features an Associated Press article on his congressional website that says he now believes that U.S. policy \u201churts Cuban citizens and dissidents in particular.\u201d\n\nIn response to criticism for his remark that \u201ccommunism works,\u201d Garcia told a Miami Herald reporter, \u201cThis is an absurdity, accusing the son of Cuban immigrants of believing in communism is just ridiculous.\u201d\n\nA day after the Google chat session, Garcia said in a May 21 interview with South Florida\u2019s NBC 6 that he doesn\u2019t believe that communism works. \u201cClearly I know that this is a system of government that is evil,\u201d Garcia told the news station.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time that the LIBRE Initiative has targeted Garcia. Earlier in the year, the group, which is run by Daniel Garza, a former aide to President George W. Bush, ran ads against Garcia for supporting the Affordable Care Act.\n\nGarcia, who represents the state\u2019s 26th Congressional District, is set to take on the winner of the Aug. 26 GOP primary, which features five contenders, including former Rep. David Rivera, who defeated Garcia in 2010 and then lost to Garcia in a rematch in 2012.\n\n\u2014 D\u2019Angelo Gore", "article_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd50f\"", "article_summary": "Rep.
