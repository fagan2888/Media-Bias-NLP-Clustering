Earlier this year, the Obama administration boasted that well over 11 million people had signed up for an ObamaCare plan by the end of the second open enrollment period.

Of course, “signing up” and “paying up” are two different things, which is why the 8 million-plus “sign-ups” Obama was bragging about at the start of last year had dwindled to 6.3 million by year’s end.

So now, the White House is saying that 10.2 million have “effectuated” coverage for 2015, which means that they’ve at least managed to pay their first premium.

This number basically met the goal that the White House set for itself last fall, so it is supposed to be a big achievement.

Except it’s not.

Just this January, the Congressional Budget Office projected that enrollment would be 12 million for 2015. And a year ago, it had forecast 13 million ObamaCare enrollees.

A little bit of math shows that sign-ups in 2015 came in 22% below the CBO’s earlier forecast.

And that’s not factoring in the many who likely drop out of ObamaCare during the year. (Between September and December last year, enrollment dropped by about 400,000.)

Meanwhile, the CBO still thinks ObamaCare will manage to more than double enrollment in 2016 to 21 million. That already seemed like a stretch, given that it would mean more than doubling enrollment in one year, even though the gain was far less this year.

It seems even less likely now, given the kind of double-digit rate increases that insurance companies are asking for.

Measuring ObamaCare’s success is starting to look a little bit like a game of Limbo.
