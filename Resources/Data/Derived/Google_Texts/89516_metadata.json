The submerged bodies of the cormorants frighten the bait to clear the water surface and here are greeted by a swarm of hungry gulls that dine with delight on their bountiful harvest.\n\nNo one would care if just baitfish were captured. But when this source of food disappears, the cormorants thrive on small game fish and this puts a lot of pressure on our commercial and sport fishing resources. Ninety nine per cent of their diet consists of fish.\n\nCormorants are also known to eat mollusks, amphibians and crustaceans. Adults can dive to depths between five and 25 feet and remain underwater for 30 to 70 seconds. They may fly five to 10 miles from their colony to search for food.\n\nI notice as well what the explosive cormorant population has done to the healthy trees and other vegetation on nesting islands off shore.\n\nThe trees and ground vegetation have been killed by the bird droppings and this destroys nesting sites for common terns, black crowned night herons and even great blue herons. With no available trees for nesting, the cormorants will nest on the ground.\n\nThe history of cormorants has them dated as far back as the late 1700s on the Lake of the Woods in northwestern Ontario. From here they have spread by the 1930s throughout the Great Lakes in numbers that prompted control measures.\n\nEven after these measures were removed their numbers continued to drop because of the accumulation of DDT and PCBs in their bodies that caused their eggs to break or deformities in the chicks, the same problem suffered by the bald eagles.\n\nBy the late 1970s their numbers grew rapidly after DDT was banned to the point where cormorants are now in nuisance numbers in nesting colonies that continue to spread.\n\nBut the Migratory Bird Treaty Act 1918 USA and the Fish and Wildlife Conservation Act, Ontario prohibit the culling of these migratory birds without a permit. This makes sense.\n\nI consider the duck and goose hunting licence a permit that should allow a daily limit of two cormorants in both Canada and the USA. This allows hunters who want to be involved in a conservation project to do so.\n\nAnd when the number of cormorants have been reduced to sustainable levels with minimum side effects in health to humans and wildlife then the two-bird limit could quickly be reduced to one per day or removed. Best of all the hunters will be paying for the cost of this conservation project. And for their cooperation the culled cormorants should not be a part of the daily limit for ducks and geese.\n\nThis would promote the honest reporting of culled birds and accurate culled numbers at the expense of those involved in the project.\n\nYes!\n\nErno Rossi is a bestselling JUNO nominated author.
