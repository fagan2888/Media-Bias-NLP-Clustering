It will replace the current center at 430 W. Napa St.\n\nFunding for the center comes from a $5 million grant under the Affordable Care Act, the latest example of Sonoma County's numerous FQHCs expanding with help from the health law. It was procured with the help of U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson, D-St. Helena, whose district includes Sonoma. Financing for the land was about $6.2 million.\n\nThe move, long in the planning stages, will enable the health center to increase its patient load by 30 percent from 7,000 to about 9,100, according to Cheryl Johnson, CEO of the health center. It currently sees some 30,000 patient visits annually, making it the largest primary care provider in Sonoma Valley for Medi-Cal, low income and uninsured patients.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_87726\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"378\"] Rendering of Sonoma Valley Community Health Center interior[/caption]\n\n\u201cWe have been preparing for the transformation and expansion of the Sonoma Valley Community Health Center for over eight years,\u201d Ms. Johnson said during the ground breaking ceremony. \u201cThis is a big and exciting day for us and for the community we support.\n\nRep.
