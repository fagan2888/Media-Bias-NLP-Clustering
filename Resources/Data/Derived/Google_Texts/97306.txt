IF YOU’RE ON A SUNDAY SHOW, a smart thing to say when you’re asked about a Holder successor: The West Wing thinks Solicitor General Don Verilli, who won the Obamacare case at the Supreme Court (kind of a big deal if you’re Barack OBAMA) is a truly smart, genial guy with zero ego. Would be great pick.

MIDTERM MESSAGES – “Republicans shift away from tax cutting mania,” by Brian Faler: “Republicans are talking about ISIS and President Obama and the Affordable Care Act and Harry Reid. ... Though tax cuts have been a mainstay of their campaigns since at least Ronald Reagan, though the top marginal tax rate is now the highest since the 1980s, though the party could win control of both chambers of Congress for the first time in almost a decade, Republicans are barely mentioning reducing tax rates with voters.

“‘In a campaign, you talk about what people are interested in,’ said Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa). ‘I keep notes on all my town meetings' and 'tax cuts haven’t come up.’ ... Some lawmakers — including ones no one would confuse for moderates — said they’re less interested in tax cuts than tax reform, a subtle distinction that has major political and policy implications.” http://politi.co/1t4e72E

RICK STENGEL featured on N.Y. Times p. A4, “Digital War Takes Shape on Websites Over ISIS,” by Brian Knowlton: “[J]ust as the United States has begun an aggressive air campaign against the militants, Richard A. Stengel, the under secretary of state for public diplomacy, believes the United States has no choice but to counter their propaganda with a forceful online response. ‘Sending a jazz trio to Budapest is not really what we want to do in 2014,’ said Mr. Stengel, referring to the soft-edged cultural diplomacy ... during the Cold War. ‘We have to be tougher, we have to be harder, particularly in the information space, and we have to hit back.’

“The State Department division that Mr. Stengel heads has tried a range of approaches for engaging with the Middle East since 9/11, from slick, Madison Avenue-style ads to traditional international-visitors and exchange programs. But now, digital operators at the State Department are directly engaging young people — and sometimes jihadists — on websites popular in Arab countries, publishing a stream of anti-Islamic State messages, and one somewhat shocking video, on Facebook or YouTube or Twitter, using the hashtag #Think Again Turn Away.” http://nyti.ms/1rzYaFa

LIVING HISTORY: Twenty years ago today, on the steps of the Capitol, House Republicans unveiled the “Contract with America.” The checklist of 10 conservative promises was credited with helping the GOP win control of the House in Newt Gingrich’s Republican Revolution of November 1994 -- the first time the party had controlled the House in 40 years. Frank Luntz, a pollster working for the House GOP, recalled that day in a phone interview from London: “For me, it was the moment of greatest optimism that I've ever had in and with American politics and, sadly, it's kind of been all downhill from there. ... It wasn't a platform. It was a contract, and it was meant to have an enforcement clause. And that whole enforcement clause -- I learned that from [focus group] sessions that I did in Denver ...

“There would be some sort of accountability if they failed, and that was the line: ‘If we break this contract, throw us out -- we mean it.’ I wanted them to say that they wouldn't run for reelection, and they were unwilling to do that. That was too far, too much. The 1-800 number, which seems so old-fashioned today was a big deal back then, giving voters the ability to get more information. ... Newt used to tell people ‘tear it out’ -- that's why we had a perforated edge [when the Contract was published as an ad in TV Guide, still framed on the wall of one of Luntz’s homes] – ‘put it up on your refrigerator and track our progress.’

“Even though Barry Jackson was running it, from a creative standpoint it was ... Newt for the overall strategy, Dick Armey for the contents, Kerry Knott for the execution, and me for the research, for the language. ... I had presented to the [House GOP] conference a big poster—there was a retreat in Salisbury [Md.] and I had presented to them what was called a ‘compact’ at the time ... I was supposed to kick their ass. This is the time when HillaryCare, ClintonCare was the rage and Republicans were doing badly. I was invited to present to them the truth.

“I think I went too overboard: ‘You're going to lose unless you get your act together. You're going to lose because you show no sense of humanity, because people hate politicians and they hate you even more. They think you don't care. They think you have no heart. ‘ A few members complained about it. They said I was rude to them. So Gingrich had me get up early the next day and walk with him. He was asking me what's the word, what stands out, what could we do that would be different, that would address everything you said yesterday evening. And he came up with the word: ‘contract.’ I immediately said: ‘This is amazing, that's it, that's the difference.’ And the reason why? In a word, accountability. ...

“[A short time later, Luntz was in Germany at a program for young leaders, where he met young Jonathan Karl, then with CNN.] I had to leave the program two days early. I mentioned to Jon: ‘I've got to do this research. We're going to put out a contract.’ He said: ‘Why do you need a contract? You're going to kill somebody?’”

WASHINGTON, INC. -- “Top Consulting Firm Emerges In Early Hillary Clinton Efforts,” by BuzzFeed’s Ruby Cramer: “Three groups in Washington have made it their business to put Hillary Clinton back in the White House: Priorities USA, Correct the Record, and Ready for Hillary. Every month or so, players from each get together. … [T]here’s [also] a fourth partner at the table [in Buffy Wicks’ M Street offices] … the Dewey Square Group, a guarded, well-connected consulting firm that has quietly emerged at the heart of the quasi-official campaign-in-waiting.

“They are, said one top Democrat, getting the structural details of a campaign ‘teed up and ready when the days comes’ — a characterization Dewey Square denies. … The agenda rarely varies. The strategists gather to check in, to trade ideas, and discuss challenges. … The attendees from the firm include Michael Whouley, a seasoned organizer who ran Bill Clinton’s field operation in 1992; Charlie Baker, one of the firm’s founding partners; and Minyon Moore, a longtime adviser to both Clintons.” http://bzfd.it/1rp96DQ

GREAT LONG READS, curated by Daniel Lippman @dlippman

--“National Insecurity: Can Obama's foreign policy be saved?” by David Rothkopf in the Sept./Oct. cover of Foreign Policy: “The problem is that in seeking to sidestep the pitfalls that plagued Bush, Obama has inadvertently created his own. Yet unlike Bush … Obama seems steadfast in his resistance both to learning from his past errors and to managing his team so that future errors are prevented. It is hard to think of a recent president who has grown so little in office. … Many of [America’s] problems have only grown dangerously worse: Its relative influence has declined; the terrorism threat has evolved and spread; and U.S. alliances are superannuated, ineffective shadows of their former selves.” http://atfp.co/1syN7Ot

--“The Power of Sleep,” by Alice Park in TIME: “At night, a legion of neurons springs into action, and like any well-trained platoon, the cells work in perfect synchrony, pulsing with electrical signals that wash over the brain with a soothing, hypnotic flow. Meanwhile, data processors sort through the reams of information that flooded the brain all day … The brain also runs checks on itself to ensure that the exquisite balance of hormones, enzymes and proteins isn’t too far off-kilter. … [C]leaners follow in close pursuit to sweep out the toxic detritus that the brain doesn’t need and which can cause all kinds of problems if it builds up. ... [Sleep is] nature’s panacea, more powerful than any drug in its ability to restore and rejuvenate the human brain and body.” http://ti.me/1uNkbyM

--“Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg: I'm Not Going Anywhere,” by Jessica Weisberg in the October issue of Elle: “Coming off of her stirring dissent in the Hobby Lobby case, 21-year veteran Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg has never been a more important voice for American women. In a rare interview … she speaks frankly with Jessica Weisberg about everything from riding an elephant with Antonin Scalia to why people who want her to resign so President Obama can appoint another progressive justice are nuts.” http://bit.ly/1okS8Db

-- “Meet the College Women Who Are Starting a Revolution Against Campus Sexual Assault,” by Vanessa Grigoriadis in New York Magazine: “A few years ago, an Ivy League student going public about her rape, telling the world her real name—let alone trying to attract attention by lugging around a mattress—would have been a rare bird. … … By owning those accusations, and pointing a finger not only at assailants but also the American university, the ivory tower of privilege, these survivors have built the most effective, organized anti-rape movement since the late ’70s.” http://thecut.io/1utMjdT

--"The Fight of Their Lives” -- The Kurds vs. ISIS, by The New Yorker’s Dexter Filkins: “Obama has spoken carefully in public, but it is plain that the Administration wants the Kurds to do two potentially incompatible things. The first is to serve as a crucial ally in the campaign to destroy ISIS, with all the military funding and equipment that such a role entails. The second is to resist seceding from the Iraqi state. … But the Kurds’ history with the state of Iraq is one of persistent enmity and bloodshed, and they see little benefit in joining up with their old antagonists.” http://nyr.kr/1qYLpEK
