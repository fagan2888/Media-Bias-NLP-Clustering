(Hell, I am one of those women.) Taking the pill is a pain \u2014 but so is getting it in the first place. Women are less likely to stick with a form of birth control when they have to go to a doctor to get it, which makes sense; stopping by the pharmacy to pick up a prescription is one thing, but adding a trip to the OBGYN also adds complication.\n\nCalifornia lawmakers have come up with a solution to this problem \u2014 sort of. A state law first passed in 2013, which is set to take full effect this year, will allow pharmacists to prescribe women hormonal contraception, including the pill, the ring and the patch, at their local CVS, Walgreens, what have you. The law, SB 493, will also allow pharmacists to prescribe medication for smoking cessation and travel abroad, as well as to administer vaccinations to people over the age of 3, order lab tests and adjust drug regimens for patients with specified ailments, such as diabetes. It goes well beyond birth control \u2014 but that\u2019s the main thing that\u2019s gotten people\u2019s attention.\n\nThe measure has the potential to greatly increase contraceptive access in California, especially with the passage of the Affordable Care Act. As reproductive rights become increasingly politicized and numerous states continue to shut down healthcare clinics, laws that effectively allow pharmacists to replace physicians as gatekeepers to birth control prescriptions could be women\u2019s lifeline for avoiding unintended pregnancy and other health issues. The entire point of the law, however, is to help people avoid cumbersome doctor\u2019s visits, which could potentially mean avoiding other necessary care.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A highly anticipated law will make it easier for women to get hormonal contraception -- but there are major risks", "title": "California women will soon be able to get birth control prescriptions straight from their pharmacists", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "A highly anticipated law will make it easier for women to get hormonal contraception -- but there are major risks", "title": "California women will soon be able to get birth control prescriptions straight from their pharmacists", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/06/08/california_women_will_soon_be_able_to_get_birth_control_prescriptions_straight_from_their_pharmacists/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2012/10/birth-control-pills-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A highly anticipated law will make it easier for women to get hormonal contraception -- but there are major risks", "title": "California women will soon be able to get birth control prescriptions straight from their pharmacists", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2012/10/birth-control-pills-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@@JennyKutner", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Jenny Kutner", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Affordable Care Act, Birth Control, California, Contraception, contraceptive access, contraceptive mandate, hormonal birth control, over the counter birth control, reproductive healthcare, Reproductive Rights", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Topics: Affordable Care Act, Birth Control, California, Contraception, contraceptive access, contraceptive mandate, hormonal birth control, over the counter birth control, reproductive healthcare, Reproductive Rights, Social News, NewsI\u2019d be a rich woman if I had a dime for every time someone I knew told me she struggled to remember to take her birth control pills.\nIt goes well beyond birth control \u2014 but that\u2019s the main thing that\u2019s gotten people\u2019s attention.\nAs reproductive rights become increasingly politicized and numerous states continue to shut down healthcare clinics, laws that effectively allow pharmacists to replace physicians as gatekeepers to birth control prescriptions could be women\u2019s lifeline for avoiding unintended pregnancy and other health issues.\nThe measure has the potential to greatly increase contraceptive access in California, especially with the passage of the Affordable Care Act.\nThe entire point of the law, however, is to help people avoid cumbersome doctor\u2019s visits, which could potentially mean avoiding other necessary care."}
