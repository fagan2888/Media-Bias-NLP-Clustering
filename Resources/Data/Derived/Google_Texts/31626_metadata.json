Oden led the offense in rushing with 69 yards on 15 carries and scored two touchdowns. He shared time with freshman Bryce Peters, who ran for 27 yards on 11 carries and scored two touchdowns.\n\nThe running back position is a critical part of CSU\u2019s spring practice that concludes Saturday with a spring game at Hughes Stadium in Fort Collins. Not only have the Rams lost Alexander, but also Kapri Bibbs, last season\u2019s star running back who left school early to try the NFL.\n\n\u201cI can play both sides of the ball,\u201d Oden, a junior out of Buffalo, N.Y., said. \u201cI\u2019m trying to get things going at running back. Right now I\u2019m studying the playbook. It\u2019s all about developing confidence. I had fun out there today, but it\u2019s a big jump going from defense to offense.\u201d\n\nEven with the loss of personnel, coach Jim McElwain indicated he wasn\u2019t overly concerned about the position. But he still is looking ahead to adding some freshman running backs and a possible junior college transfer to the mix in preseason practice in August.\n\n\u201cIf we can find a good one out there, we\u2019ll be keeping our eyes open,\u201d McElwain said of a possible addition of a JC transfer.\n\nBut he wasn\u2019t downplaying what he saw in the scrimmage.\n\n\u201cI feel good about what we have at running back,\u201d McElwain said. \u201cWe lost some good ones. But I think Oden is making the best of a position move. I\u2019m excited to see how he is keeping his pad level down, how he\u2019s moving the pile, and he made some good cuts out there today. He has some skills.\u201d\n\nOden wouldn\u2019t speculate where he is on the depth chart, but he welcomes additional competition.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll let the coach make that decision,\u201d Oden said when asked if he\u2019s the No. 1 running back. \u201cBring on the freshmen, the more the better. We\u2019ll compete and hopefully they can help us have a better offense.\u201d\n\nMcElwain was positive about the move to the Denver area for the scrimmage.\n\n\u201cWe played with some energy,\u201d McElwain said. \u201cI thought our offensive line did a really good job. It\u2019s good to see how our younger players respond to being in different surroundings.\u201d\n\nQuarterback Garrett Grayson was upbeat about spring practice.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d say we\u2019re ahead of where we wanted to be.\u201d Grayson said. \u201cWe\u2019ve met our expectations.\u201d\n\nIrv Moss: 303-954-1296, imoss@denverpost.com or twitter.com/irvmoss", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Jason Oden\u2019s switch to running back for Colorado State working well", "title": "Jason Oden\u2019s switch to running back for Colorado State working well", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/04/12/jason-odens-switch-to-running-back-for-colorado-state-working-well/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140412__Jim-McElwainp1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140412__Jim-McElwainp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-04-12T17:20:05+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T18:16:49+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcba4b\"", "article_summary": "The running back position is a critical part of CSU\u2019s spring practice that concludes Saturday with a spring game at Hughes Stadium in Fort Collins.\nCoach Jim McElwain put his team through a spring scrimmage session at Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods Park in Commerce City.\nEven though it may be out of necessity, Jason Oden is moving in to a new football home this spring at Colorado State and he isn\u2019t planning on being a short-term tenant.\nHe shared time with freshman Bryce Peters, who ran for 27 yards on 11 carries and scored two touchdowns.\n\u201cI feel good about what we have at running back,\u201d McElwain said."}
