Really. No. Bounds.\n\nA collection of bureaucrats at the National Science Foundation (NSF) used $700,000 of taxpayer money this spring to play out their Broadway fantasies by funding what they surely thought was a sure-fire-hit play.\n\nIt would combine the prose of Al Gore with music that would elevate it above his usual drone that makes audiences want to stab their ears with pencils. And there would be dancing! Combine all that with actors who can make anything come alive, and audiences around the country will not only be entertained, but informed! We will change the world!\n\nThat\u2019s the best pitch I can give this stinker \u2014 and probably close to the actual pitch the producers gave to the NSF. The actual result was a musical titled \u201cThe Great Immensity.\u201d Shocker: It was an enormous flop. Via reporter Jessica Chasmar at one of my former employers, the Washington Times:\n\nA taxpayer-funded musical on climate change is closing its curtains early amid a storm of criticism from reviewers and lawmakers. \u201cThe Great Immensity,\u201d produced by Brooklyn-based theater company The Civilians Inc. with a $700,000 grant from the National Science Foundation (NSF), has ended its run after reaching just 5 percent of its anticipated audience, Fox News reported. The play also opened a year late and failed to produce a buzz once it did. \u201cDespite fine performances, the musical mystery tour is an uneasy mix of fact and credulity-stretching fiction. It\u2019s neither flora nor fauna,\u201d New York Daily News reviewer Joe Dziemianowicz wrote in a review at the time, Fox News reported. \u201c[The] songs \u2014 whether about a doomed passenger pigeon or storm-wrecked towns \u2014 feel shoehorned in and not, pardon the pun, organic.\u201d The play\u2019s description describes the itself as \u201ca thrilling and timely production\u201d with \u201ca highly theatrical look into one of the most vital questions of our time: How can we change ourselves and our society in time to solve the enormous environmental challenges that confront us?\u201d \u201cEven the best adventurers can wander off course, and the Civilians do so on a global scale in \u2018The Great Immensity,\u2019 \u201d read a review from Time Out New York. \u201cThe inventive troupe\u2019s latest effort is all over the map. \u2026 It\u2019s not easy preaching green.\u201d\n\nThe play opend late. The play reached only 5 percent of its expected audience. It was terrible \u2014 so terrible even theater critics eager to give a hipster-Brooklyn production sending the \u201ccorrect message\u201d about the need to act on climate change couldn\u2019t give it positive reviews. Good enough for government work, right? Read on.\n\nThe play ran for three weeks in New York in April before going on a national tour. It stalled out after a single production in Kansas City, Fox News reported.\n\nGolly. What a surprise. When your big New York production hits the road, and then grinds to a halt after a single perfomance in Kansas City \u2026 well, even people like me with a very low threshold for \u201cgood enough for government work\u201d are disappointed. But if you think the bureaucrats at the NSF are disappointed in their investment of your money in this stinker, think again.\n\nThe NSF said it is too soon to tell if the grant funds were wasted. \u201cThis particular project just concluded in August, and the final report has not yet been submitted to NSF,\u201d it said in a statement, Fox News reported. \u201cFinal reports are due to NSF within 90 days following expiration of the grant. The final report will contain information about project outcomes, impacts and other data.\u201d\n\nThis is the state of the modern adminstrative state. An obvious failure cannot be called a failure. Give us a few more weeks and we\u2019ll produce the documents to prove an obvious failure needs to be funded at triple the previous level to ensure even greater success!\n\nFire 75 percent of the federal bureaucracy. Today. Figure out who needs to be re-hired next week.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://blog.heartland.org/2014/09/shocker-climate-alarmist-musical-finally-runs-out-of-taxpayer-money-quickly-closes/", "site_name": "Somewhat Reasonable", "image": "http://blog.heartland.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/The-Great-Immensity.jpg", "type": "activity", "title": "SHOCKER!
