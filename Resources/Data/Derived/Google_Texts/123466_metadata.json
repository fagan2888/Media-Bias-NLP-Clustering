With 82 percent of precincts in Trump has 46 percent of the vote to Floridan U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio's 27 percent.\n\nThe race is too close to call in Illinois between Clinton and U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT).\n\nUPDATE 1 (7:15 p.m.): In North Carolina, Clinton is being called as the projected winner, garnering 58 percent of the vote to Sanders' 39 percent with 27 percent of precincts reporting.\n\nUPDATE 2 (7:21 p.m.): Polling places in several Illinois counties will remain open late due to a shortage of ballots. Here is the breakdown of counties that are keeping some precincts open late and their respective closing times:\n\nSangamon County - 8:30 p.m.\n\nAdams County - 8:30 p.m.\n\nSuburban Cook County (due to late openings) - 8 p.m.\n\nMcHenry County - 8:30 p.m.\n\nChampaign County also ran out of ballots, but did not keep polling places open past 7 p.m.\n\nUPDATE 3 (7:23 p.m.): Rubio has suspended his presidential campaign after his loss to Trump. Rubio gave up his senate seat for a presidential run, so he will be politically sidelined by tonight's loss.\n\nMeanwhile in the Illinois Senate race, U.S. Sen. Mark Kirk (R) and U.S. Rep. Tammy Duckworth will go head to head having both won their party's primary races. The Illinois Republican Party released the following statement in response to Kirk's victory:\n\nCongratulations to U.S. Senator Mark Kirk on his victory in the Republican primary. Every day, Illinois families can count on Mark Kirk's thoughtful, independent leadership in the United States Senate. The choice for Illinois voters is clear. Mark Kirk has a record of fighting for all Illinois families to change the broken status quo in Washington, while Congresswoman Tammy Duckworth has been an ineffective ideologue who has chosen partisan division over bipartisan consensus. Illinois families desperately need Mark Kirk to break the logjam in Washington.\n\nUPDATE 4 (7:43 p.m.): Clinton is the projected winner of Ohio, with the former secretary of state receiving 65 percent of the vote to Sanders' 33 percent with 12 percent of precincts reporting.\n\nUPDATE 5 (7:48 p.m.): Challenger Juliana Stratton is currently leading incumbent Ken Dunkin, who we caught on the campaign trail earlier today, 69 percent to 31 percent.\n\nMeanwhile, Ohio Gov. John Kasich took his state, with 43 percent of the vote to Trump's 34 percent. Kasich walks away with all 66 of the state's delegates.\n\nUPDATE 6 (8:00 p.m.): The mood at Foxx's election night headquarters, which is thinly attended at this point, is upbeat thus far. Music is blaring as supporters chat and sip cocktails, reports PI's Ellyn Fortino. There is lots of media in attendance. State Rep. Will Guzzardi is among the elected officials at Foxx's HQ. Foxx is currently in the lead against incumbent Anita Alvarez, 58 percent to 29 percent. Donna More has 13 percent of the vote.\n\nMeanwhile, House Speaker Michael Madigan (D-Chicago) has beat Jason Gonzales in the 22nd state House district. We checked in on the race earlier today.\n\nAt Julianna Stratton's headquarters at the Charles Hayes Center, PI's Michael Joyce reports that the atmosphere is largely positive and supporters seem hopeful Stratton will take the win.\n\nFriend and supporter of Stratton, Kim Williams, says she wasn't surprised when Stratton announced her candidacy.\n\n\"I've known Julie for maybe 12 or 13 years,\" said Williams. \"She's always gone out of her way to help people. Whether it's children in the juvenile system or adults in jail. I really wasn't surprised she was running for office.\"\n\nWhen asked what she thinks of incumbent Ken Dunkin, her answer was simple.\n\n\"I think Rauner would be in charge\" if Dunkin won, Williams said. \"I think he would hold two offices.\"\n\nStratton is still leading Dunkin, 68 percent to 32 percent.\n\nUPDATE 7 (8:22 p.m.): We are liveblogging from Kim Foxx's campaign headquarters. Follow along @ProgressIL.\n\nUPDATE 8 (8:31 p.m.): Supporters continue to filter in as they wait for Stratton to take the stage.\n\nFelicia Davis accompanied Stratton as she campaigned. She says many voters expressed frustration with incumbent Ken Dunkin's policies. According to Davis, many of the seniors she met while campaigning felt their needs hadn't been met.\n\n\"Assistance and things like that never came to fruition for them,\" says Davis. \"Also some young women that felt child care was very important to them.\"\n\nUPDATE 9 (8:39 p.m.): Progress Illinois checked in with State Rep. Will Guzzardi (D-Chicago) at Foxx's election night party, which has picked up in attendance and excitement over the past hour and a half. Unofficial election results show Foxx ahead of Alvarez.\n\n\"I could not be more excited right now. I feel like there's no place I'd rather be than in this room right now,\" he said. \"We're seeing the results that we always believed were possible, which is that this wasn't just gonna be one group of people supporting one candidate, another group supporting the other. It was gonna be a countywide phenomenon where people were ready for change and ready to\" support Foxx.\n\n\"I think it is a referendum on Anita,\" Guzzardi added. \"I think it's also a referendum on Kim and on her message about criminal justice reform, that people are sick and tired of the war on young men of color and mass incarceration of a generation of black and brown men. We're ready for something different.\"\n\nUPDATE 10 (8:40 p.m.): The race for Cook County State's Attorney has just been called for Kim Foxx by WGN News, with 57 percent of the vote.\n\nUPDATE 11 (8:45 p.m.): Dorothy Brown has beat out her opponents, Chicago Ald. Michlle Harris (8th) and attorney Jacob Meister, in the Cook County Circuit Court Clerk's race.\n\nUPDATE 12 (8:56 p.m.): SEIU Illinois State Council President Tom Balanoff released the following statement in response to Foxx's win:\n\nCook County residents today cast a decisive vote for transparency and the reform of our broken criminal justice system. Democratic nominee for Cook County State's Attorney Kim Foxx will bring the transformative change we need to keep our neighborhoods safe and to restore the public's trust in the State's Attorney's office. We are proud to stand with and congratulate Kim Foxx on her victory because it is a win for all of us. Together we will continue our fight to eradicate the economic, social and racial inequality that currently plagues our state.\n\nUPDATE 13 (9:11 p.m.): Juliana Stratton is commenting on her victory in the 5th state House district race against longtime incumbent Ken Dunkin.\n\nStratton says she's excited for the constituents in her district.\n\n\"I'm so thrilled for the people of the fifth district who deserve better leadership,\" she said. \"I'm so thankful to serve them in this capacity.\"\n\n\"Residents of our district recognize they have not been served well over the past 13 years by an AWOL state representative more focused on self service than public service; who decided to switch parties, in fact, if not by name,\" she added.\n\nMeanwhile, on the national level, Donald Trump has won the Illinois and North Carolina Republican primary elections.\n\nUPDATE 14 (9:25 p.m.): SEIU Healthcare Illinois President Keith Kelleher released the following statement on the wins by Stratton and Foxx in their respective races, calling them a \"stunning rejection\" of Gov. Bruce Rauner's politics:\n\nTuesday was a stunning rejection of the divisive checkbook politics of Gov. Bruce Rauner, who flooded the state with an unprecedented amount of unaccountable dark money that was meant to overwhelm the interests of the working families of Illinois. Likewise, the decisive victory of Kim Foxx in the Cook County State's Attorney's race was a clear call by the people to fix the broken trust in our criminal justice system that was symbolized in Rahm Emanuel's and Anita Alvarez's disastrous handling of the Laquan McDonald shooting. Our 60,000 Illinois members had a tremendous stake in today's outcomes and we're proud of the work we did, including more than 300 volunteer workers at the doors and the polls just today and more than 10,000 phone calls made in support of our candidates. Even Democrats whose campaigns were funded by Bruce Rauner had to run against his divisive agenda, but it's gratifying to know that Rauner proved generally unable to buy the outcomes he wanted. Even more gratifying is to see Rep. Ken Dunkin pay the price for his utter betrayal of seniors, children, people with disabilities and our child care and home healthcare workers, whom he looked in the eye and promised to protect, but instead sided with Rauner and his big-money special interest friends. Let's hope Gov. Rauner heeds the will of the people, abandons his divisive agenda and starts to seek real solutions to grow our economy, protect our vulnerable and fix what he has broken.\n\nUPDATE 15 (9:31 p.m.): In the general election U.S. Senate race between Duckworth and Kirk, the candidates are already firing shots, with Duckworth blasting Kirk for his support of Trump. Meanwhile, Kirk is walking his support of Trump's candidacy back, saying his comments were taken out context. The senator now says he will make a decision on who he will support in his party's presidential race in July during the GOP convention.\n\nCritics are blasting Kirk for his perceived about face on the Trump issue.\n\n\"No matter how hard Mark Kirk tries to appear moderate, he can't run away from the warm embrace of Donald Trump this election season,\" said Rachel Thomas, press secretary for Emily's List. \"Whether it's making offensive comments toward women or wanting to roll back access to health care for thousands of women and families in Illinois, both Trump and Kirk share a dangerous agenda that will make it harder for Illinois families to get ahead. And while Kirk may be happy to voice his support for Trump if he's the eventual nominee, he and the rest of the GOP will be sorry come November.\"\n\nUPDATE 16 (9:39 p.m.): Raja Krishnamoorthi has won the Democratic race in the 8th congressional district, garnering 60 percent of the vote. His opponents, Illinois State Sen. Mike Noland and Villa Park Mayor Deb Bullwinkel, received 28 percent and 12 percent of the vote, respectively.\n\nNoland has released a statement conceding in the race:\n\nI want to congratulate my opponents on a well run, issue based campaign. It was an honor to debate the issues with such informed opponents and while we didn't always agree, we all offered a progressive message of how to move our country forward. I look forward to supporting the entire Democratic ticket in November. While our campaign came up short today we heard the message that voters are trying to send to their elected officials. I am proud that our campaign consistently offered the voters a progressive vision that included raising the minimum wage to $15, reforming our broken immigration system, and working to expand the Affordable Care Act to cover more Americans. I thank everyone that voted for our campaign, the hundreds of volunteers who devoted their time and efforts, and I look forward to continuing to serve the people of the 22nd legislative district.\n\nUPDATE 17 (9:53 p.m.): Patricia Van Pelt has bested challenger Bob Fioretti in the 5th district state senate race, with the incumbent garnering 69 percent of the vote. The 2nd district state senate race between Angelica Alfaro and Omar Aquino has not been called, but Aquino is leading, 53 percent to 47 percent.\n\nIn the 15th state House race, John D'Amico beat challenger Jac Charlier, 60 percent to 40 percent.\n\nUPDATE 18 (10:01 p.m.): Voter turnout looks to be higher than expected in Chicago and Cook County. Turnout in Chicago looks to be above 50 percent thanks to late turnout and same-day registration and voting. Primaries in the city typically see turnout in the neighborhood of 23 percent to 24 percent. Some 26,000 people took advantage of same-day registration and voting in the city, and there were lines for students looking to vote past 8 p.m. near Loyola University, according to WGN News. The late surge of young voters could be a bonus for the Sanders campaign, which has seemed to nab the Democratic youth vote during this election cycle.\n\nAt the county level, same-day registration and voting was at about 18,000 today and turnout looks to be at 47 percent.\n\nUPDATE 19 (10:11 p.m.): Incumbent Christian Mitchell staved off challenger Jay Travis in the 26th state House district, 56 percent to 44 percent.\n\nThe race between Clinton and Sanders is still too close to call in Illinois with 82 percent of precincts reporting. The spread is about 44,000 in Clinton's favor.\n\nUPDATE 20 (10:25 p.m.): Despite Rauner's support of his challenger, Republican incumbent Sam McCann has a healthy lead over Bryce Benton in Illinois' 50th district senate race, 56 percent to 44 percent.\n\nUPDATE 21 (11:12 p.m.): Check out our full reports on the victory speeches of Juliana Stratton and Kim Foxx from our reporters at the candidates' respective campaign headquarters.\n\nMeanwhile, in the Democratic presidential race, we are still waiting to see which candidate will pull out a win. With 95 percent of precincts reporting, Clinton's lead over Sanders has whittled down a bit more, with the spread being about 35,000.\n\nUPDATE 22 (11:29 p.m.): Clinton has been named as the apparent winner of Illinois, with the count currently sitting at 51 percent to 48 percent. The spread is at about 34,000 with 96 percent of precincts reporting.\n\nUPDATE 23 (11:59 p.m.): Trump and Clinton are the apparent winners in their party's respective primary races in Missouri. Because the races in Illinois and Missouri are so close, the delegate distribution between the candidates will be almost equal for Sanders and Clinton and very close between first and second place on the GOP side.\n\nUPDATE 24 (12:15 a.m.): Brad Schneider bested Highland Park Mayor Nancy Rotering and will now face incumbent U.S. Rep. Bob Dold in the 10th congressional district for the third consecutive election cycle.\n\nTeresa Mah maintained her lead and beat Alex Acevedo, 51 percent to 49 percent in the state House's 2nd district race.\n\nUPDATE 25 (1:16 a.m.): The following U.S. House incumbents have beat out challengers in their respective congressional districts: Bobby Rush (D-IL,1), Robin Kelly (D-Il,2), Luis Gutierrez (D-IL,4), Peter Roskam (R-IL,6), Danny Davis (D-IL,7), Rodney Davis (R-IL,13), and John Shimkus (R-IL,14). As noted previously, U.S. Sen. Mark Kirk (R) beat his opponent, James Marter. The vote was 71 percent to 29 percent in the incumbent's favor.\n\nIn the state senate side, the victorious incumbents are: Patricia Van Pelt (D-Chicago,5), Michael Hastings (D-Tinley Park,19), Sam McCann (R-Plainview,50) and Dale Righter (R-Mattoon,55). The winning state reps are Cynthia Soto (D-Chicago,4), Sonya Harper (D-Chicago,6), Chris Welch (D-Chicago,7), John D'Amico (D-Chicago,15), House Speaker Michael Madigan (D-Chicago,22), Christian Mitchell (D-Chicago,26), Thaddeus Jones, D-Calumet City,29), Jaime Andrade (D-Chicago,40), Avery Bourne (R-Raymond,95), Sara Jimenez (R-Tinley Park,99), and David Reis (R-Willow Hill,109).\n\nThat about wraps it up for our election night coverage.
