The video, which takes viewers through a slightly emotional journey, takes place at the Kansas City airport where Kander was deployed during his service in the military.\n\n\u201cMissouri has a senator who has been in Washington for nearly twenty years and has been running for this office or another for over 40 years,\u201d said Kander in the video. \u201cFor too long, he\u2019s been a part of the problem.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor years, even with our economy suffering at home and our national security threatened abroad, too many politicians in both political parties have been more concerned with scoring political points than doing what\u2019s right for our country,\u201d Kander said in the video. \u201cWe can\u2019t change Washington if we don\u2019t change the people we send there. I believe it\u2019s time for a new generation of leaders who\u2019ve come of age at a time of unprecedented challenges and threats to our country, and who are committed to bringing people together and doing what\u2019s right no matter what the personal cost.\u201d\n\nKander previously served as a state legislator representing Kansas City, where he passed one of the first major ethics reform in almost 20 years.\n\nThe incumbent senator, Roy Blunt, 64, will be up for re-election in 2016. Before his election in 2016, Blunt was a congressman from Southwest Missouri who served as the House Majority Whip and also temporarily served as the House Majority Leader. His congressional leadership has made him a quick star in the Senate, where he has been one of the most outspoken about Obamacare and immigration.\n\nThe 2016 campaign guarantees to be entertaining. Blunt is ruthless and is one of the first candidates in Missouri\u2019s history to travel to all 114 counties (and the City of St. Louis) in a short time frame. Kander is young, hungry and enthusiastic.\n\nRepublican State Sen. Will Kraus has announced his bid for secretary of state, which is left open with Kander\u2019s announcement.\n\nSenator Claire McCaskill, Governor Jay Nixon, Attorney General Chris Koster and State Treasurer Clint Zweifel Endorse Kander\u2019s Campaign\n\nSt. Louis City Treasurer Tishaura Jones will serve as Kander\u2019s campaign treasurer, and he has been endorsed by all of his fellow Democratic statewide elected officials in Missouri: U.S. Senator Claire McCaskill, Governor Jay Nixon, Attorney General Chris Koster and Treasurer Clint Zweifel.\n\n\u201cThere is no stronger candidate in Missouri to take on Senator Blunt than Jason Kander. And no one better to fight on behalf of Missouri\u2019s working families,\u201d U.S. Senator Claire McCaskill said.\n\n\u201cWashington can use some common sense from Missouri, and I can\u2019t think of a better person to change the mentality there than Jason Kander. He volunteered to serve our country in Afghanistan and did so with great distinction, and has taken on important issues in our state like fighting for campaign finance and ethics reform, protecting survivors of domestic violence, and standing up for his fellow veterans. I look forward to working to help elect him the next United States Senator from Missouri,\u201d Missouri Governor Jay Nixon said.\n\n\u201cEvery day, Jason Kander uses the lessons he learned serving in the Army in Afghanistan to do what\u2019s right for Missouri. He doesn\u2019t care who gets credit for an idea, he just wants to get the job done for our state. We need that approach in Washington, which is why I am supporting Jason Kander for United States Senate,\u201d Missouri Attorney General Chris Koster said.\n\n\u201cJason has done a great job protecting investors from fraud and standing up for voting rights. He has worked to make government more efficient and transparent for Missourians,\u201d Missouri State Treasurer Clint Zweifel said.\n\n\u201cAs our Secretary of State, Jason Kander has worked hard to cut red tape and make it easier to do business in Missouri, protect seniors from financial scams, and advocate for open and honest government. I\u2019m proud to support Jason for United States Senate because I know he will work as hard as he can every day for St. Louis and Missouri,\u201d St. Louis City Treasurer Tishaura Jones said.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Missouri Times", "description": "KANSAS CITY, Mo. \u2013 Missouri\u2019s Secretary of State and youngest elected statewide official in the country Jason Kander announced today he is running for United States Senate in 2016 against\u00a0Republican Senator Roy Blunt.
