Sprint Corp. says in state filings that it has given layoff notices to 829 employees at its suburban Kansas City campus in the past three months.

The telecommunications company provided the information late Friday in a filing with the Kansas Department of Commerce.

The Kansas City Star reports that the notice was filed with the state under a federal law designed to give workers more notice when there are mass layoffs.

Job cuts have been expected since October when Sprint announced a $2.5 billion cost-cutting plan. But Sprint hadn't released any numbers until Friday. The number of Sprint layoffs outside the Kansas City area hasn't yet been disclosed.

A company spokeswoman says about 6,000 employees would remain at the company's Overland Park campus after the job cuts.
