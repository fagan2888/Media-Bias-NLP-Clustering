Office of the State Superintendent of Education, who oversees early learning.\n\nShe cited an analysis from 2012 showing that there were enough licensed day-care seats in centers and home-based programs to serve only a quarter of children younger than 3.\n\nThe District is a national leader in expanding access to preschool, offering universal full-day programs to 3- and 4-year-olds. Now, Groginsky said, the OSSE\u2019s top priority for early learning is to increase capacity of child care for infants and toddlers.\n\n[City-wide analysis shows that D.C. preschool quality varies]\n\nChallenges with availability, funding and quality of child-care programs for infants and toddlers dominated a public hearing about early education Saturday before the D.C. Council Education Committee.\n\nThe cost of child care is a major concern for low-income families who must rely on government subsidies that many providers said do not cover the costs of quality programs. About a quarter of infants and toddlers in the District come from families with incomes below the federal poverty line.\n\nIt is also a pressing issue for middle-class families who are paying market rates, which can run about $1,800 a month, among the highest in the country.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not a parent, but that certainly has my attention,\u201d said D.C. Council member David Grosso (I-At Large).\n\nIn all kinds of settings, child-care providers are operating on shoestring budgets, said Judy Berman, deputy director of DC Appleseed, a nonprofit organization that is working with the DC Fiscal Policy Institute to study the actual costs of providing quality care in the District by surveying providers.\n\nThe report will not be finished until early next year, but Berman testified Saturday that many child-care providers rely on donated services and materials. They often pay employees very low wages; some operators pay their staff members but not themselves.\n\n\u201cThe industry is being subsidized by the owners and employees of child-care organizations,\u201d she said.\n\nThe OSSE is also conducting an analysis to estimate the costs of providing quality child care. The child-care subsidy was last increased in 2013.\n\nAt the hearing, a few people also weighed in on a bill, sponsored by D.C. Council member Vincent B. Orange (D-At Large), that would open an early-learning academy in Ward 5 and be named for the late Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall and the late D.C. Mayor Marion Barry. Orange\u2019s bill would establish an all-day, comprehensive, research-based early learning academy for children ages 3 to 5.\n\nBut most focused on the large unmet need in funding and programs for the city\u2019s youngest residents.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "education, dc, schoolsl, early childhood education, day care and baby boom, osse and chidl care", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "D.C.
