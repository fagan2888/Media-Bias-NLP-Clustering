Jha, M.D., a professor at the Harvard School of Public Health, told Forbes contributor Leah Binder.\n\nHospital mortality rates have trivial financial consequences, Jha said, and under the Affordable Care Act, individual pay-for-performance for doctors and nurses doesn't hold entire healthcare systems accountable.\n\n\"It's not on the top priority list for CEOs. It's not what keeps CEOs awake at night. And until we get CEOs losing sleep about unsafe care, we're not going to make a big dent in the failures of our healthcare system,\" Jha told Binder.\n\nAnother concern is readmission-based hospital reimbursements, he said.\n\n\"Readmissions [are] not a measure of quality, [they are] a surrogate marker for quality,\" Jha said. Readmissions for medical conditions such as heart attacks and pneumonia often occur because of measures that are not related to hospital care quality, such as how sick the patients are and what kind of social support they have at home.\n\nJha suggests Medicare use a more long-term approach, such as bundled payments tied to real quality measures over 90 days as opposed to 30 days. Hospitals must have a better understanding of post-acute and longer-term care, and be accountable for long-term patient outcomes, he said. Only then will the healthcare industry see major improvements and positive changes.\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- here's the article\n\nRelated Articles:\n\n5 steps to create a culture of patient safety\n\nHospitals get 10 more checklists to keep patients safe", "article_metadata": {"description": "Patient safety\u00a0progress is \"excruciatingly slow,\" mainly because hospitals lack incentive to improve care and performance measures often miss the mark, one health expert\u00a0told\u00a0Forbes", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "Patient safety\u00a0progress is \"excruciatingly slow,\" mainly because hospitals lack incentive to improve care and performance measures often miss the mark, one health expert\u00a0told\u00a0Forbes", "title": "Patient safety progress 'excruciatingly slow,' expert says", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/patient-safety-progress-excruciatingly-slow-expert-says/2014-02-21", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "Affordable Care Act,Care Delivery,Harvard School Of Public Health,hospital reimbursement,Operations & Business Management,Patient Care & Outcomes,patient safety,Preventable Medical Errors,readmissions", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Care Delivery,Operations & Business Management,Patient Care & Outcomes"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd103\"", "article_summary": "Patient safety progress is \"excruciatingly slow,\" mainly because hospitals lack incentive to improve care and performance measures often miss the mark, one health expert told Forbes.\n\"Readmissions [are] not a measure of quality, [they are] a surrogate marker for quality,\" Jha said.\nHospitals must have a better understanding of post-acute and longer-term care, and be accountable for long-term patient outcomes, he said.\nJha suggests Medicare use a more long-term approach, such as bundled payments tied to real quality measures over 90 days as opposed to 30 days.\nTo learn more:- here's the articleRelated Articles:5 steps to create a culture of patient safetyHospitals get 10 more checklists to keep patients safe"}
