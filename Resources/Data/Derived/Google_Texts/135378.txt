Markale Deandra

Police say they've arrested a 22-year-old man in the fatal shooting of Auburn football player Jakell Lenard Mitchell.

Auburn Police Capt. Will Matthews issued an agency statement Sunday afternoon that said Markale Deandra Hart of Camp Hill, Alabama, has been arrested on a felony warrant charging him with murder. Police add Hart's being held at a county jail in the state.

It was not immediately known if Hart had an attorney and the statement didn't provide any details of how he was taken into custody. Police also disclosed in the statement that Mitchell, who was shot early Sunday at an off-campus apartment complex, received multiple gunshot wounds to the chest.

The statement says no additional arrests are expected at this time, but didn't elaborate further on the shooting and arrest.
