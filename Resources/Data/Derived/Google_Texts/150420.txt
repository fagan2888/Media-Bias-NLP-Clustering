Oxford Nanopore‘s handheld MinION sequencing device is receiving rave reviews from the scientists that have tested it.

The mini-sequencer allows users to sequence DNA remotely – and could help track disease outbreaks, provide food security and prevent the trafficking of endangered animals. Given its low cost and ease of use, such a device could be an important way to bridge the gap between precision medicine and mobile health on a broad scale.

The device was recently evaluated by an independent international consortium of researchers, studying whether results on these devices are reproducible. Oxford Nanopore, a University of Oxford spinout, has long been a competitor for companies like Illumina.

While the device won’t do whole genome sequencing, or conduct them with the same acuity as, say, one of Illumina’s X Tens, it can rapidly identify bacterial and viral strains, and determine genetic variants in portions of DNA. Although this long-awaited device is still used largely by academics, the idea is to commercialize these portable tools once the glitches have been ironed out. The Guardian writes:
