Most days Gusky is either in rural Texas tending to patients in need of emergency care that\u2019s usually far out of reach, or he\u2019s on the road documenting what lies in, around and, yes, beneath far-flung locales. He\u2019s documented some of those sojourns in two tomes thus far: 2008\u2032s Bordertown: The Odyssey of an American Place and, four years earlier, Silent Places: Landscapes of Jewish Life and Loss in Eastern Europe about the Holocaust.\n\nHis latest work goes back even further \u2014 to World War I and the hidden cities carved into the earth beneath private farms in France. There, Gusky has located what he\u2019s called the Hidden World of WWI containing artifacts, sculptures and carvings stretching for miles in the vast pitch-black beneath the idyllic countryside.\n\nGusky\u2019s preparing to publish 2,000 photos of his buried treasures, and the work will debut in the August issue of National Geographic. But it\u2019s already available to sneak peek on the doctor\u2019s website and in the video below, as well as a piece in the UK Daily Mail that ran earlier this week.\n\nThe cities, says Gusky in the promo film, \u201cwere used for shelter by armies on both sides, tens of thousands of men. They\u2019re beneath the trenches in ancient rock quarries, which were converted into modern underground cities with rail and telecommunications, electricity, power stations and an amazing amount of art and human inscriptions. \u2026 I found a world frozen in time.\u201d\n\nIt was almost impossible to gain access to the sites, Gusky has said; those living above them were reluctant, to say the least, to let a nosy doctor from Dallas go poking around underground cities that hadn\u2019t been disturbed in a century. But eventually he was allowed in, and spent some six months, on and off, shooting what he saw.\n\n\u201cSeeing these subterranean cities for the first time was one of the most moving experiences of my life,\u201d Gusky says in a prepared statement. \u201cFinding hundreds and hundreds of messages to the future, written by soldiers in their own hand, made time seem to standstill. I feel a tremendous responsibility to the people who trusted me enough to share their secrets about these places. It was also amazing to realize that while some people knew about some of these spaces, no one knew about all of them.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"liveFyreID": "aHR0cDovL3RoZXNjb29wYmxvZy5kYWxsYXNuZXdzLmNvbS8yMDE0LzA3L2RhbGxhcy1kb2N0b3ItZG9jdW1lbnRzLXRoZS1idXJpZWQtY2l0aWVzLW9mLXdvcmxkLXdhci1pLWhpZGRlbi1mb3ItYS1jZW50dXJ5LWJlbmVhdGgtdGhlLWZyZW5jaC1jb3VudHJ5c2lkZS5odG1sLw==", "generator": "WordPress 3.9.12", "author": "Robert Wilonsky", "og": {"site_name": "The Scoop Blog", "description": "A longtime reader with a deep interest in war history directs our attention to the amazing website of Dr. Jeff Gusky, who, we have been told by his publicist, seldom\u2026", "title": "Dallas doctor documents the buried cities of World War I hidden for a century beneath the French countryside", "url": "http://thescoopblog.dallasnews.com/2014/07/dallas-doctor-documents-the-buried-cities-of-world-war-i-hidden-for-a-century-beneath-the-french-countryside.html/", "image": "http://thescoopblog.dallasnews.com/wp-content/themes/dallasnews/images/facebook-default-black.jpg", "type": "article"}, "LastModifiedDate": "2014-07-19T08:27:19Z", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image"}, "PublishDate": "2012-04-11T13:59:21Z", "wp-parsely_version": "1.7", "cXenseParse": {"recs": {"publishtime": "2012-04-11T13:59:21Z"}}, "google-site-verification": "ZjZz-aaVcLkLDp8kIkLnEwtSTZlAwGgQhLyd1pXAbA8", "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdef63\"", "article_summary": "His latest work goes back even further \u2014 to World War I and the hidden cities carved into the earth beneath private farms in France.\nThe cities, says Gusky in the promo film, \u201cwere used for shelter by armies on both sides, tens of thousands of men.\nThere, Gusky has located what he\u2019s called the Hidden World of WWI containing artifacts, sculptures and carvings stretching for miles in the vast pitch-black beneath the idyllic countryside.\nThey\u2019re beneath the trenches in ancient rock quarries, which were converted into modern underground cities with rail and telecommunications, electricity, power stations and an amazing amount of art and human inscriptions.\nGusky\u2019s preparing to publish 2,000 photos of his buried treasures, and the work will debut in the August issue of National Geographic."}
