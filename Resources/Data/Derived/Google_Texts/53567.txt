Colorado native Michelle Waterson will not be fighting at UFC 194 after suffering an injury during training.

Waterson (13-4), ranked No. 11 in the UFC in the women’s strawweight division, was slated to face No. 5 Tecia Torres (6-0) on the card. Torres will face Jocelyn Jones-Lybarger (6-1) instead, UFC announced Friday.

“Thank you everybody for wishing me a speedy recovery, I’m getting better each day and hope to have some good news very soon,” Waterson posted on Instagram.
