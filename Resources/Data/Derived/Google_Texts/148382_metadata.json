An effective digital strategy, said Brayton, is one that recognizes the ability of social media to connect politicians with specific audiences.\n\nPresident Barack Obama's social media hits are by now almost legendary. Recent attention grabbers include grabbing coffee with Jerry Seinfeld and sitting down for a Between Two Ferns interview with Zach Galifianakis.\n\nMore controversially, he granted interviews to three YouTube stars ahead of last year's State of the Union address.\n\nAmong those who got a one-on-one with the president were GloZell Green, a woman made famous for having swallowed a ladle full of cinnamon, and fashionista Bethany Mota, whose YouTube channel has more than 10 million subscribers.\n\nWhat about mainstream media?\n\nJenna Brayton joined the White House in 2014, after having worked on Obama's re-election campaign. (Jonathan Montpetit/CBC)\n\nThat kind of privileged access to the president miffed legacy media outlets like the New York Times, Brayton admitted.\n\nBut the YouTube stars provided access to a demographic that the president was keen to reach \u2014 young women \u2014 at a juncture when he wanted to sell the benefits of the Affordable Care Act (better known as Obamacare).\n\n\"Bethany Mota's channel is almost entirely young women, who have an interest and a stake in the ACA, or at least in knowing that the ACA gives you a Pap smear for free,\" Brayton said.\n\n\"That's a direct way to talk to all those young girls who probably don't know about that. If we had gone through the New York Times ... would all those young girls have read that interview with him? Probably not.\"\n\nEach celebrity appearance is designed to deliver a specific audience to the president: \"He's never doing something for no reason.\"\n\nDignity of the presidency?\n\nBrayton, who joined the White House in 2014 after having worked on Obama's re-election campaign, recognizes that the digital orientation of the Obama presidency has rankled some; just as Trudeau's pushup/mic drop has prompted as much groaning as swooning.\n\nObama's online presence has, for instance, invited criticism of \"entertainment politics\" or being a \"celebrity president.\"\n\nBill Clinton's former press secretary, Mike McCurry, told the New York Times that Obama's internet antics caused him to \"worry about the dignity of the presidency.\"\n\nFor better or worse, though, Brayton says that social media and branding awareness are the future of politics. It has been an especially effective tool for the president in securing support for his perpetually embattled healthcare reform.\n\nShe estimates that sign-ups increased by a factor of millions thanks simply to the Galifianakis interview. \"It's working,\" she said. \"It's hard to argue with something that's getting results.\"", "article_metadata": {"date": "2016/05/08", "description": "Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's ability to go viral, seemingly at will, has caught the attention of the pioneers of political social media \u2014 the Obama White House.", "application-name": "www.cbc.ca", "og": {"url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/trudeau-social-media-1.3572145", "image": "http://i.cbc.ca/1.3547562.1461339107!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_1180/justin-trudeau-at-perimeter.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's ability to go viral, seemingly at will, has caught the attention of the pioneers of political social media \u2014 the Obama White House.", "title": "A master of political social branding praised Trudeau's digital skills"}, "vf": {"section": "2.652", "unique_id": "1.3572145"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://i.cbc.ca/1.3547562.1461339107!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_460/justin-trudeau-at-perimeter.jpg"}, "site": "@cbcnews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noarchive", "keywords": "Magazines and journals, United States, Media, News media, Brayton, Mike Mccurry, Jerry Seinfeld, Perimeter Institute, Bill Clinton, Justin Trudeau, Canada, U.S. Democratic Party, Government and politics, Montr\u00e9al, Barack Obama, Zach Galifianakis, Ontario, House Of Commons, Bethany Mota, Waterloo(CA), White House, Jenna Brayton", "fb": {"app_id": 578347858989863}, "msApplication-PackageFamilyName": "CanadianBroadcastingCorpo.CBC_pw8q9bvavk68p", "msApplication-ID": "App", "original-headline": "justin-trudeaus-social-media-skills-catch-eye-of-white-house-"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdee99\"", "article_summary": "Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's ability to go viral, seemingly at will, has caught the attention of the pioneers of political social media \u2014 the Obama White House.\n\"I wanted to send an email to [Trudeau's] social media team to say 'Great job,'\" Brayton said during a recent visit to Montreal.\nIt's not all about going viralBut the value of social media mastery for politicians lies not only in those moments that go viral.\nPresident Barack Obama's social media hits are by now almost legendary.\nAn effective digital strategy, said Brayton, is one that recognizes the ability of social media to connect politicians with specific audiences."}
