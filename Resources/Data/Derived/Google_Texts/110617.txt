In the wake of major Supreme Court rulings on Obamacare and same-sex marriage, a majority of American voters say they are “uncomfortable” with the path the country is on when it comes to social issues.

According to a Washington Post-ABC News poll released Wednesday, 64 percent of registered voters are uncomfortable with the country’s direction on social issues, with 45 percent describing themselves as “strongly” uncomfortable with this path.

In contrast, only 34 percent of American voters identify themselves as comfortable with the United States’ trajectory on social issues.

Conducted between July 16 and 19, the poll comes in the wake of two major social issue victories for liberals and the Obama administration at the Supreme Court.

At the end of June, the court saved the president’s health care law by ruling that Obamacare authorized federal tax credits for eligible Americans in states with their own health care exchanges and those with federal exchanges.

A day later, the court also handed down a historic ruling that made same-sex marriage legal nationwide.

Despite the fact that Americans are uncomfortable with the general direction of the country on social issues, narrow majorities of U.S. voters support each of the two rulings. Fifty-one percent of voters approve of the decision on same-sex marriage, while 45 percent oppose it. A slim majority of registered voters — 45 percent — support the Obamacare ruling, while 43 percent do not.

Still, Americans agree that the United States is on the wrong path under the Obama administration, with 65 percent of registered voters agreeing that things in the country have seriously wandered off on the wrong track.
