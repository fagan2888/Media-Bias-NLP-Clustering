Snowden still stirring the political pot\n\nEdward Snowden may be living on the lam in Russia, but he continues to be a lightning rod in American politics.\n\nThe former government contractor\u2019s stolen documents revealing vast amounts of government overreach have damaged poll numbers for defenders of the surveillance programs while handing Republican presidential hopeful Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul a potent wedge issue that threatens to upend his party\u2019s traditionally strong national security stance.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nAnd that\u2019s just in nine months.\n\nBig Brother critics see a big political payoff if they can keep riding Snowden\u2019s coattails. They\u2019ll get another opportunity Monday when Snowden is scheduled to address via videoconference the South by Southwest festival in Austin, Texas. It\u2019s a debate that looks like it will endure through 2014 and possibly into 2016 thanks to Paul\u2019s White House ambitions and the rhetorical challenges for anyone seen as supporting the National Security Agency.\n\n( PHOTOS: 15 great quotes on NSA spying)\n\nAmericans may still be divided over whether Snowden is a whistleblower or a traitor. But that\u2019s almost beside the point. The hard evidence of the NSA\u2019s controversial practices has struck a nerve with war-weary parts of the Republican and Democratic parties\u2019 bases and gives Capitol Hill opponents like Paul and Rep. Justin Amash (R-Mich.) a big boost to grow their national profiles.\n\nAt the same time, NSA defenders including President Barack Obama and Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) have seen their approval ratings drop after struggling to explain why Americans\u2019 phone records need to be swept up in the government\u2019s anti-terrorism dragnet.\n\n\u201cThe big danger isn\u2019t where you are on the spectrum. The big danger is saying, \u2018We know best.\u2019 That will piss people off and that\u2019s what I suspect is driving Dianne Feinstein\u2019s ratings down,\u201d former Vermont Gov. Howard Dean told POLITICO.\n\nPoliticians have a long history of scoring points when government surveillance goes overboard, from the \u201cWatergate babies\u201d elected on the heels of President Richard Nixon\u2019s resignation to tea party Republicans invigorated by last year\u2019s news that the Internal Review Service targeted their applications for tax-exempt status.\n\n( Also on POLITICO: Mike Pompeo: Cancel Snowden at SXSW)\n\nEnter the NSA, which has emerged as a political force despite more than a decade of debate since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks over personal privacy and protecting national security. Many Americans have come to accept extra surveillance in public spaces \u2014 they\u2019re also handing over their personal data in droves as they become more and more connected at work and home \u2014 but this is also a time when a new generation of voters is coming of age who know of the first major terror attack on U.S. soil since Pearl Harbor only thanks to the History Channel.\n\nPaul\u2019s forays into national security have been one of the key features of his short Senate career. He staged a 13-hour filibuster last March against the threat of drone strikes on American citizens on U.S. soil and filed a class action lawsuit against Obama and his national security team over the NSA tactics. As Paul follows in his libertarian father\u2019s footsteps with a likely White House bid, he has said he sees the privacy issue as an ideal entry point to make inroads with young voters, including Democrats.\n\n\u201cI think in 2016 if you had a more libertarian-leaning Republican, and you had someone like Hillary Clinton, I think you could actually completely transform where people think they are and what party people think they have allegiance for,\u201d Paul said in January during the State of the Net conference in Washington.\n\nSeveral Republicans interviewed about Paul\u2019s NSA crusade cautioned that his appeal is limited to a niche audience of anti-government libertarians and civil liberties activists. Paul doesn\u2019t speak well to Republicans concerned about his calls to limit the U.S. presence on the foreign stage or to abolish the Federal Reserve.\n\n( PHOTOS: CPAC 2014)\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t help him to be an isolationist candidate,\u201d said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, former John McCain 2008 chief economic policy adviser. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be very hard to get through the Republican primaries.\u201d\n\nBecause there\u2019s a split inside the GOP \u2014 for example, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie last summer slammed libertarians including Paul for driving \u201cthese esoteric, intellectual debates\u201d and urged the NSA\u2019s critics to \u201ccome to New Jersey and sit across from the widows and the orphans and have that conversation\u201d \u2014 party strategists predicted the issue would sort itself out in the wide-open 2016 presidential primary campaign.\n\n\u201cThis is not like Obamacare,\u201d said a senior GOP official, adding that the party isn\u2019t polling on the issue either because of the internal split. \u201cIt\u2019s a waste of resources.\u201d\n\nBut by building a brand for himself around a core set of issues, including NSA surveillance, drones and marijuana laws, Paul is making a \u201cgood play in the primary\u201d to differentiate himself from potential rivals like Christie and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, said Lanhee Chen, a former senior policy adviser to Mitt Romney\u2019s 2012 presidential campaign.\n\n\u201cIt could be effective because it dovetails with his general disposition on these issues, but also because he\u2019s so out front on this particular one,\u201d Chen said. \u201cIf you just think about what candidates have done in recent cycles. I keep thinking of Herman Cain and 9-9-9,\u201d referring to the former GOP presidential candidate\u2019s proposal for a uniform 9 percent tax rate on business transactions, income and sales.\n\n( PHOTOS: Rand Paul\u2019s career)\n\nCriticizing NSA hasn\u2019t just been good politics for Paul. Some Democrats are benefiting, too.\n\nColorado Sen. Mark Udall, an Intelligence Committee member, is trying to use his outspoken critiques of NSA to appeal to western voters in his tight reelection race this November. A recent Udall campaign email to supporters included a note that he\u2019d been pushing on the issue \u201clong before it became a national debate last summer.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a fight for the independents, most of whom are on any measure suspicious of intrusive government,\u201d said former Sen. Gary Hart, a Colorado Democrat who served on a landmark Senate panel in 1975 that investigated government intelligence abuses.\n\nUdall\u2019s stance questioning the NSA \u201cshows courage,\u201d Hart added. \u201cIt demonstrates a willingness to stand up to authority, including your own administration of your own party, plus the institution of the Senate and to take a stand very few are willing to take.\u201d\n\nFor Amash, criticizing the government\u2019s surveillance programs has helped build the national profile of a two-term tea party congressman who\u2019s been best known for voting no on nearly every bill to hit the House floor.\n\nAfter forcing a floor debate in July on an amendment of his own to curtail the NSA programs \u2014 he lost by the narrowest of margins, 205-217 \u2014 Amash saw his list of followers grow well beyond his western Michigan district. In the final quarter of 2013, he reported raising a personal record of more than $518,000 \u2014 almost all of which came in small contributions from individual donors. According to Amash\u2019s office, he ranked behind only House Speaker John Boehner and Rep. Paul Ryan in donations from individual donors.\n\n\u201cThe politics of this are great for us,\u201d said Amash spokesman Will Adams.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Politicians have a long history of scoring points when government surveillance goes overboard.", "og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "Politicians have a long history of scoring points when government surveillance goes overboard.", "title": "Snowden still stirring the political pot", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2014/03/edward-snowden-still-stirring-the-political-pot-104468.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2014/03/09/edward_snowden_signs_getty_605.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "keywords": "Edward Snowden,Justin Amash,Spying,2016 Elections,National Security Agency,Rand Paul,NSA", "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/darrensamuelsohn"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8829\"", "article_summary": "Snowden still stirring the political potEdward Snowden may be living on the lam in Russia, but he continues to be a lightning rod in American politics.\nPaul\u2019s forays into national security have been one of the key features of his short Senate career.\n( PHOTOS: 15 great quotes on NSA spying)Americans may still be divided over whether Snowden is a whistleblower or a traitor.\nThey\u2019ll get another opportunity Monday when Snowden is scheduled to address via videoconference the South by Southwest festival in Austin, Texas.\nBig Brother critics see a big political payoff if they can keep riding Snowden\u2019s coattails."}
