I use to flip houses...[this] was a task I was willing to take one that no one else was,\" Henderson said.\n\nHe says he is trying to clean up the park and enforce park rules of cleanliness and rent payments.\n\n\"I am the only guy they got down there that is willing to work with them and a lot of the tenants don't really have anywhere else to go. I've got the majority of those tenants down there owe me thousands of dollars back rent,\" Henderson said.\n\nHe says the sewer is now fixed.\n\nFor residents, the KDHE says to do the following to ensure they do not get sick from the water.\n\nBoil water for one minute prior to drinking or food preparation, or use bottled water; Dispose of ice cubes and do not use ice from a household automatic icemaker; Disinfect dishes and other food contact surfaces by immersion for at least one minute in clean tap water that contains one teaspoon of unscented household bleach per gallon of water; Water used for bathing does not generally need to be boiled.
