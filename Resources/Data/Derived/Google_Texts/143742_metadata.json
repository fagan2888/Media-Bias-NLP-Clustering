Are smartphones taking a toll on their developing brains? (Yes, again.) And why did schools cancel gym and end recess when every shred of research shows that\u2019s exactly what kids need in order to learn better, stay alert and handle stress? (Oops. A huge mistake.) The more we learn about the challenges kids are facing, the more I\u2019m motivated to re-issue the Theoretical University of Wellness\u2019s first five Golden Rules of parenting, a juicy back-to-school guide to the trying task of guiding your child\u2019s hood.\n\nEat real food. You are the most important teacher your child has. If you eat well, so will they ... eventually. Some will rebel, of course, and bury Oreos in their backpacks, but all the research shows that parents are vital role models for their kids. So dig down and walk the talk: Read labels, learn to cook, limit sugar, and serve up a lot of plants, not things that were made in plants. Kiddy see, kiddy do.\n\nTake action. It\u2019s never too late to clean up your act, not to mention your pantry. Declare your house to be a processed-food-free zone \u2014 neon magic markers are made for this \u2014 and engage your kids in the game of getting rid of stuff with ingredients they can\u2019t pronounce. For extra credit, start your kids growing some food: Small pots of delicious things like cherry tomatoes can cultivate healthy changes in eating habits.\n\nAs you\u2019re roasting your kale chips, explain to them that most foods and drinks in school vending machines are \u201cthe enemy.\u201d Let your little ones know that this new \u201creal food\u201d policy is irreversible, with one exception, described below.\n\nHonor the 80-20 rule. No one\u2019s perfect, and striving for perfection is what gives us headaches, back aches and sleepless nights. So as part of your kitchen makeover, set aside a corner shelf for special treats. (I can find my blue corn tortilla chips in the dark.) It\u2019s all part of the brilliant and simple 80-20 rule: 80 percent of the time you eat real food \u2014 vegetables, fruits, nuts, beans, whole grains, healthy fats and fish, limited high-quality meats \u2014 and 20 percent of the time, you\u2019re freelancing into forbidden territory. The funny thing is, after years of this, your body stops craving junk. Wait. You\u2019ll see.\n\nSo will your kids.\n\nHelp your child find her sport.\n\nThere\u2019s a sport for every child. Your job is to guide yours to the one that feels like fun and brings out the best in them.\n\nSoccer can do that, but so might Aikido. If your kid isn\u2019t wild about the traditional school sports, encourage him and especially her to explore a long list of alternatives, including wall climbing, Irish dancing and, of course, yoga.\n\nBe a cheerleader for their participation, and don\u2019t force them to be competitive. One of the biggest wins you can experience is to raise kids who are playful and active all their lives.\n\nHave a strategy for stress.\n\nWhen you\u2019re young, you need parental guidance to help you notice when stress is making you cranky or tired, and what to do about it. If your kids see you shouting, angry, drowning your stress in a gin and tonic the size of a flower vase, they won\u2019t have a clue how to deal with their own difficult moments. Try taking family instruction in meditation or mindfulness. Learning to come back to the moment \u2014 to calm our anxieties, to still our busy minds \u2014 really is child\u2019s play.\n\nMarilynn Preston is a fitness expert, personal trainer and speaker on healthy lifestyle issues.
