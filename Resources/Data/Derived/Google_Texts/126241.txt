Germany is the world’s most popular retail-expansion market, according to a new study released Wednesday by property consultancy CBRE.

About 40% of the 115 retailers world-wide polled by CBRE said they plan to open a store in Germany this year.

“Global retailers continue to be attracted to Germany largely due to the opportunity to target more than 30 large cities with high purchasing power,” said CBRE in its report.

Following Germany are the U.K., to which 33% of retailers said they would be interested in expanding, and France, which received a nod from 31%.

France’s “mature market with several strong cities and a large number of very successful shopping centers across the country” is attractive to retailers, CBRE said, with the focus being on Paris. Recent changes to rules about Sunday trading days in France also are raising the country’s appeal, with some areas now allowing 12 such days a year rather than five, and certain tourist zones letting shops stay open on Sunday all through the year.

By region, however, the results are more mixed. Retailers based in the U.S. are most interested in expanding to the Asia-Pacific region, with roughly 43% of U.S. retailers polled saying they are looking to Japan, China and Hong Kong for growth.

About 47% of retailers based in Europe, the Middle East and Africa said Germany is their top target market. Meanwhile, in the Asia-Pacific region, 50% of retailers said they are targeting South Korea.

Globally, CBRE said retail brands originating in Germany, the U.K. and the U.S. are the most active. Of the brands looking to expand overseas, 16% came from each of these, while 11% came from Italy.

“Physical stores remain the destination of choice for consumers,” said CBRE in its report. “Recognizing this, retailers continue to open stores in diverse locations.”
