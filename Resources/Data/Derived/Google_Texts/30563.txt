Kanye West not only has a strong distaste for paparazzi — a scuffle with a photog last summer left West charged with two misdemeanors, and two years probation — he also fears what will happen when they get their hands on the latest technology. Specifically, the rapper worries about drones.

A transcript from an earlier deposition was obtained by TMZ. In it the rapper apparently slams lawyer Nate Goldberg for quoting the N-word, and voiced his fears that his daughter might be electrocuted by a drone while swimming.

“Is your daughter stalked by like drones?” Kanye asks, according to TMZ. “Are there drones flying where she’s trying to learn how to swim at age 1?

“Wouldn’t you like to just teach your daughter how to swim without a drone flying?” Kanye continued. “What happens if a drone falls right next to her? Would it electrocute her?
