Donohue complained in an email. \"The president\u2019s hurry-up approach of executive orders and rushed rulemakings is no way to govern a representative democracy.\"\n\nBut Obama, facing a Congress that will likely be in a less bipartisan mood than in 2015, is undeterred. \"I plan on doing everything I can,\" he said Dec. 18, \"with every minute of every day that I have left as president to deliver on behalf of the American people.\"\n\nThe mid-May deadline isn\u2019t statutory or in any way official, but neither is it arbitrary. It arises from the Congressional Review Act, a 1996 law that gives Congress 60 legislative days to veto, by a special swift procedure, any regulation it dislikes before the rule takes effect.\n\nThe president may veto Congress\u2019s veto, as Obama did the one time he faced this situation. But if the 60-day period extends past the inauguration of a new president, and if that president is of the opposing party \u2014 a President Donald Trump, say, or Ted Cruz or Marco Rubio \u2014 any resolution of disapproval against his predecessor will surely go unchallenged.\n\nThat worry isn\u2019t theoretical. Early in 2001, incoming President George W. Bush let stand a resolution of disapproval against an ergonomics rule that OSHA was foolish enough to issue two months before Bill Clinton vacated the West Wing. The regulation vanished into thin air.\n\nBut don\u2019t 60 days after mid-May take you to mid-July rather than late January 2016? No, because these are legislative days, which typically come only three per week, in weeks numbering far fewer than 52. The partisan gridlock of recent years has shortened the legislative calendar even further.\n\nIt was Sam Batkins, director of regulatory policy at the conservative American Action Forum, who examined preliminary House and Senate calendars for 2016, drawing on what he modestly calls his \u201cshoddy math skills,\u201d and decreed that any regulation issued on May 18 or later would be vulnerable to a congressional resolution of disapproval fielded by Obama\u2019s successor.\n\nThat deadline is a soft one, because Congress might push the May deadline back by adding, for instance, a lame-duck session after the 2016 election. But Ronald White, who is director of regulatory policy at the liberal Center for Effective Government \u2014 and doesn\u2019t agree with Batkins about much \u2014 endorses his mid-May deadline as the most plausible and prudent one to eliminate any possibility of congressional reversal.\n\nHere\u2019s a rundown of Obama\u2019s better bets:\n\nGun control: In the aftermath of mass shootings in San Bernardino, Calif., Colorado Springs, Colo., and Charleston, S.C., the Obama administration has been \u201cscrubbing\u201d the books for possible executive actions, given Congress\u2019s reluctance to enact any form of gun control. This week it's expected to tweak an existing BATFE rule to require more gun sellers to get a license \u2014 and therefore do background checks on customers no matter where they sell. The \u201cengaged in the business rule\u201d requires sellers to get a license if gun sales is their \u201clivelihood,\u201d but the rule is comically vague about what \u201clivelihood\u201d might mean in this context (\u201cthe repetitive purchase and resale of firearms\u201d).\n\nObama may clarify the definition to include any guns sold in their original packaging or re-sold shortly after they're acquired. Alternatively, he may have it turn on how many guns are put up for sale, or on whether more than 25 guns are sold in a given year. A numerical limit, though, might require drafting a regulation, which would likely stretch beyond the soft May deadline. (A regulation traveling through the bureaucracy at breakneck pace can be finalized in perhaps a year.) The likeliest possibility is that Obama will offer a so-called \"factor test\" that will lay out a variety of criteria to indicate whether a seller is likely to need a license.\n\nIn addition, BATFE may soon finalize an August 2014 rule requiring all licensed dealers and manufacturers to report as missing to federal authorities any guns that are stolen in transit to a buyer. (Stealing unregistered guns is easier than stealing registered ones because they're harder to trace.)\n\nNutritional labeling: In March 2014, Michelle Obama held a ceremony in the East Wing to introduce a design overhaul of food nutrition labels. These were so confusing, she said, that \u201cunless you had a thesaurus, a calculator, a microscope or a degree in nutrition, you were out of luck.\u201d The most controversial proposed change was a new requirement that the labels disclose how much sugar food makers added to their products.\n\nMuch of the food industry opposes the plan, arguing that it will confuse consumers. The American Sugar Association has all but threatened to sue over the change. But two food behemoths \u2013 Nestl\u00e9 and Mars \u2014 support the change, saying more transparency is good, and that added sugar is a problem in the American diet.\n\nThe rule would also update serving sizes for some products to bring them closer to the amounts people actually consume. The serving size for ice cream, as an example, would go from half a cup to a full cup, doubling the number of calories per serving. And speaking of calories, the FDA has proposed enlarging their font size on food labels.\n\nThe final nutrition reg is expected in March, at an estimated one-time cost to the industry, the FDA says, of $2.3 billion (and a benefit estimated at $21.1 billion to $31.4 billion over 20 years).\n\nE-cigarettes: The FDA also has in the works a rule extending its jurisdiction to e-cigarettes, which have become wildly popular with teenagers. (Last spring the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that e-cigarette use by high school students tripled in 2014 to 13.4 percent.) The rule, which may ban the use of e-cigarettes by anyone under the age of 18, was first proposed 20 months ago, and a final version has been awaiting clearance from the Office of Management and Budget since October. \u201cThey\u2019re being marketed to youth,\" says the Center for Effective Government's White. \"It\u2019s a huge problem.\u201d Depending on the final composition of the rule, which may regulate other new tobacco products as well, its cost over 20 years could be anywhere from $20 million to $810 million, which might well put e-cigarettes out of business.\n\nRetirement advice: By the end of March, the Labor Department is expected to publish a regulation requiring brokers who offer advice about retirement investments to do something that many assume (incorrectly) they have to do already: namely, consider only the best interests of the investor. In fact, the brokers often take into account fees and commissions to steer customers into one investment or another. The White House Council of Economic Advisers calculates that such conflicts of interest fleece consumers of about $17 billion annually. The Labor Department calculates that complying with the rule will cost industry $2.4 billion to $5.7 billion over 10 years.\n\nThe financial industry, congressional Republicans, and even some Democrats oppose the \u201cfiduciary rule\u201d on the grounds that it will make it more difficult for investors to acquire investment advice at a cost they can afford. \u201cI will continue this fight until the rule is delayed, dismantled and defeated,\u201d Rep. Ann Wagner (R-Mo.) said in December. Wagner authored a bill to halt the rule that cleared the House in October.\n\nSupporters expect the final rule to be softened for businesses. Changes that expand exemptions for small businesses, simplify disclosure, and broaden the definition of what\u2019s financial \u201ceducation\u201d and not \u201cadvice\u201d are top fixes that the Chamber of Commerce seeks that won\u2019t likely trouble the rule\u2019s advocates. \u201cFirms\u2019 ability to market their services without triggering investment advice, they\u2019ll fix that,\u201d said Barbara Roper, an official with the Consumer Federation of America, a liberal-leaning advocacy group. \u201cThat does not undermine protections for investors,\u201d she said.\n\nBut the threat of a lawsuit to hangs over even a modified rule. \u201cOur sense is that the effort to combat the DOL\u2019s fiduciary standard rule will move to the courts following its final release\" in the first quarter of 2016, Isaac Boltansky, an analyst with Compass Point LLC, said in a Dec. 16 research note.\n\nEnergy efficiency: The Energy Department is working on dozens of new or updated efficiency standards for computers, gas furnaces, dishwashers, pool heaters, air conditioners, walk-in coolers and freezers, vending machines, ceiling fans, fluorescent lamp ballast, boilers, ovens, and hearths. The efficiency measures don't typically generate much attention because they\u2019re, well, just a little bit boring, even to POLITICO Pro\u2019s intrepid policy jocks. But they\u2019re expected to save consumers a lot of money, and also \u2014 along with already-completed rules on ice makers, industrial lamps, electric motors, and other products \u2014 to generate roughly half the carbon emissions cuts that the Obama administration pledged to deliver before the Paris climate talks.\n\nThe energy standards can also be rather expensive, a fact that\u2019s caught the eye of the American Action Forum. The furnace rule\u2019s cost will vary according to region and furnace type, but AAC\u2019s Dan Batkins puts it at $741 million annually, making this \u2014 to industry, anyway \u2014 the most costly regulation in the pre-May 18 batch.\n\nTeacher prep: The Education Department is set to publish as early as this month a long-delayed and contentious final rule overhauling how teachers are prepared for the classroom. The rule would cut off federal funding for any teacher prep programs that prepared their graduates poorly.\n\nThe Education Department said last year that implementing the rule would cost states and providers $42 million over 10 years (possibly less due to \u201cdue to technology and other efficiencies\u201d). But advocacy groups, states, and teacher prep programs complain that it will cost far more; for example, the California Commission on Teacher Credentialing said it could cost the state $485 million just in the first year.\n\nWorkplace hazards: OSHA has been working quite literally for decades on a regulation that would lower drastically the permissible exposure limit to crystalline silica. The construction industry has fought the rule tooth and nail, citing its high cost; health advocates have fought just as hard in favor, citing the severe health consequences of a high exposure limit, which include lung cancer. In September 2013, OSHA proposed a rule that would reduce the permissible exposure limit to 50 micrograms per cubic meter. OSHA estimates the rule will save more than 600 lives and prevent more than 1,500 new cases of silicosis each year. The construction industry, the foundry industry and other businesses oppose the rule, saying OSHA has vastly underestimated (at $637-$658 million) its implementation costs.\n\nGitmo: On his first day in office Obama ordered that the terrorist prison at the U.S. naval base in Guant\u00e1namo Bay, Cuba, be shuttered. The prison, established by President George W. Bush early in 2002 to hold Al Qaeda and Taliban prisoners for trial by military tribunal, had drawn condemnation from the international community and human rights groups. But the closure didn\u2019t happen, because Congress moved immediately to bar any Gitmo inmates from being transferred to the U.S., or any new prison facilities built to house them. Eventually it was worked out that the Obama administration would furnish Congress with a plan for closing the prison. But the White House earlier last month rejected as too expensive a draft road map to transfer Guant\u00e1namo\u2019s remaining inmates to one of several federal prisons or military facilities in Kansas, Colorado, or South Carolina, and sent it back to the Pentagon for revisions.\n\nMany of the remaining 107 detainees are slated to be sent to other countries, and some face military prosecutions. But at least several dozen are likely to remain in custody because the U.S. government deems them too dangerous to release, or lacks sufficient evidence (or will) to prosecute them.\n\nThe big question for this year is whether Obama will try to go around Congress in a last-ditch attempt to close the prison by invoking his executive authority as commander-in-chief. Last month Cliff Sloan, who served as special envoy for Guant\u00e1namo closure from 2013 to 2014, and Gregory Craig, Obama\u2019s White House counsel in the first term, wrote in an op-ed that \u201cUnder Article II of the Constitution, the president has exclusive authority to determine the facilities in which military detainees are held. Obama has the authority to move forward. He should use it.\u201d\n\nAt a December 18 press conference, Obama indicated that he\u2019ll send proposed legislation to Capitol Hill first, then ponder his unilateral options should that gambit fail. If he proceeds, Obama\u2019s most valuable Gitmo ally\u2014his 2008 adversary John McCain, who shares Obama's desire to close the prison--may then become his chief obstacle. That\u2019s because McCain has threatened to sue if Obama bypasses Congress. Should that occur, we\u2019ll see a rematch of Obama v. McCain \u2014 though possibly with neither man in residence at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave.\n\nBrian Bender, Paul Demko, Caitlin Emma, Alex Guill\u00e9n, Jason Huffman, Marianne LeVine, Brett Norman, Patrick Temple-West and Sarah Wheaton contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Agenda", "description": "The calendar says there are 13 months left to Barack Obama's presidency.
