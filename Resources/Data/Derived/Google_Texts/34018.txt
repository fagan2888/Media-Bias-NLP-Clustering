The Larimer County Sheriff's Office arrested one man and one woman Saturday in connection with an armed robbery Friday evening.

Kira Abbott and Elijah Altergott are facing charges of aggravated robbery, a class 3 felony, and theft, a class 1 misdemeanor.

The Sheriff's Office received a call about an armed robbery at about 7 p.m. Friday. A 45-year-old man was in his room at America's Best Value Inn, 4333 E. Mulberry St. in Fort Collins, with a woman he met on a dating site after the two had dinner, according to a Sheriff's Office news release.

Abbott sent a text message right after getting into the room, according to officials, and then went to open the room door where Altergott was allegedly waiting. Abbott, the release stated, then allegedly pointed a gun at the victim and took his wallet.
