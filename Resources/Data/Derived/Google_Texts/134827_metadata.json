The test server should not have been connected to the Internet, he said, and it came from the manufacturer with a default password that had not been changed. In addition, he said, the server was not subject to regular security scans as it should have been. The security of HealthCare.gov, which serves residents of 36 states, has been a major concern for some members of Congress, particularly Republicans. Congressional investigators found that administration officials, eager to begin enrollment on Oct. 1, activated the website even though its security had not been fully tested and did not meet federal standards. This created a potentially \u201chigh risk\u201d for the exchange, according to a memorandum prepared by security experts at the Medicare agency.", "article_metadata": {"description": "According to the HHS, no personal information was stolen from HealthCare.gov", "title": "Obamacare website hacked in \u201cdenial of service\u201d attack", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "According to the HHS, no personal information was stolen from HealthCare.gov", "title": "Obamacare website hacked in \u201cdenial of service\u201d attack", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/09/05/obamacare_website_hacked_in_denial_of_service_attack/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/09/shutterstock_166155479.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "According to the HHS, no personal information was stolen from HealthCare.gov", "title": "Obamacare website hacked in \u201cdenial of service\u201d attack", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/09/shutterstock_166155479.jpg", "creator": "@@joannarothkopf", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Joanna Rothkopf", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, hackers, Healthcare.gov, Obamacare, Security", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd51c8\"", "article_summary": "This created a potentially \u201chigh risk\u201d for the exchange, according to a memorandum prepared by security experts at the Medicare agency.\nThe security of HealthCare.gov, which serves residents of 36 states, has been a major concern for some members of Congress, particularly Republicans.\nTopics: hackers, Healthcare.gov, Obamacare, Security, Innovation News, Sustainability News, News, Politics NewsOn Thursday, White House officials announced that the government\u2019s online health insurance marketplace, and object of misplaced conservative rage, HealthCare.gov, had been hacked, although no personal information was taken.\nIn addition, he said, the server was not subject to regular security scans as it should have been.\nCongressional investigators found that administration officials, eager to begin enrollment on Oct. 1, activated the website even though its security had not been fully tested and did not meet federal standards."}
