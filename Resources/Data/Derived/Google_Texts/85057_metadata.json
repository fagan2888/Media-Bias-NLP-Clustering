Many of the attendees fall into the infamous \u201ccoverage gap,\u201d created by the new healthcare law \u2014 making \u201ctoo much\u201d to qualify for Medicaid, but \u201ctoo little\u201d to afford healthcare through state or federal exchanges.\n\nDaisy Ramirez, 25, a part-time caregiver from Blue Springs, was introduced on the House and Senate floors as just one example of the many Missourians that fall within the coverage gap. Advocates told The Missouri Times that it was there hope that lawmakers would be more open to Medicaid expansion discussions when a \u201chuman face\u201d is placed on the problem.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of people that are here to support [expansion] and really need it,\u201d Ramirez said.\n\nRamirez suffers from rheumatoid arthritis and lupus, but does not qualify for Medicaid. Her condition makes finding and keeping full-time work difficult, and she doesn\u2019t make enough to afford insurance through federal exchanges.\n\nRamirez visited with her lawmakers, including Sen. Will Kraus, R-Blue Springs, which she said was an effort to \u201cput a face,\u201d on the issue.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a lot harder to say no to someone when you\u2019re standing in front of them,\u201d Ramirez said.\n\nKraus commented on the visit.\n\n\u201cToday, two constituents visited my office to discuss Medicaid,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cOne was in the coverage gap, and spoke passionately about expansion. I welcome her views and those other constituents who support expansion. We also had a visit from a local provider of home care. Their clients, mostly disabled, are having significantly more problems getting on or staying on Medicaid. The system is clearly broken. I don\u2019t believe that adding 300,000 Missourians to a broken system is compassionate. Let\u2019s reform Medicaid in Missouri first.\u201d\n\nAt a press conference later, expansion supporters brought forward several speakers, many of whom suffer from chronic health issues and have no health insurance because of the infamous coverage gap.\n\nThe event comes just weeks into a legislative session in which Republicans in leadership in both chambers have called expansion a \u201cnon-starter,\u201d and the same day that House Minority Leader Jacob Hummel, D-St. Louis, formally filed a bill to expand Medicaid.\n\nRep. Deb Lavender, D-Kirkwod, attended the press conference. Lavender said that she was optimistic that \u201cone day,\u201d Missouri would expand Medicaid to those in the gap.\n\n\u201cI came here to show my support and to show that there are people in this building who support these efforts,\u201d Lavender said.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Missouri Times", "description": "JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. \u2014 A coalition of advocates pressing lawmakers to expand Missouri Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act putting new emphasis on Missourians that fall within the \u201ccoverage gap,\u201d crowded hallways in the Capitol today.
