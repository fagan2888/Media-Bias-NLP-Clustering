PARIS (AP) — The Paris mayor’s race will give the city a new leader for the first time in 13 years and is offering a chance to reimagine one of the world’s top tourist destinations.

No one — neither Parisians nor visitors — wants a complete transformation. It’s not by accident that Paris barely looks different from the 19th century, when Emperor Napoleon III came up with a grand plan for grand boulevards and low, white stone buildings.

But the two leading candidates in elections starting Sunday — Socialist Anne Hidalgo and conservative longshot Nathalie Kosciusko-Morizet, known as NKM among the initial-loving French — see room for improvement. Here are their visions:

THE METRO

The first subway trains leave around 5:30 a.m. and the last around 12:30 a.m — a frustrating schedule for people who come to Paris for the nightlife. Both candidates have proposed expanding the hours. The conservative’s plans would match London’s, where plans are to have the Tube run around the clock on weekends beginning in 2015.

THE METRO YOU DON’T SEE

Paris also has 10 abandoned subway stations — mostly unseen, as the trains hurtle through their darkened tunnels. NKM has a futuristic plan to transform these stations into public spaces like a swimming pool, performance hall or restaurant.

MORE SHOPPING, EIFFEL TOWER REDO

Paris turns quiet on Sundays — most stores are closed, and those that are open tend to shut down shortly after lunch. NKM wants to expand the city’s relatively small tourist zones where Sunday openings are permitted and allow department stores, grocers and public swimming pools to stay open later. She’s also in favor of expanded hours for luxury shopping districts.
