He knows the story ends with Sam liking green eggs and ham. But to Cruz this isn\u2019t a contradiction. It\u2019s his main point.\n\nTed Cruz, like a lot of Republicans, is afraid that Americans might actually like Obamacare.\n\nAnd Cruz is trying to stop the program before it begins to be fully implemented in one week.\n\nThat\u2019s why Republicans won\u2019t simply let health care reform move forward, and if people don\u2019t like it, repeal it. They need to repeal it now because they know people might actually end up liking it. And then, as Cruz notes below, it will be impossible to repeal.\n\nAs Tommy Christopher over at Mediaite noted, Cruz has made a similar point before in a July interview with Fox\u2019s Sean Hannity:\n\nRight before he bragged that he isn\u2019t \u201chousetrained,\u201d Cruz laid out the Green Eggs and Ham scenario, telling Hannity \u201cIf we don\u2019t do it (defund Obacare) now, in all likelihood, Obamacare will never, ever be repealed. Why is that? Because on January 1, the exchanges kick in, the subsidies kick in,\u201d and added that \u201ctheir plan is to get the American people addicted to the sugar, addicted to the subsidies, and once that happens, in all likelihood, it never gets\u2026\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s over,\u201d Hannity cut in, \u201cit never gets repealed.\u201d\n\nAnd there\u2019s the rub.\n\nIf the Affordable Care Act were the disaster that Republicans claim it is, then it would be easy to repeal. Americans would be clamoring for its repeal. But they\u2019re not, because it\u2019s not a disaster yet. And as Ted Cruz, and even Sean Hannity admit, once Obamacare is fully implemented, more than enough Americans are going to like it, and that\u2019s going to ensure that Obamacare is never repealed.\n\nAnd even Cruz\u2019 specific argument about the \u201csubsidies\u201d buying people off contradicts the standard GOP talking points. I thought we were told the subsidies wouldn\u2019t be enough? And that prices for health insurance would go through the roof. And that people would lose their health insurance at their current employer. If all of that were going to happen, people would gladly demand that Obamacare be repealed. The only way Ted Cruz\u2019 fears come true, the only way that the American people refuse to support a repeal of Obamacare, is if Obamacare actually works.\n\nAnd that is the Republican party\u2019s greatest fear.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Republican Senator Ted Cruz is filibustering Obamacare because he fears that the public might actually like health care reform once it's fully implemented.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "AMERICAblog News", "description": "Republican Senator Ted Cruz is filibustering Obamacare because he fears that the public might actually like health care reform once it's fully implemented.", "title": "Ted Cruz admits Americans will like Obamacare", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://americablog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/like-green-eggs-and-ham2.jpg", "updated_time": "2013-09-25T12:03:37-04:00", "url": "http://americablog.com/2013/09/ted-cruz-afraid-americans-will-like-obamacare.html", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Republican Senator Ted Cruz is filibustering Obamacare because he fears that the public might actually like health care reform once it's fully implemented.", "creator": "@aravosis", "image": "http://americablog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/like-green-eggs-and-ham2.jpg", "title": "Ted Cruz admits Americans will like Obamacare", "site": "@americablog", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "p": {"domain_verify": "6a65cadbb06b6a8cd2795a412c36d6b4"}, "fb": {"admins": 504024627}, "google-site-verification": "LrdwJVMR_suty6YsOZ4xc1Hv3-F8Ms0Wo-VhCAoXm_U", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/AMERICAblog", "published_time": "2013-09-25T11:43:20-04:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/aravosis", "section": "News", "modified_time": "2013-09-25T12:03:37-04:00", "tag": "Video"}, "news_keywords": "ACA, Dr. Seuss, filibuster, Green Eggs and Ham, health care reform, Obamacare, Ted Cruz, Video"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdab91\"", "article_summary": "The only way Ted Cruz\u2019 fears come true, the only way that the American people refuse to support a repeal of Obamacare, is if Obamacare actually works.\nTed Cruz, like a lot of Republicans, is afraid that Americans might actually like Obamacare.\nAnd as Ted Cruz, and even Sean Hannity admit, once Obamacare is fully implemented, more than enough Americans are going to like it, and that\u2019s going to ensure that Obamacare is never repealed.\nWhen you cut through the presidential-hopeful-pandering side of Ted Cruz\u2019 faux filibuster of Obamacare that\u2019s currently taking place live on the US Senate floor, you come to the conclusion that the man thinks the greatest risk from Obamacare is that the public might actually like it.\nThat\u2019s why Cruz recently read Dr. Seuss\u2019 story, \u201cGreen Eggs and Ham\u201d during the filibuster (see video below)."}
