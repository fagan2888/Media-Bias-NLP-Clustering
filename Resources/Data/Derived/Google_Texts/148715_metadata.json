Right-hander Jordan Lyles lasted just 2 innings against the division-leading Los Angeles Dodgers. And now Colorado\u2019s rotation is off its orbit.\n\n\u201cIt was unacceptable,\u201d Lyles said.\n\nLyle\u2019s sideways start started a week of rejiggering. Jorge De La Rosa, who was set to start Monday, instead was bumped to Tuesday because of stomach flu, the team said.\n\nChad Bettis will instead start Monday on normal rest. But that was manager Walt Weiss\u2019 third option.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re talking about bumping him back a couple days,\u201d Weiss said before Sunday\u2019s game, a 12-10 loss to the Dodgers. \u201cThat was one of the scenarios. We have a Plan B we\u2019ll kick around.\u201d\n\nPlan A was to move De La Rosa to Wednesday, let long-reliever Chris Rusin pitch Monday and keep Bettis on his regularly scheduled Tuesday.\n\nRockies Mailbag: Pose a question for Patrick Saunders\n\nBut Rusin was called into duty Sunday in relief of Lyles. And De La Rosa remained too ill to pitch Monday, Weiss\u2019 Plan B.\n\nEstevez\u2019s debut. In his big-league debut Saturday, 23-year-old right-hander Carlos Estevez blew through the Dodgers for two hitless innings. But he stopped long enough to savor the scene.\n\n\u201cAfter my last warm-up pitch, I walked around the mound, looked up everywhere. And I took a deep breath and said: \u2018This is it. Here\u2019s where I wanted to be,\u2019 Estevez said.\n\n\u201cIt was really exciting to play in front of so many people.\u201d\n\nEstevez said he was surprised the Rockies called him up so soon this season, but he was prepared. And at 6-foot-4, 210 pounds, Estevez fills the need for a hard-throwing reliever.\n\nCarGo cares. Carlos Gonzalez dived into the stands down the right-field line Sunday chasing a flyball. But when he tumbled over the wall, his spikes clipped a young girl. The last he saw of her, she was bleeding from the head.\n\n\u201cI called the trainers over to her,\u201d Gonzalez said. \u201cThey said she is fine. I\u2019ll try to give her a little present.\u201d\n\nFootnotes. Charlie Blackmon (turf toe) ran the bases in spikes for the first time Sunday. \u201cBest-case scenario is we\u2019ll see him in Arizona,\u201d Weiss said of the Rockies\u2019 next road trip, starting April 29. \u2026 Catcher Nick Hundley (concussion) played seven innings in a Triple-A rehab game in Las Vegas and had an RBI single. He\u2019s likely to be activated Monday.

In his last outing, a six-inning loss at Cincinnati, he got through six innings without a walk. Bettis was scheduled to start Tuesday, with an extra day of rest after a team day off last week. But the Rockies moved him up to help Jorge De La Rosa (stomach flu).\n\nTuesday: Pirates RHP Gerrit Cole (1-2, 2.70 ERA) at Rockies LHP Jorge De La Rosa (1-2, 9.87), 6:40 p.m., ROOT\n\nWednesday: Pirates LHP Jon Niese (3-0, 4.24) at Rockies Jon Gray (0-0, 9.00), 6:40 p.m., ROOT\n\nThursday: Pirates RHP Juan Nicasio (2-2, 4.50) at Rockies RHP Tyler Chatwood (2-2, 3.47), 1:10 p.m., ROOT", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Jordan Lyles\u2019 rough start sets off rotation changes", "title": "Jordan Lyles\u2019 rough start sets off rotation changes", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/04/24/jordan-lyles-rough-start-sets-off-rotation-changes/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160424__Jordan-Lylesp1.jpg", "height": 439}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160424__Jordan-Lylesp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2016-04-24T21:08:37+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-25T19:38:59+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Jorge De La Rosa, who was set to start Monday, instead was bumped to Tuesday because of stomach flu, the team said.\nBut the Rockies moved him up to help Jorge De La Rosa (stomach flu).\nAnd De La Rosa remained too ill to pitch Monday, Weiss\u2019 Plan B.Estevez\u2019s debut.\nBettis was scheduled to start Tuesday, with an extra day of rest after a team day off last week.\nRight-hander Jordan Lyles lasted just 2 innings against the division-leading Los Angeles Dodgers."}
