It\u2019s even worse that they overcharged the federal government hundreds of millions of dollars for their \u201cwork\u201d \u2013 and agency officials didn\u2019t notice any of it.\n\nRelated: House GOP Ready to Play Chicken with Obama over DHS Funding\n\nA new management advisory from the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s Inspector General takes the CBP to task for failing to sufficiently oversee a nearly $1 billion contract with Defense Support Services for year-round maintenance work on the agency\u2019s aircraft fleet.\n\nThe contract, originally worth $938 million, ballooned by $118 million to exceed $1 billion. Although CBP ended up paying more than they had agreed to pay \u2013 they got significantly less for it.\n\nThe original contract awarded in 2009, required contractors to maintain 265 airplanes and helicopters \u2013 routine work that included flying them a total of 100,000 hours a year. Between 2010 and 2013, however, the contractors reduced the number of planes they were working on by 13 percent and decreased the number of total flight hours by 35 percent.\n\n\u201cSince 2009, the number of CBP aircraft maintained, annual flight hours and the average age of CBP\u2019s aircraft fleet decreased,\u201d the auditors said in the report. Yet the maintenance contract costs still rose.\n\nThe auditors also found some potentially serious maintenance issues. Some planes had unsecured bolts; one plane suffered severe damage; and one helicopter\u2019s rotor blades had been incorrectly attached.\n\nThe IG blamed the Border Patrol agency for failing to flag these issues and for not having sufficient procedures in place to review the contractor\u2019s work. Such a lack of strategy opens the door to more problems, auditors said, including safety problems.\n\nEarlier this month, the IG slammed the same agency\u2019s drone program for being ineffective despite costing $360 million so far.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "It\u2019s bad enough that federal contractors hired to perform routine maintenance work on", "title": "$1 Billion Paid for Loose Bolts and Damaged Aircraft", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/01/27/1-Billion-Paid-Loose-Bolts-and-Damaged-Aircraft", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/01272014_Border_Patrol_Helicopter.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/01/27/1-Billion-Paid-Loose-Bolts-and-Damaged-Aircraft", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/01272014_Border_Patrol_Helicopter.jpg", "creator": "@Briannaehley", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "It\u2019s bad enough that federal contractors hired to perform routine maintenance work on", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2162\"", "article_summary": "\u201cSince 2009, the number of CBP aircraft maintained, annual flight hours and the average age of CBP\u2019s aircraft fleet decreased,\u201d the auditors said in the report.\nThe IG blamed the Border Patrol agency for failing to flag these issues and for not having sufficient procedures in place to review the contractor\u2019s work.\nYet the maintenance contract costs still rose.\nIt\u2019s bad enough that federal contractors hired to perform routine maintenance work on Customs and Border Patrol (CBP) airplanes dodged their work hours and shirked important safety requirements.\nThe contract, originally worth $938 million, ballooned by $118 million to exceed $1 billion."}
