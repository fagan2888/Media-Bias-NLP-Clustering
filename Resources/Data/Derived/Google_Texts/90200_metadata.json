That means new appointments for check-ups are on the books. And it means the peace of mind, security, and dignity that comes with taking your health care into your own hands.\u201d\n\nPresident Obama, currently on vacation in Hawaii, also shared a success story via Twitter: \u201cI signed the ACA for kids like Marcelas Owens. He lost his mom bc she couldn't afford coverage. Today millions of Americans finally can,\u201d he wrote.\u201d\n\nOwens, whose uninsured mother died of a treatable illness at the age of 27, became the face of the Affordable Care Act during debate over the legislation. When Mr. Obama signed the bill into law in 2010, Owens (then 11 years old) stood by the president\u2019s side.\n\nOrganizing for Action, the nonprofit that evolved from Mr. Obama\u2019s campaign organization Obama for America, has also launched a website to promote stories from individuals who have benefited from the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\n\nNow that millions of Americans will start benefitting from coverage on the marketplaces, it\u2019s possible public views of Obamacare could improve. A CBS News/New York Times poll released in December showed that more Americans continue to disapprove (50 percent) than approve (39 percent) of the law. The intention of the Affordable Care Act may be primarily to help those without insurance obtain it, but Americans without health insurance (53 percent) are just as likely as those with insurance (51 percent) to disapprove of the law.\n\nWhile it searches for positive stories about the law, the administration is still responding to continued controversy over Obamacare and possible complications.\n\nOn Tuesday evening, Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor temporarily blocked the implementation of the Obamacare mandate for certain religious groups to provide health insurance for employees that includes birth control coverage. Sotomayor\u2019s order applies only to the organizations that requested it, the administration has until Friday morning to respond.\n\nMeanwhile, the administration has also taken steps to mitigate any problems consumers may face as they try to access their new Obamacare insurance. For instance, the administration appealed to pharmacies to accommodate patients who may have a temporary disruption in their prescription coverage -- CVS and Walgreens have plans to do so.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Opening marketplaces gives administration a chance to turn around the controversial law\u2019s image", "og": {"url": "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/white-house-solicits-feel-good-obamacare-stories/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/12/05/bc0170fa-4ceb-4a1b-bc96-4f07f35891a5/thumbnail/1200x630/b4228dbef749052d1bffc38935b7d282/obamacare-dice.jpg", "height": 630}, "type": "article", "description": "Opening marketplaces gives administration a chance to turn around the controversial law\u2019s image", "title": "White House solicits feel-good Obamacare stories"}, "twitter": {"description": "Opening marketplaces gives administration a chance to turn around the controversial law\u2019s image", "creator": "@http://twitter.com/stephcondoncbs", "app": {"url": {"ipad": "cbsnewsapp://news/white-house-solicits-feel-good-obamacare-stories/", "iphone": "cbsnewsapp://news/white-house-solicits-feel-good-obamacare-stories/", "googleplay": "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/white-house-solicits-feel-good-obamacare-stories/"}, "country": "US", "name": {"ipad": "CBS News", "iphone": "CBS News", "googleplay": "CBS News"}, "id": {"ipad": 334256223, "iphone": 334256223, "googleplay": "com.treemolabs.apps.cbsnews"}}, "title": "White House solicits feel-good Obamacare stories", "site": "@CBSPolitics", "image": "http://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/12/05/bc0170fa-4ceb-4a1b-bc96-4f07f35891a5/thumbnail/1200x630/b4228dbef749052d1bffc38935b7d282/obamacare-dice.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "index, follow", "al": {"web": {"url": "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/white-house-solicits-feel-good-obamacare-stories/"}, "android": {"app_name": "CBS News", "package": "com.treemolabs.apps.cbsnews"}, "ios": {"url": "cbsnewsapp://news/white-house-solicits-feel-good-obamacare-stories/", "app_name": "CBS News", "app_store_id": 334256223}}, "fb": {"app_id": 1536620209892267}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/CBSPolitics", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/Political-Hotsheet/"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0845\"", "article_summary": "Meanwhile, the administration has also taken steps to mitigate any problems consumers may face as they try to access their new Obamacare insurance.\nNow that the Obamacare marketplaces are open for business, the Obama administration is aiming to improve perceptions about the controversial law with its success stories.\nWhile it searches for positive stories about the law, the administration is still responding to continued controversy over Obamacare and possible complications.\nNow that millions of Americans will start benefitting from coverage on the marketplaces, it\u2019s possible public views of Obamacare could improve.\nA new page on WhiteHouse.gov allows visitors to submit their own Obamacare stories, along with their name, email address and zip code."}
