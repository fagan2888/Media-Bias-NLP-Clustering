Two-thirds of them are over age 55 and only 23 percent of Maine veterans over age 25 have bachelor\u2019s degrees, compared to 26 percent nationwide.\n\nJames Pineau, senior area manager for the Small Business Administration, left, speaks during a panel discussion about veterans\u2019 employment issues on Tuesday at the University of Maine at Augusta.

Panelists called for a concerted effort to identify small businesses that want to hire veterans with specific skill sets. Grace said government has a large role in this, but he called on employers to \u201craise the issue\u201d publicly, whether it\u2019s in public service announcements or other marketing efforts.\n\n\u201cI think that\u2019s a key way to get it done,\u201d he said.\n\nThe center\u2019s report made five suggestions to improve Maine veteran services, including expanding Medicaid coverage under the Affordable Care Act, increasing food stamp benefits, expanding education aid and tax incentive programs and improving the Maine Bureau of Veterans Services website, which doesn\u2019t mention Maine\u2019s 1985 law establishing a veteran hiring preference for state jobs.\n\nBut Eliza Quill, veterans case manager at Bread of Life, a nonprofit group that operates a veterans homeless shelter in Augusta, said a lack of public transportation, especially in the capital area, is a main concern of hers. The Kennebec Explorer runs a bus service in the area, but it doesn\u2019t run in many places past 4 p.m.\n\nMost of the shelter\u2019s residents are in their 50s and 60s, and Quill said of the 10 people there, seven don\u2019t know how to turn on a computer and haven\u2019t used them. It\u2019s often difficult for veterans to get to potential jobs, career services and health appointments, and the shelter could benefit from groups coming in to provide services, such as computer lessons.\n\n\u201cI think that we need to have more community involvement in the lives of veterans,\u201d Quill said. \u201cThat\u2019s what we need.\u201d\n\nMichael Shepherd \u2014 370-7652\n\n[email protected]\n\nTwitter: @mikeshepherdme", "article_metadata": {"description": "Veterans cite employment, housing and transportation as the main issues in the state, and experts say better communication is needed to serve them.", "generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Central Maine", "description": "Veterans cite employment, housing and transportation as the main issues in the state, and experts say better communication is needed to serve them.", "title": "Maine must better connect veterans to existing services, panel says - Central Maine", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 1000, "identifier": "http://www.centralmaine.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/392408_366381-20150512-veterans_02.jpg", "height": 773}, "updated_time": "2015-05-13T00:08:58-04:00", "url": "http://www.centralmaine.com/2015/05/12/maine-must-better-connect-veterans-to-existing-services-panel-says/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.centralmaine.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/392408_366381-20150512-veterans_02.jpg", "description": "Veterans cite employment, housing and transportation as the main issues in the state, and experts say better communication is needed to serve them.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Maine must better connect veterans to existing services, panel says - Central Maine"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=966680591", "fb": {"app_id": 754222714628811}, "article": {"section": "Local & State", "published_time": "2015-05-12T17:30:51-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-05-13T00:08:58-04:00"}, "google-site-verification": "DT-FwcrUrXtAltcTNXUsA7tR4Ha0CLErawYbGlkpg94", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Two-thirds of them are over age 55 and only 23 percent of Maine veterans over age 25 have bachelor\u2019s degrees, compared to 26 percent nationwide.\nJames Pineau, senior area manager for the Small Business Administration, left, speaks during a panel discussion about veterans\u2019 employment issues on Tuesday at the University of Maine at Augusta.\nAUGUSTA \u2014 Maine has demographic and economic challenges that make it difficult for veterans to work after returning home, but connecting them to existing services and employers is also a major problem, a panel said on Tuesday.\nStaff photo by Joe Phelan Laura Allen, chapter captain of Team Red, White & Blue Maine, center, speaks during a panel discussion about veterans\u2019 employment issues on Tuesday at the University of Maine at Augusta.\nAmy Line, veterans\u2019 success coordinator at the University of Maine at Augusta, left, and Sgt."}
