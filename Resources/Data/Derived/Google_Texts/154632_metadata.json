Gonzalez has since been sentenced to 17 months in prison and 36 months of supervised release.\n\n\u201cIt took a stunning penetration to the very interior of the White House by Omar Gonzalez last year to make it clear that reform of the Secret Service was urgent,\u201d said Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-D.C.).\n\nThe bill crafted by the House Judiciary Committee would direct the Secret Service to evaluate its use of technology and the potential for additional weaponry at the White House. It would also require the Secret Service director to be confirmed by the Senate.\n\nIt further expands requirements for Secret Service agents\u2019 training and the size of the agency workforce. The Secret Service would have to increase the annual number of hours for training officers, though the bill does not outline a specific number.\n\nThe legislation also authorizes the Secret Service to hire at least 200 more uniformed division officers and 85 new special agents. Such a provision follows the recommendation of an independent report commissioned last year by the Department of Homeland Security to hire more agents because agents are currently working for \u201can unsustainable number of hours.\u201d\n\nIn addition, the Secret Service would be authorized to build officer training facilities at the Rowley Training Center in Beltsville, Md.\n\nThe Secret Service earlier this month added metal spikes atop the White House fence on Pennsylvania Avenue as a temporary means of deterring intruders until a long-term design is implemented.\n\nThe legislation now heads to the Senate, but it\u2019s unclear if and when it will be considered.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "The legislation comes in response to a string of high-profile security incidents.", "description": "The legislation comes in response to a string of high-profile security incidents.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "rdfs": {"label skos": {"prefLabel": "Floor Action"}}, "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "The legislation comes in response to a string of high-profile security incidents.", "title": "House passes reform bill for the Secret Service", "url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/house/249365-house-passes-secret-service-reform-bill", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/thehill_logo_200.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-04T05:25:59-05:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-04T05:25-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/house/249365-house-passes-secret-service-reform-bill", "dcterms.date": "2015-07-27T19:23-04:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Cristina Marcos", "author": "Cristina Marcos", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Secret Service,,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-07-27T19:23:50-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-04T05:25:59-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/house/249365-house-passes-secret-service-reform-bill", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "The legislation comes in response to a string of high-profile security incidents.", "card": "summary", "title": "House passes reform bill for the Secret Service"}, "dcterms.title": "House passes reform bill for the Secret Service"}, "article_summary": "The bill crafted by the House Judiciary Committee would direct the Secret Service to evaluate its use of technology and the potential for additional weaponry at the White House.\nLegislation to overhaul the Secret Service easily passed the House on Monday in the aftermath of high-profile security incidents at the White House.\nIt further expands requirements for Secret Service agents\u2019 training and the size of the agency workforce.\nThe Secret Service earlier this month added metal spikes atop the White House fence on Pennsylvania Avenue as a temporary means of deterring intruders until a long-term design is implemented.\nIt would also require the Secret Service director to be confirmed by the Senate."}
