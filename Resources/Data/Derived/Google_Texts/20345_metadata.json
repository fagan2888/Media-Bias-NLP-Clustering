The extent to which the Department of Defense is overseeing the implementation of the plans is also unclear, but appears limited.\u201d\n\nIn recent weeks, there were two important developments. Twenty-nine women attempted to pass the Marine Corps\u2018 Infantry Officer Course at the combat development base in Quantico, Virginia. All failed. The Corps hoped for a much larger group of volunteers \u2014 100 or so. It says the relatively small turnout is a data point in deciding whether to recommend opening the infantry officer occupation to women.\n\nThe Army searched the ranks to find women who wanted to attempt its own grueling combat test: the Ranger course at Fort Benning, Georgia.\n\nAt the start, 113 women volunteered and entered the Ranger Training Assessment Course, a demanding, two-week exercise that also eliminates many men. Of the 113 women, 20 passed. One dropped out at the start of Ranger Course. Subsequently, the remaining 19 (16 officers and three enlisted) failed to complete the course. Of those, eight were recycled Thursday to attempt the course again, as is also permitted for men.\n\nWilliam J. Gregor, a professor of social sciences at the Army\u2019s School of Advanced Military Studies at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, has conducted studies on what he believes are the drawbacks of putting women in direct land combat. He says the Infantry Officer Course and the Ranger Course results show that the Pentagon will have to scramble to find even a small number of women who can be infantry officers and commandos \u2014 both highly demanding physical endeavors.\n\n\u201cThe question then becomes, if you are recruiting for occupational specialties, where\u2019s the next cohort? Where are the next 100 women?\u201d Mr. Gregor said. \u201cYou just culled the Army for over 100 women, so where\u2019s the next cohort? The same is true for every one of these programs.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re expending valuable training time on populations that are unlikely to succeed. So what cost do you want to bear in continually trying with these experiments? This has nothing to do with raising an army.\u201d\n\nHigh cost of training\n\nFormer Defense Secretary Leon E. Panetta announced in January 2013 that he had revoked the military\u2019s regulation against women in direct land combat. The stated goal was to create a training atmosphere in which significant numbers of women, not just an isolated few, become land combatants.\n\nMr. Gregor has his doubts that can happen unless combat physical standard are lowered, and he suspects a lowering eventually will occur. Senior Pentagon officials pledge that they are committed to keeping standards the same, or gender-neutral, but have not ruled out lowering standards.\n\nA big question is, once infantry is officially opened to women, how many teenage females will apply for that occupation?\n\n\u201cAre you going to recruit women into the infantry and then have them fail initial training?\u201d Mr. Gregor said. \u201cHow long are you going to do that before you realize the cost of doing that is too high? Not only do you lose the training slots, but once they fail, you\u2019ve go to reclassify them into a new occupational specialty. So from a manpower procurement standpoint, it doesn\u2019t make any sense.\u201d\n\nOne development that counters that argument is that a number of enlisted Marine women \u2014 120 out of 350 \u2014 were able to pass the Infantry Training Battalion Course earlier this year in a pilot program.\n\nWith officers, as the Marine Corps sees it, if infantry is opened to women and female officers first get through the Basic School, they then would be eligible to try the Infantry Officer Course.\n\nSaid Capt. Maureen T. Krebs, a Corps spokeswoman: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t characterize it as finding a \u2018pool of women\u2019 but rather female Marine lieutenants who truly want to be infantry or ground intelligence officers would have the same opportunity as the male Marines to be selected for those occupational specialties and go through the course, meet the standards of the course, graduate and lead Marines in those units.\u201d\n\nTwo female ground intelligence officers have tried the IOC and failed since the Corps opened that occupation to women in 2013. If an officer cannot pass IOC, he or she cannot become a ground intelligence officer.\n\n\u2018If you pass, you pass\u2019\n\nThe National Women\u2019s Law Center is not happy with how the Pentagon is managing the transition phase.\n\nThe center, for example, criticized the Marine Corps approach of studying whether gender-integrated combat units perform as well as all-male units. That pilot program is the ongoing Ground Combat Element Integrated Task Force, scheduled to end in July.\n\nA woman should succeed or fail on what she does individually, not as a group, the women advocate group said.\n\n\u201cThis would improperly be evaluating all women\u2019s qualifications based on the performance of a few women. Instead, both women and men should be evaluated on an individual basis \u2014 measured against valid occupational standards,\u201d the group\u2019s report said.\n\nThe report also criticizes the Army for making the Ranger Course closed to women in the first place.\n\n\u201cIf this Army assessment is intended to inform a decision on whether to recommend that Ranger units remain closed to women, it has many of the flaws of the Marine Corps\u2018 studies,\u201d the law center said. \u201cWomen are being asked to volunteer but will not be able to join a Ranger unit, even if they qualify by completing the school.\u201d\n\nOn the question of whether the military\u2019s women population will produce sufficient numbers who want to be in frontline land combat, the women's center asserted: \u201cThere is no reason for delay in assigning women in open occupations to closed units, particularly because there are many currently serving women who are highly interested in serving in a greater range of positions and units.\u201d\n\nNavy Lt. Cmdr. Nate Christensen, a Pentagon spokesman, defended how the military is moving toward combat integration.\n\n\u201cThe successful integration of women into currently closed positions requires the department to be thoughtful and deliberate,\u201d Lt. Cmdr. Christensen said. \u201cThe department is proceeding in a measured and responsible way to open positions to women. The department is committed to opening positions and occupations when and how it makes sense while preserving unit readiness, cohesion and the quality of the all-volunteer force.\u201d\n\nSince Mr. Panetta\u2019s announcement, about 91,000 previously closed positions have been opened, he said.\n\nIt is a foregone conclusion that infantry will become mixed-gender. Mr. Carter has said that most, if not all, currently closed occupations will open sometime after the studies are submitted to his staff in September.\n\nNavy Secretary Ray Mabus, who will make recommendations to Mr. Carter on Navy and Marine Corps units such as SEALs and infantry, told midshipmen last week at the Naval Academy that everyone should be given a chance.\n\n\u201cThe working assumption is all billets are going to be opened this year,\u201d Mr. Mabus said. \u201cMy notion is you set up gender-neutral standards. If you pass, you pass. I don\u2019t care what shape you are. I don\u2019t care what gender you are.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Military women washing out in two major tests this spring raises the question of whether a large enough female population exists to produce significant numbers of officers for front-line ground combat, an Army professor says.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Military women washing out in two major tests this spring raises the question of whether a large enough female population exists to produce significant numbers of officers for front-line ground combat, an Army professor says.", "title": "Women in combat: Test failures raise questions about how many can succeed", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/may/17/women-in-combat-test-failures-raise-questions-abou/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/05/17/5_172015_military8201.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/05/17/5_172015_military8201.jpg", "description": "Military women washing out in two major tests this spring raises the question of whether a large enough female population exists to produce significant numbers of officers for front-line ground combat", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Women in combat: Test failures raise questions about how many can succ"}, "Author": "Rowan Scarborough", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "War Conflict, Pentagon, Army, United States Marine Corps, Ashton Carter"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd35d\"", "article_summary": "Twenty-nine women attempted to pass the Marine Corps\u2018 Infantry Officer Course at the combat development base in Quantico, Virginia.\nThe Army searched the ranks to find women who wanted to attempt its own grueling combat test: the Ranger course at Fort Benning, Georgia.\nThe report also criticizes the Army for making the Ranger Course closed to women in the first place.\nThe center, for example, criticized the Marine Corps approach of studying whether gender-integrated combat units perform as well as all-male units.\nAt the start, 113 women volunteered and entered the Ranger Training Assessment Course, a demanding, two-week exercise that also eliminates many men."}
