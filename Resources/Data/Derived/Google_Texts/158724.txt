The Denver Elections Division has launched new smartphone and tablet apps that allow voters to register, view recent election results, see candidates and find out key voting dates.

The app — called “Denver Votes!” — is available on the Android and Apple app stores.

Colorado’s mostly mail-in ballot system means the election will get underway soon. Denver (and other counties) will mail out ballots the week of Oct. 14 for the Nov. 4 election, and in-person voter service and polling centers begin opening Oct. 20.

“The DenverVotes app will put a variety of useful information right at the voter’s fingertips,” Denver Clerk and Recorder Debra Johnson said in a news release.

Potential voters can register using the new app if they have a Colorado driver’s license. Or registered voters can check their current listing. Division spokesman Alton Dillard urged voters to check to make sure their address is up to date now to ensure they get their ballots.

According to the app, as of Friday, Denver had 466,390 registered voters, nearly 343,000 of them active. The split in affiliations among active voters: 48 percent Democratic, 16 percent Republican and 35 percent unaffiliated.
