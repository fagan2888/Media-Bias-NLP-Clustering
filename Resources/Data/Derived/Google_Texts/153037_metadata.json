Now, as the Affordable Care Act creates more options on the individual market, the question of whether to continue offering health insurance has intensified, especially for small businesses.\n\nAnd Zane Benefits is emerging as the leader of a handful of companies \u2014 including TASC, HR Simplified and Freedom Services \u2014 hoping to facilitate that transition. According to Mr. Lindquist, about 2,600 small businesses use Zane\u2019s software to create and manage health reimbursement arrangements, as these plans are commonly called \u2014 lured at least in part by the tax exclusion. Community Quick Care pays Zane $12 a month for each of its 30 employees to administer the plan. Mr. Adkins estimates that employees can buy their own plan for as much as 40 percent less than the same coverage would cost as part of a group. Should they receive government subsidies to buy that insurance \u2014 and Mr. Eledge estimated up to a quarter of his employees qualify \u2014 the savings to the employer can double, Mr. Adkins said.\n\nLawyers following the issue called Zane\u2019s approach risky at best. \u201cIt is abundantly clear that the I.R.S. thinks that you cannot use one of these arrangements to use tax-free dollars to pay for individual health insurance,\u201d said Amy B. Monahan, a law professor at the University of Minnesota.\n\nBut Mr. Perretta said the Zane plan exploited a weakness in the guidance, which does not specify whether insurance premiums are an essential health benefit. \u201cThe Zane arrangement tries to thread a needle,\u201d he said. \u201cIt really lives or dies on that ambiguity.\u201d Elsewhere, he added, the I.R.S. and other agencies have implied that a premium is not an essential health benefit, so for now, Mr. Perretta said, the Zane plan could be legal, \u201cbut regulators don\u2019t like it.\u201d\n\nOfficials from the Treasury Department and the I.R.S. declined to answer questions about the regulations or Zane\u2019s plan, but a Treasury Department official wrote in an emailed statement, \u201cThis type of reimbursement plan generally would fail to comply with the A.C.A.\u2019s prohibition on annual dollar limits.\u201d\n\nSeveral lawyers who had spoken with I.R.S. officials said the Obama administration was concerned that self-insuring companies could use the plans to shift sicker workers to the individual market, which might destabilize it. Nor do regulators want employees with tax-preferred reimbursement accounts to also have access to exchange subsidies, which the lawyers said would constitute \u201cdouble-dipping.\u201d Because the tax-free benefit would not appear on an employee\u2019s tax return, an exchange could not consider it when determining whether the employee\u2019s income was low enough to qualify for a tax credit. As a result, employees receiving reimbursements could be treated more generously by an exchange than the law intends.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn fact, it is not clear that employees who sign up for Zane\u2019s plan would be eligible for a subsidy. Zane said they would. All of the lawyers interviewed said they would not. Under the law, employers will report to the I.R.S. who has signed up for company health plans, including reimbursement arrangements. Beginning in 2016, the agency will use these employer statements to determine whether an individual who received a subsidy in the previous year was entitled to it \u2014 and if not, the employee will have to pay the government back. Said Linda Mendel, a tax lawyer with Vorys, Sater, Seymour and Pease: \u201cThere\u2019ll be some nasty surprises when all this stuff comes together in 2016.\u201d\n\nThe Treasury official said the government planned to issue further guidance on the matter. But ultimately, it may be up to one of Zane\u2019s clients to persuade a court that the arrangements are legal. The penalty for an employer violating the market reform rules is $100 a day, or $36,500 a year, for each affected employee, though never more $500,000 total.\n\nMr. Lindquist said his agents walked clients through all of the legal risks, but he was confident the plan would withstand scrutiny. \u201cIf we were worried about that, we wouldn\u2019t offer it,\u201d he said. Mr. Adkins, the insurance agent, said he told his small-business clients who had adopted Zane\u2019s software \u2014 there are 150 of them \u2014 that they had little to fear. \u201cThe purpose of the Affordable Care Act is to get people covered in this country,\u201d he said. \u201cDo you really believe the government is going to penalize that small-businessman $36,000 a year per employee because he had the heart to actually help his employees get as much coverage as they could get?\u201d\n\nAnd Mr. Eledge, of Community Quick Care, said Mr. Adkins satisfied him, and his accountant, that the plan would stand up. \u201cWe like it very clear that everything we do as a company is aboveboard and legal,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not the kind of guy who says, \u2018I.R.S., come get me.\u2019 \u201d", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20140604105842, "twitter": {"description": "The agency is frowning on a plan that promises that the insurance contribution a company makes to its employees\u2019 coverage is tax-free for the employees and excluded from payroll taxes for the employer.", "title": "Risking a Health Insurance Strategy the I.R.S.
