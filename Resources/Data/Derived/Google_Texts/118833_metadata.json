Laura Kelly, a Topeka Democrat.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been discussion of that, yes,\u201d said Rep. Don Hill, an Emporia Republican.\n\nKelly and Hill, who serve on their respective chambers\u2019 health and budget committees, declined to say which legislators are promoting the would-be deal.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s being said is that there might be an opportunity for it to be used as a lever when things get to a point of having to get some people to vote for something they wouldn\u2019t vote for otherwise,\u201d Hill said.\n\nIn recent weeks, legislators have intensified efforts to come up with more than $400 million needed to balance the state\u2019s budget for the fiscal year that begins July 1. The Kansas Constitution prohibits the state from spending more than it expects to collect in revenue.\n\nMost conservatives in the Legislature favor reducing or eliminating the state\u2019s earned income tax credit but oppose expanded eligibility for Medicaid, which was part of the Affordable Care Act. Kansas is one of 21 states that have not expanded Medicaid coverage to more low-income residents.\n\nConversely, most moderates and liberals favor Medicaid expansion and support the earned income tax credit. Conservatives control the House and Senate leadership offices.\n\nThroughout this year\u2019s legislative session, the Kansas Hospital Association has urged legislators to expand Medicaid, saying that it would close a gap in the Affordable Care Act that blocks an estimated 85,000 uninsured Kansans from being eligible for Medicaid or receiving federal subsidies for offsetting the cost of private insurance.\n\nMedicaid expansion also would benefit the state\u2019s economy and provide relief for some struggling rural hospitals, according to the hospital association.\n\nChad Austin, a senior vice president with the hospital association, confirmed that the organization has been asked to weigh in on a proposal to approve Medicaid expansion in exchange for reducing or eliminating the state\u2019s earned income tax credit, also known as the EITC.\n\n\u201cI would not say that we\u2019re in a position of supporting that proposal at this point in time,\u201d Austin said. \u201cWe are in the fact-finding stage to better understand it as a public policy and how it impacts the low-income population. We are very supportive of EITC. We think it\u2019s been a very important program for the state of Kansas. We also think it\u2019s very important for us to move forward on Medicaid expansion as well.\u201d\n\nAustin declined to identify the legislators who are crafting the proposal. \u201cHow far will this go?\u201d he asked. \u201cI don\u2019t think anybody knows.\u201d\n\nExpansion would make all Kansans with incomes up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level eligible for Medicaid: For 2015 that\u2019s annual income of $16,105 for an individual and $32,913 for a family of four.\n\nThe federal government will cover all costs of expansion through 2016. After that, states will be responsible for no more than 10 percent of the cost and the federal government will pay the remaining 90 percent.\n\nLawmakers and other state officials who oppose Medicaid expansion \u2014 a group that includes Gov. Sam Brownback \u2014 have cited doubts that the federal government will be able to follow through on its commitment to fully fund expansion in its early years and then fund 90 percent of the costs going forward.\n\nIn recent years, legislators have voted to eliminate tax credits that helped low-income families partially offset the costs of child care, food purchases and rent. Efforts to cut the state\u2019s earned income tax credit stalled in 2012 and 2013 before resurfacing this year.\n\n\u201cWhen it comes to lifting Kansas families and Kansas kids out of poverty, the earned income tax credit is the last tool in the state\u2019s tax-policy tool belt,\u201d said Annie McKay, executive director of the Kansas Center for Economic Growth, a nonpartisan think tank formed as a counter to conservative groups that lobby for lower taxes and smaller government.\n\nIn Kansas, the state\u2019s earned income tax credit is 17 percent of the federal tax credit for low- and modest-income workers.\n\nState records, McKay said, show that 220,000 Kansas households benefited from the state\u2019s earned income tax credit last year. The payments totaled $69.1 million, or an average of $380 per household.\n\nRep. Marvin Kleeb, an Overland Park Republican and chairman of the House Committee on Taxation, said he also had heard discussion of swapping Medicaid expansion for reducing or eliminating the earned income tax credit.\n\n\u201cThe idea has been talked about for the last couple of months,\u201d he said. \u201cWith the EITC, I think there\u2019s always been a discussion about how do we get the most value out of the investment for those it\u2019s trying to help.\u201d\n\nThose discussions, he said, have not involved the tax committee. \u201cIt\u2019s an idea that is running around in the hallways,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not part of the tax solution.\u201d\n\nSen. Les Donovan, a Wichita Republican and chairman of the Senate Committee on Assessment and Taxation, said he\u2019d not heard about the trade but was aware that many senators consider the earned income tax credit overly generous.\n\nEarlier this year, Donovan said, his committee considered but did not adopt a bill that would have reduced the 17 percent earned income tax credit to 8 percent.\n\n\u201cI knew it wouldn\u2019t go that low,\u201d he said. \u201cBut 10 or 12 percent? Maybe.\u201d\n\nThe committee\u2019s deliberations, he said, were complicated by a warning from Shawn Sullivan, the state\u2019s budget director, that cutting the tax credit could jeopardize the state\u2019s federally funded Temporary Assistance for Needy Families block grant \u2014 about $102 million a year \u2014 because the tax credits are considered part of the grant\u2019s required \u201cmaintenance of effort.\u201d\n\nDemocrats are expected to oppose pitting the tax credit against Medicaid expansion.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just a bad idea,\u201d said Rep. Tom Sawyer, a Wichita Democrat and ranking minority member on the tax committee. \u201cThe earned income tax credit is very important for working families. It\u2019s something that even Ronald Reagan supported. It encourages people to work. It makes sure that getting a job is worthwhile, that payroll taxes don\u2019t completely eat it up.\u201d\n\nSawyer said he found it interesting that the rumored trade assumes that Medicaid shouldn\u2019t be expanded without low-income families giving up something in return.\n\n\u201cIf this were a tax break for business, they (conservatives) wouldn\u2019t think twice about it,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if you\u2019re struggling paycheck to paycheck? \u2018No, you can\u2019t have both.\u2019\u201d\n\nDave Ranney is a reporter for KHI News Service in Topeka, a partner in the Heartland Health Monitor team.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Health", "description": "Some legislators are considering the possibility of eliminating the state\u2019s earned income tax credit in exchange for expanding its Medicaid program. \u201cThat", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://kcur.org/post/kansas-lawmakers-talk-about-medicaid-expansion-there-s-catch", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/kcur/files/styles/medium/public/201505/Kleeb.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Some legislators are considering the possibility of eliminating the state\u2019s earned income tax credit in exchange for expanding its Medicaid program. \u201cThat", "title": "Kansas Lawmakers Talk About Medicaid Expansion But There\u2019s A Catch"}, "story_id": 407972138, "twitter": {"site": "@kcur", "card": "summary", "creator": "@kcur"}, "author": "Dave Ranney", "org_id": 0, "dc": {"title": "Kansas Lawmakers Talk About Medicaid Expansion But There\u2019s A Catch"}, "nid": 73442, "datePublished": "2015-05-19", "keywords": "Medicaid, digital post, Heartland Health Monitor", "wordCount": 1265, "has_audio": 0, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2154\"", "article_summary": "In Kansas, the state\u2019s earned income tax credit is 17 percent of the federal tax credit for low- and modest-income workers.\nConversely, most moderates and liberals favor Medicaid expansion and support the earned income tax credit.\nLawmakers and other state officials who oppose Medicaid expansion \u2014 a group that includes Gov.\nState records, McKay said, show that 220,000 Kansas households benefited from the state\u2019s earned income tax credit last year.\nSome legislators are considering the possibility of eliminating the state\u2019s earned income tax credit in exchange for expanding its Medicaid program."}
