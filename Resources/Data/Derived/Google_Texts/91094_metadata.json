Cities with the biggest gains included New York, Los Angeles, and Oakland.\n\nRelated: The Coming Price Increase That Can Break Your Budget\n\nWhile the report doesn\u2019t break down ridership by demographics, population growth coupled with more young people moving to cities certainly contributed to the annual increase, according to Art Guzzetti, vice president for policy at APTA. He said many among the 78 million millennials are thrifty and share this ethos: \u201cI\u2019ll drive a car if that\u2019s the best deal, but I\u2019ll take public transportation if that\u2019s the best deal.\u201d\n\nHe added that public transportation is no longer viewed as a social safety net. Transit rides since 1995 have outpaced population growth, which is up 20.3 percent, according to the study. Ridership rose by 37.2 percent during that same period.\n\n\u201cAnother reason behind the ridership increases is the economic recovery in certain areas,\u201d APTA President Michael Melaniphy said in a statement. \u201cWhen more people are employed, public transportation ridership increases since nearly 60 percent of the trips taken on public transportation are for work commutes.\u201d\n\nSlideshow: The Surprising Reason College Grads Can\u2019t Get a Job\n\nAt the same time, America\u2019s love affair with the automobile isn\u2019t quite yet in decline, according to the study. Vehicle miles traveled increased 0.3 percent last year and are up 22.7 percent since 1995.\n\nLast year\u2019s small increase is supported by a separate report from U.S. Public Interest Research Group and Frontier Group that says the nation\u2019s 60-year driving boom has come to an end, primarily because millennials are shifting away from life with a car and baby boomers are ageing out of their \u201cpeak driving\u201d years.\n\nBesides trolley use, bus ridership was the only means of public transportation to show a decline last year. Ridership in cities with less than 100,000 residents increased 3.8 percent last year. At the same time, bus use in cities with more than half a million residents declined, dragging down overall bus ridership nationwide.\n\nThe figures also looked at public transportation in Canada, where transit rides declined last year.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Americans took more rides on public transportation systems last year \u2013 the most since 1956 \u2013 and experts say that millennials played a big role in that increase as more young people move to cities.", "title": "Millennials Choose Public Transit Over Private Cars", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/03/12/Millennials-Choose-Public-Transit-Over-Private-Cars", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/07172013_High_Speed_Train_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/03/12/Millennials-Choose-Public-Transit-Over-Private-Cars", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/07172013_High_Speed_Train_article.jpg", "creator": "@timothyrhoman", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Americans took more rides on public transportation systems last year \u2013 the most since 1956 \u2013 and experts say that millennials played a big role in that increase as more young people move to cities.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf386\"", "article_summary": "He said many among the 78 million millennials are thrifty and share this ethos: \u201cI\u2019ll drive a car if that\u2019s the best deal, but I\u2019ll take public transportation if that\u2019s the best deal.\u201dHe added that public transportation is no longer viewed as a social safety net.\nThe figures also looked at public transportation in Canada, where transit rides declined last year.\nYounger Americans in 2013 helped boost public transit ridership to a 57-year high with more trips on subways and commuter trains, even as bus rides decreased.\nTransit rides since 1995 have outpaced population growth, which is up 20.3 percent, according to the study.\nBesides trolley use, bus ridership was the only means of public transportation to show a decline last year."}
