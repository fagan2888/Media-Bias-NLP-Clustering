Her characters, like me and so many of my friends, wandered that liminal terrain between late adolescence and early adulthood; a landscape that can feel lonesome and arid, yet simultaneously waterlogged with choices: the kind of choices that we\u2019re told, by friends, parents, ex-lovers, are essential and transformative\u2014what we\u2019ll do for a living (a \u201crespectable,\u201d boast-worthy living, that is) and who we\u2019ll become\u2014but still feel as tedious as choosing between whole-grain and multi-grain bread.\n\nMore from DAME: \u201cStarbucks Got Served a Tempest in a Teacup\u201d\n\nI would read passages from those stories aloud to my friends, and we would marvel at how she had translated the tattoos of our pulses onto the page. In \u201cTrying to Be,\u201d a woman who has moved to New York City to impress a status-obsessed ex searches for something approaching authenticity in a scene full of fashionable schemers: \u201cStephanie wandered from conversation to conversation, having an almost panicky feeling that although there were nice, interesting people in the room, the situation, for all its seeming friendliness and ease, precluded her from connecting with the nice and interesting parts of them. She tried to figure out why this was and could not, beyond the sense that the conversations around her were opening and closing according to subtle but definite rules that no one had told her about.\u201d Gaitskill didn\u2019t just articulate a kind of loneliness rooted in a kind of awkwardness that would\u2019ve been rendered as cutesy or endearing in a film (as the cinematic adaptation of her short story \u201cSecretary\u201d proves), but in real life felt awful and irredeemable\u2014she gave it dignity.\n\nHer second short-story collection, and third book, Because They Wanted To, carried me during the listless tilt into my thirties; this collection made poetry of regret, featuring characters who have made their choices and found their places\u2014only to kick and flail inside the cellophane jail cells of day jobs and lousy lays and aging bodies: \u201cHer thin shoulder in its T-shirt was exposed; it looked both winsome and pathetic \u2026 This would be cute, he thought, if they were anywhere between eighteen and twenty-five. But they were both over thirty; they had lines under their eyes, stains under their teeth, faces that more and more showed their essential confused mildness.\u201d Because They Wanted To is a burn and a balm; it is peopled with the broken-hearted and the disheartened, and yet, some of these characters possess a fortitude that, given their circumstances, feels poignant, even inspiring: \u201cIt was still difficult for Margot to sit down to eat by herself. Still, she was determined to do it \u2026 it made her feel like a tenacious animal, burrowing a home in hard, dry soil.\u201d There have been many nights where, as my Facebook feed fills with wedding pictures and I prepare my nightly meals for one, I hold the words \u201clike a tenacious animal\u201d in my head like a talisman.\n\nThere is no writer alive, in my opinion, who can quite match Gaitskill\u2019s prose at its peak: Her sentences are like slow molasses, rich and dense and demanding to be chewed and tongued and savored in a visceral, tactile way. But the prose is not just beautiful, it creates a profound interiority that is, perhaps, the true hallmark of Gaitskill\u2019s best work. This interiority propels what is arguably her greatest book, the book that crystallized my desire to become a writer, because if I could even approach the threshold of everything she\u2019d accomplished in that book\u2014the characters that haunt you, the immaculate language moving the story and establishing the scope\u2014I would still have achieved something great, the National Book Award\u2013nominated Veronica. A young model\u2019s gradual heartbreak and maturation, and her complicated friendship with the titular character, a brass, kitschy middle-aged office worker, becomes an excavation of the female body as a many-chambered cave of pleasure and pain: \u201cThen he jumped on me. I say \u2018jumped\u2019 because he was quick, but he wasn\u2019t rough. He was strong and excessive, like certain sweet tastes\u2014like grocery pie. But he was also precise. It was so good that when it was over, I felt torn open. Being torn open felt like love to me; I thought it must have felt the same to him.\u201d\n\nWhen I\u2019d learned that Gaitskill\u2019s new novel, The Mare, would focus on motherhood, I was intrigued; though I\u2019ve long decided that parenting is not for me, I\u2019ll be turning 34 next year, and, at times, I am unexpectedly curious, even wistful, about the ghost ship that did not carry me. I was excited to see Gaitskill apply her diamond-sharp, diamond-bright powers of observation to a new kind of longing. There is, of course, great peril in weighing the merit of any book against one\u2019s original hopes for it. And perhaps it\u2019s unfair, or even flat-out wrong, to expect any artist\u2014but especially an artist whose work has nourished us\u2014to keep adding the same old eye-of-newt into her cauldron, to keep incanting the same words. And yet, The Mare is so confounding to me: Parts of it spin that familiar spell of intimacy, but, by and large, it lacks the depth and complexity of character and language that breathe fire into the earlier works.\n\nMore from DAME: \u201cCan the Love of a Dog Be as Powerful as an Anti-Depressant?\u201d\n\nThe Mare begins as the twinned narrative of Velveteen \u201cVelvet\u201d Vargas, a young Dominican girl living New York City squalor with her volatile mother and little brother, and Ginger, a thwarted artist and ex-addict now living cozily upstate with her professor husband. Ginger, haunted by the death of her sister and her own chaotic youth, feels an earthquake of maternal urge; she and her husband, Paul, sign up for the Fresh Air Fund (which brings inner city youth upstate for bucolic country summers), to steady the ground and (hopefully) plant something lasting. Though Ginger desperately wants to be a surrogate mother to the lonely, abused girl, Velvet finds her heart in the horses at the barn near Ginger and Paul\u2019s property\u2014specifically in Fugly Girl, the mare with the scarred muzzle, the beast of burden who has also borne the brunt of someone else\u2019s anger. Early chapters, and the early days of Velvet and Ginger, retain that immersive interiority\u2014but as the novel, and the relationship, stretches on in years, it becomes hollower, shallower. Actions that should be motivated by a deep sense of character happen, at times, too randomly, clearly in service to a plot that strains to sustain itself.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Discovering Gaitskill's short stories was a revelation.
