Obviously, I will look carefully at what I think I can do and make that decision sometime next year,\" Clinton told Barbara Walters Wednesday night on the ABC News special \"Barbara Walters Presents: The 10 Most Fascinating People of 2013.\"\"It's such a difficult decision, and it's one that I'm not going to rush into . . . and I don't think we should be looking at the next election,\" she continued. \"I think we should be looking at the work that we have today. Our unemployment rate is too high. We have people getting kicked off food stamps who are in terrible economic straits. Small business is not getting credit.\"I could go on and on, so I think we ought to pay attention to what's happening right now,\" added Clinton, whom Walters has named her \"most fascinating person of 2013.\"As for what her husband, former president Bill Clinton, wants her to do, the former secretary of state said, \"He wants me to do what I think is right.\"Whether or not that means running for president, Clinton does think there should be a woman in the Oval Office.\"It matters. It matters because we have half the population that has given so much to building this country, to making it work, raising children and, of course, I want to see women eventually in the White House.\"While Clinton claims not to have made up her mind yet, her supporters have clearly made up theirs.Ready for Hillary, a super PAC aimed at building support for a potential 2016 run, is pulling out all the stops , increasing the number of fundraisers and informational meetings, reports CNN. In the past several days, the political action committee has organized events promoting a Clinton candidacy across the country, from California to Washington, D.C.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Clinton,2016,fascinating,walters,", "pubdate": "2013-12-19T11:35:46", "og": {"site_name": "Newsmax", "description": "Hillary Clinton says she has not yet decided whether to make another bid for the White House in 2016.", "title": "Hillary Clinton: 'I Haven't Made Up My Mind' on 2016", "url": "http://www.newsmax.com/Newsfront/Clinton-2016-fascinating-walters/2013/12/19/id/542821/", "page_id": 85452072376, "image": "http://www.newsmax.com/CMSPages/GetFile.aspx?guid=6d2a1d15-c168-4500-b5e0-e24afc2afabb&SiteName=Newsmax", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.newsmax.com/Newsfront/Clinton-2016-fascinating-walters/2013/12/19/id/542821/", "description": "Hillary Clinton says she has not yet decided whether to make another bid for the White House in 2016.", "site": "Newsmax", "title": "Hillary Clinton: 'I Haven't Made Up My Mind' on 2016"}, "epoch": 1387452946, "keywords": "Clinton,2016,fascinating,walters,", "fb": {"admins": 100002083767056, "app_id": 323020797885219}, "article": {"section": "Newsfront", "published_time": "2013-12-19T11:35:46"}, "msvalidate.01": "FAF1322EC761685A5DD9344A1C19E82A", "google-site-verification": "Jt2HUKgzJJw9VwIQJv31ETytuvNNm5ypTWN6j0nYvHM", "original-source": "http://www.newsmax.com/Newsfront/Clinton-2016-fascinating-walters/2013/12/19/id/542821/", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "description": "Hillary Clinton says she has not yet decided whether to make another bid for the White House in 2016."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdfde8\"", "article_summary": "\"Whether or not that means running for president, Clinton does think there should be a woman in the Oval Office.\n\"I haven't made up my mind.\nIowa Poll: Parties Deeply Divided on Hillary Clinton for 2016Hillary Clinton says she has not yet decided whether to make another bid for the White House in 2016.\n\"As for what her husband, former president Bill Clinton, wants her to do, the former secretary of state said, \"He wants me to do what I think is right.\n\"I think we should be looking at the work that we have today."}
