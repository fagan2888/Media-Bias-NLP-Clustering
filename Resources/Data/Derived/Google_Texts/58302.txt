United Healthcare says it is facing major financial losses and may have to exit the Affordable Care Act’s Exchange Program. The country’s largest health insurer is scaling back the marketing of their exchange programs, and will evaluate their Obamacare offerings by next year, possibly forcing millions of Americans to find coverage elsewhere.

We have tried 60 times to repeal Obamacare, but United Healthcare actually represents less than 6 percent of the total number of people who have healthcare through the exchange, and over 12 million people are covered through the exchange, and United Healthcare represents about 550 thousand people enrolled in health insurance. What this is really about is a tactic to get a higher stock price and to create rhetoric that points the blame at Obamacare and not the mismanagement on their side. This is about keeping the bonuses for executives and in the end they will keep the exchange because it is the best place for them to sell insurance, and it doesn’t cost them anything. Over time, this is what will be profitable for them. Insurance companies will always make money. For United Healthcare to leave the healthcare exchange is simply a tactic to negotiate with the government.
