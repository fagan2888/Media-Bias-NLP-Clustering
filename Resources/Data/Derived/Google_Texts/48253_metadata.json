Herredia drove more than 20 miles from La Puente to downtown Los Angeles for a pair of glasses, which aren\u2019t covered under Medi-Cal, California\u2019s version of Medicaid. Sometimes, when her primary doctor is unavailable, she\u2019ll go to an emergency department.\n\n\u201cThings are better now, because my doctors are all at County-USC,\u201d Herredia said of Los Angeles County\u2019s general hospital in Boyle Heights. \u201cIf I have an emergency, I can go to Kaiser (Permanente). They take all people on Medi-Cal now.\u201d\n\nOrganizers for Pathway to Health, which was sponsored by Adventist Services & Industries, said they weren\u2019t surprised they were seeing such crowds, including people with health insurance, several years into the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cPeople come in for various reasons,\u201d said Costin Jordache, spokesman for the event. \u201cPeople will come here because they can\u2019t afford the deductibles.\u201d\n\nIn fact, organizers expected to see more people by Friday, the last day of the clinic, which began on Wednesday. Jordache said more than 4,000 volunteers were ready for every kind of care possible, including mental health services, basic surgery and even free tattoo removal. Most came in for dental and vision care, Jordache added. Neither an ID nor insurance was needed for the free care, Jordache said, and no questions were asked among those who sought services. But people did offer up stories about why they were there.\n\nSome on Medi-Cal \u2014 the state\u2019s healthcare program serving the poor \u2013 said they can\u2019t get in to see physicians for specialty care.\n\nAt least 13.3 million, or one-third of Californians, are on Medi-Cal. In the last two years, 4.7 million people signed up for the program, and many of them were newly insured.\n\nThe surge has had an impact on the overall health are system across California.\n\nRecent figures from the state\u2019s Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development show 1.4 million people who were enrolled into Medi-Cal visited emergency departments across California in 2015, nearly double the number from 2011. But the data can be interpreted in two ways, said Anthony Wright, executive director for Health Access, a California-based consumer advocacy coalition.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not a reflection of people going to the ER more, but that people going are covered,\u201d Wright said.\n\nWright pointed out that the number of uninsured who went to the emergency department decreased by 70 percent in four years, from a little more than 400,000 in 2011 to 236,000 in 2015.\n\n\u201cThe data shows the success of the Affordable Care Act, because you see the number of people who are uninsured has gone down, and that\u2019s good important progress,\u201d Wright said. \u201cThe fact that people who do go to the ER who are covered, who are more likely to have a payment source, is good for the hospital.\u201d\n\nBut Wright also said mega clinics such as Pathway to Health still are needed to fill the gaps in care and also to identify to policymakers where additional reforms need to go.\n\n\u201cI do think there is a concern when you have ER visits based on people who can\u2019t see a doctor or specialists then they wind up at these free clinics,\u201d Wright said. \u201cWe need to get to the point where these clinics are not needed because people are in regular systems of care. We obviously have more work to do.\u201d\n\nSome Providence Health & Services hospitals are seeing more Medi-Cal patients who still have no primary care physicians, said Kevin Traber, the administrative director of emergency at Providence Saint Joseph Medical Center in Burbank. That hospital saw a 9 percent increase in emergency room care last year compared with the same time this year.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re looking to build a new ER to accommodate that future volume,\u201d Traber said.\n\nIn San Pedro, Providence Little Company of Mary Medical Center also is expanding its emergency department. Hospitals also are partnering with Exer\u2013More than Urgent Care, to expand access to affordable emergency care while reducing hospital wait times, he said.\n\nMeanwhile, many patients who made it to the last day of Pathway to Health said they were grateful for the care they received.\n\nAntonio Sixto, 63, said he is uninsured and undocumented and has never visited a doctor, but the lumps on his back were troubling. It turned out the benign bumps were knots of fat that were easily removed by Dr. Janice Schilling and her assistant, registered nurse Jack Wisdom.\n\n\u201cBless you for doing this,\u201d he told them as he sat up after the operation. \u201cI can only imagine how much something like that would have cost.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "For the nearly 6,000 people who turned out for the first two days of the Pathway to Health mega clinic in Los Angeles this week, the free eyeglasses, tooth extractions, echocardiograms, and even", "title": "Thousands \u2014 even with insurance \u2014 flock to free downtown medical clinic", "og": {"url": "http://www.dailynews.com/health/20160429/thousands-x2014-even-with-insurance-x2014-flock-to-free-downtown-medical-clinic", "image": {"width": "1500px", "identifier": "http://www.dailynews.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/LA/20160429/NEWS/160429337/AR/0/AR-160429337.jpg?Maxh=1500&Maxw=1500", "height": "846px"}, "type": "article", "title": "Thousands \u2014 even with insurance \u2014 flock to free downtown medical clinic"}, "twitter": {"domain": "dailynews.com", "description": "For the nearly 6,000 people who turned out for the first two days of the Pathway to Health mega clinic in Los Angeles this week, the free eyeglasses, tooth extractions, echocardiograms, and even", "title": "Thousands \u2014 even with insurance \u2014 flock to free downtown medical clinic", "url": "http://www.dailynews.com/health/20160429/thousands-x2014-even-with-insurance-x2014-flock-to-free-downtown-medical-clinic", "image": {"src": "http://www.dailynews.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/LA/20160429/NEWS/160429337/AR/0/AR-160429337.jpg?Maxh=900&Maxw=900"}, "site": "@ladailynews", "app": {"id": {"ipad": "id551745144", "iphone": "id502957174", "googleplay": "com.spreedinc.providers.digitalfirstmedia.ladailynews"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "keywords": "Los Angeles Convention Center,Medi-Cal,Mega clinic,Providence Health and Services, Access to health care", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Los Angeles Convention Center,Medi-Cal,Mega clinic,Providence Health and Services, Access to health care"}, "article_summary": "Neither an ID nor insurance was needed for the free care, Jordache said, and no questions were asked among those who sought services.\nHospitals also are partnering with Exer\u2013More than Urgent Care, to expand access to affordable emergency care while reducing hospital wait times, he said.\nJordache said more than 4,000 volunteers were ready for every kind of care possible, including mental health services, basic surgery and even free tattoo removal.\nBut among those who stood in the long lines for free care at the Los Angeles Convention Center on Friday, was 54-year-old Carolina Herredia, who has Medi-Cal but still finds herself struggling for basic treatment.\nThat hospital saw a 9 percent increase in emergency room care last year compared with the same time this year."}
