And that's good news.\"\n\nStefanik also pledged to seek a \"flatter, fairer, and simpler\" tax code if she's elected, and she vowed to pursue a national energy policy that creates jobs, lowers costs and protects the environment.\n\n\"We have to address energy costs, which make or break our farms, small businesses, and family budgets,\" she said. \"This means expanding energy exploration, utilizing alternative energy sources like solar and wind, developing more nuclear energy and reining in mandates on energy suppliers and developers ... I believe in an all-of-the-above energy policy that promotes energy independence.\"\n\nA vote for Republicans in November, Stefanik said, is a vote to dispel the \"status quo of more government, more spending, and higher taxes\" and chart a \"new direction of new ideas to unleash job creation and economic growth.\"\n\nThe president, of course, would dispute the idea that job growth has been sluggish. In his own address Saturday, he pointed to Friday's labor report, which showed the economy adding 248,000 jobs in September and the unemployment rate dropping to a six-year-low of 5.9 percent.\n\n\"Over the past 55 months, our businesses have added 10.3 million new jobs,\" he said. \"That's the longest uninterrupted stretch of private sector job creation in our history. And we're on pace to make 2014 the strongest year of job growth since the 1990s.\"\n\nStill, the president acknowledged, Americans' wages haven't kept pace with a growing economy. He proposed raising the minimum wage -- a populist cause he's repeatedly championed as midterm elections approach.\n\n\"It would put more money in workers' pockets. It would help 28 million Americans. Recent surveys show that a majority of small business owners support a gradual increase to 10 dollars and 10 cents an hour,\" he said. \"The folks who keep blocking a minimum wage increase are running out of excuses. Let's give America a raise.\"", "article_metadata": {"description": "The president, though, says evidence shows the health care law is working and Republicans will realize that eventually", "og": {"url": "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/as-midterm-elections-loom-gop-continues-pushing-obamacare-repeal/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/10/04/dc8565fa-1721-42a6-9882-5cd60b66b9d4/thumbnail/1200x630/746c785bb9036c5c32fcc7b317ed49e3/ushealth.jpg", "height": 630}, "type": "article", "description": "The president, though, says evidence shows the health care law is working and Republicans will realize that eventually", "title": "As midterm elections loom, GOP continues pushing Obamacare repeal"}, "twitter": {"description": "The president, though, says evidence shows the health care law is working and Republicans will realize that eventually", "title": "As midterm elections loom, GOP continues pushing Obamacare repeal", "app": {"url": {"ipad": "cbsnewsapp://news/as-midterm-elections-loom-gop-continues-pushing-obamacare-repeal/", "iphone": "cbsnewsapp://news/as-midterm-elections-loom-gop-continues-pushing-obamacare-repeal/", "googleplay": "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/as-midterm-elections-loom-gop-continues-pushing-obamacare-repeal/"}, "country": "US", "name": {"ipad": "CBS News", "iphone": "CBS News", "googleplay": "CBS News"}, "id": {"ipad": 334256223, "iphone": 334256223, "googleplay": "com.treemolabs.apps.cbsnews"}}, "site": "@CBSPolitics", "image": "http://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/10/04/dc8565fa-1721-42a6-9882-5cd60b66b9d4/thumbnail/1200x630/746c785bb9036c5c32fcc7b317ed49e3/ushealth.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "al": {"web": {"url": "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/as-midterm-elections-loom-gop-continues-pushing-obamacare-repeal/"}, "android": {"app_name": "CBS News", "package": "com.treemolabs.apps.cbsnews"}, "ios": {"url": "cbsnewsapp://news/as-midterm-elections-loom-gop-continues-pushing-obamacare-repeal/", "app_name": "CBS News", "app_store_id": 334256223}}, "robots": "index, follow", "fb": {"app_id": 1536620209892267}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/CBSPolitics"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd92a2\"", "article_summary": "\"Our new plan carried a 30 percent premium increase, higher deductibles and higher out-of-pocket co-pays,\" she said.\nMr. Obama cited a drop in health care inflation to argue that the law is doing its part to rein in costs.\nI believe in an all-of-the-above energy policy that promotes energy independence.\"\n\"That's like an $1,800 tax cut for every family that's got health insurance.\nShe proposed repealing Obamacare and replacing it with \"common-sense proposals that lower costs, improve health care quality and increase accessibility, especially for rural communities like New York's North Country.\""}
