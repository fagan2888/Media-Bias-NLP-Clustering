Obama has vowed to veto any of the dozen annual spending bills that reach his desk until the dispute is resolved.\n\nRelated: What Balanced Budget? GOP Pushes a 'Spend More' Blueprint\n\nAlthough the two sides have appeared intransigent in the dispute until now, a top Senate GOP leader disclosed on Tuesday that Republican and Democratic leaders are headed for major budget negotiations in September.\n\nSenate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-TX) said in an interview today that a new round of budget talks are inevitable and will likely begin shortly after Congress returns from its August recess, barely a month before the deadline for enacting fiscal 2016 spending measures. The talks will also come as the Treasury begins to exhaust its borrowing authority and risks bumping up against the debt ceiling.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going to do that until later in September,\u201d Cornyn said following a Senate Republican policy luncheon. \u201cPart of the rationale is they [the Democrats] want to disrupt our ability to actually get anything done now. We\u2019d like to complete what we can now on a bipartisan basis, and then deal with that [budget] issue \u2013 which we invariably will \u2013 but do that later, after the August recess.\u201d\n\nCongress is rushing to resolve a number of thorny issues, including approving a new multi-year highway and transportation funding bill, before the August recess.\n\nCornyn\u2019s comment was among the first indication that Congress and the White House may be headed for a comprehensive budget agreement similar to the one negotiated in late 2013 by then-Senate Budget Committee Chair Patty Murray (D-WA) and then-House Budget Committee Chair Paul Ryan (R-WI).\n\nRelated: Pentagon\u2019s $90 Billion \u2018Slush Fund\u2019 Comes Under Attack\n\nThat deal temporarily lifted the spending caps on domestic and defense spending that were imposed by the 2011 Budget Control Act, and overall spending was boosted by $45 billion.\n\nThe GOP-controlled House and Senate earlier this year approved a Republican crafted budget blue print for the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1 that boosted defense spending by $38 billion above the caps but preserved tight spending limitations for domestic programs important to President Obama and the Democrats.\n\nObama called Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) last week to confer on legislation, according to McConnell\u2019s chief spokesperson, but it wasn\u2019t clear whether the president pushed for renewed negotiations on the budget. McConnell took charge of the Senate in January vowing to prevent a budget crisis that could lead to another government shutdown.\n\nRelated: Out of the Ashes of Budget Politics \u2013 A Compromise?\n\nWith just 18 legislative days remaining before the end of the fiscal year, Democratic Reps. Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, Nita Lowey of New York and others held a news conference today at the Capitol calling for immediate negotiations on a new budget agreement \u201cthat removes the threat of a government shutdown and allows for responsible investments in health care, education, infrastructure, law enforcement, and other critical priorities.\u201d Van Hollen is the ranking Democrat on the House Budget Committee.\n\nSenate Democratic Whip Richard Durbin (D-IL) said in an interview he was unaware of whether the White House and GOP leaders were discussing conducting another mini-budget summit in September, but that \u201cthe sooner they do the better.\u201d\n\n\u201cWaiting until the middle of September \u2013 and that\u2019s what we\u2019re waiting for \u2013 is a guaranteed continuing resolution,\u201d he said, referring to emergency short-term spending authority that continues programs at last year\u2019s levels. \u201cFor how long, I don\u2019t know. So the sooner the conversation begins the better.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "With Republicans and the White House deadlocked once again over budget policy for the", "title": "Cornyn Says Budget Deal Inevitable to Avert a Government Shutdown", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/07/21/Cornyn-Says-Budget-Deal-Inevitable-Avert-Government-Shutdown", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/03052014_Cornyn.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/07/21/Cornyn-Says-Budget-Deal-Inevitable-Avert-Government-Shutdown", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/03052014_Cornyn.jpg", "creator": "@ericpianin", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "With Republicans and the White House deadlocked once again over budget policy for the", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2639\"", "article_summary": "\u201cWe\u2019re not going to do that until later in September,\u201d Cornyn said following a Senate Republican policy luncheon.\nMcConnell took charge of the Senate in January vowing to prevent a budget crisis that could lead to another government shutdown.\nWith Republicans and the White House deadlocked once again over budget policy for the coming year, the prospects are good for another emergency temporary spending bill this fall or \u2013 worse \u2013 another partial government shutdown.\nRelated: Pentagon\u2019s $90 Billion \u2018Slush Fund\u2019 Comes Under AttackThat deal temporarily lifted the spending caps on domestic and defense spending that were imposed by the 2011 Budget Control Act, and overall spending was boosted by $45 billion.\nObama has vowed to veto any of the dozen annual spending bills that reach his desk until the dispute is resolved."}
