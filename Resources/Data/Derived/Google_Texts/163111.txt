Senator Christopher Murphy (D-CT) was attempting to summarize the GOP's position on King v. Burwell, a Supreme Court case relating to the Affordable Care Act, when he turned to the internet's best-known symbol of laissez-faire acceptance: the shruggie. "The Republicans' plan if King v. Burwell goes in favor of the plaintiffs is essentially a shrug of the shoulders," Murphy said on the Senate floor, in front of the shruggie.
