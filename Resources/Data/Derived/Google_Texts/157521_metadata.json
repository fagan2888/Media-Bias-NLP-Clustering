There are still 112 detainees at Guantanamo, of whom 53 have been deemed eligible for transfer.\n\nThe prison has cost the American taxpayers nearly $5 billion since it opened in 2002, with an average price tag of around $495 million every year for the past five years, according to the American Civil Liberties Union.\n\nObama pledged during his 2008 campaign that he would close the detention facility; he has since repeatedly promised to take action, citing the exorbitant cost of running the prison and its use as a recruiting tool for terrorist organizations around the globe.\n\nHis plan, however, could be reconsidered in light of the latest attack by ISIS in Paris, which killed 129 people and injured 352\u2014a massacre that French President Hollande has called an \u201cact of war.\u201d\n\nRepublican and Democratic majorities in Congress have passed multiple laws to check the president\u2019s ability to close the site. The latest came earlier this month when Congress overwhelmingly approved the fiscal 2016 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA).\n\nRelated: The Fight Against ISIS Has New Price Tag: $5 Billion and Counting\n\nThe $607 billion policy roadmap for the Pentagon contains several provisions aimed at stopping the administration from shutting down the facility, including a ban on bringing detainees into the United States.\n\nObama is expected to sign the bill later this month, making a unilateral attempt to shutter the prison his last resort before his term expires. Such a move would set the stage for an enormous test of his presidential power, which took a blow last week when a federal appeals court blocked Obama\u2019s executive order to stop the deportation of millions of undocumented immigrants.\n\nCapitol Hill Democrats have expressed modest support for an executive order on Guantanamo, waiting to see the administration\u2019s plan before they fall in line behind their party\u2019s leader. Republicans in both chambers have already begun to dig in their heels, signaling they would challenge the administration on a variety of fronts.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) demurred on what action the Senate might take against the president, telling reporters last week, \u201cWe\u2019ll see what he does.\u201d Senate Armed Services Committee chair John McCain (R-AZ), a proponent of closing Guantanamo, has threatened a court battle if Obama tries to circumvent Congress.\n\nRelated: Why Hillary Clinton Should Keep Her Distance from Obama\u2019s Policies\n\nMeanwhile, the Pentagon has dispatched a small team in three states to survey existing military detention sites as possible alternatives to Guantanamo. GOP senators from Colorado, Kansas and South Carolina have vowed to use every legislative tool available to them to blunt the White House. They believe that moving terrorists into the U.S. amounts to putting a big, red bulls-eye on the facilities and the surrounding communities for other extremists to target.\n\nSen. Pat Roberts (R-KS) has placed a hold on Obama\u2019s nominee to be the next Army secretary, a hint of how lawmakers could potentially jam up the administration. Newly elected House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI) has also spoken out against a possible go-it-alone approach.\n\n\u201cHe can\u2019t. He [Obama] doesn\u2019t have the authority to do it,\u201d he said in an interview on Bloomberg TV\u2019s With All Due Respect before the last GOP presidential debate.\n\nThe \u201clanguage is very clear that he can\u2019t transfer the prisoners,\u201d Ryan added, noting the 2016 NDAA text was similar to the kind Democrats put in the bill when they ran Congress.\n\n\u201cThe law is the law; it\u2019s just that clear,\u201d he said.\n\nRelated: With ISIS Making Millions, U.S. Boosts Its Attacks on Oil Fields\n\nBetween Obama\u2019s desire to burnish his legacy and the GOP\u2019s strategy to make sure Obama doesn\u2019t do \u201cmore damage\u201d while still in office ahead of the 2016 presidential election, a major Constitutional showdown is brewing.\n\nIn a recent Washington Post op-ed, former White Counsel Gregory and former State Department Guantanamo envoy Cliff Sloan, argued the president should ignore the restrictions imposed by Congress.\n\nThe president \u201cin his capacity as commander in chief, has the exclusive authority to make tactical military decisions. Congress can declare war but cannot direct the conduct of military campaigns,\u201d they wrote. \u201cIt can pass generally applicable military regulations but cannot direct the military\u2019s response to contingent developments.\u201d\n\nLast week, Benjamin Wittes, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, wrote that the view such restrictions are unconstitutional \u201cwould be a bold assertion of executive authority.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe president would be suddenly defying laws he has consistently observed. And he would be doing so only at the point he had lost the ability to get them changed,\u201d he wrote.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "With only 14 months left in office, President Obama is set to issue an executive order", "title": "Obama Readies Biggest Reach of Presidential Power Yet", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/11/15/Obama-Readies-Biggest-Reach-Presidential-Power-Yet", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/guantanamo_2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/11/15/Obama-Readies-Biggest-Reach-Presidential-Power-Yet", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/guantanamo_2.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "With only 14 months left in office, President Obama is set to issue an executive order", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Such a move would set the stage for an enormous test of his presidential power, which took a blow last week when a federal appeals court blocked Obama\u2019s executive order to stop the deportation of millions of undocumented immigrants.\nHe [Obama] doesn\u2019t have the authority to do it,\u201d he said in an interview on Bloomberg TV\u2019s With All Due Respect before the last GOP presidential debate.\nAnd he would be doing so only at the point he had lost the ability to get them changed,\u201d he wrote.\nCongress can declare war but cannot direct the conduct of military campaigns,\u201d they wrote.\nObama is expected to sign the bill later this month, making a unilateral attempt to shutter the prison his last resort before his term expires."}
