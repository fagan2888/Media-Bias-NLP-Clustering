Wichita Police Department will have increased patrols this holiday season, especially in the evenings.

"Police department has taken steps to increase DUI enforcement. Officers are out and will be arresting those who are under the influence of alcohol or drugs, " Wichita Police Department Sgt. Kelly O'Brien said.

Increased enforcement is nothing new. However, this year, they police department along with the Kansas DUI Impact Center have created something to remember the lives impacted drunk drivers.

"These magnets are placed on each police vehicle. Each magnet has the name of someone in the community that has either died as a result of a drunk driver or has been seriously injured," Sgt. O'Brien said.

These names, the reason why officers want to step up their DUI patrols.

"One officer pointed out he was on that collision and he was there and wanted that name. Another one was the name of a former officer and he wanted to be able to put that on his vehicle," he said.

Wichita Police Department is able to put more officers out on the streets because of a grant program sponsored by the Kansas Department of Transportation.
