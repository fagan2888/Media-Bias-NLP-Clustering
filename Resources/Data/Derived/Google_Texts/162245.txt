A Section 105 Plan allows tax-free reimbursement of medical and insurance expenses. The Section 105 Plan Document describes the terms and conditions related to the operation and administration of the Section 105 Plan.

What is a Section 105 Plan?

The most common type of Section 105 plan is a self-funded (or self-insured) health plan, where the employer self-funds (or self-insures) health benefits rather than pay premiums to an insurance company.

However, Section 105 Plans are also frequently found in the form of medical reimbursement plans such as Health Reimbursement Arrangements (HRAs) and Healthcare Reimbursement Plans (HRPs).

A businesses might also implement a Section 105 Plan alongside a conventional employer-sponsored health insurance plan (to reimburse deductible amounts).

When discussing Section 105 Plan Document requirements in this article, we are focusing on Section 105 Plans used as a limited-purpose medical reimbursement plan (i.e. a Healthcare Reimbursement Plan or HRP).
