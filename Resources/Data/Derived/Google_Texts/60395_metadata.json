And we wake up every morning thinking how we can punch each other in the nose.\u201d\n\nThe news has been dominated by President Obama\u2019s inept handling of the Syria issue. Obama\u2019s performance has united Republicans, or at least the large majority of them, against intervention in Syria\u2019s civil war. But that\u2019s just about the only unity in the GOP now.\n\nWith a deadline \u2014 and a possible government shutdown \u2014 now 18 days away, House Republicans still can\u2019t agree among themselves on a plan to fund the federal government. Does it have to include a measure to defund Obamacare? Should that be a separate proposal? What about sequestration? Should Republicans trade away some of their hard-won spending cuts for a delay of Obamacare implementation? For entitlement reform? For something else? And what about the debt ceiling?\n\nIt\u2019s hard to overstate the extent of Republican divisions on all of those questions. Read theWashington Examiner\u2018s Susan Ferrechio. And David Drucker. And Conn Carroll. There\u2019s simply nothing approaching a Republican majority on some very key questions.\n\nWhen Republicans discuss Obama\u2019s meandering course on Syria, they stress that it\u2019s difficult for Americans to have faith in his leadership. But when a House Republican says, \u201cThere\u2019s no faith in leadership,\u201d he\u2019s not talking about Obama. He\u2019s talking about the confusing and difficult state of affairs inside the House GOP.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Human Events", "description": "Obama\u2019s performance has united Republicans.
