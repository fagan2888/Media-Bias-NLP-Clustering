Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, chairwoman of the Senate Special Committee on Aging, urged state securities regulators Monday to rally behind her Senior$afe Act of 2015, which aims to help financial professionals report elder financial fraud.

Collins introduced the legislation, which is modeled on a Senior Safe program in her state, last October along with Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo. She told state securities regulators at the North American Securities Administrators Association’s annual policy conference in Washington that she and McCaskill need to add more co-sponsors to the bill’s current seven.
