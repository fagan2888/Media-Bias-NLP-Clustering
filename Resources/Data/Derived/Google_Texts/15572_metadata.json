Still, unless the world soon devolves into a nightmarish hell of famine, death, pestilence and war, I think it\u2019s fair to presume that future generations will not remember President Barack Obama\u2019s tenure as a second era of good feelings. The country\u2019s political system has been through worse, of course. That whole Civil War thing, for example, was not great.\n\nIf I had to guess which moment future Americans will regard as the low point of our recent past, I\u2019d imagine the time we came thisclose to causing yet another global financial panic will be a strong contender. But as bad as that was, it\u2019s not the episode I\u2019ll remember most bitterly. No, when I think back on this weird, disordered time, the memory most likely to make me wince won\u2019t have to do with austerity or health care or Wall Street reform. It will be, instead, the controversy surrounding Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl, who was charged by the U.S. Army with desertion and misbehavior before the enemy earlier this week.\n\nFor those who don\u2019t remember, Bergdahl is the young man who spent five years in Afghanistan being tortured as a prisoner of the Taliban, and who became a figure of enormous controversy after the White House decided to \u201cswap\u201d him for five Taliban militants held at Guantanamo Bay. At the time of the deal, Bergdahl was thought by most Americans \u2014 especially conservatives eager to attack Obama \u2014 to be a prisoner of war. Taking a step toward closing Guantanamo once and for all, while simultaneously bringing an American boy home, seemed, at first, like a moral and political no-brainer.\n\nIt was not to be. Soon after reports that the Bergdahl transaction was real went public, murmurings started popping up in the press intimating that the POW wasn\u2019t a victim. It turned out that rather than being captured while fighting heroically for democracy and freedom, Bergdahl fell into the Taliban\u2019s hands while wandering, without permission, from his base. The reasons why he did so were unclear, but a narrative soon formed on the far-right \u2014 courtesy of Richard Grenell, a Fox News yakker and former advisor to neoconservative \u201cdeath walrus\u201d John Bolton \u2014 that Bergdahl was a coward who\u2019d grown disillusioned with the U.S. mission in Afghanistan and wanted to join the other side.\n\nOnce they had decided that Bergdahl was a traitor, one that other soldiers had died trying to save, conservatives were overcome by a spasm of bloodthirsty nationalism and belligerent tribalism like few I\u2019ve ever seen. Sarah Palin, who\u2019d only months before slammed Obama for leaving Bergdahl behind, railed that the swap gave \u201cOsama Bin Laden\u2019s partners in evil crime\u201d cause to \u201cjoyfully celebrate.\u201d Fox News published an inexcusably shoddy report alleging Bergdahl had converted to Islam in hopes of becoming a jihadist. Rush Limbaugh argued that his release was an \u201cexcuse\u201d for President Obama to do what he always wanted and let terrorists \u201crun free.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "This week's news of the former POW's charges inspired a future history lesson on the far right's violent tendencies", "title": "The right\u2019s hot Bergdahl rage: Why a former prisoner drives conservatives batty", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "This week's news of the former POW's charges inspired a future history lesson on the far right's violent tendencies", "title": "The right\u2019s hot Bergdahl rage: Why a former prisoner drives conservatives batty", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/03/28/the_rights_hot_bergdahl_rage_why_a_former_prisoner_drives_conservatives_batty/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/06/bergdahl_palin.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "This week's news of the former POW's charges inspired a future history lesson on the far right's violent tendencies", "title": "The right\u2019s hot Bergdahl rage: Why a former prisoner drives conservatives batty", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/06/bergdahl_palin.jpg", "creator": "@eliasisquith", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Elias Isquith", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, 9/11, Afghanistan, Bill O'Reilly, Bowe Bergdahl, Conservatives, Editor's Picks, Far-right, Fox News, John Bolton, Oliver North, Richard Grenell, Rush Limbaugh, Sarah Palin, Taliban", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca22a\"", "article_summary": "At the time of the deal, Bergdahl was thought by most Americans \u2014 especially conservatives eager to attack Obama \u2014 to be a prisoner of war.\nBowe Bergdahl, who was charged by the U.S. Army with desertion and misbehavior before the enemy earlier this week.\nSoon after reports that the Bergdahl transaction was real went public, murmurings started popping up in the press intimating that the POW wasn\u2019t a victim.\nRush Limbaugh argued that his release was an \u201cexcuse\u201d for President Obama to do what he always wanted and let terrorists \u201crun free.\u201d\nIt turned out that rather than being captured while fighting heroically for democracy and freedom, Bergdahl fell into the Taliban\u2019s hands while wandering, without permission, from his base."}
