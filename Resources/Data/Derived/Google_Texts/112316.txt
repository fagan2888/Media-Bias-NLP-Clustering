Stocks of hospitals and insurance companies like Humana and UnitedHealth Group rose on Thursday following the 6-3 Supreme Court ruling that upheld a central part of President Barack Obama's health care law. Health care stocks also got a second boost later in the day, spurred by reports from Bloomberg that Aetna, the second most valuable U.S. health insurer, could announce an acquisition of Humana Inc. as early as this weekend.

Values of numerous stocks skyrocketed after the announcement of the Supreme Court ruling shortly after 10 a.m. and held their higher value when Wall Street closed. Top winners included HCA Holdings, which rose approximately 9 percent, LifePoint Health, which rose 7.6 percent, Tenet Healthcare, up 12.29 percent, Universal Health Services, which rose 7.73 percent, and Community Health Systems, which rose approximately 13 percent.



Along with the high court ruling that enabled people to keep tax subsidies that help them afford health insurance under the Affordable Care Act, news of a merger between health care giants boosted industry stocks even more. Aetna has made a formal bid for Humana, and a deal would likely value Humana higher than $28 billion, according to reports.

This followed another merger effort earlier this week by insurer Anthem, which offered more than $47 billion for its rival Cigna. Anthem's stock rose 1.41 percent Thursday amid increased speculation about industry mergers, while Humana was up 7.1 percent by the end of the market day.

Cigna has rejected the offer but Anthem Chief Financial Officer Wayne DeVeydt told the Associated Press that it will try again.

Hospitals enjoyed a larger boost from the ruling than insurers because they carry the burden of providing the health care, explains John Blank, chief equity strategist for Zacks Investment Research.
