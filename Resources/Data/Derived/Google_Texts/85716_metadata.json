Together, the three companies make up the entirety of those in Louisiana that sell coverage to residents under the Affordable Care Act, United States President Barack Obama\u2019s hallmark healthcare legislation often called \u201cObamacare.\u201d Humana, a fourth company, will for now accept payments made through the HIV/AIDS assistance program, but only offers coverage through the Obamacare marketplace in the Orleans Perish region of the state.\n\nTed Griggs, a journalist for The Advocate, estimates that close to 2,000 impoverished Louisiana residents living with HIV/AIDS will be impacted by the maneuver.\n\nAhead of the official Obamacare roll-out last October, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) \u2014 the lead government agency involved in the program \u2014 told insurers that Ryan White funds \"may be used to cover the cost of private health insurance premiums, deductibles and co-payments\" for patients enrolled in Obamacare, according to Reuters. By November, however, the CMS was warning \"hospitals, other healthcare providers and other commercial entities\" that it has \"significant concerns\" about what the newswire regarded as \u201csupporting premium payments and helping Obamacare consumers pay deductibles and other costs, citing the risk of fraud.\u201d\n\nSure enough, a spokesperson for Blue Cross Blue Shield cited fraud to Reuters a few weeks ago when explaining the insurer\u2019s decision.\n\n\"As an anti-fraud measure, Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Louisiana has implemented a policy, across our individual health insurance market, of not accepting premium payments from any third parties who are not related\" to the subscriber, Blue Cross Blue Shield of Louisiana spokesman John Maginnis said.\n\nBoth Maginnis\u2019 remark and the warning from CMS come despite a statement on the website for the US Department of Health and Human Service\u2019s Health Resource and Service Administration in which the Affordable Care Act is hailed as \u201can historic opportunity for people living with HIV (PLWH), including those currently receiving services through the Ryan White Program, to increase their access to affordable, quality health care.\u201d\n\nMaginnis told The Advocate that \u201corganizations can still provide the members with financial support toward their premiums, but they must let the members make the premium payments directly for their health insurance policies.\u201d Such a transaction, however, is forbidden under the rules established by the federal Health Resources and Services Administration, which oversees the Ryan White program \u2014 named for an American teenager who died of complications from AIDS in 1990.\n\n\u201cIn no case may Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program funds be used to make direct payments of cash to recipients of services,\u201d The Advocate quoted from the agency\u2019s website in a report published to their website last week.\n\nLambda Legal, a non-profit group that advocates on behalf of HIV patients, filed a federal civil rights complaint against Blue Cross Blue Shield of Louisiana\u2019s decision shortly after it was announced. It has since filed separate complaints against Louisiana Health Cooperative and Vantage Health Plan, Reuters reported, in an effort to force insurers to accept third-party payments made by federal assistance programs.\n\n\"The worst nightmare for people with HIV/AIDS is coming true in Louisiana: they're being turned away in what's become a race to the bottom by insurers,\u201d Susan Sommer, the group\u2019s director of constitutional litigation, said to Reuters.\n\n\"What we're seeing in Louisiana is a crisis for low-income people with AIDS,\" she said. \"These are exactly the people the Affordable Care Act was designed to provide a safety net for.\"\n\nAccording to the advocacy coordinator at Shreveport, LA\u2019s Philadelphia Center, Eric Evans, prescriptions for HIV patients can cost as much as $10,000 a month. He now tells The Advocate that Lambda Legal is considering filing lawsuits against the three insurer carriers if the federal complaints don\u2019t cause the companies to reconsider.\n\nIn the meantime, Louisiana Blue reiterated just last week that it will stop accepting third-party payments for premiums beginning at the start of next month. That new policy, the company told Reuters, is \u201ca safeguard against ... patient steering and other fraudulent activities.\"\n\nAccording to the newswire, the CMS said this week that it \"is considering amending the rules to require,\" and not merely allow, \"issuers to accept these (Ryan White) payments.\"", "article_metadata": {"description": "\u200bLow-income HIV patients in Louisiana are finding themselves left in the dark after all three insurance companies that handle coverage under the Affordable Care Act across the state said they\u2019d start rejecting certain federal assistance.", "og": {"site_name": "RT International", "description": "\u200bLow-income HIV patients in Louisiana are finding themselves left in the dark after all three insurance companies that handle coverage under the Affordable Care Act across the state said they\u2019d start rejecting certain federal assistance.", "title": "Obamacare insurers in Louisiana to cut off thousands from HIV/AIDS assistance", "locale": "en_EN", "image": "https://img.rt.com/files/news/22/92/70/00/obamacare.si.jpg", "url": "https://www.rt.com/usa/health-coverage-aids-louisiana-607/", "type": "article"}, "navigation": "tabbed", "twitter": {"description": "\u200bLow-income HIV patients in Louisiana are finding themselves left in the dark after all three insurance companies that handle coverage under the Affordable Care Act across the state said they\u2019d start rejecting certain federal assistance.", "title": "RT International", "image": "https://img.rt.com/files/news/22/92/70/00/obamacare.si.jpg", "creator": "@RT_com", "site": "@RT_com", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "HandheldFriendly": "true", "format-detection": "telephone=yes", "msvalidate.01": "36879475773792950F4872586A371571", "google-site-verification": "VQLbsaWKiXW2-Vt4lP7MevnhMES537NO4fQjfGgLcbI", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "MobileOptimzied": "width", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd02f0\"", "article_summary": "In addition to Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Louisiana, Louisiana Health Cooperative and Vantage Health Plan \u2014 two smaller insurers \u2014 now say they will reject third-party payments.\nAccording to the newswire, the CMS said this week that it \"is considering amending the rules to require,\" and not merely allow, \"issuers to accept these (Ryan White) payments.\"\nIn the meantime, Louisiana Blue reiterated just last week that it will stop accepting third-party payments for premiums beginning at the start of next month.\nIt has since filed separate complaints against Louisiana Health Cooperative and Vantage Health Plan, Reuters reported, in an effort to force insurers to accept third-party payments made by federal assistance programs.\nLambda Legal, a non-profit group that advocates on behalf of HIV patients, filed a federal civil rights complaint against Blue Cross Blue Shield of Louisiana\u2019s decision shortly after it was announced."}
