The Rockies smell like a slaughterhouse in northern Colorado.\n\nEven though they are not real rivals, these two teams have been virtual conjoined twins, like Chang and Eng, since a National League expansion committee selected Denver and Miami for baseball\u2019s newest franchises 24 years ago this week.\n\nThis is the oddest statistic of the season:\n\nAfter Saturday\u2019s game in LoDo \u2014 delayed by weather, as usual \u2014 the Marlins and the Rockies each have won exactly the same number of regular-season games in 22-plus seasons: 1,666.\n\nBoth have averaged 87 losses a year.\n\nThat\u2019s not very sunny and warm.\n\nNeither has won its division.\n\nThat\u2019s rather dark and stormy.\n\nIn fish head-to-rock head competition, the Floridians possessed a 92-88 record against the Coloradans after splitting the first two games of the series. The Rox lost Friday night, then blew out the Marlins 10-5 on Saturday.\n\nThe Rockies have no advantage at 5,200 feet in 2015. The Marlins have one more home victory this season than the Rox, but they\u2019ve never owned an edge at 9 feet above sea level.\n\nThe Marlins and the Rockies began their existences playing in football stadiums. The Rox did win the first game in 1993. Rox first-base coach Eric Young, then the team\u2019s second baseman, went 2-for-3 and scored a run, and current bullpen coach Darren Holmes, then a relief pitcher, earned his first Rockies save.\n\nExpansion teams are expected to reek.\n\nBut 23 seasons later?\n\nIn the Fish & Gamey Department, the pair combined have finished fourth, fifth or sixth 27 times.\n\nWhere\u2019s the Broncos\u2019 gas-passer tax jar?\n\nWhich club\u2019s history would you take?\n\nThe Rockies do have the lead over the Marlins in trips to the postseason as wild cards, 3-2.\n\nThe Marlins do have the lead over the Rockies in World Series championships, 2-0.\n\nSeafood wins.\n\nWhich team would you take this season?\n\nThe Rockies have a slightly better record, but are last in the National League West. The Marlins are fourth in the National League East. Neither team is planning to win the World Series or make the playoffs. In major-league power rankings by various websites, despite the Rockies\u2019 recent surge, they rank 24-27. The Marlins are listed from 22-28.\n\nThe Rox are above the Marlins in team hitting in baseball (13-21), but behind in pitching (29-19) and defense (17-1). Advantage, Miami.\n\nThe Rockies have fallen under 30,000 a game to 14th in attendance, while the Marlins, who\u2019ve never drawn a crowd, are third-to-last at barely over 20,000 per game.\n\nThe Rockies are considered to have a top-12 farm system, and the Marlins are in the bottom six.\n\nThe past has been dimmer for the Rockies than the Marlins, but the future would seem to lean toward the Rockies.\n\nBut, then, the Marlins have Giancarlo Stanton, one of the greatest power hitters in the game. He hit a nice little 478-foot homer Friday night. The Rockies responded Saturday with Wilin Rosario powering two home runs and Carlos Gonzalez one.\n\nThe Marlins have the thin edge in three starting position players, but they will have the serious difference in starting pitcher when Jose Fernandez (Tommy John surgery) comes off the disabled list July 1.\n\nFernando Alvarez and Matt Latos are down for a while. But veteran Dan Haren, whom the Rockies could have gotten a couple of times, is 6-2 with a 3.18 earned run average for the Marlins. The Rockies did get Kyle Kendrick, who is 2-7 with a 6.55 ERA.\n\nA tie in lifetime victories for the Marlins and the Rockies seems only fitting, given the ownership.\n\nJeffrey Loria is an art dealer. Dick Monfort is a meatpacker. But they profess to know how to run a baseball team.\n\nLoria has controlled the Marlins since 2002. Although the club has won the title twice, Loria is a joke of an owner and has torn the team apart several seasons. He has fired five managers (the latest this season), and two others resigned.\n\nMonfort you know more than enough about.\n\nWhich owner would you want? If you\u2019re in Miami, Monfort would be the man. They don\u2019t know enough.\n\nSo, the Rockies and the Marlins are tied in mediocrity.\n\nWoody Paige: woody@woodypaige.com or twitter.com/woodypaige", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Paige: Ask your nose which franchise is worse: Rockies or Marlins", "title": "Paige: Ask your nose which franchise is worse: Rockies or Marlins", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/06/06/paige-ask-your-nose-which-franchise-is-worse-rockies-or-marlins/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150509__20150510_C1_SP10PAIGEp1.jpg", "height": 419}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150509__20150510_C1_SP10PAIGEp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-06-06T20:38:31+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-05-23T02:40:55+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Woody Paige"}, "article_summary": "The Rox are above the Marlins in team hitting in baseball (13-21), but behind in pitching (29-19) and defense (17-1).\nThe past has been dimmer for the Rockies than the Marlins, but the future would seem to lean toward the Rockies.\nIn fish head-to-rock head competition, the Floridians possessed a 92-88 record against the Coloradans after splitting the first two games of the series.\nA tie in lifetime victories for the Marlins and the Rockies seems only fitting, given the ownership.\nThe Rockies do have the lead over the Marlins in trips to the postseason as wild cards, 3-2."}
