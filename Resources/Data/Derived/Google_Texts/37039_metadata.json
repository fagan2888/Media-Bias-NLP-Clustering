He did not say where he was.\n\nOn Saturday, Di Peri said he had not spoken with his client since he was taken into custody, but that he expected Italy would request extradition and said that Dell'Utri would likely have to hire a Lebanese lawyer to assist him.\n\nA year ago, a Palermo appeals court convicted the 72-year-old Dell'Utri of acting as a go-between for the Sicilian Mafia and the Milan business elite, including Berlusconi's companies, until 1992 and sentenced him to seven years in prison.\n\nDell'Utri, who denies any wrongdoing, appealed to the country's highest court.\n\nIn accordance with Italian law, the Sicilian-born Dell'Utri was free as he awaited the final ruling. If it is upheld, he would have faced immediate arrest.\n\nIn the statement issued on Friday, Dell'Utri said he was confident that the high court would rule in his favor, adding that it was not his intention to hide from the verdict.\n\nDell'Utri and four-time prime minister Berlusconi, 77, have been friends since they attended university together in Milan in the early 1960s. Berlusconi is not a defendant in the trial.\n\nDell'Utri ran the advertising company in Berlusconi's media empire from 1984 to 1995, and became a key adviser when Berlusconi entered politics two decades ago, helping him to establish his own political party from scratch.\n\nBoth Berlusconi and Dell'Utri have been dogged by legal troubles for most of their political careers, and both accuse magistrates of persecuting them for political reasons.\n\n(Additional reporting by Wladimir Pantaleone in Palermo; Editing by Stephen Powell)", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Steve Scherer", "Author": "Steve Scherer", "DCSext.PageNumber": 1, "twitter": {"description": "Beirut police on Saturday picked up a longtime political ally and friend of former Italian prime minister Silvio Berlusconi after he was declared a fugitive earlier this week.", "creator": "@Reuters", "image": "http://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20140412&t=2&i=884030866&w=&fh=545px&fw=&ll=&pl=&sq=&r=CBREA3B0YO500", "title": "Beirut police detain Berlusconi ally ahead of mafia verdict", "site": "@Reuters", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "DCSext.rChannel": "Article -
