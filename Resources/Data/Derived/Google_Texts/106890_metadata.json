Its first quarter of classes begins April 7.\n\nThe Lubbock location is one of a chain of 27 for-profit institutions located mostly in the southern United States. The main campus is based in Birmingham, Ala.\n\n\u201cWhen we go into a community, there has to be a need. There is a great need here,\u201d Karina Long, president of the Lubbock location, said.\n\nThe 55,000-square-foot facility, formerly a shopping center, is open for walk-ins hoping to see the building. Eventually, the school will employ up to 125 local faculty.\n\nThe college will offer associate\u2019s degrees and career certification in areas such as business administration, cosmetology, medical billing and coding and medical assistance. Long said more degree programs could be offered as the school grows.\n\nAccording to Long, the most popular program on the other VC campuses is cosmetology, but medical coding and billing has seen a surge in popularity as insurance companies adapt to the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not here to compete with Texas Tech,\u201d Long said.\n\nUnlike Tech, which targets recent high school graduates, VC\u2019s programs are tailored toward non-traditional students who have already entered the workforce and are looking to change careers.\n\n\u201cWe are an alternative that serves a large group of adult students who are looking for the most direct path to a new career,\u201d reads a statement provided by VC.\n\nThe demographic varies from location to location, but Long said VC students are mostly female.\n\n\u201cThey understand that they need the skills to qualify for a new position,\u201d director of enrollment Dan Salehi said. \u201cUltimately, it\u2019s not about what degree they want, it\u2019s about what career they want.\u201d\n\nSo far, only 10 students have registered for classes since enrollment began two weeks ago, but Salehi said about 140 have inquired about programs the school offers.\n\nSalehi and Long were optimistic that more students would enroll as word spreads. VC has about 16,000 students nationwide.\n\nThe 50th Street building is equipped with its own bookstore, library, several computer labs and a mock examination room.\n\nThe Lubbock location will offer a full-service cosmetology center, open to customers, where students in the program will hone their trade. Long said other programs will feature \u201cexternships,\u201d in which students will work at local businesses.\n\n\u201cWe care about our students, and I seriously mean that,\u201d Long said. \u201cA lot of our students don\u2019t have a good support system at home. We are that support system for them.\u201d\n\nThe school employs financial aid specialists to help students determine a payment plan. Tuition varies according to the academic program, but Long said on average it ranges between $15,000 and $32,000 per program.\n\nBooks and uniform cost are included with tuition, Long said. Financial aid, including the FAFSA program and outside scholarships, are available to students. More options will be made available as the school grows, Long said.\n\nClasses operates on a quarterly calendar, with academic terms lasting for a couple months during each season. The spring term lasts from early April until late June.\n\nAccording to a release from the school, VC is accredited by the Accrediting Council for Independent Colleges and Schools.\n\nblake.ursch@lubbockonline.com\n\n\u2022 766-8722\n\nFollow Blake on Twitter\n\n@BlakeUrsch_AJ", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Education, BLAKE URSCH", "og": {"site_name": "Lubbock Online | Lubbock Avalanche-Journal", "description": "Virginia College, already in a dozen cities nationwide, will be opening in Lubbock in April.", "title": "Virginia College waits to begin classes in Lubbock", "url": "http://lubbockonline.com/education/2014-02-17/virginia-college-waits-begin-classes-lubbock", "image": "http://lubbockonline.com/sites/default/files/13094392.jpg", "type": "article"}, "description": "There\u2019s a new school in town.Virginia College, located at 5005 50th St., is enrolling post-secondary students into its diploma and associate\u2019s degree programs.
