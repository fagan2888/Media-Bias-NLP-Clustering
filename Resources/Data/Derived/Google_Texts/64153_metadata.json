It called their conduct at best \u201creckless and irresponsible\u201d and at worst intentionally misleading.\n\nRelated: Solyndra Collapse Threatens Clean Energy\n\nBut the report also found that the Energy Department and other administration officials had been slipshod in overseeing the contract, missing numerous opportunities to uncover the company\u2019s deceptive actions.\n\nThe latest findings revive the sorry saga of Solyndra, a low point in the early days of the Obama administration. Obama was blasted by Republicans for what they viewed as crony capitalism and political favoritism that cost the public dearly. The scandal also provides a cautionary tale for the president and his successor about the risks of managing large, multibillion-dollar energy initiatives without sweating the details.\n\nObama repeatedly cited the government loan guarantee to Solyndra as the first major step in his initiative to wean the economy off of its dependence on fossil fuels and turn to alternative sources of energy, including solar power and wind. While visiting its plant in May 2010, Obama declared that Solyndra was \u201cleading the way toward a brighter and more prosperous future.\u201d\n\nRelated: Obama Clean Tech Money Goes to Political Cronies\n\nBut the government was left holding the bag after the company laid off 1,100 workers and filed for bankruptcy in September 2011. Republicans launched investigations. And it was subsequently revealed that Office of Management and Budget officials felt pressured to approve the loan, despite concerns about Solyndra\u2019s financial stability.\n\nAccording to the IG\u2019s report, Solyndra\u2019s leaders engaged in a systematic pattern of lying and deception to paint their company\u2019s financial situation in the most positive light while hiding crucial information that might have prevented them from qualifying for the first highly coveted clean-energy loan under a program designed to spend as much as $40 billion.\n\n\u201cOur investigation confirmed that during the loan guarantee application process and while drawing down loan proceeds, Solyndra provided the Department with statements, assertions, and certifications that were inaccurate and misleading, misrepresented known facts, and, in some instances, omitted information that was highly relevant to key decisions in the process to award and execute the $535 million loan guarantee,\u201d the report concluded. \u201cIn our view, the investigative record suggests that the actions of certain Solyndra officials were, at best, reckless and irresponsible or, at worst, an orchestrated effort to knowingly and intentionally deceive and mislead the Department.\u201d\n\nThe company\u2019s efforts to hide the true state of its finances included overstating by 20 percent to 65 percent its competitive advantage over rival companies, misleading an independent engineering firm brought in by the government to assess Solyndra\u2019s share of the solar panel market and deceiving Fitch Ratings service, which was retained to check out the firm\u2019s credit.\n\nRelated: Solyndra Went on a Spending Spree After Getting Loan\n\nThe Justice Department decided earlier this year not to prosecute the former officials of the now-defunct company, according to The Washington Post, which first reported on the Inspector General\u2019s findings.\n\nMiles Ehrlich, a lawyer for founder and former Solyndra CEO Chris Gronet and former Chief Financial Officer Bill Stover told the Post that his clients and other former company executives \u201cwere completely truthful and accurate\u201d in characterizing the company\u2019s financial picture to the Energy Department.\n\nWhile the Inspector General\u2019s report clearly holds Solyndra officials largely responsible for the debacle, it has harsh words for the Energy Department\u2019s performance.\n\nRelated: Will Solyndra Taint Obama\u2019s Clean Energy Record?\n\nHere are just a few examples the report cited to illustrate Energy\u2019s lack of due diligence:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "In concluding a four-year investigation into the controversy surrounding the Obama adm", "title": "Slipshod Energy Department Cited in Final Report on $500 Million Solyndra Scandal", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/08/27/Slipshod-Energy-Department-Cited-Final-Report-500-Million-Solyndra-Scandal", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/03212012_Solar_Panels_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/08/27/Slipshod-Energy-Department-Cited-Final-Report-500-Million-Solyndra-Scandal", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/03212012_Solar_Panels_article.jpg", "creator": "@ericpianin", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "In concluding a four-year investigation into the controversy surrounding the Obama adm", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd3d4\"", "article_summary": "The report released on Thursday said Solyndra officials repeatedly mislead the government and independent experts brought in to examine the books.\nWhile the Inspector General\u2019s report clearly holds Solyndra officials largely responsible for the debacle, it has harsh words for the Energy Department\u2019s performance.\nThe latest findings revive the sorry saga of Solyndra, a low point in the early days of the Obama administration.\nRelated: Solyndra Collapse Threatens Clean EnergyBut the report also found that the Energy Department and other administration officials had been slipshod in overseeing the contract, missing numerous opportunities to uncover the company\u2019s deceptive actions.\nHere are just a few examples the report cited to illustrate Energy\u2019s lack of due diligence:"}
