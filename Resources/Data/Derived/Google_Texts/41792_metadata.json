Gen. H. Michael Edwards, adjunct general for the Colorado National Guard, said during his speech at the Pillar of Fire Christian Church on Sherman Street.\n\nMany in the church were wearing \u201cMy Hero\u201d pins to remember their loved ones. Names of those lost were read aloud, followed by a chime on a polished gold bell.\n\n\u201cIt is nice to get together with other Gold Star Families that we don\u2019t see very often,\u201d said Nancy Pfander, mother of a fallen serviceman.\n\nThe families at the ceremony seemed like old friends, rubbing one another\u2019s backs and hugging after names of the fallen were read.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s nice to support each other,\u201d said Silvia Buonicon, whose son died in the service.\n\nThe two-hour ceremony was filled with speeches and patriotic songs honoring the fallen, living veterans and those on active duty. The crowd, most dressed in red, white and blue, continually wiped tears from their cheeks throughout the tribute.\n\n\u201cYou leave feeling very drained,\u201d Buonicon said.\n\nMany families were honored for the first time during the ceremony. Each received a hand-sewn banner when the name of their loved one and a short paragraph about him or her was read.\n\n\u201cI always feel the worst for those who are here for the first time,\u201d Pfander said.\n\nChristy Goetz Bixby attended the tribute for the second time after her husband was killed in 2010.\n\n\u201cSitting with the Gold Star Families makes it feel like we are all one family,\u201d Bixby said. \u201cIt means a lot to me because they are never forgotten.\u201d\n\nThe solemn event followed a parade around Civic Center park \u2014 but that event created a certain amount of confusion.\n\nThe parade began in front of the City and County Building at 10 a.m. and lasted until 11 a.m.\n\nBut Mary Leeze Pearson, Natalee Pearson and Judy McCarville \u2014 sitting in their camping chairs and clad in red, white and blue attire \u2014 caught only the last five minutes of the parade.\n\nThe three women said they had a \u201creally hard time\u201d finding when the parade was scheduled to start \u2014 they found an event scheduled at 11:30 a.m. and showed up a few minutes before 11 a.m., thinking they would have plenty of time to get settled in.\n\nThe Denver.org website, which listed the parade under \u201cThings To Do,\u201d had the event starting at 11:30 a.m. The link on the page, however, leads to a Facebook event for the Veterans Memorial Day Tribute starting at 11:30 a.m.\n\nCorrie Sahling: 303-954-1223, csahling@denverpost.com or twitter.com/corriesahling", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Fallen veterans remembered at Denver Memorial Day ceremony", "title": "Fallen veterans remembered at Denver Memorial Day ceremony", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/05/24/fallen-veterans-remembered-at-denver-memorial-day-ceremony/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140524__2014-05-24-16_51_57-PHOTOS_-Memorial-Day-Parade-and-15th-Annual-Memorial-Day-Tribute-in-Denverp1.jpg", "height": 484}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140524__2014-05-24-16_51_57-PHOTOS_-Memorial-Day-Parade-and-15th-Annual-Memorial-Day-Tribute-in-Denverp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-05-24T16:57:57+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T16:43:06+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc926\"", "article_summary": "\u201cSitting with the Gold Star Families makes it feel like we are all one family,\u201d Bixby said.\nThe link on the page, however, leads to a Facebook event for the Veterans Memorial Day Tribute starting at 11:30 a.m.Corrie Sahling: 303-954-1223, csahling@denverpost.com or twitter.com/corriesahling\nDenver\u2019s 15th annual Veterans Memorial Day Tribute honored 43 \u201cGold Star Families.\u201d The Department of Defense distributes a Gold Star pin to immediate families of servicemen and women who lost their lives in designated military operations.\n\u201cIt is nice to get together with other Gold Star Families that we don\u2019t see very often,\u201d said Nancy Pfander, mother of a fallen serviceman.\nThe two-hour ceremony was filled with speeches and patriotic songs honoring the fallen, living veterans and those on active duty."}
