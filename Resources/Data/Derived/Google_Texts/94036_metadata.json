She was a resident of Wadmalaw Island and also was known as Tameka Lynn Thompson, according to a death notice from Walker\u2019s Mortuary, which is handling her funeral.\n\nAccording to a news release from the Mount Pleasant Police Department, officers were called to the Snowden community about 2:30 a.m. to investigate a homicide. The Snowden community is off Long Point Road near Seacoast Church and Belle Hall Elementary School.\n\nThe release said police had a suspect who was described as a black male wearing all black clothing, 5 -10, 210 pounds and was believed to have been an acquaintance of the victim.\n\nAccording to reports on social media, helicopters could be heard flying over the area shortly before 6 a.m.\n\nMartha Coaxum awoke Saturday morning to flashing lights and investigators combing the property next door to the home she\u2019s lived in since 1955.\n\nDetails of the fatal shooting were sparse Saturday, and Coaxum speculated that those who lived in the area weren\u2019t much the wiser.\n\n\u201cIt happened so early in the morning, everyone around here was probably asleep,\u201d Coaxum said.\n\nThe family that lived in the home where the shooting occurred was relatively quiet, Coaxum said. The same could be said of the surrounding community there, Coaxum said.\n\n\u201cFor that to happen so close to my home \u2014 It unnerved me, that\u2019s for sure,\u201d Coaxum said.\n\nThe shooting was the 14th homicide this year in the tri-county area.\n\nAn incident report providing further details about the shooting was not released Saturday night.\n\nReach Christina Elmore at 937-5908 or at Twitter.com/celmorePC.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Identity of Mount Pleasant homicide victim released, FP LatestNews, \r\nFP LatestNewsMetro, \r\nMetro, crime,Homicide,Mount Pleasant,Snowden", "og": {"site_name": "Post and Courier", "description": "A 38-year-old woman was fatally shot early Saturday in Mount Pleasant\u2019s Snowden community, authorities said.", "title": "Identity of Mount Pleasant homicide victim released", "url": "http://www.postandcourier.com20150404/150409644/identity-of-mount-pleasant-homicide-victim-released", "image": {"url": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20150404/PC16/150409644/AR/0/AR-150409644.jpg", "identifier": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20150404/PC16/150409644/AR/0/AR-150409644.jpg"}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A 38-year-old woman was fatally shot early Saturday in Mount Pleasant\u2019s Snowden community, authorities said.", "title": "Identity of Mount Pleasant homicide victim released", "app": {"country": "US", "name": {"ipad": "Post and Courier", "iphone": "Post and Courier", "googleplay": "Post and Courier"}, "id": {"ipad": 603721271, "iphone": 603721271, "googleplay": "com.Synapse.PandC"}}, "site": "@postandcourier", "image": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20150404/PC16/150409644/AR/0/AR-150409644.jpg?201504042332", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msvalidate.01": "05BAEC9D8820FA9F10D57DB6EB3C6192", "metered": "yes", "p": {"domain_verify": "c6511264bdb6fa45c6bb985fb86d3ab2"}, "fb": {"app_id": 146078808769941}, "tout": {"article": {"id": 150409644}}, "google-site-verification": "rAW9DX7yfiFF82k05QGF6LbZBkxcKxMTzAwNv0OCKAM", "keywords": "Identity of Mount Pleasant homicide victim released , FP LatestNews, \r\nFP LatestNewsMetro, \r\nMetro, crime,Homicide,Mount Pleasant,Snowden", "article": {"published_time": "2015-04-04T07:44:45Z", "modified_time": "2015-04-04T23:32:00Z", "author": "Christina Elmore\r\nDavid MacDougall"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "description": "A 38-year-old woman was fatally shot early Saturday in Mount Pleasant\u2019s Snowden community, authorities said."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf7d4\"", "article_summary": "According to a news release from the Mount Pleasant Police Department, officers were called to the Snowden community about 2:30 a.m. to investigate a homicide.\nA 38-year-old woman was fatally shot early Saturday in Mount Pleasant\u2019s Snowden community, authorities said.\nThe Snowden community is off Long Point Road near Seacoast Church and Belle Hall Elementary School.\nAn incident report providing further details about the shooting was not released Saturday night.\nDetails of the fatal shooting were sparse Saturday, and Coaxum speculated that those who lived in the area weren\u2019t much the wiser."}
