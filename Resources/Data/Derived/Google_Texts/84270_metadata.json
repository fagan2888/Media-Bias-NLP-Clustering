You could study the effects of fracking \u2014 or almost any other topic \u2014 for the next 10 or 20 years and still not have settled every question, especially to the satisfaction of critics who are already convinced that fracking is dangerous and should be banned.\n\nThe measure does mention in passing that state officials have promised a health impact assessment of oil and gas development \u2014 one actually began last year \u2014 but doesn\u2019t say whether a passing grade by the state would satisfy the goal of fully studying the issue. For committed fracking opponents, the answer is almost certainly no.\n\nAfter all, it\u2019s not as if the state study, which will be coordinated by the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment and was scheduled to last three years, is being conducted in an information vacuum. Fracking has occurred in Colorado for more than half a century, and the more lurid claims leveled against it have been repeatedly debunked.\n\nLoveland imposed a drilling moratorium in 2012 that enabled the town to develop enhanced regulations \u2014 a legitimate use of a development timeout. But Question 1 on the current ballot appears to be more of a stall than another genuine pause for information-gathering.\n\nIf Loveland voters do approve the two-year ban, however, it will provide yet more evidence of the risks associated with likely statewide ballot measures this fall to crack down on drilling. In the absence of a legislative compromise in response to the conflict over fracking, voters may end up taking matters into their own hands.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Loveland is the latest front on fracking", "title": "Loveland is the latest front on fracking", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/06/16/loveland-is-the-latest-front-on-fracking/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140616__loveland-frackingp1.jpg", "height": 491}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140616__loveland-frackingp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-06-16T16:40:30+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T05:51:30+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdeaf6\"", "article_summary": "In the absence of a legislative compromise in response to the conflict over fracking, voters may end up taking matters into their own hands.\nObviously Loveland is not equipped to \u201cfully study\u201d the impacts of fracking, and in fact the proposal does nothing to promote or fund the necessary research.\nLoveland imposed a drilling moratorium in 2012 that enabled the town to develop enhanced regulations \u2014 a legitimate use of a development timeout.\nAnd what does \u201cfully study\u201d mean, anyway?\nIf Loveland voters do approve the two-year ban, however, it will provide yet more evidence of the risks associated with likely statewide ballot measures this fall to crack down on drilling."}
