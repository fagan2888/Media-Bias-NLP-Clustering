It states the greater presence of male sexual ornaments signals a stronger vitality for reproduction. These ornaments are typically anatomical in nature, such as the set of feathers on one species of bird or the song of another.\n\nBut in humans the hypothesis hasn\u2019t gotten much attention. So researchers recruited a group of 62 college students, from both Colombia and Spain, to rate the physical attractiveness of select pictures of men who had donated their sperm earlier in the experiment. Researchers censored all but the subjects\u2019 faces, including hairstyle, to minimize external influences.\n\nThey compared levels of attractiveness, masculinity, and sperm health to determine which features, if any, correlated with one another. The results were decidedly lukewarm. While they did find a significant negative relationship between masculine features and sperm motility, the significance vanished when the team controled for outright unhealthy sperm. It was the outliers, in other words, that were doing the heavy lifting.\n\nSo, the hypothesis didn\u2019t seem to ring as true as they might have expected. But they did find a relationship between how males perceived males versus how females perceived males. The subjects most likely to rate the faces as attractive were other men, and particularly among the Spanish students.\n\n\u201cThis suggests that male facial cues may provide culture- and sex-independent information about male fertility,\u201d they wrote. However, it also indicates humans may be poor judges of attractiveness when it comes to people who are culturally near to them. And males, on average, are worse judges than females.\n\nWhat does the study say about the phenotype-linked fertility hypothesis as it relates to humans? Unfortunately, not much. A large camp of evolutionary biology likes to believe the animalistic traits we possessed as ancient hominids have changed to accommodate modern-day mating rituals. All women want tall, protective men in good social standing, they are apt to say. Beneath our material, hi-tech infatuations are primal desires that prove even if we\u2019re a population of smart animals, we\u2019re still animals.\n\nScience is increasingly finding these theories don\u2019t hold much water. Tall men, with their far-reaching gaze, may have the advantage over short men when it comes to scanning the plains for enemies, or dinner, but if a woman\u2019s goal is to keep a tidy house and send her kids to college, short men \u2014 the biological underdogs \u2014 tend to prevail.\n\nPrior research has upheld the link between elevated testosterone levels and poor sperm. In their study, masculine men were thought to have low sperm counts in part because they don\u2019t need as much, being the sexual dynamos they are. However, since the researchers were also measuring attractiveness, it\u2019s worth mentioning the attractive men (who weren\u2019t necessarily masculine) had better sperm. Chalk this one up to round jaws and low cheekbones.\n\nSource: Soler C, Kek\u00e4l\u00e4inen J, N\u00fa\u00f1ez M, et al.
