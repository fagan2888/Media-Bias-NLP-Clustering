And further suppose that this product was a threat to another manufacturer who would suffer long-term erosion of its customer base if this new product really took hold in the marketplace. Would it make sense for the manufacturer of the new product to sit idly by while this rival spent millions and millions of dollars on false advertising about the new product? Would it be reasonable to believe that after being inundated by lies for months the public would be positive about this product and the people who made it?\n\nApparently, that\u2019s what Democratic Senate incumbents are all counting on happening. According to Politico, they are keeping their powder dry for the fall campaign while the Koch brothers and lord knows how many other radical right-wing billionaires spend unlimited sums spreading lies about Obamacare:\n\n[M]any of the most endangered Democratic incumbents have decided it\u2019s better to wait out the barrage than to respond in-kind. They\u2019re gambling that it makes far more sense to build a sizable war chest and hold off until closer to the election to engage their opponents in an expensive TV war. The idea: Absorb the ads from the conservative group Americans for Prosperity now and hope some help from their Democratic allies, like the Senate Majority PAC, helps to keep their races competitive. Then, when the time comes, unleash a flurry of attacks that will give them a late bounce and potentially victory come November.\n\nThat\u2019s a great strategy \u2014 if you\u2019re Muhammad Ali. For normal humans it\u2019s a very big gamble to allow yourself to be relentlessly pummeled in the hopes a late surge of energy will allow you to score a knock-out.\n\nKeep in mind that most people will not have personally dealt with the new program. The vast majority of the American public is covered by employers or direct government programs like Medicare and Veterans Administration. More than 10 million citizens will likely have signed up for Obamacare, most of whom will be pretty happy with the improvements \u2014 which leaves a couple of hundred million, at least, who are only hearing about the program secondhand. Doesn\u2019t it seem logical that hours and hours worth of negative TV propaganda is likely to taint their impression of the program? I\u2019m afraid your average voter in North Carolina or Alaska doesn\u2019t pay a lot of attention to the Washington Post\u2019s fact-checking columns.\n\nNaturally, Politico sees this issue through the Beltway\u2019s conservative lens and says the risk is that Democrats will be seen as \u201capologists for President Barack Obama and his health care law before they\u2019ve defined themselves to undecided voters\u201d which is just daft. The risk is that the program will be seen as a failure. They can\u2019t run from it. Anyone with a D after his or her name will have to defend it whether they like it or not. It\u2019s the Democratic Party\u2019s signature legislation of this era, for better or worse, and there\u2019s no point in trying to pretend otherwise. The longer they wait to make sure the people see the program in a positive light, the harder it will be to change their perceptions.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Right-wing billionaires are rushing the airwaves with lies about Obamacare.
