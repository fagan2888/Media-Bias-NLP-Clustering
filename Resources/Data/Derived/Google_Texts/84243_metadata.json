O\u2019Hanlon will replace former marketing director Laura Robbins.\n\nNicole Thorell, chief nursing officer with LRHC, said during the nursing service report that staff has received a lot of positive feedback about the patient rooms during community tours. The new comfortable beds and modern call system for patients are very popular, she said.\n\nDuring his service excellence report, Jim Hain, addressed comments made at two previous forums for candidates for the board of directors about the culture at LRHC.\n\n\u201cReferring to the culture that has changed in the last few years, I\u2019m proud to say it\u2019s been for the better. We are much more open to change, we have more multi-disciplinary teams. This improves our quality and improves relationships. We encourage our staff to come to us with their concerns and resolutions. This administration values our staff,\u201d Hain said.\n\nBoard member Amber Ackerson said she was one of the first people to receive treatment from a new operating room in the Outpatient Specialty Clinic.\n\n\u201cIt was awesome considering it was just opening. Dr. Bryan Scheer said the new Outpatient Specialty Clinic is hands-down the best he works in and he helped build a new one in Wyoming,\u201d Ackerson said.\n\nShe said Scheer told her he could have had his pick of hospital to practice in, and chose LRHC\u2019s new clinic because it\u2019s a strong hospital that is contributing to a strong community.\n\nNo quality report was given. Don Young, executive director of ancillary services, gave a brief construction report. Young said construction and renovations had gone well for the East Wing of patient rooms, which would be opened for service next Tuesday.\n\nAfter the completion of the East Wing of patient rooms, construction would shift to the South Wing of patient rooms, with construction expected to be completed by June 4, Young said.\n\nDenker gave a virtuous organization update. She said the April topic for LRHC\u2019s virtuous organization program was happiness. Denker said the staff training promotes deeper collaboration and the importance of teamwork.\n\n\u201cMorale is stronger than ever,\u201d Denker said.\n\nAs a human resources worker, Denker said she is concerned about the shortage of nurses nationally. Two big factors contributing to the shortage of trained nurses are the impact of the Affordable Care Act and the retirement of baby boomer era nurses.\n\nThorell echoed Denker\u2019s concern about the future pipeline of nurses, but stressed LRHC is well staffed with the needed amount of nurses.\n\n\u201cWe are one of the few facilities in the area not using traveling nurses. We have two new RNs and two new LPNs,\u201d Thorell said.\n\nDue to the high demand of nurses nationally and in Nebraska, Thorell said nurses can practice \u201cwherever they want to and ask for whatever they want to.\u201d\n\nThe easiest way for hospitals to have a supply of nursing talent is to \u201cgrow your own or snatch them up from others,\u201d Thorell said.\n\nAlthough money is important, having nurses enjoy where they work made a difference in retaining and recruiting nurses, Thorell said.\n\nWade Eschenbrenner, LRHC\u2019s chief financial officer, gave the board members a financial report for March.\n\nFinancial data for March includes: 96 acute patient days, 92 swing bed days, 13 newborn days and an average daily census of 7.65. Average age of plant was 16.55. The average age of plant measures the average accounting age of a hospital\u2019s capital assets.\n\nThe days in net accounts receivable for March was 80.88 and days cash on hand was 135. The days in net accounts receivable measures the days that it takes an organization on average to collect its receivables. Days cash on hand measures the number of days an organization could operate if no cash was collected or received.\n\nThe operating profit margin for March was 1.97 percent and total profit margin for the month was 1.99 percent. Year-to-date operating profit margin for March was -1.89, with total profit margin for the year-to-date was -0.73 percent.\n\nTara Naprstek, a LRHC board member with accounting experience, noted that the financials showed a 10 percent increase in operating revenue compared to last year.\n\nToward the end of the meeting, Leslie Marsh, chief executive officer of LRHC, gave a brief overview PowerPoint presentation about the role and responsibilities of a member on the hospital\u2019s board of directors.\n\n\u201cA board member has a fiduciary duty for and through the hospital, of loyalty to avoid conflict. Every decision you make is for the best interest of the hospital,\u201d Marsh said.\n\nBoard members would be expected to support the hospital amidst the growing burden of healthcare regulations and be actively involved in crafting the hospital\u2019s mission, vision and overseeing strategic planning.\n\nBoard members also were involved in organizing the hospital\u2019s agenda around the pillars of: people, service, excellence and quality.\n\nAn open house with ribbon cutting for the Outpatient Specialty Clinic at LRHC will be held Monday, May 2 from 5:30 to 7:30 p.m. Refreshments will be served. The event is open to the public, with Sen. Matt Williams set to attend.\n\nOn Tuesday, May 3, LRHC will host an open house for its Elwood Clinic from 4:30 to 6:30 p.m. The event is open to the public.", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "news_keywords": "news,local", "og": {"site_name": "Lexington Clipper-Herald", "description": "LEXINGTON, Neb. \u2013 Lexington Regional Health Center announced the hiring of a new marketing director during the monthly board of directors meeting on Tuesday night.", "title": "Hospital board recap: New marketing director hired", "url": "http://lexch.com/news/hospital-board-recap-new-marketing-director-hired/article_e74a7d96-0e28-11e6-8a3f-d3e4b2010343.html", "image": {"width": 720, "identifier": "http://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/lexch.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/4/35/4352b8f6-0e29-11e6-95a0-73b33bbff5b0/57238f0277e01.image.jpg?resize=720%2C396", "height": 396}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@tweetmeme", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"app_id": 187962337953864}, "keywords": "news,local", "description": "LEXINGTON, Neb. \u2013 Lexington Regional Health Center announced the hiring of a new marketing director during the monthly board of directors meeting on Tuesday night."}, "article_summary": "Financial data for March includes: 96 acute patient days, 92 swing bed days, 13 newborn days and an average daily census of 7.65.\nJill Denker, executive director of human resources and physician liaison, announced that Meredith O\u2019Hanlon was hired as the new director of marketing.\nAlthough money is important, having nurses enjoy where they work made a difference in retaining and recruiting nurses, Thorell said.\nTara Naprstek, a LRHC board member with accounting experience, noted that the financials showed a 10 percent increase in operating revenue compared to last year.\n\u2013 Lexington Regional Health Center announced the hiring of a new marketing director during the monthly board of directors meeting on Tuesday night."}
