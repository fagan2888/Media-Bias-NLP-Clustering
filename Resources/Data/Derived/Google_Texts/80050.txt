Nautic Procures Aerostar, Leveraging Rising Demand for Airplane Parts

Recently, Warren Buffetts Berkshire Hathaway bought Precision Castparts, and Blackstone picked up MB Aerospace

Nautic Partners LLC is buying Aerostar Aerospace Manufacturing LLC.

Financial terms were not disclosed, the middle-market PE firm typically invests $25 million to $75 million in companies that have up to $30 million in Ebitda.

Aerostar, based in Phoenix and founded in 1983, produces casting parts that are made out of titanium and are used in airplane engines. The target is in the middle of expanding with plans to move into a new manufacturing facility and upgrade its equipment that will eventually double production capabilities.

“The outlook for the commercial aerospace market is attractive, yet the supply chain for critical machined components remains quite fragmented,” says Nautic managing director Chris Pierce.

Demand for new airplane parts continues to drive deal activity in the aerospace sector. Recently, the Blackstone Group LP (NYSE: BX) said it will acquire aerospace engine maker MB Aerospace from Arlington Capital Partners, and PE-backed Imaginetics LLC announced plans to purchase Azmark Aerosystems LLC. Also announced earlier in 2015, Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE: BRK.A) has agreed to add Precision Castparts for $37 billion.

Greene Holcomb and Fischer is advising Aerostar. Nautic is receiving financing from the National Bank of Arizona.
