Bill O’Reilly laughed and rolled his eyes at David Duke on his show tonight when Duke adamantly denied being a white supremacist. O’Reilly said if that’s the case, why is he still affiliated with a group with the goal of promoting the interests of “the white European race.”

O’Reilly started out by discussing the Steve Scalise controversy, but that quickly went out the window once Duke accused the media of hypocrisy. He said that the press always talks about him being a former KKK member but never Democrat Robert Byrd when he was alive. O’Reilly pointed out that Byrd “repudiated his past” whereas Duke continues to be affiliated with the European-American Unity and Rights Organization (currently designated as a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center).

O’Reilly told Duke, “Don’t sit there and tell me you’re not a white––your organization isn’t looking out for the white European race.” He agreed with Duke on some of the points he made about media hypocrisy, but otherwise, he told Duke he’s trying to promote the cause of white people and Duke’s line about “preserving your heritage” came off a little wrong to O’Reilly.
