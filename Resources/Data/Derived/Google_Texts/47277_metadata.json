Loos said that will change over the next month or so to on-site collection and processing by one, full-time employee.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re basically removing all the containers behind King Soopers now and everything will be handled inside the building,\u201d Loos said, referring to a building behind the grocery store. \u201cThat is how we\u2019re going to keep hours.\u201d\n\nLoos said most operating hours will likely be Thursday through Monday, and possibly a few hours Tuesdays and Wednesdays, depending on community needs.\n\nThe EDS transfer station at 5801 County Road 73 \u2014 which also offered free recycling drop-off, in addition to household trash and industrial waste collection \u2014 is closing at the request of Denver Mountain Parks, which owns the property. Denver Mountain Parks notified EDS about a year ago that it would be reclaiming the 3.5 acres of land for integration into its 520-acre Cub Creek Park over the next two or three years.\n\nDenver Parks and Recreation spokeswoman Angela Casias said EDS\u2019 transfer station was in violation of the deed for the land with the U.S. Forest Service. However, EDS was allowed to operate there because as the trash collector for Denver Mountain Parks, it was seen as a benefit to the park system. Casias said that when Denver decided to sign an agreement with a new trash service provider, that exception no longer existed.\n\n\u201cThis is land that was not intended for this purpose, so it\u2019s really out of our hands as far as what happens,\u201d she said.\n\nDenver\u2019s trash provider as of 2011, Waste Management, purchased EDS\u2019 trash and recycling collection, said Waste Management communications specialist Lara Rezzarday. The recycling center at King Soopers is EDS\u2019s only operation as of Oct. 1.\n\nWith the transfer station closing, EDS anticipates about a 10 percent increase in the traffic that currently takes its recycling to the site behind King Soopers, from around 73 tons per month to 80-85 tons per month.\n\nThat increase will be a benefit rather than a strain, he said.\n\n\u201cIf we can reach 85 tons a month, then that will increase the likelihood of us staying there,\u201d he said.\n\nLoos said he will try to keep the recycling center drop-off free for the time being, but he does not rule out the possibility of a fee if that is the only way the facility can stay afloat.\n\n\u201cThis is a completely new thing in the way we\u2019re going to be operating moving forward,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a trial run. We\u2019re trying to identify how we can make this sustainable.\u201d\n\nJosie Klemaier: 303-954-2465, jklemaier@denverpost.com or twitter.com/JosieKlemaier", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Evergreen trash and recycling transfer station closes Sept. 30", "title": "Evergreen trash and recycling transfer station closes Sept. 30", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/09/29/evergreen-trash-and-recycling-transfer-station-closes-sept-30/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "height": 630}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-09-29T13:26:14+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-09-29T13:26:14+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdba9a\"", "article_summary": "After tomorrow, EDS Waste Solutions\u2019 transfer station and recycling center will be closed, leaving the company with only one remaining foothold in the community.\nDenver\u2019s trash provider as of 2011, Waste Management, purchased EDS\u2019 trash and recycling collection, said Waste Management communications specialist Lara Rezzarday.\n\u201cAs of right now, it\u2019s a desire of ours and of King Soopers to keep that facility going,\u201d Loos said.\nDenver Parks and Recreation spokeswoman Angela Casias said EDS\u2019 transfer station was in violation of the deed for the land with the U.S. Forest Service.\nThe Evergreen-based company will continue to operate the recycling center behind King Soopers at 1173 Bergen Parkway, said EDS co-owner Preston Loos."}
