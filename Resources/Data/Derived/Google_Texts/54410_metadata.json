Chris Christie, who did so poorly in the Granite State that he did have to go home to New Jersey and \u201csuspend\u201d his presidential campaign. \u201cSuspending\u201d a campaign is the 21st century term for \u201cYou can stick a fork in me because I\u2019m done.\u201d\n\nKasich, who spent a whole lot of money but who had a ground game to match it, doesn\u2019t have to go home, as he said he would do if he didn\u2019t do well in New Hampshire.\n\nBut where does he go from here? How does he navigate through a slew of primaries and caucuses between now and March 15, when (he hopes) his home state Republicans will hand him the Ohio primary and the 66 delegates that go along with it.\n\nThe answer: Very carefully.\n\n\u201cHis campaign has to feel very good about how Kasich did in New Hampshire,\u2019\u2019 said Mack Mariani, associate professor and chair of the political science department of Xavier University. \u201cBut, on the other hand, they have to be realistic about what lies ahead of them.\u201d\n\nThat would be South Carolina and a host of other conservative states that may not be so friendly to a Republican who has positioned himself as the moderate of the bunch, the voice of reason.\n\nThe morning after the New Hampshire primary, Kasich\u2019s traveling road show packed up its tent and headed straight for its next, and more difficult, test \u2013 South Carolina, where Republicans are holding the next primary on Feb. 20.\n\nBeginning on Wednesday morning, Kasich launched a series of \u201ctown hall\u201d meetings around the Palmetto State, starting with a town hall meeting that drew quite a crowd to a pizza parlor in Charleston.\n\nCNN was there, along with a mob of other news outlets; and ended up doing a report on the Kasich event based on the theme that the pundits say helped Kasich do well in New Hampshire \u2013 his positive, upbeat message and his refusal to hammer at his opponents. As the Ohio governor described himself last month in New Hampshire, he is the \u201cprince of light and hope\u201d \u2013 a characterization that makes many of his detractors in the Buckeye State gag.\n\nIn the CNN piece, one woman was interviewed who said she likes the Ohio governor \u201cbecause he\u2019s very positive and he doesn\u2019t bash the other candidates.\u201d\n\nAnother woman summed it up nicely for CNN: \u201cHe\u2019s the total opposite of Donald Trump.\u201d\n\nThere was a sound bite of Kasich, responding to someone in the crowd, saying, \u201cWell, look, sir, I\u2019ve always been a believer in a positive campaign.\u201d\n\nThis might come as a surprise to someone like former governor Ted Strickland, who was figuratively beaten around the head and shoulders routinely by Kasich in the 2010 campaign, when Kasich took the governor\u2019s office from Strickland by two percentage points.\n\nBut, there\u2019s no doubt about it \u2013 in the debates, in the pizza parlors, in the coffee shops of New Hampshire, Kasich\u2019s message was simple \u2013 if this nation is to solve its problems, people have to put aside their differences and work together.\n\nIt resonated well with many New Hampshire Republican moderates and many of the independent voters who took a GOP ballot in New Hampshire\u2019s open primary.\n\nThe conventional wisdom (which is often more conventional than wise) holds that Kasich may have a tough row to hoe ahead of him as the battle for the GOP nomination shifts to many states where the Republican electorate is very conservative and not particularly receptive to messages of \u201clight and hope.\u201d South Carolina may be one of those states.\n\nSouth Carolina is a state chock full of evangelical Christian voters. Nationally, they\u2019ve been flocking mostly to Cruz and Ben Carson.\n\nFriday, the Kasich campaign began airing two new TV ads in South Carolina.\n\nOne of them is clearly aimed at those evangelicals.\n\nIn the ad, called \u201cHealing,\u201d Kasich talks of his father, a postman, telling him that \u201cJohnny, you stand on your own two feet. You go out there and change the world.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy parents were killed by a drunk driver, but my parents did not die in vain,\u2019\u2019 Kasich says in the ad. \u201cI was transformed. I discovered my purpose by discovering the Lord. I believe the Lord put us on this earth to use the gifts that we\u2019ve been given to bringing about a healing. And that\u2019s the motivation for me.\u201d\n\nIt is a message that could play well in South Carolina.\n\n\u201cClearly, he is trying to appeal to that Christian conservative vote,\u2019\u2019 Mariani said. \u201cHe has to, in order to have any chance at all in South Carolina.\u201d\n\nThe Palmetto State is followed by the Nevada caucus on Feb. 23. Both South Carolina and Nevada are seen as states where the angry, tough guy message of a Trump or the appeal of Cruz to social conservatives might carry more weight than Kasich\u2019s more moderate message.\n\nThen, on March 1, there is Super Tuesday \u2013 15 states holding primaries and caucuses.\n\nThere are southern states, some of them Deep South states, where a Trump or a Cruz might have more appeal than the Ohio governor who has cut out his niche as the \u201cvoice of reason\u2019\u2019 in the still-muddled GOP field.\n\nSuper Tuesday also includes two states that are neighbors to New Hampshire, Massachusetts and Vermont. Kasich\u2019s chances may be better there. Virginia, too, is one of the few southern states where a mainstream Republican like Kasich might have a chance.\n\nBut the problem with Vermont, Massachusetts, and Virginia is the fact that Trump did so well in New Hampshire. Could he repeat that in the Super Tuesday states? Does an Ohio governor who is still hovering in the low single-digits in the national polls and who has been dubbed \u201cthe Democrats\u2019 favorite Republican\u201d have a chance of knocking Trump off his pedestal?\n\nKyle Kondik, managing editor of Sabato\u2019s Crystal Ball at the University of Virginia\u2019s Center for Politics, said that Kasich really needs to find a way to have some success in winning delegates between now and the March 15 Ohio primary.\n\n\u201cI suppose that is why he\u2019s spending time and money in Michigan, which could be good ground for him,\u2019\u2019 Kondik said of Ohio\u2019s neighbor to the north, which holds its primary on March 8.\n\nKondik thinks, too, that Kasich should focus on Illinois, which holds its primary on the same day as Ohio.\n\n\u201cOf course, he has to win Ohio, but I\u2019m not convinced that Ohio is a slam dunk for Kasich,\u2019\u2019 Kondik said. \u201cThese campaigns have become more nationalized. The home town favorite doesn\u2019t always win.\u201d\n\nIt would help if circumstances in the next round of primaries and caucuses were to narrow the field. Bush may be hanging on by a thread; and his fellow Floridian, Marco Rubio, has some major damage repair after his poor performance in the final debate before New Hampshire, where he gained the reputation as a scripted, robotic candidate.\n\n\u201cWhat John Kasich has to do is find a way to outlast Bush and Rubio,\u2019\u2019 Kondik said. \u201cThen, he can focus on dealing with Trump and Cruz.\u201d\n\nBush knows he has to somehow knock down Kasich in order to become a viable candidate again. That explains why, in South Carolina, Bush was criticizing Kasich for taking federal money under Obamacare to expand Medicaid.\n\nKasich responded that he wants to repeal Obamacare, but defended Medicaid expansion in Ohio because, he said, it is the right thing to do.\n\n\u201cI think Bush\u2019s presence in the race hurts Kasich a lot,\u2019\u2019 Mariani said. \u201cThe sooner Bush gets out the better for Kasich.\u201d\n\nIn the end, one of the remaining candidates will become the one to seriously challenge Trump and Cruz, two candidates who are disliked intensely by the GOP establishment.\n\nBut if it is to be Kasich, he will have to navigate a tricky minefield of states that are not at all like New Hampshire, which was full of voters eager to hear his positive, hopeful message.\n\nHe has to find a way to do it, though, if he is to reach the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow \u2013 good ol\u2019 Ohio, home sweet home, and its 66-delegate, winner-take-all primary.\n\nIf, indeed, that turns out to the true pot of gold that leads him to the presidential nomination.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Politics", "description": "Well, no need for John Kasich to pack his bags, come home and go back to his day job as Ohio\u2019s governor.
