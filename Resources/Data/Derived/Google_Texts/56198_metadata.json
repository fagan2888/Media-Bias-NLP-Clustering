According to the U.S. Geological Survey, the earthquake was a 4.5 magnitude.\n\nIt was recorded at 12:10 p.m.\n\nThe epicenter was located about one mile southeast of Lake Arcadia, about five miles northwest of Jones, seven miles east of Edmond, nine miles north, northwest of Choctaw, and 14 miles northeast of Oklahoma City.\n\nPaul Caruso, a geophysicist with the U.S. Geological Survey, characterized it as a shallow quake that might knock items from shelves and cause light fixtures to sway.\n\nCaruso said it is likely part of the swarm of quakes that have struck near the Jones area over the past few years. It was felt as far south as Wichita Falls, Texas, and as far north as Wichita, Kansas, he said.\n\n\n\nIt was about five miles deep.\n\nKenna Carmon with the Oklahoma Department of Transportation says ODOT crews have been checking their roads and bridges in a 15 mile radius from the epicenter and have found no damage.\n\nNews On 6 offices shook noticeably in what felt like two waves. Viewers in many Oklahoma cities, including Oklahoma City, Edmond, Tulsa, Broken Arrow, Stillwater, and Guthrie reported feeling the earthquake.\n\nReport your experience\n\n\n\nComment below if you experienced the earthquake, giving your location.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"wn-build": "XSLT-7.1-17", "Description": "According to the U.S. Geological Survey, the 4.5 magnitude earthquake was recorded at 12:10 p.m. The Oklahoma Geological Survey is calling it 4.8.", "author": "Dee Duren", "og": {"url": "http://www.newson6.com/story/24161383/oklahomans-report-experiencing-earthquake", "image": "http://KOTV.images.worldnow.com/images/24161383_SA.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "According to the U.S. Geological Survey, the 4.5 magnitude earthquake was recorded at 12:10 p.m. The Oklahoma Geological Survey is calling it 4.8.", "title": "Earthquake Rocks Central Oklahoma Saturday"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://KOTV.images.worldnow.com/images/24161383_SA.jpg", "description": "According to the U.S. Geological Survey, the 4.5 magnitude earthquake was recorded at 12:10 p.m. The Oklahoma Geological Survey is calling it 4.8.", "card": "summary", "title": "Earthquake Rocks Central Oklahoma Saturday"}, "wnreadableurl": "oklahomans-report-experiencing-earthquake", "ROBOTS": "Index,Follow,NoArchive", "owner": "KOTV", "fb": {"app_id": 497059410331845}, "date": "2013/12/07", "KEYWORDS": "tulsa,media,news,weather,tv,cbs,local,tornado,storm,oklahoma,kotv.com,channel 6,channel six,green country,television,the news on 6,the news on six,six in the morning,live", "wn-version": "ContainerE-Story", "wn-base": "IIS25", "verify-v1": "67+ifqPKEX7ZTB2sopjxTD1c6nx6ScxupNN92EqnIpc=", "news_keywords": "tulsa,media,news,weather,tv,cbs,local,tornado,storm,oklahoma,kotv.com,channel 6,channel six,green country,television,the news on 6,the news on six,six in the morning,live"}, "article_summary": "A 4.8 magnitude earthquake rocked central Oklahoma Saturday afternoon, according to the Oklahoma Geological Survey.\nViewers in many Oklahoma cities, including Oklahoma City, Edmond, Tulsa, Broken Arrow, Stillwater, and Guthrie reported feeling the earthquake.\nAccording to the U.S. Geological Survey, the earthquake was a 4.5 magnitude.\nPaul Caruso, a geophysicist with the U.S. Geological Survey, characterized it as a shallow quake that might knock items from shelves and cause light fixtures to sway.\nThe epicenter was located about one mile southeast of Lake Arcadia, about five miles northwest of Jones, seven miles east of Edmond, nine miles north, northwest of Choctaw, and 14 miles northeast of Oklahoma City."}
