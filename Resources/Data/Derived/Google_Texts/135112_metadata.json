The honor is doubly significant in that this is ACR\u2019s first entry in the five-year-old survey.\n\n\u201cWe define ourselves every time we hire somebody,\u201d Nelson said. \u201cWe work to select people who want to take care of other people. Our gift to them is to give them the opportunity to do what they have a passion for.\u201d\n\nOccupational therapist Jasmine McGiffert worked with Cecily Evans at St. David\u2019s Center in Minnetonka.\n\nACR Homes is one of three organizations new to the top workplace list for companies with more than 500 employees.\n\nThe other two are St. David\u2019s Center, a social-services provider that focuses on childhood development programs, at No. 21 and Canterbury Park, the horse racetrack and card casino, at No. 24.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re doing such valuable work in the lives of children and their families, there is an authentic belief that we couldn\u2019t be engaged in more important work,\u201d said Julie Sjordal, executive director of St. David\u2019s, a Minnetonka nonprofit that offers programs ranging from early childhood education to work with children and older individuals with developmental disabilities. Sjordal calls St. David\u2019s a \u201cflat organization in terms of I don\u2019t think I\u2019m doing anything more important than the guy who cleans the building in the evening.\u201d\n\nTypical of the response of St. David\u2019s employees responding to the workplace survey was one who wrote, \u201cI love spending time with the girl I care for, and I feel like I am making a positive impact on her life.\u201d\n\nAt Canterbury Park, entertainment is king.\n\n\u201cCanterbury is awesome to work for,\u201d one employee commented on the survey. \u201cThey encourage each and every employee to strive to do their best while having fun at work.\u201d\n\n\u201cCanterbury does not micromanage its employees,\u201d said another.\n\nThere\u2019s a reason for that, Canterbury CEO Randy Sampson said. \u201cOur goals are quite simple \u2014 we want to provide enjoyment for our guests. It\u2019s pretty difficult to create fun for your guests if your employees aren\u2019t having fun as well, so we consciously work very hard to ensure our environment remains an enjoyable place to work,\u201d Sampson said.\n\nOther top workplaces among large companies range from Keller Williams Realty, a perennial top finisher, at No. 2, to Buffalo-Hanover-Montrose schools at No. 30. Among those in between are the Minnesota Twins (No. 6), Securian Financial Group (No. 13) and Whole Foods (No. 19).\n\nThe top 30 large companies include 10 private firms, nine nonprofits, seven public companies, two cooperatives and two school districts.\n\nBy area of specialty, health and developmental care is the largest category represented on the list with eight organizations, followed by financial services with six.\n\nACR Homes places a heavy emphasis on communication.\n\n\u201cEighty-five to 95 percent of what we do is based on the suggestions of our employees,\u201d said Jim Nelson, citing a successful company-owned coffee shop where clients and neighbors gather daily. That idea came up from the ranks.\n\n\u201cIf someone has an idea, we always get back to them,\u201d Nelson said. \u201cIt gives employees a positive ownership attitude.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Minnesota large companies' Top Workplaces: ACR Homes, St. David\u2019s Center, Canterbury Park, Keller Williams Realty, Buffalo-Hanover-Montrose schools, Minnesota Twins, Securian Financial Group and Whole Foods", "og": {"site_name": "Star Tribune", "description": "Minnesota large companies' Top Workplaces: ACR Homes, St. David\u2019s Center, Canterbury Park, Keller Williams Realty, Buffalo-Hanover-Montrose schools, Minnesota Twins, Securian Financial Group and Whole Foods", "title": "Top large companies: Making the right hires", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/top-large-companies-making-the-right-hires/262767711/", "image": {"url": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/08_488441__03TOPLARGE061514_29859937.JPG?h=630&w=1200&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=top", "width": 1200, "identifier": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/08_488441__03TOPLARGE061514_29859937.JPG?h=630&w=1200&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=top", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Minnesota large companies' Top Workplaces: ACR Homes, St. David\u2019s Center, Canterbury Park, Keller Williams Realty, Buffalo-Hanover-Montrose schools, Minnesota Twins, Securian Financial Group and Whole Foods", "title": "Top large companies: Making the right hires", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/top-large-companies-making-the-right-hires/262767711/", "image": {"src": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/08_488441__03TOPLARGE061514_29859937.JPG?h=560&w=750&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=top", "identifier": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/08_488441__03TOPLARGE061514_29859937.JPG?h=560&w=750&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=top"}, "site": "@StarTribune", "card": "summary"}, "article": {"tag": "Whole Foods"}, "google-site-verification": "bLXTXkzm4dJ8hcJy1LXawtxXxGP3JhInARj69uCiMiM", "news_keywords": "Top Workplaces, ACR Homes,St. David\u2019s Center,Canterbury Park,Keller Williams Realty,Buffalo-Hanover-Montrose schools,Minnesota Twins,Securian Financial Group,Whole Foods"}, "article_summary": "The top 30 large companies include 10 private firms, nine nonprofits, seven public companies, two cooperatives and two school districts.\nOther top workplaces among large companies range from Keller Williams Realty, a perennial top finisher, at No.\n\u201cI\u2019ve always said the most valuable resource we have is right between the ears of our employees,\u201d Nelson said in a recent interview.\n1 ranking in the Star Tribune\u2019s Top Workplaces survey of large Minnesota companies.\nThe other two are St. David\u2019s Center, a social-services provider that focuses on childhood development programs, at No."}
