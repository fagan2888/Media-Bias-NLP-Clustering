Industry leaders from AEC Firms to healthcare providers come together for three days of education and collaboration. The Healthcare Facilities Symposium & Expo will take place October 6-8, 2015 in Chicago with pre-conference events on October 5, 2015.\n\nResonating through the event is the theme of At the Intersection of Design and Wellness. A comprehensive focus on wellness begins long before our first caregiver interaction. The impacts felt throughout the entire healthcare community are real and significant, as business models shift, treatment plans change and consumers become more sophisticated, involved and independent.\n\nAt the Intersection of Design and Wellness is echoed by keynote presenter Rick Evans, Chief Experience Officer at Massachusetts General Hospital. Evans will address how patient expectations about healthcare are rapidly evolving. With the emergence of models that focus on payment for outcomes and an ongoing shift to patients paying out of pocket for their care, we are all becoming healthcare \u201ccustomers\u201d in addition to being patients. \u201cI am excited about sharing the perspective of someone working on the ground everyday on improving the patient experience with this group of professionals. How we design our facilities and services has such a significant impact on the experience of those we serve and I am very much looking forward to the dialogue!\u201d says Evans.\n\nThe conference program will feature sessions presented by leading healthcare providers, AEC firms and researchers. Case-studies and instructional sessions will tackle issues challenging design teams today including integrating technology, influence of the Affordable Care Act, sustainability, renovation projects, and the task of doing more with less.\n\nReturning for the third year is the Student Charette brokered through a partnership of Assa Abloy, The CARITAS Project, Chicago AIA and the CAIA Healthcare Knowledge Community. Promoting interaction and idea exchange between university students and attendees, this year\u2019s design challenge will be Through the Looking Glass. And ask how would today\u2019s students (next year\u2019s healthcare design leaders!) re-envision a significant current healthcare project here in Chicago.\n\nDetails: The 2015 Healthcare Facilities Symposium & Expo includes:\n\nEducational sessions featuring case-studies and instructional sessions presented by the upper echelon of thought leaders and industry authorities.\n\nfeaturing case-studies and instructional sessions presented by the upper echelon of thought leaders and industry authorities.
