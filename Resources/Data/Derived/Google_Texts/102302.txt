The University of Mississippi is taking steps to promote racial diversity and provide context for Old South symbols that Chancellor Dan Jones says "are too often viewed as an endorsement of ancient ideas."

In a report Friday, Jones says two streets on the Oxford campus will be renamed and plaques could be installed to provide historical context for symbols such as a Confederate soldier statue near the main administrative building.

A short street near Fraternity Row will be renamed from Confederate Drive to Chapel Lane.

Coliseum Drive will be renamed Roy Lee "Chucky" Mullins Drive, after a black Ole Miss football player who was left quadriplegic by a 1989 game injury and died in 1991.

The report recommends creating a new job of vice chancellor for diversity and inclusion.
