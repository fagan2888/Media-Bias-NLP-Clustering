Health professionals now offer everyone who comes to the hospital the option of an HIV test, no matter what they are being treated for.\n\nSince the program was instituted in 2013, the hospital is averaging 2 to 3 new diagnoses per day.\n\n\u201cThis is something that keeps me awake at night in Atlanta,\u201d said Dr. Abigail Hankin-Wei, director of Grady\u2019s FOCUS HIV program.\n\n\u201cWhen we diagnose patients with HIV, the first time we are telling them they\u2019ve been infected with HIV, we know that among our patients at Grady, nearly half of them have AIDS the day we diagnose them,\u201d the doctor explained.\n\nPeople are all too often unaware that they have been infected. They spend the 8 to 10 years it takes for untreated HIV to incubate having unprotected sex and taking no measures to contain or weaken the virus\u2019 ticking time-bomb assault on their immune systems.\n\nWendy Armstrong, the director of the Ponce de Leon Center \u2014 an AIDS care facility in Atlanta \u2014 told WABE that young people often carry the virus undetected because, ironically, they\u2019re too healthy to merit close medical scrutiny.\n\n\u201cOur massive group out there who are not tested are folks out there who often don\u2019t have primary care physicians because they\u2019re young, and there\u2019s not a need for that and no insurance if they did wish to have a primary care physician,\u201d Armstrong said.\n\nThe state of Georgia has fought the expansion of Medicaid recommended under the terms of the Affordable Care Act. As a result, millions of people in the state who could be seeking medical treatment are not.\n\nFurthermore, when people are diagnosed, they often do not have the means to afford the medicines that could help manage their condition and lower the amount of virus in their blood.\n\nRates of HIV transmission in Georgia are among the highest in the country and are only going higher. The state\u2019s uneven patchwork of public health programs means that AIDS treatments and survival rates can swing dramatically from one part of the state to another.\n\nThe CDC and other agencies have pointed out that HIV patients fare markedly more poorly in overall quality of life and lifespan in the southern states, with Georgia among the nine worst.\n\nA Duke University study found that \u201cThe South had the nation\u2019s lowest five-year survival rate for those diagnosed with HIV/AIDS with 15 percent of people with HIV and 27 percent with AIDS dying within the first five years of their diagnosis.\u201d\n\nA 2014 study by the CDC found that merely 30 percent of people in the U.S. with HIV were currently taking steps to treat the virus and slow its attack on their bodies.\n\nIn South Africa, studies found that \u201c(i)n 2009, an estimated 17.9% of the adult population was living with HIV. This is estimated to be 5.63 million people, including 3.3 million women and 334,000 children.\u201d\n\nBecause health care is only patchily available to parts of the country, HIV-positive South Africans contract deadly new forms of Tuberculosis and other infections. Rates of infection are high and rates of detection are low, meaning that survival rates and prognoses for the infected are poor.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": {"width": 800, "identifier": "http://www.rawstory.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Patient-with-IV-line-via-Shutterstock-800x430.jpg", "height": 430}, "title": "When it comes to AIDS, Georgia is a lot like South Africa \u2014 a deadly health care disaster"}, "fb": {"app_id": 212555972273585}, "viewport": "width=device-width, user-scalable=yes, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=0.1, maximum-scale=10.0"}, "article_summary": "This is estimated to be 5.63 million people, including 3.3 million women and 334,000 children.\u201dBecause health care is only patchily available to parts of the country, HIV-positive South Africans contract deadly new forms of Tuberculosis and other infections.\nThe state of Georgia has fought the expansion of Medicaid recommended under the terms of the Affordable Care Act.\nIn South Africa, studies found that \u201c(i)n 2009, an estimated 17.9% of the adult population was living with HIV.\nRates of HIV transmission in Georgia are among the highest in the country and are only going higher.\nHealth professionals now offer everyone who comes to the hospital the option of an HIV test, no matter what they are being treated for."}
