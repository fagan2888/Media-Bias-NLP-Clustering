I was just trying to throw as hard as I could, and I didn\u2019t know any better. I was having a great game up until that one pitch.\u201d\n\nThat pitch altered his life.\n\n\u201cIt popped. I could hear it,\u201d he said. \u201cI had no idea what the sound was at the time. I thought I just pulled a muscle. I took three days off and tried to throw, and I couldn\u2019t make it to 90 feet. The ball just didn\u2019t go anywhere. So I had an MRI, and it was completely torn.\u201d\n\nJust 16 at the time, Binford joined the list of Tommy John surgery alumni.\n\nElbow ligament-replacement surgery isn\u2019t just for big leaguers these days. More than two dozen major leaguers have had the elbow ligament replacement operation in the last year, a group that includes Miami\u2019s Jose Fernandez, the New York Mets\u2019 Matt Harvey and Tampa Bay\u2019s Matt Moore. New York Yankees star Masahiro Tanaka has a partially torn ulnar collateral ligament and may need the procedure.\n\nAt least three players at the All-Star Futures game already had the surgery: Binford, a Double-A right-hander in the Kanas City Royals organization, was joined by Lucas Giolito, a Class A righty with the Washington Nationals who was the 16th overall pick in the 2012 draft, and Steven Moya, a Double-A outfielder with the Detroit Tigers.\n\n\u201cSad to say,\u201d Giolito explained, \u201cit\u2019s kind of become a kind of routine deal for pitchers \u2014 hopefully not all of them.\u201d\n\nSeveral top orthopedists met last week in Seattle to come up with a recommendations for how Major League Baseball should proceed, among them Dr. James Andrews, New York Yankees team physician Dr. Christopher Ahmad, Los Angeles Dodgers head team physician Dr. Neal ElAttrache and Dr. Bert Mandelbaum, an orthopedist based in Santa Monica, California, who was tasked by MLB to head the project. The doctors developed a series of bullet points and consensus statements that were forwarded to baseball Commissioner Bud Selig, who plans an announcement later this month.\n\nBinford, throwing consistently in the low 90s during a 1-2-3 inning in the Futures game, still remembers the warm reception he received at Andrews\u2019 office in Birmingham, Alabama.", "article_metadata": {"description": "For some, Tommy John surgery before major leagues", "title": "For some, Tommy John surgery before major leagues", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "For some, Tommy John surgery before major leagues", "title": "For some, Tommy John surgery before major leagues", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/07/13/for_some_tommy_john_surgery_before_major_leagues/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/07/all-star-futures-game-baseball.jpeg1-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "For some, Tommy John surgery before major leagues", "title": "For some, Tommy John surgery before major leagues", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/07/all-star-futures-game-baseball.jpeg1-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Ronald Blum", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdafb6\"", "article_summary": "So I had an MRI, and it was completely torn.\u201dJust 16 at the time, Binford joined the list of Tommy John surgery alumni.\nNew York Yankees star Masahiro Tanaka has a partially torn ulnar collateral ligament and may need the procedure.\nUp to the plate walked some stud on the other team who was good enough to attract 10-20 scouts.\nElbow ligament-replacement surgery isn\u2019t just for big leaguers these days.\nI was just trying to throw as hard as I could, and I didn\u2019t know any better."}
