SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. — The Rockies’ roster shuffle began Saturday morning, with nine players being shipped to minor-league camp.

Right-handed pitcher Jorge Rondon and outfielder/infielder Rosell Herrera, both on the 40-man roster, were optioned.

The players reassigned to the minors were: right-handed pitchers Justin Miller, Jose Ortega and Gus Schlosser; left-handed pitchers Buddy Boshers, Yohan Flande and Jason Gurka; and catcher Tommy Murphy.

Though the Rockies have been building up Schlosser’s innings as if he might be a starter, manager Walt Weiss said the club has decided to use him as a reliever. Flande will also be used as a reliever.

Weiss said the moves will allow the players to get more time on the diamond.
