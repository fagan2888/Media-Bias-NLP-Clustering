But because I believe the author and I share a determination to prevent an amnesty of millions of illegal immigrants from taking place, I will attempt in the following passages merely to point out where I think my piece was misunderstood.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nIn my very short USA Today op-ed \u2013 which was originally accepted for publication months ago \u2013 I made the point that politicians often change their minds, and I argued that there is nothing inherently wrong with changing one\u2019s mind or policy positions if they are changing to the right position and if the change is sincere. As the leader of a grassroots organization that aims to build a broad coalition and which recognizes that the growth and success of any political movement necessitates a welcoming attitude toward those who once held views in opposition, but who now have adjusted those views, I stand by those statements.\n\nThe Breitbart News piece focuses on just one example from my op-ed, in which I mentioned that Sen. Marco Rubio appears to have changed his mind on immigration. It is a fact that Sen. Rubio in 2013 was one of the authors of the notorious Senate \u201cGang of 8\u201d amnesty bill, which was a broad amnesty bill that lacked even the most basic border security measures. It is also a fact that Sen. Rubio today says he shares our concerns about granting amnesty to millions of people without first addressing border security. These two facts indicate a \u201cflip-flop,\u201d and recognition on his part that the bill he originally championed was severely flawed.\n\nWhat Breitbart News fails to mention is that after I used this example of a flip-flop, I made it very clear that we were still skeptical of Sen. Rubio\u2019s position.\n\nDid Scott Walker and Rubio \u201cflip-flop\u201d? Or did their thinking on these issues merely change, as they spent more time learning about the issues in question, and had more conversations with thoughtful advisers and \u2014 dare we say it \u2014 regular American citizens?\n\nWe honestly don\u2019t know. We do know we\u2019ll be watching them closely, as we\u2019ll watch the other candidates seeking to earn our support.\n\nAfter all, President Reagan had a philosophy of \u201ctrust but verify,\u201d and our position with Sen. Rubio on amnesty is exactly that.\n\nTea Party Patriots was one of the most visible and vocal opponents of Rubio\u2019s 2013 amnesty bill. During the summer of 2013, we created activist toolkits, organized rallies across the country, and orchestrated a massive effort on Capitol Hill to draw attention to the many weaknesses of Sen. Rubio\u2019s \u201cGang of 8\u201d bill. We are proud of that work, and even prouder of the fact that Rubio today appears to have changed his mind on a key aspect of this issue, and appears to be using some of our talking points on border security. That\u2019s progress, plain and simple.\n\nAt Tea Party Patriots, we have a philosophy that guides our grassroots activities: \u201cWhen politicians do the right thing, we stand by them. And when they fail to do the right thing, we hold them accountable.\u201d The Marco Rubio incident is illustrative of that guiding principle. In 2013 we held him accountable with grassroots pressure \u2013 letters to the editor about him, calls into his office, and rallies. And in 2015, as he signals an embrace of our messaging, we welcome it. Why wouldn\u2019t we?\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean he has gained a pass or that we are encouraging conservatives to give Rubio a chance to implement his immigration agenda, as was falsely suggested in the Breitbart News headline.\n\nMarco Rubio\u2019s flip-flop will give many voters cause for concern, as it should, and GOP primary voters will certainly want to examine Rubio\u2019s remarks in light of his previous actions on immigration.\n\nAs the 2016 presidential election heats up, we can expect a lot of flip-flopping from every candidate. When the candidates flip their views to align with ours, we will celebrate those victories and welcome them, to the extent we are satisfied they are sincerely-held changes of opinion.\n\nBreitbart News\u2019 view on this issue seems to be that candidates can never do a course correction or change their positions. That is wrong, of course, and Tea Party Patriots has an impressive track record proving just how often politicians can be persuaded to do the right thing.\n\nI love you, Breitbart News, but this was a cheap shot.\n\nJenny Beth Martin is CEO and Co-Founder of Tea Party Patriots", "article_metadata": {"description": "Tea Party Patriots was one of the most visible and vocal opponents of Rubio\u2019s 2013 amnesty bill.", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Tea Party Patriots was one of the most visible and vocal opponents of Rubio\u2019s 2013 amnesty bill.", "title": "Jenny Beth Martin: In Defense of a 'Changed Mind' - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/08/Rubio-at-Debate-AP-Photo.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/08/11/jenny-beth-martin-in-defense-of-a-changed-mind/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Tea Party Patriots was one of the most visible and vocal opponents of Rubio\u2019s 2013 amnesty bill.", "title": "Jenny Beth Martin: In Defense of a 'Changed Mind' - Breitbart", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/08/Rubio-at-Debate-AP-Photo.jpg", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true", "app_id": 1243316582352556}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": ",2016 Presidential Race, Big Government,amnesty", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "2016 Presidential Race", "published_time": "2015-08-11T14:52:28-07:00", "categories": "Big Government,2016 Presidential Race"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "Jenny Beth Martin is CEO and Co-Founder of Tea Party Patriots\nTea Party Patriots was one of the most visible and vocal opponents of Rubio\u2019s 2013 amnesty bill.\nAfter all, President Reagan had a philosophy of \u201ctrust but verify,\u201d and our position with Sen.
