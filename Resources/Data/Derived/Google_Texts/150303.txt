As Election Day nears, I can only hope that Democrats, for the sake of our country, take an honest look at what their party has become. I believe that President Barack Obama and his administration have repeatedly lied to the American people. According to the Obamacare principle architect, Johnathan Gruber, the “stupidity of the American voter was really critical to passing the legislation.” Why did they have to rely on this type of deception to pass this law? We may be too busy trying to make a living to understand everything that goes on in Washington but we’re not stupid.

Hillary Clinton deleted 30,000 emails that supposedly were personal in nature. Now we find out that some were so “top secret” that they can’t be disclosed. Is she also counting on the “stupidity of the American people” to continue her campaign?

Clinton is being investigated by the FBI for violating laws concerning national security. Her chief of staff walked out of her meeting with the FBI. Another one of her staff members, Bryan Pagliano, asserted his Fifth Amendment right not to appear before a select committee. Why are all these people afraid to speak? What are they hiding?

Obama has added almost $9 trillion to the federal debt. Our children and grandchildren will have to pay for this. The Democratic Party’s solution is to spend more. This is simply unbelievable. For the sake of our country, I can only hope that voters will reject liberal policies that are destroying our country. Finally and most importantly, we as a people need to ask almighty God for forgiveness and direction.
