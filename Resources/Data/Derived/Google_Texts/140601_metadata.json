According to a PI tally of new clients registered with the Senate, November was the worst month of 2013 for new client business. What\u2019s more, December is on pace to be even weaker. According to the LDA database, 137 new clients were registered in November \u2014 the lowest total all year. And with December almost half over, only 46 new clients have filed new registrations. PI is not expecting a flurry of registrations around the holidays either. For comparison\u2019s sake, the best month of 2013 for new business was April, when 581 new registrations were filed. When December 2013 is compared with December last year, the outlook improves a bit. Lobbying shops are working at adding new business at essentially the same clip. There were 48 registrations through Dec. 12 in 2012. November 2012 was even worse than November 2013 \u2014 with only 39 new clients total. Here is our quarterly compilation of new business with numbers as of Thursday: http://bit.ly/1e7WCgt\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nDC POLICY GROUP INKS TWO: The new firm started by Julie Bauer, formerly of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority and Chicago Board of Trade, has inked her former employers as clients.

Rob Portman\u2019s office.\n\nWALL STREET\u2019S POLITICAL WILDERNESS YEARS: Ben White and Maggie Haberman : \u201cAt both ends of the political spectrum, the titans of American finance today find themselves alienated from politics to a surprising degree. On the left, the rift has been precipitated by populist outrage and a damaged, difficult relationship with the White House. The discord and disappointment has simmered for years and is now boiling toward the surface on both sides, particularly for donors who felt burned and spurned by a White House they helped to elect. To understand just how far apart the president and the barons of Wall Street have drifted, consider that as a young senator in his first run for the presidency, Barack Obama took in $16 million from Wall Street donors while last year, as the incumbent president, he was able to muster only $6 million.\u201d\n\nSALAZAR, BILLIONAIRE FORM CONSERVATION PAC: Via POLITICO\u2019s Morning Energy: Former Interior Secretary Ken Salazar and hedge fund billionaire Louis Bacon will launch a bipartisan PAC \u2014 America's Conservation PAC \u2014 which will push conservation and wildlife issues and make direct contributions to congressional candidates. The PAC will tap into those who feel Washington, and specifically Congress \u2014 which in its 112th iteration, from 2011 to 2012, didn\u2019t conserve any new land via wilderness designation, national monuments or otherwise \u2014 haven\u2019t done enough on conservation issues. Bacon has long worked to privately conserve land through easements \u2014 for example, earlier this year he put 21,000 acres of a ranch into an easement, and in 2012, Bacon gave 77,000 acres to the Fish and Wildlife Service for conservation. Salazar and Bacon will hold a conference call at 11 a.m.\n\nELSEWHERE IN THE INFLUENCE WORD:\n\nWHAT DO PACS WANT? OpenSecrets.org finds that corporate and trade association PACs are some of the most cautious actors in all of politics \u2014 and that they sink money into candidates already likely to win, not into contested, competitive races. http://bit.ly/19EtVQz\n\nCLICK THIS: It\u2019s about how campaigns get you to open their emails and give them money. http://huff.to/1bytTcO\n\nBONJEAN X-MAS PARTY TEASER: The Hill reports on the possible celebrity guest at the annual bash thrown by Ron and Sara Bonjean. http://bit.ly/18WYKFK\n\nLIGHTER CLICK: Missouri teen channels Playbook (and PI!) http://politi.co/1jSHGmg\n\nNEW POLITICAL ACTION COMMITTEE REGISTRATIONS:\n\nYellow Dog of New Orleans, La. \u2014 Treasurer Meghan Smith\n\nNEW LOBBYING REGISTRATIONS: (Firm: Client)\n\nBecker & Poliakoff: Signal Above\n\nD.C.

More than a storefront, or a website. It\u2019s working together as a community, creating the things people want, today. It\u2019s the smile at the end of every transaction and the effort and innovation that customers don\u2019t see. Retail businesses \u2013 98% of which are small businesses \u2013 are at the heart of many towns and neighborhoods nationwide. That\u2019s why when retail thrives, communities thrive.
