Turns out they\u2019re secret for a very good reason.\n\n[T]he agreement [between the UN and Iran] diverges from normal inspection procedures between the IAEA and a member country by essentially ceding the agency\u2019s investigative authority to Iran. It allows Tehran to employ its own experts and equipment [at Parchin] in the search for evidence for activities that it has consistently denied \u2014 trying to develop nuclear weapons\u2026 The document suggests that instead of carrying out their own probe, IAEA staff will be reduced to monitoring Iranian personnel as these inspect the Parchin site\u2026 That wording suggests that \u2014 beyond being barred from physically visiting the site \u2014 the agency won\u2019t even get photo or video information from areas Iran says are off-limits because they have military significance. IAEA experts would normally take environmental samples for evidence of any weapons development work, but the agreement stipulates that Iranian technicians will do the sampling. The sampling is also limited to only seven samples inside the building where the experiments allegedly took place. Additional ones will be allowed only outside of the Parchin site, in an area still to be determined.\n\nSo that\u2019s why the White House\u2019s agreement with Iran was conspicuously silent about Parchin. Turns out there was a complete cave to Iran on that already in the works courtesy of Iran\u2019s side deal with the UN. If you\u2019re wondering how often a country suspected of covertly working on a bomb is allowed to report on its own facilities, without the IAEA conducting independent inspections, former UN inspector OIli Heinonen told the AP he\u2019d never heard of such a thing in all his time at the agency. This capitulation, essentially putting Iran on the honor system, is totally unprecedented. Heinonen, incidentally, is also the guy who raised alarms last month when it came out that Iran\u2019s deal with the U.S. would give them 24 days potentially to clean up a site where secret nuclear work is suspected before the UN is allowed entry. That\u2019s more than enough time to cover your tracks, said Heinonen, if the site is small, as is likely to be the case with Iran\u2019s attempts at cheating. In other words, we have one of the world\u2019s foremost experts on nuclear weapons programs telling western media that the enforcement provisions of the deal are a sham.\n\nAnd Congress knows all about this \u2014 I think. Remember this clip from Kerry\u2019s testimony before the Senate last month? Jim Risch mentioned at one point in questioning Kerry that he couldn\u2019t believe the UN would be forced to rely on soil samples provided by Iran instead of gathering its own samples to test for traces of uranium. Bob Menendez was taken aback by that; could that possibly be true, he asked? At that point, Kerry told Menendez that he couldn\u2019t talk about it publicly but that his questions would be answered in a classified briefing. Bob Corker then chimed in to say that he\u2019d already had the briefing and that Kerry was right that it would answer Menendez\u2019s question. And now here\u2019s the AP confirming that not only will the UN have to make do with samples provided by the accused cheaters themselves, it\u2019ll have to submit to Iran\u2019s authority over various other aspects of inspections. Which raises the question: Why is this a secret? I could understand keeping it under wraps if the secret side deal amounted to a huge capitulation by Iran; in that case, you\u2019d want to keep it out of the media so that Iran\u2019s hardest fanatics don\u2019t revolt against the deal as a national humiliation. But in reality, the side deal is a huge capitulation to Iran. What reason is there to keep it classified except to spare Obama and his European partners some enormous political difficulty in selling this deal to the suckers in their electorates?\n\nThe only non-political explanation I can come up with is that the west didn\u2019t want other countries to know that Iran got such a sweetheart deal or else other rogue regimes with their eyes on nuclear weapons will demand the same sham inspection policy. That\u2019s the state of Smart Power circa 2015: Keep the current capitulations a secret to reduce the need for future capitulations.
