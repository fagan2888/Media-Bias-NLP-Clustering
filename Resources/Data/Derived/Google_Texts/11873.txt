SOUTH BEND, Ind. (AP) - The former chairman and chief executive officer of Gap Inc. and his wife have donated $5 million to Note Dame to endow the men’s basketball head coaching position.

The university said the money from Glenn and Stacey Murphy of Toronto will help underwrite the salary of Mike Brey, in his 16th year at the school, provide stability and resources for the long term and create funds for use within the department.

Glenn Murphy, who led Gap Inc. from 2007 through 2014, grew up in Canada and describes himself as a rabid Notre Dame fan.

Other coaching positions endowed at Notre Dame are the head football coach ($10 million), the women’s head basketball coach ($5 million); the men’s lacrosse coach ($3 million) and the football defensive back’s coach ($3 million).
