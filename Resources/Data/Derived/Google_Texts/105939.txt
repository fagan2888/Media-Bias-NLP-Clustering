Even after losing the NBA Finals in five games, the Miami Heat are still 7-2 favorites to win the 2015 NBA Championship, according to online sportsbook Bovada.lv. But now rumors are swirling that the Heat may try to turn their Big Three into a Big Four by adding Knicks star forward Carmelo Anthony, a likely free agent. Then again, just as Anthony can opt out and leave the Knicks, Miami star LeBron James can do the same with the Heat this summer.

So, the Count wondered, how would the betting odds shift if either of these stars sought greener pastures this summer? The greenest pasture, according to Bovada sports book manager Kevin Bradley, might be in Chicago.

The Bulls, current 10-1 favorites to win the title, would drop to 2-1 if James opted out and signed with them. Their odds would only shrink to 5-1 with Anthony.

Overall, the second shortest odds are if Anthony joins the Heat at 5-2. And if James decided to return to his hometown Cleveland Cavaliers—the team that drafted him, and he left after the 2010 season—they'd have 3-1 odds with James, Kyrie Irving, and the No. 1 pick in this year's NBA Draft. The Cavaliers' odds improve more than any, shortening from 33-1 longshots.

All of Anthony's potential suitors would also see an improvement in their odds if they sign the seven-time All-Star forward, but the odds improve significantly in most cases if the team signed James instead of Anthony, however unrealistic.

For the same reason, the Heat stand the most to lose: Without James, their odds would drop to 25-1. The Knicks, without Anthony, would slip to 70-1 but even with him are 40-1 underdogs.
