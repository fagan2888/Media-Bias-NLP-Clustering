Brought to power by pro-Western street protests known as the Orange Revolution, her time in office was marked by bitter infighting involving her erstwhile Orange ally Viktor Yushchenko who had become president.\n\nWearing a peasant-style hair braid that became her trademark and with strong organizational powers, Tymoshenko, a fiery public speaker, became a force in Ukrainian politics. But she was dogged by involvement in gas deals in the 1990s from which she made a fortune and which gave her the nickname of \"gas princess\". Seen by many as divisive and too sharp of tongue, she can inspire loathing as well as loyalty among Ukrainians.\n\nTymoshenko was convicted and jailed for 2-1/2 years under Yanukovich for abuse of office, walking free only in February when her nemesis fled to Russia. But with the dynamics of the political establishment drastically changed by the Maidan revolution, she has failed to re-kindleher old strong support.\n\nSurveys put her in a distant second place.\n\nSerhiy Tigipko (54)\n\nTigipko is a banker and parliamentary deputy who has served in several governments, once as economy minister, and was at one time close to the ousted Yanukovich, serving as his campaign director for a short while in late 2004.\n\nSeen as the third-placed candidate in opinion polls, Tigipko, whose main voting base is in the Russian-speaking east, is highly critical of Kiev's interim authorities for the way they have handled separatist rebellions there.\n\nHe says Kiev has not done enough to build bridges with people in the east or addressed legitimate grievances, particularly over Russian language rights, thereby opening up a space for the pro-Moscow separatists.\n\nMykhailo Dobkin (44)\n\nDobkin, a businessman and former governor of the eastern city and region of Kharkiv, is the official candidate of the Party of Regions, once Ukraine's ruling party led by Yanukovich.\n\nHe fiercely criticized the pro-Europe street protests in Kiev and has questioned the legitimacy ofUkraine's interim government, but the expected disruption of Sunday's election in the eastern regions is likely to eat into his support.\n\nHis election campaign has been financed by Ukraine's richest man, coal and steel magnate Rinat Akhmetov, who has belatedly condemned the actions of the pro-Russian separatists and called on people in eastern Ukraine to retake control of their cities.\n\nDobkin is on a list of nearly 30 Ukrainians - also including Yanukovich - whose assets have been frozen by Switzerland over their role in the Ukraine crisis.\n\n(Compiled by Gabriela Baczynska and Richard Balmforth; Editing by Gareth Jones and David Evans)\n\nRead the original article on Reuters.
