Inside these vinyl walls near Interstate 25 and Colo. Highway 52, Encana is drilling six wells, according to an employee. The company is using hydraulic fracturing in the drilling process. (Johnnie St. Vrain/Times-Call)

Dear Johnnie: Off Interstate 25 and Colo. Highway 52 (on the west side) is a two-story building. It is surrounded by drilling equipment. It looks like it has no ceiling. What is it, and why would they build something like that? Are they hiding something? -- A Frequent I-25 Traveler

Dear Frequent Traveler: You could say that they are hiding something, but not in the sense your question suggests.

That wall appears to be made of a thick vinyl, held up by I-beams planted in the ground, and is at least 32 feet tall, by my estimation. And within the enclosure is more drilling equipment.

I stopped by the other day to see for myself. It sits on the south side of Weld County Road 16, just west of the interstate.

The north side of the structure has an opening, with a "guard" shack and a sign that says this is an Encana operation.

A worker taking a smoking break as I walked up said that six wells are being fracked behind that wall, which is in place as a sound and light buffer.

You can see other structures like this Weld County. There two of them just north of Colo. Highway 66 near Mead.

I asked the man I spoke with if each hole is going a different direction. No, he said, they all are headed the same direction, so that oil and/or gas can be pulled more quickly from the earth. It's like sticking two straws in your Coke. You can drink twice as fast as when you have only one straw.
