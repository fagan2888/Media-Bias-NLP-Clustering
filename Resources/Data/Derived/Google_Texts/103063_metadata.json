Here\u2019s another statement we all probably agree with: The federal government has all sorts of arrows in its quiver when it comes to gathering intelligence to thwart such attacks. And that is where it begins to gets dicey: Unfortunately, in its counterterrorism project, the government appears to be relying more and more on perhaps the most twisted of those arrows; the use of informants, coerced and/or rewarded, entrapment, and the sting.\n\nSince the September 2001 terrorist attacks on the Twin Towers and the Pentagon, the federal government has obtained more than 500 federal counterterrorism convictions. According to a new Human Rights Watch report (produced in association with Columbia Law School\u2019s Human Rights Institute), \u201cnearly 50 percent of [those] \u2026 convictions resulted from informant-based cases; almost 30 percent of those cases were sting operations in which the informant played an active role in the underlying plot.\u201d\n\nThe report, \u201cIllusion of Justice: Human Rights Abuses in US Terrorism Prosecutions,\u201d points out that, while \u201c[m]any prosecutions have properly targeted individuals engaged in planning or financing terror attacks\u2026 many others have targeted individuals who do not appear to have been involved in terrorist plotting or financing at the time the government began to investigate them.\n\n\u201cIndeed, in some cases the Federal Bureau of Investigation may have created terrorists out of law-abiding individuals by conducting sting operations that facilitated or invented the target\u2019s willingness to act.\u201d\n\nIn addition, there is a good chance that, without the government\u2019s active participation, many of those ensnared by the government did not have the mental or intellectual capacity to plan, finance and/or carry out a terrorist event.\n\n\u201cAmericans have been told that their government is keeping them safe by preventing and prosecuting terrorism inside the US,\u201d said Andrew Prasow, Human Rights Watch\u2019s deputy Washington director, in a statement. \u201cBut take a closer look and you realize that many of these people would never have committed a crime if not for law enforcement encouraging, pressuring, and sometimes paying them to commit terrorist acts.\u201d\n\nAccording to the report, entrapment, or what smells like entrapment, is writ large over several of the cases. However, the report points out that proving entrapment is not an easy task for defendants: \u201cIn theory, the defendants in these cases should be able to avoid criminal liability by making a claim of \u2018entrapment.\u2019 However, US law requires that to prove entrapment a defendant show both that the government induced him to commit the act in question and that he was not \u2018predisposed\u2019 to commit it. This predisposition inquiry focuses attention on the defendant\u2019s background, opinions, beliefs, and reputation \u2014 in other words, not on the crime, but on the nature of the defendant. This character inquiry makes it exceptionally difficult for a defendant to succeed in raising the entrapment defense, particularly in the terrorism context, where inflammatory stereotypes and highly charged characterizations of Islam and foreigners often prevail. Indeed, no claim of entrapment has been successful in a US federal terrorism case to date. European human rights law\u2014instructive for interpreting internationally recognized fair trial rights \u2014 suggests that the current formulation of the US defense of entrapment may not comport with fair trial standards.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "A damning new report suggests the bureau facilitates and sometimes even invents its targets' willingness to act", "author": "Bill Berkowitz", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "A damning new report suggests the bureau facilitates and sometimes even invents its targets' willingness to act", "title": "How the FBI is creating terrorists", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/08/03/how_the_fbi_is_creating_terrorists_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/07/terror_arrest_FBI.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A damning new report suggests the bureau facilitates and sometimes even invents its targets' willingness to act", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/07/terror_arrest_FBI.jpg", "title": "How the FBI is creating terrorists", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "How the FBI is creating terrorists", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, 9/11, AlterNet, FBI, Pentagon, Terrorism", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe05c6\"", "article_summary": "Indeed, no claim of entrapment has been successful in a US federal terrorism case to date.\nSince the September 2001 terrorist attacks on the Twin Towers and the Pentagon, the federal government has obtained more than 500 federal counterterrorism convictions.\nEuropean human rights law\u2014instructive for interpreting internationally recognized fair trial rights \u2014 suggests that the current formulation of the US defense of entrapment may not comport with fair trial standards.\u201d\n\u201cAmericans have been told that their government is keeping them safe by preventing and prosecuting terrorism inside the US,\u201d said Andrew Prasow, Human Rights Watch\u2019s deputy Washington director, in a statement.\nHere\u2019s another statement we all probably agree with: The federal government has all sorts of arrows in its quiver when it comes to gathering intelligence to thwart such attacks."}
