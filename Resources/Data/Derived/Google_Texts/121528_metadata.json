Rounding out the top three responses was healthcare, which 17 percent labeled as the most important issue. Immigration was second to last with three percent, only slightly above \"war/fears of war, lack of respect for each other, and the gap between the rich and the poor,\" which all garnered two percent of responses.\n\nImmigration has not ranked in the top five of responses all year, as Americans have shown that they are primarily concerned with the economy and healthcare.\n\nRepublicans should take these polls into mind when strategizing for 2014 and beyond. It's obvious what Americans are not happy about: healthcare and the economy. By presenting clear plans to fix both of these issues, the GOP could make gains in coming elections. Issues like the wage gap and immigration, while trendy among the current administration, simply are just not that important to the average American.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The most important issue is \"dissatisfaction with government.\" .05/25/2016 14:44:48PM EST.", "author": "Christine Rousselle", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "The most important issue is \"dissatisfaction with government.\"", "title": "Christine Rousselle - Poll: Only Three Percent of Americans Consider Immigration \"Most Important\" Problem", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/christinerousselle/2013/12/13/poll-only-three-percent-of-americans-consider-immigration-most-important-issue-n1762409", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2011/275/168cbf81-7335-4c2d-b5c1-9d0316b866a8@news.ap.org.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "The most important issue is \"dissatisfaction with government.\"", "title": "Christine Rousselle - Poll: Only Three Percent of Americans Consider Immigration \"Most Important\" Problem", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/christinerousselle/2013/12/13/poll-only-three-percent-of-americans-consider-immigration-most-important-issue-n1762409", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2011/275/168cbf81-7335-4c2d-b5c1-9d0316b866a8@news.ap.org.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Poll: Only Three Percent of Americans Consider Immigration \"Most Important\" Problem, Christine Rousselle, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "_id": "\"57477afa6914bd0286fe5db2\"", "article_summary": "Twenty one percent of respondents said that the most important problem facing the United States was dissatisfaction with government, while 19 percent said the economy in general was the most important problem.\nIssues like the wage gap and immigration, while trendy among the current administration, simply are just not that important to the average American.\nImmigration has not ranked in the top five of responses all year, as Americans have shown that they are primarily concerned with the economy and healthcare.\nRounding out the top three responses was healthcare, which 17 percent labeled as the most important issue.\nIt's obvious what Americans are not happy about: healthcare and the economy."}
