Sonnad Emerging Leader in Managed Care Research Award. The award will honor the journal\u2019s longtime associate editor, who died of a cardiac arrhythmia she suffered while running an ultramarathon May 27, 2015, in Washington State.\n\nSeema S. Sonnad, PhD, 52, was the co-director of the Value Institute at Christiana Care Health System of Wilmington, Delaware, which offered her the opportunity to apply her wealth of knowledge of healthcare systems to real-world settings. Her varied, multi-disciplinary career had focused on the evaluation of medical services, but her personal interests had always involved teaching and mentoring up-and-coming leaders in the field, especially young women.\n\nFor more than a year, Dr. Sonnad had been among the members of the AJMC editorial board advocating for a program to recognize emerging leaders in the field of managed care. She had been scheduled to take part in the selection of the first finalists and, ultimately, the winner. Three finalists will be invited to a celebration of 20 years of The American Journal of Managed Care, to be held October 28, 2015, in Orlando, Florida.\n\n\u201cSeema was one of the people who made our Emerging Leader program happen, so it is appropriate to name the award in her honor,\u201d said Michael E. Chernew, PhD, co-editor in chief of the journal. \u201cSeema was a highly sought after and spectacular mentor,\u201d said A. Mark Fendrick, MD, co-editor in chief. \u201cThis honor recognizes her enthusiasm for nurturing the careers of young researchers from a number of disciplines.\u201d\n\nAbout the Award\n\nThe Seema S. Sonnad Emerging Leader in Managed Care Research Award will recognize an individual whose early achievements in managed care demonstrate the potential for making an exceptional long-term contribution as a leader in the field. The award includes complimentary attendance at that event (including registration, travel / accommodation, and relevant expenses to be paid for the length of participation in the meeting) for three finalists.\n\nAward nominees must meet the following requirements:\n\n\n\nBe less than five years from the receipt of their highest degree / less than seven years from their first full-time position.\n\nWhile not a requirement, the publication or acceptance of a paper in The American Journal of Managed Care will be positively noted.\n\nNominations: The nomination package should consist of a letter of recommendation outlining the nominee\u2019s contributions and deservingness (not to exceed 2 pages), CV, and AJMC publication (if applicable). Self-nominations are permitted.\n\nPlease submit all nominations to: info(at)ajmc(dot)com by July 1, 2015.\n\nAbout the Journals\n\nThe American Journal of Managed Care celebrates its 20th year in 2015 as the leading peer-reviewed journal dedicated to issues in managed care.
