QuikTrip this month closed on the purchase of land at 3200 Southeast Blvd. for what will be its fifth next-generation store in Wichita.

QuikTrip West Inc. purchased the property near E. 31st Street South from K&R RV Park LLC on Jan. 10, according to real estate transactions published today in the Wichita Business Journal.

No purchase price was released.

The so called “Gen-3” store, on which construction is expected to begin later next month or early in March, will join others on Broadway just south of Kellogg, Hillside just south of Kellogg, Harry and Webb, and one opening next month at Meridian and MacArthur, according to Mike Thornbrugh, spokesman for the Tulsa-based company.

The company doesn’t release development costs for the stores, but building permits for a couple recent Gen-3 stores have placed construction values between $520,000 and $578,000.

“Over a matter of time, where you can build the new-style store, we’ll do so,” Thornbrugh says.

Some stores may not have the space for the larger format, but the company is incorporating many of the Gen-3 features in those where it can, he says.

“We’re not changing who we are, we’re adding to it,” he says, including fresh-food options and full-service counters for hot and cold specialty drinks.
