Ted Cruz hasn't been widely known for his instant ability to warm hearts, at least not among his colleagues on Capitol Hill.\n\nBut his game plan at a rally in downtown Janesville on Thursday was to sway the hearts\u2014or at least connect with the gut\u2014of a core of local voters here. It's their blue-collar mentality that could make a big difference as he tries to get a leg up on rival presidential candidate Donald Trump in the political battleground state of Wisconsin.\n\nCruz appeared Thursday afternoon at the Armory, an event venue in downtown Janesville, speaking for about a half hour at a public rally at the former military armory's training gym-turned theater.\n\nCruz spoke of his desire to win the Republican nomination for president and then the White House in the November election. He spoke of his overarching presidential goals: to repeal Obamacare, instill a flat tax for all residents, secure U.S. borders and end \u201csanctuary cities\u201d and \u201cwelfare\u201d for illegal immigrants in the U.S.\n\nCruz sought to funnel those talking points into a message aimed squarely at the heartwood aesthetic of the 300 mostly middle-class, blue-jean jacket and tennis shoe-clad residents who filled the Armory's theater room to capacity Thursday.\n\nHe told the rally attendants that his tax, immigration and national defense policies would help to boost the national economy, rally job markets, and lift stagnated middle class worker wages\u2014but he said he needs their faith in him and their votes to make it happen.\n\n\u201cWe'll see morning in America,\u201d Cruz said in his rally speech Thursday.\n\nThe eyes of national network television cameras were on Cruz Thursday. But more crucial, perhaps, were the eyes of local, middle class voters such as nurse Peggy Kures, a Janesville native.\n\nKures has been on the fence over whom to vote for in the presidential election. She teeter-tottered her hand in front of her face to illustrate her thoughts.\n\n\u201cI'm back and forth (between Cruz and Donald Trump), but lately I've leaning toward Cruz,\u201d Cures said. \u201cI admire his policies and his ideals. He follows the constitution.\u201d\n\nJanesville resident John Gorski, a Vietnam Veteran, said Thursday he's still undecided whom he'll to vote for.\n\n\u201cI wanted to come here to learn more about what Ted Cruz says he'd do. I don't know a lot, yet, but I know a lot of people would rather see a Republican president than the alternative, Hillary,\u201d Gorski said.\n\nGorski said he's not a big fan of Trump, who he said has a \u201cdevil-may-care attitude,\u201d and \u201ca rude, New York style.\u201d By contrast, Gorski said he thinks Cruz has \u201cgood values in a patriotic way\u201d and \u201ccredibility.\u201d\n\nGorski and Kures represent a segment of primary voters both Cruz and Trump hope to pin down in the coming weeks.\n\nThe Wisconsin Republican presidential primary is the first in of a wave of primaries in seven states throughout April. That comes at a time when Cruz trails Trump in overall primary wins, although Cruz claimed Thursday that polls show he holds a slim lead over Trump among Wisconsin voters.\n\n\u201cYou are going to be a bellwether for the rest of the nation April 5,\u201d Cruz's wife, Heidi Cruz, said during a speech at the rally.\n\nTrump's campaign announced Thursday that Trump will stop in Janesville on Tuesday for a rally at the Holiday Inn Express conference center on the east side.\n\nPolitical analysts say Wisconsin is a major swing state in the GOP presidential primary, and it's being looked at as a hotbed for key Congressional seats as Republicans and Democrats fight for the balance of control of the White House, Congress, and a politically teetering U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nEven if Cruz has a slight edge over Trump in Wisconsin, a significant portion of Republican voters are undecided whom they'd vote for for president.\n\nWade Hallett, the Rock County Republican Party's elections board chairman, acknowledged that Thursday, and suggested it may be an even bigger factor in Janesville than the rest of Wisconsin.\n\n\u201cJanesville and Rock County tends to be a little bit more centrist than maybe other places in the state,\u201d he said. \u201cWisconsin is a political swing state right now for sure, and Janesville is a real swing town.\u201d\n\nFor Cruz and Trump both, timing of appearances and singular impressions with local voting bases could be paramount.\n\nGorski highlighted that point as he shot video of Cruz's rally with a digital camcorder.\n\n\u201cIf this guy is the next president, who knows? This could be my only chance to see him.\u201d\n\nCruz, the son of an expatriate Cuban freedom fighter, fired sharp shots aimed at Islamic terrorism as a global and domestic threat. He told those at the rally that he wants to see U.S. military and defense policies that would strike hard and fast to overwhelm Islamic terrorist groups.\n\nHe claimed that would be a more effectual response than Obama's defense policies and what he called historically \u201cslow-to-anger\u201d American defense strategies.\n\n\u201cIf you are going to wage jihad against America, we are coming to kill you,\u201d Cruz said to a burst of applause.\n\nKures said Cruz's tough talk on terrorism Thursday earned her support.\n\n\u201cHe's got it. He's go my vote,\u201d she said.\n\nNot so convinced was Rob Sooter of Janesville.\n\nHe stood outside the Armory waving a white picket sign as people were leaving the Cruz rally. His sign read: \u201cLess obnoxious doesn't mean less evil. No Trump, No Cruz.\u201d\n\nSooter said he doesn't trust Cruz, in part because of one of Cruz's emerging ideas: \u201cpatrolling and securing\u201d so-called Muslim neighborhoods.\n\n\u201cTed Cruz, unlike Trump, speaks with some civility. Too bad his message is dangerous. Openly advocating for selective patrolling of neighborhoods to focus on one group, Muslims? That's a bigoted police state,\u201d Sooter said.\n\nSooter's picketing drew arguments with a few people leaving the rally. One man yelled at Sooter to \u201cgo back to Russia.\u201d\n\nSooter looked at the falling snow Thursday afternoon as it collected on his sign and the lapels of his black trench coat.\n\n\u201cWait,\u201d he said. \u201cIsn't the Cold War over?\u201d", "article_metadata": {"Description": "Republican Presidential candidate Ted Cruz sought to gain middle-class support at a rally in Janesville, a major swing voter town in battleground Wisconsin, which he's vying to take in the April primary against rival candidate Donald Trump.", "author": "Neil Johnson", "og": {"image": {"width": 1000, "identifier": "http://www.gazettextra.com/storyimage/JG/20160324/ARTICLES/160329816/EP/1/2/EP-160329816.jpg", "height": 667}, "type": "article", "description": "Republican Presidential candidate Ted Cruz sought to gain middle-class support at a rally in Janesville, a major swing voter town in battleground Wisconsin, which he's vying to take in the April primary against rival candidate Donald Trump.", "title": "Cruz rallies Janesville voters in Wisconsin's 'swing town'"}, "twitter": {"description": "Republican Presidential candidate Ted Cruz sought to gain middle-class support at a rally in Janesville, a major swing voter town in battleground Wisconsin, which he's vying to take in the April primary against rival candidate Donald Trump.", "title": "Cruz rallies Janesville voters in Wisconsin's 'swing town'", "url": "http://www.gazettextra.com/20160324/cruz_rallies_janesville_voters_in_wisconsins_swing_town", "image": "http://www.gazettextra.com/storyimage/JG/20160324/ARTICLES/160329816/EP/1/1/EP-160329816.jpg", "site": "@gazettextra", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"admins": 184800176}, "article": {"published_time": 20160324215043}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "Cruz rallies Janesville voters in Wisconsin's 'swing town'Anthony Wahl John Gorski takes video during a rally for Republican presidential candidate U.S.\nThe Wisconsin Republican presidential primary is the first in of a wave of primaries in seven states throughout April.\nHe stood outside the Armory waving a white picket sign as people were leaving the Cruz rally.\nThat comes at a time when Cruz trails Trump in overall primary wins, although Cruz claimed Thursday that polls show he holds a slim lead over Trump among Wisconsin voters.\nEven if Cruz has a slight edge over Trump in Wisconsin, a significant portion of Republican voters are undecided whom they'd vote for for president."}
