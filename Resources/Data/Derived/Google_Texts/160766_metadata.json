With the bill\u2019s passage, Florida joins twenty-nine other states with laws that criminalize the deliberate harm or murder of an unborn child.\n\nPreviously, Florida\u2019s statute of limitations reserved criminal charges until a child reached viability outside of the womb, usually between 18 and 22 weeks.\n\nNow any deliberate wrongful harm that comes to an unborn child throughout the entirety of pregnancy is punishable as a criminal offense.\n\n\u201cThere is no timeline anymore for justice for an unborn child of a pregnant woman,\u201d explained the bill\u2019s sponsor, State Rep. Larry Ahern, R\u2013Fl. Abortion advocates remain unconvinced.\n\nAmanda Allen of the Center for Reproductive Rights characterized the bill to RH Reality Check as \u201ca cynical attempt for proponents to claim they care about the health of pregnant women.\u201d Allen\u2019s chief critique comes from the bill\u2019s potential to \u201craise the specter of personhood into the law.\u201d\n\nCarrie Eisnaugle, the President of Florida Right to Life, described the law as a measure to protect women\u2019s rights by providing legal recourse under state law for the wrongful injury of unborn children.\n\nIn an interview with Daily Signal she explained that \u201cany other woman in Renee\u2019s situation now has the ability to seek justice on behalf of her unborn child.\u201d\n\nRenee Lee\u2019s tragedy provided the impetus for the law. Lee, a young woman dealing with an unexpected pregnancy, was duped into taking the abortifacient drug, Misoprostol, by her boyfriend, John Welden. Immediately Welden faced conviction, not for murder, but for \u201ctampering with a consumer product.\u201d\n\nAt the passage of the law, an emotional Lee told Reuters, when you \u201c[want] that baby and someone violently takes it from you \u2013 it needs to be a crime.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Florida Governor Rick Scott signed H.B. 59, the \u201cUnborn Victims of Violence Act,\u201d into law last week.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Florida Governor Rick Scott signed H.B. 59, the \u201cUnborn Victims of Violence Act,\u201d into law last week.", "title": "Florida Moves to Protect Unborn Children", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/140626_Unborn_Wegmann.jpg", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1yVjEyL"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Florida Governor Rick Scott signed H.B. 59, the \u201cUnborn Victims of Violence Act,\u201d into law last week.", "title": "Florida Moves to Protect Unborn Children", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/140626_Unborn_Wegmann.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Society", "tag": "Protecting Life", "published_time": "2014-06-27T16:54:43+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "rick scott, unborn victims of violence act,"}, "article_summary": "With the bill\u2019s passage, Florida joins twenty-nine other states with laws that criminalize the deliberate harm or murder of an unborn child.\nNow any deliberate wrongful harm that comes to an unborn child throughout the entirety of pregnancy is punishable as a criminal offense.\n\u201cThere is no timeline anymore for justice for an unborn child of a pregnant woman,\u201d explained the bill\u2019s sponsor, State Rep.
