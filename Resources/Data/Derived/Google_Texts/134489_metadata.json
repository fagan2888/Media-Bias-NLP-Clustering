But it doesn\u2019t mean that same-sex spouses who marry here necessarily will qualify for dependent health insurance benefits.\n\nPrivate sector employers with self-funded plans still can decide whether they want to extend health insurance benefits to same-sex spouses, said Alison Howard, a health care attorney with Crowe & Dunlevy law firm.\n\nTraditionally, those workers are covered under the federal Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), which has no requirement to cover any spouse, Howard said.\n\n\u201cAn employer can do what they want,\u201c she said. \u201cWhat governs is the plan document, and employers need to amend those documents as they wish.\u201d\n\nFor its part, Schnake Turnbo Frank public relations firm \u201cis happy to extend the benefit,\u201d president and chief operating officer Russ Florence said on Monday.\n\n\u201cWe encourage employers across Oklahoma to embrace it,\u201d said Florence. \u201cWe think it\u2019s the right thing to do.\u201d\n\nInsurance changes\n\nMeanwhile, Tami Marr-Crum and fellow independent insurance agents in Oklahoma City believe Monday\u2019s ruling will open up benefits to unmarried same-sex dependent partners on individual policies.\n\n\u201cHeterosexuals currently can sign an affidavit representing themselves as unmarried partners by presenting joint checking accounts or tax returns,\u201d Marr-Crum said.\n\n\u201cWe think it will be the same for unmarried, same-sex partners.\u201d\n\nThe Affordable Care Act requires coverage on the same terms and conditions be extended to same-sex spouses that is offered to opposite-sex spouses. Consequently, Edmond-based Group & Pension Planners LLC sent out a notice allowing the coverage, effective May 1.\n\n\u201cMany employers have already added the provision for same-sex coverage this year,\u201d principal Wayne Pettigrew said. \u201cAlthough it affects only a few employees, many of the employees affected have been with their companies for long periods of time and generally the employers have felt that it was crucial to keeping them in their employment.\u201d\n\n\u201cOther CEOs have commented that they felt that this option was coming anyway and that they did not intend to go out of their way to curtail the option for coverage,\u201d Pettigrew said.\n\nLegal marriage provides rights\n\nHoward said same-sex couples legally married in Oklahoma or elsewhere now may file joint income tax returns, are covered by qualified retirement plan distribution options and consent rules, are eligible for tax-free reimbursement of qualified expenses from health and dependent care flexible spending accounts, are subject to health savings account annual contribution limits for married couples and, if they work for a company that employs 50 or more, may qualify for rights under FMLA (the Family and Medical Leave Act) and continuation health insurance coverage under COBRA (the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act).\n\nIntegris Health\u2019s health plan currently recognizes spouses \u201cas defined under Oklahoma law,\u201d spokeswoman Brooke Cayot said.\n\n\u201cWe are evaluating our enrollment procedures and encouraging employees to call the Integris human resources customer service line with questions,\u201d Cayot said.\n\n\u201cWe are in the process of internally reviewing and adapting, as appropriate, our current polices related to health care decision-making,\u201d she said. \u201cVisitation by same-sex spouses at Integris has been permitted by written policy for several years pursuant to federal law and accreditation standards.\u201d\n\nOU Medical Center spokeswoman Vallery Brown said the hospital didn\u2019t change its policies as a result of the Oklahoma decision. \u201cOU Medical System is a member/leader in LGBT health care equality as of Aug. 1,\u201d she said.\n\nAshley Hudgeons, spokeswoman for Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Oklahoma, said the insurer is in the process of reviewing Monday\u2019s decision to \u201cdetermine what impact, if any, it may have for our members.\u201d\n\nWorking it out\n\nMeanwhile, kitchen designer Jennifer Miller and health care professional Dena Bleeker of Edmond, who\u2019ve been together since 1995, got their marriage license on Tuesday afternoon and are planning \u201ca big reception, but not a wedding,\u201d Miller said.\n\n\u201cThe Supreme Court\u2019s decision caught me by surprise,\u201d Miller said. \u201cWe\u2019d believed the decision would be winter or next summer.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are keeping our own insurance for now,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are wondering about our taxes, and sending out lots of emails to our accountant.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Monday\u2019s Supreme Court decision doesn\u2019t mean that same-sex spouses who marry here necessarily will qualify for dependent health insurance benefits.", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 NewsOK.com.
