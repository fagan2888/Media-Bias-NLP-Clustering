Tom Corbett waited until 2015 to do so. Pennsylvania's Medicaid population now stands around 2.46 million as of March, or more than 19 percent of the state's population.\n\nOf those, more than 256,000 people are newly eligible this year because of the ACA expansion, said Kait Gillis, a spokeswoman for the Pennsylvania Department of Human Services.\n\nThat number figures to grow as newly eligible Pennsylvanians \u2014 the working poor who don't have a particular disability or vulnerable condition, but who make less than 138 percent of the federal poverty threshold \u2014 continue to enroll throughout the year.\n\nThe growth in Medicaid \u2014 and, specifically, Medicaid managed-care programs \u2014 is one of the reasons that the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services proposed the new rules. While some states still offer Medicaid coverage fully administered by the state government, most \u2014 including Pennsylvania \u2014 have outsourced much of the job of health plan maintenance to private companies.\n\nIn Pennsylvania, Gateway, Aetna, UPMC Health Plan and several others offer Medicaid managed-care plans, representing about 80 percent of Pennsylvania's total Medicaid enrollment.\n\nThe proposed regulations, issued Tuesday, represent the first major update to federal Medicaid guidelines since 2002.\n\n\"This is huge. This is going to affect millions of people,\" said Sarah Somers, managing attorney with the National Health Law Program, a health rights and advocacy group for lower income households. \"They want to improve the beneficiary experience.\"\n\nCMS also wants to reduce some of the variation in that experience. While Medicare plans \u2014 federally operated and subsidized health policies for senior citizens \u2014 are more tightly regulated, and more uniform from state to state, Medicaid plans and the benefits included in them vary dramatically.\n\nEven if the benefits packages aren't exactly identical, the new guidelines will bring the plans into closer alignment \"with the private insurance market,\" according to the preamble to the guidelines.\n\nThe changes, still subject to public review and final approval, would create profit guidelines for plans \u2014 85 cents on every dollar collected must be spent on health benefits, or else an insurer's future rate increases might be challenged by state insurance overseers.\n\nMedicaid can be a budget drain for states, but it can be profitable for private companies that run the plans: UnitedHealthcare, Anthem, Aetna and others generated aggregate operating profits of $2.4 billion last year on Medicaid plans, according to data compiled by Mark Farrah Associates of Maine.\n\nThe new rules would also shape standards for provider networks built into the Medicaid plans.\n\nA 2014 report from the U.S. Office of the Inspector General found that a substantial percentage of doctors who are supposed to see Medicaid patients are unable or unavailable to do so.\n\nThat's troubling, because Medicaid enrollees are supposed to select their doctors from a list of providers connected to each Medicaid managed-care plan.\n\n\"Network adequacy, we think that's really, really important,\" said Erin Ninehouser of the Pennsylvania Health Access Network, another advocacy group.\n\nPart of that equation is making sure people have broad access close to home. The network also wants to see beefed-up access guarantees for dependency and mental health counseling, Ninehouser said.\n\nNarrow networks, she said, ought not be so narrow that beneficiaries can't access their physicians and specialists.", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Pennsylvania moves to keep pace with increase in Medicaid", "googlebot": "index", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 The Morning Call", "author": "The Morning Call", "og": {"site_name": "themorningcall.com", "description": "With Medicaid enrollment growing nationally and in Pennsylvania, the federal government is proposing new oversight of privately administered Medicaid plans, tightening profit guidelines for insurers and keeping a closer eye on doctor availability for patients.", "title": "Pennsylvania moves to keep pace with increase in Medicaid", "url": "http://www.mcall.com/news/nationworld/pennsylvania/mc-feds-propose-medicaid-oversight-20150529-story.html", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-556880cc/turbine/mc-feds-propose-medicaid-oversight-20150529", "type": "article"}, "x-servername": "lalvp04.14", "twitter": {"site": "@mcall", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "AAC9C18F70AC386BC4DCF4DDF9BF1786", "robots": "index,follow", "keywords": "Pennsylvania Medicaid increase", "fb": {"admins": 1762506491, "page_id": 73291032902, "app_id": 377275452340817}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=501096172, app-argument=http://www.mcall.com/deeplinkid/83656956", "googlebot-news": "index", "date": "2015-05-29", "Description": "Pennsylvania moves to keep pace with increase in Medicaid", "y_key": "7164478e9f100cbd", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "Pennsylvania Medicaid increase"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fccc0b\"", "article_summary": "\"Network adequacy, we think that's really, really important,\" said Erin Ninehouser of the Pennsylvania Health Access Network, another advocacy group.\nThe proposed regulations, issued Tuesday, represent the first major update to federal Medicaid guidelines since 2002.\nIn Pennsylvania, Gateway, Aetna, UPMC Health Plan and several others offer Medicaid managed-care plans, representing about 80 percent of Pennsylvania's total Medicaid enrollment.\nThe new rules would also shape standards for provider networks built into the Medicaid plans.\nWhile several states expanded their Medicaid programs at the beginning of 2014, Pennsylvania and former Republican Gov."}
