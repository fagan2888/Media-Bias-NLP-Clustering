Denver Police announced Saturday night two people were arrested in connection with a Friday homicide in which a man’s body was found dumped in an alley behind a crowded apartment complex.

Police announced the arrests on Twitter and said no further information would be released until Monday.

The body was found about 1 a.m. Friday near the 1300 block of Xenia Street, police said.

According to officers at the scene, the man’s body was found either in or near a large trash bin. A pool of blood remained as investigators continued to work the scene.

Dozens of apartments overlook the crime scene.

The Denver medical examiner’s office described the man as Asian and said an autopsy has been performed, but the cause and manner of death are being investigated.

The man’s name is being withheld “pending positive identification and next-of-kin notification,” the office said.
