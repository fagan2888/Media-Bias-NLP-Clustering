Adam Schiff Adam SchiffClinton\u2019s email troubles deepen House passes policy bill for intelligence agencies Sunday shows preview: Sanders opens up about battle with Clinton MORE (D-Calif.) says the nation's airports remain vulnerable to terrorism after last week's attacks in Paris.\n\n\u201cIf there was one vulnerability I would say we ought to focus on, it ought to be the airports,\u201d the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee said on MSNBC\u2019s \u201cAndrea Mitchell Reports.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cI still believe that our airport defenses are inadequate,\u201d Schiff continued. \"It still distresses me greatly that when we test the TSA, they largely fail those tests.\"\n\nSchiff also warned of the \"risk of copycat attacks in the United States.\"\n\n\u201cNot likely of the scope in Paris, but nonetheless, people who have been homegrown radicalized here in the United States acting out, lashing out in the wake of these attacks,\u201d he said of the threat.\n\nAbout 130 people died during a series of coordinated bombings and shootings in Paris on Friday. Reports have since emerged that one of the attackers may have infiltrated Europe using a Syrian passport.\n\nSchiff said the incident is no excuse for refusing to accept Syrian refugees in the U.S.\n\n\u201cThe system does work,\u201d he said. \"It has protected us. But look, I understand the fear out there.\n\n\u201cWhat happened in Paris is terrifying,\u201d Schiff continued. \"Safety has to come first.\n\n\"While we want safety first and insist on safety first, we are also a very compassionate people,\u201d he added. \u201cWe don\u2019t turn our backs on mothers and children who are in need and the victims of persecution around the world. It\u2019s part of the proudest tradition of this country.\u201d\n\nThe House is likely voting on legislation later this week that would temporarily halt President Obama\u2019s Syrian refugee resettlement plan.\n\nSkeptics say that the vetting process for potential migrants is not thorough enough to prevent terrorism.\n\nMore than half of the nation\u2019s governors also say they oppose resettling refugees in their states, according to a list compiled Tuesday by The Hill.\n\nObama pushed back against those who want to bar Syrian refugees.\n\n\u201cThe people who are fleeing Syria are the most harmed by terrorism, they are the most vulnerable as a consequence of civil war and strife,\u201d he said Monday during the G-20 Summit in Ankara, Turkey.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Rep.
