JACKSON, Miss. (AP) â€” A study has identified nine rural Mississippi hospitals that are at-risk of closing down.

Hospitals in Covington, Holmes, Tippah, Attala, Adams, Noxubee, Tallahatchie, Pearl River and Copiah counties were identified as running the risk of closure.

Researchers say they arrived at their findings based on the hospitals' profitability, uncompensated care and Medicaid shortfalls. According to the study, reasons for the hospitals' struggles include the national recession that hit in 2008, population loss in rural areas and lack of capital.

The study offers a list of recommendations, including the creation of freestanding emergency departments and the integration of existing services.

The study, "The Economic Impact of Potential Closures of Rural Hospitals in Mississippi," was conducted by university academics and health care and policy professionals.
