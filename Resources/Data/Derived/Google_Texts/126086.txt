(CNN) — A tree limb fell on a tent in the heart of Yosemite National Park early Friday, killing two minors who were sleeping inside, the park said in a statement.

The limb fell around 5 a.m. (8 a.m. ET) and hit the tent in the Upper Pines Campground in Yosemite Valley.

“Park Rangers responded to the campground to provide medical assistance, yet both minors were deceased,” the park said.

Authorities did not release details about the young victims — including their names, ages or where they were visiting from.

“Our thoughts are with the families as they grieve this tragedy,” park Superintendent Don Neubacher said.
