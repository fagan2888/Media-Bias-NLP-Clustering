Statewide, the percentage of nursing homes with the lowest rating rose from 11 percent to 18 percent.\n\n\u2022 The share of the region\u2019s nursing homes with the highest, 5-star rating fell from 17 percent last year to 10 percent this year, a steeper drop than in New York State as a whole. The percent of the state\u2019s nursing homes with the highest rating fell from 25 percent to 20 percent.\n\n\u2022 The average overall rating for Western New York\u2019s nursing homes fell from 3.3 stars to 2.8 stars, placing the region in the middle of the pack among the state\u2019s 10 regions.\n\n\u2022 Locally, the ratings for five nursing homes fell by three stars in the past year, while the ratings for four nursing homes fell by two stars and by one star for 22 other facilities. The ratings for 33 nursing homes did not change, and nine facilities gained a star in their ratings.\n\nThe government made it harder to achieve a 4- or 5-star rating because of growing concern that ratings in past years failed to reflect the quality of care at facilities.\n\n\u201cThis is a terrific step,\u201d said Richard J. Mollott, executive director of the Long Term Care Community Coalition in New York City, a consumer advocacy group.\n\nThe new ratings are more accurate, Mollott said.\n\n\u201cIn the past, it was too easy to get four or five stars,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s still easier than it should be, but definitely better.\u201d\n\nAbout 80 percent of the nearly 16,000 nursing homes in the nation received either a 4- or 5-star rating last year. Only about one-half of nursing homes earned a 4- or 5-star rating in the new ratings.\n\nThe overall rating is based on annual inspection results, staffing levels and performance on 11 quality measures, like the percentage of residents who had urinary tract infections or reported pain.\n\nThe ratings can be found at the Nursing Home Compare, a government website that helps consumers evaluate nursing homes.\n\nFederal officials cautioned that the lower scores \u2013 a result of the new standards \u2013 do not reflect a sudden decline in quality at many homes.\n\nBut nursing home representatives worry that consumers will interpret the lower ratings as a drop in quality rather than a change in the measurements.\n\n\u201cNursing homes improved and reached targeted goals in the old rating system. It\u2019s natural that you would reset the targets,\u201d said Nancy Leiville, senior director of member operational support for the New York State Health Facilities Association, an organization for for-profit nursing homes.\n\nThe new standards were adopted to keep pace with progress made by facilities, she said.\n\n\u201cNursing home quality has improved, and the government just ratcheted up the benchmarks,\u201d Leiville said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "One in five nursing homes in Western New York received the lowest possible score in the latest ratings released by the federal government.Not only did more facilities receive a 1-star rating compared with last year, but the ratings for dozens of others fell by one, two or three stars on th...", "og": {"site_name": "www.buffaloNews.com", "description": "One in five nursing homes in Western New York received the lowest possible score in the latest ratings released by the federal government.Not only did more facilities receive a 1-star rating compared with last year, but the ratings for dozens of others fell by one, two or three stars on th... - The Buffalo News", "title": "Ratings dip at many nursing homes under tougher grading scale, but some meet the challenge  - The Buffalo News", "url": "http://www.buffalonews.com/city-region/medical/ratings-dip-at-many-nursing-homes-under-tougher-grading-scale-but-some-meet-the-challenge-20150301", "image": "http://www.buffalonews.com/storyimage/BN/20150301/CITYANDREGION/150309897/AR/0/AR-150309897.jpg&exactW=1000&exactH=1000&AlignV=middle&Q=80", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@TheBuffaloNews", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"admins": "51000084,100004991951001"}, "__sync_contentCategory": "PayWall", "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd35b4\"", "article_summary": "\u2022 Locally, the ratings for five nursing homes fell by three stars in the past year, while the ratings for four nursing homes fell by two stars and by one star for 22 other facilities.\nThe ratings can be found at the Nursing Home Compare, a government website that helps consumers evaluate nursing homes.\nThe percent of the state\u2019s nursing homes with the highest rating fell from 25 percent to 20 percent.\nThe ratings for 33 nursing homes did not change, and nine facilities gained a star in their ratings.\nOnly about one-half of nursing homes earned a 4- or 5-star rating in the new ratings."}
