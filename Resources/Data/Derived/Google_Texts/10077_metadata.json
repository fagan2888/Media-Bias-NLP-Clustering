He emerged last year in Ukraine\u2019s time of need with the ability and willingness to help the central government in Kiev. The government needed to push back against the Russia-backed rebels who were trying to carve out an autonomous region in the eastern part of the country where it borders on Russia.\n\nRelated: Is John Lennon Back in Putin\u2019s New USSR?\n\nKolomoisky is the founder of Ukraine\u2019s largest bank and head of the Privat Group, a majority owner in multiple oil and steel companies \u2013 and one of the country\u2019s richest men. He was an ardent foe of the separatists and was willing to take on a job not many people wanted: running the heavily Russian-speaking Dnipropetrovsk Oblast.\n\nHe committed to the task with a vengeance, both with his time and his money. The former banker also bankrolled his own army, outfitting at least 2,000 troops with weapons and uniforms and keeping a reported 20,000 men in reserve.\n\nAt first, Kolomoisky and his fighters were more than welcome. As the rebels took over much of Ukraine\u2019s Donbass region, Kolomoisky and his fighters pushed back, fighting side-by-side with government soldiers.\n\nWith most of the fighting stalled because of a tenuous peace deal, the Ukrainian government is now apparently re-thinking the wisdom of allowing its richest citizen to control private armies.\n\nRelated: With the U.S. F-35 Grounded, Putin\u2019s New Jet Beats Us Hands Down\n\nLast week the Ukrainian government removed the director of the joint-stock company Ukrtransnafta, which manages major oil pipelines in Ukraine. The director had been a key ally of Kolomoisky, who until last week owned a controlling interest in the company. The government in Kiev also changed the rules under which control of joint-stock firms is determined \u2013 undercutting his influence on Ukrtransnafta\u2019s operations.\n\nLast Friday, armed men in masks, widely believed to be members of the militia organized and funded by Kolomoisky, took over the company\u2019s offices in Kiev. The situation was ultimately resolved peacefully \u2013 but it created a problem for Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko. However useful Kolomoisky\u2019s zeal might be on the battlefield, the fact that a regional governor could deploy his own armed forces to the capital city to take over a company greatly undercut the credibility of the Ukrainian central government.\n\nOn Wednesday, Poroshenko fired Kolomoisky \u2013 or according to some reports, \u201caccepted his resignation.\u201d\n\nThe Ukrainian president said, \u201cWe will not have any regional governor with their own pocket army.\u201d He has kept his word. Kolomoisky is no longer a governor. Yet he still has the private army and significant business interests that, as he has shown, he is willing to defend aggressively.\n\nRelated: Putin Wants to Create His Own Version of the Euro\n\nA battle between oligarchs and the central government is clearly not something the Ukrainian government needs at this point. The ceasefire that took hold last month is only barely holding \u2013 sporadic shelling and fighting continue.\n\nMeanwhile, the Russian government continues to send heavy weapons into the part of Ukraine currently held by the rebels, according to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Russian officials have repeatedly expressed interest in placing nuclear weapons in Ukraine\u2019s Crimean peninsula, which Russia invaded last year and then annexed, a move Western governments refuse to recognize.\n\nThe Ukrainian government has no obvious reason to worry that Kolomoisky will switch sides and begin supporting the Russia-backed rebels. Last year he referred to Russian President Vladimir Putin as a \u201cschizophrenic of short stature.\u201d Still, private armies are not something that democracies typically tolerate \u2013 and part of Ukraine\u2019s appeal to the West is that it offers a democratic alternative to Putin\u2019s increasingly autocratic rule of Russia.\n\nIt\u2019s an issue Poroshenko and his government will have to deal with, likely in short order.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The Ukrainian government has to make a decision: Support the oligarch who created his own private army to combat Russia \u2013 or assert the central government\u2019s authority in an increasingly chaotic situation.", "title": "Ukraine\u2019s New Problem: An Oligarch with a Private Army", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/03/26/Ukraine-s-New-Problem-Oligarch-Private-Army", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/03072014_Ukraine_USA.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/03/26/Ukraine-s-New-Problem-Oligarch-Private-Army", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/03072014_Ukraine_USA.jpg", "title": "The Fiscal Times", "card": "summary", "creator": "@rrgarver"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "The Ukrainian government has to make a decision: Support the oligarch who created his own private army to combat Russia \u2013 or assert the central government\u2019s authority in an increasingly chaotic situation.", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "As the rebels took over much of Ukraine\u2019s Donbass region, Kolomoisky and his fighters pushed back, fighting side-by-side with government soldiers.\nLast Friday, armed men in masks, widely believed to be members of the militia organized and funded by Kolomoisky, took over the company\u2019s offices in Kiev.\nYet he still has the private army and significant business interests that, as he has shown, he is willing to defend aggressively.\nHe emerged last year in Ukraine\u2019s time of need with the ability and willingness to help the central government in Kiev.\nUntil Wednesday, Kolomoisky was the governor of Ukraine\u2019s Dnipropetrovsk Oblast."}
