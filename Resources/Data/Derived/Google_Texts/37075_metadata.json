Meanwhile, city officials insist the severity of the drought is leaving them with limited options.\n\nThe federal government has classified Linda Creek as a \u201cperennial creek\u201d \u2014 meaning one that should flow steadily year round \u2014 though California\u2019s three-year drought has left it with several dry spots.\n\n\u201cThe surviving wildlife is stranded in ponds that are going stagnant with no oxygen or fresh water,\u201d said Donna Wilson, spokesperson for Friends of Linda Creek. Wilson owns a home along the water, or what\u2019s left of it. The Friends of the Creek group has corresponded with the city since June, in most cases communicating directly with Environmental Utilities Director Richard Plecker.\n\nPlecker spoke before Roseville City Council Wednesday evening, attempting to clarify the city\u2019s obligation to the creek.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to say that the city, for the better part of 30 years, has released water into Linda Creek as part of an agreement with Placer County,\u201d Plecker explained.\n\nThe City of Roseville traditionally releases clean, un-recycled water into Linda Creek from May until winter. Due to water conservation efforts, the city opted not to turn on its water flow to the creek this past May.\n\n\u201cIn our agreement (terms) provide for Stage 3 drought conditions, that the city ceases releasing water into the creek, so we did that,\u201d Plecker said. \u201cWater was flowing in the creek for some time after that, up until the Fourth of July or so.\u201d\n\nRoseville did begin its seasonal contribution to Linda Creek on July 14, following weeks of correspondence with Friends of Linda Creek, in hopes of restoring \u201cabout half the flow (it) once provided, even considering the drought conditions,\u201d according to Plecker. City officials believe they were able to surpass that 50 percent objective and provide about 70 percent of Linda Creek\u2019s normal water supply.\n\nHowever, the depleted state of the creek has created circumstances under which it will take several weeks for the flow to be consistent in all parts of the waterway. This is partly due to the fact that some water has been diverted by agencies along the creek holding specific water rights.\n\n\u201cWe found out that Tree Lake had retained (the water) to do cleaning of their ponds,\u201d Wilson pointed out. \u201cThey had weeds and debris from lack of water. It took two weeks for that process\u2026July 31, Tree Lake started releasing water over their dams. We still don\u2019t have water, it\u2019s moving slowly.\u201d\n\nPlecker said it\u2019s the duty of California officials to act on situations such as the Tree Lake development.\n\n\u201cThey should have received a cease and desist order from the state board to stop diverting water, if they were doing so,\u201d Plecker commented. \u201cThat\u2019s not something the city really gets involved in.\u201d\n\nPlecker also mentioned that in Roseville\u2019s most recent findings, several natural springs that typically contribute to local creeks have also suffered during the drought.\n\n\u201cAt this stage, given where we\u2019re at with our water supply, Folsom Lake and all the various complaints that we\u2019re faced with, I just really can\u2019t recommend that we increase the flow rate,\u201d Plecker told Roseville City Council members. \u201cWe\u2019re very concerned about what\u2019s gonna\u2019 happen at Folsom later this year. A good part of our strategy moving forward relies on hope for some rain in October. I\u2019m not sure we have any more water to give at this particular point.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"geo.region": "US", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "geo.position": "37.09024;-95.712891", "robots": "index, follow", "fb": {"app_id": 169449507770}, "ICBM": "37.09024, -95.712891", "keywords": "news, the press tribune,local news, Roseville News, Granite Bay news, national news, state news, breaking news, crime log, sports, national sports, local sports, classifieds, Roseville photos, Roseville health, Roseville fitness, Roseville dinning guide,ski Roseville report, Roseville sports score, living, Roseville arts, Roseville entertainment", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Local Roseville news.
