Vice President Joe Biden offered some advice Monday on how to avoid embarrassing moments like his “big f—ing deal” utterance: Assume every microphone is on.

A man introducing Biden at the kickoff of the Road 2 Recovery Memorial Challenge in which cyclists, including injured veterans, ride from Washington to Virginia Beach, said the ride was also a “big f—ing deal,” according to CNN.

The vice president was famously caught on a microphone in 2010 telling President Barack Obama that the passing of the Affordable Care Act was a “big f—ing deal.”

“I just want you to know, I didn’t intentionally say that,” Biden said at the event on Monday. “I actually turned and I said, ‘Mr. President,’ and I whispered in his ear. Unfortunately, I was looking in the direction of one guy who could actually read lips — not a joke. Because no one picked it up at the time and one of the reporters read lips. Thank God my mother was gone or I’d have been one dead vice president.”
