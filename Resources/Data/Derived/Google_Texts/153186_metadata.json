But you do have one option: negotiating your bill to a lower price. A lot of people don\u2019t consider that, and it\u2019s a difficult thing to tackle if you don\u2019t know how to handle it. Jen Wieczner, reporter for the Wall Street Journal and MarketWatch, joined us to talk about how to haggle down your health care bills.\n\n\u201cWhen you think about haggling and negotiating, maybe you\u2019re thinking more of a flea market,\" Wieczner says. \"There\u2019s actually a lot of leeway to negotiate with the hospital and agree on a price that\u2019s more affordable for the consumer.\"\n\nWhat's the first step if you're handed a bill you can't pay?\n\n\"A good place to start is going back to the hospital and saying, 'I can\u2019t pay this.' If you were going through insurance, sometimes the price charged to insurance is different than the price charged to consumers.\" Wieczner says. If you ask to pay upfront, you might be given a lower price. In a situation where the bill is $2,000, you might be able to get the price to $500 if you\u2019re willing to pay cash upfront.\n\nAmericans pay more for health care than in many other developed nations. Why?\n\nBut not all bills are manageable by a one-time cash payment. When it comes to more expensive bills, Wieczner suggests asking for a payment plan, \"if you can work out a plan, where you can pay it with little interest or no interest, that might be more doable.\"\n\nAnother tip: make sure the bill you received matches up with the care you received. \"There's about 69,000 medical billing codes. When there\u2019s that many out there, there\u2019s a good chance they\u2019re going to mess up sometime.\"\n\nIf you\u2019re still struggling to pay a medical bill, there are groups and companies that will help bring health care costs down for a fee, either a commission or percentage of how much they save from your bill, or an upfront cost. \"You might say, 'I\u2019m already dealing with this bill, how am I going to afford to pay services like that?\u2019 But some [consumer advocates] will work on commission if you really can\u2019t afford it. They\u2019re usually pretty affordable.\"\n\nBut don\u2019t ignore the bill. Wieczner notes the bill would then go to creditors, and could eventually lead to more fees and get more expensive as time goes on.", "article_metadata": {"csrf-param": "authenticity_token", "application-name": "Marketplace from APM", "og": {"url": "http://www.marketplace.org/2013/09/13/health-care/how-negotiate-your-health-care-bills", "image": "http://cms.marketplace.org/sites/default/files/styles/primary-image-900x500/public/medical-bill.jpg?itok=e-zU04Jj", "type": "article", "description": "A few options if you find yourself on the bad end of a medical emergency with no way to pay for it.", "title": "How to negotiate your health care bills"}, "twitter": {"site": "@Marketplace"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFF", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "/assets/mstile-70x70-797ef1ac7d8ffe040b98bab7140abf109b307280019c7d5c16c614ac6f66319d.png", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "/assets/mstile-310x310-9380546aaae2d32ed4a1460d4ffac0ddd0197d240c08a97d9ba80e663f2f42e2.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "/assets/mstile-310x150-11f7c8519056bc96bf2540c4b2aa8564178ebcae2594d3e8fb28d480f2c5cd8a.png", "csrf-token": "rn/SfuIRA6+LiZKuaDVPklKB/WiXHwWsw3lEUEbg0q0Yp7J1L5ZMUYnCL5eHfPY2RKzeneCFup8gp4Lbx2Ruxw==", "msapplication-TileImage": "/assets/mstile-144x144-a9640051fbfb73c1de9771231343135b5f79295e3f98bb1cb87854aa6a74f8c8.png", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "/assets/mstile-150x150-1d103d04b61aaa10bb165f225c46e694338b92918bc7a7ca2b99b54bdd1bbc0c.png", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Have you ever negotiated to bring down the costs of a health care bill?\nJen Wieczner, reporter for the Wall Street Journal and MarketWatch, joined us to talk about how to haggle down your health care bills.\nAmericans pay more for health care than in many other developed nations.\n- Creative CommonsInsurance can cover many things, but it won't always prevent you from receiving a costly medical bill.\n\"There\u2019s actually a lot of leeway to negotiate with the hospital and agree on a price that\u2019s more affordable for the consumer.\""}
