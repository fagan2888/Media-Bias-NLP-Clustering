Robert Bentley used part of his State of the State Address on Tuesday to offer a full-throated defense of his decision to reject Medicaid expansion, one of the key components of President Barack Obama\u2019s health care law.\n\nUnder the Affordable Care Act, the federal government will pay 100 percent of the cost of expansion for the first three years and then 90 percent after that.\n\n\u201cBut how can we believe the federal government will keep its word?\u201d said Bentley, one of a number of governors who took advantage of a U.S. Supreme Court ruling to turn down the deal. \u201cThe anything but Affordable Care Act has done nothing to gain our trust.\u201d\n\nSpeaking to a joint session of the Legislature in Montgomery, Bentley drew one of his loudest applause lines by recounting some of the famous promises of Obamacare. Supporters claimed people would be able to keep their doctors and health policies, and that premiums would not go up.\n\n\u201cNow they are telling us we\u2019ll get \u2018free money\u2019 to expand Medicaid,\u201d he said. \u201cLadies and gentlemen, nothing is free. The money the federal government is spending with wild abandon is not \u2018federal\u2019 dollars. Those are your dollars, your hard-earned tax dollars.\u201d\n\nBentley has come under fierce criticism from state pension fund chief David Bronner and others who contend that his refusal to accept increased federal funding for Medicaid will cost the state jobs.\n\nAlabama Senate Minority Leader Craig Ford, D-Gadsden, argued in his official response that the state has one of the most efficient Medicaid systems in the country.\n\n\u201cBut it is struggling to get by after significant cuts over the past three years,\u201d he said.\n\nFord suggested raising the cigarette tax by $1 per pack, which he said would bring in $230 million a year and close a hole in the Medicaid budget.\n\n\n\nOn Tuesday, Bentley reiterated his contention that it would be wrong to bring hundreds of thousands of additional residents into a system that is \u201cbroken and buckling.\u201d\n\nHe noted that Medicaid spending has increased nationally by more than 1,500 percent since 1980 and that the program consumes up to 35 percent of Alabama\u2019s General Fund.\n\n\u201cAnd under Obamacare, Medicaid would grow even larger \u2013 bringing millions more people to a state of dependency on government, and saddling our state and our nation \u2013 the taxpayers \u2013 with the enormous expense,\u201d said the governor, who added that an expansion would siphon millions of dollars from the education budget by 2016.\n\nBentley recited familiar criticisms of Obamacare, from the 18 taxes included in the law to the well-publicized cancelation of some 87,000 insurance policies in Alabama deemed substandard by the statute.\n\nThe governor claimed the Affordable Care Act threatens \u201cone of the most trusted relationships \u2013 that of a doctor and their patient.\u201d He drew on his personal experience as dermatologist prior to entering politics.\n\n\u201cAs a practicing physician, I would never want anything to come between me and my patient \u2013 especially the federal government,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said he has maintained his physician\u2019s license even into the governor\u2019s mansion. \u201cBut I am licensed by the state of Alabama, not the federal government.\u201d\n\nBentley explained reforms already under way in the existing Medicaid program. It involves setting up regional care organizations that aim to use \u201ccommunity-based, managed care to improve the health\u201d of recipients and save taxpayers money.\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Affordable Care Act, alabama legislature 2014, State of the State, news", "title": "Governor Bentley offers unapologetic defense of decision to reject Medicaid expansion", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Governor Bentley offers unapologetic defense of decision to reject Medicaid expansion \", \"link\": \"http://blog.al.com/wire/2014/01/governor_bentley_offers_unapol.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://image.al.com/home/bama-media/width620/img/alphotos/photo/2014/01/14089167-standard.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"11991829\", \"pub_date\": \"2014-01-15T02:19:59Z\", \"author\": \"Brendan Kirby\", \"tags\": [\"@river-all\",\"@river-beaches\",\"Affordable Care Act\",\"alabama legislature 2014\",\"State of the State\"] }", "twitter": {"image": "http://image.al.com/home/bama-media/width620/img/alphotos/photo/2014/01/14089167-standard.jpg", "description": "Alabama Gov.
