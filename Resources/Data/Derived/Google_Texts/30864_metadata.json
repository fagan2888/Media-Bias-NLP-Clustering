One gay marketing group is banking on a belting Christmas tune and shirtless men in tiny, tiny pants. Gay Republicans, though, aren\u2019t feeling the festive cheer.\n\nYou can watch the ad, entitled \u201cGet Enrolled\u201d as a parody of \u201cLet it Snow,\u201d below. A word of caution: if offended by shirtless men in small pants, the auditory terror of camp tunes, or a dose of glaring Christmas cheer, this video may not be for you:\n\nThe ad is brought to us by Out2Enroll as a joint project between the Center for American Progress, the Sellers Dorsey Foundation, and the Federal Agencies Project. As such, it isn\u2019t actually directly affiliated with the Obama administration. Yes it\u2019s silly, yes it\u2019s obviously using sex to sell the product or at the very least get us talking about it, but it is for a good cause.\n\nHealth insurance coverage for same-sex couples and trans individuals is something that, prior to the Affordable Care Act, was hard to secure. So-called Obamacare isn\u2019t perfect, and there\u2019s been a great deal of discussion about its problems before, but Out2Enroll is aiming to make access to affordable healthcare as easy as possible for LGBT people, with its easy to understand guides and resources.\n\nApparently though, all this was lost on the leading Republican gay group the Log Cabin Republicans who decided this week to pour scorn on the ad and use it to attack President Obama. Said the LCR in a statement:\n\n\u201cThis cynical ad betrays the depths Obamacare advocates will sink to in order to pad their pathetic enrollment numbers,\u201d Log Cabin Republicans Executive Director Gregory T. Angelo declared. \u201cAs a self-proclaimed \u2018fierce advocate\u2019 of gay equality, President Obama would do well to distance himself from this nonsense and denounce it immediately. This ad is also an example of the left promoting harmful stereotypes that gay men are nothing more than sex-crazed lechers. If anyone on the right made such a comparison, liberals would be apoplectic. At a time when left-wing propagandists are decrying Duck Dynasty\u2018s Phil Robertson for equating homosexuality with promiscuity and deviance, Out2Enroll and others should take a look in the mirror and ask if the truth is that they are the ones responsible for promoting such harmful stereotypes.\u201d\n\nFirst of all, the ad is nothing like Duck Dynasty star Phil Roberston comparing homosexuality to bestiality. It just isn\u2019t.\n\nSecond, as to what the \u201charmful stereotypes\u201d this ad is apparently supporting, I\u2019m unsure. True, it features men whose body fat looks to be in single digits, but they\u2019re not requiring you to have visible abs before you can get health insurance. I\u2019d also point out that this ad at least features a kind of honest exploitation \u2014 whereas the Conservative group Generation Opportunity\u2019s anti-Obamacare ad campaign used a scaremongering and quite frankly ridiculous \u201cCreepy Uncle Sam\u201d prostate exam video to shock young college students not to take out insurance.\n\nLastly, it seems that the Log Cabin Republicans have forgotten that Obama is not affiliated with this ad in any way, so attacking him is opportunistic and nothing more. Rather than talking about the substantial issues of healthcare and the problems LGBTs face (as well as solutions), the Log Cabin Republicans have chosen what appears to be partisan politics. That\u2019s terribly sad. It\u2019s also appallingly humorless.\n\nThe deadline for enrollment for a healthcare plan was December 23 \u2014 that\u2019s for coverage starting in January. A more pressing deadline will come in March when all Americans will be required to have insurance or potentially face fines. The nice thing about this story is, the Log Cabin Republicans have given us reason to talk about the issue, draw even more attention to the ad and highlight the important message behind its frippery.\n\nSo thanks LCR, and to you and everyone a healthy festive holiday!\n\nPhoto credit: screenshot of YouTube video.", "article_metadata": {"description": "How do you get gay men to sign up for health insurance?
