Obama has said he\u2019ll veto the repeal measure, and Democrats in each chamber have enough votes to block an override by the Republican majority.\n\n\u201cWe are confronting the president with the hard, honest truth: Obamacare doesn\u2019t work,\u201d House Speaker Paul Ryan told reporters in Washington. He set up the repeal legislation as the first vote on Republicans\u2019 election-year agenda.\n\nThe measure passed Wednesday, H.R. 3762, provides the beginning of a template for how Republicans would address health care in 2017 if they win the presidency and keep control of the House and Senate.\n\nWhile retaining parts of the Affordable Care Act, the measure would eliminate penalties for not complying with its requirement that individuals and large employers buy insurance for themselves and their workers. The Obama administration contends that would encourage healthy policyholders to drop coverage, causing a \u201cdeath spiral\u201d of rate increases for less healthy people who retain their policies.\n\nThe bill also would cancel, in 2018, the law\u2019s expansion of the federal-state Medicaid health program for the poor, as well as subsidies for people who buy insurance coverage through federal or state exchanges.\n\nThe vote was well short of the two-thirds majority needed to override a presidential veto. One Democrat, Collin Peterson of Minnesota, voted for the repeal, while three Republicans opposed it: Robert Dold of Illinois, and Richard Hanna and John Katko, both of New York.\n\n\u2018Repeal and Replace\u2019\n\nRepublicans have repeatedly said they want to \u201crepeal and replace\u201d the Affordable Care Act, though they haven\u2019t coalesced around a replacement plan.\n\n\u201cJust wait,\u201d Ryan, a Wisconsin Republican, told reporters Wednesday when asked what Republicans would offer as an alternative. The speaker, who took over the job in October, is asking House committees to work on an alternative. Budget Committee Chairman Tom Price of Georgia said Tuesday the goal is \u201cto have a piece of legislation we can be proud of.\u201d\n\nThe legislation passed Wednesday also would deny federal money for Planned Parenthood, the reproductive health-care organization that Republicans have sought to defund since undercover videos purported to show its officials discussing reimbursement for providing tissue from aborted fetuses to medical researchers. Planned Parenthood said it received only the cost of providing the tissue, and it later stopped taking such payments.\n\nPlanned Parenthood receives about $450 million in federal funds annually, most of it through Medicaid coverage for health- care services for the poor. A ban on federally funded abortions has been in place for decades. Bloomberg Philanthropies provides financial support for Planned Parenthood.\n\nAll Democratic Votes\n\nRepublicans have sought to kill the Affordable Care Act since Congress enacted it during Obama\u2019s first term with all Democratic votes. The House has voted more than 50 times to repeal, defund or delay the law. This latest attempt marks the first time such a measure got through the Senate because lawmakers used a procedure allowing the Republican majority to pass it without having to overcome a Democratic filibuster.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s make the president decide,\u201d Representative Bradley Byrne, an Alabama Republican, said during floor debate. \u201cLet\u2019s hold him accountable.\u201d\n\nThe repeal bill is \u201cgoing nowhere,\u201d Representative Jim McGovern, a Massachusetts Democrat, told Republicans at a House Rules Committee meeting Tuesday. \u201cWe go through these motions so you can go back and tell your right-wing base that you are doing something when you are basically running in place.\u201d\n\nThe White House has said Obama would veto the repeal bill because it would \u201ctake away critical benefits and health-care coverage from hard-working middle-class families.\u201d Ryan said on Fox News Channel\u2019s \u201cHannity\u201d program Tuesday that the House will attempt to override the veto later in January.\n\nAbout 17.6 million previously uninsured people have gained coverage under Affordable Care Act provisions including expanded Medicaid, marketplace insurance plans, and young people allowed to stay on their parents\u2019 plans through age 26, the Department of Health and Human Services estimated in September.\n\nPre-Existing Conditions\n\nThe measure wouldn\u2019t entirely dismantle the Affordable Care Act. For example, it would retain the requirement that insurers offer coverage and set premiums without regard to someone\u2019s pre- existing conditions.\n\nAlso untouched would be revisions in Medicare that reward the value of procedures, rather than the volume of procedures and reduce excessive provider payments.\n\nThat has prompted Democrats to complain that Republicans, while denouncing Obamacare and repealing some key provisions, are holding on to other aspects that help boost their bill\u2019s 10- year deficit-reduction projections.\n\nThe repeal legislation would decrease the U.S. deficit by about $516 billion over 10 years, according to the Congressional Budget Office, Congress\u2019s nonpartisan scorekeeper. It would increase the number of people without health insurance coverage by about 22 million people in most years after 2017, the CBO said in a Dec. 11 letter.\n\nCadillac Tax\n\nIn December, Congress voted in separate tax and spending legislation to suspend three taxes intended to fund the health- care law. A so-called Cadillac tax on high-cost health insurance plans would be delayed from 2018 to 2020; a 2.3 percent tax on medical devices would be paused in 2016 and 2017; and a fee on health insurers would be paused for 2016.\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court has twice upheld key provisions of the Affordable Care Act. The court in June preserved subsidies that help millions of Americans pay their health insurance premiums. Obama said at the time that the law has helped tens of millions of Americans and is here to stay.\n\n\u2013With assistance from Zachary Tracer.\n\nCopyright 2016 Bloomberg.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30;polling-uri=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.insurancejournal.com/rss/mostpopular/&polling-uri2=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.insurancejournal.com/rss/mostpopular/&id=2;polling-uri3=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.insurancejournal.com/rss/mostpopular/&id=3;polling-uri4=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.insurancejournal.com/rss/mostpopular/&id=4;polling-uri5=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.insurancejournal.com/rss/mostpopular/&id=5; cycle=1", "description": "The House voted Wednesday to repeal most of Obamacare, sending legislation to President Barack Obama for the first time that would dismantle his biggest do", "application-name": "Insurance Journal", "og": {"site_name": "Insurance Journal", "description": "The House voted Wednesday to repeal most of Obamacare, sending legislation to President Barack Obama for the first time that would dismantle his biggest do", "title": "Obama to Veto Affordable Care Act Repeal Passed by Congress", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://www.insurancejournal.com/img/insurancejournal-square.png", "updated_time": "2016-01-07T08:50:55-04:00", "url": "http://www.insurancejournal.com/news/national/2016/01/07/394336.htm", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The House voted Wednesday to repeal most of Obamacare, sending legislation to President Barack Obama for the first time that would dismantle his biggest do", "creator": "@ijournal", "image": "https://www.insurancejournal.com/img/insurancejournal-square.png", "title": "Obama to Veto Affordable Care Act Repeal Passed by Congress", "site": "@ijournal", "card": "summary"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#B10000", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "/img/insurance-journal-tile-128x128.png", "robots": "noodp", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "/img/insurance-journal-tile-558x558.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "/img/insurance-journal-tile-558x270.png", "fb": {"page_id": 75524109257, "pages": 75524109257, "app_id": 106194681485}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/img/insurance-journal-tile-144x144.png", "msapplication-starturl": "/?utm_source=windows&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=windows-pinned-sites", "date": "2016-01-07", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/insurancejournal", "section": "National News", "tag": "Republicans Obamacare", "published_time": "2016-01-07T08:43:59-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-01-07T08:50:55-04:00"}, "msapplication-square150x150logo": "/img/insurance-journal-tile-270x270.png"}, "article_summary": "All Democratic VotesRepublicans have sought to kill the Affordable Care Act since Congress enacted it during Obama\u2019s first term with all Democratic votes.\n\u2018Repeal and Replace\u2019Republicans have repeatedly said they want to \u201crepeal and replace\u201d the Affordable Care Act, though they haven\u2019t coalesced around a replacement plan.\nThe 240-181 House vote, following Senate passage of the bill Dec. 3, won\u2019t succeed in undoing the 2010 Affordable Care Act.\nThe U.S. Supreme Court has twice upheld key provisions of the Affordable Care Act.\nPre-Existing ConditionsThe measure wouldn\u2019t entirely dismantle the Affordable Care Act."}
