(Photo: Michael Zamora/The Register)Buy Photo\n\nMany cities in America, and the metro, see economic value in tweaking suburban development models, making them more urban or walkable \u2014 multi-story or multi-use properties, built close to streets with sidewalks, on-street parking and bike lanes.\n\nWindsor Heights is in a unique position. It is between downtown and the mall, along the interstate and also bike trails. With many of its buildings aging and heading toward re-development, it is the perfect place for building a more walkable suburb.\n\nColby Interests is attempting to re-zone and re-develop part of an old strip mall near 73rd Street and University Avenue [\"Apple Valley demolition will displace retailers,\" Aug. 12]. But instead of a multi-use, well-massed building that would help set a new tone for the city and encourage more development and interest from entrepreneurs, they have proposed an Aldi grocery store \u2014 with typical massing, setbacks and parking.\n\nRe-zoning this land would be a major misstep for a city with so much potential.\n\n\u2014 Mike Draper, Windsor Heights, owner of RAYGUN\n\n\n\n\n\nRead or Share this story: http://dmreg.co/1F7uZlB", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Proposed re-zoning of neighborhood strip mall as a grocery store would be a misstep for suburb with so much potential", "p": {"domain_verify": "372c291dc2b106308d26264f4fba3b10"}, "og": {"site_name": "Des Moines Register", "description": "Proposed re-zoning of neighborhood strip mall as a grocery store would be a misstep for suburb with so much potential", "title": "Make Windsor Heights more walkable", "url": "http://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/opinion/readers/2015/09/18/make-windsor-heights-more-walkable/72404494/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/desmoinesregister.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Proposed re-zoning of neighborhood strip mall as a grocery store would be a misstep for suburb with so much potential", "title": "Make Windsor Heights more walkable", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/800630dd5c616c29b25d84b5459b406cf02d6db4/c=960-0-4800-3840&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/08/12/DesMoines/B9318429491Z.1_20150812195855_000_G83BJOT8H.1-0.jpg", "creator": "@DMRegister", "site": "@DMRegister", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600025120", "fb": {"app_id": 169766623060429}, "viewport": "width=1070", "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Persons/Mike Draper", "gci-asset-type": "story", "gci-categories": "Persons/Mike Draper", "title": "Make Windsor Heights more walkable", "author": "Mike Draper, Windsor Heights", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "opinion/readers", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/c72fc348fa6bc2747180f692a2131f99b9f734f5/c=1440-0-4320-3840/local/-/media/2015/08/12/DesMoines/B9318429491Z.1_20150812195855_000_G83BJOT8H.1-0.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/98bf8e596c32510f94f4c1c778ff11fda8fbcb3a/c=960-0-4800-3840/local/-/media/2015/08/12/DesMoines/B9318429491Z.1_20150812195855_000_G83BJOT8H.1-0.jpg", "contenttype": "story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/f2ce35cb0bc3c3f1fa72c1a12fd6c099318b932a/c=320-0-5440-3840/local/-/media/2015/08/12/DesMoines/B9318429491Z.1_20150812195855_000_G83BJOT8H.1-0.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/2f58cd65e1ebc537e90e0572c38e1c9187a60894/c=0-300-5760-3540&r=x1683&c=3200x1680/local/-/media/2015/08/12/DesMoines/B9318429491Z.1_20150812195855_000_G83BJOT8H.1-0.jpg", "publishtime": "2015-09-18T20:16:45.947000-05:00", "shorthed": "Make Windsor Heights more walkable", "articleid": 72404494, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/421b078e32ec24dfbab35e78c8c4cec779ade847/c=0-300-5760-3540/local/-/media/2015/08/12/DesMoines/B9318429491Z.1_20150812195855_000_G83BJOT8H.1-0.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/48df83f7285729a6166f4a8d36f71b4cd1d569c0/c=1800-0-3960-3840/local/-/media/2015/08/12/DesMoines/B9318429491Z.1_20150812195855_000_G83BJOT8H.1-0.jpg"}}, "news_keywords": "Windsor Heights, Aldi grocery store, Colby Interests, Raygun, Mike Draper"}, "article_summary": "\u2014 Mike Draper, Windsor Heights, owner of RAYGUNRead or Share this story: http://dmreg.co/1F7uZlB\nWindsor Heights is in a unique position.\nBuy Photo Some tenants are still looking for new locations now that the Apple Valley Shopping Center in Windsor Heights is being torn down to make way for new development.\nWith many of its buildings aging and heading toward re-development, it is the perfect place for building a more walkable suburb.\nIt is between downtown and the mall, along the interstate and also bike trails."}
