By duping her into taking a drug known to cause miscarriage, Welden deprived Lee of her constitutional right to take their baby to term in \u201cthe most cowardly of ways,\u201d Judge Lazzara held. \u201cI don\u2019t believe Mr. Welden\u2019s an evil person, but he committed an evil act,\u201d he continued. \u201cAnd he\u2019s going to pay the consequences.\u201d\n\nIn September 2013, Welden admitted to tricking the then-pregnant Lee into taking Cytotec, a brand-name version of misoprostol known to cause miscarriage. According to court documents from his arraignment, he relabeled the bottle as \u201camoxicillin,\u201d a common antibiotic. He then told Lee that his father, an OB/GYN in the Tampa area, had prescribed her the pills to treat an infection that could otherwise interfere with the pregnancy.\n\nAlmost immediately after she took the pills, she began experiencing severe cramps. When she sought care at a nearby hospital, doctors told her that she had been exposed to a labor inducing drug. She miscarried shortly thereafter.\n\n\"I was never going to do anything but go full term with it, and he didn't want me to,\" Lee said in an interview with WPTV in Tampa last summer. \"He came to my house with the pills, his weapon of choice.\u201d\n\n\u201cA Caring Person\u201d\n\nWelden, who is diagnosed with bipolar disorder, was described by friends and family as a loving, loyal, and selfless young man with dreams of going to medical school. \u201cAndrew is a caring person,\u201d his father, Dr. Stephen Welden, told the court. \u201cIt\u2019s what he does; it\u2019s who he is.\u201d\n\nHowever, few of these sentiments were echoed by the victim\u2019s family, who called Welden a callous, calculating pothead responsible for the death of his own child. \u201cThis was not a mistake,\u201d Lee\u2019s mother, Rosa, said. \u201cHe made a plan and followed through with it.\u201d\n\nAfter handing down the sentence, Judge Lazzara denied a request from the defense that Welden remain free until federal prison officials determine where he will serve his time, ordering him to report to U.S. Marshals no later than 9:30 a.m. on Wednesday. \u201cThere comes a time when justice exacts its due, and that time has come for Mr. Welden,\u201d Judge Lazzara concluded.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "john andrew welden sentence, john andrew welden abortion pill, remee jo lee abortion pill, misoprostol miscarriage, stephen welden ob gyn tampa", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "John Andrew Weldon will serve nearly 14 years for tricking his pregnant girlfriend into taking a miscarriage-inducing \"abortion pill,\" a Florida court ruled Monday.", "title": "Man Who Tricked Pregnant Girlfriend Into Taking Abortion Pill Will Serve Nearly 14 Years In Prison", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/john-andrew-welden-fla-man-who-tricked-pregnant-girlfriend-taking-abortion-pill-sentenced-nearly-14", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/30/john-andrew-welden.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "John Andrew Weldon will serve nearly 14 years for tricking his pregnant girlfriend into taking a miscarriage-inducing \"abortion pill,\" a Florida court ruled Monday.", "title": "Man Who Tricked Pregnant Girlfriend Into Taking Abortion Pill Will Serve Nearly 14 Years In Prison", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/john-andrew-welden-fla-man-who-tricked-pregnant-girlfriend-taking-abortion-pill-sentenced-nearly-14", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/30/john-andrew-welden.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/30/john-andrew-welden.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2014-01-28T18:37:30-05:00", "modified_time": "2014-01-28T18:42:23-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "John Andrew Weldon will serve nearly 14 years for tricking his pregnant girlfriend into taking a miscarriage-inducing \"abortion pill,\" a Florida court ruled Monday."}, "_id": "\"57477afa6914bd0286fe6425\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThere comes a time when justice exacts its due, and that time has come for Mr. Welden,\u201d Judge Lazzara concluded.\nJohn Andrew Welden, the Florida man who tricked his pregnant girlfriend into taking an \u201cabortion pill,\u201d will serve nearly 14 years in federal prison, a Florida court ruled on Monday.\n\u201cAndrew is a caring person,\u201d his father, Dr. Stephen Welden, told the court.\nBy duping her into taking a drug known to cause miscarriage, Welden deprived Lee of her constitutional right to take their baby to term in \u201cthe most cowardly of ways,\u201d Judge Lazzara held.\nU.S. District Court Judge Richard Lazzara in Tampa, Fla. also sentenced 29-year-old Welden to three months of supervision following his release and ordered him to pay $28,500 in restitution to his former girlfriend, 27-year-old Remee Jo Lee."}
