The intel measure would cap CTIIC staff at 50, and forbid the agency from augmenting that number through outside contractors and executive branch employees who are temporarily assigned to another role.\n\n\u201cThe limits this bill would place on CTIIC\u2019s resources, and the expansive approach the bill would take with regard to CTIIC\u2019s missions, are unnecessary and unwise, and would risk the CTIIC being unable to fully perform the core functions assigned to it in the bill,\u201d the White House said.\n\nHouse Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) has defended the bill's text.\n\n\"The CTIIC\u2019s mission was crafted to ensure that the new center would not duplicate existing ODNI cyber efforts,\" said Jack Langer, a spokesman for Nunes, in a statement to The Hill.\n\nLanger added that the bill's CTIIC language \"mirrors\" other \"successful ODNI centers,\" such as the National Counterproliferation Center, which combats the spread of nuclear arms and other weapons of mass destruction.\n\nRepublican leaders have also backed the bill as taking the necessary steps to thwart cyberattacks, which have targeted numerous government agencies over the past year. Most recently, a breach at the Office of Personnel Management may have exposed up to 14 million people\u2019s information.\n\n\u201cThis bill sustains and strengthens our capabilities to combat terrorism, cyberattacks, and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, while making every taxpayer dollar count,\u201d Speaker John Boehner John BoehnerOvernight Finance: Puerto Rico bill clears panel | IRS chief vows to finish term | Bill would require nominees to release tax returns Overnight Defense: Pentagon chief fears sequestration's return GOP senator: Reid's 'ramblings' are 'bitter, vulgar, incoherent' MORE (R-Ohio) said in a statement after Tuesday\u2019s vote.\n\nSenate lawmakers have yet to unveil their companion legislation.
