Tatiana Bulyonkova, CC BY-NC-SA 2.0\n\nPower naps influence memory recall, according to a new study out Saarland University in Germany.\n\nResearchers cited studies that have shown short naps (about an hour) can positively influence memory performance. But, they wanted to better understand the role naps play in both associative and item memory. The American Psychological Association defines associative memory (AM) as \u201cthe ability to learn and remember the relationship between unrelated items, such as the name of someone we have just met.\u201d Item memory (IM), on the other hand, refers to the ability to recall items, such as the names of friends, phone numbers, even an ATM password.\n\nIn which case, researchers taught and tested 41 participants 90 single words and 120 word pairs, such as \u201cmilk-taxi.\u201d The word pairs were purposefully unrelated so participants would need to access the specific memory of the corresponding episode in the brain\u2019s hippocampus (where it\u2019s believed memories are consolidated). After their memory tests, half of the participants were allowed to sleep and the rest watched a DVD.\n\nWhen participants were re-tested after their nap and movie, those who took a nap retained more word pairs in memory than those who didn\u2019t take a nap. In other words, their AM (not IM) had improved. In fact, researchers found a short sleep lasting between 45-minutes and an hour produced a five-fold improvement in memory recall.\n\n\u201cThe control group, whose members watched DVDs while the other group slept, performed significantly worse than the nap group when it came to remembering the word pairs,\u201d Dr. Axel Mecklinger, who supervised the study, said in a press release. \u201cThe memory performance of the participants who had a power nap was just as good as it was before sleeping, that is, immediately after completing the learning phase.\u201d\n\nDespite power nap participant's memory performance not changing much before and after sleep, their recall was constant and consistent with researcher's predictions.\n\nAdditionally, researchers were able to better study sleep spindles, \u201ca particular type of brain activity\u2026that plays an important role in memory consolidation during sleep.\" Sara Studte, lead study author and a graduate biologist specializing in neuropsychology, suspected these sleep spindles work to consolidate certain memory types. And she found they do.\n\nSuccessfully learning and retrieving information before and after sleep related to spindle density during a power nap, Studte said. Put it another way: the greater number of sleep spindles seen in a participant's brain, the stronger their AM was.\n\nSource: Studte S, Bridger E, and Mecklinger A.
