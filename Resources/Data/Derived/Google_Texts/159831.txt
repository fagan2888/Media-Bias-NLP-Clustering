Two weeks before the open enrollment deadline for Obamacare closes on March 31, the White House keeps pulling out the big creative guns to promote Healthcare.gov to the younger set. Earlier this week, President Barack Obama subjected himself to Zach Galifianakis' bumble-headed interviewer from the comedian's "Between Two Ferns" online series on Funny or Die — a play that led to a 40 percent jump in traffic to HealthCare.gov.

Today, the Obama administration has turned to celebrities' moms — and agency Droga5 — to provide another last-minute push. In a new video released on YouTube, the mamas of actor Jonah Hill and musicians Jennifer Lopez, Alicia Keys and Adam Levine reminisce about their progeny when they were just kids — how gifted they were as little ones, and how much they had to "put up with" as their parents. But one thing no mother should have to worry about, the argument goes, is whether their children's health will be protected.

"Seriously, do you want your mothers to have a nervous breakdown?" says Sharon Feldstein, Jonah Hill's mother.

(There's no mention of the fact that under the government's healthcare program, children can remain insured under the parents' policies until the age of 26.)

The FLOTUS herself then caps off the vid with her own plea: "We nag you because we love you, so go to HealthCare.gov and enroll today."

"As everyone's original healthcare providers, they earned the right" to promote this cause, said Droga5 Creative Chairman David Droga of the thinking behind the mom-focus. He said each of the mothers riffed before the camera and worked with no script.

Other mom-focused videos are on the way, he said, including the one below focusing on the best-friend moms of Mr. Levine and Mr. Hill.
