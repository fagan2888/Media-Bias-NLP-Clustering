It\u2019s not like concepts of disease are immutable, after all: Homosexuality was a sickness until 1973, when doctors suddenly agreed that it\u2019s wasn\u2019t. Why shouldn\u2019t transgender people similarly shed the stigma of pathology?\n\n\u201cOh, young me,\u201d she laughs to the roughly 60 people packed inside Gay City\u2019s tiny auditorium. \u201cYou didn\u2019t know!\u201d\n\nAskini is speaking on a panel held last Saturday at the Trans Health Insurance Forum, orchestrated by the Coalition for Inclusive Healthcare. And she\u2019s laughing because, in the past five years, she\u2019s gone from decrying transgender diagnoses to sometimes promoting them, for two reasons.\n\nFirst, a shift in what that diagnosis means: in 2013, the American Psychiatric Association updated \u201cGender Identity Disorder\u201d (which treated gender nonconformity per se as an illness) to \u201cGender Dysphoria\u201d (which concentrates on the harm caused by dissonance between experienced- vs. assigned-gender). Second, the Affordable Care Act (AKA Obamacare) has expanded insurance coverage and \u2014 as the Washington Office of the Insurance Commissioner affirmed this past June \u2014 prohibited insurer discrimination against trans-related care.\n\n\u201cA lot of trans people have avoided health insurance for years,\u201d says activist Tobi Hill-Meyer, \u201cbecause they felt like it wouldn\u2019t make sense to pay into a plan that doesn\u2019t cover your basic needs.\u201d\n\nBut now that a Gender Dysphoria diagnosis has become more of a resource and less of a threat to trans people, activists are scrambling for ways to show that trans-related care \u2013from hormones to surgery \u2014 is \u201cmedically necessary\u201d and therefore covered by health insurance. The stakes are high for transgender people, who face widespread discrimination and have an attempted-suicide rate of 41%. Referring to hormone therapy for trans adolescents, audience member Dr. Linda Gromko says, \u201cThis is nothing less than a suicide prevention measure, period.\u201d\n\nPlenty of folks at the Forum have war stories about insurers reflexively denying trans-related claims. One speaker talks about insurers arbitrarily imposing an age-floor of 18. A man in the audience later relates how he was denied chest surgery because, the company claimed, he seemed fine without it.\n\nEmerson Sekins, formerly of the Q Center at UW, recalls a law student at UW who broke her wrist. \u201cOnce the insurance company found out that she was trans,\u201d he says, \u201cthey ordered her to repay everything.\u201d\n\n\u201cInsurance companies\u2026 will find ways to deny you,\u201d adds Askini. The trick, she says, is persistence. \u201cAppeal, appeal, appeal. The worst they can do is say no.\u201d And a history of denials, she says, makes it harder in the future for insurers to wiggle out of class-action lawsuits or inquiries from the state insurance commissioner.\n\nResources for appeals and other trans health insurance issues can be found at Q Law, which holds a free legal clinic once per month on Capitol Hill; the Ingersoll Gender Center; the Gender Justice League; and We-Are-1.com.\n\nShare: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\nReddit\n\nEmail\n\n", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "CHS Capitol Hill Seattle", "description": "In 2009, Danni Askini was raising hell to debunk \u201cGender Identity Disorder\u201d from the official list of diagnosable mental illnesses.
