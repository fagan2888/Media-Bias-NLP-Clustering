Wilson plans to jump again Sunday as he tries to qualify for the U.S. championships.\n\nWilson jumped 48 feet, 1 1/4 inches Saturday; he had posted a wind-aided 53-1 3/4 in college. He last competed in 2011, when he finished sixth at the NCAA meet for Virginia Tech.\n\nBecause of a hamstring injury, Wilson hadn\u2019t tried a full 12-step approach in practice. He assumed that going full speed would allow him to jump farther, but instead it just reminded him he needs to lose more weight. Saturday\u2019s experience was a physics lesson: When he made his initial hop, the extra momentum in fact slowed him down because he could sense those extra pounds more.\n\n\u201cAll the speed I had built up, stopped,\u201d he said, and he didn\u2019t feel in control of the jump.\n\nSo Wilson plans to return to eight steps Sunday, the most he\u2019s done in practice, when he\u2019s jumped 51 feet. He had been hoping for a jump of at least 53-9 on Saturday.\n\nCuba\u2019s Pedro Pablo Pichardo won with a jump of 57-7 1/2.\n\nA state champion triple jumper in high school, Wilson could never devote much time to track and field in college because of his football commitments. But after a serious neck injury forced the former first-round draft pick to retire from the NFL at age 23 in August, he decided to give the triple jump another try.\n\nHis goal is to qualify for the 2016 Rio Olympics, hopeful he can make major improvements now that he\u2019s dedicated to track full time.\n\nAs a rookie in 2012, Wilson led the NFL with a franchise-record 1,533 kickoff return yards. But he was hurt only five games into his second season, when an MRI showed that Wilson had a narrowing of the spinal cord. He underwent surgery and returned for training camp.\n\nBut then during a drill, Wilson caught a pass, put his head down and ran into the back of an offensive lineman. That hit caused numbness in his hands and lower extremities.\n\nDoctors agreed it would be best for Wilson to quit football. Triple jumping poses no risk because there\u2019s no contact.\n\nWilson played at about 210 pounds, but now he\u2019s competing against rivals in the 140-170 range. He had gotten as low as 189 and hopes to reach 180-185 pounds to improve on Saturday\u2019s debut.\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t proud the way I performed,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it was a good experience because I got my feet wet in a professional atmosphere, and now next time when I do get right in training, do get down to the weight I want to be, do get my technique perfect \u2014 I\u2019ll be knowing what to expect.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "David Wilson, ex-Giants RB, makes pro debut in triple jump", "title": "David Wilson, ex-Giants RB, makes pro debut in triple jump", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/06/13/david-wilson-ex-giants-rb-makes-pro-debut-in-triple-jump/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150613_025756_david-wilson.jpg", "height": 486}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150613_025756_david-wilson.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-06-13T14:54:42+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-22T18:50:14+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd988c\"", "article_summary": "But after a serious neck injury forced the former first-round draft pick to retire from the NFL at age 23 in August, he decided to give the triple jump another try.\nNEW YORK \u2014 David Wilson knew he looked like a football player lined up alongside the rest of the triple jumpers at the Adidas Grand Prix.\nWilson plans to jump again Sunday as he tries to qualify for the U.S. championships.\nSo Wilson plans to return to eight steps Sunday, the most he\u2019s done in practice, when he\u2019s jumped 51 feet.\nWilson jumped 48 feet, 1 1/4 inches Saturday; he had posted a wind-aided 53-1 3/4 in college."}
