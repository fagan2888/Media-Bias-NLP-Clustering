I\u2019m running for the Senate because I\u2019m committed to doing everything I can to fix it for Arkansas and for our country,\u201d Eldridge said in a news release.\n\nEldridge served for nearly five years as U.S. attorney for the Western District of Arkansas before resigning Aug. 21. Before becoming U.S. attorney, he worked for Summit Bank and Summit Bancorp in Arkadelphia, where at various times he held the positions of vice president and assistant general counsel, president of the Arkadelphia region and CEO.\n\nHe also has worked for former U.S. Rep. Marion Berry and former U.S. Sen. Blanche Lincoln. He focused on agricultural issues, including legislation before the House and Senate Agriculture committees.\n\nIn an interview Wednesday, Eldridge said his goals include creating jobs, improving education, strengthening communities and addressing threats to public safety. He said that as a U.S. attorney he worked in a bipartisan way to fight crime and that as a senator he would \u201cbring a new perspective that really transcends party lines.\u201d\n\nOn the Affordable Care Act, Eldridge said he does not support repealing it but does believe there are problems with it.\n\n\u201cI would work in a bipartisan way to change those, and among those are the medical-device tax and the cost that\u2019s being borne by businesses that could be improved by an expanded tax credit,\u201d he said.\n\nEldridge said he would work to ensure Arkansas continues to have the flexibility to implement health-care innovations like the private option, the state\u2019s alternative to the Medicaid expansion envisioned under the health-care law.\n\n\u201cThe private option has extended coverage to over 200,000 people that are now \u2026 not going into the emergency room with the highest cost of care to be treated,\u201d he said. \u201cI think that\u2019s an indicator of what Arkansans want, and that is a bipartisan solution that puts Arkansas common sense in the mix in trying to figure out how to solve a problem.\u201d\n\nState Democratic Party Chairman Vince Insalaco said in a statement Wednesday, \u201cAs Arkansans and Democrats, we welcome Conner Eldridge to the race for the U.S. Senate. Conner\u2019s bold leadership as U.S. attorney is proof of his experience and ability to serve the people of Arkansas in the U.S. Senate.\u201d\n\nState Republican Party Chairman Doyle Webb said in a statement, \u201cArkansans made it clear over the past three election cycles that the destructive, liberal policies of Barack Obama are not welcome here. Conner Eldridge has likened himself to Obama, which is not surprising, given Obama\u2019s appointing him U.S. attorney.\u201d\n\nAndrea Bozek, spokeswoman for the National Republican Senatorial Committee, said in a statement, \u201cConner Eldridge might want to remove the line about working for President Obama on his resume, because his ties to the unpopular president make him unelectable in Arkansas. Unlike Conner Eldridge, John Boozman has spent his life caring for Arkansas families and fighting Obama\u2019s reckless policies that have put our country at risk.\u201d\n\nEldridge said the jabs were \u201cjust flat wrong.\u201d\n\n\u201cI worked as U.S. attorney for the people of Arkansas. I took that duty and that oath very seriously, and those are the same people that I\u2019m running in this race to go to bat for in Washington,\u201d he said.\n\nBorn in Fayetteville in 1977, Eldridge spent the first 12 years of his life in Augusta. His family then moved to Lonoke, where he worked on the family farm and graduated from high school. He obtained a bachelor\u2019s degree from Davidson College and a law degree from the University of Arkansas.\n\nDuring law school, Eldridge worked as a law clerk for several law firms in Arkansas and the Washington County prosecutor\u2019s office. After law school, he served as a law clerk for U.S. District Judge G. Thomas Eisele of the Eastern District of Arkansas from 2003-2004.\n\nHe and his wife, Mary Elizabeth, moved from Arkadelphia to Fort Smith and later to Fayetteville after he became U.S. attorney. They have three sons, Will, 8; Henry, 4; and Tull, 3.", "article_metadata": {"description": "LITTLE ROCK \u2014 Former U.S. Attorney Conner Eldridge said Wednesday he will seek the Democratic nomination for the U.S. Senate seat currently held by Republican John Boozman.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "John Lyon Arkansas News Bureau jlyon@arkansasnews.com", "og": {"site_name": "Arkansas News", "description": "LITTLE ROCK \u2014 Former U.S. Attorney Conner Eldridge said Wednesday he will seek the Democratic nomination for the U.S. Senate seat currently held by Republican John Boozman.", "title": "Eldridge to challenge Boozman for Senate seat", "url": "http://arkansasnews.com/news/arkansas/eldridge-challenge-boozman-senate-seat", "image": "http://arkansasnews.com/sites/arkansasnews.com/files/field/media/web1_conner-eldridge_2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://arkansasnews.com/news/arkansas/eldridge-challenge-boozman-senate-seat", "image": {"src": "http://arkansasnews.com/sites/arkansasnews.com/files/field/media/web1_conner-eldridge_2.jpg"}, "title": "Eldridge to challenge Boozman for Senate seat", "card": "summary", "creator": "@arkansasnews"}, "keywords": "Arkansas,News,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-09-09T14:05:09-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=0.9"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1b96\"", "article_summary": "LITTLE ROCK \u2014 Former U.S. Attorney Conner Eldridge said Wednesday he will seek the Democratic nomination for the U.S. Senate seat currently held by Republican John Boozman.\nDuring law school, Eldridge worked as a law clerk for several law firms in Arkansas and the Washington County prosecutor\u2019s office.\nEldridge served for nearly five years as U.S. attorney for the Western District of Arkansas before resigning Aug. 21.\nAfter law school, he served as a law clerk for U.S. District Judge G.
