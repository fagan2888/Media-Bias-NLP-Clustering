I\u2019ve come to love it in many ways, too, as loving the rain is part of loving the rainforest.\n\nFor the first seven days of \u201cOperation Convince Chip and Carrie to Move to Alaska,\u201d (Chip is my brother, here for a visit; Carrie is his girlfriend, who, sadly, couldn\u2019t make it) my boyfriend Bjorn and I had taken Chip kayaking in Tracy Arm and at Admiralty Island in the pouring rain.\n\nBut I was quite happy when Day Eight of Operation Move to Alaska dawned bright and sunny. I\u2019ve been raving to my family about Juneau\u2019s ridge hikes for years, and they\u2019re much better (not to mention safer) when you can see the line of mountains you\u2019re following.\n\nSince the second predicted day of sunshine - the last of Chip\u2019s trip - would be spent fishing, we decided to make our one hike as epic as we could.\n\nObservation Loop is pretty epic.\n\nThough it\u2019s not quite a loop - more of a semi-circle - the route goes up Blackerby Trail, along Blackerby Ridge to the edge of the Juneau Icefield, past Lemon Glacier, up Cairn Peak and up Observation Peak. It then turns across Salmon Ridge (which is perpendicular to and connects Blackerby Ridge and the Juneau Ridge, and is behind Salmon Creek Reservoir) and over the Juneau Ridge, then down Granite Creek Basin and Perseverance Trail. We estimated that including elevation gain and loss it was around 20 miles, though that\u2019s a rough guess.\n\nWe woke up at 5:30 a.m., packed water, snacks, sunglasses, hats, fleeces and sunscreen, dropped a bike at the Mount Juneau trailhead, and we were off.\n\nI\u2019d hiked Blackerby Trail before, but never the whole ridge. The trailhead, located at Greenwood Avenue at Twin Lakes, gives little hint of what\u2019s ahead. As one of the less popular trails in Juneau, Blackerby, which is on U.S. Forest Service land, is not maintained. The brush - salmonberry and blueberry bushes, cow parsnip, devil\u2019s club and other usual suspects - was overgrown and holding onto the rain of the last week, leaving all three of us thankful for our fast-drying pants and long-sleeved shirts.\n\nWe clambered over a few fallen trees and followed the hot pink and orange trail markers on what seemed, much of the time, to be straight up - another thing Blackerby doesn\u2019t have is switchbacks. Some of its forks are also a bit confusing, as both potential paths are sometimes flagged, so I recommend you either go with someone familiar with the trail or prepare yourself for a bit of backtracking.\n\nAfter a while, we left the early morning fog clinging low to Gastineau Channel. The brush thinned, and we entered a small meadow filled with lupine, edged with the shorter, smaller spruce and hemlock of higher altitudes.\n\nChip turned to take in the lupine, the fog a few thousand feet below and the mountains ringing us.\n\n\u201cWow,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is what Alaska\u2019s like when it\u2019s sunny?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not even to the real view yet,\u201d Bjorn said, edging uphill as I got out my camera. \u201cLet\u2019s keep hiking, huh guys?\u201d\n\nI snapped a few pictures of Chip looking suitably dazed and happy and we continued up the ridge. From the meadow, it\u2019s about 20 or 30 minutes to the top of the ridge; we got to the top of Blackerby in a little less than two hours, at around 9:30 in the morning.\n\nI love ridge hikes. I imagine heaven as an alpine ridge on a sunny day: when your foot accidentally knocks into a patch of alpine heather, little white flowers shaped like bells go flying skywards. Mother rock ptarmigan and their chicks cling close to the ground, hoping you won\u2019t see them. Goats rest on patches of snow in the distance. You can see for dozens of miles; everything looks light-filled and transcendent.\n\nAll this beauty leads to a bit slower of a pace, however.\n\nWe hiked leisurely on, keeping an eye out for the first of what would be many goats.\n\nAround noon, we summited Cairn Peak, an exposed scramble at the end of the most traveled route along Blackerby Ridge.\n\nToward Cairn Peak, the blissful green of the ridge begins to turn rocky. Small bits of rock and dry dirt (even with all the rain) slide beneath your feet. We all became grateful for the poles we\u2019d brought; I clambered up some rocky places on all fours.\n\nAs we descended the peak, Bjorn began to look at his watch and requested I not take quite as many pictures of butterflies.\n\nObservation Peak has a few more solid slabs of rock than Cairn Peak, most of which are pretty grippy if you\u2019re wearing good shoes. It was still a bit of a scramble to get to the top; we stopped halfway up at the sight of more than a dozen mountain goats resting in a patch of snow.\n\nAfter a bit more scrambling and roughly 45 minutes, we were at the top of Observation Peak.\n\nTopping out at about 5,000 feet tall, this peak is one of those mountains you see from other mountains and wonder, sometimes, about hiking. I unequivocally recommend it; it was the best view I\u2019ve seen anywhere in Juneau besides the window seat of a plane. You can see the icefield stretch on for miles and Split Thumb, a well-known rock climbing location, looks closer than it is. Devil\u2019s Paw, one of the icefield\u2019s most recognizable mountains, was a blue outline in the distance. On the other side of Devil\u2019s Paw is Canada.\n\nAfter a few pictures, as much lingering as our timetable (goal: finish before midnight) could handle and an unexpectedly delicious meal of cold hot dogs, we began the descent to Salmon Ridge.\n\n\u201cWell, that looks like a pretty straight shot,\u201d Chip said, looking toward the Juneau Ridge.\n\n\u201cMm,\u201d Bjorn said. \u201cIt\u2019s trickier than it looks.\u201d\n\nAnd it was. Salmon Ridge is pretty rocky; it\u2019s also pretty up and down, without a clear trail.\n\nOn the descent from Observation Peak we accidentally got a bit off route and ended up lowering ourselves down a few cliff-ridden, overexposed places; even on the route, however, it can be a bit dicey.\n\nA few hours later our feet were getting sore. I was collecting snow from the few remaining snow patches and shoving it greedily in my mouth. In spite of the sunscreen we\u2019d used, we were all starting to turn red.\n\nChip gingerly touched the back of his neck. \u201cSunburn in Alaska,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you told me I\u2019d get sunburn here two days ago, I wouldn\u2019t have believed you.\u201d\n\nThen we - slowly - ascended the last mountain, part of the Juneau Ridge, and stared down into the green of Granite Creek Basin.\n\nIt was getting late in the day. I was beginning to greatly regret my decision to wear X-tra Tuffs on the (sometimes very muddy) hike. Chip was wearing hiking boots and even he got a blister, though, so maybe there is no perfect solution but a heavily calloused, impervious foot.\n\nAs we descended the basin, Bjorn ran ahead so he could bike back to the Blackerby trailhead and get our car.\n\nGranite Creek Basin was almost completely free of snow; we slid down a few areas, walked through low patches of fireweed along the creek banks, and got more than a little distracted by salmonberries. On the Perseverance Trail - which always seems like such a wide open relief after a hard hike - I pulled on my sandals, wrung out my sweaty socks, and we dodged the bikers, runners and dogs who passed us. By the time we reached the trailhead (at exactly the same moment Bjorn was driving up) it was more than 12 hours after we\u2019d started.\n\nI haven\u2019t been hiking as much as I\u2019d like this summer and found Observation Loop pretty difficult. According to a blog post from local hiker Betsy Fischer, the route has about 8,020 feet of elevation gain; I don\u2019t recommend it except for those who are quite fit and pretty good at finding their way around the outdoors.\n\nBut the view at the top of Observation is unparalleled, and there\u2019s something satisfying about an entire day spent thousands of feet up in the air. As a contributor to Operation Move to Alaska, Observation Loop wasn\u2019t too shabby. To use one of Bjorn\u2019s favorite phrases, Chip\u2019s soul may not yet be \u201chaunted by Alaska,\u201d but now we have lots of pictures of him in endless vistas; maybe soul-haunting is a long-term thing.\n\nEither way, I can\u2019t wait to hike Observation Loop again.\n\n___\n\nThe original story can be found on the Juneau Empire\u2019s website: http://bit.ly/1nAf53H\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Juneau (Alaska) Empire, http://www.juneauempire.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "Some Juneauites swear by their love of the rain.
