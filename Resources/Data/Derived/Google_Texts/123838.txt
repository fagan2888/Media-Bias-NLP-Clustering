For the tens of you wondering whether pickleball will be accepted as an Olympic sport, we have some crushing news. It's not happening in Sochi this year.

But the organizers at the Waukesha JanBoree aren't so prejudiced. "Pickleball, The next Olympic Sport?" is being presented at 12:30 p.m. Saturday at the Schuetze Recreation Center, 1120 E. Baxter St., Waukesha. Pickles aren't the pucks; it's a blend of tennis and pingpong, played on a badminton-size court, and anyone from 10 to 110 can supposedly learn to play.

It's just one of a series of events happening at the annual JanBoree, taking place Friday through Sunday about town. The opening ceremony at Lowell Park's Olympic Village, 2201 Michigan Ave., includes a live weather report by WTMJ-TV's John Malan, plus a toboggan run, curling and fireworks at 8 p.m.

Other activities throughout the weekend include an ice-sculpting contest, ice bowling, an ice-fishing clinic and ComedySportz performances. For more information, visit the Waukesha JanBoree website.
