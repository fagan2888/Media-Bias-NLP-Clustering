WASHINGTON (AP) â€” A do-not-drink order remains in effect for tap water in a section of northwest Washington due to contamination from a petroleum product that remains in the system.

More than 350 customers in the Shaw neighborhood north of downtown were ordered not to drink their water Wednesday afternoon after people noticed a petroleum smell. The order remains in effect Friday.

Three schools in the affected area were closed Thursday and Friday due to the water restriction. The schools are Cleveland, Garrison and Seaton elementary schools. Duke Ellington High School students are to report to the Meyer Campus.

D.C. Water crews have been working to flush the system for a second time to remove contaminants from the water. The system was flushed early Thursday, but tests indicated the water was still contaminated.
