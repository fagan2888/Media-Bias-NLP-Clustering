I think at first it was just about her eyes, the way they convey a certain combination of wisdom and boredom that always seemed out of sync with her age. Now, as she approaches 16, she somehow seems even further beyond her years. And it turns out my kid is the one who\u2019s teaching me how to grow old gracefully.\n\nI should mention that in many respects my daughter is a typical high schooler. Unlike her mother, she recognizes the music playing at H&M without having to ask Siri to identify it. She has conversations about people who are famous on Vine. She can read a text without holding her phone \u2014 a phone that does not have its brightness set to the highest possible level \u2014 at arm\u2019s length and squinting. To the outside world, she resembles \u201cUnbreakable Kimmy Schmidt\u2019s\u201d Xanthippe. In her heart, though, she\u2019s more Betty White. Last night she watched \u201cThe Proposal.\u201d Again.\n\nIn the past year, my daughter has dragged me to see \u201cIris\u201d and \u201cThe Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel,\u201d read the Grace Coddington memoir, and, after getting hooked on Netflix\u2019s \u201cGrace and Frankie,\u201d asked me in awe, \u201cDo you know about Lily Tomlin? She\u2019s incredible.\u201d After watching the Elaine Stritch documentary \u201cShoot Me,\u201d she changed her iPhone\u2019s lock screen wallpaper to an image of the late Broadway legend, scowling on a New York City street in an oversize fur coat and hat. She\u2019s lately been on an Angela Lansbury and Tina Turner kick. Her favorite Peggy Carter? Elderly Peggy Carter. When I asked her recently why she\u2019s so fascinated with older ladies, my daughter simply shrugged and replied, \u201cUh, because they\u2019re queens?\u201d\n\nMy child, admittedly, has the privilege of being a fangirl of the geriatric set while inhabiting an often more advantageous age group herself. Sure, she can\u2019t yet drive or vote, and rando dudes on the street love to order her to \u201cSmile, baby.\u201d But a large portion of the popular culture revolves around the tastes of her and her peers, and none of the products in her makeup case contain the word \u201cmature skin.\u201d It\u2019s possible that in 50 or 60 years \u2014 when, if she\u2019s lucky, she\u2019ll be a feisty old bird herself \u2014 she\u2019ll be less enchanted with the idea of being aged. Yet as one who is considerably closer to senior citizenship than she is, I find great inspiration in my daughter\u2019s frequent and sincere pronouncements of \u201cYou know who\u2019s a BAMF?
