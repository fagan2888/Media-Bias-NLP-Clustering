That money is part of the new GOP budget that was approved in the House on Wednesday now awaiting approval in the Senate.\n\nRelated: Boehner Finally Breaks the Colts to Get the House Budget Passed\n\nIn terms of belt tightening down the road, however, McCain and others have begun eyeing the military\u2019s gold-plated retirement and health care programs. With military health care and retirement costs skyrocketing, McCain says reforming the compensation system is unavoidable \u2013 and might actually attract more people into the military.\n\nThe cost of the military\u2019s generous 20-year retirement benefit and the TRICARE health insurance plan for active military members and their families and retirees has put a big squeeze on the Pentagon and its $521 billion annual base budget.\n\nLast year alone, DOD spent nearly $37 billion on retirees\u2019 pensions and health costs, or roughly seven percent of the total operating budget, according to the Office of Management and Budget. The DOD offers health care to nearly 10 million people including retirees through its TRICARE program, an integrated system of military health care providers and networks of civilian providers.\n\nIf the system is left unchecked, roughly one dollar of every $10 spent by the Pentagon in the coming decade will go for health care and retirement benefits, according to some projections.\n\nRelated: House and Senate Duke It Out Over Defense Spending\n\nThis helps explain why recommendations of a blue-ribbon commission to overhaul the military retirement system are gaining support \u2013 or intense interest \u2013 among lawmakers of both parties.\n\nIn January the Military Compensation and Retirement Modernization Commission issued a 300-page report proposing significant changes in the military\u2019s 20-year-or nothing retirement system and medical benefits for future members. The commission was headed by Alphonso Maldon, a former DOD assistant secretary on management and policy.\n\n\u201cWe believe we have taken the most comprehensive and holistic view of the pay and compensation programs, and looked at them in a way that has not been done before,\u201d Maldon said at a press conference.\n\nMany lawmakers, veterans lobbies and service members agree reforms are necessary, as Defense One notes in a major new report. Yet there\u2019s a reluctance to rush to change the system in the short run and risk being perceived as cutting benefits for active troops or inadvertently undermining the U.S.\u2019s all-volunteer military.\n\nRelated: DOD\u2019s $1B Redundant Health Program: GAO Says Scrap It\n\n\u201cThat was just a first step, so I can\u2019t draw any conclusions,\u201d McCain said early last month after presiding over a hearing to review the panel\u2019s report, as The Washington Times reported. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC), chair of the Armed Services Committee\u2019s personnel subcommittee, has said Congress must reform its pay and compensation system.\n\nCommission members say 15 key proposals could save DOD billions of dollars over the next several decades. Here are some of the most significant as noted by the commission:\n\nDismantle today\u2019s generous pension system that benefits military retirees with at least 20 years of service. Currently, qualified retirees receive a pension that is 50 percent of their base pay \u2013 which is far more than private sector workers receive even under a defined benefit system. In the future, DOD would offer a blended system that would decrease the annuity troops and officers receive after serving 20 years, but set up a 401(k)-like system that service members would pay into and the government would match.\n\nCurrently, the large percentage of personnel who serve less than 20 years before retiring do not qualify for a defined benefit, including those who have served multiple deployments. At the same time, many who rack up 20 or more years of service can retire in their 40s or 50s, draw a pension and find work elsewhere.\n\nRelated: One Injured Soldier of War Costs the U.S. $2 Million\n\nGrant the Secretary of Defense authority to change the service years required for retirement, either shortening or lengthening the f years required. Commission members believe DOD might be able to attract more talented people to serve if people who retire before hitting the 20-year mark can still qualify for some retirement benefits.\n\nReplace TRICARE with a \u201cselection of commercial insurance plans\u201d for family members, reserves and retirees not enrolled in TRICARE. Active duty service members would remain in the current health system. However, service members would receive a basic health care allowance to help pay for dependents\u2019 health care coverage. While family members would still have access to care in military hospitals and treatment centers, the reform would shift many of them to the private health insurance market.\n\nRequire DOD to provide more education and training to service members on better managing personal finances.\n\nImprove collaboration between DOD and Veterans Affairs by enforcing coordination on electronic medical records, transitions for service members and more.\n\nIncrease efficiency in the Reserves by consolidating 30 reserve component duty statuses into six broader statuses \u2013 and streamline the process of calling up reservists.\n\nRelated: 4 Best States for Military Retirees\n\nSunset duplicative GI bills and programs. Right now many programs overlap. Approved educational programs include graduate and undergraduate degrees, vocational and technical training, on-the-job training, flight training, entrepreneurship training and more. Beneficiaries receive up to 36 months of education benefits, which may be used for up to 15 years after separation from active duty.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The 114th Congress is gearing up to boost spending on the Pentagon in the c", "title": "How to Blast Billions from the DOD Budget", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/03/27/How-Blast-Billions-DOD-Budget", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/02092012_Defense_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/03/27/How-Blast-Billions-DOD-Budget", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/02092012_Defense_article.jpg", "creator": "@ericpianin", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "The 114th Congress is gearing up to boost spending on the Pentagon in the c", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcda59\"", "article_summary": "Approved educational programs include graduate and undergraduate degrees, vocational and technical training, on-the-job training, flight training, entrepreneurship training and more.\nHowever, service members would receive a basic health care allowance to help pay for dependents\u2019 health care coverage.\nImprove collaboration between DOD and Veterans Affairs by enforcing coordination on electronic medical records, transitions for service members and more.\nMany lawmakers, veterans lobbies and service members agree reforms are necessary, as Defense One notes in a major new report.\nThe DOD offers health care to nearly 10 million people including retirees through its TRICARE program, an integrated system of military health care providers and networks of civilian providers."}
