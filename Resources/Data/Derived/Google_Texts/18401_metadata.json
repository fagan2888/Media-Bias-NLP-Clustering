When it\u2019s being demonstrated for students, a laptop instead starts playing Lionel Richie\u2019s \u201cAll Night Long (All Night).\u201d\n\nAbout 16 percent of Americans are uninsured and surveys have shown many still know little or nothing about the health care law even though sign-ups for insurance have started. The challenge for the law\u2019s supporters is to connect with the millions of Americans who for whatever reason haven\u2019t paid attention.\n\nThe 18-month grant, to the Lear Center\u2019s Hollywood Health & Society program, will be used for briefings with staff from television shows and to track health overhaul-related depictions on prime-time and Spanish-language television.\n\nSince the grant money was provided so recently, no plot lines involving health care have been written. And Kaplan isn\u2019t targeting specific shows.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t believe the government alone can break through with those facts.\u201d Share:\n\nFor those who could benefit from coverage, \u201cwe want them to get the facts. We don\u2019t believe the government alone can break through with those facts,\u201d said David Zingale, a California Endowment senior vice president.\n\nThe grant announcement comes after the stumbling launch of the federal website where Americans shop for the health insurance they are required to have next year. The White House also has been forced to backtrack on vows that no one would lose their existing coverage and that anyone happy with their current insurance and doctor could keep them.\n\nArthur Caplan, head of the division of medical ethics at New York University\u2019s Langone Medical Center, said to have credibility, Hollywood must present the health care plan warts and all.\n\n\u201cIf there are drawbacks and glitches and discontent, that should be part of the presentations,\u201d said Caplan, who supports the law.\n\n\u201cIt should not be a place to propagandize; it should be a place to have honest open discussion, wrinkles and all, flaws and all, on health reform,\u201d he said. Critics of the law will be closely watching to see if \u201cHollywood might be airbrushing the president\u2019s core program, because they are close to the Democrats.\u201d\n\nHollywood can be a forceful shaper of style and public sentiment.\n\nA survey conducted several years ago for the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation found that among those who said their feelings toward gays and lesbians had become more favorable, many said a contributing factor was seeing more gay and lesbian characters on TV and in movies.\n\nVice President Joe Biden has credited the 1998-2006 TV sitcom \u201cWill & Grace,\u201d which featured a gay character, with doing \u201cmore to educate the public than almost anything anybody\u2019s done so far.\u201d\n\nZingale and Kaplan both stressed that the writers and producers remain solely in control of the content they create, with no strings from the endowment or the USC center, which select the health care experts and academics who will provide advice to them.\n\nOverall, the Los Angeles-based foundation expects to spend $130 million for advertisements and other enrollment efforts aimed largely at Hispanics. The foundation\u2019s president, Robert K. Ross, is a member of the board of Covered California, the state-run insurance exchange set up under the new law.\n\nThe center provides similar information for Hollywood writers on cancer, AIDS, climate change and other issues.\n\n\u201cPublic health is a common good. Public health is not a partisan issue,\u201d Kaplan said. \u201cAmerica needs to be healthy. People need to have access to health care. That\u2019s not a controversial statement.\u201d\n\nWilcox doesn\u2019t believe Hollywood can make the health care law successful.\n\n\u201cThe Bush White House wouldn\u2019t have asked \u2018Law and Order\u2019 to do a show defending the Patriot Act, because it wouldn\u2019t work,\u201d he said. \u201cIn my business, there is way too much reliance and investment in the power of creative communication. Because there is something more powerful than that, and that\u2019s people\u2019s personal experiences.\u201d\n\n\u2013", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30; polling-uri=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/1.xml; polling-uri2=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/2.xml; polling-uri3=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/3.xml; polling-uri4=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/4.xml", "application-name": "TheBlaze.com", "twitter": {"description": "Story by the Associated Press, curated by Oliver Darcy.  --  LOS ANGELES\u00a0(AP) \u2014 The health care overhaul might get a Hollywood rewrite.
