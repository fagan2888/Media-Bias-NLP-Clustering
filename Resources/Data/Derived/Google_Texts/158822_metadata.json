Hal Rogers joked about Obama setting a red line.\n\nHere is the video from C-SPAN:\n\nIn the video clip, Rep. Jim McGovern tries to warn the Republicans on the House Rules Committee that the votes aren\u2019t there, the Senate isn\u2019t going to take this up, and if it got to President Obama he would veto it. Rep. Hal Rogers (R-KY) asked, \u201cHe has threatened to veto?\u201d Rep. McGovern (D-MA) replied, \u201cHe hasn\u2019t threatened. He absolutely will veto.\u201d Rogers replied, \u201cHe\u2019s drawn a red line.\u201d This brought about much laughter from the Republican side.\n\nHouse Republicans would be wise to understand the lesson of the red line. Obama drew that red line on Syria, and then got exactly what he wanted.\n\nRepublicans are so delusional that they are laughing off the threat of a presidential veto. They really believe that they can bully Obama into killing his signature healthcare reform law. They don\u2019t believe that the president will stand firm. The laughter and jokes from Republicans suggest that they are celebrating shutting the government down. House Republicans are trying to spin what they are doing as an effort to keep the government open, but it is the exact opposite.\n\nHouse Republicans are giddily trying to shut the government down. Forty seven million Americans will no longer receive a paycheck if the government shuts down. Veterans will be hurt by limited or no access to veterans\u2019 services. House Republicans don\u2019t care that they are about to injure tens of millions of people. They are laughing while inflicting pain on millions of Americans.\n\nHouse Republicans may not believe it, but President Obama would veto their bill so fast that their heads would spin. They think they hold all of the cards, when they hold none. House Republicans are committing an act of economic hostage taking with a joke and smile. They appear to cluelessly believe that this time their failed tactics will work. House Republicans are counting on their 44th try to be the one that finally gets rid of Obamacare.\n\nYou can\u2019t fix stupid, and House Republicans are showing just how dumb they really are.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Watch delusional House Republicans literally laugh at President Obama's promise to veto their 44th attempt to get rid of the ACA.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "author": "Jason Easley", "og": {"site_name": "Politicus USA", "description": "Watch delusional House Republicans literally laugh at President Obama's promise to veto their 44th attempt to get rid of the ACA.", "title": "Delusional House Republicans Laugh at Obama's Promise to Veto Government Funding Bill", "url": "http://www.politicususa.com/2013/09/28/delusional-house-republicans-laugh-obamas-threat-veto-government-funding-bill.html", "image": "http://15130-presscdn-0-89.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/98162-95061.jpg", "updated_time": "2013-09-28T22:15:49+00:00", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 523732690, "app_id": 113462415332922, "pages": 186473214703370}, "keywords": "Featured News,Government Shutdown,government shutdown obama red line,hal rogers obama red line,house rules committee obama red line,obama red line,politicususa,liberal,politics,sarah jones,jason easley,barack obama,hillary clinton,bernie sanders,msnbc,media", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/PoliticusUSA", "section": "Featured News", "published_time": "2013-09-28T22:14:45+00:00", "modified_time": "2013-09-28T22:15:49+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Government Shutdown, government shutdown obama red line, hal rogers obama red line, house rules committee obama red line, obama red line"}, "article_summary": "Watch delusional House Republicans literally laugh at President Obama\u2019s promise to veto their 44th attempt to get rid of the ACA.\nHouse Republicans may not believe it, but President Obama would veto their bill so fast that their heads would spin.\nHouse Republicans are counting on their 44th try to be the one that finally gets rid of Obamacare.\nYou can\u2019t fix stupid, and House Republicans are showing just how dumb they really are.\nHe absolutely will veto.\u201d Rogers replied, \u201cHe\u2019s drawn a red line.\u201d This brought about much laughter from the Republican side."}
