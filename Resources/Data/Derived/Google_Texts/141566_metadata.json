Ad Policy\n\nLike many days, March 3 saw the delivery of a stern opinion by President Obama. To judge by recent developments in Ukraine, he said, Russia was putting itself\u201con the wrong side of history.\u201d This might seem a surprising thing for an American president to say. The fate of Soviet Communism taught many people to be wary of invoking History as if it were one\u2019s special friend or teammate. But Obama doubtless felt comfortable because he was quoting himself. \u201cTo those who cling to power through corruption and deceit and the silencing of dissent,\u201d he said in his 2009 inaugural address, \u201cknow that you are on the wrong side of history, but that we will extend a hand if you are willing to unclench your fist.\u201d In January 2009 and again in March 2014, Obama was speaking to the world as its uncrowned leader.\n\nFor some time now, observers\u2014a surprisingly wide range of them\u2014have been saying that Barack Obama seems more like a king than a president. Leave aside the fanatics who think he is a \u201ctyrant\u201d of unparalleled powers and malignant purpose. Notions of that sort come easily to those who look for them; they are predigested and can safely be dismissed. But the germ of a similar conclusion may be found in a perception shared by many others. Obama, it is said, takes himself to be something like a benevolent monarch\u2014a king in a mixed constitutional system, where the duties of the crown are largely ceremonial. He sees himself, in short, as the holder of a dignified office to whom Americans and others may feel naturally attuned.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.thumb": "http://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/obama_economy_rtr_img_0-275x173.jpg", "sailthru.author": "David Bromwich", "description": "Obama takes himself to be something like a benevolent monarch\u2014a king in a mixed constitutional system, where the duties of the crown are largely ceremonial.", "generator": "WooCommerce 2.3.13", "og": {"site_name": "The Nation", "description": "Obama takes himself to be something like a benevolent monarch\u2014a king in a mixed constitutional system, where the duties of the crown are largely ceremonial.", "title": "How Obama Became a Publicist for His Presidency", "url": "http://www.thenation.com/article/how-obama-became-publicist-his-presidency/", "image": {"width": 615, "identifier": "http://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/obama_economy_rtr_img_0.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "height": 379}, "updated_time": "2015-06-29T05:56:01+00:00", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Obama takes himself to be something like a benevolent monarch\u2014a king in a mixed constitutional system, where the duties of the crown are largely ceremonial.", "title": "How Obama Became a Publicist for His Presidency", "url": "http://www.thenation.com/article/how-obama-became-publicist-his-presidency/", "image": {"height": 379, "src": "http://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/obama_economy_rtr_img_0.jpg", "identifier": "http://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/obama_economy_rtr_img_0.jpg", "width": 615}, "site": "@TheNation", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "March 10th, 2014", "sailthru.title": "How Obama Became a Publicist for His Presidency", "keywords": "Barack Obama, president, legacy, speeches, Affordable Care Act, Leading from Behind, reputation, The Nation, David Bromwich", "fb": {"app_id": 192399944158735}, "sailthru.content_id": 89575, "sailthru.tags": "Political Figures,Politics,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheNationMagazine", "tag": "David Bromwich", "published_time": "2014-03-10T15:56:43+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-06-29T05:56:01+00:00", "author": "http://www.thenation.com/author/"}, "sailthru.description": "Obama takes himself to be something like a benevolent monarch\u2014a king in a mixed constitutional system, where the duties of the crown are largely ceremonial.", "sailthru.image.full": "http://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/obama_economy_rtr_img_0.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Ad PolicyLike many days, March 3 saw the delivery of a stern opinion by President Obama.\nFor some time now, observers\u2014a surprisingly wide range of them\u2014have been saying that Barack Obama seems more like a king than a president.\nObama, it is said, takes himself to be something like a benevolent monarch\u2014a king in a mixed constitutional system, where the duties of the crown are largely ceremonial.\nTo stay on top of important articles like these, sign up to receive the latest updates from TomDispatch.com.\nBut Obama doubtless felt comfortable because he was quoting himself."}
