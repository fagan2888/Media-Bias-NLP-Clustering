If you thought prices for drinks at your local bar are getting too high, you won’t believe how much they’re costing the U.S. economy.

Excessive alcohol use cost the country $249 billion in 2010, or $2.05 per drink, according to a new report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That’s up from $1.90 per drink in 2006.

That total reflects the combined cost of reduced workplace productivity, crime and health problems caused by excessive drinking. The organization said that binge drinking (consuming five or more drinks on one occasion for men, four or more for women) accounted for more than three-quarters of those costs.

Two out of every five dollars were paid by governments, with states spending a median $3.5 billion on alcohol-related problems, ranging from $488 million in North Dakota to $35 billion in California.

Per capita, alcohol-related problems cost states an average $807 per person, with Washington, D.C. having the highest per capita cost at $1,526.

“The increase in the costs of excessive drinking from 2006 to 2010 is concerning, particularly given the severe economic recession that occurred during these years,” Robert Brewer, CDC’s Alcohol Program head said in a statement. “Effective prevention strategies can reduce excessive drinking and related costs in states and communities, but they are under used.”

Researchers say that cost estimates may be low, since information on alcohol use is often underreported or unavailable. In addition to the financial toll, alcohol abuse leads to 88,000 deaths per year, including 1 in 10 deaths among working age Americans.
