CBS News correspondent Holly Williams says nearly 30,000 troops and allied militia members are on the ground, according to officials -- the biggest offensive since ISIS swept across northern Iraq last year. How much, if any role the U.S. will play is in question.\n\nOpening statements\n\nTwo dramatically different portraits of Boston Marathon bombings suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev are expected to emerge when prosecutors and Tsarnaev's lawyers give their opening statements at his federal death penalty trial. CBS News correspondent Elaine Quijano reports the trial, which begins today, is expected to be one of the most closely watched terror cases ever.\n\n\"IRS\" phone scam\n\nThere's a new alert about a massive scam involving criminals posing as IRS agents. The people behind the scam are calling at least 10,000 Americans every week, and federal investigators say they are absolutely ruthless. CBS News correspondent Chip Reid investigates the plot that's unfolding on your phone, only on \"CBS This Morning.\"\n\nFerguson report\n\nEven before Michael Brown was shot, the minority community of Ferguson, Missouri complained that they were racially profiled and harassed by local police. So for them, a Department of Justice review whose results are expected out today is vindication, reports CBS News correspondent Mark Strassmann. The DOJ investigation examined 35,000 pages of records from 2012 to 2014-- and the numbers are stark.\n\nUltrasound controversy\n\nThere may be no greater thrill than seeing your baby for the first time. Improving technology is giving people a much sharper view of a fetus, but as the images get clearer and 3-D, more and more women are going for so-called keepsake ultrasounds. Dr. Tara Narula reports on why that has some doctors and the FDA waving warning flags.\n\nObamacare in court\n\nShould the Supreme Court decide to throw out the Affordable Care Act's system of subsidies, it would be \"not just absurd, but catastrophic\" for health care in the U.S., Sen. Jeff Merkley, a Democrat from Oregon, warned. Obamacare supporters have not hesitated to predict the drastic consequences that could come from King v. Burwell, the case the Supreme Court considers today. Here are some of the possible outcomes.\n\nAffording retirement\n\nAmericans are anxious about their ability to live out their Golden Years with a measure of financial security. Those fears, unfortunately, are more than justified. With about 10,000 Americans retiring each day, a growing number are leaving the workforce without pensions, with modest Social Security benefits or inadequate individual account balances. Factor in skyrocketing healthcare costs and the picture becomes even more alarming. But that is just the beginning.\n\nHyper \"seeing\"\n\nMethane leaks are bad for the environment. They're also bad for business -- unless your job is to find them. The colorless gas leaks are often hard to find, but now a high tech device originally used on microscopes is finding chemicals in the air just by \"looking.\"\n\nFighting tweeters\n\nFormer star pitcher Curt Schilling is considering taking legal action against people who tweeted vulgar comments about his daughter. It started last week when Schilling, a proud father, sent a tweet congratulating his daughter on being accepted to Salve Regina University, where she'll play softball. Then that tweet got unexpected reactions.\n\nBetter pizza?\n\nRestaurateur Danny Meyer has been re-inventing foods Americans know and love for more than 30 years. He recently went public with his burger joint, Shake Shack and now, CBS News correspondent Jim Axelrod reports, Meyer has turned his attention to pizza at Marta, taking the humble pie to a whole new level.\n\nTop News\n\nWorld\n\nHow will Netanyahu's speech play in Israel?\n\nReport: #TheDress creator faced child labor allegations\n\nIndia orders TV stations not to give gang rapist a platform\n\nThe most endangered animal you've never heard of\n\nPolitics\n\nAlabama Supreme Court halts same-sex marriage\n\nHouse votes to fund DHS through September\n\nU.S.\n\nHeroin killing new types of victims\n\nSuspect held in shootings near NSA\n\nJury at impasse on Jodi Arias sentence; judge says keep going\n\nMoneyWatch\n\nThe top 5 overseas retirement havens for Americans\n\nAsiana plane crash victims reach settlements\n\nHealth\n\nSimple tips to help you \"spring forward\" smoothly to daylight saving time\n\n\"Am I normal?\" New study on penis size has answers for men\n\nBoston Babies buzzing on coffee", "article_metadata": {"description": "Day 3 of battle to retake key Iraq town from ISIS; trial starting for Boston Marathon bombings suspect; fake IRS reps engaging in massive phone scam", "og": {"url": "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/this-morning-from-cbs-news-march-4-2015/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2015/03/04/ee489808-2104-4432-bdeb-24d727352d1c/thumbnail/1200x630/8f68fc612e8af2a7a5ed3e9066da2d75/2015-03-04t114410z545315242gm1eb341i1c01rtrmadp3mideast-crisis-iraq.jpg", "height": 630}, "type": "article", "description": "Day 3 of battle to retake key Iraq town from ISIS; trial starting for Boston Marathon bombings suspect; fake IRS reps engaging in massive phone scam", "title": "This Morning from CBS News, March 4, 2015"}, "twitter": {"description": "Day 3 of battle to retake key Iraq town from ISIS; trial starting for Boston Marathon bombings suspect; fake IRS reps engaging in massive phone scam", "title": "This Morning from CBS News, March 4, 2015", "app": {"url": {"ipad": "cbsnewsapp://news/this-morning-from-cbs-news-march-4-2015/", "iphone": "cbsnewsapp://news/this-morning-from-cbs-news-march-4-2015/", "googleplay": "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/this-morning-from-cbs-news-march-4-2015/"}, "country": "US", "name": {"ipad": "CBS News", "iphone": "CBS News", "googleplay": "CBS News"}, "id": {"ipad": 334256223, "iphone": 334256223, "googleplay": "com.treemolabs.apps.cbsnews"}}, "site": "@CBSNews", "image": "http://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2015/03/04/ee489808-2104-4432-bdeb-24d727352d1c/thumbnail/1200x630/8f68fc612e8af2a7a5ed3e9066da2d75/2015-03-04t114410z545315242gm1eb341i1c01rtrmadp3mideast-crisis-iraq.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "index, follow", "al": {"web": {"url": "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/this-morning-from-cbs-news-march-4-2015/"}, "android": {"app_name": "CBS News", "package": "com.treemolabs.apps.cbsnews"}, "ios": {"url": "cbsnewsapp://news/this-morning-from-cbs-news-march-4-2015/", "app_name": "CBS News", "app_store_id": 334256223}}, "fb": {"app_id": 1536620209892267}, "keywords": "ferguson, shiite, boston marathon bombing, isis, michael brown, tikrit, iraq", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/CBSNews"}, "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "ferguson, shiite, boston marathon bombing, isis, michael brown, tikrit, iraq"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf308\"", "article_summary": "CBS News correspondent Chip Reid investigates the plot that's unfolding on your phone, only on \"CBS This Morning.\"\nSo for them, a Department of Justice review whose results are expected out today is vindication, reports CBS News correspondent Mark Strassmann.\nCBS News correspondent Elaine Quijano reports the trial, which begins today, is expected to be one of the most closely watched terror cases ever.\nObamacare supporters have not hesitated to predict the drastic consequences that could come from King v.
