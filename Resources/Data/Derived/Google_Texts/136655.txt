“Crossfire” is no longer, in Jon Stewart’s famous formulation, “hurting America.” It’s not doing much of anything to help, either.

Mediabistro reported that the show has been airing sporadically all year, most recently going on hiatus since mid-July. This is fairly befuddling, given the effort CNN expended in hiring at least one high-profile co-host, in the person of former House speaker Newt Gingrich, and the historic nature of the brand; “Crossfire” had, until its 2005 cancellation, been one of the news network’s iconic brands.

As the show’s been off-air, S.E. Cupp — the show’s conservative co-host who hasn’t run for president — has been in demand, appearing on “The View” in what may well be quasi-auditions for a new right-leaning panelist, and writing for the New York Daily News, most recently about how Jennifer Lawrence and other female celebrities ought not to have taken nude pictures of themselves if they didn’t want them leaked.

This is why no one misses “Crossfire” when it’s not on — because its hosts have nothing to say. A show in which hosts debate the issues of the day from differing perspectives could, if done well, be a hugely valuable asset to a news channel especially in a political landscape wracked by contentious issues (Ferguson, ISIS). That presumes, though, that its hosts would be able to keep their eye on the ball and avoid small-bore polemics, things that Cupp, as evidenced by her Daily News writing, is unable to do.
