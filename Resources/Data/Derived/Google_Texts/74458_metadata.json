It\u2019s what the researchers called \"entry-level\" flirting and, while teens of varying dating experience use the tactic, 37% of teens with no dating experience friended someone or sent funny things to a crush (31%) to initiate contact. Teens with dating experience, meanwhile, were more likely to send flirtatious messages (63%) or flirty/sexy videos and photos (23%). Of the teens with dating experience, 69% said putting the relationship on social media allowed too many people to see what is going on.\n\n\n\nOverall, teens preferred other methods to keep in touch with romantic partners: texting (92%), talking on the phone (87%), and being together in person (86%) all exceeded social media communication (70%), while messaging apps (49%), email (37%), and chatting during video game play (31%) are less popular.\n\n\n\nLawrence Steinberg, PhD, Distinguished University Professor of Psychology at Temple University, stated, \"I think a lot of adults today have unnecessary worries about the ways in which social media are disrupting adolescents' emotional development. And I think social media are - they're not the evil that, really, people think of them as.\"\n\n\n\nA separate study, published in Cyberpsychology, Behavior, and Social Networking in July 2015, found that students who spent more than two hours a day on social media \"were more likely to report distress, poor mental health and even suicidal thoughts.\"\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "social networking, social networking quotes, social media quotes, social media research, social networking pew", "description": "Article on social networking by teens and new study from Pew Research", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, minimum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "And I think social media are - they're not the evil that, really, people think of them as.\"\n50% of teens have friended someone on social media (primarily Facebook) to indicate romantic interest.\nTeens with dating experience, meanwhile, were more likely to send flirtatious messages (63%) or flirty/sexy videos and photos (23%).\nOf the teens with dating experience, 69% said putting the relationship on social media allowed too many people to see what is going on.\nIt\u2019s what the researchers called \"entry-level\" flirting and, while teens of varying dating experience use the tactic, 37% of teens with no dating experience friended someone or sent funny things to a crush (31%) to initiate contact."}
