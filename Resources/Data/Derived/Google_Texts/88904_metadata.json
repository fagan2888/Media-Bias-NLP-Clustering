Police said her death appears to be a domestic incident. She was a mother of two.\n\nOfficers responded to a call around 2:30 a.m. Jan. 1 to find the suspect sitting on the porch of the home. They observed several shell casings around Nolen's body on the scene.\n\nNolen and the man who police believe shot her were in a relationship, but it's unclear if he was her husband or boyfriend. Neighbors said they had lived together for awhile, but they saw Nolen move out of the house late last year.\n\nPolice say that their preliminary investigation reveals that the suspect called a witness and told her that Nolen would not leave the house. He called the witness again saying that he shot Nolen by mistake.\n\nThe suspect is currently in custody on a 48-hour hold. His name has not yet been released and he has not yet been charged.\n\nPolice have not released any other details about the case.\n\nAnnetta Nunn, who is a domestic violence court advocate for the YWCA, says when it comes to domestic violence, it is one of the few crimes that can be prevented, if victims feel empowered to speak up about it.\n\nShe said sometimes having a helpful hand from a friend or loved one can give them the strength they need to speak out.\n\n\"The campaign that's going on with Homeland Security, \u2018See Something-Say Something,\u2019 it's the same with your personal homeland. If you see something, say something. Friends and neighbors, you may not necessarily have to call police. But if you could just say something to the individual about what you're noticing and your concern for them--that if you need help, here's someone who can help you and give them the hotline number--you can't make them call, you can't make them accept help, but at least you can give them the information that will hopefully help them make a better choice,\u201d Nunn said.\n\nNunn said if anyone would like a presentation on domestic awareness, in which they know the signs to look out for, they can contact her at the YWCA.\n\nAlso, if you know someone who is in need of help right now, these are couple of hotline numbers:\n\nHere in Birmingham, the number is: 205-322-4878\n\nThe statewide number is: 1-800-650-6522\n\nPolice are asking anyone with information about the case to call the BPD Homicide Unit at 205-254-1764.\n\nCopyright 2016 WBRC.
