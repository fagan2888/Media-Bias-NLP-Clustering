Another definition is simply to make the targeted law \u201cof no value or consequence.\u201d\n\n\u201cOne might be tempted to think that there is no way to nullify without ending the force of something in law,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIn other words, without a legislative body repealing the law, or a judge striking it down, it will still remain in full effect. But this certainly isn\u2019t always the case.\u201d\n\nAfter all, alcohol prohibition was repealed by lawmakers to end America\u2019s failed attempt at being a dry nation.\n\nBut that was after it was \u201creduced to a virtually unenforceable decree in much of the country for many reasons, including mass individual disregard of the law, along with a refusal by states to assist in its enforcement.\u201d\n\nBoldin notes that James Madison addressed the issue of the federal government enacting a measure that states found unacceptable.\n\n\u201cShould an unwarranted measure of the federal government be unpopular in particular states, which would seldom fail to be the case, or even a warrantable measure be so, which may sometimes be the case, the means of opposition to it are powerful and at hand,\u201d Madison wrote. \u201cThe disquietude of the people; their repugnance and, perhaps, refusal to cooperate with officers of the union, the frowns of the executive magistracy of the state; the embarrassment created by legislative devices, which would often be added on such occasions, would pose, in any state, very serious impediments; and were the sentiments of several adjoining states happen to be in union, would present obstructions which the federal government would hardly be winning to encounter.\u201d\n\nOne of the high-profile disputes now is marijuana. It remains illegal under federal law, but 19 states have legalized it for medical use. Colorado, Washington state, Oregon and Alaska also have legalized it for recreational use.\n\nThe federal government has made no serious effort to address the discrepency.\n\n\u201cWe saw the market for marijuana significantly expand in three states this year,\u201d the report said. \u201cThis is perhaps the most important development in the nullification of federal prohibition. By removing barriers at the state level, more people will feel comfortable participating in the market. As it expands, the feds become increasingly powerless to stop it with their limited resources.\u201d\n\nIn the first week of limited retail sales in Oregon, dispensaries sold a staggering $11 million worth of marijuana \u2013 more than double the numbers from Colorado\u2019s first week \u2013 \u201cproving state laws legalizing cannabis truly do nullify federal prohibition in practice.\u201d\n\nIn Texas, lawmakers tired of the variations of the money markets voted to set up a state gold depository.\n\nIn the controversial Common Core educational mandate, states \u201ccan nullify\u201d it \u201csimply by withdrawing from the program,\u201d the report said.\n\n\u201cIn Oregon, Gov. Kate Brown signed a bill that allows parents to opt their children out of Common Core testing for any reasons for at least the next six years,\u201d the report said.\n\nThe center reports that nullification has moved from being a \u201cfringe political theory\u201d into the mainstream. Just this year, \u201cstate legislators across the country introduced close to 400 bills drafted to reject, or simply ignore, federal authority covering nearly a dozen issues.\u201d\n\nAs a result, dozens of bills became law.\n\n\u201cWhen we call the nullification movement revolutionary, we don\u2019t mean it in the stereotypical sense. We\u2019re not talking about people running around with guns and pitchforks,\u201d said the Tenth Amendment Center\u2019s national communications director, Mike Maharrey. \u201cThis is a deeper, more philosophical revolution \u2013 a revolution in thought.\u201d\n\nGet \u201cTaking America Back,\u201d Joseph Farah\u2019s manifesto for sovereignty, self-reliance and moral renewal\n\nIt\u2019s not exactly new.\n\nOne of the classic examples is slavery. Southern states adopted slave repatriation laws requiring people to ship escaping slaves back to their masters. Northern states banned the requirement.\n\n\u201cThose laws didn\u2019t legally end the fugative slave acts, but they did make them nearly impossible to enforce,\u201d the group said in a prepared statement.\n\nOther issues that states have moved forward in defiance of federal demands are the access by patients to experimental drugs, protection against surveillance and electronic monitors.\n\nAnother significant issue is the weaponization of local police forces. The feds simply transfer ownership of military grade weapons from the military to local police forces.\n\nCommunities are responding with new laws against police departments accepting any weapons or requiring local governmental bodies to approve them before the transfers can happen.\n\nIt\u2019s not the first time the trend has been noticed.\n\nAt the beginning of the 2015 state legislative season, the Tenth Amendment Center cited hundreds of bills that would put limits on Washington.\n\n\u201cSponsored by both Democrats and Republicans, these bills range from narrowly focused legislation that would allow terminally ill people access to experimental drugs and medical treatments despite FDA regulations, to bills that would deny resources and assistance from states to the NSA. Other legislation addresses the Second Amendment, the federal prohibition of hemp and marijuana, Common Core, the use of drones for surveillance, the Affordable Care Act, and even federal grant programs that arm local police with battlefield-ready military equipment,\u201d the center said.\n\nBoldin has explained that a key component of the movement is the recognized principle that the federal government cannot force states to expend resources or manpower to do its work.\n\nAlready, 39 states have passed various laws attempting to exempt themselves from implementing Obamacare.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Free Press For A Free People Since 1997", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.1", "og": {"site_name": "WND", "description": "Hemp is used around the world for ropes and cords, clothing, paints, cooking and plastics.
