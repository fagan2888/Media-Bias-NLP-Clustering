The case has the potential to end federal insurance subsidies for some 7.5 million people in 34 states.\n\nUntil now, the 31-year-old think tank was probably best known as a strident critic of what it calls \u201cglobal warming alarmism.\u201d It has also been a ceaseless advocate for small government and free markets and has played what the conservative entrepreneur Steve Forbes called \u201ca critical role in preventing the worst of the left\u2019s utopian nightmares from becoming reality.\u201d\n\nBut beyond its research reports and policy papers, the Competitive Enterprise Institute has a litigious side, and it has teamed up with state attorneys general to challenge an array of Obama administration regulations on financial, air-quality and other issues.\n\nThe Competitive Enterprise Institute sees itself not as a think tank, but as a \u201cdo tank,\u201d committed to changing federal policies rather than just analyzing them, said William Yeatman, a senior fellow at the group.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nChallenging the law known as Obamacare seemed like a \u201cnatural fit,\u201d the institute declared on its website, because the measure \u201cthreatens the rule of law\u201d and has harmed \u201cmillion of Americans\u201d through lost health plans and higher premiums.\n\nSupporters of the health care law dismiss the group\u2019s claims as overwrought and unsubstantiated. But the institute has now made it to the Supreme Court by seizing on four words in the law \u2014 regarding tax credits for an insurance marketplace \u201ccreated by the state\u201d \u2014 and using them to challenge the very underpinnings of President Obama\u2019s signature health care achievement. The group worked to organize legal challenges, found four Virginia residents to serve as plaintiffs, and financed the litigation through the courts.\n\n\u201cWhile the case involves only a handful of plaintiffs, it is really about the millions of Americans who are victims of Obamacare\u2019s mandates and penalties,\u201d Sam Kazman, the group\u2019s general counsel and a staunch opponent of government regulation, wrote in an op-ed article this week in USA Today.\n\nThe institute declined to say how much it is spending to bring the case to court, but it said the money is coming from its general budget, not from a single source. Its positions are \u201cdeveloped independently and are not influenced by the views of donors,\u201d the group said.\n\nThose donors include the much-better-known foundations created by the conservative billionaires Charles G. and David H. Koch, as well as other conservative groups like Dunn\u2019s Foundation for the Advancement of Right Thinking in Florida and the Sarah Scaife Foundation in Pittsburgh, according to tax records and other reports.\n\nThe donors also include the foundations of Exxon Mobil, General Motors, Verizon and many other major corporations. The group received a total of $5.4 million in grants and contributions in 2013, according to its most recent publicly disclosed audit.\n\nAt a conservative gathering in Washington in 2010, Michael S. Greve, who was then the think tank\u2019s chairman and remains on the board, uttered an attack on the health care law so vitriolic that it has now become almost legend among the measure\u2019s opponents.\n\n\u201cThis bastard has to be killed as a matter of political hygiene,\u201d Mr. Greve declared. \u201cI do not care how this is done, whether it\u2019s dismembered, whether we drive a stake through its heart, whether we tar and feather it and drive it out of town, whether we strangle it.\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday, his group had its chance.\n\n\u201cThis is one of those things that is truly darned good about this country: You can have a big brawl where people really disagree vehemently, but at the end of the day you have nine lawyers who are really damned good lawyers and will sort all this out for the country,\u201d Mr. Greve, a law professor at George Mason University, said in a telephone interview.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nFor his group, however, Mr. Greve sees the case as a bit of a \u201cmixed blessing.\u201d\n\n\u201cObviously, this is a huge thing for C.E.I., and it sort of helps with name identification and donors and all the rest of it,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it also has the effect that the entire institution becomes in the public mind identified with this one big case, and that\u2019s something you need to fight a little.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20150304081947, "twitter": {"description": "The Competitive Enterprise Institute, with ties to conservative titans like the Koch brothers,
