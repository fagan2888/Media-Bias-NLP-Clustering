The aim, though, is to get women to share the kind of honest, uncensored personal stories that are too often ignored in our sex-saturated culture.\n\nDo Tell is the brainchild of Melissa Tapper Goldman and a virtual continuation of her documentary \u201cSubjectified: Nine Women Talk About Sex.\u201d Both projects are concerned with what Tapper Goldman calls \u201cthe cost of shame\u201d \u2014 in other words, the harm that is done by stigmatizing women\u2019s sexual experiences and encouraging silence. The stories that have been published thus far on Do Tell show the vast range of women\u2019s experiences. \u201cAn explosive orgasm?\u201d asks a 23-year-old woman from Massachusetts. \u201cMaybe I\u2019ve gotten it once from a guy, but mostly I can only give them to myself.\u201d \u201cK.S.\u201d from Minnesota writes, \u201cHe took the time to really feel and understand my body, giving me the most numbing and mind-blowing orgasms I had ever had at the point (my body literally went numb from the pleasure).\u201d There are a disproportionate number of tales about sexual pain and abuse: \u201cI was molested at 12 by a friend\u2019s older brother,\u201d writes \u201cC,\u201d a 42-year-old from Chicago. \u201cI didn\u2019t understand it to be sex, just weird that he would hold me on his lap and tickle me.\u201d\n\nI spoke with Tapper Goldman about how \u201cshame causes cancer,\u201d the impact of sexual silence on men and where to draw the line between honesty and over-sharing.\n\nSo what exactly is \u201cthe cost of shame\u201d?\n\nIt\u2019s not a surprise that sex in American culture is associated with shame and stigma. But in my work, I\u2019ve found that we\u2019re slow to acknowledge the real, direct toll this takes on our lives. Silence is not just an absence of input \u2014 it actually creates an environment of shame. We cultivate stigma when we avoid the topic of sex. So we find ourselves in a strange position where sexuality is part of all of our lives, it\u2019s all over pop culture and media. But at the same time, authentic, diverse expressions of real sexuality, particularly women\u2019s, are nowhere to be found in media. When we\u2019re so pointedly not talking about sex in our own lives, those skewed media depictions take on even more influence. It\u2019s like if all we knew about lunch was what we learned in Subway ads.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to be a feminist, or even a woman, to care about the cost of shame \u2014 this is an issue that directly impacts anyone who has sex or thinks about sex or might someday have sex. So what do we lose when we can\u2019t talk about sex openly? For one, shame gets in the way of actually enjoying our sex lives, which I feel totally indignant about. But there are other more lethal costs, like so many women not believing that their experiences or health or even consent really matter to other people. How comfortable do we make it for an 18-year-old in Mississippi to ask her doctor for birth control or her pharmacist for Plan B if she chooses to have sex? A friend of mine in her late 20s asked me to accompany her to a cervical biopsy after a nurse made her feel humiliated for having contracted a sexually transmitted infection. And we wonder why pap smear follow-up rates are under 50 percent! At that point, it\u2019s not a stretch to say that shame causes cancer.\n\nOne of my best friends was raped by an ex-boyfriend when she was 17. She had no idea how to talk to me about it, and I had no idea how to really listen or support her. To this day, I\u2019m horrified to think that my reaction added to her feeling of shame and isolation. Bearing in mind the staggering statistic of one in four women raped in her lifetime, how many rape survivors feel comfortable talking about their experiences or seeking much-needed support? Sex and rape are most definitely not the same thing, but the shame that many people experience after rape, that\u2019s our sex stigma in action.\n\nLuckily, it just doesn\u2019t have to be this way. We can make another choice to be open about sexuality in our relationships, romantic and platonic. That\u2019s true for people who are sexually active as well as those who choose not to be. Speaking up about sex in all its complexity is one of the few effective ways to push back against the cruel and unfair expectation of silence. That\u2019s why I made \u201cSubjectified\u201d and why I recently created Do Tell.\n\nIs this something women disproportionately face? How does it impact men?\n\nWell if women aren\u2019t having good sex, then it definitely does impact most men! It\u2019s absolutely true that men are shamed and silenced about their sexuality as well. But when women are expected to look pleasing and sexy, to be sexually available for other people\u2019s pleasure, we receive a very direct messages that our value as people is tied to our sexuality. Our entire identities get bound up with our sexuality in many different ways. So that\u2019s an intense and important thing to feel that you can\u2019t talk about. Women are specifically punished for speaking up, even for just describing our basic life experiences. If a woman talks about her sex life, or her birth control, or a rape or abortion, she runs the risk of losing relationships, people\u2019s respect for her, even her job.\n\nOne unexpected reaction to \u201cSubjectified\u201d is that men have particularly appreciated having the topic broached. Many desperately want information about their partners\u2019 experiences \u2014 what gives them pleasure or what emotional setbacks they are dealing with \u2014 but these men can\u2019t seem to get answers from the women they\u2019re sleeping with. Maybe they\u2019re asking the wrong questions or they don\u2019t know how to start a conversation that feels safe to their partners. But many women are really terrified to talk about these things \u2014 sometimes with good reason, given the repercussions women can face for speaking up. It\u2019s a lot of pressure to work this all out within that one sexual relationship rather than as a lifelong series of conversations with trusted friends and lovers. So men also suffer because of the shame we put on women. If they love and respect the women in their lives, they\u2019re suffering. But the consequences of silencing are much more severe for some than others: women are hurt by this disproportionately, as are people of color, queer and gender-noncomforming people, and those without the resources to obtain appropriate reproductive healthcare.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A new blog encourages women to share stories about their sexuality in hopes of making sex better for everyone", "author": "Tracy Clark-Flory", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "A new blog encourages women to share stories about their sexuality in hopes of making sex better for everyone", "title": "The cost of sexual shame", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2013/11/10/the_cost_of_sexual_shame/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/11/woman_shame.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A new blog encourages women to share stories about their sexuality in hopes of making sex better for everyone", "creator": "@TracyClarkFlory", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/11/woman_shame.jpg", "title": "The cost of sexual shame", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "The cost of sexual shame", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Do Tell, Editor's Picks, Love and Sex, Sex", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf690\"", "article_summary": "For one, shame gets in the way of actually enjoying our sex lives, which I feel totally indignant about.\nSo what exactly is \u201cthe cost of shame\u201d?\nIt\u2019s not a surprise that sex in American culture is associated with shame and stigma.\nSex and rape are most definitely not the same thing, but the shame that many people experience after rape, that\u2019s our sex stigma in action.\nSo men also suffer because of the shame we put on women."}
