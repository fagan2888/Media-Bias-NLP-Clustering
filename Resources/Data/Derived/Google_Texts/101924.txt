Singer and actress Jennifer Hudson is a fan of Obamacare and the TV show “Scandal“–so she shot a humorous video for the website “Funny or Die” that’s a mash-up of both.

At a screening last night in New York City of her new drama “The Inevitable Defeat of Mister and Pete,” Hudson told Speakeasy her aim in making the clip was to help promote awareness about Obamacare aka the Affordable Care Act.

So what does she think about the government shutdown in the wake of Republican efforts to defund Obamacare?

“I just hope they come to a deal,” Hudson said.

“The Inevitable Defeat of Mister and Pete” opens on Oct 11.
