More on this Star Wars: The Force Awakens at Marbles IMAX theater

"Star Wars: The Force Awakens" doesn't open until Dec. 17, but ticket sales to see the movie at Marbles IMAX Theatre are going fast.

As of late last week, 17 of the 22 opening weekend show times are sold out. Another has limited availability.

Marbles IMAX will run the new release for 33 continuous hours beginning at 7 p.m. on Dec. 17. Tickets are currently available for showtimes through Jan. 3 on Marbles' website. The movie will be on screen through late January.



Select scenes from "Star Wars: The Force Awakens" were filmed with IMAX cameras, providing IMAX moviegoers with 26 percent more of the image than standard theaters, Marbles tells me. In addition, Marbles will provide a unique Star Wars-themed lobby experience for guests who are sure to line up early.
