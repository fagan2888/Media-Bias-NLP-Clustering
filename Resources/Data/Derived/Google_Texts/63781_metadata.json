Rep. Lucille Roybal-Allard, D-CA, recalls that lawmakers understood the gravity of the situation but feared the political blowback.\n\n\u201cThat was always a concern of mine: How to address the issue in a way that did not detract from the need for comprehensive immigration reform,\u201d Roybal-Allard said.\n\nAnother anonymous source, this one with access to White House internal deliberations, told the Post that the Obama administration wanted to focus on overarching reform rather than an immediate solution.\n\n\u201cWas the White House told there were huge flows of Central Americans coming?

In April 2012, Texas Gov. Rick Perry urged Obama \u201cto take immediate action\u201d and return unaccompanied minors to their home countries.\n\nIn an open letter to Obama, the Republican governor warned that \u201cevery child allowed to remain encourages hundreds more to attempt the journey.\u201d\n\nThe Washington Post reports that Health and Human Services\u2019 Office of Refugee Resettlement budget ballooned from $149 million in 2011 to $376 million in 2013, as the number of unaccompanied minors spiked from 3,933 to 20,805 in the same time.\n\nEarlier this month, Obama asked Congress to approve an emergency funding package to address the issue. Republicans contend the president\u2019s proposal lacks border security measures.\n\n>>> Full Washington Post infographic (read related article)", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Obama administration knew of the impending crisis on the U.S.\u2013Mexico border as early as 2012 but chose to ignore the warning signs.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The Obama administration knew of the impending crisis on the U.S.\u2013Mexico border as early as 2012 but chose to ignore the warning signs.", "title": "Did White House Ignore Border Crisis Until It Was Too Late?", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/WashPostInfo-crop.jpg", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/Wse2gn"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The Obama administration knew of the impending crisis on the U.S.\u2013Mexico border as early as 2012 but chose to ignore the warning signs.", "creator": "@dailysignal", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/WashPostInfo-crop.jpg"}, "title": "Did White House Ignore Border Crisis Until It Was Too Late?", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Security", "tag": "immigration", "published_time": "2014-07-21T15:36:27+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Report: White House Ignored Warnings of Border Crisis Until It Was Too Late,"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd84a5\"", "article_summary": "Yes, that\u2019s where the focus was.\u2019\u2019>>> Commentary: Throwing Money at Border Crisis Won\u2019t Solve ProblemsMeanwhile, a host of politicians, advocacy groups, and faith initiatives continued to decry federal inaction.\n>>> Full Washington Post infographic (read related article)\n\u201cWas the White House told there were huge flows of Central Americans coming?\n>>> This Is Exactly How Central Americans Illegally Cross the Mexico-Texas BorderThe looming immigration crisis was developing as Obama campaigned for a second term.\nAnother anonymous source, this one with access to White House internal deliberations, told the Post that the Obama administration wanted to focus on overarching reform rather than an immediate solution."}
