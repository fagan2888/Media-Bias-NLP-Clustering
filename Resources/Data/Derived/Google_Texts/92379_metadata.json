They tell me that she is an angel now. They tell me that she\u2019s with God. But as an atheist, these words have never brought me any comfort.\n\nMy daughter was born three years ago. I went into pre-term labor at 22 weeks gestation, and try as they might, the doctors could not keep her here with us. Her short life, just eight hours long, has marked my life and my husband\u2019s life deeply. Margaret Hope (or Maggie, as we refer to her) continues to exist with us in her own way, but this persistence has absolutely nothing to do with god or Jesus or angels or any other specific afterworld. This is what works for us as parents. It\u2019s what works for about two percent of the U.S. population who currently identify as atheists, and for about 20 percent who are agnostic or unaffiliated with any particular set of beliefs.\n\nBeing an atheist in a believer\u2019s world can be difficult at times, especially when some of the more fervently religious are close family or friends. It\u2019s even more daunting when faced with grief and death. Christians believe that when we die, we either go to heaven or hell. Many, of course, believe babies go to heaven because they are, well, babies. When our daughter died, my husband requested to have our baby baptized, fearing in some way for her soul, a remnant of his Catholic upbringing. There was no time for a traditional baptism while she was alive but her NICU doctor performed the rite for her while we held her in our arms for the first time, our tiny, frail, lifeless daughter whose eyes never even got a chance to see. It felt bizarre to me, but I allowed it because my husband was suffering and it seemed to bring him some comfort. Later, as reality hit harder, he would lose all faith as I had done.\n\nAfter we left the hospital, we were faced with the task of whether or not to hold some sort of memorial service for Maggie. Part of me wanted to go to the Unitarian Universalist church, as that is the only place I\u2019d been where I felt like my agnostic views were still respected, where I could still enjoy some semblance of spirituality while remaining non-religious. At the time, however, I was an emotional mess and could not do much to contact anyone or even make any suggestions.\n\nFortunately, my brother stepped up and arranged a service at a church in Miami Beach (where Maggie \u201clived\u201d for most of her brief life). While it was technically a Christian church, the fact that they were supportive of the LGBTQA community, plus their commitment to serving the homeless made me feel like this was a place I would be comfortable bringing my daughter, even after death. In a small, cosmic joke, we also appreciated the fact that the pastor was named \u201cHunter\u201d Thompson.\n\nThose around us did their best to offer words of comfort, but after a while, I became tired and even resentful of the comments about my daughter needing to go be with Jesus. Worse still, I isolated myself so I wouldn\u2019t need to hear their \u201ccomforting\u201d words because all they did was make me feel worse. Like so many other non-believers, I cannot wrap my head around the idea that there is some supreme being that allows these sorts of things to happen, commands them to happen. Being a bereaved parent is hard enough, but being one when you don\u2019t believe in god is something else altogether.\n\nThe thing is, though, if you tell someone of faith that you don\u2019t believe your child is in heaven, you\u2019re met with confusion, or sad looks, or sometimes even a bit of anger. People don\u2019t understand how or why you wouldn\u2019t want to believe that your child is in a better place. Quite often, they take it as a personal attack on their belief when it\u2019s really more about being honest about your own grief. It\u2019s funny how inconvenient my lack of faith as a bereaved mother can be for those on the outside. (Actually, it\u2019s not funny at all.)\n\nI sought out support groups in my area, but could not find any that were not held within a church. I did not feel comfortable going to one of these places for fear of verbally assaulting anyone who might suggest my daughter had earned her angel wings. It made me want to shake people until they realized that maybe she died simply because people die. Maybe she died because there were errors made in the care I received at the hospital I visited twice in the week before she died, where those who saw me shrugged off that I was spotting without reason. Maybe she died because I was unable to visit a new doctor because the office refused to see me without receiving the paperwork from my previous doctor in Miami, whose office continuously forgot to fax over my records, leaving me without regular medical care for weeks. Maybe she died because I had experienced tremendous stress after being fired from my job due to early pregnancy complications that required me to miss work, causing me to go on Medicaid in the first place, resulting in the aforementioned doctor shuffle. Maybe she died because of any other reason except that it was god\u2019s will. Maybe it was more about socio-economics and my own personal health than about imaginary lords in the sky.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Losing a newborn is always hard, but grieving as an atheist in a world of believers added loneliness to grief", "title": "My child is not in heaven: Your religion only makes my grief harder", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Losing a newborn is always hard, but grieving as an atheist in a world of believers added loneliness to grief", "title": "My child is not in heaven: Your religion only makes my grief harder", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/10/24/please_stop_telling_me_my_daughter_is_in_heaven/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/10/empty_crib.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Losing a newborn is always hard, but grieving as an atheist in a world of believers added loneliness to grief", "title": "My child is not in heaven: Your religion only makes my grief harder", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/10/empty_crib.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Priscilla Blossom", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, aol_on, Atheism, Editor's Pick, grieving, Life stories, premature baby", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf568\"", "article_summary": "When our daughter died, my husband requested to have our baby baptized, fearing in some way for her soul, a remnant of his Catholic upbringing.\nPeople don\u2019t understand how or why you wouldn\u2019t want to believe that your child is in a better place.\nHer short life, just eight hours long, has marked my life and my husband\u2019s life deeply.\nIt made me want to shake people until they realized that maybe she died simply because people die.\nMaybe she died because of any other reason except that it was god\u2019s will."}
