But the culture has \u2013 and not for the better.\n\n\u201cWhen I played from \u201969-\u201981, that was the era before ESPN and the media explosion, it was a better time,\u201d Dryer said. \u201cThere were gay players then. They were using the \u2018n-word\u2019 then, they\u2019re using it now. There\u2019re gay players now, nothing\u2019s changed except the politics.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat you get now is everybody sticking their nose into it. The league seems to be activists on many levels. They\u2019re going to police it. They\u2019re going to stick their nose into the game and flag people.\u201d\n\nAfter retiring from football, Dryer launched a successful acting career, most notably starring for seven seasons in the police drama \u201cHunter.\u201d He is now a radio talk-show host in Los Angeles.\n\nDryer, who said he tries to base his life on \u201ccommon sense, reason and \u2026 pursuing what is self-evident,\u201d told Levin the Democratic Party and Obamacare is aimed at getting Americans to abandon those principles.\n\n\u201cThey want to get rid of the middle class and make it completely dependent on government,\u201d he said.\n\nNine-year-old\u2019s awesome answer on math test reminds teacher to remember wounded warriors\n\nBut Dryer had little good to say about today\u2019s Republican leaders. He told the libertarian Levin the party is missing two things vital to success: leadership and a coherent message.\n\n\u201cThe Republican Party is dead from the neck up. They have no heart, really. They don\u2019t know what to do. They don\u2019t know what a narrative is. They don\u2019t know how to establish a narrative, or fight for one, or get out in front of a story and stay there,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to pinpoint \u2026 a handful of people that have any semblance of togetherness whatsoever.\u201d\n\nH/T: Tea Party News Network", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.4.3", "og": {"site_name": "BizPac Review", "description": "The dual disaster of political correctness in the NFL and political ineptness in the Republican Party establishment made for some rough handling Friday, when former Los Angeles Rams star-turned-actor Fred Dryer joined the Mark Levin radio show.
