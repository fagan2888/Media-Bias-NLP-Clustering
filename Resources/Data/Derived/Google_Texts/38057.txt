Snowy weather that led to multiple accidents prompted several mountain road closures Sunday.

Although snowfall has been moderate in the mountain regions, according to Chad Gimmestad with the National Weather Service in Boulder, with about 2 to 4 inches falling over the last 6 hours, it has been enough to make driving conditions dangerous.

“It’s not an extremely heavy snow, but enough to mess things up,” he said.

The heaviest report of snow, Gimmestad said, comes from Estes Park with 5 inches.

Snow fell starting Sunday night in the Denver area, and Gimmestad said another round is expected to fall in the morning.

He expects a couple more inches to fall Monday during the day, as well.

A fleet of 70 trucks will remain on duty overnight plowing and de-icing Denver’s main streets, according to a Denver Public Works news release.

Temperatures are expected to be in the 20s for the most of Monday.
