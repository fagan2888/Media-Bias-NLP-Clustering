Moving mental health care into the mainstream is very important to supporting the whole health of the person.\u201d\n\nOften, people seeking primary care will have untreated mental health issues, while people seeking mental health treatment will have undetected physical health issues, Azrin said.\n\nBoth the integration of mental health care into physical care settings, as well as the reverse, should continue, Azrin said.\n\n\u201cThe interventions need to respond to the patient\u2019s needs and they need to be compatible with actual practice patterns and the health-care system operations,\u201d Azrin said.\n\n\u2018One Overall Condition\u2019\n\nA range of physical conditions can be brought on by mental health medications, while a range of mental health conditions can be brought on by physical health medications and conditions, said Dr. Scott Grantham, who provides psychiatric consulting services for patients in the St. Francis Health System.\n\n\u201cThe two types of health categories that we often think about are often really part of one overall condition,\u201d Grantham said. \u201cThe brain illness affects the body, the body illness affects the brain.\u201d\n\nDr. Gerard Clancy, vice president of the College of Health Science at the University of Tulsa, said only recently has there been a move to better integrate mental and physical health care.\n\n\u201cThe need for integrated care has been talked about since the 1970s, but it really hasn\u2019t gotten rolling until now,\u201d Clancy said. \u201cSome of those pieces have not been recognized as improving health \u2013 substance abuse, mental illness, addiction, health literacy. Those things really haven\u2019t been recognized as much of a contributor to improving health. But today, those things are starting to change.\u201d\n\nThe Business Side\n\nRecent health care reforms such as the Affordable Care Act have \u201cshaken things up\u201d and caused more of an emphasis to be put on integrated care, Clancy said.\n\nHowever, employers, governments and insurers are still looking for ways to drive the cost of health care down, Clancy said, and integration of services and value-driven care reimbursement models (which are more focused on patient outcomes) are some of the ways being considered.\n\n\u201cIn the United States we spend more than any other country on health care and our health outcomes are in the bottom third of developed counties,\u201d Clancy said. \u201cThat should be a call to action for all of us.\u201d\n\nCompounding the issue, projections show the supply of doctors and nurses is falling short of growing demand, Clancy said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going to be able to graduate enough doctors to do this work,\u201d Clancy said. \u201cIt requires us all coming together, collaborating as a team, because no one discipline is going to be able to handle the load coming up.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"standout": "http://oklahomawatch.org/2015/09/18/at-tulsa-conference-a-call-to-wed-mental-and-physical-health-care/", "description": "At a Tulsa conference, experts talk about how the overall well-being of people hinges on accepting the inseparability of mental and physical health care.", "original-source": "http://oklahomawatch.org/2015/09/18/at-tulsa-conference-a-call-to-wed-mental-and-physical-health-care/", "og": {"site_name": "Oklahoma Watch", "description": "At a Tulsa conference, experts talk about how the overall well-being of people hinges on accepting the inseparability of mental and physical health care.", "title": "At Tulsa Conference, a Call to Wed Mental and Physical Health Care", "url": "http://oklahomawatch.org/2015/09/18/at-tulsa-conference-a-call-to-wed-mental-and-physical-health-care/", "image": "http://oklahomawatch.org/files/2015/09/Mental-Health-Conference-2015-1170x780.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@OklahomaWatch", "card": "summary"}, "syndication-source": "http://oklahomawatch.org/2015/09/18/at-tulsa-conference-a-call-to-wed-mental-and-physical-health-care/", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Mental Health"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce7d0\"", "article_summary": "Moving mental health care into the mainstream is very important to supporting the whole health of the person.\u201dOften, people seeking primary care will have untreated mental health issues, while people seeking mental health treatment will have undetected physical health issues, Azrin said.\nBoth the integration of mental health care into physical care settings, as well as the reverse, should continue, Azrin said.\n\u2018One Overall Condition\u2019A range of physical conditions can be brought on by mental health medications, while a range of mental health conditions can be brought on by physical health medications and conditions, said Dr. Scott Grantham, who provides psychiatric consulting services for patients in the St. Francis Health System.\nThis year\u2019s theme was \u201cMind, Body & Spirit,\u201d referring to the need for greater collaboration and integration between primary physical care and mental health care.\nTULSA \u2013 The overarching message at this year\u2019s Zarrow Mental Health Symposium was that to improve Oklahomans\u2019 physical and mental health outcomes, providers must take a more holistic and collaborative approach to care."}
