The governor's race is taking up most of the political oxygen in Florida, but the job of \"A.G.\" is the second most important statewide elected office.\n\nRather than directing their political energy toward explaining why he's the best candidate for the nomination, Sheldon and Thurston are instead competing to show who's more anti-Bondi and who can offer the strongest criticisms of Republican Gov. Rick Scott.\n\nSheldon and Thurston have a tough challenge. They're well known to political insiders, but not to the broad base of voters. And, neither has been able to raise much money. Bondi has raised more than six times the money of the two Democrats combined, and she still has most of her money while Sheldon and Thurston have spent most of what they've taken in.\n\nDemocratic primary voters also face a tough choice in deciding whom to back: There's about a millimeter of difference between Sheldon and Thurston on policy issues \u2014 and finding it requires an intense examination of their records and positions.\n\nThurston wants to repeal the controversial \"Stand Your Ground\" self-defense law, which became well known because of the George Zimmerman-Trayvon Martin case. Sheldon said it needs to be \"tweaked [and] I would consider repeal.\" The 2005 law says that a person has \"the right to stand his or her ground and meet force with force, including deadly force if he or she reasonably believes it is necessary to do so to prevent death or great bodily harm.\"", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "elections-politics, news", "og": {"site_name": "tribunedigital-sunsentinel", "description": "George Sheldon and Perry Thurston are so civil toward one another - publicly, at least - that they embraced after pitching themselves in back-to-back appearances before a group of...", "title": "Democratic candidates for attorney general differ on style, but agree on issues", "url": "http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/2014-08-08/news/fl-election-attorney-general-primary-20140808_1_perry-thurston-george-sheldon-attorney-general", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-53e4eb03/turbine/thurston-sheldon-combo-jpg-20140808/1200/1200x675", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100001837105818, "app_id": 143455335716926}, "description": "George Sheldon and Perry Thurston are so civil toward one another - publicly, at least - that they embraced after pitching themselves in back-to-back appearances before a group of"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdad88\"", "article_summary": "The two Democrats are competing in the Aug. 26 primary for their party's nomination to challenge Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi in November.\nThurston wants to repeal the controversial \"Stand Your Ground\" self-defense law, which became well known because of the George Zimmerman-Trayvon Martin case.\nSheldon and Thurston have a tough challenge.\nGeorge Sheldon and Perry Thurston are so civil toward one another \u2014 publicly, at least \u2014 that they embraced after pitching themselves in back-to-back appearances before a group of Democratic activists in Plantation.\nDemocratic primary voters also face a tough choice in deciding whom to back: There's about a millimeter of difference between Sheldon and Thurston on policy issues \u2014 and finding it requires an intense examination of their records and positions."}
