Trump even mocked Clinton\u2019s use of a TelePrompTer, a clear reference to Obama\u2019s reliance on the same device. \u201cI watched Hillary,\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019s got the biggest TelePrompTer I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d Trump, who is leading national polls for the GOP nomination, also chuckled when a supporter shouted \u201cObama sucks!\u201d Trump then muttered, \u201cThat\u2019s beautiful.\u201d\n\nBill Clinton on Republicans: \u2018Kind of scary\u2019: Hillary Clinton\u2019s husband, Bill, also spoke in New England on Monday, and dubbed the Republican presidential field \u201ckind of scary.\u201d Former President Clinton didn\u2019t mention anyone by name when speaking in New Hampshire, CNN reports. Clinton avoided talking about Trump, but Trump has recently revived the Monica Lewinsky scandal as a way to attack the former president and his wife.\n\nSanders to warn Wall Street: The Wall Street Journal writes Bernie Sanders, who is challenging Hillary Clinton for the Democratic nomination, will seek to cast himself as Wall Street\u2019s toughest cop on Tuesday. The Vermont senator will give a policy speech in New York City and is expected to lay out more details of his plan to crack down on the investment industry. He will reiterate his calls to break up banks that are too big to fail, and to reinstate the Glass-Steagall Act, which separated commercial and investment banking. Hillary Clinton opposes reinstating the act.\n\nLatest Obamacare repeal vote: The House will vote Wednesday to undo President Obama\u2019s health-care law, the Hill writes. But unlike the other 60-plus Obamacare repeal votes since 2011, the vote will send the legislation to Obama\u2019s desk. The president has said he would veto the measure. Republicans expect to hold votes attempting to override the veto, but they lack the numbers in both the House and Senate to overturn Obama\u2019s expected action.\n\nPresidential candidates pressed: Conservative activists, writes the New York Times, know they won\u2019t see a repeal of Obamacare signed into law with President Obama in the White House. But the group Heritage Action for America wants the current GOP field of presidential candidates to commit to repealing the law if elected to the White House. Among other things, the group said the next Republican administration should agree to use all executive authority at its disposal to halt regulation of the insurance market under the health law.\n\nMore from MarketWatch", "article_metadata": {"parsely-author": "Robert Schroeder", "twitter": {"domain": "marketwatch.com", "description": "Donald Trump says Hillary Clinton would be \u2018four more years of Obama\u2019; Bill Clinton calls the Republican presidential field \u2018kind of scary\u2019; Bernie Sanders to warn Wall Street; and more.", "creator": "@mktwrobs", "image": {"width": 1320, "identifier": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-DY214_donald_ZG_20151101142920.jpg", "height": 742}, "site": {"id": 624413}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.content_group": "marketwatch", "article.section": "Economy & Politics", "parsely-type": "post", "lifp_basePath": "https://id.marketwatch.com/access", "parsely-link": "http://www.marketwatch.com/story/donald-trump-says-hillary-clinton-would-be-four-more-years-of-obama-2016-01-05", "author": "Robert Schroeder", "parsely-title": "Donald Trump says Hillary Clinton would be \u2018four more years of Obama\u2019", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=336693422", "parsely-pub-date": "2016-01-05T07:26:00-05:00", "description": "Donald Trump says Hillary Clinton would be \u2018four more years of Obama\u2019; Bill Clinton calls the Republican presidential field \u2018kind of scary\u2019; Bernie Sanders to warn Wall Street; and more.", "page.site": "marketwatch", "robots": "noarchive,noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 283204329838}, "parsely-section": "MW_Economy & Politics", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/marketwatch"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "og": {"site_name": "MarketWatch", "description": "Donald Trump says Hillary Clinton would be \u2018four more years of Obama\u2019; Bill Clinton calls the Republican presidential field \u2018kind of scary\u2019; Bernie Sanders to warn Wall Street; and more.", "title": "Donald Trump says Hillary Clinton would be \u2018four more years of Obama\u2019", "url": "http://www.marketwatch.com/story/donald-trump-says-hillary-clinton-would-be-four-more-years-of-obama-2016-01-05", "image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-DY214_donald_ZG_20151101142920.jpg", "type": "article"}, "ob": {"image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-DY214_donald_ZG_20151101142920.jpg"}, "article.id": "13384120-B3A4-11E5-BB11-07687B07ADD9", "position": 1}, "article_summary": "Donald Trump was looking past the Republican presidential primary on Monday night and right to the general election, taking aim at Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton.\nHillary Clinton opposes reinstating the act.\nClinton avoided talking about Trump, but Trump has recently revived the Monica Lewinsky scandal as a way to attack the former president and his wife.\nLatest Obamacare repeal vote: The House will vote Wednesday to undo President Obama\u2019s health-care law, the Hill writes.\nSanders to warn Wall Street: The Wall Street Journal writes Bernie Sanders, who is challenging Hillary Clinton for the Democratic nomination, will seek to cast himself as Wall Street\u2019s toughest cop on Tuesday."}
