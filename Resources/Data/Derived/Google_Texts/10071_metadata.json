Good luck with that, Shanny. Schefter also tweets that Redskins owner Daniel Snyder won\u2019t fire Shanahan for cause since the coach\u2019s contract is \u201cironclad.\u201d\n\nOn the other side, you have Jason La Canfora of CBS Sports quoting Redskins Park sources eviscerating the current coaching staff, mainly offensive coordinator and Mike Shanahan offspring Kyle Shanahan. It\u2019s the equivalent of verbal grenades lobbed from behind cover. Among the very, very anonymous contentions:\n\n1. A current member of the Redskins organization says Kyle complains about everything, including the food in the cafeteria, the field and the equipment. (In his defense, have you seen that field?) The same anonymous source says Kyle isn\u2019t well-liked, probably like the majority of offensive coordinators of 3-10 teams.\n\n2. Kyle treats Robert Griffin III \u201clike a [junior varsity] quarterback\u201d and reveled too much in last season\u2019s win over the Dallas Cowboys, as did every single person in America who doesn\u2019t root for the Dallas Cowboys.\n\n3. He also has \u201centitlement syndrome\u201d but \u201cit\u2019s his father\u2019s fault for pacifying his son.\u201d\n\nThe biggest surprise is that the sources didn\u2019t blame Kyle for the Obamacare website debacle.\n\nAll the chaos in Washington promises to grow exponentially in the coming weeks, as the world turns. These are the days of ours, and Dan Snyder\u2019s, lives.", "article_metadata": {"description": "If it's Sunday morning, it must be time for dueling, anonymous tales of discord from Redskins Park.
