Shiller of Yale and Eugene F. Fama of the University of Chicago, might be seen as having conflicting views about the workings of financial markets. At first blush, Mr. Shiller\u2019s thinking about the role of \u201cirrational exuberance\u201d in stock markets and housing markets appears to contradict Mr. Fama\u2019s work showing that such markets efficiently incorporate news into prices.\n\nWhat kind of science, people wondered, bestows its most distinguished honor on scholars with opposing ideas? \u201cThey should make these politically balanced awards in physics, chemistry and medicine, too,\u201d the Duke sociologist Kieran Healy wrote sardonically on Twitter.\n\nBut the headline-grabbing differences between the findings of these Nobel laureates are less significant than the profound agreement in their scientific approach to economic questions, which is characterized by formulating and testing precise hypotheses. I\u2019m troubled by the sense among skeptics that disagreements about the answers to certain questions suggest that economics is a confused discipline, a fake science whose findings cannot be a useful basis for making policy decisions.\n\nThat view is unfair and uninformed. It makes demands on economics that are not made of other empirical disciplines, like medicine, and it ignores an emerging body of work, building on the scientific approach of last week\u2019s winners, that is transforming economics into a field firmly grounded in fact.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIt is true that the answers to many \u201cbig picture\u201d macroeconomic questions \u2014 like the causes of recessions or the determinants of growth \u2014 remain elusive. But in this respect, the challenges faced by economists are no different from those encountered in medicine and public health. Health researchers have worked for more than a century to understand the \u201cbig picture\u201d questions of how diet and lifestyle affect health and aging, yet they still do not have a full scientific understanding of these connections. Some studies tell us to consume more coffee, wine and chocolate; others recommend the opposite. But few people would argue that medicine should not be approached as a science or that doctors should not make decisions based on the best available evidence.\n\nAs is the case with epidemiologists, the fundamental challenge faced by economists \u2014 and a root cause of many disagreements in the field \u2014 is our limited ability to run experiments. If we could randomize policy decisions and then observe what happens to the economy and people\u2019s lives, we would be able to get a precise understanding of how the economy works and how to improve policy. But the practical and ethical costs of such experiments preclude this sort of approach. (Surely we don\u2019t want to create more financial crises just to understand how they work.)", "article_metadata": {"tone": "opinion", "ptime": 20131020193143, "twitter": {"description": "Don\u2019t let the skeptical response to this year\u2019s Nobel Prize fool you.", "title": "Yes, Economics Is a Science", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/21/opinion/yes-economics-is-a-science.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000002507593"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_150_black.png", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/21/opinion/yes-economics-is-a-science.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000002507593", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/21/opinion/yes-economics-is-a-science.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "opinion", "hdl_p": "Yes, Economics Is a Science", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "Oct. 20, 2013", "edt": "NewYork", "keywords": "Economics (Theory and Philosophy),Nobel Prizes,Shiller  Robert J,Fama  Eugene F", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "Raj Chetty", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "per": "Fama, Eugene F", "byl": "By RAJ CHETTY", "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "Don\u2019t let the skeptical response to this year\u2019s Nobel Prize fool you.", "tom": "Op-Ed", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "description": "Don\u2019t let the skeptical response to this year\u2019s Nobel Prize fool you.", "CG": "opinion", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "Oct. 20, 2013", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "Op-Ed", "article": {"section_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/pages/opinion/index.html", "section": "Opinion", "modified": "2014-08-04", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "tag": "Fama, Eugene F", "published": "2013-10-20", "section-taxonomy-id": "AD8090D7-4137-4D71-84C8-70DA3BD89778"}, "slug": "21chetty", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20140804234502, "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/21/opinion/yes-economics-is-a-science.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_291_black.png", "type": "article", "description": "Don\u2019t let the skeptical response to this year\u2019s Nobel Prize fool you.", "title": "Yes, Economics Is a Science"}, "pdate": 20131020, "des": "Nobel Prizes", "articleid": 100000002507593, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "Yes, Economics Is a Science", "col": "Op-Ed Contributor", "PST": "Op-Ed"}, "article_summary": "What kind of science, people wondered, bestows its most distinguished honor on scholars with opposing ideas?\nI\u2019m troubled by the sense among skeptics that disagreements about the answers to certain questions suggest that economics is a confused discipline, a fake science whose findings cannot be a useful basis for making policy decisions.\nBut few people would argue that medicine should not be approached as a science or that doctors should not make decisions based on the best available evidence.\nBut in this respect, the challenges faced by economists are no different from those encountered in medicine and public health.\n\u2014 THERE\u2019S an old lament about my profession: if you ask three economists a question, you\u2019ll get three different answers."}
