Obama signed his health care overhaul into law four years and seven months ago on March 23, 2010.\n\nObamacare\u2019s deep unpopularity continues to weigh on vulnerable Democrats in tight midterm elections, as candidates are left to defend many of the president\u2019s Obamacare promises that turned out to be untrue.\n\nPresident Obama promised at least 19 times that Obamacare would lower the health insurance premiums by $2,500 per family. Politifact labeled Obama\u2019s statement a \u201cPromise Broken.\u201d\n\nPresident Obama promised at least 36 times that \u201cif you like your health care plan, you can keep your health care plan,\u201d a statement that was crowned Politifact\u2019s \u201cLie of the Year.\u201d\n\nPresident Obama promised, \u201cIf you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor,\u201d only to later concede that Americans \u201cmight end up having to switch doctors.\u201d\n\nStill, despite the broken promises and the policy\u2019s deep unpopularity, Obama continued to boast that Obamacare enrolled \u201ceight million\u201d people \u2014 a figure that the Obama administration later admitted was inflated by at least 700,000 people. Moreover, given that Obamacare canceled the plans of five million Americans, many of those the administration counts as \u201cenrollees\u201d are merely the millions of individuals who lost their plans due to Obamacare and were then forced by the threat of penalty to re-enroll through Obamacare.\n\nNow, nearly five years after its passage, Obamacare will soon face judgment by midterm election voters. Indeed, as Obama himself has stated, \u201cMake no mistake: these policies are on the ballot. Every single one of them.\u201d\n\nVoters\u2019 disdain for Obamacare will soon be registered. Voters head to the polls in three days.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Obamacare as Unpopular as Ever", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Obamacare as Unpopular as Ever", "title": "Obamacare as Unpopular as Ever - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Big-Government/2013/Obamacare/obamacare_DMV_protester_AP.jpg", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2014/11/02/obamacare-as-unpopular-as-ever/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Obamacare as Unpopular as Ever", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Big-Government/2013/Obamacare/obamacare_DMV_protester_AP.jpg", "title": "Obamacare as Unpopular as Ever - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "app_id": 1243316582352556, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": ",Big Government,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Big Government", "published_time": "2014-11-02T14:35:00-07:00", "categories": "Big Government"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdad14\"", "article_summary": "President Obama promised at least 19 times that Obamacare would lower the health insurance premiums by $2,500 per family.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERDespite Obamacare being the law of the land for 1,685 days, President Barack Obama\u2019s signature legislative achievement remains as unpopular as ever.\nMoreover, given that Obamacare canceled the plans of five million Americans, many of those the administration counts as \u201cenrollees\u201d are merely the millions of individuals who lost their plans due to Obamacare and were then forced by the threat of penalty to re-enroll through Obamacare.\nAccording to the RealClearPolitics average of polls, just 38 percent of Americans now support Obamacare.\nObama signed his health care overhaul into law four years and seven months ago on March 23, 2010."}
