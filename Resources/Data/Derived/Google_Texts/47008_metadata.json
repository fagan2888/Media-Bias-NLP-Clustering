As a small business owner, you\u2019ve already got a lot on your plate--and keeping up with labor laws can be a game of catch-up. But don\u2019t worry, we\u2019ve got you covered. Here are two of the newest small business labor laws you need to know for 2015.\n\nEmployers with 50 or More Employees May Have to Pay\n\nIf you\u2019re a small business employer with 50 or more employees, you may now be subject to the Employer Shared Responsibility penalty if you do not offer affordable coverage, as a part of the Affordable Care Act. So, what is the Employer Share Responsibility (ESR)? It\u2019s the requirement for larger employers to either offer health insurance to employees, or pay a fee if/when an employee buys subsidized health insurance through the Marketplace.\n\nHow is the Fee Calculated?\n\n2015 is the first year that employers are subject to the Employer Shared Responsibility fee. The fee is equal to the number of full-time employees the employer employed for the month (minus 80) multiplied by 1/12 of $2,000, provided that at least one full-time employee receives a premium tax credit/subsidy for that month.\n\nIf you are a larger employer and are wondering how to calculate your ESR fee, see our related article \u201cQuick Guide to Calculating Employer Shared Responsibility Fees in 2015\u201d\n\nNew Minimum Wages for 21 States\n\nIn January of 2014, Barack Obama called on Congress to raise the federal minimum wage. And though the federal minimum wage has been $7.25 since 2009, some U.S. states are giving workers higher wages on their own.\n\nAs such, 21 different states raised their minimum wage anywhere to nearly $8/hour and some have increased to over $10/hour. Listed below is a basic guide to minimum wage increases for the 21 states:\n\nAlaska - $8.75/hour\n\nArizona - $8.05/hour\n\nArkansas - $7.50/hour\n\nColorado - $8.23/hour\n\nConnecticut - $9.15/hour\n\nFlorida - $8.05/hour\n\nHawaii - $7.75/hour\n\nMaryland - $8/hour\n\nMassachusetts - $9/hour\n\nMissouri - $7.65/hour\n\nMontana - $8.05/hour\n\nNebraska - $8/hour\n\nNew Jersey - $8.38/hour\n\nNew York - $8.75/hour\n\nOhio - $8.10/hour\n\nOregon - $9.25/hour\n\nRhode Island - $9/hour\n\nSouth Dakota - $8.50/hour\n\nVermont - $8.73/hour\n\nWashington - $9.47/hour\n\nWest Virginia - $8/hour\n\nWashington D.C. - $10.50/hour\n\nFor a more detailed breakdown of wages by state, see our related article \u201cMinimum Wage Rates for 2015, By State\u201d\n\nConclusion\n\nIt\u2019s obvious that your small business is impacted by labor laws, so make it a point to keep up with what\u2019s going on with both state and federal laws.
