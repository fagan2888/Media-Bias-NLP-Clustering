A Denver woman faces a criminal charge after her 11-month-old child was found underwater in a bathtub.

Alexis Duron-Deluna, 25, has been charged with child abuse with serious bodily injury in the Monday incident, according to the Denver district attorney’s office.

The infant, who was not breathing after being removed from the water, was taken to a local hospital.

The baby had been in Duron-Deluna’s care at the time of the incident, prosecutors said in a news release.

Duron-Deluna remains in custody on a $50,000 bond.

Her next court appearance is set for Monday.
