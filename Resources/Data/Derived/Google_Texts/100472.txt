Fat Tuesday may still be a month away, but that did not stop the celebration in Panama City Beach. The Saint Andrews Mardi Gras kick off was Saturday night at the Edgewater Beach Resort.

Saint Andrews Mardi Gras began in 1997 when Bay County's very first Mardi Gras Krewe approached the St. Andrews community to relocate the annual parade to the historic St. Andrews.

Now the Krewe of St. Andrews donates more than $50,000 to community organizations like Sims Veterans Home, Florida State Panama City, and the Boys and Girls club. Newschannel 7's Donna Bell emceed the event.

"It's one of the special events that we have throughout the year. We are so happy to have all our members here tonight to celebrate this special event we will have tonight," said Edward Strickland, King of the 2015 St. Andrews Mardi Gras.

"Every King and Queen has a charity and there's been various groups that have benefited and our krewe has given over $100,000 back to the community," explained Darlene Tate, Queen of the 2015 St. Andrews Mardi Gras.

The 18th Annual Krewe of St. Andrews Mardi Gras Parade will be Saturday, February 7th.
