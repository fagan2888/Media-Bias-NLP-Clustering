The celebrity magazine broke the news on its Instagram account Tuesday morning (Aug. 5), using Paisley and Underwood bobblehead dolls.\n\n41-year-old Paisley and 31-year-old Underwood have displayed a unique comedic chemistry since debuting as co-hosts in 2008. Over the years they have sung funny songs, danced, and gently made light of everything from the Nashville Flood to the Obamacare website.\n\nPaisley is currently appearing on TV\u2019s \u2018Rising Star\u2018 singing competition. His new album, \u2018Moonshine in the Trunk,\u2019 is set for release on Aug. 26. He is also crossing the country on his Country Nation World Tour.\n\nUnderwood is also hard at work on a new album, which she hints is a bit of a departure.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just a progression, a different sound without losing myself in it,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m not taking some crazy musical departure from what I\u2019ve done, but it definitely feels different. It will feel different, look different, sound different.\u201d\n\nThe 2014 CMA Awards will air live from Nashville\u2019s Brodgestone Arena on Nov. 5 at 8PM ET on ABC.\n\nNEXT: The Top 10 Carrie Underwood Songs", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.thumb": "http://theboot.com/files/2013/08/Brad-Paisley-Carrie-Underwood.jpg", "sailthru.author": "sterlingwit", "description": "Brad Paisley and Carrie Underwood are returning to host the CMA Awards together for the seventh consecutive year.", "og": {"site_name": "The Boot", "description": "Brad Paisley and Carrie Underwood are returning to host the CMA Awards together for the seventh consecutive year.", "title": "Brad Paisley, Carrie Underwood Returning to Host CMA Awards", "url": "http://theboot.com/brad-paisley-carrie-underwood-host-2014-cma-awards/", "image": "http://theboot.com/files/2013/08/Brad-Paisley-Carrie-Underwood.jpg?w=600&h=0&zc=1&s=0&a=t&q=89", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"site": "@thebootdotcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-08-05 11:20:41", "sailthru.title": "Brad Paisley, Carrie Underwood Returning to Host 2014 CMA Awards", "keywords": "2014 cma awards hosts", "fb": {"admins": 59877105906, "app_id": 151086041747752}, "sailthru.tags": "tsmsite-theboot, tsmmarket-national, tsmtype-national, brad-paisley, carrie-underwood, cma-awards, cmas, country-news", "sailthru.description": "Brad Paisley and Carrie Underwood are returning to host the CMA Awards together for the seventh consecutive year.", "sailthru.image.full": "http://theboot.com/files/2013/08/Brad-Paisley-Carrie-Underwood.jpg", "viewport": "width=1020"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd636\"", "article_summary": "Jason Kempin, Getty ImagesBrad Paisley and Carrie Underwood are returning to host the CMA Awards together for the seventh consecutive year.\nIt will feel different, look different, sound different.\u201dThe 2014 CMA Awards will air live from Nashville\u2019s Brodgestone Arena on Nov. 5 at 8PM ET on ABC.\nNEXT: The Top 10 Carrie Underwood Songs\nThe celebrity magazine broke the news on its Instagram account Tuesday morning (Aug. 5), using Paisley and Underwood bobblehead dolls.\n\u201cIt\u2019s just a progression, a different sound without losing myself in it,\u201d she says."}
