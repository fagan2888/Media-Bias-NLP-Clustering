But Carson is calling those critics out, claiming they are merely spouting \u201cpropaganda.\u201d\n\nIn a related report by the Inquisitr, Ben Carson\u2019s violent history as a youth came out during a recent interview with Meet The Press. He admits to trying to assault people, and even committed a stabbing. Carson says those days are well behind him, but the source for this amazing change in the teenage Carson goes back to his beliefs as a Seventh Day Adventist. But some critics claim he is not \u201cauthentic\u201d in his religious beliefs due to his opposition to gun control laws.\n\nCarson also believes his critics are purposefully misinterpreting him on other key points. For example, Politico reported that the retired neurosurgeon wanted to \u201cabolish\u201d Medicare and Medicaid even though the Republican Party platform, which says the party \u201cis committed to saving Medicare and Medicaid.\u201d\n\nIn the past, Carson addressed concerns that he wanted to get rid of government welfare programs.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not interested in getting rid of the safety net,\u201d he said, according to Politifact. \u201cI\u2019m interested in getting rid of dependency, and I want us to find a way to allow people to excel in our society, and as more and more people hear that message, they will recognize who is truly on their side and who is trying to keep them suppressed and cultivate their votes.\u201d\n\nIn the end, Politifact ruled that critics left out \u201cimportant details and [took] things out of context,\u201d noting that Carson \u201cintends to maintain programs public safety nets for people who need them.\u201d\n\nCarson has also claimed critics are saying \u201cyou can\u2019t give poor people a health savings account because they\u2019re too stupid,\u201d but the Republican candidate believes differently. Carson does say he wants Obamacare repealed, and instead wants to implement a different type of self-moderated health planning system.\n\n\u201cI have suggested that we provide the ability for anyone to have a health savings account from the day they are born until the day they die,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll pay for it with the same dollars that we pay for traditional health care with. When people are able to see how much more freedom they will have, and how much more flexibility they will have, and how much more choice they would have, I think it\u2019s going to be a no-brainer.\u201d\n\nFast forward to the recent Meet The Press interview, and Carson found himself interrupting Chuck Todd after it was suggested that Carson wanted to \u201cget rid of Medicare\u201d in favor of a plan where the \u201cgovernment would give you $2,000 a year.\u201d\n\n\u201cFirst of all, what I have said is that the system that I would put in place would largely negate the need for Medicare or for Medicaid. So I\u2019m not talking about getting rid of those programs. And the way that I generally see things, entitlement programs, et cetera, is we create a mechanism that allows people to ascend the ladder of success to the extent that they don\u2019t need those programs anymore. That\u2019s what I\u2019m talking about. Now, people will always try to reinterpret that to say, \u2018Carson wants to get rid of this. He wants to get rid of that. And he wants to leave all these people in a terrible situation.\u2019 That\u2019s propaganda.\u201d\n\nIn describing his health care plan, Carson says he wants a flexible health savings account which allows family members to shift money around in order to help each other. Carson believes this approach will give \u201cenormous flexibility without a middleman,\u201d although he admits \u201cit doesn\u2019t take care of catastrophic health care.\u201d But he says people would purchase catastrophic health insurance, and \u201cit\u2019s going to cost you a lot less now because the vast majority of things are coming out of your HSA.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo the only thing coming out of your catastrophic insurance is real catastrophic health care,\u201d he explained. \u201cIt\u2019s sort of like having a homeowner\u2019s policy with a big deductible versus a homeowner\u2019s policy where you want every scratch covered. Two completely different animals.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, the GOP candidate also says the \u201cmoney from Medicaid\u201d is going to be reallocated by the government in order to \u201cto take care of those health savings accounts.\u201d\n\nWhat do you think about Ben Carson\u2019s Medicaid plans?\n\n[Photo by Kevork Djansezian/Getty Images]", "article_metadata": {"description": "Ben Carson's medicaid plans have some critics claiming that the 2016 GOP candidate wants to get rid of the popular welfare programs.
