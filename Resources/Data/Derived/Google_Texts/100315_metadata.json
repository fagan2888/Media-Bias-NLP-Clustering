After years of negotiations, he\u2019s finally agreed to take on his No. 1 critic live, in person, TV cameras and all \u2013 Wall Street Journal columnist and Heritage Foundation\u2019s chief economist Steve Moore, Thursday, July 9, 2015, at FreedomFest.\n\n\u201cI believe it\u2019s going to be the most explosive debate in modern economic history and I want you to have a ringside seat with me when it happens,\u201d says organizer Mark Skousen. \u201cIn fact, I\u2019ll be the moderator to make sure we hold these two top economists to the fire.\u201d\n\nThe two will square off on the most important economic topics:\n\nAusterity vs. stimulus\n\nBig government vs limited government\n\nEasy money (the paper dollar) vs, sound money (gold)\n\nProgressive vs. flat tax\n\nInequality vs. growth\n\nObamacare vs. market health care\n\nSteve Moore and Skousen will hold a special debriefing the next morning to talk about the impact of this historic debate to the country, your business and your portfolio.\n\n\u201cFreedomFest is my favorite conference of the year, and I make sure to attend all three days,\u201d says Forbes. \u201cIt\u2019s non-stop action. It\u2019s where the best ideas and strategies are fleshed out. You will be amazed at the people you meet. Can anything good come out of Vegas? You bet. Come and see for yourself.\u201d\n\nWhat kind of conference engenders so much enthusiasm and return attendance? FreedomFest is unique. As Robert Poole, Jr., co-founder of Reason magazine, puts it, \u201cFreedomFest is the most intense, rewarding, intellectual, create-your-own three-day conference I have ever attended.\u201d\n\nOne attendee dubbed it the Disneyland of the mind, an intellectual feast in the entertainment capital of the world. There are dozens of sessions, panels and debates \u2013 on topics ranging from philosophy, history, science & technology, money and investing, healthy living, geo-politics, law and religion.\n\n\u201cBarnum and Bailey said they were the greatest show on Earth,\u201d said Harry Backmender of Connecticut. \u201cThey were wrong. FreedomFest is the greatest show on Earth! I can\u2019t wait to be there.\u201d\n\nThe full program has not yet been announced, but in addition to Beck, Forbes, Stossel and Farah, Whole Foods CEO John Mackey, billionaires Peter Thiel and Steve Wynn (the man responsible for the new Las Vegas) are lined up.\n\nIt\u2019s Beck\u2019s first appearance. The former CNN and Fox News star Glenn Beck, former Fox News anchorman and one of Time magazine\u2019s \u201cTop 100 Most Influential People in the World\u201d will speak on the topic, \u201cWe Will Not Conform!\u201d based on his new book, \u201cConform: Exposing the Truth about Common Core and Public Education.\u201d\n\nHe will be joined by Sen. Mike Lee, who will speak on his new book, \u201cThe Long Constitution,\u201d and Rep. Justin Amash, considered the next \u201cRon Paul\u201d among libertarian Republicans.\n\nEvery year FreedomFest has theme. This year it\u2019s \u201cDiscovering the New American Dream.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a Dream Team of speakers I can\u2019t wait to hear myself including philosophers, historians, scientists, economists, business leaders, financial gurus, artists, and healthy living experts,\u201d says the ever-enthusiastic Skousen.\n\nThey include:\n\nDinesh D\u2019Souza, author, filmmaker, and debater extraordinaire (he\u2019s never lost a debate at FreedomFest in eight years) will be released from the \u201ccommunity confinement center,\u201d where he has been assigned for violating federal election rules just in time to speak on \u201cWhat It\u2019s Like to be a Political Prisoner in America.\u201d\n\nCharles Murray, senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, on why he now advocates civil disobedience to fix government in his new book \u201cBy the People: Rebuilding Liberty Without Permission.\u201d\n\nGrover Norquist, president of Americans for Tax Reform and named the No. 1 most powerful broker in Washington by CNN, on \u201cFlat Tax, Fair Tax, No Tax: The Future of Tax Reform Around the World.\u201d\n\nJoseph Farah, founder and Chief Executive Officer of WND.com will speak on the topic \u201cThe Free Press Unbound: America\u2019s 200 Year Love Affair with Muckraking.\u201d\n\nRich Little, the world\u2019s No. 1 impressionist, will perform \u2013 lampooning politicians including the past six presidents, all of whom he has known personally.\n\nFreedomFest attendees are eligible for a big break from Planet Hollywood if they act fast, with rooms for $109 a night.\n\nYou can register online or call toll-free at 1-855-850-FREE.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Free Press For A Free People Since 1997", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.1", "og": {"site_name": "WND", "description": "LAS VEGAS \u2013 The Washington Post calls it \u201cthe greatest libertarian show on Earth.\u201d Who could argue?
