As a modern-day take on \u201cPride and Prejudice,\u201d Sittenfield\u2019s book keeps close to its inspiration\u2019s main points of conflict; issues of class, vanity, and love run rampant within its pages. But to weigh the thematic value of \u201cEligible\u201d against that of the classic novel would be to do Sittenfeld\u2019s work a disservice. \u201cEligible\u201d does not promise to be another \u201cPride and Prejudice.\u201d While its plot might be similar (albeit with much-needed contemporary twists) and its characters might possess the same names, it does not try to evoke poetic phrases or present mind-shattering commentary on the world. Instead, Sittenfeld has successfully crafted a fun, engaging romp whose greatest mission is to excite any Jane Austen fan.\n\n\u201cEligible\u201d is both familiar and not: Liz Bennet, a 30-something magazine writer, and her older sister, Jane, have not had the best of luck in love. Liz is currently in an affair-but-not with her crush of over a decade. Jane, approaching 40, is still without a husband or child, having turned to a sperm bank to fix the latter problem. When their father has a heart attack, the two sisters return from New York City to Cincinnati to care for him and find their stately home and not-so-stately family in incredible chaos. But Liz\u2019s attempts to take control of the situation spiral out of control when the family meets Chip Bingley, a doctor and past contestant on the reality TV show \u201cEligible\u201d (the book\u2019s version of \u201cThe Bachelor\u201d), and his brooding neurosurgeon friend, Fitzwilliam Darcy.\n\nThe updated plot allows Sittenfeld to surprise the reader by playing off well-known elements within the story of the original and adding new twists. Jane\u2019s use of artificial insemination changes the nature of the initial fallout between Bingley and Jane, while Bingley\u2019s past participation in \u201cEligible\u201d becomes a crucial part of their eventual reunion. Wickham\u2014the soldier who captures Elizabeth\u2019s fancy and elopes with Lydia in Austen\u2019s original story\u2014becomes two different characters with surprising backstories, incredibly different from the handling of the character in \u201cPride and Prejudice\u201d but well-updated for the new setting and time period. Such changes let Sittenfeld to honor the original while keeping the reader hooked and chortling at any unexpected development. Furthermore, Sittenfeld shows incredible awareness of her source material and uses the reader\u2019s familiarity with the story to her advantage\u2014often to comic effect. In \u201cPride and Prejudice,\u201d Darcy insults Elizabeth\u2019s family and then declares his love for her, saying \u201cYou must allow me to tell you how ardently I admire and love you.\u201d But in \u201cEligible,\u201d when Darcy shows up at Liz\u2019s door to confess his affection for her early in the morning (\u201cI was in my pajamas and didn\u2019t even have a bra on,\u201d Liz tells Jane in a comment that further highlights the awkwardness of the situation), his proclamation is just as memorably haughty, though now he insinuates that his love for her is \u201cprobably an illusion caused by the release of oxytocin during sex.\u201d This interplay between science and romance, situated in a version of a classic novel, not only emphasizes the modernity of Sittenfeld\u2019s tale but also adds a touch of newfound humor to the situation.\n\nBesides revamping the story, the novel reinterprets the classic characters of \u201cPride and Prejudice\u201d while simultaneously granting them a sleeker, more modern dimension. In particular, Sittenfeld endows the entire Bennet family with a certain vivacity; Mr. Bennet, for instance, is still his unforgettable wry self, but now his humor is more casual and packs a harsher punch. \u201cA reality show isn\u2019t unlike the Nobel Peace Prize, then\u2026. in that they both require nominations,\u201d he notes early on in the novel. The care with which Sittenfeld portrays the Bennet family, perhaps even greater than the care with which she portrays Liz\u2019s romantic interest in Darcy, suggests her greater fascination with family dynamics than with romance\u2014\n\nand while the novel contains enough sexually intense interactions between Darcy and Liz to satisfy any Austen diehard, the duo\u2019s interactions fill a relatively small portion of the novel\u2019s 500 pages. Sittenfeld still considers marriage, but a family\u2019s change becomes much more important. This decision is a successful one: Not only does it differentiate the story from its predecessor, but it also feels more suitable for the world in which the characters now exist. As a modern woman, Liz will not let a suitable marriage define the rest of her life\u2014she already has a stable income from her work\u2014so it is reasonable that her daily worries consist more of tending to her family and balancing her work.\n\nTo emphasize the new setting further, contemporary issues receive some attention. Mrs. Bennet is racist and anti-Semitic, and both she and her husband are unaware of what it means to be transgender. The Affordable Care Act receives several mentions throughout the story, especially when the characters discover that the Bennet parents do not have health insurance. Yet while the novel touches upon these weighty political issues, it does not philosophize; in fact, the mentions are brief sentences and phrases in a much longer dialogue or narration. Sittenfeld is not interested in making a social argument\u2014rather, she alludes to these topics to show how the characters are now operating within more modern contexts.\n\nThe melding of gravity and flair with a rejection of all intellectual pretense also appears in Sittenfeld\u2019s writing style. Sittenfeld does not string together poignant phrases into paragraphs, instead employing a breezy language that makes the novel quick and easy to absorb. Yet she often engages in witty wordplay: \u201c[Love is] a condition that\u2019s acute, not chronic,\u201d Mr. Bennet says. The effect is an awareness of the thematic and stylistic value of the original novel, but one that does not strive to clone this appeal, instead opting for more comedic means.\n\nUltimately, \u201cEligible\u201d is a light-hearted and hilarious read for lovers of Austen\u2019s works or for those in search of a clever romantic comedy. The novel is not the most revolutionary book on the market, but then again, enlightenment does not seem to be Sittenfeld\u2019s goal. Instead, she seeks to pay homage to a famous work of literature by giving it a fresh and entertaining makeover. There exist many truths in this world, but for Sittenfeld in her latest book, the greatest truth is the universality\u2014one transcending centuries and countries\u2014to be found in Austen\u2019s beloved tale.\n\n\u2014Staff writer Ha D.H.
