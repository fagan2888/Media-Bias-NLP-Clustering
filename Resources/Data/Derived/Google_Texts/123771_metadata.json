The only stupid question is the one you\u2019re afraid to ask. So I just sent the following email to the Communications Office at the University of Virginia:\n\nDear Sir or Madam:\n\nIn following up on the Rolling Stone story, I came across a column at National Review by K.C. Johnson in which he points to Emily Renda\u2019s July 2014 Senate testimony, saying that Ms. Renda \u201cappears never to have filed a complaint with the university, much less with the police.\u201d\n\nMs. Renda said nothing about these details of her own case in her Senate testimony, and I have been unable to ascertain whether in fact there was any police or university investigation of this alleged crime of, if so, whether anyone was prosecuted or disciplined as a result.\n\nCan you provide information about this case? Ms. Renda\u2019s status as a rape survivor has been the basis of her own activism in this regard, which in turn made her a key connection for Sabrina Rubin Erdely\u2019s reporting in Rolling Stone. Therefore, I seek your assistance in answering the point made by K.C. Johnson.\n\nSincerely,\n\nRobert Stacy McCain\n\nThe American Spectator", "article_metadata": {"fb": {"pages": 1742097289343962}, "generator": "WordPress 4.4", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3fe2\"", "article_summary": "The only stupid question is the one you\u2019re afraid to ask.\nMs. Renda\u2019s status as a rape survivor has been the basis of her own activism in this regard, which in turn made her a key connection for Sabrina Rubin Erdely\u2019s reporting in Rolling Stone.\nAs a journalist, there is a danger in taking things for granted.\nTherefore, I seek your assistance in answering the point made by K.C.\nSo I just sent the following email to the Communications Office at the University of Virginia:Dear Sir or Madam:In following up on the Rolling Stone story, I came across a column at National Review by K.C."}
