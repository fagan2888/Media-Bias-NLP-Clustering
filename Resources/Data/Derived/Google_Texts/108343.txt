A jury has convicted a 31-year-old man in the 2014 death of another man.

The Lawrence Journal World reports that Dustin Walker was found guilty Friday of first-degree felony murder in the March 2014 death of 39-year-old Patrick Roberts. It was Walker's third trial in connection with Roberts' death after two previous juries failed to reach decisions on the murder charge.

Walker was accused of breaking into Roberts' duplex to steal marijuana and money. During the incident, police say, Walker shot and killed Roberts.

Another defendant, Archie Robinson, was found guilty earlier of first-degree murder and aggravated burglary in Roberts' death. He was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole for 20 years.

Sentencing for Walker is April 29.
