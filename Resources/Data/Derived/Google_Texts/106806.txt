Gainesville’s chief financial officer, Melody Marlowe, has been named interim city manager while officials seek a permanent replacement for Kip Padgett.

Padgett announced earlier this month that he has accepted a job as the town manager in Wake Forest, N.C. His last day as Gainesville’s city manager is July 2.

Marlowe, who has worked for the city since 1996, will take the reins the following day. She attended North Georgia College, where she earned a bachelor’s degree of business administration in accounting.

Mayor Danny Dunagan told The Times that Marlowe has the experience and knowledge to assume the interim role.

“She’s been here a while, so she knows all the ins and outs,” he added. “It’s no reflection on anyone else ...”

City officials said they will advertise the city manager’s opening beginning July 1 and will accept applications for the job until July 31. The top five candidates will get interviews.
