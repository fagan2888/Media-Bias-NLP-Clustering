However, new evidence from Massachusetts General Hospital suggests estrogen \u2013 more commonly associated with female menopause \u2013 mediates some symptoms of \u201candropause\u201d in men.\n\nThe idea of male menopause has solidified itself into medical culture in recent years, which has been matched by a tremendous boost in doctor\u2019s prescriptions for testosterone supplements. A 500 percent increase in prescriptions was recorded between 1993 and 2000, and this pattern continued over the course of the following decade.\n\nThis supplement boom occurred, despite the fact that it is not completely understood why testosterone deficiency causes physical symptoms \u2013 like muscle loss, weight gain, lowered sex drive, and fatigue \u2013 in middle-aged men.\n\nHormonal Process Of Elimination\n\nNew findings, reported today in the New England Journal of Medicine, try to resolve this matter by exploring how sex hormones, outside of testosterone, impact male menopause. In particular, they look at estrogen, whose age-related decline causes similar physical changes in women during menopause.\n\nTestosterone and estrogen live on opposite sides of a single enzymatic coin.\n\nEstrogen is a derivative of testosterone that is synthesized by the enzyme aromatase. Women make more estrogen than men because their primary sex organ \u2013 the ovaries \u2013 is packed with aromatase; however, men carry steady levels of the enzyme in their skin, brains, and fat tissue.\n\nTo assess estrogen\u2019s potential role in male menopause, researchers at Mass General recruited 400 healthy men aged 20 to 50 and had them take a drug that artificially deprived them of testosterone.\n\nThe subjects were then divided into groups that received a testosterone supplements at a range of doses -- 1.25-, 2.5-, 5-, 10- grams per day \u2013 or they took a placebo. Concurrently, a subset of these testosterose-dosed men were then asked to take a drug that suppressed aromatase and subsequently their ability to make estrogen.\n\nThis setup allowed the researchers to compare estrogen loss with and without testosterone deficiency. The treatments were administered for 16 weeks.\n\nThe most adverse effects of estrogen deficiency were on sexual desire \u2013 with men in this group reporting dramatic declines in arousal and erectile function. Losing estrogen did not impact lean mass, muscle size or leg strength anymore than testosterone deprivation. Estrogen also appeared to control fat production.\n\n\"This study establishes testosterone levels at which various physiological functions start to become impaired, which may help provide a rationale for determining which men should be treated with testosterone supplements,\" said lead author Dr. Joel Finkelstein of the Mass General Endocrine Unit.\n\nAlthough this experiment depended on the artificial manipulation of sex hormones, it does provide clues into the functions of both estrogen and testosterone in middle-aged men. Overall, the results suggest that testosterone governs muscle size and strength, while estrogen mediates weight gain. Both hormones seemed crucial to sex drive.\n\n\u201cThe biggest surprise was that some of the symptoms routinely attributed to testosterone deficiency are actually partially or almost exclusively caused by the decline in estrogens that is an inseparable result of lower testosterone levels,\" continued Dr. Finkelstein. \"We also need to look into how testosterone replacement therapy would effect prostate health \u2013 both prostate cancer and the prostate enlargement that causes unpleasant symptoms in many older men \u2013 and heart disease.\"\n\nSource: Finkelstein JS, Lee H, Burnett-Bowie SM, et al.
