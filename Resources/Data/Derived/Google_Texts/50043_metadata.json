Rob Bradley (R-Fleming Island) remained optimistic about prison reform. Bradley had a huge role in helping craft aspects of the bill.\n\n\u201cWell, prison reform is something that I\u2019ve been very passionate about, and it looks like we\u2019re almost there. So, I feel confident that we\u2019ll have meaningful prison reform this session. But, we have a week left, and we need to certainly cross all the t\u2019s and dot all the i\u2019s on that issue,\u201d said Bradley, at the time.\n\nBut, after the House adjourned three days earlier than the scheduled date Friday amid a budget impasse with the Senate, Senate President Andy Gardiner announced the death of the proposal.\n\n\u201cI look at the list of bills that when you go into the last three days of session\u2014when you have a House and Senate as partners working together\u2014that will not make it because of the actions of the House: the Corrections bill that Senator [Greg] Evers brought forward to this chamber and this body with an oversight commission. The last three days of session, you should be negotiating that as a partner. That bill\u2019s not going to make it,\u201d said Gardiner, following the House's departure Tuesday.\n\nBoth the House and Senate proposals had some similarities and some differences, but both bills began to align after the House passed the omnibus bill. One major difference was the Senate\u2019s version originally had a nine-member oversight board that could conducts its own investigations and do surprise inspections into correctional facilities. But, the House stripped that out of the bill, in favor of the creation of a Joint Legislative Committee\u2014with members appointed by the House Speaker and the Senate President. But, that language was actually never incorporated into the latest version of the House bill.\n\nAnd, the Senate President was not pleased.\n\n\u201cAnd, so we sent a very good work product with an independent commission to oversee our Department of Corrections,\u201d said Gardiner. \u201cThey changed it. They dumped it on our doorstep, and we\u2019re going to dump it back on theirs.\u201d\n\nNeither was Sen. Greg Evers (R-Baker), who led the Senate\u2019s prison reform effort.\n\n\u201cI feel the bill that the Senate actually came up with was an outstanding bill and was right for the people of Florida\u2014at the point, that they made the move to take out that language out of the bill\u2026at that point, I felt like they had not negotiated in good faith and left their intention all along of doing nothing,\u201d stated Evers, speaking to reporters Tuesday.\n\nAnd, on the floor, when the bill came up for a final vote in the Senate Wednesday, Evers made similar remarks.\n\n\u201cA lot of the things that they added can be done right now,\u201d said Evers. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t reform. The Secretary can do the majority of the things that they tried to add under the pretense that we were making changes, and we were saving lives.\u201d\n\nThe House proposal included the expansion of the Department of Corrections regional offices and their roles, making it easier to fire investigators within the department, and the creation of a pilot program.\n\nEvers says they left out a lot of areas that would have made an impact, like tracking use of force incidences, more training for prison guards\u2014not to mention the oversight commission.\n\n\u201cI was really disappointed,\u201d said George Mallinckrodt, a former DOC mental health counselor. \u201cYou know, I worked pretty hard on trying to get something passed.\u201d\n\nMallinckrodt says he was pretty encouraged with the work product so far that the Senate had proposed.\n\n\u201cWell, they had a lot of felony consequences for abusing inmates, for medical neglect, the oversight commission was the most important thing, they were looking at putting cameras in, blind spots\u2014positive developments really in, I guess you could say, the prison reform movement,\u201d he added.\n\nSo, he says he still doesn\u2019t understand why the two chambers couldn\u2019t come to an agreement on this important issue.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t get it,\u201d continued Mallinckrodt. \u201cThey\u2019re all Republicans. Come one, and get together and make this happen. It seemed liked the two Houses were bickering, and meanwhile, inmates continue to be abused. Some of these abusive guards\u2014their attitude I\u2019m sure is business as usual. I mean they can breathe a huge sigh of relief that this bill is not passed.\u201d\n\nBut, some don\u2019t believe in the so-called \u201cdemise of prison reform.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, I knew that a lot of people in newspapers around the state are saying that this was the \u2018demise of prison reform,\u2019 but I don\u2019t really see it that way. I mean that\u2019s reporters seeing the glass half empty. I see the glass half full,\u201d said Barney Bishop, the President and CEO of Florida Smart Justice Alliance.\n\nBishop says he was opposed to the oversight commission from the beginning.\n\n\u201cSo, we were happy to see that go down,\u201d added Bishop. \u201cWhy? You shouldn\u2019t give nine people that\u2019s supposedly would have no connection with the Department of Corrections the power to subpoena people, the power to meet at the prisons\u2014both of which are going to create security issues.\u201d\n\nWhat he says he is in favor of is the Joint Legislative Commission, which he credits his group for giving the House that idea. Bishop adds what should be done is for lawmakers to allow the new Secretary Julie Jones to have ample time to get settled into the job and continue the reforms of her predecessor.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, because of circumstances that were outside of her control, the legislature jumped in with a bunch of things,\u201d continued Bishop. \u201cBut, I think this Secretary knows that everybody is watching what she does and how the department performs, and how it responds to the things that have been going on at the department, and I think that this will give her an opportunity to start turning the ship some more after the last Secretary, Secretary Michael Crews, had begun turning the ship, to begin with.\u201d\n\nStill, for now, all prison reform supporters and advocates agree that something should be done about Florida\u2019s troubled prison system and lawmakers should continue to look into prison reform efforts.\n\nFor more news updates, follow Sascha Cordner on Twitter: @SaschaCordner.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"category": "HNF Stories", "description": "Prison reform may be officially dead this session, but prison reform advocates remain hopeful there will be some meaningful reform for Florida\u2019s troubled", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://health.wusf.usf.edu/post/prison-reform-bill-may-be-dead-advocates-remain-hopeful-reform-will-occur", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/shared/npr/styles/medium/nprshared/201505/403644633.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Prison reform may be officially dead this session, but prison reform advocates remain hopeful there will be some meaningful reform for Florida\u2019s troubled", "title": "Prison Reform Bill May Be Dead, But Advocates Remain Hopeful Reform Will Occur"}, "story_id": 403644135, "twitter": {"site": "@HealthNewsFL", "card": "summary", "creator": "@HealthNewsFL"}, "author": "Sascha Cordner", "org_id": 390, "dc": {"title": "Prison Reform Bill May Be Dead, But Advocates Remain Hopeful Reform Will Occur"}, "nid": 10507, "datePublished": "2015-05-03", "keywords": "prison reform, Florida Department of Corrections, Florida Legislature 2015", "wordCount": 1238, "has_audio": 1, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdbecc\"", "article_summary": "Prison reform may be officially dead this session, but prison reform advocates remain hopeful there will be some meaningful reform for Florida\u2019s troubled prison system.\n\u201cWell, prison reform is something that I\u2019ve been very passionate about, and it looks like we\u2019re almost there.\nSo, I feel confident that we\u2019ll have meaningful prison reform this session.\nRob Bradley (R-Fleming Island) remained optimistic about prison reform.\nBut, that language was actually never incorporated into the latest version of the House bill."}
