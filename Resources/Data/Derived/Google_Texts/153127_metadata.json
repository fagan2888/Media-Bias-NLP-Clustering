Police hemmed the demonstrators into a small corner of the square and then fired several jets of water to force them down a side street. The Dogan News Agency says rubber pellets were also used.\n\nWithin minutes, the noisy but otherwise peaceful rally restarted a few blocks away and grew to several thousand people as the day wore on. An Associated Press reporter at the scene occasionally smelled tear gas, but there didn\u2019t appear any further attempt by police to interfere with the protest.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Turkish police use water cannons to clear gay pride rally", "title": "Turkish police use water cannons to clear gay pride rally", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Turkish police use water cannons to clear gay pride rally", "title": "Turkish police use water cannons to clear gay pride rally", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/06/28/turkish_police_use_water_cannons_to_clear_gay_pride_rally/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/06/aptopix-turkey-gay-pride-parade.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Turkish police use water cannons to clear gay pride rally", "title": "Turkish police use water cannons to clear gay pride rally", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/06/aptopix-turkey-gay-pride-parade.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Topics: From the Wires, NewsISTANBUL (AP) \u2014 Turkish police used water cannons and tear gas against gay pride marchers trying to rally in Istanbul\u2019s central square on Sunday, forcing the thousands of demonstrators to gather several blocks away.\nAn Associated Press reporter at the scene occasionally smelled tear gas, but there didn\u2019t appear any further attempt by police to interfere with the protest.\nWithin minutes, the noisy but otherwise peaceful rally restarted a few blocks away and grew to several thousand people as the day wore on.\nBetween 100 and 200 protesters were chased away from Taksim Square as they began gathering in the late afternoon.\nPolice hemmed the demonstrators into a small corner of the square and then fired several jets of water to force them down a side street."}
