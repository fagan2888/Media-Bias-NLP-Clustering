And then there are 30-odd who just kind of did their best. And so I guess my point is: Just being the president is not a good way of thinking about it. . . . You want to be a great president.\u201d\n\nTonight, President Obama gives his final State of the Union address, one that promises to omit any \u201clong list of proposals,\u201d according to The New York Times, in favor of a \u201cthematic message.\u201d I always liked the president best as an interviewee rather than orator. In one-on-one interactions or extemporaneous moments, Obama has often cast himself in self-effacing terms\u2014\u201cWe\u2019re part of a long-running story; we just try to get our paragraph right,\u201d etc.\u2014even when he is, perhaps, suggesting that he might want to become one of the greatest presidents in history.\n\nBut Obama\u2019s public speaking, for which he is celebrated, might actually reveal even more of his true personality\u2014one that has always been hard to fully get. Through his speeches, over the years, we have been able to glimpse the true scale of his ambition. And on this measure, even by presidential standards, Obama stands out.\n\nMost presidential speeches, of course, err on the side of grandiosity. Bill Clinton vowed, \u201cAmerica will lead the world toward shared peace and prosperity and the far frontiers of science and technology.\u201d George W. Bush intoned that we would \u201ctake the next steps of space exploration: human missions to Mars and to worlds beyond.\u201d (Yeah, that would have been well managed.) But, as Obama once said, \u201cI actually believe my own rhetoric.\u201d\n\nOver the years, that rhetoric called for a whole lot. In February 2009, Obama vowed to tackle health care, education, energy, the financial industry, the auto industry, Guantanamo Bay, peace in the Middle East, and possibly tartar buildup (I\u2019d have to check). That September, when health-care reform looked fragile, the president took to the stage before a joint session of Congress to tell us to \u201cmeet history\u2019s test.\u201d He also\u2014for neither the first time nor the last\u2014told everyone to stop playing games and \u201creplace acrimony with civility, and gridlock with progress.\u201d You may recall the era of good feeling that ensued.\n\nObama\u2019s repeated vow to bring lawmakers together may have been one of his costliest follies. If a man persuades his ex-wife to sit down and rework some details on their divorce settlement, it\u2019s best if he doesn\u2019t turn to the cameras and say, \u201cSee, I told you I could get us both sitting down to talk.\u201d Since Obama had sold himself as a unifier during his initial campaign, every legislative deal, if completed, promised him a double win: here\u2019s a deal the president achieved, which also showed what a great unifier he could be. That meant a double loss for the opposition, of course, and politicians tend to disfavor that sort of thing.\n\nBut the folly had an unexpected benefit too: it allowed Republicans to win the narrative, so to speak, while Obama won the war. Even as the G.O.P. could get everyone to agree that Obama had failed to change the culture in Washington, the White House was steadily, obstinately muscling through massive changes: health-care packages, stimulus plans, Wall Street reform, major trade deals, executive orders for amnesty, a nuclear deal with Iran, diplomatic relations with Cuba, the climate deal in Paris, the New START treaty, repealing \u201cDon\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell,\u201d removing banks from student-loan programs, two liberal Supreme Court appointments (leading to same-sex marriage rights), and so on.
