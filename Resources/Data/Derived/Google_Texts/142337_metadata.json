This information was (confirmed) by another student and the teacher.\u201d\n\nThe mother said she was also upset about the district\u2019s refusal to cover medical expenses for the hospital visit, in which her daughter received stitches and an antibiotic to treat the bite and scratches.\n\n\u201cThey should be responsible for it because it was in their school and my child was in their care,\u201d Hernandez said. \u201cWhat disturbs me is that the school did not contact animal control, I had to do it.\u201d\n\nAccording to the district\u2019s statement, the prairie dog received a physical from a veterinarian before being placed in the classroom.\n\nThe school district is also not legally obligated to assist with medical expenses except for when a motor vehicle is involved because of the Texas Torts Claims Act and the Texas Constitution, which prohibits school districts from extending credit, Cowley wrote.\n\n\u201cWhile this is an unfortunate incident, there is not a legal way for CCISD to pay for the bills,\u201d he wrote.\n\nPort Lavaca, a city of about 12,400, is located about 330 miles south of Dallas near Victoria.", "article_metadata": {"liveFyreID": "aHR0cDovL3RoZXNjb29wYmxvZy5kYWxsYXNuZXdzLmNvbS8yMDE2LzAyL3BvcnQtbGF2YWNhLXN0dWRlbnQtYml0dGVuLWJ5LWNsYXNzcm9vbS1wcmFpcmllLWRvZy5odG1sLw==", "generator": "WordPress 3.9.12", "author": "Claire Z.
