Phillip Cardenas, the company\u2019s head of safety, said telling drivers about this program acts as a deterrent.\n\nThe wealth of information Uber has about the driver and rider helps with safety, company officials said, especially GPS tracking during rides.\n\n\u201cThe reality of it is, if you have bad intent, an Uber trip is the worst place to commit a crime,\u201d Macdonald said. \u201cTo put it crassly, you\u2019re going to get caught.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "In a story Feb. 13 about ride-hailing company Uber releasing a panic button on its app for Chicago, The Associated Press, based on information from the Chicago Sun-Times, misspelled the last name of Uber's Midwest regional manager.
