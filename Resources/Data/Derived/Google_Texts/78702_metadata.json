Gone are the days of meeting dates through a mutual friend. Today we have speed dating, Match.com, and of course, the newest of the futuristic dating expenditures: pheromone parties. This is pretty much what you might gather: an event where singletons are invited to find love based on how much they like each other's scent.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like sweat and a tiny bit of perfume, or just, like clean,\u201d explained 23-year-old Steven Lucas while attending the latest pheromone party in London. Pheromone parties have been around since 2010, with the first taking place in Brooklyn N.Y., but now can be found throughout the world. The most recent location in the English capital surprisingly had more than 140 guests, with plenty more on the waiting list, the NY Daily News reported.\n\nWith its hip Camden market, home of all things underground and shocking, London is not new to new-age trends, which is good because pheromone parties are certainly new-age. Before the event, attendees are asked to wear a t-shirt for three days without deodorant or perfumes. This results in ab end-product of completely unadulterated natural scent, hopefully chock-full of pheromones. The shirts are then placed into numbered bags and strangers are invited to take a sniff and see what they think.\n\nThe concept is based on the widely known but not exactly scientifically accepted ideas of human pheromones. In the animal world, airborne molecules called pheromones elicit a sexual reaction in members of the opposite sex, Smithsonian reported. Researchers have yet to find a human version of the sex scent, but \u201cthat doesn\u2019t mean a human pheromone doesn\u2019t exist. It just means we haven\u2019t found one yet,\u201d George Preti of the Monell Chemical Senses Center in Philadelphia told Smithsonian. Creator Judith Prays thought this idea of human chemical attraction would be a great way to sniff out a potential mate, and thus the pheromone party was born.\n\nAccording to the parties\u2019 website, the get-together \u201cis primarily successful in that it opens up interesting, intimate conversations, and breaks down barriers to make strangers comfortable chatting.\u201d Whether or not you can truly sniff your way to true love doesn\u2019t seem to be of all that much importance at these parties. Couples simply enjoy the alternative dating method for meeting other young singles. \"It is such a weird concept. It's a huge ice-breaker because you are smelling a stranger's T-shirt \u2014 you can't be cool or pretentious,\u201d said organizer of the most recent London event, Judy Nadel.\n\nNot all participants were as open to sniff the three-day worn shirts of strangers. \u201cFunnily enough, I was scared that someone would smell my shirt and throw it down,\" Bob, 48, told the Daily News. Anticipating the hesitation partygoers might experience, Nadel went on to order an aroma therapeutic masseuse to help singles relax a bit. \"I've got a mixture of geranium rose with black pepper, so I'm using that to give massages to aid a bit of relaxation,\" said masseuse Laurie Nouchka.
