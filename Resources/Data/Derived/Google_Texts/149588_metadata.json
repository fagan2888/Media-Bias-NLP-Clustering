A few passed a pint of Jack Daniels around as the chimes rang in the lobby, beckoning spectators to their seats.\n\nStanding next to a window overlooking City Hall, seventh-graders Greg Kalman and Luke McMahan played an Xbox video game.\n\n\u201cGet \u2019em, get \u2019em, get \u2019em,\u201d Greg said to the screen. \u201cOh, sack!\u201d\n\nThe symphony set up the NFL Madden game in the lobby for its tribute to \u201cSuper Bowl 50: Concert of Champions.\u201d Greg couldn\u2019t believe it when his mom told him the symphony was going to play a night of football music, set to clips from football films.\n\n\u201cI was flabbergasted, I guess. I was like, are you joking?\u201d he said.\n\nThen he thought it through.\n\n\u201cThere is a certain rhythm to sports. Like how in tennis you have this very loud pop of sound when the ball hits the racket. And in football you have the whistles, the tackles, the yelling,\u201d he said. \u201cSo then I realized this could be either a train wreck or it could be really good, but I have a feeling it\u2019s going to be really nice and really coordinated, like a beautiful play.\u201d\n\nThe symphony set up a giant movie screen looming over the orchestra for the show, rolling football highlight reels from the 1960s to today. The original soundtrack was removed, so the symphony could play it live. Reinforcements for the brass and percussion sections were called in (there were 8 French horns on stage) to produce the emotional swells and dramatic climaxes of NFL music.\n\nIn one film clip, set to composer Sam Spence\u2019s \u201cSabers and Six Guns,\u201d the quarterback throws a long pass. The violins get louder as the ball flies, in slow motion, toward the end zone. One player tries to catch it, but misses. The cymbals crash. Then another guy reaches up \u2014 the orchestra swells \u2014 and completes the pass. The trumpets hit their peak and the audience cheers. Touchdown.\n\n\u2018This music has spit and blood and sweat and guts and laughing\u2026At its base, it\u2019s supposed to be fun, and not stiff or awkward.\u2019 Composer Tom Hedden\n\n\u201cFootball is just power. Times 10,\u201d says Tom Hedden, a composer who wrote music for NFL films and TV specials for 19 years. \u201cThese are the biggest and the fastest and the strongest human beings there are. So the music needs to carry that kind of power with it.\u201d\n\nHe recalls one rehearsal from his career, when the studio orchestra wasn\u2019t producing the volume or energy he wanted. He told the musicians a story of when he was walking through the office hallways and bumped into Christian Okoye, a running back for the Kansas City Chiefs at the time. He was dressed in full pads for a film shoot.\n\n\u201cMy nose met him at his solar plexus. He totally dwarfs me,\u201d Hedden says. \u201cI basically was giving the point to the musicians that there is no such thing as too loud or too high or too strong because we\u2019re talking about the extremes of human performance.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nHedden loves that some of his work is now being performed on stage by a world-renowned symphony. But he hopes people will also keep it in perspective.\n\n\u201cThis music has spit and blood and sweat and guts and laughing. It\u2019s about a game,\u201d he says. \u201cAt its base, it\u2019s supposed to be fun, and not stiff or awkward.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s exactly the idea, says Richard Lonsdorf, the symphony\u2019s associate director of artistic planning. At the \u201cConcert of Champions,\u201d people cheered readily when their favorite players graced the screen, and booed at rivals. Waves of laughter floated over the audience during the section of football follies, set to music by Spence, Hedden and David Robidoux, as players accidentally ran into cheerleaders, dove into tables of Gatorade, and straddled the goal post.\n\nFor the sake of the future, Lonsdorf says, the symphony want to move beyond the \u201csit down and shut up\u201d model of classical music, without abandoning its core mission.\n\n\u201cThis is the age-old question of classical music \u2014 it\u2019s been going out of style for centuries. There\u2019s this sense that the audiences are growing older. They\u2019re dying off. They aren\u2019t being replaced by new ones.\u201d\n\nSo, a couple of years ago, the symphony started a film series. They show movies like \u201cPsycho\u201d and \u201cStar Trek,\u201d while the orchestra plays the musical score live. Later this month, they\u2019ll show \u201cVertigo,\u201d and after that, \u201cE.T.\u201d Lonsdorf says the series has attracted a younger, more diverse audience.\n\n\u201cYou create this ability for people to feel more comfortable with things, and we hope that it will start to bleed over into our standard offerings,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s a real leap to imagine that someone coming for the first time to the symphony\u2019s \u2018Concert of Champions\u2019 is suddenly going to sign up for our next Mahler cycle. Not that they shouldn\u2019t. But you have to create interstitial steps between this kind of project and our most venerable classical properties. And so that\u2019s something we\u2019re constantly working on and refining.\u201d\n\nFor Luke McMahan and Greg Kalman, football night was a success.\n\n\u201cI loved how the music correlated completely with the plays. When the guy was ramming through people and running for the touchdown,\u201d Luke said.\n\n\u201cI got more of a respect for the sport,\u201d Greg added. \u201cThese players really do work hard. It\u2019s really great to witness.\u201d\n\nThough the symphony hopes new audiences will leave the football program with a greater appreciation for music, Luke and Greg walked out with a greater appreciation for football.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The San Francisco Symphony hopes new audiences will leave the football program with a greater appreciation for music.", "contextly-page": "{\"title\":\"Symphony Plays Music From NFL Films, Set to Football Highlight Reels\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/news\\/2016\\/02\\/07\\/symphony-plays-music-from-nfl-films-set-to-football-highlight-reels\",\"pub_date\":\"2016-02-07 01:00:14\",\"mod_date\":\"2016-02-05 18:55:24\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":10855532,\"author_id\":\"3205\",\"author_name\":\"April Dembosky\",\"author_display_name\":\"April Dembosky\",\"tags\":[\"Football\",\"San Francisco Symphony\"],\"categories\":[\"Arts and Culture\",\"News\",\"Sports\"],\"image\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/news\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/sites\\/10\\/2016\\/02\\/FootballSymph-1.jpg\"}", "og": {"site_name": "KQED News", "description": "The San Francisco Symphony hopes new audiences will leave the football program with a greater appreciation for music.", "title": "Symphony Plays Music From NFL Films, Set to Football Highlight Reels", "url": "http://ww2.kqed.org/news/2016/02/07/symphony-plays-music-from-nfl-films-set-to-football-highlight-reels/", "image": "http://ww2.kqed.org/news/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2016/02/FootballSymphony2-800x643.jpg", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@kqednews", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@"}, "fb": {"app_id": 160023622793}, "keywords": "football,san francisco symphony", "google-site-verification": "Oam-TnlJjUP-cg8UEyR3-KcLp8_-WTy6_dBaSws1ADA", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "\u201cOh, sack!\u201dThe symphony set up the NFL Madden game in the lobby for its tribute to \u201cSuper Bowl 50: Concert of Champions.\u201d Greg couldn\u2019t believe it when his mom told him the symphony was going to play a night of football music, set to clips from football films.\nIt\u2019s really great to witness.\u201dThough the symphony hopes new audiences will leave the football program with a greater appreciation for music, Luke and Greg walked out with a greater appreciation for football.\nAnd so that\u2019s something we\u2019re constantly working on and refining.\u201dFor Luke McMahan and Greg Kalman, football night was a success.\nTimes 10,\u201d says Tom Hedden, a composer who wrote music for NFL films and TV specials for 19 years.\nStanding next to a window overlooking City Hall, seventh-graders Greg Kalman and Luke McMahan played an Xbox video game."}
