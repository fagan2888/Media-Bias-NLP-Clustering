There’s no doubt, being a parent is challenging. Some of those challenges have always existed, some are new to the 21st century. We worry about the health of our children. And if we’re lucky enough to have healthy children, we worry about their successes in life. Today, the pressure on parents and children to succeed has escalated dramatically.

SAT scores, extracurricular activities, volunteering, summer courses to get ahead, tutoring, test prep -- it can be grueling for the entire family. And at what cost?

Today we focus on three very different parenting styles with author and psychiatrist Dr. Shimi Kang. She discusses the benefits and meaning of a balanced life.
