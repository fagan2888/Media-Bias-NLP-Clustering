The 9th Circuit overturned a lower court that had said the rules were unconstitutional.\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court last year allowed closely held corporations to seek exemptions from the Obamacare health law\u2019s contraception requirement.\n\nIn Washington, the state permits a religiously objecting individual pharmacist to deny medicine, as long as another pharmacist working at the location provides timely delivery. The rules require a pharmacy to deliver all medicine, even if the owner objects.\n\nA unanimous three-judge 9th Circuit panel on Thursday decided that the rules are constitutional because they rationally further the state\u2019s interest in patient safety. Speed is particularly important considering the time-sensitive nature of emergency contraception, the court said.\n\n\u201cThe time taken to travel to another pharmacy, especially in rural areas where pharmacies are sparse, may reduce the efficacy of those drugs,\u201d wrote Judge Susan Graber.\n\nAttorney General Bob Ferguson, in a statement, called the decision a \u201cmajor victory for the people of Washington.\u201d\n\n\u201cDecisions regarding medical care \u2013 including reproductive rights \u2013 are appropriately between a patient and his or her medical professionals,\u201d Ferguson said.\n\nKristen Waggoner, senior vice president of Legal Services for the group Alliance Defending Freedom, said the pharmacists would appeal the ruling.\n\n\u201cNo one should be forced to choose between their religious convictions and their family businesses and livelihoods, particularly when the state allows referrals for just about any other reason,\u201d Waggoner said in a statement.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Beliefs", "generator": "Easy Digital Downloads v2.5.16", "og": {"site_name": "Religion News Service", "description": "The court said the", "title": "Pharmacists can\u2019t claim religion to deny emergency contraception, appeals court rules", "url": "http://religionnews.com/2015/07/24/pharmacists-cant-claim-religion-to-refuse-to-sell-emergency-contraception-appeals-court-rules/", "image": "http://religionnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/RNS_Logo_Clr_Med-336x264.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@RNS", "card": "summary"}, "syndication-source": "http://religionnews.com/2015/07/24/pharmacists-cant-claim-religion-to-refuse-to-sell-emergency-contraception-appeals-court-rules/", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://religionnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-RNS_logo_RGB-336x336.gif", "original-source": "http://religionnews.com/2015/07/24/pharmacists-cant-claim-religion-to-refuse-to-sell-emergency-contraception-appeals-court-rules/", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "description": "The court said the"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd93f6\"", "article_summary": "Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco, came in a case filed by pharmacists who objected to delivering emergency contraceptives.\nThe 9th Circuit overturned a lower court that had said the rules were unconstitutional.\nA unanimous three-judge 9th Circuit panel on Thursday decided that the rules are constitutional because they rationally further the state\u2019s interest in patient safety.\nThe U.S. Supreme Court last year allowed closely held corporations to seek exemptions from the Obamacare health law\u2019s contraception requirement.\nKristen Waggoner, senior vice president of Legal Services for the group Alliance Defending Freedom, said the pharmacists would appeal the ruling."}
