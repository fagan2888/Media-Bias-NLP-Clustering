(Pioneer Press: Ben Garvin)\n\nIt was billed as an economic policy address, but President Barack Obama used a friendly venue Friday in Minneapolis to unload on congressional Republicans, accusing them of doing the bidding of the rich and powerful at the expense of the middle class.\n\n\u201cSometimes I\u2019m supposed to be politic about how I say things, but I\u2019m finding lately I just want to say what\u2019s on my mind,\u201d Obama told a ticketed crowd of 3,500 at the Lake Harriet Band Shell.\n\nWhen he arrived Thursday in the Twin Cities, the president said he felt \u201csuper loose.\u201d He continued to let it all hang out during his final speech to an enthusiastic lakeside audience before flying back to Washington at noon.\n\n\u201cSo far this year, Republicans in Congress have blocked or voted down every single idea for strengthening the middle class,\u201d he said.\n\nThey have said \u201cno,\u201d he asserted, to raising the minimum wage, guaranteeing equal pay for women and extending unemployment insurance to more than 3 million Americans whose benefits have expired.\n\n\u201cRather than invest in working families getting ahead, they actually voted to give another massive tax cut to the wealthiest Americans,\u201d he said, accusing them of keeping in place \u201cthings (that) help those at the top and don\u2019t help you.\u201d\n\nRepublicans hit back, saying Obama\u2019s policies are making it even harder to create jobs.\n\n\u201cInstead of coming to Minnesota to listen and consider a different approach on the struggling economy, it\u2019s clear President Obama\u2019s visit is all about doubling down on his failed partisan agenda and pumping up Democrats ahead of a tough midterm election,\u201d Republican National Committee spokesman Michael Short said in a statement.\n\n\u201cWith recent news that the economy contracted worse than originally thought and America\u2019s middle class is no longer the world\u2019s richest, it\u2019s clear President Obama\u2019s policies still aren\u2019t working and the country needs a new direction.\u201d\n\nWith Gov. Mark Dayton and other top Democratic-Farmer-Labor candidates in the audience, the event appeared more political rally than policy forum.\n\nThe president repeatedly said during his 30-minute speech that he was fighting for the struggling middle class, the same theme Dayton and other DFL candidates have sounded all year.\n\nHe praised Minnesota for being one of 13 states to increase the minimum wage this year, a move Dayton and DFL lawmakers are touting as a signature accomplishment.\n\nHe defended his Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, saying more than 8 million Americans got health insurance through the program, including 180,000 Minnesotans.\n\n\u201cSo here in Minnesota, you can now say the women are strong, the men are good-looking, the children are above average, and 95 percent of you are insured,\u201d he joked.\n\nAmericans can\u2019t wait for an obstinate Congress to act, he continued: \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m moving ahead without them.\u201d\n\nHe chided House Republicans for planning a lawsuit accusing him of abusing his executive power. \u201cThey\u2019re not doing anything, and then they\u2019re mad at us for doing something,\u201d he said.\n\nMinnesota Republicans have criticized the minimum wage increase as threats to business growth and the state\u2019s MNsure version of Obamacare as broken and wasteful.\n\nMichael Steel, a spokesman for U.S. House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, said it is Obama and Democrats who are blocking House-passed bills to create jobs.\n\n\u201cThe president keeps doubling down on policies that have failed to increase prosperity,\u201d Steel said.\n\nNonetheless, Obama asserted he still wants to work with congressional Republicans on boosting the minimum wage, making sure women get fair pay and reforming immigration.\n\n\u201cI want to work with them, but they\u2019ve got to give me something. They\u2019ve got to try to deliver something, anything,\u201d he said.\n\nObama concluded by saying, \u201cI\u2019m here to tell you, don\u2019t get cynical. \u2026 America is making progress,\u201d he said. \u201cHope is a better choice.\u201d\n\nObama\u2019s speech won favorable reviews from people who showed up to hear him.\n\nHonora Rodriguez of St. Paul said it\u2019s tough for her young family to get by on her salary as a librarian at the South St. Paul library. Her husband, Daniel Rodriguez, stays home weekdays to take care of their newborn daughter and works weekends at a group home for the disabled.\n\nThe couple said they saw more than a bit of themselves in Rebekah Erler, the St. Anthony working mother of two preschoolers whom Obama highlighted Thursday.\n\n\u201cWe very much identify with her and her struggles,\u201d Daniel Rodriguez said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re a young family,\u201d his wife said. \u201cThe president actually kissed our baby. It was great.\u201d\n\nSome Republicans were quick to point out Erler\u2019s political work for Democrats, noting she had worked on the campaign of Democratic U.S. Sen. Patty Murray of Washington in 2004, a fact confirmed by Erler\u2019s online resume at LinkedIn.com.\n\n\u201cMost media won\u2019t expose President Obama\u2019s fraud lunch guest,\u201d wrote state Rep. Pat Garofalo, a Farmington Republican, on Twitter.\n\nBryant Cooper of St. Paul, a music and business student at McNally Smith College of Music, said Obama\u2019s presence alone at Lake Harriet made the lake part of history.\n\n\u201cThat he came down to see (the flooding caused by recent heavy rainfall), that was awesome,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cTo have it here, this makes it a historical spot now.\u201d\n\nFellow McNally Smith student Lizette Fonseca, a scheduler at an interpretation agency, said Congress could find more middle ground with the president.\n\n\u201cInstead of hating on him,\u201d she said, \u201clet\u2019s help him \u2026 and share the credit, like he said.\u201d\n\nObama\u2019s speech capped his two-day Twin Cities visit, which started Thursday with a town hall gathering at Minnehaha Park in Minneapolis, a stroll down St. Paul\u2019s Grand Avenue and then remarks at a Minneapolis fundraiser to benefit congressional Democrats.\n\nObama started Friday with an unannounced stop at a Minneapolis job training center, where he and Labor Secretary Tom Perez joined nine young mothers training for customer service jobs.\n\n\u201cAll of us start at different places. I was basically raised by a single mom,\u201d Obama said, adding that like these young women, his own mother benefited from grants and programs that enabled her to support her family.\n\nFrederick Melo and the Associated Press contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "twincities", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Twin Cities", "description": "It was billed as an economic policy address, but President Barack Obama used a friendly venue Friday in Minneapolis to unload on congressional Republicans, accusing them of doing the bidding of the\u2026", "title": "Obama unloads on Republicans during Lake Harriet speech on second day of Minnesota visit", "url": "http://www.twincities.com/2014/06/26/obama-unloads-on-republicans-during-lake-harriet-speech-on-second-day-of-minnesota-visit/", "image": {"width": 480, "identifier": "http://www.twincities.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/20140627__USObama3.jpg", "height": 313}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.twincities.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/20140627__USObama3.jpg?w=640", "site": "@pioneerpress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"pages": 276896490404}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.twincities.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/cropped-twincities-favicon-175x175.jpeg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-06-26T23:01:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-11-04T16:47:41+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "4Q2V-Cd9gt58y_XRmwqz3KOeAAum8arKhsEEIT-aIlc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "(AP Photo/Jim Mone)President Barack Obama delivers a speech at the Lake Harriet band shell in Minneapolis on Friday, June 27, 2014.\n\u201cMost media won\u2019t expose President Obama\u2019s fraud lunch guest,\u201d wrote state Rep.
