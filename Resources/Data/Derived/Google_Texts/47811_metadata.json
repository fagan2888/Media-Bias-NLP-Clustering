Just one doctor was manning the clinic that day, so he brought in the clinic receptionist and asked the receptionist to apply medical glue to the cut. But while the doctor held Vinnie, the receptionist \"kind of missed and he glued my son's eye shut,\" says Vavatsikos, who had initially assumed the colleague who was assisting was a \"nurse or medical student.\"\n\nVavatsikos says her son started yelling and the doctor looked like he was panicking\" and began swearing. Horrified, she rushed Vinnie to an emergency room, where an ophthalmologist successfully opened Vinnie's eye after cutting his eyelashes; he's not expected to have any long-term issues. An owner of the LeBlanc & Savaria Clinique M\u00e9dicale Priv\u00e9e in Blainville says the accident occurred when Vinnie moved\u2014while the doctor was performing the \"crucial medical act of holding the boy in place\"\u2014but the clinic refunded Vavatsikos' $150 payment. Apparently only a real doctor is allowed to apply such glue in Quebec. Meanwhile, studies show that tens or even hundreds of thousands of patients die in US hospitals annually because of medical errors, the New York Times reports. (This surgeon relied on memory during an operation, and that was a bad choice.)\n\n", "article_metadata": {"pubexchange": {"headline": "A Boy Went to the Doctor With a Cat Scratch Over His Eye, and Ended Up Having the Eye Glued Shut.
