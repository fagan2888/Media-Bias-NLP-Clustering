There is always the lure of do-it-yourself\u2014the number of people using tax software to file, like Intuit\u2019s TurboTax, increases by 6% annually, according to the Internal Revenue Service. And then there is the reverse exodus of people who have decided their financial lives are too complicated, and they need to hire a professional.\n\nWith so many changes, consistency takes a beating. If you are on the wrong end of it, you could end up drawing the dreaded attention of the IRS.\n\n\n\nHere are the items that can trip up taxpayers when they switch the way they do their taxes:\n\n1. Mileage logs\n\nWhen John Dundon took over his father\u2019s tax business after he passed away last July, the biggest surprise for the Denver, Colorado-based tax preparer was that road-warrior clients were not keeping mileage logs.\n\n\u201cBoundaries erode all the time between practitioner and taxpayer,\u201d Dundon says. Laziness seeps in disguised as trust, and years later, there are simply no logs.\n\nDundon tells his father\u2019s crossover clients they need a renewed zeal for paperwork\u2014get a GPS device or a smart phone app for next year. For 2014 taxes, he is asking clients meticulously through calendars and maps to sort it out.\n\n2. Rental property depreciation\n\nDepreciation is a deduction you can take on certain assets, like rental property. The tax impact can be pretty significant, especially if you are trying to off-set income like rent.\n\nThe dollar amount is determined by a formula you follow year-after-year, called a depreciation schedule, which could run almost the full course of a 30-year mortgage.\n\n\u201cYou definitely need that schedule. You can try to guess at it, and you\u2019d probably be okay, but you wouldn\u2019t be doing it 100% right,\u201d says tax preparer Anil Melwani, who runs his own firm, 212 Tax & Accounting Services, in New York.\n\nIf it was not done at all previously or done wrong? You\u2019ll need to file an amended return to correct it, Melwani says.\n\n3. Carryforward losses\n\nThe IRS allows taxpayers to take $3,000 in losses a year on investments, and to carry forward those losses indefinitely until the amount is all used up. But use it or lose it\u2014meaning, if you miss a year because you forget, you can\u2019t pick it up in the following years as if nothing happened.\n\nHarvey Bezozi, who has his own firm in Boca Raton, Florida, has a new client this year who will likely have to file amended returns because she skipped over this with her last preparer.\n\n4. Home office\n\nTaking the home office deduction? Stay consistent with the square footage of your home office. The best way to do that is to get out your tape measure and only include space that you use exclusively for work.\n\nIf there\u2019s a pingpong table in the middle of the basement study you\u2019re trying to claim, that\u2019s a no-go, says Dundon.\n\n5. Life changes\n\nThere is a lot that a new tax preparer\u2014or a tax software autobot\u2014can learn about you by just looking at your past returns, but their questionnaires will not catch everything. If you have a baby, buy a house, get divorced, have income in a foreign country or have job-hunting related expenses, you\u2019ve got to speak up.\n\nBut things can get missed when people do not know enough to know what they are missing. That\u2019s what drove a DIY-type like Ben Jaffe into the hands of a paid tax preparer this year.\n\nJaffe, a 29-year-old who works in PR in New York, bought a house in 2014 while his wife had a baby. He made the switch away from tax software because, he says, \u201cI wanted an expert opinion to verify that I was doing everything right.\u201d\n\nOne hour and $500 later, he\u2019s feeling confident: \u201cIt saved me a lot of time and stress.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0", "description": "A change in how you normally file your taxes and what you report on your return can lead to costly mistakes\u2014and attract attention from the IRS.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "MONEY.com", "description": "A break from how you normally file your taxes can lead to costly mistakes\u2014and attract the attention of the IRS.", "title": "How to Avoid Audit Red Flags When You Change Up Your Taxes", "url": "http://time.com/money/3741404/tax-audit-red-flags-filing-changes/", "image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/150311_ff_irsredflags.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1012", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/150311_ff_irsredflags.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1012"}, "title": "How to Avoid Audit Red Flags When You Change Up Your Taxes", "description": "A break from how you normally file your taxes can lead to costly mistakes\u2014and attract the attention of the IRS.", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "MONEY"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-tooltip": "Current & Breaking News | National & World Updates", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "p": {"domain_verify": "f48a8936c3fffc943fce516f2e3ff1d2"}, "fb": {"app_id": 53177223193}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/time2014/img/time-touch_icon_152.png", "application-name": "TIME", "google-site-verification": "nFxFQf8F4Xgg0b9Ap9rOUJzg7MY74LicbBIzsLo8yIg", "keywords": ", 2014 tax return, audit, audit red flags, income taxes, internal revenue service, irs, tax filing, taxes, turbotax", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/MoneyMagazine"}, "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://time.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/2cee445ea71a179ffd35ea91cf154905?s=16", "news_keywords": "taxes, tax return, audit, audit red flags, IRS, Internal Revenue Service, tax prep, income taxes, home office, mileage, rental property, carry forward losses"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf784\"", "article_summary": "That\u2019s what drove a DIY-type like Ben Jaffe into the hands of a paid tax preparer this year.\nLife changesThere is a lot that a new tax preparer\u2014or a tax software autobot\u2014can learn about you by just looking at your past returns, but their questionnaires will not catch everything.\nTaxes are one of the few constants in life, but what happens when you change the way you do your return?\nThere is always the lure of do-it-yourself\u2014the number of people using tax software to file, like Intuit\u2019s TurboTax, increases by 6% annually, according to the Internal Revenue Service.\nYou\u2019ll need to file an amended return to correct it, Melwani says."}
