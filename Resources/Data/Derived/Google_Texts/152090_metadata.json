You cannot get with your competitors and agree to raise or change prices.\u201d\n\nThe plaintiff is seeking an end to the surcharge practice as well as monetary damages exceeding $25,000 and a jury trial, according to the complaint.\n\nLoeb, reached Wednesday morning, said he had heard about the complaint but would not comment on the allegations. Citrin declined to comment, according to a spokeswoman. Lentz, through a spokeswoman, also declined to comment\u00ac\u2020Wednesday.\n\nLast year, Loeb reached out to \u201clike-minded\u201d restaurant owners about working together on a plan to pay for employees\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 health care coverage, according to the complaint and multiple media reports.\n\n\u201cIt looked like we weren\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t going to have to do it but we looked at each other and said, \u201a\u00c4\u00f2This is something we want to do,\u201a\u00c4\u00f4\u201d Loeb told the Daily Press last September. \u201cWe want to be able to grow up as a restaurant. The wellbeing of our staff is an incredibly important thing for us.\u201d\n\nLoeb also said at the time that implementing a 3-percent surcharge instead of raising menu prices was part of an effort to be more transparent to customers.\n\nBanding together on a surcharge kept any of the participating restaurants from being at a competitive disadvantage, the suit alleges.\n\n\u201cWe decided it would be a good thing to do it as a group,\u201d Citrin, of Melisse, told the Los Angeles Times last year. \u201cUsually when lots of people do things it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s easier to make change.\u201d\n\nSterrett, the attorney, said he was approached by the plaintiff and investigated the matter to determine whether a legally sound case could be built.\n\nHe noted that there are several other restaurants in the Los Angeles area with health care surcharges, but they are not named in the suit because he doesn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t have evidence that they conspired with competitors.\n\nSterrett added that he thinks the fee works against restaurant workers who receive tips.\n\n\u201cPeople tend to reduce their tips when they see this surcharge,\u201d he said. \u201cWe believe it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s actually taking money out of the employees\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 pockets.\u201d\n\nContact Jeff Goodman at 310-573-8351, jeff@smdp.com or on Twitter.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Several acclaimed Santa Monica restaurants with surcharges for employee health care are being accused of price-fixing.", "og": {"site_name": "Santa Monica Daily Press", "description": "Several acclaimed Santa Monica restaurants with surcharges for employee health care are being accused of price-fixing.
