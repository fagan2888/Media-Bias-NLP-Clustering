That was something we wanted to break up,\" Said said without elaborating.\n\n\"If we are in the middle of the core activities (of OPEC members), core discussions, our position will be better.\"\n\nIndonesia, until recently, had obtained nearly all of its foreign crude and oil products from trading company Petral, a unit of state-owned oil and gas firm Pertamina [PERTM.UL] that is being disbanded as part of efforts to clean up the graft-tainted oil sector.\n\nA separate unit within Pertamina is now handling the energy trading.\n\nIndonesia hopes reactivating its OPEC membership will help enhance relationships with top oil producers, potentially leading to long-term oil supply agreements and much needed investment in the country's energy infrastructure.\n\nThe government is currently in talks for long-term oil supply contracts with Iran, Oman and Saudi Arabia.\n\nAll OPEC members have backed Indonesia's request, Said said, with Saudi Oil Minister Ali al-Naimi in May telling him jokingly that Indonesia is \"our brother that just got away for awhile.\"\n\n\"I see a different paradigm in OPEC. Maybe in the past, OPEC only represented the thinking of producing countries,\" Said said. \"I think the attitude is more open.\"\n\nAn OPEC source said the rules on new members were relaxed in the case of Indonesia as it never officially left the group.\n\n\"This is good for Indonesia, (which) gets exposure to the market through OPEC, and it's good for OPEC to get an Asian member (and) more power,\" an OPEC source said.\n\n(Additional reporting by Fergus Jensen in JAKARTA and Rania El Gamal in DUBAI; Editing by Tom Hogue)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesia hopes its return to OPEC in December will bring Asia's t", "title": "Indonesia hopes rejoining OPEC will help ease reliance on oil traders", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2015/09/28/Indonesia-hopes-rejoining-OPEC-will-help-ease-reliance-oil-traders", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/opec-oil-prices_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2015/09/28/Indonesia-hopes-rejoining-OPEC-will-help-ease-reliance-oil-traders", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/opec-oil-prices_1.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesia hopes its return to OPEC in December will bring Asia's t", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdccc5\"", "article_summary": "\"If we are in the middle of the core activities (of OPEC members), core discussions, our position will be better.\"\nIndonesia hopes reactivating its OPEC membership will help enhance relationships with top oil producers, potentially leading to long-term oil supply agreements and much needed investment in the country's energy infrastructure.\nThe government is currently in talks for long-term oil supply contracts with Iran, Oman and Saudi Arabia.\nAll OPEC members have backed Indonesia's request, Said said, with Saudi Oil Minister Ali al-Naimi in May telling him jokingly that Indonesia is \"our brother that just got away for awhile.\"\n\"This is good for Indonesia, (which) gets exposure to the market through OPEC, and it's good for OPEC to get an Asian member (and) more power,\" an OPEC source said."}
