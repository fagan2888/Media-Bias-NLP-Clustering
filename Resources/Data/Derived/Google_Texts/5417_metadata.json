But that\u2019s what they got last week, in spades.\n\nFirst on Wednesday, Anthem said its longtime chief financial officer, Wayne DeVeydt, was leaving after nine years, \u201cdue to family commitments and philanthropic work.\u201d\n\nNews of his departure came out of the blue. DeVeydt, CFO since 2007, has been a central figure in helping Anthem navigate through the recession, deal with the Affordable Care Act, and negotiate the company\u2019s planned $54 billion acquisition of rival Cigna Corp.\n\nThen two days later, Cigna came out with a lightning bolt of its own in a regulatory filing, saying the deal with Anthem might drag into next year.\n\nSuch talk can send analysts into a tizzy, wondering if there\u2019s a serious issue that is emerging, such as doubt that regulators will bless the combination or even whether senior executives (or their boards) are having second thoughts.\n\nBut if analysts were thrown for a loop, they\u2019ve been good at hiding it. In fact, several have been sending out reassuring notes to their clients over the past few days, saying the deal seems to be on track and that DeVeydt\u2019s departure is nothing to be alarmed about.\n\nJ.P. Morgan, in a note today to clients, said \u201cwe believe in the explanation provided\u201d by Anthem over DeVeydt\u2019s departure.\n\n\u201cMany investors continue to speculate on possible motivations beyond those provided by the company,\u201d wrote J.P. Morgan analyst Gary P. Taylor. \u201cWe believe this conjecture is ill-founded. Mr. DeVeydt has an important array of priorities in his personal life that are inspirational, rather than questionable.\u201d\n\nOn the issue of a deal with Cigna possibly dragging out for months, Taylor also struck a reassuring note. He pointed out that 11 of the 26 states affected have approved the acquisition so far, and the Department of Justice\u2019s approval process is proceeding \u201cas expected.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor our part, we continue to believe DOJ is likely to approve the transaction with minimal divestitures,\u201d he wrote.\n\nOther analysts sent out similar calming words\u2013particular over Cigna\u2019s filing that the deal might take a few months longer than expected to wrap up.\n\n\u201cWe see nothing meaningful in the release that would change the direction of operations,\u201d wrote Barclay\u2019s analyst Joshua R. Raskin. He added: \u201cWe don\u2019t think this changes the likelihood of the deal closing but perhaps speaks to a later close in 2016.\u201d\n\nWedenbush analyst Sarah James wrote she was 80 percent confident that the deal would close\u2013up from 60 percent three months ago.\n\nAnthem\u2019s chief executive, Joe Swedish, said two weeks ago he expected the acquisition of Cigna to be completed in the second half of this year. On Friday, Jill Becher, an Anthem spokeswoman, said the insurer continued to expect the transaction to be completed on that timeline.\n\nThe stocks of both company have dipped\u2013but only a little\u2013since the talk Friday about the deal dragging out.\n\nAbout the most cautious note was sounded by Jeffries analyst David Windley, who said Cigna\u2019s talk of a delay \u201cseemed to be more than just a formality.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe company admitted that it may have underestimated the complexity, breadth, and depth of the review process,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThis signals that the deal, if approved, may close in the latter part\u201d of 2016 or even 2017.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Nothing to worry about here, folks.
