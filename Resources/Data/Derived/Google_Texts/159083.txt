Police say a repairman was critically injured when an MRI machine exploded at a New Jersey animal hospital.

Two other workers with a third-party MRI firm also suffered minor injuries.

Police tell The Record that the 60 animals and 100 employees at the Oradell Animal Hospital in Paramus were all safe and accounted for after the explosion shortly before noon on Friday. Authorities were investigating why the machine blew up.

Paramus Police Chief Kenneth Ehrenberg says helium was released during the explosion. The gas can be dangerous in a closed area. But officials say the area was ventilated and safe by mid-afternoon.

The name of the injured repair worker has not been released.
