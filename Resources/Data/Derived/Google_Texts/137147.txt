THE BIGGEST ADVICE - SHOP AROUND.

NADINE,

THIS YEAR THE PENALTY WILL BE MORE EXPENSIVE IF YOU

*DONT* BECOME INSURED...

BUT THERE ARE WAYS TO BE SMART ABOUT THE WAY YOU SHOP

FOR HEALTH INSURANCE.

IT'S THAT TIME OF YEAR AGAIN WHEN MANY WASHINGTONIANS

ARE DECIDING WHAT INSURANCE COVERAGE BEST SUITS THEIR

NEEDS.

NAVIGATING THE HEALTH PLAN FINDER CAN BE CONFUSING,

BUT THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO CAN HELP WITH NEW ENROLLMENTS

AND COVERAGE RENEWALS.

THESE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT NAVIGATORS SAY IT'S IMPORTANT

TO THINK CRITICALLY WHEN CHOOSING YOUR HEALTH CARE

NEEDS.

it really is individual as to what your health care

needs are, if you're someone who never goes to the

doctor, a bronze plan is going to make a lot of sense

because the premium is going to be low and its going

to be a high deductible, if you're somebody who needs

to see a doctor more regularly, if you're on medication,

especially if youre on medications, then to have a

plan where the premium is a little higher but the

deductible is lower is going to make sense.
