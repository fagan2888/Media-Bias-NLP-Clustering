Clement, a former U.S. solicitor general under President George W. Bush, who is representing the insurers.\n\n\u201cGovernments have a lot of freedom to impose taxes on the general population, but what they don\u2019t have is the ability to make one group of people pay for something that they don\u2019t get some benefit from.\u201d\n\nA spokeswoman for the D.C. Health Exchange declined to comment, but officials have previously defended the plan, saying that everyone benefits when more residents are insured.\n\nLike the 14 states that started online marketplaces with funding from President Obama\u2019s health-care law, the District has been grappling with an array of problems, including how to pay for the marketplace\u2019s ongoing cost. Unlike the others, the city does not have enough customers buying polices to copy the funding strategy that most states and the federal government adopted: a tax of a couple percentage points on medical plans sold on exchanges.\n\nA study recently pegged the D.C. exchange\u2019s cost per enrollee at nearly $12,500, second only to Hawaii. D.C. exchange officials warned that to cover costs, a whopping 17 percent tax would be needed on every plan issued on the D.C. Health Link Web site. The leading insurers who offer plans on the Web site cautioned that such a tax could erase many low-income residents\u2019 benefits of buying plans through the exchange.\n\nAs an alternative, exchange officials proposed spreading out the cost by taxing insurance products beyond those offered on the exchange: all health-related policies issued annually in the District. Mayor Vincent C. Gray (D) and the D.C. Council agreed.\n\nExchange officials have said they would soon begin collecting the 1 percent tax on long-term care, disability, vision, dental, hospital indemnity and dozens of other policies.\n\nIn all, in fact, the majority of the D.C. exchange\u2019s roughly $28 million budget would be funded by taxes on products not sold on its Web site.\n\nInsurers including Unum and Aflac have been among the most vocal opponents. They argue that their products \u2014 which in the event of a loss pay clients directly, not hospitals or doctors \u2014 are more financial planning tools than health insurance options.\n\n\u201cBy seeking to fund the operation of the D.C. Exchange in this manner, the District is seeking to obligate certain companies to endow a State-sponsored marketplace for the exclusive use of a small subset of health insurance issuers,\u201d read the complaint filed Thursday, which among others names Gray and Mila Kofman, the exchange\u2019s executive director.\n\nKofman could not be reached Thursday to comment, but during the spring, while lobbying Gray and others to back the plan, she said that issuers of all affected policies would benefit from a well-running D.C. exchange \u2014 namely, a healthier society that cashes in on policies less often.\n\nBut Kofman also acknowledged that the District had no choice: \u201cNo other state needs to do this because they have a higher population,\u201d Kofman said. \u201cWe are in a unique situation.\u201d\n\nTwo states have smaller populations than the District: Vermont and Wyoming. Vermont is paying for its exchange in part by raising rates on paid insurance claims. Wyoming is utilizing the federal exchange, which charges insurers 3.5 percent of premiums collected on plans sold on the exchange.\n\nIn its complaint, the ACLI said the District\u2019s unique need doesn\u2019t give it the right to override the Affordable Care Act, which grants states the right to fund exchanges only through fees and levies on products sold on exchanges.\n\nIn a statement, Gary Hughes, executive vice president and general counsel of ACLI, which represents 300 insurers, stressed that the group isn\u2019t trying to pick a fight with the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cOur concerns are solely focused on how D.C. has chosen to fund its own exchange,\u201d Hughes said. \u201cBecause these products are prohibited from even being sold on the exchange, the supplemental insurance carriers would be paying an assessment without seeing any benefit. In addition, the cost of the assessments will likely, and unfairly, impact the affordability of these products for consumers in the District of Columbia.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Insurers allege D.C. has overstepped law by taxing all insurance products to subsidize the city\u2019s exchange", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/byaaroncdavis", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Insurers allege D.C. has overstepped law by taxing all insurance products to subsidize the city\u2019s exchange", "title": "Broad new tax to subsidize Affordable Care Act in D.C. called unconstitutional by insurers", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/dc-politics/broad-new-tax-to-fund-dc-health-exchange-challenged-in-court/2014/07/03/5b4bdfd8-02d1-11e4-8572-4b1b969b6322_story.html", "image": "https://images.washingtonpost.com/?url=https://img.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/twp-3000x1568.jpg&w=1484&op=resize&opt=1&filter=antialias", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@byaaroncdavis"}, "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "dcpolitics, d.c. politics, affordable care act, aca, aca financing, affordable care act self sufficient, state health exchange financing, d.c. health exchange, d.c. health link, d.c. health insurance, american council of life insurers, paul clement, d.c. council, mayor vincent c. gray", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/byaaroncdavis"}, "eomportal-uuid": "5b4bdfd8-02d1-11e4-8572-4b1b969b6322", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "dcpolitics, d.c. politics, affordable care act, aca, aca financing, affordable care act self sufficient, state health exchange financing, d.c. health exchange, d.c. health link, d.c. health insurance, american council of life insurers, paul clement, d.c. council, mayor vincent c. gray"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd327b\"", "article_summary": "D.C. exchange officials warned that to cover costs, a whopping 17 percent tax would be needed on every plan issued on the D.C.
