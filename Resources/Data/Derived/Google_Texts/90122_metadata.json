Bush and Dick Cheney. Affordable health care for all Americans was Barack Obama\u2019s war, one started with noble intent, the way so many big ideas all the way back to Social Security have started.\n\nOnly now Obamacare, the way it will always be known, for better or worse, has become Obama\u2019s Iraq. It is something that dominates his second term now, dominates and threatens to suffocate the rest of his presidency, the way Iraq did with Bush, at least until the stock market caved in on Bush and on the candidacy of John McCain at the same time.\n\nYou want to know why our senators, Charles Schumer and Kirsten Gillibrand, are running toward Hillary Clinton so swiftly, three years before an election? Because they think it is a graceful way to get away from the current President on the dead run, that\u2019s why.\n\nEven crackpot Republicans \u2014 who have all the qualities of a good dog except loyalty \u2014 weren\u2019t nearly as shameless with their buyer\u2019s remorse before George W. Bush was halfway through his second term.\n\nFormer Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has been endorsed by Democratic Sens. Chuck Schumer and Kirsten Gillibrand, eager to distance themselves gracefully from President Obama, for a 2016 presdential run. (Lisa Lake/Getty Images)\n\nHere was Gillibrand on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week\u201d on Sunday, talking to guest host Martha Raddatz:\n\n\u201cI am on the bandwagon for Hillary Clinton in 2016,\u201d Gillibrand said, as if wanting to make sure she was right there at the front of the line with Schumer, New York\u2019s senior Democratic senator.\n\nThen Gillibrand, who didn\u2019t seem to have pulled any muscles as she raced away from Obama, was telling Raddatz that it wasn\u2019t as if she was shocked when Americans who already had health care began to get letters saying their policies had been shot out of a cannon.\n\nU.S. Sens. Kirsten Gillibrand and Charles Schumer have endorsed Hillary Clinton for President in 2016, even though the election is three years away. Some believe their support for Clinton is a way of distancing themselves from President Obama and his bothed health care rollout. (Alex Wong/Getty Images)\n\n\u201cWe all knew,\u201d was the money quote from Gillibrand, referring not just to herself and a small army of fellow politicians, including ones from Obama\u2019s own party, apparently aware that the Affordable Care Act would result in cancellations.\n\nShe was really saying that the President DIDN\u2019T know when he told everybody that if they were happy with their current plans they could keep them, a quote that he is wearing like a bonnet now. It is the way George H.W. Bush had to wear the same hat because he had told the country to read his lips about \u201cno new taxes.\u201d\n\nThis is where Barack Obama is five years from that night when he stood in Grant Park, when the amazing crowd and so much of the country cheered the fact that we had elected the first African-American President of the United States. With three years left in his second term, his presidency seems to work about as well as his Obamacare website.\n\nPresident George W. Bush paid a heavy political price for the Iraq War during his second term. President Obama faces a similar situatiion over the rollout of his Affordable Care Act. (PABLO MARTINEZ MONSIVAIS/AP)\n\nOf course there are those who have compared the whole current mess with Obamacare to Hurricane Katrina for George W. Bush, that storm seeming to swallow him up the way the water tried to swallow up New Orleans after the levees broke.\n\nSo all this time after Obama really ran against the Bush years for President, he is the one who looks weak and ineffective, and watches his approval ratings drop as if they have blocks of cement attached to them.\n\nOn national television Sunday, Kirsten Gillibrand talked about how the President and his people had \u201cfumbled\u201d the rollout of Obamacare, making it sound like some small thing. Well, yeah, the way Mark Sanchez\u2019s butt-fumble was a small thing against the Patriots one year ago this week.\n\nSen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) said on national television that President Obama had 'fumbled' the rollout of the Affordable Care Act and expressed her support for Hillary Clinton as a potential presidential candidate.\n\nThe real result of all this is that somehow the story has become the President himself \u2014 and not the fringe elements of the Republican Party, all those who were out to destroy his presidency before he even took the oath of office, those who have never made a secret of their hatred for Barack Obama. You wonder if they will hate Hillary as much if she is the next Democrat in the White House, if they can\u2019t stop her the way they couldn\u2019t stop Obama, twice.\n\nHe ran on hope and change and a better country, won because he was so much better than his haters, was President when we took out Bin Laden. But for the moment, maybe for the rest of his time in the White House, a brave, honorable vision for health care for all Americans has turned him into a punch line, and a punching bag.\n\nBarack Obama isn\u2019t the face of hope or change now. He is the face of a website, one that should probably have a new name:\n\nLameduck.com.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Mike Lupica", "twitter": {"description": "Affordable health care for all Americans was Barack Obama\u2019s war, one started with noble intent.", "title": "Obamacare turns into a war for the President", "url": "http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/obamacare-turns-war-president-article-1.1520159", "image": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.1520158.1384734899!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/obama-national-security.jpg", "site": "@nydailynews", "card": "summary"}, "sailthru.tags": "Iraq, Kirsten Gillibrand, Barack Obama, George W.
