The Republican party got something it wanted in the budget passed by Congress: a reduction in the amount of funds that will be available to insurers as loss offsets for insurers selling health plans via the public exchanges. But they may have widened a rift between not only the insurance vendors, but their investors as well.

Why the investors? Because Moodyâ€™s has signaled that the risk corridor fund limits included in the new budget represent a credit negative for those insurers doing business on the public exchanges.
