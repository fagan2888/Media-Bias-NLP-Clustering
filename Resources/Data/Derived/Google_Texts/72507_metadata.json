And Texas takes on more urgency because growth nationwide is slowing to a trickle.\n\nLast month, federal officials projected a small increase in sign-ups on the exchange for 2016. Total U.S. enrollment, expected to be about 10 million, would be half the number predicted earlier this year by the Congressional Budget Office.\n\nThat underscores the difficulty in converting hard-to-reach groups, even with a higher penalty for not carrying insurance. Texas, with 5 million uninsured, could add a jolt to the ACA numbers, but only if leaders can solve the politics and economics.\n\nIn recent weeks, three high-ranking federal officials visited Dallas to promote open enrollment on HealthCare.gov, which runs from November through January. President Barack Obama also challenged 20 cities to enroll the most uninsured, with Dallas as the lone entry from Texas.\n\n\u201cAll that\u2019s an indication we think this is an enormous opportunity\u201d to increase coverage, said Andy Slavitt, acting administrator for the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. \u201cWe\u2019re making progress, but there\u2019s a lot more progress to make.\u201d\n\nTexas, like the rest of the country, has had a sharp decline in the uninsured since the health law passed in 2010. Over 1 million Texans added coverage last year, according to census data.\n\nYet the state remains a great underachiever. Through June, 943,000 had coverage on the exchange, which was fewer than a third of those eligible. In contrast, half of those eligible in Florida enrolled, and that state has plenty of opposition to the law, too.\n\nThen there\u2019s the whiff on Medicaid. While other conservative states have rejected expansion, no other state has as much to gain. Over 1.3 million Texans would be eligible, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation.\n\nThat\u2019s almost 40 percent more than in Florida and more than twice the number in Georgia, the next-closest states that haven\u2019t adopted expansion.\n\nIf Texas officials were to propose their own Medicaid approach, \u201cthey\u2019d find a very eager audience,\u201d Slavitt said in an interview this week in Dallas.\n\n\u201cWe understand that would mean some compromise,\u201d Slavitt said. \u201cOur philosophy is to be open for business and use every opportunity to see if there\u2019s a path forward.\u201d\n\nThat sounds like a wide opening, especially as more conservative states join the program. This month, Montana became the 30th state, plus Washington D.C., to expand Medicaid. Ten had Republican governors, and Montana was the sixth to win concessions from federal regulators.\n\nThis week, Alabama\u2019s governor said he was considering expansion and gubernatorial candidates in Louisiana support it, too.\n\nIn the past, Texas hospitals have proposed expanding Medicaid with some favorite conservative features: personal responsibility, private market coverage and work incentives. But the plan couldn\u2019t get traction in Austin, where Gov. Greg Abbott\u2019s opposition hasn\u2019t wavered. He\u2019s suggested that federal dollars be awarded as a block grant, which is akin to asking for a blank check.\n\n\u201cIt ends the conversation and who wins?\u201d said Anne Dunkelberg of the Center for Public Policy Priorities in Austin.\n\nThere\u2019s no precedent for a block grant for Medicaid, she said. And setting the bar that high only makes an ideological point and does nothing to provide health care for people who don\u2019t have it.\n\nWhen Slavitt met with health care providers in Dallas this week, they talked about a different Medicaid program, because expansion to the working poor seems off the table.\n\n\u201cAsking for a block of money is a non-starter,\u201d said Stephen Love, CEO of the Dallas-Fort Worth Hospital Council, who met with Slavitt this week. \u201cPolitical policy shouldn\u2019t be health care policy.\u201d\n\nThe exchanges have a different challenge. They have to win over the public, not politicians, and the costs and benefits drive that calculation.\n\nWhen Slavitt visited Parkland Memorial Hospital, many people still didn\u2019t understand how the tax credits worked and the savings from shopping for the best deal, he said. This year, 85 percent of Texans got premium subsidies and 59 percent got help to reduce other out-of-pocket costs.\n\nFor 2016, almost three-quarters of Texas customers can get insurance for $75 a month or less with the tax credit, Slavitt said. Texas has added insurers and the website has new tools to show which plans cover your doctors and prescriptions.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t realize there are so many options,\u201d Slavitt said. \u201cWe have to keep educating people.\u201d\n\nCritics say that many understand the value proposition and aren\u2019t willing to pay for what they\u2019re getting. Most plans on the exchange have high deductibles, in part because low premiums are the most important feature for customers.\n\nThe sick are quick to sign up, but healthy people are having second thoughts, said Devon Herrick, senior fellow for the National Center for Policy Analysis. Many are dropping out before the end of the year to save on monthly premiums, betting they\u2019ll be fine until next year\u2019s plan kicks in.\n\n\u201cPeople are realizing they\u2019re paying thousands in premiums and deductibles, and not getting that much direct benefit,\u201d Herrick said.\n\nLast year, over 7 million nationwide opted to pay the penalty for not having coverage, he said. That shows how many are willing to go without \u2014 and that health care reform still has far to go.\n\nOn Twitter:\n\n@mitchschnurman", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Feds come to Dallas to pump up enrollment for HealthCare.gov and start a conversation on Medicaid.", "og": {"description": "The Feds come to Dallas to pump up enrollment for HealthCare.gov and start a conversation on Medicaid.", "title": "Texas still falls short on coverage", "url": "http://www.dallasnews.com/business/columnists/mitchell-schnurman/20151113-texas-still-falls-short-on-coverage.ece", "image": {"width": 1280, "identifier": "http://www.dallasnews.com/business/columnists/mitchell-schnurman/20151113-nb_10slavitt1aj.ece/BINARY/original/NB_10slavitt1AJ", "height": 853}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "type": "article"}, "LastModifiedDate": "2015-11-16T01:22:18Z", "twitter": {"site": "@dallasnews", "card": "summary", "creator": "@dallasnews"}, "PublishDate": "2015-11-13T21:08:07Z", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Texas still falls short on coverage\", \"link\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/business/columnists/mitchell-schnurman/20151113-texas-still-falls-short-on-coverage.ece\", \"image_url\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/business/columnists/mitchell-schnurman/20151113-nb_10slavitt1aj.ece/BINARY/original/NB_10slavitt1AJ\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"2534418\", \"pub_date\": \"2015-11-13T21:08:07Z\", \"section\": \"Mitchell Schnurman\", \"author\": \"Mitchell Schnurman\", \"tags\": [\"dallas\", \"dallas fort worth\", \"dallas news\", \"dallas fort worth news\", \"dfw news\", \"dallas local news\", \"dallas fort worth local news\", \"dallas newspaper\", \"dallas morning news\", \"dallas morning news newspaper\"]}", "fb": {"admins": 1043783589, "page_id": 20946638799, "app_id": 258290334265148}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "cXenseParse": {"recs": {"image": "http://www.dallasnews.com/business/columnists/mitchell-schnurman/20151113-nb_10slavitt1aj.ece/ALTERNATES/w660/NB_10slavitt1AJ", "publishtime": "2015-11-13T21:08:07Z"}}, "news_keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper"}, "article_summary": "Texas, with 5 million uninsured, could add a jolt to the ACA numbers, but only if leaders can solve the politics and economics.\nThat shows how many are willing to go without \u2014 and that health care reform still has far to go.\nIn the past, Texas hospitals have proposed expanding Medicaid with some favorite conservative features: personal responsibility, private market coverage and work incentives.\nAnd setting the bar that high only makes an ideological point and does nothing to provide health care for people who don\u2019t have it.\nPresident Barack Obama also challenged 20 cities to enroll the most uninsured, with Dallas as the lone entry from Texas."}
