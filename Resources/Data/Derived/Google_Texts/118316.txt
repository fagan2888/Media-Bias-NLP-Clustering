Fox News' Bill Hemmer apologized for their inaccurate graphic depicting healthcare signups, after people started slamming the network for misleading information.

Fox News was covering the approaching deadline for people to sign up for the healthcare exchanges under the Affordable Care Act, when they showed 6 million signups on March 27 and then a significant gap to the goal of 7 million or more on April 1.

The network was slammed for falsely presenting the facts about the healthcare signup progress. They quickly showed a more accurate graphic, and then host Bill Hemmer apologized while displaying the corrected graphic.

"Here was what that graphic should have looked like," Hemmer said, "that was our mistake -- correction noted."
