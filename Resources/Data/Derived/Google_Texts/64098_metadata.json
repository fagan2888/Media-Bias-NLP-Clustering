Many of the metals and minerals used in U.S. defense applications aren\u2019t exactly household names. There\u2019s bismuth, used in defense thermo-electrics to capture \u2018waste heat\u201d and channel it back into weapons systems power sources. Weapons builders need iridium \u2013 used in aircraft engines, satellites and rocket propulsion\u2013 as an alternative to America\u2019s present reliance on Russian supply. In the case of tellurium, used in thermal imaging and navigation systems, present tellurium production, already sharply limited, will soon drop to zero, increasing U.S. dependency on China, Russia and Japan. Rhenium and molybdenum are essential to high-performance alloys used in jet turbines and other defense systems \u2013 as is more cobalt, used in jet engine super-alloys and samarium-cobalt permanent magnets. As the Pentagon study notes:\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cCobalt and copper output in DRC may increase substantially in the near future, assuming political and economic stability continues in the eastern part of that country.\u201d\n\nBut then again: \u201cChinese firms have been buying control of DRC mines to ensure supplies of raw material for cobalt refining.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s six metals and minerals with little in common, except for one thing: All are by-products of copper mining. Copper \u2013 like nickel and zinc \u2013 is a kind of gateway metal, providing access to other elements present in concentrations too minor to mine in their own right. Close the door on copper production, and you\u2019re making a difficult situation far worse for national defense planners tasked with securing reliable supplies of critical metals. Given that every crisis is a come-as-you-are event \u2013 your options are only as strong as your prior planning \u2013 failure today to provide reliable sources of supply will translate into battlefield loses in some unwished-for future.\n\nBut can\u2019t U.S. defense system designers work around potential shortfalls, substituting more plentiful metals for those in short supply? They\u2019re working on just that. Take potential shortfalls in tin and antimony \u2013 used in everything from old-school bearings and ammunition to high-tech touch screens, and Forward-Looking Infra-Red imagers.\n\nIn both cases, Pentagon planners note that, for some defense applications, there is a metal you can use as a substitute: Copper.\n\nThere\u2019s only one problem: This year, the U.S. will consume more copper than it produces -- 600,000 metric tons more.\n\nShortfalls for nine metals and minerals; supply dependencies on China and Russia; competition for scarce resources with Japan; concerns about sourcing from the conflict metals mines of DRC Congo: These factors reflect the nature of today\u2019s global economy \u2013 and the very real pressures it creates for defense planners.\n\nNot everyone feels the Pentagon planners\u2019 pain. There was controversy this winter that a federal land exchange related to an Arizona copper project was included in the 2015 National Defense Authorization Act \u2013 the omnibus bill that funds all aspects and operations of the U.S. military establishment -- with some critics claiming the swap\u2019s inclusion \u201chas nothing to do with \u2018defense.\u2019\u201d But as the new Pentagon report makes clear, domestic copper production is critically important. By weight, copper remains the second most widely used material in weapons platforms, and as a previous Department of Defense report indicates, the inability to source copper has already resulted in a \u201csignificant weapon system production delay for DoD.\" The same is true of copper by-products molybdenum and tellurium \u2013 making copper the only primary metal whose absence has affected multiple weapons systems.\n\nAnd that\u2019s what\u2019s wrong with the current debate on mining. It has devolved into a binary battle: on the one side, pro-mining advocates citing jobs and GDP -- on the other, anti-mining activists defending the environment.\n\nAnd the anti-mining forces are winning: The U.S. attracts less than half of the minerals exploration investment we did 20 years ago \u2013 and it takes twice as long to push a new mine through the permitting process as it does in other industrial democracies.\n\nFighting against mining is portrayed as a moral cause, but it\u2019s cynical, really. After all, if you stop mines in the U.S., the metals in the stuff we buy will just come from somewhere else. Do anti-mining activists stop to think of where the metals come from in the laptops and smart phones they use to organize their protests?\n\nBut when the same metal that powers smart phones propels smart bombs \u2013 and import dependency becomes a weapon in the hands of an adversary \u2013 it turns out it really does matter where our metals come from.\n\nIt\u2019s time for this debate to make room for a new thought: in our tech-driven world, metals access is a matter of national security.\n\nPentagon planners are staying up nights tracking down every known metals dependency that could hamper our Armed Forces and idle our advanced weaponry. Shouldn\u2019t we welcome resource projects that provide our warfighters the metal they need to keep us safe?\n\nMcGroarty, president of the non-profit American Resources Policy Network, an experts-group focused on domestic resource supply, has participated in the shortfall analysis informing the last two National Defense Stockpile Requirement Reports.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "In our tech-driven world, metals access is a matter of national security.", "description": "In our tech-driven world, metals access is a matter of national security.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "rdfs": {"label skos": {"prefLabel": "Congress Blog"}}, "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "In our tech-driven world, metals access is a matter of national security.", "title": "Got copper?
