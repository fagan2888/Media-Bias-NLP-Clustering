As Breitbart News reported:\n\nA record 1.7 million graduating seniors took the SAT test last year. With a highest possible score this year of 800 on each SAT section, according to the College Board, students scored a worst since 1999 math score of 511, worst since 1972 reading score of 495, and worst writing score since the section was added in 2005.\n\nBut Ze\u2019ev Wurman, former senior policy adviser with the U.S. Department of Education under President George W. Bush, tells Breitbart News these disappointing results are still on the old SAT college admissions test.\n\n\u201cConsequently, they represent a trend that does not speak well of the frantic implementation of Common Core that has been taking place around the nation in recent years,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cNext year the College Board will roll out a major change in the SAT that will make comparisons with past results impossible, and allow Common Core proponents to argue \u2018these are different and better tests, so don\u2019t pay attention to past results,'\u201d Wurman states. \u201cWe are lucky that this year\u2019s SAT has not changed yet, so the decline is clearly visible and cannot be hidden or denied.\u201d\n\nThe College Board president is David Coleman, the so-called \u201carchitect\u201d of the Common Core standards.\n\nWurman reflects on a warning given in 1993 by Zalman Usiskin, one of the founders of reform math:\n\nLet us drop this overstated rhetoric about all the old tests being bad. Those tests were used because they were quite effective in fitting a particular mathematical model of performance \u2013 a single number that has some value to predict future performance. Until it can be shown that the alternate assessment techniques do a better job of prediction, let us not knock what is there. The mathematics education community has forgotten that it is poor performance on the old tests that rallied the public behind our desire to change. We cannot pick up the banner but then say the test are no measure of performance. We cannot have it both ways.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, the first thing reformers do these days is to change the test to obscure the track record,\u201d Wurman asserts.\n\n\u201cHence the new Common Core tests, hence the \u2018re-adjusted\u2019 PSAT and SAT,\u201d he adds. \u201cAnd more to come, all under the guise of \u2018we need to better measure what students know.\u2019 In reality, it is like shooting an arrow and then painting a target around it.\u201d\n\nWurman has been studying a similar situation regarding the Common Core-aligned statewide tests in California for grades K-12. He and colleague Bill Evers, a research fellow at Stanford University\u2019s Hoover Institution and a former U.S. assistant secretary of education, wrote in an op-ed last week at The Sacramento Bee that the California Department of Education \u201chas been acting in a way that would have made the Soviet government proud.\u201d\n\nThe two former members of the California State Academic Standards Commission continued:\n\nThe department has maintained a database of the results on the statewide K-12 standardized tests since their inception in 1998. This database allowed parents and reporters to easily see detailed test results from any school and grade level in the state and compare them with any other school or school district. That helped parents to evaluate the quality of their child\u2019s school, helped set district priorities and helped evaluate trends at schools and districts over time. The easy availability of this data was an important part of public school accountability. Yet state bureaucrats have a problem. Students across the state took the new Common Core test earlier this year, and insiders are saying that the results are dismal. So first, the bureaucrats delayed the publication of the results from mid-August (as called for in state law) to Sept. 9. Then until an about-face last week, they blocked the public from being able to compare the last 15 years of test results with the current Common Core results, obscuring the new low level of performance.\n\nWurman and Evers describe the situation of California students\u2019 test scores in history and science from several years available for comparison on the state\u2019s website, but not so for math or English \u2013 the two areas now covered by the Common Core standards.\n\nFortunately, as the colleagues note, media inquiries about transparency led to the math and English test data being restored to the state\u2019s website.\n\nThe California Department of Education\u2019s behavior, they add, \u201cis all too similar to that of authoritarian governments that excel in hiding information from their people.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "when the new SAT is out next year, changes to the college admissions test won't allow scores from the new version to be compared to old ones.", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "when the new SAT is out next year, changes to the college admissions test won't allow scores from the new version to be compared to old ones.", "title": "Hiding Common Core\u2019s Damage: New SAT Won\u2019t Allow Comparison To Prior Years\u2019 Scores - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/09/SAT-Getty.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/09/07/hiding-common-cores-damage-new-sat-wont-allow-comparison-to-prior-years-scores/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "when the new SAT is out next year, changes to the college admissions test won't allow scores from the new version to be compared to old ones.", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/09/SAT-Getty.jpg", "title": "Hiding Common Core\u2019s Damage: New SAT Won\u2019t Allow Comparison To Prior Years\u2019 Scores - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "College Board, Common Core, Common Core tests, David Coleman, SAT, SAT scores, transparency,Big Government, Data, Education,SAT", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Big Government", "tag": "transparency", "published_time": "2015-09-07T06:49:40-07:00", "categories": "Big Government,Education,Data"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERThis year\u2019s high school students\u2019 SAT scores fell once again, to the lowest level in 40 years.\n\u201cHence the new Common Core tests, hence the \u2018re-adjusted\u2019 PSAT and SAT,\u201d he adds.\nStudents across the state took the new Common Core test earlier this year, and insiders are saying that the results are dismal.\n\u201cConsequently, they represent a trend that does not speak well of the frantic implementation of Common Core that has been taking place around the nation in recent years,\u201d he says.\nThen until an about-face last week, they blocked the public from being able to compare the last 15 years of test results with the current Common Core results, obscuring the new low level of performance."}
