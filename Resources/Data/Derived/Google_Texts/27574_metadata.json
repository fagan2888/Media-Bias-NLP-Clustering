Now the administrator spends more time on quality reporting, she said.\n\nElectronic medical records have slowed the business down and made it more complicated to enter data, Buckingham added.\n\nThe ophthalmologist believes certain requirements of the federal health care law have cost her time with patients, effectively turning her position \u201cinto data entry specialist.\u201d\n\nBuckingham said she favors health care reform to enable a system in which \u201cthere is transparency in pricing\u201d and insurance companies act in the best interest of patients.\n\nThe candidate\u2019s other stated priorities include:\n\n\u2022 \u201cProtect the unborn and stand up for life.\u201d\n\n\u2022 \u201cCut wasteful spending and lower taxes.\u201d\n\n\u2022 \u201cSeal the border and eradicate sanctuary cities.\u201d\n\n\u2022 \u201cEmpower parents in their children\u2019s education.\u201d\n\nIn regard to the unborn and the issue of abortion, Buckingham said, \u2018I hope that there\u2019s a day that abortions are illegal.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019ve seen by the Planned Parenthood videos that there were terrible atrocities against mankind \u2026,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI believe abortion should only be allowed in cases where it\u2019s absolutely medically necessary, and taxpayers should not have to fund abortions,\u201d Buckingham\u2019s campaign website states.\n\nThe candidate did not mention specific goals for reducing spending, but she believes in general there is excessive bureaucracy in the government.\n\nBuckingham indicated her objective of sealing the Texas border with Mexico would include a combination of putting physical barriers in place and maintaining a presence of law enforcement.\n\nThe candidate supports \u201cpressuring Governor Abbott to use his authority to seal the border with the Texas National Guard.\u201d She also advocates cutting off state funds from \u201csanctuary cities\u201d that defy immigration law.\n\nBuckingham has served as an appointee to the Texas Sunset Advisory Commission since 2013.
