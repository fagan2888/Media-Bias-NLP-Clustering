College Hockey: Dartmouth, Grant getting hot



Don't look now, but the Dartmouth hockey team and goalie Charles Grant are hot.



The Big Green earned their third straight win, fifth in the last six games, by beating No. 18 St. Lawrence, 4-2, on Saturday night at Thompson Arena in Hanover.

Grant, a senior from Nova Scotia, has been especially impressive in the streak. On Saturday night, he made a season-high 37 saves, including many difficult ones, as the Saints outshot Dartmouth, 39-22.

Troy Crema and Brett Patterson scored power-play goals as the Big Green built a 2-0 lead early in the second period. After SLU’s Brian Ward drew the visitors close, Jack Barre potted his team-leading seventh goal at 18:16 of the second period.

The Saints’ Alexander Dahl scored at 10:21 of the third period, but Brad Schierhorn notched an empty netter with 7 seconds remaining.



“What a fantastic game between two teams with a lot of skill on the ice,” said Dartmouth coach Bob Gaudet. “I was really pleased with the way our guys played all weekend to come away with four points against those two teams (St. Lawrence and Clarkson).

..

“Our goaltender was outstanding tonight,” said Gaudet. “Chuck has been so good for us lately and tonight was another example of that. The team really feeds off his composure and play back there.”



Dartmouth (8-8-1 overall and 4-5-1 in the ECAC) jumped to No. 19 in the PairWise rankings. The Big Green visit Cornell and Colgate next weekend.

Castleton 2, St. Anselm 1: At Sullivan Arena in Goffstown, Vin D’Amato’s marker was all the Hawks (8-6-1 overall, 5-5-1 in the NEHC) could muster.



Salem State 4, Plymouth State 1 : At Hanaway Rink in Plymouth, Londonderry’s Ryan Callahan scored in the Panthers’ first conference loss. PSU, ranked 14th and 15th in Division III polls, dropped to 12-3 overall and 7-1 in the MASCAC. Salem State improved to 10-5 and 6-2 in the MASCAC.
