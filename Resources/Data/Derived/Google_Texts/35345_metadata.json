If you\u2019re not, that\u2019s totally cool. \u2026 [But] as a God guy, this is as big to me as when the Democrats denied God three times during their convention. That was just not a coincidence.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut there is a much bigger theme here that we need to look for, and that is the government is on a freight train of control,\u201d Beck continued. \u201cIt is out of control, and picking up more and more steam.\u201d\n\nThe full episode of The Glenn Beck Program, along with many other live-streaming shows and thousands of hours of on-demand content, is available on just about any digital device.
