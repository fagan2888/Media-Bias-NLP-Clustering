In 2011, it adopted a form of neighboring Canada\u2019s government-financed health care and promised to implement it by 2017. (And Jonathan Gruber was a key architect of this plan as well as of Obamacare.) This week, however, Governor Peter Shumlin, a Democrat, admitted the state couldn\u2019t afford the plan\u2019s $2 billion price tag and consequent sky-high taxes, and pulled the plug. The lessons for Obamacare are obvious and profound.\n\nScott Milne, the little-known Republican who opposed Shumlin in last month\u2019s election and came within 1 percentage point of winning the most votes, isn\u2019t surprised. \u201cDuring the campaign I said that single-payer is dead \u2014 I\u2019m telling you that now, and Peter Shumlin\u2019s going to wait until after the election,\u201d Milne told the Burlington Free Press. Milne is still running for governor, since Shumlin won only 46 percent of the vote, and Vermont requires the state legislature to elect the governor in January if no candidate wins the majority. Despite his prescience, however, Milne is highly unlikely to persuade the Democratic legislature to substitute him for Shumlin.\n\nBut Milne certainly has won a moral victory. Lieutenant Governor Phil Scott, a Republican, called the cancellation of singe-payer a victory for \u201covertaxed Vermonters.\u201d Noting that the state\u2019s fiscal plan for implementing single-payer was now almost two years late, he said in a statement: \u201cWe\u2019ve already spent far too much money exploring this idea, and the discussion has paralyzed our business community.\u201d\n\nBusiness realities weighed heavily in Shumlin\u2019s retreat. His experts calculated the state would need an 11.5 percent payroll tax and an additional income tax of up to 9.5 percent. That\u2019s California-style taxation. \u201cMy health-care costs would have gone up by 61 percent if that plan had gone through,\u201d Win Smith, the owner of the Sugarbush ski resort, told reporters. \u201cIf there were that 9 percent [income tax] on employees, many would have been paying more than they\u2019re paying now. It would have been a lose-lose.\u201d Shumlin admitted it would be irresponsible for him to be \u201cpushing prematurely for single-payer\u201d when \u201cthe risk of economic shock is too high at this time.\u201d\n\nBut like any good liberal, Shumlin insisted on painting a rosy fantasy that he would bring back a single-payer plan. \u201c[Medicare] took 31 years to become law. Medicaid took 50 years to pass; Social Security took 25 years,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cOur time will come.\u201d James Haslam of the Vermont Workers\u2019 Center wasn\u2019t buying it, calling Governor Shumlin\u2019s retreat \u201ca slap in the face\u201d of single-payer backers.\n\nHealth-care experts from outside Vermont point out some of the implications. \u201cIt\u2019s a very liberal state, and its leaders spent years trying to design a system that would work,\u201d Grace-Marie Turner of the Galen Institute observes. \u201cIf Vermont can\u2019t make it work, single-payer can\u2019t work anywhere in the country where the economy has free and competitive markets. It\u2019s more evidence that centralized government health care is simply not workable in America.\u201d\n\nVermont\u2019s decision should embolden Republicans in Congress and state governments to fight harder against Obamacare. While President Obama insists he will tolerate no changes in his program that he doesn\u2019t unilaterally declare through personal whim, his stubbornness may be more difficult to sustain in coming months.
