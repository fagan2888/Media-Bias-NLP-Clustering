Make no mistake about our resolve.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhile there are many things we can endure, redefining marriage is so fundamental to the natural order and the common good that this is the line we must draw and one we cannot and will not cross,\u201d the pledge states.\n\nThe signees are a who\u2019s who of religious leaders including former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, former U.S. Senator Rick Santorum, National Religious Broadcasters president Jerry Johnson, Pastor John Hagee, and Franklin Graham, president and CEO of the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association and Samaritan\u2019s Purse.\n\nThe pledge was crafted by Rick Scarborough, the president of Vision America Action; James Dobson, the founder of Family Talk Radio; and Mat Staver, the founder of Liberty Counsel.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re sending a warning to the Supreme Court and frankly any court that crosses the line on the issue of marriage,\u201d Staver told me.\n\nHe said that once same-sex marriage is elevated to the level of protected status \u2013 it will transform the face of society and will result in the \u201cbeginning of the end of Western Civilization.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are essentially saying that boys and girls don\u2019t need moms and dads \u2013 that moms and dads are irrelevant,\u201d Staver said. \u201cGender becomes pointless when government adopts same-sex marriage. It creates a genderless relationship out of a very gender-specific relationship. It says that it doesn\u2019t matter and that two moms or two dads are absolutely equivalent to a mom and a dad.\u201d\n\nDobson said the legalization of same-sex marriage could fracture the nation.\n\n\u201cThe institution of marriage is fundamental and it must be defended,\u201d he told me. \u201cIt\u2019s the foundation for the entire culture. It\u2019s been in existence for 5,000 years. If you weaken it or if you undermine it \u2013 the entire superstructure can come down. We see it as that important.\u201d\n\nAnd that means the possibility of Christians \u2013 people of faith \u2013 engaging in acts of civil disobedience.\n\n\u201cYes, I\u2019m talking about civil disobedience,\u201d Staver said. \u201cI\u2019m talking about resistance and I\u2019m talking about peaceful resistance against unjust laws and unjust rulings.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s quite a shocking statement. So I asked Mr. Staver to clarify his remarks.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m calling for people to not recognize the legitimacy of that ruling because it\u2019s not grounded in the Rule of Law,\u201d he told me. \u201cThey need to resist that ruling in every way possible. In a peaceful way \u2013 they need to resist it as much as Martin Luther King, Jr. resisted unjust laws in his time.\u201d\n\nScarborough said the pledge was meant to be forthright and clear.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re facing a real Constitutional crisis if the Supreme Court rules adversely from our perspective on same-sex marriage,\u201d he told me. For me there\u2019s no option. I\u2019m going to choose to serve the Lord. And I think that thousands of other pastors will take that position and hundreds of thousands \u2013 if not millions of Christians.\u201d\n\nScarborough is urging pastors across the nation to sign the pledge.\n\nHe referenced the \u201coutrageous penalties\u201d being assessed against people of faith simply because they don\u2019t want to participate in a same-sex union.\n\nAn Oregon bakery is facing a $135,000 fine for refusing to make a cake for a lesbian wedding and a Washington State florist faces fines for refusing to participate in a gay wedding.\n\n\u201cChristians are being declared the lawbreakers when we are simply living by what we have always believed, and by a set of laws that the culture historically has agreed to,\u201d he said. \u201cRight now the courts are changing the playing field and declaring that what the natural eye can see and natural law reveals is not truth. ... What will we do, and how will we respond?\u201d\n\nDobson said there\u2019s no doubt that LGBT activists are targeting Christian business owners.\n\n\u201cFor about 50 years the homosexual community has had as its goal to change the culture, to change the ideology and if necessary \u2013 to force people who don\u2019t agree by use of the courts,\u201d Dobson told me. \u201cI think there\u2019s a collision here and we can all see it and where it\u2019s going to go is anybody\u2019s guess \u2013 but it is serious.\u201d\n\nTo be clear \u2013 the men and women who courageously signed this pledge did so knowing the hell storm that is about to be unleashed on them \u2013 and their families.\n\n\u201cWe have no choice,\u201d Staver told me. \u201cWe cannot compromise our clear biblical convictions, our religious convictions.", "article_metadata": {"description": "We will not obey.\r\n\r\nThats the blunt warning a group of prominent religious leaders is sending to the Supreme Court of the United States as they consider same-sex marriage..05/26/2016 20:14:07PM EST.", "author": "Todd Starnes", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "We will not obey.\r\n\r\nThats the blunt warning a group of prominent religious leaders is sending to the Supreme Court of the United States as they consider same-sex marriage.", "title": "Todd Starnes - \u2018We Will Not Obey\u2019: Christian Leaders Threaten Civil Disobedience if Supreme Court Legalizes Gay Marriage", "url": "http://townhall.com/columnists/toddstarnes/2015/04/28/we-will-not-obey-christian-leaders-threaten-civil-disobedience-if-supreme-court-legalizes-gay-marriage-n1991740", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2015/118/2015-04-28T131007Z_1_LYNXMPEB3R0LQ_RTROPTP_3_USA-COURT-GAYMARRIAGE.JPG", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "We will not obey.\r\n\r\nThats the blunt warning a group of prominent religious leaders is sending to the Supreme Court of the United States as they consider same-sex marriage.", "title": "Todd Starnes - \u2018We Will Not Obey\u2019: Christian Leaders Threaten Civil Disobedience if Supreme Court Legalizes Gay Marriage", "url": "http://townhall.com/columnists/toddstarnes/2015/04/28/we-will-not-obey-christian-leaders-threaten-civil-disobedience-if-supreme-court-legalizes-gay-marriage-n1991740", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2015/118/2015-04-28T131007Z_1_LYNXMPEB3R0LQ_RTROPTP_3_USA-COURT-GAYMARRIAGE.JPG", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "\u2018We Will Not Obey\u2019: Christian Leaders Threaten Civil Disobedience if Supreme Court Legalizes Gay Marriage, Todd Starnes, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "\u201cWe\u2019re sending a warning to the Supreme Court and frankly any court that crosses the line on the issue of marriage,\u201d Staver told me.\n\u201cWe\u2019re facing a real Constitutional crisis if the Supreme Court rules adversely from our perspective on same-sex marriage,\u201d he told me.\n\u201cWe respectfully warn the Supreme Court not to cross that line,\u201d read a document titled, Pledge in Solidarity to Defend Marriage.\n\u201cWe will not obey.\u201dThat\u2019s the blunt warning a group of prominent religious leaders is sending to the Supreme Court of the United States as they consider same-sex marriage.\n\u201cGender becomes pointless when government adopts same-sex marriage."}
