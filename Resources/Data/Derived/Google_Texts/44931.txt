Karl Hennessy, CEO of Aon Global Broking, discusses global unrest and what businesses need to be aware of.

Developed countries across Europe are becoming more and more vulnerable to terrorism, mostly due to the rising power of the Islamic State (ISIS) and other Islamist extremist groups, a global risk consultancy has warned.

The risk of an extremist terrorist or political attack poses a threat to business across Europe but seven countries in particular are in particular danger: France, Germany, Ireland, Denmark, Norway, Belgium and Estonia.

"Top risks for business include increased terrorism threats across developed economies, and a progressively uncertain and dangerous geopolitical environment, where the risk of armed conflict is growing amid changing and unstable regional balances of power," said Aon in a report published on Tuesday with the Risk Advisory Group.

The risk to western European countries was highlighted in January this year, when gunmen claiming affinity to Al-Qaeda killed 17 people in a series of attacks in Paris. Norway, meanwhile, saw 77 people slaughtered in 2011 by a far-right terrorist Anders Behring Breivik.
