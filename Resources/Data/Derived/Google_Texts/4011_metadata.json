Earl L. \"Buddy\" Carter (R-GA) says he has witnessed a \"tremendous evolution\" in the pharmacy profession in his more than 30 years as a pharmacist. \"The clinical foundation and training of a pharmacist graduating today is leaps and bounds above where I started my practice,\" he notes. \"However, one thing has not changed: a pharmacists\u2019 role in patient care goes well beyond dispensing medications.\" Carter notes that pharmacists are limited with the care they can provide because they are not recognized under the Social Security Act as health care providers eligible for Medicare Part B reimbursement. \"As such, many patients are denied the full benefit of a pharmacist\u2019s expertise in maximizing the effectiveness of their care,\" he points out. The exclusion of pharmacists from sections of the Social Security Act also prevents the use of pharmacists\u2019 services in new care delivery models created by the Affordable Care Act. Carter says that in the House of Representatives, a bipartisan majority of 272 members have cosponsored the Pharmacy and Medically Underserved Areas Enhancement Act introduced by Rep. Brett Guthrie (R-KY). The legislation gives pharmacists provider status \"allowing them to rightfully join the health care team to improve patient outcomes and reduce overall health care costs,\" says Carter. Companion legislation in the Senate has garnered 42 cosponsors.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "American Pharmacists Association", "description": "Rep.
