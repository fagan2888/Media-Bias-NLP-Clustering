SYDNEY, Australia—In one of the biggest deals in the Asia-Pacific region so far this year, General Electric Co. has agreed to sell the consumer-lending business of GE Capital in Australia and New Zealand to an investor group including KKR & Co. and Deutsche Bank AG—a pact with an enterprise value of about $A8.2 billion ($6.26 billion).

The move comes as GE GE, -0.23% sheds more of its banking businesses globally amid investor pressure to return the conglomerate better known for its jet engines, power turbines and CT scanners to its industrial focus.

The investor group also includes $10 billion alternative-investment firm Värde Partners, which has offices in Minneapolis, Minn., London and Singapore. Further details of the deal weren’t disclosed.

Shareholders have continued to penalize GE for what they perceive as a risky finance business, one that nearly toppled the company during the peak of the global financial crisis. Since then, GE has scaled back its finance arm, selling off billions of dollars of assets from commercial real estate to international banks. But the stock remains stuck below $30 and the company has underperformed some of its industrial peers that don’t have big lending operations.
