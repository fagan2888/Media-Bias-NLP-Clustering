Those with specific genotypes markers put them at a higher risk for type 1 diabetes, and they advanced to the next round of testing and questionnaires.\n\nUltimately, about 7,500 children were tested for the study and Uusitalo said the testing will continue until the children are 15-years-old.\n\nProbiotic supplements were most commonly used in the first year of a child\u2019s life in Finland and Germany.\n\nDaylina Miller is a reporter with WUSF in Tampa.
