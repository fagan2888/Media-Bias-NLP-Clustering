Many expressed their frustration on Twitter under the tag # VoltaWakaWaka \u2014 a plea for the return of the widely loved song that Colombian artist Shakira performed for the 2010 tournament in South Africa.\n\nAlthough Brazilian Claudia Leitte is also featured in the newest theme, critics say they don\u2019t understand why Cuban-American rapper Pitbull and Bronx-born Puerto Rican singer Jennifer Lopez were chosen for the song when there are so many other great musicians in the land of Bossa Nova. They also complain that the song is mostly in English and Spanish, leaving only a few seconds at the end for Leitte to sing in her native Portuguese.\n\n\u201cWhat I don\u2019t like about the music is that it\u2019s a poor, dull, generic pop theme,\u201d said Gaia Passarelli, a Brazilian music journalist and a former VJ for MTV Brazil. \u201cIt\u2019s a shame considering Brazil\u2019s rich musical tradition, which is admired all over the world.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn the end, we lost a chance to do something rich, inspiring and cool. I\u2019m feeling \u2018saudades\u2019 for Shakira,\u201d she said, using a Portuguese word that roughly translates as painful longing.\n\nFIFA Secretary General Jerome Valcke emphasized Leitte\u2019s involvement when the song was released earlier this year. \u201cIn my many visits to this country, I\u2019ve heard a lot about the great Brazilian music tradition and it gives me great pleasure to see a Brazilian artist at the heart of this song,\u201d the head of international soccer said after the theme was presented at Rio de Janeiro\u2019s Maracana stadium.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Brazil World Cup song fails to strike right tone", "author": "Luis Andres Henao", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Brazil World Cup song fails to strike right tone", "title": "Brazil World Cup song fails to strike right tone", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/05/25/brazil_world_cup_song_fails_to_strike_right_tone/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/05/brazil-world-cup-song.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Brazil World Cup song fails to strike right tone", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/05/brazil-world-cup-song.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "title": "Brazil World Cup song fails to strike right tone", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Brazil World Cup song fails to strike right tone", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8d8b\"", "article_summary": "Topics: From the Wires, Entertainment News, NewsSANTIAGO, Chile (AP) \u2014 The official World Cup song definitely strikes a chord, but some think it\u2019s the wrong one.\nSince the recent release of FIFA\u2019s \u201cWe Are One (Ole Ola),\u201d hordes of fans in Brazil have been slamming the official 2014 Cup theme.\n\u201cWhat I don\u2019t like about the music is that it\u2019s a poor, dull, generic pop theme,\u201d said Gaia Passarelli, a Brazilian music journalist and a former VJ for MTV Brazil.\nFIFA Secretary General Jerome Valcke emphasized Leitte\u2019s involvement when the song was released earlier this year.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a shame considering Brazil\u2019s rich musical tradition, which is admired all over the world.\u201d\u201cIn the end, we lost a chance to do something rich, inspiring and cool."}
