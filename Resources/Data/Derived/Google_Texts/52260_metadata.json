That was until one of the passengers made a boneheaded remark that was neither right place nor right time. After a fit of coughing and sneezing, the passenger reportedly yelled, \u201cI have Ebola\u201d \u2014 yes, the same Ebola that has led to over 4,500 deaths in West Africa and recently took its first life in the United States.\n\nMoments after the flight landed at Punta Cana International Airport, passengers were treated to a scene straight out a horror movie as men in blue hazmat suits boarded the plane to deal with the passenger. The user who uploaded a video to YouTube said the passengers aboard the flight were held on the tarmac for two hours while the medical team secured the patient. He can be heard saying, \u201cI ain\u2019t from Africa,\u201d in the video.\n\nThe man, who was identified as an American, was taken to the airport's medical center to undergo further testing. It was confirmed that he did not show signs of a fever, which tends to be an early symptom of Ebola. However, the man was still flown back to the U.S. to undergo a second precautionary round of testing.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "i, have, ebola, hazmat", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "A U.S. Airways passenger on a flight from Philadelphia to Punta Cana, Dominican Republic, yelled \"I have Ebola,\" which forced a medical team in hazmat suits to keep passengers on the tarmac for two hours while the man was tested.", "title": "Please Don't Yell 'I Have Ebola!'
