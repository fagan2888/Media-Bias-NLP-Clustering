Ted Cruz, R-Texas, boosted his populist bonafides with his right-wing base Thursday.\n\nIn response to \"Big Business\" backlash toward controversial \u201creligious freedom\u201d legislation in Indiana and Arkansas, the Texas senator went after major corporations opposing the policy.\n\nHe brought up the issue to a few hundred supporters in Sioux City, Iowa. From Fortune Magazine:\n\n\u201cThe Fortune 500 is running shamelessly to endorse the radical gay marriage agenda over religious liberty to say: \u2018We will persecute a Christian pastor, a Catholic priest, a Jewish rabbi. Any person of faith is subject to persecution if they dare disagree, if their religious faith parts way from their political commitment to gay marriage.'\u201d\n\nCompanies like Wal-Mart, Apple, Microsoft, NASACAR and the NCAA have voiced disapproval of the \u201cReligious Freedom Restoration Act.\u201d\n\nCruz's attack won\u2019t endear him to Wall Street or even center-right Republicans, but that\u2019s what the lone wolf grassroots candidate wants. He raised $4 million in the first days of his White House bid with 95 percent of the money coming from donors giving $100 or less.\n\nThe junior senator knows what to say to keep his Tea Party fans energized. He\u2019s not afraid to make controversial remarks as long as it keeps his base excited. That\u2019s not something his likely establishment GOP challenger Jeb Bush can get away with. Unlike Cruz, Bush walked back his support of the Indiana law.\n\nCheck out the good, the bad and the weird from Ted Cruz\u2019s presidential campaign so far in the gallery above.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"SKYPE_TOOLBAR": "SKYPE_TOOLBAR_PARSER_COMPATIBLE", "vf": {"section": "news", "unique_id": "chron-article-6177623"}, "og": {"site_name": "Houston Chronicle", "description": "Sen.
