But training and attracting new nurses aren\u2019t the region\u2019s only concerns \u2013 it also has a problem retaining them. At 17.4 percent, the RN turnover rate for the region surpasses the state average by nearly two percentage points.\n\n\u201cDuring the recession, people were more apt to hunker down, hold on to the job they had and ride out the storm,\u201d said Kris Jones, corporate director of talent acquisition for CoxHealth. \u201cWhen the unemployment rate is low and jobs are abundant, people feel more confident about leaving and taking a chance on another job.\u201d\n\nWith roughly 200 nursing jobs currently open across the CoxHealth system, Jones said the MHA\u2019s prediction of 117 RNs needed in coming years sounds low.\n\n\u201cWe employ over 3,000 nurses right now, and that number is going to grow rapidly,\u201d she said. \u201cGrowth plus attrition means most nursing positions will be in high demand.\u201d\n\n\n\nWhy the shortage?\n\nAccording to the MHA\u2019s 2015 Workforce Report, many simultaneous factors are causing the rise in vacancy and turnover across the state. Jones cites baby boomers, the Affordable Care Act, medical advances and Missourians\u2019 poor health.\n\n\u201cThe baby boomers are a large generation who are starting to retire and that means a lot of nurses leaving the field,\u201d she said. \u201cIt also means a lot of aging people who now need more medical care than ever, and that just compounds the problem.\u201d\n\nAmong the RN workforce, 42 percent are age 50 or older, and it\u2019s estimated nearly half of nurses over the age of 50 plan on retiring in 10 years.\n\nMissouri\u2019s entire population is aging at a rapid pace, with 14.2 percent age 65 or older, according to the MHA. By 2030, seniors are expected to make up nearly a quarter of Missouri\u2019s population and chronic disease is driving up demand for services. About three-quarters of Missouri adults have at least one chronic disease, while more than half have at least two, according to the study. Combined, the issues place the Show-Me State in the bottom fourth of the nation\u2019s unhealthiest states, according to the United Health Foundation.\n\nCouple those factors with increased coverage under ACA, and the state is poised for a health care boom.\n\n\u201cMost of our nursing recruiting is focused on (licensed practical nurses) due to our extensive primary care clinic focus and a need for LPNs in those practice environments,\u201d said Bernadette Losh, chief clinic officer for Ozarks Community Hospital, which operates two hospitals and 18 clinics throughout the Ozarks. \u201cThe current LPN shortage we believe is attributed in large part to bridge programs offered at nursing schools, where LPNs bridge to their RN. Many nurses are advancing from LPN to RN instead of joining the workforce after graduation.\u201d\n\nAccording to the MHA study, LPNs have a towering 27.8 percent turnover rate across the region, nearly double the state average of 15.5 percent.\n\nCoxHealth\u2019s Jones has similar concerns, siting a shortage of nursing instructors as the reason for small class sizes and a lag in nurse production.\n\nCox College President Lance Ratcliff believes that\u2019s partly true.\n\n\u201cWe have no problems finding faculty. In fact, we have numerous applications for each position we open,\u201d he said of the CoxHealth-affiliated nursing school. \u201cThe bottleneck is on the clinical side, not in the classroom.\n\n\u201cA large part of a nurse\u2019s training is practical clinical applications. Students shadow full-time nurses on the job. But getting a full-time nurse, who\u2019s already intensely busy, is difficult.\u201d\n\n\n\nWhat can be done about it?\n\nRatcliff said the school is working with CoxHealth to address the clinician issue, making a concerted effort to work with the community to increase class sizes and expand recruitment. Ratcliff said the school graduated about 200 new nurses of varying degrees during the last academic year.\n\nThroughout the seven-county region, which includes five reporting hospitals, the study found unlicensed assistive personnel were the greatest need, with a 12.7 percent vacancy rate, followed by occupational therapists, speech therapists, RNs and LPNs.\n\nJones believes recruitment will be key to staying on top of the need as CoxHealth works not just at the college level, but also on what she calls passive candidates.\n\n\u201cWith the unemployment rate low, we need to capture the attention of people who aren\u2019t seeking jobs,\u201d she said. \u201cThese passive candidates already have jobs and aren\u2019t looking. But if they notice something on social media that looks more appealing, they will go for it.\u201d\n\nTo address its current need, OCH will host an LPN hiring fair later this month.\n\n\u201cWe welcome both recent college graduates as well as seasoned nurses currently employed elsewhere,\u201d she said. \u201cWe do find that we can train and mold new graduates to our culture. However, experience is a great benefit.\u201d\n\nRatcliff believes the solution isn\u2019t black and white.\n\n\u201cIf you ask five people why there is a shortage, you will get five different answers and five different solutions,\u201d he said. \u201cNursing faces some stiff competition.\n\n\u201cThis is a significant problem that can only be solved through cooperation on every level throughout the health care community.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://sbj.net/Images/Images/102792.jpg"}, "description": "Health care already is the No. 1 employer in southwest Missouri and the sector is poised for increased and rapid growth during the next decade. \nThe Missouri Ho"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fddefd\"", "article_summary": "CoxHealth\u2019s Jones has similar concerns, siting a shortage of nursing instructors as the reason for small class sizes and a lag in nurse production.\nBut getting a full-time nurse, who\u2019s already intensely busy, is difficult.\u201dWhat can be done about it?\nAt 17.4 percent, the RN turnover rate for the region surpasses the state average by nearly two percentage points.\n\u201cThis is a significant problem that can only be solved through cooperation on every level throughout the health care community.\u201d\n\u201cWith the unemployment rate low, we need to capture the attention of people who aren\u2019t seeking jobs,\u201d she said."}
