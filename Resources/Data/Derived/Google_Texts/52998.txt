LA VILLA, Italy — Marcel Hirscher became the first skier to win the challenging Alta Badia giant slalom in three consecutive years Sunday, reclaiming the overall World Cup lead from Aksel Lund Svindal.

Erasing a slim first-run disadvantage, Hirscher finished 0.19 of a second ahead of Henrik Kristoffersen of Norway on the steep, twisty Gran Risa Course.

“I skied totally my 100 percent,” Hirscher said. “I think Kristoffersen was a little bit smoother, but I pushed harder.”

Kristoffersen recently beat the Austrian star in a slalom in Val d’Isere, France, and believes he can do the same in GS.

“I’m getting closer to Marcel,” he said. “Soon, somebody has to beat him. So why not me?”

Opening-leg leader Victor Muffat-Jeandet of France ended up in third place, 0.86 behind.

American star Ted Ligety moved up from 10th place after the morning run and finished fourth, missing the podium by nearly half a second.

“It was a nice step in the right direction for me,” said Ligety, who missed a month of training because of back and hip injuries after the season opener.
