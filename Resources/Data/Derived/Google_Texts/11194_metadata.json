Mike Huckabee finished third with 14 percent and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio placed fifth with 13 percent.\n\nMr. Carson was the crowd\u2019s top pick for vice president. Carly Fiorina was the crowd\u2019s second choice for vice president, and Mr. Cruz was the third.\n\nMeanwhile, Donald J. Trump landed in fifth place with 5 percent, which is likely to fuel additional questions about whether the New York billionaire can translate his rock start status in national polls into support in the early caucus and primary states from Republican-leaning evangelical or born-again Christians, who say they still have questions about his faith and his stances on cultural issues.\n\n\u201cThe Values Voters Summit is not just a snapshot of social conservatives across the country. It is social conservative influencers,\u201d said Tony Perkins, head of the Family Research Council, which hsoted the event. \u201cThese are people who take time and resources to come here, who are engaged. They go back home and they are influencers.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo this is more reflective of what may be coming a few months down the road, as opposed to where the general social conservative community is today,\u201d he said.\n\nSpeaker after speaker here at the three-day conservative confab sounded the alarm on the deterioration of \u201cfamily values,\u201d the war on \u201creligious liberty\u201d and the rise of \u201capocalyptic Islam\u201d among leaders in Iran and the Islamic State.\n\nKentucky County Clerk Kim Davis, who spent five days in jail after defying a Supreme Court ruling by refusing to issue same-sex couples marriage licenses, received the Cost of Discipleship Award from FRC Action, the legislative arm of the FRC.\n\nAnd David Daleiden, the 26-year-old founder of the Center for Medical Progress, which produced undercover videos of Planned Parenthood selling fetal tissue that has renewed efforts to stop federal funding for the abortion provider, also received a hero\u2019s welcome.\n\nThe straw poll showed that the top issues for the 2,700 registered guests were protecting religious liberty, supporting pro-life efforts and defending traditional marriage.\n\nThe results of the straw poll was more evidence of how many conservatives want a presidential nominee to shakeup the status quo in Washington and avoid tapping a \u201cmoderate\u201d cut from the same cloth as the party\u2019s past two nominees - former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney and Arizona Sen. John McCain.\n\nThe conservatives gathered here hooted and hollered in celebration of the news Friday that that House Speaker John A. Boehner, Ohio Republican, was leaving Congress at the end of October.\n\nThe announcement set the table for another leadership fight that is likely to expose the divisions over the direction of the GOP and the tactics that should be used to advance a conservative agenda on Capitol Hill.\n\nDespite running in the middle of the pack in national polls, Mr. Cruz is thought to be well-positioned in the nomination fight - in part because he is a top choice of both tea partyers and religious conservatives, who love how he has picked fights with both parties on Capitol Hill over Obamacare, executive amnesties for illegal immigrants and the Iranian nuclear deal.\n\nHis campaign and allied super PACs have raised gobs of money and conservatives and tea partyers have celebrated the way he has questioned whether GOP leaders in Congress are truly committed to cutting the size and scope of government and pushing pack against the Obama administration\u2019s policies.\n\nStraw poll percent results:\n\nTed Cruz: 35 percent\n\nBen Carson: 18 percent\n\nMike Huckabee: 14 percent\n\nMarco Rubio: 13 percent\n\nDonald Trump: 5 percent\n\nRick Santorum: 4 percent\n\nCarly Fiorina: 3 percent\n\nBobby Jindal: 3 percent\n\nRand Paul: 2 percent\n\nWrite In Candidate: 1 percent\n\nJohn Kasich: 1 percent\n\nJeb Bush: 1 percent\n\nChris Christie: 0 percent\n\nLindsey Graham: 0 percent", "article_metadata": {"description": "GOP White House hopeful Ted Cruz ruled the roost once again at the annual Values Voter Summit by winning the annual presidential preference straw poll here for the third straight year - further cementing his status a favorite among social conservatives that will play a pivotal role in picking the party's nominee.", "Author": "Seth McLaughlin", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "GOP White House hopeful Ted Cruz ruled the roost once again at the annual Values Voter Summit by winning the annual presidential preference straw poll here for the third straight year - further cementing his status a favorite among social conservatives that will play a pivotal role in picking the party\u2019s nominee.", "title": "Ted Cruz wins Values Voter straw poll", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/sep/26/ted-cruz-wins-values-voter-straw-poll/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/09/26/4fda056a24ac072b830f6a706700299d.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/09/26/4fda056a24ac072b830f6a706700299d.jpg", "title": "Ted Cruz wins Values Voter straw poll", "description": "GOP White House hopeful Ted Cruz ruled the roost once again at the annual Values Voter Summit by winning the annual presidential preference straw poll here for the third straight year - further cement", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "news_keywords": "Politics"}, "article_summary": "The straw poll showed that the top issues for the 2,700 registered guests were protecting religious liberty, supporting pro-life efforts and defending traditional marriage.\nIt is social conservative influencers,\u201d said Tony Perkins, head of the Family Research Council, which hsoted the event.\n\u201cThe Values Voters Summit is not just a snapshot of social conservatives across the country.\nGOP White House hopeful Ted Cruz ruled the roost once again at the annual Values Voter Summit by winning the annual presidential preference straw poll here for the third straight year - further cementing his status a favorite among social conservatives that will play a pivotal role in picking the party\u2019s nominee.\nThe Texas Republican captured 35 percent of the votes cast, outpacing his closest rival Ben Carson, who received 18 percent."}
