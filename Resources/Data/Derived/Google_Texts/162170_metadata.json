While other shows center around round-table chats and celebrity interviews, Oliver uses his massive platform to highlight overlooked but important political issues. Recently, he told CBS that his focus was \u201cabsurd public policies.\u201d\n\nBy highlighting the absurdities of American institutions, he milks the injustice for a laugh while drawing the attention of millions of viewers to the issue. It\u2019s a brilliant combination that, when it fires on all cylinders, makes for great comedy and sometimes even triggers reforms.\n\nHere are his seven best segments.\n\n1. Net Neutrality\n\nArguably Oliver\u2019s breakout hit, this segment masterfully dissected the knotty issue of net neutrality and its effect on free speech. Oliver explained why creating a two-tiered Internet was unfair, and even recruited the Internet\u2019s \u201cvile commenters\u201d to spam the FCC\u2019s website, which was taking public comment at the time. As a result, the website crashed and FCC Chair Tom Wheeler had to hilariously insist to the public that he \u201cwasn\u2019t a dingo.\u201d\n\n2. Abusive Animal Agriculture Practices\n\nPossibly the least sexy topic his show has ever covered, Oliver took on huge poultry processing corporations that exploit small farmers and work to gut legislation that regulates the industry and protects animal welfare. In one of the more clear-cut political wins, the segment actually resulted in a pro-industry rider being left out of the Agriculture Appropriations Bill this summer for the first time in years. Several members of Congress cited Oliver\u2019s segment for providing the political will to remedy the problem.\n\n3. Bail System Exploits the Poor\n\nAmerica\u2019s bail system is a two-tiered system where those who can afford to pay their bail go free and those who can\u2019t are often forced to plead guilty or waste away in lockup before trial. Like many of the topics Oliver covers, it\u2019s an injustice that exists largely due to inertia, despite being widely condemned as being unfair. One month after Oliver\u2019s segment aired, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio announced the city was reforming its bail system to lessen the burden on low-level offenders, allowing a judge to release up to 3,000 defendants awaiting trial. While there were certainly other factors at play, many pundits insisted Oliver\u2019s segment helped bring the topic to the forefront of public debate.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The HBO host has accomplished what Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert never could.
