“Real Time” host Bill Maher last night welcomed “The Confidence Game” author Maria Konnikova to determine, once and for all, whether or not Donald Trump is, in fact, a con artist.

Konnikova told Maher that when she first saw Trump’s steak and wine Mar-a-Lago press conference, she thought, “I’m a psychic. Because I clearly predicted that this was going to happen.”

“He was blatantly lying,” Konnikova said about Trump’s phony steaks. “The hallmark of a con artist is someone who deceives you for their own ends.”

“He’s telling everyone exactly what they want to hear,” she continued. “And he doesn’t actually say anything … That’s what confidence artists do.”
