× Skid-resistant pavement will get tested in Kansas City

KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) _ Missouri transportation officials are testing an anti-skid surface treatment in Kansas City.

The Kansas City Star (http://bit.ly/1EWgSuK) reports that highway officials are trying to determine whether it reduces the number of crashes, especially the number of vehicles that run off the road. The Missouri Department of Transportation hopes to have the treatment installed this summer on the ramp from southbound Interstate 29 to southbound Interstate 635 in the northern part of the city.

Laurel McKean, a district traffic engineer with MoDOT, says the surface will “feel a little bit rougher.”

MoDOT had positive results when it tested the treatment on U.S. 54 in Jefferson City two years ago. The I-29 project is among nine throughout the state funded through a nearly $1 million federal grant.
