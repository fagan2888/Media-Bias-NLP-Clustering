Defenseman Barrie and forward Mac- Kinnon are pending restricted free agents after next season. The Avs can afford to wait to extend Barrie and MacKinnon, but extending Johnson before next summer will be a priority. Johnson undoubtedly will get a hefty raise from his $3.75 million cap hit.\n\nThe Avs are about $16.7 million under the NHL\u2019s $71.4 million salary cap, although a handful of current restricted free agents including newly acquired center Mikhail Grigorenko, forward Joey Hishon and goalie Calvin Pickard will be given qualifying offers by 3 p.m. Monday.\n\nDepending on how many RFA qualifying offers are given, Colorado will be $13 million to $15 million under the cap by Wednesday.\n\n\u201cWe have room, but we also have to make sure we\u2019re responsible because we do have some guys coming up next year,\u201d Avs general manager Joe Sakic said Friday. \u201cObviously, we\u2019d like to get one more defenseman and we\u2019ll see how that goes. We want to be responsible, and hopefully there\u2019s a fit for us July 1. If it doesn\u2019t work out \u2014 we don\u2019t have the guy we want, or the guy or two \u2014 we know we\u2019ve got flexibility to do something via trade whether it\u2019s in the summer or September.\u201d\n\nAndrej Sekera is on the open market\n\nLos Angeles\u2019 Andrej Sekera, 29, is regarded as the top left-shooting defenseman under age 30, and he is not expected to re-sign with the Kings by Monday. The Avs prefer a left-shooting D-man to accompany righties Johnson and Barrie on the first two pairings.\n\nOther top-four capable lefties expected to be on the market are Pittsburgh\u2019s Christian Ehrhoff, 32, and Chicago\u2019s Johnny Oduya, 33. The sleeper: San Jose\u2019s Matt Irwin, 27, who went undrafted but now is an excellent two-way player.\n\nThe top right-shooting D-men are Washington\u2019s Mike Green, 29, and Nashville\u2019s Cody Franson, 27.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Avalanche is preparing for NHL free agency 2015", "title": "Avalanche is preparing for NHL free agency 2015", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/06/28/avalanche-is-preparing-for-nhl-free-agency-2015/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150618_124210_sakic-roy.jpg", "height": 446}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150618_124210_sakic-roy.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-06-28T21:00:20+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-22T19:30:03+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce046\"", "article_summary": "Defenseman Barrie and forward Mac- Kinnon are pending restricted free agents after next season.\nJohnson, the Avs\u2019 top defenseman, could be an unrestricted free agent next summer.\nJohnson undoubtedly will get a hefty raise from his $3.75 million cap hit.\nOn the heels of the NHL draft and the six-player trade involving Ryan O\u2019Reilly and the Buffalo Sabres, the Avalanche is preparing for the free-agent frenzy Wednesday.\nThe Avs can afford to wait to extend Barrie and MacKinnon, but extending Johnson before next summer will be a priority."}
