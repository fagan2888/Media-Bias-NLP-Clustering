Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson didn’t do anything wrong when he shot and killed Michael Brown but could have had better training in “other techniques” to handle the fateful August encounter, potential 2016 Republican presidential candidate Ben Carson said Tuesday.

Retired neurosurgeon and West Palm Beach resident Carson, who is black, also told syndicated conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt that race relations in America have worsened under President Barack Obama.

“I actually believe that things were better before this president was elected. And I think that things have gotten worse because of his unusual emphasis on race,” Carson said.

Carson also faulted Obama for “the way he and a bunch of progressives manipulate, particularly minority communities, to make them feel that they are victims. And of course if you think you’re a victim, you are a victim.”
