(Photo by Claire Simms)\n\nGeorgians will be paying about $101 million more in Medicaid costs next year. According to the state Department of Community Health (DCH), the additional expenses are due to changes to the program under the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cThe financing of ACA even for a non-expansion state is a significant thing for us to be aware of,\u201d Jerry Dubberly of the DCH explained Wednesday to members of a state Senate committee looking at Medicaid funding alternatives.\n\nDubberly said those changes include the federal government charging premium taxes, transferring some children from Peachcare to Medicaid, increasing primary care physician payment rates and extending eligibility review timelines from every six months to every 12.\n\nThe department also projects there will be a significant increase in people enrolling in Medicaid because of what Dubberly called \u201cthe woodwork effect.\u201d People who have been eligible for Medicaid, but who have never enrolled are expected to come out of the woodwork because of all the recent outreach efforts encouraging people to get health coverage. The state project an additional 65,000 people will enroll in Medicaid coverage by Fiscal Year 2015.\n\nAbout 19 percent of the state\u2019s population is currently enrolled in Medicaid. Dubberly estimated that will increase to more than 21 percent in 2020.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve kept the trend and growth rate in Georgia below the national average. We worked to manage the program appropriately, but we still have to make sure that we do something very different then we\u2019re doing today because this type growth is not sustainable,\u201d said Dubberly.\n\nThat is why some state legislators have been trying to get ahead of the problem by getting input from stakeholders.\n\n\u201cThe main thing that we\u2019re doing as lawmakers is balancing the budget and understanding what numbers we have to fit into slots and unfortunately, when you have to generate new money for a new program such as the Affordable Care Act, the money has to come from someplace else,\u201d said state Senator Renee Untermann, R-Buford. \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult decisions to have to make, but they\u2019re decisions that are imminent in January.\u201d\n\nThe state will face yet another tough decision in January 2015.\n\nUnder the ACA, the federal government increased Medicaid reimbursements to primary care physicians to 100 percent.\n\n\u201cOur doctors are very happy about the enhanced rate for primary care,\u201d said David Tatum of Children\u2019s Healthcare of Atlanta.\n\nThat happiness, however, may be short-lived. The federal government will not fund that reimbursement rate after December 31, 2014.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re going to give them a rate increase and at the end of 14 months from now, take that away, you\u2019re going to have a lot of physicians that say, \u2018Look, I\u2019m just not going to take Medicaid anymore.\u2019 And if that happens and those Medicaid beneficiaries lose their medical home, they will turn to another provider for care. That\u2019ll be the hospital emergency room.\u201d\n\nTatum said ER care costs considerably more than regular doctor visits. But the state will be in a difficult position because DCH estimates it would cost Georgians $70 million per year to maintain the 100 percent Medicaid reimbursement rate for primary care physicians.", "article_metadata": {"meta_title": "Medicaid Changes To Cost Georgia $101 Million", "medium": "News", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"site_name": "Georgia Public Broadcasting", "description": "Georgians will be paying about $101 million more in Medicaid costs next year.
