They don't have company. Most of them don't have anybody at all that comes to see them.\"\n\nIt's a small gesture that means the world to those who otherwise would spend the holidays alone.\n\n\"We've still got to take care of our seniors, you know, and don't forget them,\" Nutrition Coordinator for Council on Aging, Janice Jerginson, said.\n\n\"It means a lot when you're home bound, practically home bound,\" Dyer said.\n\n\"It's beautiful and wonderful,\" she added.\n\nIt's not just the people receiving the meals who share in the joy. For many volunteers, it's a yearly tradition to help them feel the meaning of Christmas\n\n\"I love it,\" Jerginson said. \"I've been doing it for 24 years now, so if I didn't love this job, I wouldn't be here.\"\n\nThe Knights of Columbus prepared more than 120 meals that the local volunteers handed out.", "article_metadata": {"description": "To make sure no senior is forgotten this Christmas Eve, volunteers gave up time with their families to make the season special for them.", "language": "english", "author": "Danielle Ellis", "og": {"url": "http://www.wjhg.com/home/headlines/Volunteers-with-Meals-on-Wheels-treat-seniors-for-the-holidays-363491581.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/MEALS+ON+WHEELS21.JPG", "type": "article", "description": "To make sure no senior is forgotten this Christmas Eve, volunteers gave up time with their families to make the season special for them.", "title": "Volunteers with Meals on Wheels treat seniors to holiday meal"}, "twitter": {"description": "To make sure no senior is forgotten this Christmas Eve, volunteers gave up time with their families to make the season special for them.", "creator": "@WJHG_TV", "url": "http://www.wjhg.com/home/headlines/Volunteers-with-Meals-on-Wheels-treat-seniors-for-the-holidays-363491581.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/MEALS+ON+WHEELS21.JPG", "title": "Volunteers with Meals on Wheels treat seniors to holiday meal", "site": "@WJHG_TV", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "keywords": "Volunteers with Meals on Wheels treat seniors to holiday meal", "google-site-verification": "orfdzs_E4bRXom1qluA34zerrmjsg4QfrlLSkrR3ZAQ", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Volunteers with Meals on Wheels, treat seniors to holiday meal"}, "article_summary": "Meals on Wheels hands out freshly prepared food to seniors in our area who have no one else to lean on.\n\"Meals on Wheels means a lot, not only to me, but to a lot of other people who otherwise might not have a meal, and I do enjoy them, especially the cookies,\" Allie Mae Dyer, who received a meal, said.\nThe Knights of Columbus prepared more than 120 meals that the local volunteers handed out.\nWith a feast of ham, mashed potatoes, veggies, and a dessert, people like Dyer can have their own holiday celebration.\nTo make sure no senior is forgotten this Christmas Eve, volunteers gave up time with their families to make the season special for them."}
