Private pay patients, those without any insurance, are billed on a sliding scale.\n\n\u201cWe use a sliding scale based on income as well as taking Medicare, Medicaid and private insurance,\u201d Allen said. \u201cAnd we are the only federally funded primary health care provider in north Georgia.\u201d\n\nOriginally operating from a single office in Trenton, in 2008 a Rossville office opened in space formerly occupied by the Walker County health department.\n\nWalker County sole commissioner Bebe Heiskell made the Rossville space available for a full-service clinic and about a year ago leased a county-owned building at the corner of Villanow and Duke streets available to PHC for use as administrative offices.\n\nAllen said the Trenton and Rossville locations had run out of office space and it had become apparent that the administrative offices not only needed more room but could operate more efficiently if located in one location rather than scattered across several counties.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve grown clinical services and needed the space for medical only use,\u201d Allen said. \u201cIt had reached a point where we knew we had to relocate.\u201d\n\nDuring the 2013 calendar year at least 10,500 patients made more than 30,000 visits to the various PHC offices. That number should increase as more medical staff are hired and more clinical space opens.\n\nWhat started in a single small space in Trenton now has a total staff of about 70 who are active in four clinics where there is always a need for more space. That made it more critically important to consolidate administrative and support services into a central location.\n\nAllen said it was fortunate that the timing was right for the county to lease the two-story building to PHC when the county\u2019s drug task force vacated the building a block from the square and from the county courthouse in LaFayette about a year ago.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a wonderful partnership,\u201d Allen said. \u201cIt is ideal for us because it is a convenient location to service all four sites we now operate.\u201d\n\nRecent additions to the PHC network include opening a clinic inside Tiger Creek Elementary School in Catoosa County in May 2013, and a standalone clinic in Cedartown this past January.\n\n\u201cWe serve adults and children,\u201d Allen said of the Tiger Creek clinic. \u201cAll Catoosa County students and their family members as well as the school\u2019s staff and teachers can come to the clinic.\u201d\n\nIn addition to medical services, a mobile dental clinic will regularly schedule visits to Tiger Creek before the end of this year.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re looking forward to having dental services available to people even if they don\u2019t use our medical,\u201d Allen said. \u201cThe question is always \u2018how to serve\u2019 \u2014 that really is our mission.\u201d\n\nToward that goal, PHC has joined a coalition that includes churches, social service agencies, United Way and the city of LaFayette to provide medical screenings and education in what is being called the West LaFayette Project.\n\n\u201cIt is a monthly outreach program,\u201d Allen said.\n\nIt is too early to tell whether the Affordable Care Act will help or hurt PHC, but officials have not seen a significant increase in the number of uninsured coming through the clinic\u2019s doors\n\n\u201cGeorgia\u2019s not expanding Medicaid has left PHC with a big case load of the uninsured,\u201d Allen said. \u201cOn average, about 50 percent of those we see are uninsured or are provided services that are billed on a sliding scale.\u201d\n\nAnd like the family doctors of years gone by, PHC staff serve as comprehensive providers. For mental health services, PHC partners with Lookout Mountain Community Services. Its dental clinic provides services as well as referrals. Its trained staff help with medication management and maintenance for long-term conditions such as diabetes and hypertension.\n\nIn sum, PHC serves as a one-stop-shop for nearly all basic medical needs.\n\n\u201cThere is a strong correlation between physical, mental and dental health,\u201d Allen said. \u201cSome see it as a holistic approach, we call it comprehensive services.\u201d\n\nAbout Primary Healthcare Centers\n\nPrimary Health Care Centers (PHC) is a not-for profit, 501 (c)-3, board-directed, Federally Qualified Healthcare Center (FQHC) founded in 1978.
