Gov. Nikki Haley.\n\nKeck is the guy who \u2013 at Haley\u2019s direction (and with funding support from the S.C. General Assembly) \u2013 orchestrated a massive expansion of Medicaid in the Palmetto State this year.\n\nHow massive? According to Keck\u2019s own numbers, enrollment in this government program is set to soar by 16 percent in the current fiscal year \u2013 triple the projected rate of growth from the previous year. That astronomical figure \u2013 which will cost South Carolina taxpayers half a billion dollars \u2013 is more than three times higher than the average growth rate in states that didn\u2019t accept Obamacare\u2019s Medicaid expansion. In fact it\u2019s higher than the average 12 percent growth rate of the states that did accept Obamacare subsidies.\n\nAmazing \u2026 especially in light of Haley\u2019s claim that her administration would \u201cnot expand Medicaid. Ever.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s also amazing government-subsidized health care would be expanding by leaps and bounds in the midst of a so-called \u201crecovery\u201d in South Carolina.\n\nGuess Haley\u2019s economic record isn\u2019t everything it\u2019s cracked up to be \u2026\n\nAnyway \u2026\n\nAccording to our sources, Keck \u2013 who was tapped in 2011 to lead the S.C. Department of Health and Human Services (SCDHHS) \u2013 will leave Haley\u2019s cabinet within the next few weeks and take a job with the Nashville, Tennessee-based Hospital Corporation of America (HCA).\n\nOther sources conflict that account, saying Keck is leaving to take a job with Nashville, Tennessee-based Mountain States Health Alliance.\n\nHow convenient, right? He balloons the state\u2019s Medicaid rolls \u2026 then takes a job with a company that\u2019s poised to cash in on all of those subsidies.\n\nHCA \u2013 founded by the father of former \u201cRepublican\u201d U.S. Senate leader Bill Frist \u2013 is the largest for-profit operator of hospitals in the world, with nearly 300 facilities under its direction. Mountain States Health Alliance recently named Keck\u2019s mentor Alan Lavine as its new CEO.\n\nSources say Keck is reporting taking a \u201cregional leadership\u201d job.\n\nWhatever he\u2019s doing \u2026 for either company \u2026 the arrangement stinks.\n\nWe need to be able to trust that bureaucrats appointed to positions like this are acting in the best interests of citizens and taxpayers \u2013 not their own professional future.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.fitsnews.com/2014/10/06/tony-kecks-pay-day/", "site_name": "http://www.fitsnews.com", "image": "http://fitsnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/keck.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "Tony Keck\u2019s Pay Day \u2026"}, "google-site-verification": "qt01SY7jA5pURQJ_8ITASviDysHU8yHfJWpIIdAPKQU", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1,user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd41c7\"", "article_summary": "Mountain States Health Alliance recently named Keck\u2019s mentor Alan Lavine as its new CEO.\nIn fact it\u2019s higher than the average 12 percent growth rate of the states that did accept Obamacare subsidies.\nOther sources conflict that account, saying Keck is leaving to take a job with Nashville, Tennessee-based Mountain States Health Alliance.\nHe balloons the state\u2019s Medicaid rolls \u2026 then takes a job with a company that\u2019s poised to cash in on all of those subsidies.\n\u2026 AT YOUR EXPENSEBy FITSNEWS || Over the weekend, this website exclusively reported on the looming departure of Tony Keck from the cabinet of S.C.
