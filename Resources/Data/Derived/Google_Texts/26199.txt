The pro-democracy Umbrella Movement in Hong Kong that calls for the universal suffrage right has sounded alarm bells in Taiwan, a flourishing democracy and an attractive investment destination for numerous emerging market investors.

Taiwan, which takes up a significant portion of emerging markets indices, and China have shared a tense and uneasy relationship over the past 65 years. China has never recognized Taiwan as an independent nation and Taiwan has always refused China’s proposal that it be governed by the Mainland as part of the “one country, two systems” regime that exists for Hong Kong.
