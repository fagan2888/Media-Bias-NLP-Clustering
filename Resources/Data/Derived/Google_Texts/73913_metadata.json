Marco Rubio is making a final push Friday in Burlington, Muscatine, Clinton and Dubuque.\n\nA forward-thinking Rubio promises to unite Republicans and the conservative movement in the general election.\n\nAs Iowa's campaign comes down to the wire, he says he's ready to take on and defeat Hillary Clinton.\n\n\"She does not want to run against me, but I can't wait to run against her,\" he said.\n\nThat message resonates with a crowd of 200 in Muscatine.\n\nRight now, Rubio is running a solid third place, trailing front runners Donald Trump and Sen. Ted Cruz.\n\n\"He's young. He can do it,\" said Rubio supporter Sharon Weggen. \"I have no doubt he can be the best president we ever had.\"\n\n\"He has a great story,\" added Jeanita McNulty, Blue Grass. \"He really has humble beginnings, and people can admire that.\"\n\nRubio is revisiting pledges to repeal Obamacare, get tough on immigration and rebuild the military.\n\nHe's also reaching out to Evangelicals by calling for faith-based decisions in government.\n\n\"It's a reminder of what's at stake here,\" he said. \"Iowa will be the first people in the country who will get a chance to answer the question: What comes after Barack Obama?\"\n\nWhile reinforcing his campaign themes, there's more urgency these days.\n\nEach stop becomes a push to get out the vote on Monday night across Iowa.\n\n\"He sounds like he's very team-orientated,\" said Rubio supporter Gary Rowzheimer. \"Everything needs to be a unified decision. It's not 'my' decision. It's 'our' decision,\"\n\nRubio is calling on his likability and legislative priorities to make a big finish.\n\n\"We feel real good about it,\" he concluded. \"We can't wait until Monday night.\"", "article_metadata": {"geo.position": "41.424473;-91.043205", "description": "It's crunch time for presidential candidates in Iowa.
