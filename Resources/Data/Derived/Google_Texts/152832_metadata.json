For adults with autism, medical costs range between $13,580 and $27,159 annually, according to the study.\n\nBy comparison, special education for children with autism costs one-and-a-half to nearly five times as much as their medical care. Costs for special education run between $13,980 and $62,920 a year, again depending on age and intellectual disability, the study found.\n\nParents' lost wages cost an average $18,720 annually for the care of a child with autism, outpacing medical expenses. \"Mothers drop out of the workforce to care for their children with autism, and those wages are substantial,\" Mandell said.\n\nResidential care is the largest average expense for adults with autism, costing between $18,080 and $36,161 annually -- more than twice the amount spent on medical care. Lost wages for adults with autism cost about $10,718 a year, the study authors said.\n\nThe numbers for both children and adults suggest that \"there's a very high expense of not properly caring for children with autism,\" Mandell said.\n\n\"If we were able to provide better and more appropriate care for these children, mothers wouldn't be dropping out of the workforce,\" he said. \"We also really need very different workplace policies that support the parents of children with disabilities.\"\n\nThe adult costs of autism could reflect a failure to properly prepare children with autism for their entry into the wider world, Mandell said. With better education and training, these children might be able to live outside residential facilities and hold steady jobs.\n\n\"That's the $2.4 million question, isn't it? If we provided better early intervention, would we then see a different trajectory that would result in reduced costs for adults with autism?\" Mandell said. \"Our study doesn't answer that, but it needs to be answered.\"\n\nRosanoff noted that as astronomical as these figures are, the true cost is likely greater. Researchers prepared the study based on the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's estimate of autism prevalence, which was 1 in 88 people.\n\nBut two months ago the CDC revised its estimate, and now figures that 1 in 68 people have autism, he said.\n\n\"The numbers in this report are an underestimate of the true cost of autism in society, at least in the U.S.,\" Rosanoff said.\n\nAccording to the U.S. National Institutes of Health, autism -- or autism spectrum disorders -- represent a range of developmental disorders characterized by impaired social interactions, problems with verbal and nonverbal communication, and repetitive behaviors or severely limited activities and interests.\n\nThe study findings were published online June 9 in the journal JAMA Pediatrics.\n\nMore information\n\nFor more on autism, visit the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "https://consumer.healthday.com/cognitive-health-information-26/autism-news-51/autism-s-costs-can-run-into-millions-for-one-person-688667.html", "image": "https://media.healthday.com/Images/editorial/autism06172.jpg", "site_name": "Consumer HealthDay", "description": "Lost wages, residential care and special education are just some of the driving factors, study finds", "title": "Autism's Costs Can Run Into Millions for One Person"}, "description": "Lost wages, residential care and special education are just some of the driving factors, study finds", "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=2.0,user-scalable=1"}, "article_summary": "By comparison, special education for children with autism costs one-and-a-half to nearly five times as much as their medical care.\nCosts for special education run between $13,980 and $62,920 a year, again depending on age and intellectual disability, the study found.\nFor adults with autism, medical costs range between $13,580 and $27,159 annually, according to the study.\nThe numbers for both children and adults suggest that \"there's a very high expense of not properly caring for children with autism,\" Mandell said.\nIf we provided better early intervention, would we then see a different trajectory that would result in reduced costs for adults with autism?\""}
