Senate Democrats are saying enough is enough by forcing Republicans to vote on a series of amendments that would replace Obamacare repeal with common sense gun laws.

The Hill reported:

A group, led by the chamber’s No. 2 Democrat Sen. Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.), announced Thursday that they would be forcing votes on measures such as universal background checks, just one day after 14 people died in a massacre in Southern California.

“Enough is enough. Senate Democrats are not waiting one more day. Today’s the day we act,” Schumer said at a briefing, flanked by a half-dozen other vocal gun control advocates.

“The entire country will know where every member of the Senate stands on tightening background checks, on keeping guns out of the hands of terrorists and on strengthening and improving mental health in this country,” he continued.

….

Schumer said the Democrats’ amendments would aim to replace the ObamaCare provisions and “turn it into meaningful legislation that the president would actually sign.”

Mitch McConnell empty Obamacare repeal show vote may end up backfiring on Republicans who are going to be forced to vote against many common sense gun laws that a majority of Americans support. Senate Republicans will get their completely worthless Obamacare repeal bill, but it is going to cost them dearly.

The campaign ads almost write themselves in blue states where Republican senators are hanging on for dear life.

It is not an understatement to suggest that Mitch McConnell’s decision to push an Obamacare repeal bill may end up costing Republicans their Senate majority. Republicans are going to be forced to vote for terrorists being able to legally buy guns in the United States.

The Obamacare repeal bill may end up being a disaster for Senate Republicans. Obamacare will still be the law of the land, and Republicans will be on the record as supporting legal loopholes that empower mass murderers.
