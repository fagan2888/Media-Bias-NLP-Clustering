Cigna’s revenue from U.S. insurance plans in 2015 hit $30.4 billion, or 4.1 percent overall market share, according to IBISWorld.Cigna revealed the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) had suspended it from enrolling new customers or marketing plans for Cigna Medicare Advantage and standalone prescription drug plan contracts.CMS charged Cigna with denying health care coverage and prescription drugs to patients who should have received them and of ‘widespread and systemic failures’. CMS also accused Cigna of maintaining shoddy documentation and neglecting to implement a risk assessment program, among other alleged violations.Cigna is required to appoint an independent monitor to audit its handling of the matter. Last year Cigna had 502,000 patients enrolled in Medicare Advantage plans, or three percent of the market, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation.Wyoming is under investigation by regulators for potentially allowing coal mining companies to waive clean-up insurance, putting state taxpayers on the hook for up to $900 million in costs.A federal review by the Interior Department’s Office of Surface Mining and Reclamation Enforcement is looking at two now-bankrupt Wyoming mining companies, Arch Coal and Alpha Natural Resources, to see if they have the means to cover several hundred million dollars’ worth of future clean-up costs.The investigation hinges on self-bonding, permitted under a decades-old mining program, whereby some of America’s biggest coal firms could forego insurance on a portion of future mine clean-up costs.Officials estimate that roughly $3.6 billion in self-bond liabilities could fall to taxpayers and "it is a big issue," Secretary of the Interior Sally Jewell told Congress in December.If federal officials find the companies have neglected their responsibilities, the regulators could assume oversight of the industry in Wyoming. Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality said it would respond within 10 business days, as required.Less than 24 hours after Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz publically lambasted Obamacare for leaving his family bereft of health insurance, it seems the opposite was true.Cruz last week bemoaned to college students in New Hampshire that he had no health insurance due to “the suffering that Obamacare has caused”.In fact, Blue Cross Blue Shield of Texas had automatically moved him and his family onto a new policy, though it seems his broker had not told the senator the news. The Humana policy is, however, 50 percent higher than the Cruz family’s previous health insurance.American International Group Inc is set to off-load a chunk of its mortgage guarantee company, according to a person close to discussions.
