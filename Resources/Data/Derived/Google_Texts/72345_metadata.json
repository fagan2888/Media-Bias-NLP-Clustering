They also ask his regulators for valuable subsidies, targeted tax breaks and favorable regulations, such as access to cheap foreign labor.\n\nSince 2009, Obama has increased government\u2019s power in many sectors of the economy, including the health-care, auto, education, energy, banking and real-estate sectors. He\u2019s now pushing for an increased role in managing the supply of workers, via passage of an immigration rewrite.\n\nObama is not a socialist, because he does not believe the government needs to own companies and factories. Instead, he\u2019s a progressive who believes the nation\u2019s economy and society should be managed by government experts, not by the varied preferences of individual CEOs, parents and workers.\n\nThe president\u2019s call for a partnership came after he spent two days early this week slamming the private sector.\n\n\u201cOur businesses are creating new jobs and have broken record profits, [and] the top 1 percent of Americans took home 20 percent of the nation\u2019s income last year, while the average worker isn\u2019t seeing a raise at all,\u201d he said Sept. 16, on the fifth anniversary of the 2008 Wall Street crash. (RELATED: Obama was a pioneering contributor to the national subprime real estate bubble)\n\n\n\n\u201cIn fact, that understates the problem \u2014 most of the gains have gone to the top one-tenth of 1 percent,\u201d Obama added.\n\n\u201cCapital, companies, they can move businesses and jobs anywhere they want. And so they\u2019re looking for the lowest wages,\u201d Obama said in a Sept. 15 NBC interview.\n\n\u201cThat squeezes workers here in the United States, even if corporations are profitable,\u201d he said, before arguing that companies\u2018 use of technology destroys jobs.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve eliminated entire occupations because they\u2019re now robotized. We don\u2019t have travel agents. We don\u2019t have bank tellers,\u201d he added.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Neil Munro", "description": "'It is going to be important for all of you... to understand what's at stake'", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "President Barack Obama told business leaders today that he wants close cooperation between his government and their companies.    \u201cWe want to be a consistent partner with you on a whole range of iss", "title": "Obama says he wants to \u2018partner\u2019 with American business", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2013/09/18/obama-says-he-wants-to-partner-with-american-business/", "image": {"width": 630, "identifier": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/77d5a165b42942ca807e8928e2636051-e1378479382686.jpg", "height": 270}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "'It is going to be important for all of you... to understand what's at stake'", "title": "Obama says he wants to \u2018partner\u2019 with American business Via @dailycaller", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2013/09/18/obama-says-he-wants-to-partner-with-american-business/", "image": {"src": "http://dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/77d5a165b42942ca807e8928e2636051-e1378479382686.jpg"}, "site": {"identifier": "@dailycaller", "id": 39308549}, "card": "summary"}, "sailthru.date": "2013-09-18 14:13:01", "sailthru.title": "Obama says he wants to 'partner' with American business", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "keywords": "barack obama,business roundtable", "fb": {"app_id": 143489452702, "pages": 182919686769}, "sailthru.tags": "barack-obama,neil-munro", "sailthru.description": "President Barack Obama told business leaders today that he wants close cooperation between his government and their companies.    \u201cWe want to be a consistent partner with you on a whole range of iss", "sailthru.image.full": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/77d5a165b42942ca807e8928e2636051-e1378479382686.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdefdf\"", "article_summary": "3860337President Barack Obama told business leaders today that he wants close cooperation between his government and their companies.\nSince 2009, Obama has increased government\u2019s power in many sectors of the economy, including the health-care, auto, education, energy, banking and real-estate sectors.\nAnd so they\u2019re looking for the lowest wages,\u201d Obama said in a Sept. 15 NBC interview.\nObama is not a socialist, because he does not believe the government needs to own companies and factories.\nHe\u2019s now pushing for an increased role in managing the supply of workers, via passage of an immigration rewrite."}
