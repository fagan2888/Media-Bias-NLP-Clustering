SOUTH BEND â€” Police arrested a man over the weekend for allegedly exposing himself to two children Wednesday after he tried to lure them into a garage in the city's River Park neighborhood.

Shawn A. Pfeil, 41, is charged with a single count of public indecency, a Class A misdemeanor, according to St. Joseph County court records. He was arrested late Friday on a preliminary charge of child exploitation, city police said.

A 7-year-old boy and 6-year-old boy said they were playing in a backyard in the 1000 block of South Ironwood Drive about 4:30 p.m. Wednesday when the man approached them from a nearby alley.

When the boys refused to go with the man, he allegedly showed them his genitals. The boys ran inside, and the man ran away from the scene.

A search of Pfeil's name did not yield any results on St. Joseph County's online registry of known sex offenders Monday morning.
