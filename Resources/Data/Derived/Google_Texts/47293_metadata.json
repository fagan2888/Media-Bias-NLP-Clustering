At its annual meeting in July, the Commission adopted a number of mostly minor changes to the UFTA, one of the most significant being a name change from the Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act to the Uniform Voidable Transactions Act. I applaud the change and hope that it reduces at least some of the confusion in this area.\n\nThe major reason for the change is the concept of \u201cconstructive fraud\u201d \u2013 a doctrine that permits avoidance of transactions where an insolvent debtor receives less than a reasonably equivalent value in exchange for what it gives up. The problem is that it isn\u2019t \u201cfraud\u201d and requires no proof of an improper intent, much less a fraudulent one. Nonetheless, the name \u201cconstructive fraud\u201d and its inclusion in a law on \u201cfraudulent\u201d transfers created a lot of confusion. Transactions involving parties with innocent motives are avoidable under the doctrine, but the name has misled a number of courts into issuing opinions that improperly limited its scope.\n\nThe revised law doesn\u2019t stop there, however. It takes the more aggressive view that even \u201cactual fraud\u201d doesn\u2019t require fraud. The drafters went to great lengths to remove the \u201cF\u201d word (the non-vulgar one) from almost every place it appeared in the Act and its comments. The comments emphasize that the ancient terminology \u201chinder, delay, or defraud\u201d creditors and includes actions intended to hinder or delay creditors even if lacking in any fraudulent intent. In place of a concept of fraudulently hindering or delaying, the comments substitute the idea of \u201cunacceptably contraven[ing] norms of creditors\u2019 rights\u201d as the measure for when efforts to hinder or delay render a transaction voidable. The references to \u201cdefraud\u201d are about the only vestiges of fraud left in the Act.\n\nIn addition to refocusing the courts\u2019 attention on the relevant factors that render transactions voidable, changing the terminology reverses those cases that applied the heighted \u201cfraud\u201d pleading and proof standards to actions brought under the UFTA and the earlier Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act (UFCA).\n\nThe UFTA is currently in force in 43 states, but not yet in New York. It remains to be seen whether the new UVTA will be as popular.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A name matters a lot apparently, or at least that is the view behind the recent revision of the Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act (UFTA) by the Uniform Law Commission.
