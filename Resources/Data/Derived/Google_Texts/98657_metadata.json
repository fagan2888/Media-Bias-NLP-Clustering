Otherwise their coverage will end Sept. 30.\n\nOf the 8 million people who signed up for private coverage through President Barack Obama\u2019s law, more than 2 million at one point had discrepancies of some sort that affected their eligibility. That number has been greatly reduced \u2014 but the remaining cases are proving difficult to resolve.\n\nPeople living in the country illegally are not allowed to get coverage.\n\nIn the letters being sent out consumers with unresolved citizenship and immigration issues are being advised that they can upload their documents to the HealthCare.gov website, or mail them in.\n\nMost haven\u2019t responded to repeated outreach efforts, officials said. Hispanics, who historically have lagged in health insurance coverage, may account for a big share of the group.\n\nIndeed, two states with large Latino populations top the list of unresolved cases. Florida has 93,800 cases, while Texas has 52,700. Georgia, Virginia and Pennsylvania round out the top five. The letters are being sent in English and Spanish.\n\nThe next five states are North Carolina, Illinois, Michigan, New Jersey and Louisiana.\n\nThe new policy affects the 36 states where the federal government has taken the lead in running online insurance markets created by the law. It\u2019s unclear how it will apply in places like California and New York, which are running their own insurance exchanges.\n\nSome supporters of the law worried that eligible consumers might lose coverage due to record-keeping problems on the government\u2019s part, or because of something as mundane as letters getting lost in the mail.\n\n\u201cMany of these people have issues because government files are incomplete,\u201d said Ron Pollack, executive director of the advocacy group Families USA. \u201cMany may feel that they have fully complied with what is necessary to get health coverage.\u201d\n\nThe number of problem cases was a lot larger only a few months ago, prompting criticism from congressional Republicans that the administration was signing up people ineligible under the law.\n\nIn May, there were nearly 970,000 people with citizenship or immigration problems. About half those cases have now been closed, officials said, and another 20 percent are being worked on actively. Officials have previously said that the overwhelming majority of cases are resolved in favor of the enrollee.\n\nConsumers who have unresolved discrepancies over their incomes will get notices at a later date.\n\nThe new health law provides subsidized coverage to people with no access to health insurance on the job. More than 80 percent of those signed up are getting subsidies to help with their premiums and, in some cases, their copays and deductibles as well.\n\nBut those taxpayer subsidies are contingent on meeting a host of requirements. The amount of a consumer\u2019s premium tax credit can vary by income, family size, hometown and other factors. That can make getting covered through the law feel somewhat like doing your taxes.\n\nThe letters that started going out Tuesday won\u2019t be the final attempt to reach those with unresolved issues. HHS will try to contact each consumer two more times by phone and once via email. The administration is also working with local organizations to try to reach people directly in their homes.\n\nConsumers can also contact HealthCare.gov\u2019s call center at 800-318-2596 to see what documents they need to submit and see whether their information has been received.\n\nThe notices affect this year\u2019s coverage only.\n\nThe open enrollment period for this year is over. Open enrollment season for 2015 coverage doesn\u2019t start until Nov. 15. At that point, consumers will be able to renew or make changes in their coverage, and new customers can find out whether there\u2019s a plan that\u2019s right for them.\n\nUnder the law, most Americans are required to have health insurance or risk fines.\n\n(TM and \u00a9 Copyright 2014 CBS Radio Inc. and its relevant subsidiaries.
