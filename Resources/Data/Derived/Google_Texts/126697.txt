Through the eyes of the Department of Human Services, looking after less than 7 children is considered a small home daycare.

It's an issue that some home daycare providers think will run them out of business. This week, the OKC City Council will consider possible changes in the way those providers operate.

Heather Giddings has been running a home daycare for the past four years. She looks after 12 kids, five days a week with the help of an assistant.

Through the eyes of the Department of Human Services, looking after 7 or less children is considered a small home daycare. The agency says anything over that number is considered large, but the city's proposed ordinance would change that ratio to five or more.

"For me, if I have to go from 12 children to five I would have two of my own children that would count in this ratio," said Heather Giddings, large home daycare provider. "I would have to go to three children or the income of three children."

Giddings says, if approved, large home daycares would essentially have to follow center requirements. It will include having to install a commercial dishwasher and ventilation in kitchen and bathrooms.

"Pretty livid because this would completely affect me financially," said Misty Caplinger, small home daycare provider.

Caplinger runs a small home daycare and has been trying to get a straight answer from someone over at City Hall about the proposal.

"Some of them don't know what we're talking about. They're playing it off like you have to talk to this person," said Caplinger. "They keep giving you the runaround about who you have to talk too.

A group of home child care providers will meet Monday night to come up with a game plan before they present their argument to city council on Tuesday.
