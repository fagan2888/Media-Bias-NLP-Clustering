Mason Rudolph has been getting most of the attention as Oklahoma State gets practice underway this preseason.

Rudolph was named the starting quarterback going into spring based on his performance in the final three games last season.

J.W. Walsh had been the starter last year until an ankle injury sidelined him for the season.

Now he's the backup, but he knows he's just one play away from being the top QB again.
