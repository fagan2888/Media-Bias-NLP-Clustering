CC By 2.0\n\nAs the world warms, climate change continues to stoke a deep thirst with human demand growing for a supply of freshwater that is ebbing. This century, 40 percent more people around the globe will face what sounds like an advertisement for premium vodka: Absolute water scarcity.\n\nIn a new study, investigators used an \u201cunprecedented\u201d number of impact models to predict water supply amid rising greenhouse gas emissions and changing patterns in rainfall and evaporation, finding a major threat to human development.\n\n\"The steepest increase of global water scarcity might happen between 2 and 3 degrees global warming above pre-industrial levels, and this is something to be experienced within the next few decades unless emissions get cut soon,\" Jacob Schewe, an investigator with the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research. \"It is well-known that water scarcity increases, but our study is the first to quantify the relative share that climate change has in that, compared to \u2014 and adding to \u2014 the increase that is simply due to population growth.\"\n\nAside from maneuverings over the melting and resource-rich Arctic, water politics \u2014 but hopefully not water wars \u2014 will affect much of the globe. Today, one to two percent of the world population resides in countries facing absolute water scarcity, defined as less than 500 cubic meters available per year per person. By comparison, the average person on earth consumes roughly 1,200 cubic meters of water per year, with significantly greater use in more industrialized countries.\n\nAmong regions of the world expected to face absolute water scarcity in places are the Mediterranean, Middle East, southern U.S. states, and the south of China. Substantial problems will also be experienced in eastern Africa, western China, and southern India, according to Qiuhong Tang, of the Chinese Academy of Sciences.\n\n\"Water scarcity is a major threat for human development, as for instance food security in many regions depends on irrigation \u2014 agriculture is the main water user worldwide,\" Qiuhong. \"Still, an increase of precipitation is also challenging \u2014 the additional water may cause water logging, flooding, and malfunctioning or failure of water-related infrastructure. So the overall risks are growing.\"\n\nAside from maintaining the human population and livestock, industrial processes, such as fracking, and many kinds of manufacturing, consume considerable amounts of water, indicating an economic cost as well. To get this look at the future, investigators based the study on a set of 11 global hydrological models, interacting with five different models for global climate change.\n\nMoreover, the uniquely complex assessment allows investigators to \u201cunderstand which findings are most robust, says Pavel Kabat, of the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis. \"From a risk management perspective, it becomes very clear that, if human-made climate change continues, we are putting at risk the very basis of life for millions of people, even according to the more optimistic scenarios and models.\"\n\nHowever, the model is still a bit too facile. Kabat says investigators should examine how the water shortage will develop in different sectors, such as agriculture, industry, and energy \u2014 and how mitigating technology and practices may help.\n\nSource: Schewe, J., Heinke, J., Gerten, D.
