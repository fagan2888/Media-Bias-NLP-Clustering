(AP) - Geocaching, a high-tech game of hide-and-seek, is growing in popularity faster than kudzu on a hot summer day.\n\nShawn Harris of Poplarville said he began geocaching in 2009. At that time, Harris said there were between 500,000 and 600,000 geocaches worldwide.\n\n\u201cNow, it\u2019s over 2 million caches,\u201d Harris said. \u201cSo, it\u2019s about quadrupled.\u201d\n\nThe number of geocachers is growing, too.\n\nHarris said in 2009 there were between 3 million and 4 million playing the game. At last count, there were more than 6 million.\n\nSo, what are these millions of people actually doing? They are looking for hidden treasures, but not the kind that will make their checking account balances look like Donald Trump\u2019s.\n\nCaches are typically small, water-tight containers that include a trinket or some other prize as well as a log for the finder to sign and date. The cache finder can take the prize but is expected to leave something of equal value for the next person who locates it. Other caches can be clues to a puzzle, coordinates to another cache, or merely a location with a geographic feature that the hunter answers a series of questions by what they observe.\n\nPatricia McCarthy of Starkville said they can be hidden right under your nose. McCarthy said lamp posts in public access parking lots are one of the more common spots, but caches near bridges or buried next to stop signs are also popular hiding places.\n\nThe cache locations are listed on www.geocaching.com in the form of GPS coordinates. To find them, \u201cYou can low-tech or high-tech, and the best use a combination,\u201d McCarthy said. High-tech, for example, is a GPS device while low-tech may be an online satellite view such as Google Maps.\n\n\u201cYou can use landmarks from the satellite views and triangulate,\u201d McCarthy said.\n\nThis low-tech approach puts the thrill in the hunt for McCarthy, but others are looking for convenience. And they don\u2019t have to look far.\n\nSmartphones are more common than wrist watches these days, and the technology to participate in geocaching is at almost everyone\u2019s fingertips. Harris thinks that is one of the reasons for the rising popularity of geocaching.\n\n\u201cI think you could attribute the growth to that,\u201d Harris said. \u201cIt\u2019s more accessible.\u201d\n\nThat is especially true with the younger crowd.\n\nWesley Roberts, 20, of Brandon said he began geocaching in high school and strictly uses his cellular phone and a geocaching app that he downloaded. Those tools recently led him to a cache hidden inside a lamp post in Flowood.\n\n\u201cI always use my phone,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cThere are different methods, but I\u2019ve never tried them.\u201d\n\nThe ease of use of the smartphone is one aspect Roberts said he enjoys and would not have started caching without it, but the social side of tracking down treasure is what keeps him going.\n\n\u201cDoing it by yourself isn\u2019t the same as doing it with your friends and everybody having a great time,\u201d Roberts said.\n\nSandra Sarich of Monticello said she and her husband started geocaching in 2007 quite by accident.\n\n\u201cMy husband and I were at this garage sale and he bought this old GPS,\u201d Sarich said. For $10, it seemed like they couldn\u2019t go wrong.\n\nThe two decided to put the unit to use by trying geocaching. On their first outing, the only thing they found was that the device didn\u2019t work, but they did get bitten by the geocaching bug. The pair bought a new GPS and have been at it since.\n\nThese days, however, Sarich said she uses her smartphone and a geocaching app. \u201cTo me, it was the greatest thing they ever came out with,\u201d Sarich said. \u201cI find it easier and more convenient.\n\n\u201cI personally know a lot of new cachers, and they almost all use their phones.\u201d\n\nOn the opposite end of the spectrum, Tim O\u2019Bryant wasn\u2019t drawn to geocaching because the convenient technology. He became interested because of the inconveniences and the more, the better.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always been an outdoorsman, hunting and fishing,\u201d O\u2019Bryant said. \u201cI saw an opportunity to try something new outdoors.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Bryant, of Columbus, is a logger by trade but also is a scuba diver and avid kayaker. Tying his pursuits together, O\u2019Bryant tackles the caches that require climbing trees, paddling rivers or diving into the depths.\n\n\u201cThose are the kinds of caches that drive me,\u201d O\u2019Bryant said. \u201cIt\u2019s just the challenge of the hunt. It takes you to places you normally wouldn\u2019t go.\u201d\n\nHarris said this mix-and-match approach is now more common and also plays a part in geocaching\u2019s popularity.\n\n\u201cIt can be combined with hiking, kayaking or cycling,\u201d Harris said. \u201cIt makes it kind of an added bonus.\u201d\n\n___\n\nOnline\n\nGeocaching, http://www.geocaching.com\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The Clarion-Ledger, http://www.clarionledger.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "Geocaching, a high-tech game of hide-and-seek, is growing in popularity faster than kudzu on a hot summer day.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/feb/8/number-of-geocachers-growing-topping-6m/", "site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "type": "article", "description": "Geocaching, a high-tech game of hide-and-seek, is growing in popularity faster than kudzu on a hot summer day.", "title": "Number of geocachers growing; topping 6M"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "description": "Geocaching, a high-tech game of hide-and-seek, is growing in popularity faster than kudzu on a hot summer day.", "card": "summary", "title": "Number of geocachers growing; topping 6M"}, "Author": "BRIAN ALBERT BROOM", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Shawn Harris, Patricia Mccarthy"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda274\"", "article_summary": "\u201cNow, it\u2019s over 2 million caches,\u201d Harris said.\n\u201cMy husband and I were at this garage sale and he bought this old GPS,\u201d Sarich said.\n\u201cSo, it\u2019s about quadrupled.\u201dThe number of geocachers is growing, too.\n(AP) - Geocaching, a high-tech game of hide-and-seek, is growing in popularity faster than kudzu on a hot summer day.\nHarris said in 2009 there were between 3 million and 4 million playing the game."}
