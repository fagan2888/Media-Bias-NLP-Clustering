I had fonder feelings for others \u2014 including a few, such as Dr. Ben Carson, Bobby Jindal and Scott Walker \u2014 whom I didn\u2019t feel were qualified to be the Commander-in-Chief.\n\nBut that was then and this is now, and quite frankly, I don\u2019t understand those who either intend to sit out the election in November or even vote for Hillary Clinton. After all this time, I don\u2019t wish to list all the reasons I didn\u2019t want Trump to be the GOP standard bearer. But that list would read like the forward to a 600-page book dealing with the multiple sins and failings of Mrs. Clinton.\n\nWhether dealing with her tenure as First Lady, when she divided her time between stealing FBI files; trying to shove Hillary\u2019s version of the Affordable Care Act down our throats 20 years before Obama succeeded; fending off her husband\u2019s accusers by dismissing the women he abused as sluts and trailer park trash; her lack of accomplishment as a U.S. senator; or her miserable term as Secretary of State, which saw Iraq and Syria fall to the terrorists, while she and her re-set button encouraged Russian inroads in the Middle East and Ukraine; it is a record rife with blind partisanship, blatant corruption and lousy judgment.\n\nIn addition, she used a private server, which was about as private as the P.A. system at a train station, divulging state secrets to China, Russia and at least one Romanian hacker; a greed so consuming that it encouraged foreign entities to disguise bribes as donations to the family foundation even when she held a Cabinet position; and a vow to continue the Obama policies that have done so much to destroy the coal and oil industries, along with the economy and our relations with former allies in Europe and the Middle East.\n\nIf all that isn\u2019t reason enough to reconsider voting for her or easing her path to victory by staying home on Election Day, how about listening once again to Hillary Rodham, attorney, cackling on the 40-year-old tape as she celebrated getting a creep off with a slap on the wrist for raping a 12-year-old?\n\nThe fact that she would even consider putting herself forth as a defender of women, and that millions of women are willing to swallow the self-serving swill, merely proves that her gall is only surpassed by their gullibility.\n\nA picture of her and her husband, the aging lecher, has gone viral. It shows her declaring: \u201cIt\u2019s time to have a woman in the Oval Office\u201d and a smirking Bill responding: \u201cBeen there, done that.\u201d\n\nIt would astound me if any past or current member of the U.S. military would ever consider her the lesser of two evils when compared to Donald Trump. Anyone who has read Ron Kessler\u2019s informative books about the First Families is aware \u2014 whether it was agents of the Secret Service or members of the military who crossed her path when she was last in the White House \u2014 that the mere sight of a uniform or of a guy sworn to take a bullet for her would have Hillary launching a volley of f-bombs. The First Lady was and is definitely no lady.\n\nThere was a reason that had nothing to do with partisan politics that caused the crew of the Marine One helicopter, according to Kessler, to nickname the craft \u201cBroomstick One\u201d whenever she was aboard.\n\nWhile we await the conclusion of the FBI investigation of Mrs. Clinton, the speech police department of the Justice Department has decided that \u201cfelons\u201d and \u201cconvicts\u201d are prejudicial words and will be changed henceforth to \u201cperson who committed a crime\u201d or \u201cperson who was incarcerated.\u201d Yes, that\u2019s ever so much better. The terms just skip trippingly off the tongue, and, best of all, rapists, thieves and murderers, won\u2019t have their tender feelings bruised.\n\nStill, if that\u2019s what it takes, I\u2019ll be only too happy to refer to Hillary Clinton as \u201ca person who has committed a crime and has been incarcerated.\u201d\n\nSpeaking of laws, Congress passed 114 of them last year, which, in turn, enabled unelected bureaucrats to pass 3,410 regulations, costing the typical American family $15,000! No wonder the Democrats want to keep raising the minimum wage. It isn\u2019t so unskilled workers can support their wives and kids, but so we can all support thousands of bureaucratic troublemakers.\n\nIs it possible that as awful as ObamaCare is, it\u2019s actually saving millions of American lives by keeping a great many of us out of the hands of medical professionals? The question occurs to me because a recent report disclosed that the third leading cause of death in this country, trailing only cancer and heart disease, is medical error.\n\nOn the one hand, if you don\u2019t seek medical attention, you may die. On the other hand, at least a doctor won\u2019t be dunning your widow for killing you.\n\nUp until now, I have felt that even after 15 years and over 1800 political columns, I have somehow flown under the radar of all but a few precious readers. I haven\u2019t been called before a congressional committee, been invited on Fox or asked to substitute for a vacationing Rush Limbaugh.\n\nBut, now, I think my halcyon days of anonymity may be over. That\u2019s because one of my readers who had been receiving my articles at his government email address has been notified that he runs the risk of facing criminal charges if he persists.\n\nAccording to Department regulations 7-3.b, there\u2019s a whole passel of things that could set off these alarms, but my reader finally narrowed it down to #2 on the list: \u201cEmail messages or file attachments that contain any profane, obscene, sexist or racist materials or other materials that could be considered offensive.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m not often guilty of profanity or obscenity, if you don\u2019t get too perturbed by the occasional \u201cschmuck,\u201d so I guess sharing my true sentiments about Black Lives Matter, Islam, Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders, the DNC, the ladies of NOW and campus fascists, just finally got to be too much for the government snoop. Fortunately, my reader can now receive my treasures at home without the risk of being brought up on charges. At least not until Big Brother catches on.\n\nGetting back to Trump, if the GOP elite think they\u2019d have a hard time getting re-elected if they support Trump, they should take a deep breath and consider their odds if they simply stand by and help Mrs. Clinton get elected.\n\nAs it is, the GOP will have its work cut out for them, which is nothing new. That\u2019s because starting with the 1992 presidential election, the Democrat has carried 19 states and Washington, D.C. That adds up to 242 electoral votes. During that same period, the Republican candidate has won all six times in just 13 states representing a skimpy 102 electoral votes. Inasmuch as it takes 270 to be elected, if the Democrats merely carry Florida with its 29 electors, their side wins.\n\nWhenever I\u2019m in my car, I listen to talk radio. Because Dennis Prager and Michael Medved are on my favorite radio station here in L.A. from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m., they\u2019re the two I hear most often. Although I tend to agree with their take on politics, neither of them seems able to contain his contempt of TV. At least once a week, one or both of them feels compelled to heap abuse on the medium I\u2019m sure they both wish would hire them.\n\nBecause it was Prager who went on at some length this morning excoriating TV, it was to him that I addressed my rebuke.\n\n\u201cDear Mr. Prager: I don\u2019t wish to be impertinent, but your anti-TV screeds make you sound like someone who is not only a snob, but a snob who doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s talking about. As a result, your condemnation comes off as condescension that says far more about you than it does about television.\n\n\"I am not trying to make a case for the drivel that often permeates the tube if you stick to the three major networks day and night. I don\u2019t happen to watch very much, limiting myself for the most part to baseball games featuring the suddenly pathetic New York Yankees; an occasional old movie on TCM; Bret Baier\u2019s daily show on Fox; and \"Media Buzz\u201d and Chris Wallace on Sunday mornings.\n\n\u201cBut people who are every bit as smart as you are watch a great deal of highbrow fare on the History and Discovery channels, along with the occasional Ken Burns' multi-part documentary devoted to the Civil War, baseball. national parks, jazz, Prohibition and the Roosevelts, etc.\n\n\"Moreover, TV has also been responsible for most of the decent comedy over the past 60 years, including shows starring Sid Caesar, Phil Silvers and Jackie Gleason, along with such ensemble comedies as \"Barney Miller,\u201d \u201cFawlty Towers,\u201d \u201cCorner Gas,\u201d \u201cSeinfeld\u201d and \u201cFrasier.\u201d\n\n\u201cInasmuch as you never mention what you watch or if you watch at all, I don\u2019t know the basis for your low opinion, but judging TV by its worst product strikes me as being foolishly elitist, on a par with condemning motion pictures based on Adam Sandler movies or judging music by commercial jingles or art by French postcards.\n\n\"At least, unlike your colleague Michael Medved, who also trashes the medium every chance he gets, you don\u2019t then embarrass yourself by devoting precious air time to reviewing every piece of crapola Hollywood sends his way.
