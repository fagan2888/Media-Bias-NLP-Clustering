Police have arrested two teenagers for shooting at another group of teens at a skate park.

The shooting happened around 7:30 Friday evening in the southeast corner of Aley Park in the 1800 block of South Seneca. That area of the park operates as a city skate park and is also near Stanley Elementary School.

Sgt. Roger Runft said four teens were at the park when two others showed up, one pulling a gun and firing at the teens.

Officers arrived and found the two juveniles and took them into custody. They were booked for aggravated assault. Their names and ages were not released.
