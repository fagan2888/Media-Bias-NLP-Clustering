Kelly, a Chicago-based media strategist.In the past month, Emanuel has:\u2022 debuted on CNN\u2019s Robert Redford-produced reality series Chicagoland \u2022 been featured in this month\u2019s Esquire magazine \"with lots of prose about how Emanuel 'inherited' most of Chicago\u2019s ailments. (Hint: It\u2019s not his fault!),\" according to Kelly\u2022 sat with New York Times columnist David Brooks for a Brookings Institute live audience forum to discuss how Chicago policy has innovated under Emanuel\u2019s tutelage\u2022 penned a full-page article in the Chicago Sun-Times trumpeting the Windy City\u2019s \"inspiring digital future;\u2022 appeared on \"The Tonight Show\" with Jimmy Fallon to take the annual \"Polar Plunge\" in Chicago\u2019s frigid temps.And later this month, Emanuel will join billionaire Sam Zell as a featured speaker at Steve Forbes\u2019 \"Reinventing America\" summit, where he will discuss the heartland and topics such as \"cheap energy, innovative manufacturing, and job creation.\"\"All noteworthy planks for a potential platform,\" the Times notes.Kelly opines that it\u2019s too soon to know what higher office Emanuel might be seeking \u2014 he added Illinois Republican Sen. Mark Kirk\u2019s seat to the mix \u2013 but \"clearly, the campaign is under way.\"To be successful, the man known as both Rahmbo and mayor of the 1 percent has lots of work to do to rehab his public image, according to Kelly.His poll numbers in Chicago are in the tank, Kelly writes, and Moody\u2019s recently downgraded the city\u2019s credit rating after the City Council\u2019s approval of Emanuel\u2019s idea to borrow $1 billion. And that\u2019s not Emanuel\u2019s only \"political black eye.\"\"Chicagoans don\u2019t like that Emanuel has shut down Chicago Public Schools in favor of the taxpayer-funded charter schools that his pals have a financial interest in,\" according to Kelly. \"Chicagoans don\u2019t like that he has put their children in the gang cross hairs by the closing of those schools.\"Last week, when Emanuel finally admitted some responsibility for Chicago\u2019s epic homicide spike in 2012, he couched it as the 'slow' response of police to splintered gangs. So the Chicago Police don\u2019t like Emanuel either.\"", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Rahm Emanuel,Chicago,president,election", "pubdate": "2014-03-12T08:02:26", "og": {"site_name": "Newsmax", "description": "Chicago Mayor and former Obama Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel appears to be circling the wagon of a 2016 presidential run, according to The Washington Times.", "title": "Rahm Emanuel May Be Prepping for Presidential Run", "url": "http://www.newsmax.com/Politics/Rahm-Emanuel-Chicago-president-election/2014/03/12/id/559024/", "type": "article", "image": "http://www.newsmax.com/CMSPages/GetFile.aspx?guid=f3190644-5e0d-4d2a-b49c-a65d007e082a&SiteName=Newsmax", "page_id": 85452072376}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.newsmax.com/Politics/Rahm-Emanuel-Chicago-president-election/2014/03/12/id/559024/", "title": "Rahm Emanuel May Be Prepping for Presidential Run", "description": "Chicago Mayor and former Obama Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel appears to be circling the wagon of a 2016 presidential run, according to The Washington Times.", "site": "Newsmax"}, "fb": {"admins": 100002083767056, "app_id": 323020797885219}, "msvalidate.01": "FAF1322EC761685A5DD9344A1C19E82A", "epoch": 1394611346, "google-site-verification": "Jt2HUKgzJJw9VwIQJv31ETytuvNNm5ypTWN6j0nYvHM", "keywords": "Rahm Emanuel,Chicago,president,election", "article": {"section": "Politics", "published_time": "2014-03-12T08:02:26"}, "original-source": "http://www.newsmax.com/Politics/Rahm-Emanuel-Chicago-president-election/2014/03/12/id/559024/", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "description": "Chicago Mayor and former Obama Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel appears to be circling the wagon of a 2016 presidential run, according to The Washington Times."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9a74\"", "article_summary": "So the Chicago Police don\u2019t like Emanuel either.\"\n\"\"Chicagoans don\u2019t like that Emanuel has shut down Chicago Public Schools in favor of the taxpayer-funded charter schools that his pals have a financial interest in,\" according to Kelly.\n\"Last week, when Emanuel finally admitted some responsibility for Chicago\u2019s epic homicide spike in 2012, he couched it as the 'slow' response of police to splintered gangs.\nChicago Mayor and former Obama Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel appears to be circling the wagon of a 2016 presidential run, according to The Washington Times Two unidentified political strategists at the recent Conservative Political Action Conference postulated on possible and probable candidates, and Emanuel\u2019s name was bandied about.\n\"Chicagoans don\u2019t like that he has put their children in the gang cross hairs by the closing of those schools."}
