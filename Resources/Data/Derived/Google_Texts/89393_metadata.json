Paul] Ryan confirms GOP \u201cprinciples\u201d will include legal status for the 11 million, but he also says this will be a \u201cprobationary status\u201d to make sure the 11 million will not be \u201cpreferenced over people who did follow the laws.\u201d \u2026 Ryan also says the undocumented will be allowed to work as part of \u201cprobationary\u201d status before security benchmarks are met. \u201cYou can be on probation,\u201d Ryan says, \u201cwhile the border is being secured.\u201d\n\nSo, legal status for 11 million illegal aliens, before anyone even pretends the U.S. borders are secured. Just the thing Americans need when long-term unemployment is at record levels in virtually every state.\n\nPaul Ryan just wrote off ever being president by pushing amnesty when millions of Americans are unemployed, underemployed. @DRUDGE_REPORT \u2014 Matt Maggio (@MaggioMatt) January 29, 2014\n\nNo wonder Rep. Ryan, \u201cthe most pro-amnesty member of Congress,\u201d rose to his feet to clap last night when President Obama urged Congress to enact immigration reform.\n\nWasn't it a special moment to find Paul Ryan-0 applauding for Amnesty with fellow Dems #tcot #teaparty #GOP \u2014 Laurence (@Laurence4LiberT) January 29, 2014\n\nAs for concerns about the poor and rising income inequality, well, never mind all that!\n\nTwitchy readers may recall that Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., pushed a similar bill last year. That bill didn\u2019t go over so well with conservatives. On the other hand, it did win the endorsement of \u201cHomeland\u201d terrorist Abu Nazir. So there\u2019s that.\n\nThe Daily Caller\u2019s Mickey Kaus, as usual, sees through the pro-amnesty smokescreen:\n\n@ThePlumLineGS @chucktodd So much for leadership plans for fake \"enforcement must be in place\" requirement? \u2014 Mickey Kaus (@kausmickey) January 29, 2014\n\n@ThePlumLineGS @chucktodd Simple deal is do enforcement then have amnesty. Dems say \"non starter\" b/c then might actually get enforcement \u2014 Mickey Kaus (@kausmickey) January 29, 2014\n\nBingo.\n\nRelated:\n\nBuzzfeed says amnesty advocate Paul Ryan is on a mission to help the poor; Mickey Kaus calls BS\n\nWashington Post: Paul Ryan called illegal aliens \u2018exploited Americans\u2019\n\nMickey Kaus: If Obama were really worried about rising inequality, he wouldn\u2019t be pushing immigration bill\n\nWant US workers to earn more?
