We are $17 trillion in debt with no plan to repay it. ObamaPhone, ObamaCare. Now, ObamaNet. We badly need a Waste Cutter in Washington.\u201d\n\nZeigler, whose Facebook page is titled \u201cZeigler: Waste Cutter\u201d, has shown willingness to slash costs before, cutting around 8% of his office\u2019s budget \u2014 almost $200,000 \u2014 for the 2016 fiscal year, which will begin in October of this year.\n\nThe FCC\u2019s new proposal would give a $9.25 per month subsidy for broadband in addition to cell and landline phone service. The program is funded by fees paid by cell phone customers as listed on their telephone bills.\n\nRepublican commissioners on the FCC understand Zeigler\u2019s frustrations.\n\n\u201cWe still have a long way to go if we are going to fix this program,\u201d said Commissioner Ajit Pai. \u201cWaste fraud and abuse are still rampant.\u201d\n\nMichael O\u2019Rielly, the other FCC Republican, stated \u201cIt is clear that the majority wants to spend as much as it possibly can\u201d before the administration changes in January of 2017.\n\nAnimosity towards ObamaNet is everywhere in Congress. Opponents have called for its budget to be capped and for individuals receiving subsidies to be charged co-pays. \u201cBefore again expanding the program, we need to consider what problems remain and how we can address them, since consumers are bearing the cost of funding the program with increasing phone bills,\u201d said Sen. Roger Wicker (R-Miss.) at a hearing last month.\n\nAs of now, The FCC is seeking comments on whether the program should have a set budget and what metrics could be used to better judge the efficiency of the program. Zeigler says he intends to issue formal comments which will go beyond the narrow subject matter called for by the commission. \u201cI will oppose the program,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Jim Zeigler took aim at President Obama, announcing his anger at the FCC's newest program to subsidize internet connection for low-income people", "og": {"site_name": "Yellowhammer News", "description": "MOBILE, Ala. \u2014 Republican State Auditor Jim Ziegler immediately attacked a new program he dubbed \u201cObamaNet\u201d on his Facebook page after the Federal Communications Commission announced last Thursday plans to[...]", "title": "Alabama auditor slams 'ObamaNet' subsidies: 'We have got to stop these giveaways' - Yellowhammer News", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 840, "identifier": "http://yellowhammernews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/rsz_zeigler.jpg", "height": 415}, "updated_time": "2015-06-23T09:40:13-05:00", "url": "http://yellowhammernews.com/politics-2/alabama-auditor-slams-obamanet-subsidies-we-have-got-to-stop-these-giveaways/", "type": "article"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "1bb21e647809aaf739789565c0783008"}, "fb": {"pages": 303363616352436}, "article": {"section": "Politics", "tag": "state auditor", "published_time": "2015-06-22T12:45:28-05:00", "modified_time": "2015-06-23T09:40:13-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "\u201cThe Federal Communications Commission is moving forward with Obama\u2019s plan for Internet subsidies for low-income folks,\u201d Zeigler wrote.\nThe three Democrats on the FCC\u2019s governing commission voted to expand their controversial \u201cObamaPhone\u201d program to add subsidies to those who cannot afford broadband Internet service.\nOpponents have called for its budget to be capped and for individuals receiving subsidies to be charged co-pays.\nZeigler says he intends to issue formal comments which will go beyond the narrow subject matter called for by the commission.\n\u201cWe still have a long way to go if we are going to fix this program,\u201d said Commissioner Ajit Pai."}
