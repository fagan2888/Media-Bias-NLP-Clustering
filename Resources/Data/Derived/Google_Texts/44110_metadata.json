Cash incentives to curb obesity in the U.K.\n\nLONDON (CNNMoney) \u2014 Overweight Brits may soon find that shedding extra pounds would benefit their wallets as well as their waistlines.\n\nThe UK public health service, the NHS, wants to encourage companies to reward employees who lose excess weight and maintain a healthy lifestyle.\n\nDubbed the \u2018pounds for pounds\u2019 program by Britain\u2019s biggest-selling newspaper The Sun, the initiative is part of a plan to tackle an NHS funding shortfall that is forecast to hit \u00a330 billion ($48 billion) by 2020.\n\nNHS executives plan to ask the cash-strapped government for \u00a38 billion, but the rest will have to come from savings, including reducing spending on weight-related illness.\n\n\u201cPut bluntly, as the nation\u2019s waistline keeps piling on the pounds, we\u2019re piling on billions of pounds in future taxes just to pay for preventable illnesses,\u201d the NHS said.\n\nAlmost two thirds of English adults are overweight or obese, with low income groups worst affected, according to official data.\n\nOnly a handful of countries, including the U.S., Mexico and Australia have higher obesity rates.\n\nEmployees who manage to curb their unhealthy habits could be offered cash, shopping vouchers or prizes. The NHS declined to comment on the likely size of the incentives, but said some of the funding could come from taxpayers.\n\nObese people are more at risk of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, degenerative joint diseases and some cancers, according to the World Health Organization.\n\nThe NHS proposal \u2014 which comes about six months before the U.K. election \u2014 follows similar efforts by companies in the U.S. to encourage their workers to get fit.\n\nIt hopes to save money and reduce the number of sick days people take. Sickness-related absence costs UK employers and taxpayers about $35 billion a year, the NHS said.\n\nIndividuals miss out on $6.4 billion a year in lost earnings.\n\nThere\u2019s evidence that dangling a juicy carrot works. A study by the Mayo Clinic, ranked the best U.S. hospital in 2014, found that 62% of obese people offered $20 a month succeeded in meeting their weight loss targets.\n\nJust 26% of people given no financial incentive managed to hit their goals.", "article_metadata": {"description": "LONDON (CNNMoney) -- Overweight Brits may soon find that shedding extra pounds would benefit their wallets as well as their waistlines.
