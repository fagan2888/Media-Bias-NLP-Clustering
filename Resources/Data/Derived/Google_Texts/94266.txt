Some people who appear to be checking out the famous house from the 90s hit TV show “Full House” in San Francisco apparently weren’t paying close attention to who else was nearby.

John Stamos, the actor who played the beloved character Uncle Jesse, happened to be visiting the home at the same time.

He was right next to the fans that completely missed his presence.

Stamos posted a photo of himself near the onlookers to his Instagram page Friday and wrote, “Boy, these youngsters have 0.0 idea what they’re missing. #FullHousehouse #TURNAROUND.”

The home was featured in the opening credits of each episode of “Full House,” which aired from 1987 until 1995.
