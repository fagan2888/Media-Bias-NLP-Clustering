Furthermore, just one-third of poll participants believe the country is headed in the right direction.\n\nThe poll's director, Mark DiCamillo, believes the poll is a \"much more deflating reflection of how people view the leadership of Obama.\"\n\n\"At the beginning of the year, after his re-election, they felt great. They are not feeling that way anymore. They think the country is moving in the wrong direction even with their Democrat in the White House,\" DiCamillo told The Sacramento Bee.\n\nThe California Field Poll reflects growing trends in the President's disapproval rating throughout the country.\n\nHarvard's Institute of Politics released a recent poll revealing the President's approval rating at just 41 percent among young Americans ages 18 - 29-- the lowest level reported since the beginning of his presidency. Of that same age group, 47 percent would vote to recall President Obama today if it were possible.\n\nCalifornia's own state exchange, Covered California, has operated relatively smoothly in comparison to the national Health Insurance Marketplace, however the messy Obamacare rollout - defined by widespread policy cancellations and an unpredictable website - has influenced the opinions of California voters nonetheless. Half of California voters now disapprove of President Obama's handling of healthcare, according to the Field Poll.\n\nMoreover, the poll reveals a shocking increase in disapproval ratings among some of President Obama's largest and most loyal supporters: 16 percent among Latinos, 18 percent in union households and 13 percent among women in California, the poll showed.\n\nDuring a recent interview with Barbara Walters, President Obama commented on his approval numbers saying, \"The good thing about when you're down is that usually, you've got nowhere to go but up.\"\n\nThe Field Poll surveyed 766 registered voters in California from Nov. 14 to Dec. 1 with a margin of error plus or minus 3.5 percentage points.", "article_metadata": {"prism.subsection1": "specialreport", "prism.subsection3": "dailybret", "prism.subsection2": "blogs", "dcterms.modified": "2013-12-12T13:20:19-05:00", "dcterms.abstract": "By Special Report Intern/ Gabriella Morrongiello", "twitter": {"image": "http://www.foxnews.com/on-air/special-report-bret-baier/sites/foxnews.com.on-air.special-report-bret-baier/files/660-California-AP.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "dc.format": "text/html", "dc.publisher": "Fox News", "parsely-metadata": "{\"title\":\"President Obama's disapproval rating rises among California voters\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/www.foxnews.com\\/on-air\\/special-report-bret-baier\\/blog\\/2013\\/12\\/12\\/president-obamas-disapproval-rating-rises-among-california-voters\",\"image_url\":\"http:\\/\\/global.fncstatic.com\\/static\\/v\\/all\\/img\\/og\\/og-fn-special-report.jpg\",\"section\":\"specialreport\",\"author\":\"Fox News\",\"tags\":[\"California\",\"President Obama\",\"voters\"],\"type\":\"blog\",\"pub_date\":\"2013-12-12T13:19:17-05:00\"}", "prism.aggregationType": "blog", "keywords": "Special Report, Bret Baier, The Grapevine, Brit Hume\u2019s Commentary, All-Star Panelists, Interviews, Wednesday Web Show, SR Online, The Daily Bret, 2016, Politics, Washington DC, Fox News Channel, Fox News, shows, FNC, FoxNews.com", "prism.channel": "fnc", "dc.description": "By Special Report Intern/ Gabriella Morrongiello", "dc.identifier": "urn:uri:base64:cGFuZWwzNzE4", "dc.subject": "Special Report, Bret Baier, The Grapevine, Brit Hume\u2019s Commentary, All-Star Panelists, Interviews, Wednesday Web Show, SR Online, The Daily Bret, 2016, Politics, Washington DC, Fox News Channel, Fox News, shows, FNC, FoxNews.com", "description": "By Special Report Intern/ Gabriella Morrongiello", "prism.section": "shows", "fb": {"admins": 100000924384522, "app_id": 113186182048399}, "dc.language": "en-US", "dc.title": "President Obama's disapproval rating rises among California voters | Special Report | Bret Baier | Fox News Channel", "dcterms.created": "2013-12-12T13:19:17-05:00", "og": {"site_name": "Fox News", "description": "By Special Report Intern/ Gabriella Morrongiello", "title": "President Obama's disapproval rating rises among California voters | Special Report | Bret Baier | Fox News Channel", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/on-air/special-report-bret-baier/blog/2013/12/12/president-obamas-disapproval-rating-rises-among-california-voters", "image": "http://www.foxnews.com/on-air/special-report-bret-baier/sites/foxnews.com.on-air.special-report-bret-baier/files/660-California-AP.jpg", "type": "article"}, "dc.type": "Text.Article", "dc.date": "2013-12-12", "parsely-page": "{\"title\":\"President Obama's disapproval rating rises among California voters\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/www.foxnews.com\\/on-air\\/special-report-bret-baier\\/blog\\/2013\\/12\\/12\\/president-obamas-disapproval-rating-rises-among-california-voters\",\"image_url\":\"http:\\/\\/global.fncstatic.com\\/static\\/v\\/all\\/img\\/og\\/og-fn-special-report.jpg\",\"section\":\"specialreport\",\"author\":\"Bret Baier\",\"tags\":[\"California\",\"President Obama\",\"voters\"],\"type\":\"blog\",\"pub_date\":\"2013-12-12T13:19:17-05:00\",\"post_id\":\"23039\"}"}, "article_summary": "Half of California voters now disapprove of President Obama's handling of healthcare, according to the Field Poll.\nThe California Field Poll reflects growing trends in the President's disapproval rating throughout the country.\nAccording to a new Field Poll, 43 percent of California voters now disapprove of the President's performance-- an 8 percent increase since July.\nOf that same age group, 47 percent would vote to recall President Obama today if it were possible.\nPresident Obama's disapproval rating rises among California votersBy Special Report Intern/ Gabriella MorrongielloPresident Barack Obama has seen a significant decline in support since the botched rollout of his legacy healthcare legislation and voters in one of the country's bluest states have proved no exception."}
