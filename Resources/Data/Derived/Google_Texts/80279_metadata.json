If you thought the nickname \u201cQueen City: name came at the turn of the 20th century because the beachfront resort housed wealthy summer residents from Philadelphia in its grand hotels, and palatial summer cottages, think again.\n\nAccording to historian Jeanette Lloyd, \u201cWhen Atlantic City started to pick up steam in its popularity, an elected Beach Haven official sometime in the early 1900s decided to hop on the bandwagon and thought that naming it the Queen \"City\" might draw more tourists. And it stuck\u201d\n\nThe borough\u2019s emblem/seal bears that nickname and a crown, and though the name \u201cQueen City\u2019\u2019 may have nothing to do with it, Beach Haven, with all its amenities has always been a mecca for summer vacationers.\n\nAlthough the hotels and a beachfront boardwalk and other structures perished in storms in the 1940s, many of the beautiful old Victorian and Edwardian home remain. Most of them are in the Beach Haven Historic District which became listed in the New Jersey and the National Register of Historic Places in the early 1980s.\n\nThe first of the 125th anniversary celebrations is scheduled for May 9. There will be open houses at many of the public buildings, from 1 to 4 p.m.\n\nAt the New Jersey Maritime Museum between Dock Road and Centre Street at the bay, there will be a special guided tour from 1-3 p.m. by museum docents.

The Museum will be providing something warm to drink.\n\nA few blocks north on Third Street, artifacts from the little museum in the historic Beach Haven Public Library, can be seen during the open house.\n\nDuring the nation\u2019s bicentennial, Beach Haven quilters made a commemorative quilt. All of those who quilted parts of it will be invited May 9 to tell their stories and share in the celebration, and the public will be able to see the quilt.\n\nAs part of the celebration, ReClamtheBay.org will be doing live shellfish demonstrations at their Beach Haven location at 420 Pelham Ave, (the Old Coast Guard Station).\n\nReClam the Bay currently has more than 10,000 juvenile shellfish growing in its upweller (tank) that will eventually be planted in Barnegat Bay. Members will be on hand from 12-4 for hands- on demonstrations and questions.\n\nAnyone who grew up in Beach Haven can relive their childhood years by taking a guided tour of the historic Beach Haven School on May 9. The tours will run from 1-3 p.m. The Board of Education and the Beach Haven PTA will be guiding members of the public through the landmark to see what has changed through the years. Light refreshments will be available.\n\nMay 9 may be the start of the anniversary celebrations, but there will be more to come.\n\nOn May 24, there will be a \u201cthrowback\u201d softball game to celebrate the 125th anniversary of Beach Haven. The game will take place at Walsh Field, near the borough tennis courts and will pit past and present borough employees versus local firemen. Refreshments will be provided by Beach Haven Future an organization that is helping to beautify the town.\n\nThe softball game also will feature an appearance by \u201cMayor Gator\u201d from Fantasy Island Amusement Park, and the third inning stretch will include a Wing Eating Contest with wings supplied by The Chicken or the Egg. Announcements during the game will be made by Glenn Kalina from WJRZ radio.\n\nThe Beach Haven First Aid Squad on Engleside Avenue and the The Beach Haven Volunteer Fire Company #1 on Bay Avenue at Amber Street also will have open house celebrations on May 9, during which visitors can learn all about their life-saving programs and equipment (and maybe even volunteer!).\n\nThe fire company, the oldest one in Ocean County, was established on April 28, 1883. Along with its open house on May 9, a bigger event will be happening on Oct. 3. On that Saturday (of Chowderfest Weekened) there will be a triple housing at the firehouse for three pieces of equipment as well as a parade, and a rededication of rooms in the original section in the firehouse, which is 100 years old this year.\n\nOther 125th anniversary events planned include, Bay Bash\u201d pig roast at Walsh field on June 20 and a SUP Race/Bay Bash on Aug. 29, also at Walsh Field, The races on Aug. 29 will begin at 1 p.,m. and are sponsored by Beach Haven and South End Surf And Paddle. and hosted by the Little Egg Harbor Yacht Club.\n\nMore details on further anniversary celebrations will be published closer to the dates.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://on.app.com/1Gf2XkN", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Open house celebration coming up May 9", "og": {"site_name": "Asbury Park Press", "description": "Open house celebration coming up May 9", "title": "Get ready to sing \u2018Happy Birthday, Beach Haven\u2019", "url": "http://www.app.com/story/news/local/southern-ocean-county/2015/04/21/get-ready-sing-happy-birthday-beach-haven/26123647/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/app.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Open house celebration coming up May 9", "title": "Get ready to sing \u2018Happy Birthday, Beach Haven\u2019", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/4cd0d5f5c9417f2f072cc60b3ff7005dc1484ad5/c=114-0-1147-1033&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/AsburyPark/2015/04/21/B9317062371Z.1_20150421120359_000_GU4AID7P6.1-0.jpg", "creator": "@AsburyParkPress", "site": "@AsburyParkPress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600068887", "fb": {"app_id": 116172675120111}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070"}, "article_summary": "Anyone who grew up in Beach Haven can relive their childhood years by taking a guided tour of the historic Beach Haven School on May 9.\nBeach Haven was incorporated as a Borough by an Act of the New Jersey Legislature on Nov. 11, 1890, from portions of Eagleswood Township.\nRefreshments will be provided by Beach Haven Future an organization that is helping to beautify the town.\nand are sponsored by Beach Haven and South End Surf And Paddle.\nOn May 24, there will be a \u201cthrowback\u201d softball game to celebrate the 125th anniversary of Beach Haven."}
