Zane sells software that helps small businesses reimburse workers \u2014 with tax-free dollars! \u2014 when they buy their own individual insurance policies.\n\nAt least that is how it has worked so far. All of the lawyers and other experts we interviewed for the story told us that Zane\u2019s plan is probably not legal \u2014 or if it is, it will not be for long.\n\nBy coincidence, hours before that story was published, we received an email from Clinton Baller describing his own experience with Zane. Mr. Baller had long offered group insurance to his four employees (and himself) at Avid Payment Solutions, a credit card payment processing company in Birmingham, Mich. But late last year, his renewal notice prompted him to go looking for insurance on the new individual exchange created by the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cMy personal premium was going to go from $2,100 to $2,500 a month,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd one of my employees \u2014 she had a two-person policy, and she was going to go to $2,000, and I was contributing half.\u201d (Mr. Baller said that the increases for 2014 were no higher than the increases he had experienced in recent years, before the Affordable Care Act kicked in.) On the exchange, his employee found a policy that, after a subsidy provided through the law, would cost her only $150 and him $500 a month. When he learned about Zane and its promise that he could provide tax-free employer contributions, individual insurance seemed too good to pass up.\n\nAt the same time, Mr. Baller\u2019s sales manager, a former health insurance agent, got word that the state\u2019s Blue Cross/Blue Shield company was paying 3 percent commissions along with a $300 bonus for each individual policy an agent brought to the carrier \u2014 even if it was purchased on the government exchange. This, too, seemed irresistible, especially when packaged with Zane, which also pays a commission to agents who sell the company\u2019s software. So he started another company, an insurance agency, to sell employers on the Zane arrangement and employees on individual insurance.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t look at the A.C.A. and not realize the opportunity that is there,\u201d Mr. Baller said recently. \u201cSo the opportunity that we saw was not only to go out and sign up individuals, but to talk to businesses like mine that are being crushed by the premiums.\u201d If they succeeded, they\u2019d profit on two fronts: first when the business signed up with Zane and dropped group health insurance and then when the employees purchased their own insurance through his agency, the Baller Group.\n\nHe also decided to try to sell in the individual market, in particular to low-income African-Americans in Detroit, whom he figured are likely to be open to the health law, widely known as Obamacare, and to qualify for the subsidies that make it truly affordable. In this effort, the Baller Group uses the name 855-BAMA.\n\nBut at about the time we were reporting the article about Zane, Mr. Baller started hearing the same doubts about whether the Zane plan was legal. So where does that leave him?\n\nIn the late spring, Mr. Baller went back to Zane, several times. \u201cI pressed them really hard,\u201d he said. \u201cThey insist up and down what they\u2019re doing is legit. And frankly I believe it, because otherwise they\u2019d be shut down by now. And the people who are mostly arguing against it are the incumbents, who stand to lose when businesses decide to convert from group coverage to independent coverage.\u201d\n\nMr. Baller remained committed even after his own accountant spoke to a lawyer, who came back vehemently opposed to the idea. Mr. Baller chose not to talk to a lawyer himself. \u201cFirst of all, lawyers are just going to cost a lot of money and to evaluate something I\u2019m pretty able to evaluate on my own,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not settled. I don\u2019t think anyone can definitely say yes, it\u2019s legal, or no, it\u2019s not.\u201d\n\nStill, he does suspect that even if the Zane plan technically passes legal muster now, the Internal Revenue Service may well revise its rules to foreclose any opportunity for an employer to provide tax-free reimbursement for individual insurance.\n\nAs it happens, it\u2019s not an issue that has come up with a prospective client: the Baller Group has yet to convert any businesses from group coverage, though it has signed up 875 individuals. \u201cBusinesses don\u2019t feel enough pain yet,\u201d he said. \u201cThere isn\u2019t this massive realization that there\u2019s this alternative. So many of these business guys are Republicans who are so ideologically opposed to Obamacare that they\u2019re blind to the fact that it\u2019s law of the land, and the opportunities that are inherent to it.\u201d Suffice to say, he will not be making his case to business owners as 855-BAMA.\n\nMr. Baller thinks the day of reckoning may come in October, when small-business owners get their renewals for next year and perhaps face the kind of sticker shock he did. So what will he tell them about the chances that the Zane approach will survive legal challenge? \u201cI would just be personally honest with small businesses and say you could do it either way\u201d \u2014 using either pre-tax dollars or post-tax dollars. And he said he would advise them that some lawyers think the strategy is illegal: \u201cWe\u2019re going to be very careful about making representations about what these people are getting into.\u201d\n\nAs for his own company, Avid, Mr. Baller said he plans to wait until the end of the year before he decides whether his own contribution will be pretax or post-tax. He may decide to do it post-tax even if the I.R.S. does not rule on the issue this year. Giving his employees raises to cover the tax obligation on policies bought on the individual exchange will still save him money over a group plan.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re in a smaller group \u2014 three or four people \u2014 and they\u2019re all in their 50s, like our group, the policy premiums are high compared with an exchange policy,\u201d he said. \u201cPlus I can give my employees choice over what kind of policy they want.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"ptime": 20140825144933, "twitter": {"url": "http://boss.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/08/25/a-business-owner-stands-by-zane-benefits-controversial-health-insurance-plan-for-now/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "description": "Mr. Baller remained committed even after his own accountant spoke to a lawyer, who came back vehemently opposed to the idea.", "card": "summary", "title": "A Business Owner Stands By Zane Benefits' Controversial Health Insurance Plan (for Now)"}, "sourceApp": "blogs", "blogpostid": 100000003073792, "DISPLAYDATE": "August 25, 2014", "org": "Internal Revenue Service;Zane Benefits Inc", "keywords": "Federal Taxes (US),Health Insurance and Managed Care,Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (2010),Small Business,Internal Revenue Service,Zane Benefits Inc,The Agenda", "GBLC": "The Agenda", "communityAssetTaxonomy": "blogs/boss/A Business Owner Stands By Zane Benefits' Controversial Health Insurance Plan (for Now) ( 20140825 )", "news_keywords": "Federal Taxes,Health Insurance,IRS,Obamacare,Small business,Zane Benefits", "PT": "Blogs", "author": "Robb Mandelbaum", "SCG": "boss", "dfp-ad-unit-path": "boss", "CLMST": "Robb Mandelbaum", "byl": "Robb Mandelbaum", "BN": "boss", "adxPage": "blog.nytimes.com/boss/post", "description": "Mr. Baller remained committed even after his own accountant spoke to a lawyer, who came back vehemently opposed to the idea.", "robots": "noodp", "dat": "August 25, 2014", "article": {"tag": "The Agenda", "published_time": 1408992573, "modified_time": "2014-08-25T18:49:33-04:00", "collection": "http://json8.nytimes.com/services/json/sectionfronts/business/index.jsonp"}, "utime": 20140825184933, "communityAssetLabels": "NYT_Blogs", "PUD": 20140825, "pdate": 20140825, "des": "Federal Taxes (US);Health Insurance and Managed Care;Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (2010);Small Business", "thumbnail": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "og": {"site_name": "You\u2019re the Boss Blog", "description": "Mr. Baller remained committed even after his own accountant spoke to a lawyer, who came back vehemently opposed to the idea.", "title": "A Business Owner Stands By Zane Benefits' Controversial Health Insurance Plan (for Now)", "url": "http://boss.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/08/25/a-business-owner-stands-by-zane-benefits-controversial-health-insurance-plan-for-now/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/blogs_v5/../icons/t_logo_291_black.png", "type": "article"}, "communityAssetURL": "http://boss.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/08/25/a-business-owner-stands-by-zane-benefits-controversial-health-insurance-plan-for-now/", "PUV": "normal", "hdl": "A Business Owner Stands By Zane Benefits' Controversial Health Insurance Plan (for Now)", "thumbnail_150": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "PST": "Blog Post"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcad6c\"", "article_summary": "So he started another company, an insurance agency, to sell employers on the Zane arrangement and employees on individual insurance.\nBut at about the time we were reporting the article about Zane, Mr. Baller started hearing the same doubts about whether the Zane plan was legal.\nWhen he learned about Zane and its promise that he could provide tax-free employer contributions, individual insurance seemed too good to pass up.\n\u2014 when they buy their own individual insurance policies.\nMr. Baller had long offered group insurance to his four employees (and himself) at Avid Payment Solutions, a credit card payment processing company in Birmingham, Mich."}
