IRS agents, finding the returns suspect, raided his luxe bachelor pad a year later. In a 38-page trial memo last month, prosecutors said Fattah\u2019s companies were merely a shell for business loans he spent on \u201cextravagant personal living expenses.\u201d\n\nBut rather than cower in the midst of FBI stings that have netted his college roommate and two advisers to his father \u2014 U.S. Rep. Chaka Fattah Sr. \u2014 the younger Fattah has instead fought back, acting as his own lawyer.\n\nSome question that confidence in the face of a sweeping federal indictment. But \u201cChip\u201d Fattah, now 31, scored an early victory this month when a U.S. appeals court agreed to delay the case and review one of his countless legal challenges.\n\n\u201cIf I was still represented by counsel, then the trial would have started two weeks ago,\u201d the younger Fattah said.\n\nAs he spoke, he was working on a 55,000-word legal brief due Tuesday in the 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals.\n\n\u201cThe government has no idea what they\u2019re talking about in terms of most of the trial memo. Just in terms of details. Details that turn innocent conduct into criminal conduct,\u201d said the son, who insists he worked long hours for two years on the education contract.\n\nChip Fattah \u2014 reed-thin and always smiling \u2014 can talk a blue streak. But he paused, atypically, when asked how long he had lived with his father, a 10-term Philadelphia Democrat, before his parents divorced. His sister, Fran, is a lawyer running for city judge. Fattah Sr., 58, also has two young daughters with his third wife, local TV anchor Renee Chenault-Fattah.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve grown up at my mom\u2019s house. But my dad\u2019s always around. I\u2019ve spent summers and stuff in D.C.,\u201d he said.\n\nFattah studied business at Drexel University, but never earned a degree, citing financial difficulties and a college debt he says has grown to $120,000. (An entry on his LinkedIn page listed a B.S. degree, though he calls that \u201ca mistake.\u201d)", "article_metadata": {"description": "US Rep\u2019s son says he\u2019s \u2018collateral damage\u2019 in bid to get dad", "title": "US Rep\u2019s son says he\u2019s \u2018collateral damage\u2019 in bid to get dad", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "US Rep\u2019s son says he\u2019s \u2018collateral damage\u2019 in bid to get dad", "title": "US Rep\u2019s son says he\u2019s \u2018collateral damage\u2019 in bid to get dad", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/03/22/us_reps_son_says_hes_collateral_damage_in_bid_to_get_dad/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/03/congressmans-son-fraud-charges.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "US Rep\u2019s son says he\u2019s \u2018collateral damage\u2019 in bid to get dad", "title": "US Rep\u2019s son says he\u2019s \u2018collateral damage\u2019 in bid to get dad", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/03/congressmans-son-fraud-charges.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Maryclaire Dale", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Fattah Sr., 58, also has two young daughters with his third wife, local TV anchor Renee Chenault-Fattah.\n\u201cIf I was still represented by counsel, then the trial would have started two weeks ago,\u201d the younger Fattah said.\nDetails that turn innocent conduct into criminal conduct,\u201d said the son, who insists he worked long hours for two years on the education contract.\n\u201cThe government has no idea what they\u2019re talking about in terms of most of the trial memo.\nAs he spoke, he was working on a 55,000-word legal brief due Tuesday in the 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals."}
