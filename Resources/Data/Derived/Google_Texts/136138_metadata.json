These results show considerable promise for future trials on humans, a potential landmark in treating the condition, which affects roughly one in every three people worldwide.\n\nLead researcher of the study, Dr. Julian Paton of Britain\u2019s Bristol University, remarked that scientists have long known about the link between the carotid bodies and high blood pressure; however, they \u201chad absolutely no idea that they contributed so massively to the generation of high blood pressure,\u201d Reuters reports.\n\nCarotid bodies help regulate blood pressure in their interplay with levels of oxygen and carbon dioxide. When levels fall too low, the chemoreceptors raise blood pressure to increase breathing and distribution of oxygen throughout the body. Blocking the nervous system\u2019s receptors to the brain resulted in prolonged drops in blood pressure, as the carotid bodies could not properly communicate the signal.\n\nCarotid sinus denervation (CSD) \u201cremains effective, producing a summative response indicative of an independent mechanism,\u201d the researchers concluded. \u201cOur findings indicate that CB de-afferentation is an effective means for robust and sustained sympathoinhibition, which could translate to patients with neurogenic hypertension.\u201d\n\nPrecisely, the disconnect between nerves and brain is what Tony Heagerty, a professor of medicine at Manchester University who was not involved in the study, said could allow humans to \u201cpotentially avoid the use of drugs which have to be taken on a daily basis for many years.\"\n\nPaton\u2019s team has already begun work on a small human trial, the results of which are slated to arrive at the end of this year. If successful, the trial could revolutionize the way hypertension currently sees treatment.\n\nIn addition to dietary changes \u2014 more whole-grain breads, less salt, and limited alcohol consumption \u2014 a healthcare provider may prescribe medication to reduce the condition\u2019s severity. These medications typically include ACE inhibitors, ARBs, beta blockers, diuretics, and calcium channel blockers. While their mechanisms may differ, most hypertension medications are designed to relax the blood vessels, either through hormonal shifts or chemical changes.\n\nIf left unabated, high blood pressure could result in heart attack, stroke, or diabetes. People with high blood pressure won\u2019t know they have it until a physician checks specifically, making it particularly dangerous for people whose lifestyle has remained unhealthy for long stretches of time.\n\nSource: McBryde F, Abdala A, Hendy E.
