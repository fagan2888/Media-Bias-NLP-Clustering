Ted Cruz (R-Texas) has repeatedly called for the repeal and defunding of Obamacare, but is now going to sign up for it.\n\nSen. Cruz will no longer be covered by his wife's health insurance via her job at Goldman-Sachs because she has taken a leave of absence while her husband runs for president. Neither Sen. Cruz or his wife will be covered.\n\n\"We'll be getting new health insurance and we'll presumably do it through my job in the Senate, and so we'll be on the federal exchange like millions of others on the federal exchange,\" Cruz told CNN today (video below).\n\nSen. Cruz was asked repeatedly by CNN's Dana Bash if he would accept the U.S. government subsidy for health care that Congress receives, but he wouldn't answer directly. His spokesperson said later that he would refuse it.\n\nCNN reports that Sen. Cruz added:\n\nWhat is problematic about Obamacare is that it is killing millions of jobs in this country and has killed millions of jobs. It has forced millions of people into part time work. It has caused millions of people to lose their insurance, to lose their doctors and to face skyrocketing insurance premiums. That is unacceptable.\n\nHowever, Obamacare doesn't set premium rates, the health insurance companies and state regulators set the rates.\n\nUnemployment has actually gone down since Obamacare was passed in 2009, notes the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. The Wall Street Journal reported in 2014 that unemployment fell in every state, the first time that has happened since 1984.\n\nAccording to TheHill.com, Sen. Cruz opposed raising the federal minimum wage for American workers.\n\nSources: CNN, The Wall Street Journal, U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, TheHill.com\n\nImage Credit: CNN Screenshot", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#0e0e0e", "p": {"domain_verify": "4e3a17d2b19ae614286124438d4e37ce"}, "description": "Sen.
