Despite gross margin for the quarter coming in at a healthy 89.6%, Supernus' net loss widened to $0.65 per share. Comparatively speaking, Wall Street was looking for a narrower loss of $0.55 per share, but Supernus crushed its revenue estimate of $7.8 million. Furthermore, Supernus issued a full-year revenue forecast of $75 million-$85 million which appears in line with the Street's consensus estimate of $82.8 million.\n\nNow what: Although Supernus missed EPS estimates by $0.10, it's pretty evident that its marketed epilepsy products, Oxtellar XR and Trokendi XR, are being well accepted by physicians. It remains to be seen what the remainder of its pipeline will hold with regard to SPN-810 and SPN-812, which are currently in midstage studies for impulsive aggression in ADHD and ADHD itself, but I suspect that Oxtellar XR and Trokendi XR alone have enough momentum to possibly make Supernus profitable on an ongoing basis perhaps as soon as the latter half of this year. With that being said, I could still see there being additional upside potential in shares of Supernus.", "article_metadata": {"publish_time": "12:58", "description": "Supernus shares rocket higher after reporting its fourth-quarter results.
