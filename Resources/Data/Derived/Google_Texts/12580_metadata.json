Charron hit a state cut in the event as the Eagles took second as a team. ( Steve Stoner / Loveland Reporter-Herald )\n\nThe way Saturday played out, Thompson Valley was just chasing ghost points Silver Creek wasn't giving up.\n\nAs Thompson Valley coach Dale Leonhart put it, the Raptors were simply \"riding their mojo\", rolling right along to the Northern Conference title, beating the Eagles by nearly 100 points, 504-409. The results were hard and true, and while Thompson Valley settled for second place, it wasn't as if the Eagles didn't build up some momentum for the 4A state meet.\n\nJack Thorne bounced back from a rough start to the weekend to lower the conference records he already owned in both the 200-yard individual medley and the 100 backstroke, earning NC swimmer of the year honors. Chris Eddy cruised to the 500 freestyle title, and the Eagles divers did what they always do, scoring points in bunches, led by the conference-title efforts of Collin Williams.\n\nThere was more. Reed Charron picked up a state cut in winning the consolation heat of the 100 butterfly (1:00.22), and the Eagles posted a number of quality swims, dropping time in 19 of their 22 races.\n\n\"We have more good cuts,\" Leonhart said. \"Lukas (Gately) with his improved IM and back, he's got choices. Reed's got two, Garret (Britt) has choices, because he has multiples. We did pretty much what we could do.\"\n\nFor Thorne, there wasn't any part of the day about redemption. His meet started Friday with his underwater kickout at the start of the 200 medley relay carrying him too far and the group being disqualified, and while he felt bad about the error, he went back over his calculations, made the proper adjustment and moved forward.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFaster than anybody in his two races, neither of which was very close. He won the 200 IM in 1:53.04, lowering his record-setting time from the day before, then came back in the 100 back with a time of 49.27, lowering his conference record from the year before. As he heads to state, he knows there's more in the tank (he's aiming for the state record in the 100 back), so he's looking forward to the challenges which await.\n\nMountain View's Aidan Pickering swims the breaststroke portion of the 200-yard individual medley during the Northern Conference Championships on Saturday. He finished fifth, then came back and took second in the 100 butterfly. (Steve Stoner / Loveland Reporter-Herald)\n\nOne of them may be Tyler Lis, the Silver Creek senior who was one of three double winners on the day (Austin Park of Estes Park was the other), and a guy Thorne might room with next year at Northwestern. They didn't swim against each other this weekend, but Thorne anticipates a showdown in the IM.\n\n\"I had a great time,\" Thorne said. \"Even though we didn't win, I still think this was one of the more fun conferences I've swam at. I swam better at this conference than the past three, and I think it sets me up really nicely for next week.\n\n\"I think (the IM) is going to be a really fun race. I'm not sure what Daniel Carr (of Cheyenne Mountain) is swimming, but I'm assuming he'll swim that. I think Daniel Graber (D'Evelyn) and Tyler Lis will also be in that with me. I think it will be a fun top heat, I think it will be quick and I think we'll all go faster than the top two guys the past three years.\"\n\nEddy's victory in the 500 freestyle came without a challenge as he posted a 4:42.70, winning by nearly 29 seconds, while teammate Liam Gately was on the opposite end, taking second twice by a combined .59 seconds in the 200 and 100 frees.\n\nWilliams also had a cushion for his title, scoring 464.30 points to finish nearly 24 ahead of Longmont's Nick Vaughn. The Eagles scored 55 points in the event, and Williams has some confidence built going into his final prep competition.\n\n\"I'm super excited,\" he said. \"I think I have a good chance of doing well down at state, maybe even winning it. Hopefully I can dive as well as I did today, or even better next weekend. I had a really strong head all the way through, and I was just really confident on the board and prelims, and that helped me execute my dives as well as I could.\"\n\nWhile the Eagles feel like they are a team on the upswing, the same emotion runs true for Mountain View, which will head into the final weekend lifted by a team atmosphere the Lions haven't experienced for a few years.\n\nMountain View added to the state roster at conference, closing out strong, and Aiden Pickering led that charge, going from seeded fifth in the 100 butterfly to a second-place finish of 56.81, his second championship swim of the day.\n\n\"It proves that all the hard work you've done, you've accomplished something that can get you second,\" Pickering said of the fly. \"It's good. I can't say I was shocked, because I knew I had to be tougher on myself and I knew I could make it.\"\n\nPickering looks at the bigger state roster and the additional firepower for the relays and says he's amped already for state. To him, it's not just a few stray individuals, but a group ready to surge together.\n\nStrait can feel that building, realizing there is more. It was frustrating for her to see her team score 186 points and finish 2 points out of fifth, knowing two of her swimmers sat with academic issues. They will return next week, and she has nothing but confidence her team is ready to seize on the momentum.\n\n\"Our relays got faster,\" she said. \"For me, that gives me that prayer of the 200 free relay getting in. For me, putting three relays up at state would be huge for these boys and a feather in their cap they're doing good things. There is that glimmer, and we know there are going to be good things next week.\"\n\nMike Brohard: 970-635-3633, mbrohard@reporter-herald.com and twitter.com/RHpreps\n\nNorthern Conference Championships\n\nAt MV Aquatic Center\n\nTeam scores \u2014 Silver Creek 504, Thompson Valley 409, Windsor 268, Estes Park 264, Longmont 188, Mountain View 186, Greeley Central 133, Valley 64, Englewood 62, Northridge 45.\n\n200 medley relay \u2014 1.
