Anyone who knows Broncos running back C.J. Anderson understands his grandmother deserved the precious gift.

Anderson is a slashing and bruising runner capable of bouncing a defensive lineman and eluding a defensive back. But thanks in large part to the way his grandmother brought him up, Anderson is also a sweetheart of a guy. He demonstrated his kindness by using some of the $150,963 playing-time bonus he received a couple days ago to buy his grandmother, Barbara Gaddies, a new Honda CRV EX. Anderson surprised her with the maroon car as she came outside her Vallejo, Calif., home with many of their family and friends looking on.

Grandma was quite excited.

“I always told her that when I got to the NFL that I was going to buy her a new car and new house,” Anderson said Saturday. “She’s done so much for me. I wouldn’t be where I am today if it wasn’t for her.”

So the house comes with the next contract?

“We’ll see,” Anderson said, laughing. “First things, first.”
