PAUL, Minn. (WCCO) \u2014 In Minnesota, at least one group opposed to Obamacare encouraged Minnesotans not to enroll and encouraged them to refuse to sign up on any website.\n\nGov. Mark Dayton calls it inexplicable.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a barrage of criticism all the way. It\u2019s been people cheering when it has problems. There are people telling people not to enroll, which is, I think, very ill-advised,\u201d Dayton said.\n\nIf you refused to get insurance, here\u2019s what happens now: you\u2019ll be fined $95 per adult and $47.50 per child or 1 percent of your income, whichever is higher.\n\nIf you make $40,000 a year, the penalty is $298. Next year, it goes up to $695 per adult or 2.5 percent of your income.\n\nYou won\u2019t go to jail, and the IRS cannot put a lien on your house or take your pay. But it can take your tax refund or reduce it.\n\nAfter its rocky rollout, even MNsure supporters did not expect the health exchange to sign up nearly 170,000 people.\n\nBut the health exchange still cannot document how many of those enrollees did not have insurance before, and how many are the young healthy people the exchanges need to be profitable.\n\nThere are some exceptions to the March 31 filing deadline. If you tried to enroll but could not get through the website for some reason, MNsure will extend the deadline. Officials said 36,000 Minnesotans fell into that category.\n\nThe next open enrollment period is in November, but you can sign up if you experience what they call \u201clife events,\u201d which include changing jobs, getting married, adopting or giving birth to a child.\n\nHere are some of the sources we used for this Reality Check:\n\nPenalty For Not Enrolling\n\nhttps://www.mnsure.org/individual-family/mandate/\n\nWebsite Urging Non-Participation In New Health Care Websites\n\nhttp://www.cchfreedom.org/cchf.php/784#.UzxPGIKd7TQ\n\nMNsure Home\n\nhttps://www.mnsure.org/\n\nCost and Coverage Implications Of The Affordable Care Act\n\nhttp://www.rand.org/health/aca/costs_coverage.html\n\nMNsure Enrollments Hit 169,521\n\nhttp://www.twincities.com/politics/ci_25467355/mnsure-enrollments-hit-169-251", "article_metadata": {"description": "In Minnesota, at least one group opposed to Obamacare encouraged Minnesotans not to enroll and encouraged them to refuse to sign up on any website.
