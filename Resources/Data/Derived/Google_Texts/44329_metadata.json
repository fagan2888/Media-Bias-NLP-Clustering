Included in that group is a rule that allows for tax-free treatment of certain \u201cqualified charitable distributions\u201d from IRAs where the distributions are donated to charity. The bill only extends this tax break until December 31, 2014.\n\n\u201cQualified Charitable Distribution\u201d\n\nSpecifically, a taxpayer may exclude from gross income the aggregate amount of his or her \u201cqualified charitable distributions\u201d that do not exceed $100,000 in a tax year. A \u201cqualified charitable distribution\u201d is any otherwise taxable distribution from an IRA that is:\n\nMade directly by the IRA trustee to a public charity (not a private foundation or donor advised fund at a public charity); and Made on or after the date on which the IRA owner has attained age 70 1/2.\n\nAn IRA owner who makes an IRA qualified charitable distribution in an amount equal to his or her required minimum distributions (\u201cRMDs\u201d) is considered to have satisfied his or her minimum distribution requirement for that year, even though a charitable entity (and not the IRA owner) receives the distribution.\n\nThe rule may be applied to IRA distributions made after December 31, 2013 and until December 31, 2014.\n\nShort Window of Opportunity\n\nTaxpayers must contact IRA administrators as soon as possible if they intend to take advantage of the tax-free distribution by year-end. IRA administrators may require several weeks to process rollovers.\n\nIt is currently unclear whether Congress will extend this provision to 2015 or beyond. If recent history is a reliable indicator, however, it is likely that a decision on that may not come until well into the next year.", "article_metadata": {"description": "As a part of the so-called \u201cCromnibus\u201d bill, Congress has extended dozens of expired \u201ctemporary\u201d tax breaks for 2014.
