On the cusp of the Democratic nomination, Hillary Clinton is turning all her attention to the general election and warning voters about Donald Trump in a new social media ad.

The ad is featured on Twitter, Facebook and instagram. The Clinton campaign's research arm The Briefing puts Trump's most controversial policies on display for voters all while reminding them of Trump's pledge "Everything I say I'm going to do, folks."

The Clinton campaign highlights policies such as Trump's plan to get rid of gun free school zones his first day in office, defund Planned Parenthood, repeal Obamacare, start a "deportation force" and to "go further than waterboarding" when interrogating terrorists, among others.

"These are his promises," the ad then read. "This would be his presidency. Stand together to stop Donald Trump."
