But it seems like more have been cropping up lately. Alissa Nutting\u2019s novel Tampa, published in July, is about a 26-year-old woman who builds her entire life as a teacher around her attraction to 14-year-old boys. The Lifeguard, which opened in theaters last weekend, stars Kristen Bell as a 29-year-old who returns to her hometown and has an affair with a teenager. And this week sees the theatrical release of Adore, starring Robin Wright and Naomi Watts as two best friends who fall for each other\u2019s 18-year-old sons, and A Teacher, the story of a young woman\u2019s undoing as her relationship with one of her high-school students comes to an end. While these works vary from one another greatly, taken together they show how society tends to treat these kinds of relationships: as not all that big a deal.\n\nRelated Story The To Do List's Radically Practical Message About Virginity The differing attitudes towards woman/boy relationships versus man/girl ones was, until recently, codified by the government. It wasn\u2019t until the year 2000 that all 50 states had gender-neutral statutory rape laws. Until then, laws tended to punish the woman participant less harshly or not at all, even if she was the perpetrator. According to Carolyn E. Cocca, the author of Jailbait: The Politics of Statutory Rape Laws in the United States, the role of women sex offenders is routinely downplayed. In a 2002 article in which she reviews the language used to describe statutory rapists Mary Kay LeTourneau, Stephen Simmons, and Sean O'Neill, Cocca found that: \u2026while much of the discourse still categorizes statutory rape with a male victim as abuse, the \"older woman\" perpetrator is more often described as a manipulative or mentally ill seductress while the \"older man\" perpetrator is usually likened to an abusive predator. [\u2026] Such language maintains the boundaries of traditional gender roles: the older woman is constructed as an almost sympathetic aberration of her gender who tries to obtain love by seducing a young male, while the older man is seen simply as a sexual aggressor and is therefore more universally excoriated for his behavior. This attitude also seeps into pop culture and its depictions of statutory rape. In the latest season of AMC\u2019s Mad Men, a teenage Don Draper loses his virginity to an older woman\u2014and, as Abigail Rine noted in The Atlantic, totally against his will. \u201cTo my surprise and dismay, I found that the vast majority of responses (including The Atlantic\u2019s) glossed over the encounter, benignly describing Dick as \u2018losing his virginity\u2019 or having his virginity \u2018taken\u2019 by Aimee,\u201d Rine wrote. Just as in Mad Men, The Lifeguard skips over issues of consent and instead indulges stereotypes about male libido. In the film, Leigh London (Kristen Bell) is going on 30 when she realizes her life as a journalist in New York isn\u2019t what she wanted. She moves back in with her parents in Connecticut, where she works as a lifeguard and begins a relationship with 16-year-old Jason (David Lambert). The film depicts their affair as being virtually free of negative consequences or any kind of lasting damage. Though their relationship is found out\u2014by Mel, Leigh\u2019s friend and assistant principal of Jason\u2019s high school\u2014Jason and his father \u201crefuse to name names\u201d to the school, and charges can\u2019t be pressed against Leigh. Jason\u2019s father is thoroughly unbothered by the whole ordeal. \u201cLook, Jas has been through enough in his life already. Real problems, you get me?\u201d he tells Mel. \u201cThis thing with the lifeguard\u2026 things happen. You keep moving or die, you understand?\u201d He doesn\u2019t get why Mel apologizes for not realizing the affair was happening\u2014\u201cSorry for what? That my son got laid?\u201d At the end of the film, Leigh returns to New York, intent on covering education for the New York Times, her time with Jason and his friend having seemingly solved her mid-life crisis.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Lifeguard, Adore, and A Teacher treat the women who commit or nearly commit statutory rape as less threatening than their male counterparts.", "author": "Jordan Larson", "og": {"site_name": "The Atlantic", "description": "The Lifeguard, Adore, and A Teacher treat the women who commit or nearly commit statutory rape as less threatening than their male counterparts.", "title": "Woman/Boy Relationships in Pop Culture: No Big Deal", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2013/09/kristenbell-thelifeguardjpg/lead_large.jpg", "url": "http://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2013/09/woman-boy-relationships-in-pop-culture-no-big-deal/279408/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "theatlantic.com", "site": "@theatlantic", "card": "summary"}, "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "p": {"domain_verify": "68e1a0361a557708fefc992f3309ed70"}, "fb": {"admins": "577048155,17301937", "page_id": 29259828486, "app_id": 100770816677686}, "keywords": "The Atlantic, The Atlantic Magazine, TheAtlantic.com, Atlantic, news, opinion, breaking news, analysis, commentary, business, politics, culture, international, science, technology, national and life", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, width=device-width, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd4e6\"", "article_summary": "This attitude also seeps into pop culture and its depictions of statutory rape.\nScreen Media Films Portrayals of relationships between older women and younger men have showed up in pop culture time and again, from The Graduate to American Pie.\nIt wasn\u2019t until the year 2000 that all 50 states had gender-neutral statutory rape laws.\nAccording to Carolyn E.
