And that even applied to the second- and third-team units.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s never where you want it to be as a head coach,\u201d MacIntyre said, \u201cbut our tempo has improved. I think we understand our offense better. I like the progress we\u2019re making in that area.\n\n\u201cWhen we want to go fast, we\u2019re going faster than we did last year.\u201d\n\nReporters were not made privy to statistics from the scrimmage in Folsom Field \u2014 the final session of August camp that was open to spectators.\n\nBut are a few observations:\n\n* Sophomore running back Michael Adkins II was in the opening lineup with the first-team offense ahead of junior Christian Powell. Along with redshirt-freshman running back Phillip Lindsay and senior Tony Jones, the Buffs have good depth at running back. In red-zone work, Lindsay (5-foot-8, 175 pounds) flashed his speed and scored two touchdowns to the outside.\n\n* True freshman wide receiver Shay Fields was in the opening lineup and ran several deep patterns \u2014 including the first play of the scrimmage. He appears to be living up to his status as CU\u2019s only four-star signee in February. Fields also had a long punt return called back because of a penalty.\n\n* The first-team offense, directed by quarterback Sefo Liufau, drove for touchdowns on its first two possessions.\n\n* Two freshmen opened with the No. 1 defense: ends Christian Shaver and Michael Mathewes. MacIntyre said injuries that prevented Tyler Henington and Derek McCartney from participating were a reason that Shaver and Mathewes got the nods. But it certainly is a good sign for the two first-year players.\n\n* Highlights for the defense included an interception by true freshman safety Evan White of a pass by second-team quarterback Jordan Gehrke, and a forced fumble by junior cornerback Ken Crawley on a hit against Jones.\n\n* On a negative note, MacIntyre confirmed following the scrimmage that senior safety Jered Bell, a returning starter, had suffered a torn an ACL during the Friday evening practice and is lost for the year. Bell sat out the 2011 season with an ACL tear in his other knee.\n\n\u201cIt was a sad night for me, really sad,\u201d MacIntyre said.\n\nIn the scrimmage, senior Terrel Smith worked in place of Bell with the No. 1 defense. Smith redshirted last fall with shoulder surgery.\n\nTom Kensler: tkensler@denverpost.com or twitter.com/tomkensler", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Colorado\u2019s Saturday scrimmage reveals improved offensive tempo", "title": "Colorado\u2019s Saturday scrimmage reveals improved offensive tempo", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/08/16/colorados-saturday-scrimmage-reveals-improved-offensive-tempo/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140816__CUFootball648p1.jpg", "height": 509}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140816__CUFootball648p1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-08-16T15:00:09+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T08:59:41+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca05c\"", "article_summary": "In the scrimmage, senior Terrel Smith worked in place of Bell with the No.\n\u201cIt\u2019s never where you want it to be as a head coach,\u201d MacIntyre said, \u201cbut our tempo has improved.\nBOULDER \u2014 Following a two-hour scrimmage, Colorado football coach Mike MacIntyre said Saturday he is pleased with the progress made by the offense relative to its tempo.\nAlong with redshirt-freshman running back Phillip Lindsay and senior Tony Jones, the Buffs have good depth at running back.\n* True freshman wide receiver Shay Fields was in the opening lineup and ran several deep patterns \u2014 including the first play of the scrimmage."}
