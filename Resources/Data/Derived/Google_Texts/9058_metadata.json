Employee volunteers donate to the supply drive throughout the month of August.\n\n\u201cOur employees at CNB are an integral part of the communities they live and work in. They know firsthand just how invaluable this kind of assistance and volunteerism can be to a young student in the local school system,\u201d said Cherokee Nation Principal Chief Bill John Baker. \u201cThat\u2019s why it is so important to be involved in this way. Every additional opportunity we can offer a child means they have a better shot at academic success today and lifelong success for years to come.\u201d\n\nThis year, employee volunteers donated more than 3,500 items, including basic learning tools, backpacks and classroom necessities, to schools located throughout the tribe\u2019s 14-county jurisdiction.\n\n\u201cWe would like to thank CNB for donating school supplies to our students,\u201d said Carolyn Robbins, principal at Peggs School. \u201cOur students will put the supplies to use by making wonderful art displays, maps for geography, essays for English class and many other educational projects.\u201d\n\nFifteen Cherokee Nation properties designated a receiving school and participated in this year\u2019s school supply drive. Participating properties included CNB locations in Catoosa, Tulsa, Jay, Tahlequah, Pryor, Stilwell and Woodmark. Participating CNE properties included Hard Rock Hotel & Casino Tulsa, Cherokee Casino Ramona, Cherokee Casino Fort Gibson, Cherokee Casino Roland, Cherokee Casino Sallisaw, Cherokee Casino Tahlequah and Cherokee Casino & Hotel West Siloam Springs.\n\nThe annual school supply drives are coordinated through the tribe\u2019s Community Impact Team, a group of tribal employees dedicated to volunteering, engaging and supporting local communities.\n\n\u201cWe volunteer and donate as much as possible to our local community throughout the year,\u201d said Becky Welch, accounting associate and employee volunteer at Cherokee Nation Businesses. \u201cThe school supply drives are especially rewarding because of the joy they bring the students and staff at schools that might not otherwise have all the supplies they need.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "TAHLEQUAH, Oklahoma\u2014Employee volunteers from Cherokee Nation Businesses and Cherokee Nation Entertainment are continuing an annual tradition of supporting local students bCherokee business employee volunteers donate much-needed school supplies to support students.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.creator": "theresa", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/10/10/cherokee-nation-companies-continue-support-local-schools-157292", "type": "article", "image": "http://d1jrw5jterzxwu.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/article_media/cherokee_school_donations-cherokee_nation.jpg", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "title": "Cherokee Nation Companies Continue Support of Local Schools"}, "dcterms.date": "2014-10-10T15:30-04:00", "dc": {"title": "Cherokee Nation Companies Continue Support of Local Schools"}, "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/10/10/cherokee-nation-companies-continue-support-local-schools-157292", "robots": "follow, index", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Cherokee Nation, Philanthropy, Native Americans in Philanthropy, American Indian Education", "validation_code": "d9d37d7b776cc351c4025ded3df21cad", "sioc": {"num_replies": 0}, "dcterms.title": "Cherokee Nation Companies Continue Support of Local Schools"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9b12\"", "article_summary": "Participating CNE properties included Hard Rock Hotel & Casino Tulsa, Cherokee Casino Ramona, Cherokee Casino Fort Gibson, Cherokee Casino Roland, Cherokee Casino Sallisaw, Cherokee Casino Tahlequah and Cherokee Casino & Hotel West Siloam Springs.\nTAHLEQUAH, Oklahoma\u2014Employee volunteers from Cherokee Nation Businesses and Cherokee Nation Entertainment are continuing an annual tradition of supporting local students by donating and delivering supplies to classrooms in need.\n\u201cWe volunteer and donate as much as possible to our local community throughout the year,\u201d said Becky Welch, accounting associate and employee volunteer at Cherokee Nation Businesses.\nThey know firsthand just how invaluable this kind of assistance and volunteerism can be to a young student in the local school system,\u201d said Cherokee Nation Principal Chief Bill John Baker.\n\u201cWe would like to thank CNB for donating school supplies to our students,\u201d said Carolyn Robbins, principal at Peggs School."}
