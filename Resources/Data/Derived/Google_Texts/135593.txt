The first week of school went horribly wrong for one Florida teen this week when she wore a skirt that didn’t meet the standards of the high school’s dress code.

As punishment for wearing a skirt that fell more than three inches above her knee, 15-year-old Miranda Larkin was forced to change into bright red sweatpants and a yellow shirt emblazoned with the words “DRESS CODE VIOLATION,” reports USA Today.

It was the third day of school at Oak Leaf High School in Orange Park, Florida, for the teenager who had recently moved to the district.

Larkin’s mother called the outfit a “shame suit” and said it caused her daughter to cry and break out in hives. “I feel that by putting a kid in an outfit that says what they did wrong across their chest and down their leg is taking their private records and making them public, and that’s a clear violation of privacy rights,” she told USA Today.

A school representative told the publication that students who violate the dress code are given three options: an in-school suspension, the T-shirt and sweatpants, or having someone bring them a change of clothes. Larkin said she was not given any other options.

Strict punishments for dress codes and other minor rule infringements have become more common as schools increasingly implement zero tolerance policies on things like guns and sexual harassment.
