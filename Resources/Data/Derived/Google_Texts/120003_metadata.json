Much of the deal flow in the sector has been based around consolidation, which often allows for cost cuts.\n\nDeclining revenue has led to a smaller number of stand-alone players, said Mr. Phillips. \u201cThere are outliers, like The Economist, that got sold for an off-the-charts price, but more often it\u2019s a consolidation deal,\u201d he added.\n\nNew York-based TV Guide struggled for years before OpenGate purchased it. Once a publication seen on the coffee tables of many American homes, TV Guide in recent years faced declining print advertising, according to the OpenGate release announcing the sale. TV Guide saw its circulation drop to 3.3 million by 2007 from its 1975 peak of 19.7 million, according to a 2008 story in LBO Wire.\n\nMacrovision Solutions Corp. paid $2.8 billion for Gemstar-TV Guide International Inc. in early 2008, which included the TV Guide publication and its namesake cable channel, TV Guide channel (later sold and rebranded as the Pop). Macrovision quickly decided to sell the TV Guide magazine division and OpenGate bought TV Guide magazine later that year for a payment of $1 and the assumption of $50 million in liabilities. As part of the deal, Macrovision also agreed to loan OpenGate $9.5 million at 3% interest.\n\n\u201cWhen we acquired the business in 2008, it was losing a lot of money and the previous owners weren\u2019t putting a lot of faith in the future of it,\u201d said OpenGate\u2019s Mr. Lezec. \u201cLiterally, within the first year of OpenGate\u2019s ownership, we took it from making a significant loss to being profitable, and repositioned it to be more relevant.\u201d\n\nThe firm changed the magazine\u2019s editorial content, helped revitalize the brand and its digital direction, and enacted a series of cost-cutting measures that included outsourcing both production and circulation management, and reducing head count, said Mr. Lezec.\n\nOpenGate\u2019s turnaround of TV Guide hit one bump early on in the firm\u2019s ownership. Less than a year after the acquisition, TV Guide\u2019s president and chief executive at the time, Scott Crystal, resigned, accusing OpenGate of draining the company\u2019s cash flow, in part for charging fees for its consulting and advisory services, according to media reports at the time. OpenGate said at the time that Mr. Crystal\u2019s accusations were \u201cboth inaccurate and unfortunate.\u201d\n\nAs of spring 2015, TV Guide magazine registered a total audience of 12.4 million per issue, according to demographic statistics provided on the publication\u2019s website. Its audience had a median age of nearly 49 years and was 58% female, according to TV Guide.\n\nLast year, TV Guide changed its leadership, with Chief Operating Officer David J. Fishman appointed chief executive after Jack Kilger resigned from the post.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re very positive about this deal. We had a great run with OpenGate and now have a longer vision with NTVB,\u201d said Mr. Fishman.\n\nThere are many complimentary business areas between NTVB and TV Guide that will enable them to work together in \u201ca collaborative way,\u201d said Mr. Fishman. NTVB publishes other TV entertainment and listings magazines such as TV Weekly, Channel Guide Magazine and View! Magazine. \u201cOur goal is to move TV ratings,\u201d Mr. Fishman added.\n\nHowever, Mr. Fishman said there weren\u2019t any plans to further cut costs. \u201cThe [chief executive] of NTVB [Andrew DeAngelis] isn\u2019t trying to do a private equity cost-cutting strategy,\u201d said Mr. Fishman. \u201cWe\u2019re not looking to cut our way to growth.\u201d\n\nOpenGate was founded in 2005 by former Platinum Equity executive Andrew Nikou. After a decade of investing its founders\u2019 capital, OpenGate came to market earlier this year to raise its first institutional fund, with an offering amount of $300 million, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nWrite to Lillian at Lillian.Rizzo@wsj.com.
