McCarty has also established a relationship between local tribal governments and the college\u2019s newly formed Center for Sustainable Infrastructure to improve tribal water systems.\n\nSome 4.5 percent of current Evergreen students are Native American. Evergreen hosts the Longhouse Education and Cultural Center, the first Native longhouse built on a public college campus in the U.S. The college also offers a master of public administration degree with a concentration on tribal governance, a program of study on Native American and world Indigenous Peoples, and sponsors a reservation-based program where classes are offered locally and the study topics are determined in partnership with tribal authorities.\n\nMcCarty previously served on the National Ocean Council Governance Coordination Committee and former Governor Christine Gregoire\u2019s blue ribbon panel on ocean acidification. He is also focused on what Native communities have to offer Evergreen.\n\n\u201cTribal governments are great educational resources, because of their growing diversity in expertise. It only seems logical that we find more ways to work together for the advancement of education as a whole,\u201d said McCarty. \u201cLong-term tribal leadership is based on interdisciplinary experience and creative thinking\u2014both of which are great Evergreen attributes,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Evergreen State College has named former Makah tribal chairman to the new post of Special Assistant to the President for Tribal Government Relations.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.creator": "leeanne", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/01/25/evergreen-state-college-creates-new-position-tribal-relations-153240", "type": "article", "image": "http://d1jrw5jterzxwu.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/article_media/micah-mccarty.jpg", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "title": "The Evergreen State College Creates New Position for Tribal Relations"}, "dcterms.date": "2014-01-25T15:00-05:00", "dc": {"title": "The Evergreen State College Creates New Position for Tribal Relations"}, "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/01/25/evergreen-state-college-creates-new-position-tribal-relations-153240", "robots": "follow, index", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Evergreen State College, Native American Education", "validation_code": "d9d37d7b776cc351c4025ded3df21cad", "sioc": {"num_replies": 0}, "dcterms.title": "The Evergreen State College Creates New Position for Tribal Relations"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb81f\"", "article_summary": "\u201cLong-term tribal leadership is based on interdisciplinary experience and creative thinking\u2014both of which are great Evergreen attributes,\u201d he said.\nMcCarty has also established a relationship between local tribal governments and the college\u2019s newly formed Center for Sustainable Infrastructure to improve tribal water systems.\nWith the goal of deepening and expanding relationships with tribal governments in the Pacific Northwest, The Evergreen State College in Olympia, Washington has named former Makah tribal chairman Micah McCarty to the new post of Special Assistant to the President for Tribal Government Relations.\n\u201cTribal governments are great educational resources, because of their growing diversity in expertise.\nEvergreen hosts the Longhouse Education and Cultural Center, the first Native longhouse built on a public college campus in the U.S."}
