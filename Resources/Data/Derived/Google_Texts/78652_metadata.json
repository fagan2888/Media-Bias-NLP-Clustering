Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, hopes to silence these critics with his new office as president pro tempore.\n\nHatch told The Daily Signal that he\u2019s frustrated the \u201cfoundations of the Senate\u2019s unique character\u201d have been sacrificed \u201cin an attempt to score political points\u201d during the last session. As president pro tempore, he intends \u201cto be active in helping restore the Senate as a deliberative and legislative body.\u201d\n\nA constitutionally mandated office with a classically inspired title, the president pro tempore serves as the presiding officer of the Senate \u201cfor the time being\u201d during the vice president\u2019s absence.\n\nThus, for the 114th Congress, Vice President Joe Biden technically will remain the Senate\u2019s president, and Hatch will serve as president pro tempore.\n\nMore than a symbolic title, the president pro tempore does wield power. By law, the officer presides over the Senate and stands third in line for presidential succession. By tradition, he serves as the elder statesman of the entire legislative body.\n\nA past president pro tempore, Sen. Robert C. Byrd, D-W.V., best described the position as the highest Senate honor \u201cbestowed upon a colorful and significant group of senators during the past two centuries\u2014men who stamped their imprint on the office and on their times.\u201d\n\nSince the first Senate quorum in Philadelphia to the most recent session in Washington, D.C., the president pro tempore has exerted significant influence.\n\nMost notably during the rogue vice presidency of John C. Calhoun, the Senate employed the office to hold back executive encroachment.\n\nOn the eve of the nullification crisis, Calhoun began appointing Senate committee chairman hostile to the current administration. Together, President John Quincy Adams and Sen. Henry Clay wrested appointment power from Calhoun to place it in the hands of the president pro tempore.\n\nCommittee appointments have since become the prerogative of Senate caucuses. However, the president pro tempore has played an important role in safeguarding the constitutional separation of powers.\n\nThe most senior member of the new majority, Hatch assumed the historic position on Tuesday afternoon. At 80 years old, Hatch is the oldest Republican in the Senate.\n\nHe succeeded former president pro tempore, Sen. Pat Leahy, D-Vt. Hatch also will serve as chairman of the Senate Finance Committee.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The president pro tempore does wield power.
