The union of nearly 300,000 has been critical of the health law before.\n\nThe report says it\u2019s \u201cironic\u201d that the Obama administration is publicly discussing income inequality though it has yet to make the changes to ObamaCare that Unite Here believes are necessary to avoid exacerbating income disparity.\n\n\u201cHaving already made efforts to accommodate businesses, churches and congressional staff, it is ironic that the administration is now highlighting issues of economic inequality without acting to preserve health plans that have been achieving the goals of the ACA for decades,\u201d the report concludes. \u201cWithout a smart fix, the ACA will heighten the inequality that the Administration seeks to reduce \u2026 We cannot sit idly by as the politicians carve up our health plans while they carve out exceptions for themselves and every special interest feeding at the trough in Washington.\u201d\n\nThe report comes about three weeks before the enrollment deadline for ObamaCare. While officials say 4 million have signed up for private insurance on the exchanges so far, the program is still short of its unofficial 7 million goal.\n\nClick here to read more from Ralston Reports.", "article_metadata": {"classification": "/FOX NEWS/POLITICS/REGULATION/Health Care", "dcterms.modified": "2015-01-30 08:56:35 EST", "dcterms.abstract": "A new report from a major U.S. union says ObamaCare will hasten income inequality.", "twitter": {"description": "A new report from a major U.S. union says ObamaCare will hasten income inequality.", "creator": "@foxnews", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2014/03/10/obamacare-will-hasten-income-inequality-union-report-says.html", "image": "http://a57.foxnews.com/media2.foxnews.com/thumbnails/i/030814/0/0/030814_CB_Obamacare_640.jpg?ve=1", "title": "ObamaCare will hasten income inequality, union report says", "site": "@foxnews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "dc.format": "text/html", "dc.publisher": "Fox News", "parsely-metadata": "{\"tags\":[\"/FOX NEWS/POLITICS/REGULATION/Health Care\"],\"author\":\"\",\"subSection\":\"politics\",\"title\":\"ObamaCare will hasten income inequality, union report says\",\"image_url\":\"http://a57.foxnews.com/media2.foxnews.com/thumbnails/i/030814/0/0/030814_CB_Obamacare_640.jpg?ve=1\",\"pub_date\":\"2014-03-10T09:00:22Z\",\"link\":\"http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2014/03/10/obamacare-will-hasten-income-inequality-union-report-says.html\",\"type\":\"article\",\"identifier\":\"fb60d21e-19cb-44c7-be65-6fd2ecc42baf\",\"section\":\"politics\"}", "prism.aggregationType": "subsection", "prism.channel": "fnc", "dc.description": "A new report from a major U.S. union says ObamaCare will hasten income inequality.", "dc.identifier": "fb60d21e-19cb-44c7-be65-6fd2ecc42baf", "dc.language": "en-US", "pagetype": "article", "classification-isa": "healthc", "description": "A new report from a major U.S. union says ObamaCare will hasten income inequality.", "prism.section": "politics", "fb": {"app_id": 113186182048399}, "dc.source": "FoxNews.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "dc.title": "Obamacare Will Hasten Income Inequality, Union Report Says", "dcterms.created": "2015-01-30 08:56:35 EST", "og": {"site_name": "Fox News", "description": "A new report from a major U.S. union says ObamaCare will hasten income inequality.", "title": "ObamaCare will hasten income inequality, union report says | Fox News", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2014/03/10/obamacare-will-hasten-income-inequality-union-report-says.html", "image": "http://a57.foxnews.com/media2.foxnews.com/thumbnails/i/030814/0/0/030814_CB_Obamacare_640.jpg?ve=1", "type": "article"}, "dc.type": "Text.Article", "dc.date": "2014-03-10", "parsely-page": "{\"tags\":[\"/FOX NEWS/POLITICS/REGULATION/Health Care\"],\"author\":\"\",\"subSection\":\"politics\",\"title\":\"ObamaCare will hasten income inequality, union report says\",\"image_url\":\"http://a57.foxnews.com/media2.foxnews.com/thumbnails/i/030814/0/0/030814_CB_Obamacare_640.jpg?ve=1\",\"pub_date\":\"2014-03-10T09:00:22Z\",\"link\":\"http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2014/03/10/obamacare-will-hasten-income-inequality-union-report-says.html\",\"post_id\":\"fb60d21e-19cb-44c7-be65-6fd2ecc42baf\",\"type\":\"article\",\"section\":\"politics\"}"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb7d9\"", "article_summary": "A new report from a major U.S. union says ObamaCare will hasten income inequality.\nThe report says it\u2019s \u201cironic\u201d that the Obama administration is publicly discussing income inequality though it has yet to make the changes to ObamaCare that Unite Here believes are necessary to avoid exacerbating income disparity.\n\u201cThe promise of Obamacare was the right one and the hope for extending healthcare coverage to the un-and under-insured a step in the right direction,\u201d the report says.\nThe union of nearly 300,000 has been critical of the health law before.\n\u201cYet the unintended consequences will hit the average, hard-working American where it hurts: in the wallet.\u201dThe document was put out by Unite Here, a hospitality industry union representing workers in the U.S. and Canada."}
