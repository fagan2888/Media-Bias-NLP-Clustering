There\u2019s the horror of Trayvon Martin and Michael Brown; Sandy Hook and Isla Vista; Syria, Iraq, Gaza and that whole extended neighborhood where the numbers don\u2019t even seem to represent actual humans because we can\u2019t put memorable faces on them.\n\nWe are right smack in the middle of yet another in a seemingly endless, almost ritualistic, episode of the American documentary series, \u201cA Nation in Mourning.\u201d Now, if we allow ourselves to focus for a moment on what lies ahead, we have to realize that we will soon be seeing (over and over) even more tragedy, perhaps another death caught on tape. We know it will happen and that the news media will be there to gobble it up for hours, days at a time between airline crashes and Arab Springs. As memory of us dims, this is what the 22nd century will remember, however selectively it remembers us.\n\nWho are we? Where are we as a civilization? It is not meaningless to pose such open-ended questions. More and more victims of violence in the world are surrendering their lives without being touched or even seen by their destroyers. It is not just the drone operators who commit to missions from thousands of miles distant \u2013 all of us have come to accept the impersonal as normal. Because there is just too much to process.\n\nEven in \u201csimpler times,\u201d Americans were drawn to sensation. In late December 1799, on the eve of a new century and on the heels of the cataclysmic death of George Washington, symbolic public funerals for the national father were taking place across the young United States when the body of missing teen Gulielma Sands was discovered at the bottom of a well in downtown Manhattan. The news went viral. Was it suicide or was it murder? In a tasteless, publicity-generating move, the victim\u2019s relatives put the disheveled corpse of the beautiful Quaker good-girl on display outside the Greenwich Street boarding house where she had lived. Concerned citizens \u2013 and gawkers \u2013 filed past.\n\nAttention soon focused on clean-cut Levi Weeks, another lodger there, who was the last to see her alive. The victim had stepped into his horse-drawn sleigh, and rode off with him into the night. Weeks was politically connected through his brother Ezra, a major builder in the city, who hired a dream team of attorneys that featured as co-counsel the brilliant pair of Alexander Hamilton and Aaron Burr. Newspapers covered the sensational trial, and hot-off-the-press pamphlets published the sordid details of witness testimony. Poets wrote odes to the lamented girl. Did he do it because she was pregnant? People remained divided on Levi\u2019s guilt or innocence, even after the dream team got him acquitted by pointing the finger at another suspect, a lower-class man with the dark and sinister name of Croucher.\n\nThe antecedents of Anna Nicole Smith are present in the Manhattan well mystery, if not hints of O.J. Simpson, too. Historical examples abound in U.S. history of mysterious disappearances and grisly unsolved crimes, many of them connected to racial and sexual violence. We still remember the way life ended for General George Armstrong Custer, and the parents of Lizzie Borden, and the London prostitutes who met up with Jack the Ripper. We go back to make sordid sense of the persistence of lynching in the last decades of the 19th and first decades of the 20th century. We know the stories of the Alamo, Jesse James, John Dillinger, Bonnie and Clyde, Pearl Harbor, Hiroshima. The Lindbergh baby kidnapping. Patty Hearst. In terms of media coverage, Emmett Till and Trayvon Martin are close cousins. Newspapers covered all of the foregoing with predictable panache and dramatic headlines.\n\nBut something feels different these days, and America can\u2019t quite put its finger on it. It\u2019s big. It has \u201cnew era\u201d written all over it. Future historians will tell us what it was; but right now all we can do is start to speculate.\n\nWe are in the midst of a crisis of faith, which is to say, we don\u2019t know where to put our faith anymore. If access to the best medical care couldn\u2019t save Phil Hoffman or Robin Williams, and if America\u2019s extraordinary air power and omnipresent spy satellites can\u2019t make us any safer, and if our African-American president has only served (through no fault of his own) to aggravate race relations, how do we, as a society, cope?\n\nThe failure in empathy is concerning, too. What is the reaction to Spanish-speaking children who cross the border? They are not seen as tragic figures in a larger drama, or as a challenge to the humane principles Americans have traditionally claimed as that which made them an \u201cexceptional\u201d people. Reality is only as potent as the energy we can muster to pay attention to it. \u201cThe News\u201d tells us when to move on and forget. We are seeing more \u201creality\u201d these days in television programming that makes stars out of the mediocre \u2013 Kardashians, \u201cDuck Dynasty\u201d \u2013 where \u201creal life situations\u201d are manufactured. The passive viewer finds meaning in mediocrity while thinking in shallow ways about the world-transformative.\n\nHuman crises that we should feel deeply about \u2013 poverty and hunger, gun violence, abuse of females \u2013 ought to register a power over the mind, but these are made to seem intractable, remote from us; they draw us in less effectively than programmed entertainment does. Despite the first, bold attempt of youth to organize in Egypt and overthrow a corrupt regime, the Internet has generally not succeeded in supporting positive democratic activism. More routinely, it enforces passivity.\n\nCan\u2019t we do something to reverse what\u2019s happening? The answer is far from obvious. Having the power (literally in our hands) to communicate globally \u2013 instantaneously \u2013 has ironically led to the individual becoming less influential and more anonymous. The World Wide Web has not liberated us; it has colonized us. Over the course of one political generation, the average American\u2019s capacity to register his/her reality has been compromised; inner life is being transformed along with our tastes.\n\nSo, are we really suggesting that our individuality is at risk when we log on? \u201cThe network\u201d joins us not to sentient beings we actually recognize but to innumerable faceless others whose alphanumeric identities are ripples of neurons impressed into interactive service with a commercializing, homogenizing power that exhibits no human virtues. The commercial Web is abusive: tactless, heartless, amoral. It obliges us to learn the syntax that virtualizes us.\n\nInnovation nowadays occurs primarily at the \u201cmicro\u201d level. As a culture, we bow to unseen forces as never before, and as individuals we suffer degradation when we fail to imagine a face-to-face solution to day-to-day issues. As we become too quickly sated by digitized eye candy, human intensity suffers. On some fundamental level that we can only imperfectly make sense of, and which future historians may grapple with, nearness to others doesn\u2019t happen quite the way it used to.", "article_metadata": {"description": "We live in a new era -- a crisis of faith.
