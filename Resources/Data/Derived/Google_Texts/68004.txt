What stood out to you about U.S. politics in 2014, and how has that influenced what you’ll be following closely this year?

It was striking to me that several major events President Obama responded to in 2014 were quite unpredictable, such as the Ebola outbreak, the rise of ISIS, the Russia-Ukraine situation, and the events of Ferguson, Missouri. So when you look back on it, it’s interesting to consider to what degree these were driven by external or random events, and whether there was a way to predict them. In particular, one of the advantages of using social media is that you have a tap into ground-level events. In my research, I observe discussions of politics on Twitter, particularly around and leading up to elections. More broadly, social media offers a window into how social movements form around political campaigns and, in recent months, in response to the events in Ferguson and New York City. Long term, I want to look at how the action crystallizes on the street via social media and how that action can be predicted.

In my research examining public opinion, another area I’ve been looking at closely is polarization and how “political sorting,” meaning how people choose where they stand on multiple issues, is intensifying. We can measure this via social media. Most people think polarization is a bad thing and leads to gridlock in Washington. But it’s also a sign that people are becoming more informed about politics. This year I’m looking forward to examining this issue further and exploring if there is in fact an upside to political polarization.
