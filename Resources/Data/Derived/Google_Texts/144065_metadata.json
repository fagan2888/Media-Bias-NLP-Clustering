What I do have the power to do is to say, \u2018You won\u2019t enroll me in this lie. You won\u2019t make me a part of it.\u2019\u201d\n\nMr. Coates said he had been waiting 15 years for this moment.\n\n\u201cWhen Prince Jones died, there were no cameras,\u201d he said. \u201cNobody was looking.\u201d\n\nSpiegel & Grau moved up the publication date of \u201cBetween the World and Me\u201d \u2013 releasing it in July, rather than September \u2013 in response to the killing of nine black churchgoers in Charleston, S.C., allegedly by a white supremacist, and the subsequent debate over the Confederate battle flag.\n\nThe book, written as a letter to his 15-year-old son Samori, discusses America\u2019s history of racial violence, and explores what it is like to inhabit a black body in this country.\n\nToni Morrison has called it \u201crequired reading,\u201d saying it has filled \u201cthe intellectual void that plagued me after James Baldwin died.\u201d It was an instant bestseller.\n\nRelated Link: Betting Big on Literary Newcomers\n\nThe National Book Award, presented by the National Book Foundation, is one of the most prestigious literary prizes in the U.S. The prizes were announced at a dinner in Manhattan.\n\nAlthough the fiction category didn\u2019t have a front runner as clear as Mr. Coates had been in the nonfiction category, buzz had been building for Ms. Groff\u2019s novel, which tells the story of a marriage from the husband\u2019s side, then the wife\u2019s. Others thought to be contenders included Hanya Yanagihara\u2019s \u201cA Little Life\u201d and Angela Flournoy\u2019s \u201cThe Turner House.\u201d\n\nMr. Johnson, in a brief acceptance speech, expressed surprise at the selection of his short-story collection, \u201cFortune Smiles.\u201d He pulled notes from his tuxedo jacket pocket in which he had jotted down his impressions as he read the other finalists\u2019 books.\n\n\u201cTranscendent,\u201d he said, reading them aloud. \u201cFunny. Searing. Essential. Human.\u201d\n\nMr. Shusterman\u2019s \u201cChallenger Deep\u201d is named after the deepest point on Earth: Challenger Deep, the southern part of the Marianas Trench.\n\nIn perhaps the most moving moment of the evening, Mr. Shusterman described how his son Brendan, as a teenager, \u201cfor a very brief time fell off a cliff,\u201d experiencing paranoia and delusions. He said his son told him: \u201cSometimes, it feels like I\u2019m at the bottom of the ocean screaming at the bottom of my lungs and no one can here me.\u201d\n\nMr. Shusterman, his voice cracking, then invited his son on stage and embraced him.\n\nThis post has been updated.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "Impassioned speeches highlighted the annual ceremony in Manhattan.", "title": "Ta-Nehisi Coates Wins National Book Award for Nonfiction", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2015/11/18/national-book-award-winners/", "image": {"src": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-LI741_coates_P_20151118225810.jpg"}, "site": "WSJspeakeasy", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Arts", "article.headline": "Ta-Nehisi Coates Wins National Book Award for Nonfiction", "description": "Impassioned speeches highlighted the annual ceremony in Manhattan.", "article_section": "Arts", "author": "Jennifer Maloney", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "Speakeasy Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "Speakeasy", "article.summary": "Impassioned speeches highlighted the annual ceremony in Manhattan.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2015-11-19T04:08:36-05:00", "dj.asn": "10-143", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2015/11/18/national-book-award-winners/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-SEB-92244", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Arts", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "Impassioned speeches highlighted the annual ceremony in Manhattan.", "title": "Ta-Nehisi Coates Wins National Book Award for Nonfiction", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2015/11/18/national-book-award-winners/", "image": {"width": 749, "identifier": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-LI741_coates_P_20151118225810.jpg", "height": 499}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Speakeasy", "article.id": "BL-SEB-92244", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2015-11-19T14:23:17-05:00"}, "article_summary": "Related Link: Betting Big on Literary NewcomersThe National Book Award, presented by the National Book Foundation, is one of the most prestigious literary prizes in the U.S.\nGetty ImagesTa-Nehisi Coates, whose book on race in America tapped into a pressing, national conversation, won the National Book Award for nonfiction Wednesday.\nHuman.\u201dMr. Shusterman\u2019s \u201cChallenger Deep\u201d is named after the deepest point on Earth: Challenger Deep, the southern part of the Marianas Trench.\n\u201cWe are okay with the presumption that black people\u2026 have a predisposition towards criminality,\u201d Mr. Coates said.\nYou won\u2019t make me a part of it.\u2019\u201dMr. Coates said he had been waiting 15 years for this moment."}
