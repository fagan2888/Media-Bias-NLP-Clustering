They don't, however, mention his 17 touchdowns vs. only nine interceptions. Nor do they mention that he is 8-6 as a starting quarterback and that in the 2011 season, he won a playoff game against the valiant Steelers defense. In that game, he shredded the Steelers' secondary for 316 years in the air and had two touchdowns, including the game-winner in overtime, without throwing an interception.\n\nWell, the haters would respond that it was a very good Denver team and that most of his passes in that game were relatively short. The haters also conveniently forget to mention that in the following year, with one of the greatest QBs of all time, Peyton Manning, at the helm, the Broncos lost their first playoff game.\n\nOne intangible the so-called experts often overlook is one I think makes for truly great quarterbacks - leadership. Tebow might not be the best passer in the NFL, or anywhere close to it, but his leadership can produce victories. He did it for Denver, but never got the chance for the Jets.\n\nWhen I think of the knocks against his passing ability, I think about two quarterbacks who were enormously successful in the NFL, yet mediocre passers, at best. One was the Hall of Famer Bobby Layne, who led the Detroit Lions to NFL championships in 1952 and 1953, with completion numbers of 48.4 and 45.8 percent, respectively (he was only 49 percent for his career). During those championship years, he threw 35 TDs and 41 interceptions. In his nine seasons with the Lions, he threw 118 TDs and 142 interceptions. How could it be? How would the experts explain two NFL championships in the face of those statistics? The answer is simple. Layne was a leader. He inspired the players around him to do things they didn't believe they had the ability to do. He was tough and never gave up.\n\nNext, I thought of Billy Kilmer, the last of the great single-wing quarterbacks in college. At UCLA, he was a dazzling runner and an extremely accurate passer. But early in his NFL career, he suffered severe shoulder injuries that crippled his ability to throw hard, accurate passes. And yet in 1972, he led the Redskins to a 7-3 record, and two playoff wins before losing to Miami in the Super Bowl. That year, he completed 53.3 percent of his passes. He was only 53.1 percent for his career, and threw 152 TDs and 146 INTs. With the Redskins, he was 50-23-1 in eight seasons. How did this quarterback who threw wounded ducks do so well? Again, it was leadership. He had the innate quality that is tough to quantify but easy to see. His teammates believed in him and played way over their heads because of that leadership.\n\nSo it's safe to say Tebow has not gotten a fair shot to start at quarterback in the NFL. Still, that's largely irrelevant to the discussion of whether he should be on the Eagles' roster come Opening Day, because no one, not even a Tebow lover like myself, contends he should start over Sam Bradford or Mark Sanchez. But there is no doubt in my mind he would be more useful as the third quarterback than Matt Barkley. Bradford, Sanchez and Barkley have basically the same skill sets, with various degree of ability. Tebow would bring an extra dimension to the position, one coach Chip Kelly could use in an extremely positive way.\n\nIn his brief playing time with the Jets, Tebow played blocking back on the punt team; three times, he took the direct snap and ran for first downs to keep drives alive. He could play some wildcat and even be in the shotgun with Bradford. In the red zone, he could run the read option and run out and pass if someone was open or run for a touchdown. Even the best running QBs go down when tackled head-on by defensive backs on the 1-yard line. If a defensive back meets Tebow head-on at the 1, both he and Tebow will wind up in the end zone. At 250 pounds, with his drive and determination, he is almost unstoppable on the move. Remember, in the year he started for Denver, he rushed the ball 122 times for 660 yards for an average of 5.4 yards.\n\nAfter watching Kelly for 2 years, I think he is the most creative offensive mind in football. Tebow undoubtedly has some real offensive skills, and I would love to see Kelly create opportunities to put those to work for the Birds.\n\nSo, welcome to Philadelphia, Tim. It's a great city, with great restaurants, historical venues, wonderful arts and culture, and football fans who appreciate effort. And one thing I know for sure, Tim, is that the effort you put into your career as a Bird will be second to none.\n\nEmail: asktheguv@gmail.com", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "news", "og": {"site_name": "philly-archives", "description": "THIS PAST WEEK, people have stopped me as usual, but not to talk about the mayor's race or the Affordable Care Act, but to ask me, \"Is Chip Kelly crazy?\" These fans are referring to the news that...", "title": "Forget his stats, Tim Tebow is a great leader", "url": "http://articles.philly.com/2015-04-27/sports/61546646_1_tim-tebow-nfl-playoff-game", "image": "http://media.philly.com/images/600*450/20150426_dn_0nn4jhul.jpg", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100001837105818, "app_id": 174828689230209}, "description": "THIS PAST WEEK, people have stopped me as usual, but not to talk about the mayor's race or the Affordable Care Act, but to ask me, \"Is Chip Kelly crazy?\" These fans are referring to the news that"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd1be\"", "article_summary": "It's a great city, with great restaurants, historical venues, wonderful arts and culture, and football fans who appreciate effort.\nBut early in his NFL career, he suffered severe shoulder injuries that crippled his ability to throw hard, accurate passes.\nIf a defensive back meets Tebow head-on at the 1, both he and Tebow will wind up in the end zone.\nTebow might not be the best passer in the NFL, or anywhere close to it, but his leadership can produce victories.\nOne intangible the so-called experts often overlook is one I think makes for truly great quarterbacks - leadership."}
