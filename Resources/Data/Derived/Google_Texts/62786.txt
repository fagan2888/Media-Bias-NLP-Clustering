Starting a business isn’t easy no matter where you live, but it’s easier in some places than others.

The survey looked at a variety of factors, including the ease of stating a business, hiring staff and adhering to regulations.

The study’s authors found that municipalities where the government promotes local businesses are perceived as the friendliest. Another factor that improved perceptions by business owners was the availability of a user-friendly website that makes regulatory compliance easier. Tax burdens were among the least important factors in evaluating local governments.
