Air travel is expected to be up over last year by one percent. Christmas Eve is certainly one of the busier travel days of the holiday season. That is evident at Wichita's Mid-Continent Airport Christmas Eve as fliers are trying to get to destinations in time for family celebrations.\n\nDiane Mannion, of Dallas, was waiting to catch a flight from Wichita to London after visiting relatives here. She describes the airport crowds as, \"Well it's pretty crazy. But you've got to do what you've got to do. We want to go see our family.\" Her daughter Courtney says, \"Yea, it's crazy. There's lots of people. And it's a little slow over there. BUT? But we get to fly and see other families. So that's nice.\"\n\nA traveler from Clay Center at Mid-Continent has a last name perfect for the season. Nicole Noel says, \"So far it's been good. Driving here wasn't too bad.\"\n\nAshton Lofgreen caught an early morning flight from Chicago's O'Hare Airport to Wichita. She says, \"You know it wasn't as bad as I expected it to be this morning. But it was my first time flying out on Christmas Eve. I expected it to be bad but it wasn't all that bad. I think I got out just in time. A snow storm coming in sounded like.\"\n\nNo snow or other weather factors to delay arrivals and departures in Wichita made for most flights to be on time, which is what travelers like to experience at Christmas or any other time.", "article_metadata": {"medium": "video", "description": "Holiday travelers encounter busy airports on Christmas Eve.", "language": "english", "author": "Chris Frank", "og": {"description": "Holiday travelers encounter busy airports on Christmas Eve.", "title": "Last minute flyers encounter busy airports", "url": "http://www.kake.com/home/headlines/Christmas-Eve--286808841.html", "image": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/739/A80/739A80F7F2424BE89F8D6F723F3A0A18", "video": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/AE7/171/AE7171B2FEE6419EA1EB08CFC93A9AA4.mp4", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.kake.com", "description": "Holiday travelers encounter busy airports on Christmas Eve.", "title": "Last minute flyers encounter busy airports", "url": "http://www.kake.com/home/headlines/Christmas-Eve--286808841.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/holiday+travel42.jpg", "creator": "@KAKEnews", "site": "@KAKEnews", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "video_type": "video/mp4", "video_height": 288, "keywords": "Last minute flyers encounter busy airports", "google-site-verification": "H0mev8O__gMqb34WcvOyZgBXFMRQZvDAQ0YTSGJ9hGQ", "video_width": 512, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Last minute flyers encounter busy"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2427\"", "article_summary": "That is evident at Wichita's Mid-Continent Airport Christmas Eve as fliers are trying to get to destinations in time for family celebrations.\nChristmas Eve is one of the busier holiday travel days as millions across the nation are trying to reach destinations in time for celebrations.\nChristmas Eve is certainly one of the busier travel days of the holiday season.\nBut it was my first time flying out on Christmas Eve.\nShe says, \"You know it wasn't as bad as I expected it to be this morning."}
