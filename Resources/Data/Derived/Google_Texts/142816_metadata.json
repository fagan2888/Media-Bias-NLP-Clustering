It\u2019s my Sabbath. I can\u2019t press the button.\u201d\n\nI\u2019ve never seen her before but I follow her across the street to her building, through the vestibule, and past a circle of Hasidic boys throwing a ball around. I\u2019m the only guy not wearing a yarmulke. I\u2019m in blue jeans and they\u2019re in black suits. It\u2019s 10 a.m.\n\nI pull open the elevator door. She steps in and faces me, both hands resting on her cane. She\u2019s the shape of a nesting doll.\n\n\u201cFour please,\u201d she says with a thick Yiddish accent. I press four, she thanks me, and I send her up to home.\n\nHow long had she been waiting outside for someone to work the elevator? Did her family watch helplessly from the window? Were her grandchildren asking themselves why did God say no elevators on Saturday?\n\nThe Sabbath, or Shabbos \u2013 sundown Friday to sundown Saturday \u2014 prohibits the real old world stuff like plowing earth, slaughtering and building a fire, but has since evolved to include no cars, no phones, no handling of cash, no electricity and more. So only a non-Jew could flip a light switch for the Sabbath-observing Jews, or turn on a stove, or work an elevator.\n\nBoro Park hosts the largest community of Orthodox Jews outside of Israel. Sixty percent of the people speak Yiddish. As devout as they are, they\u2019ve found loopholes around the laws of the Old Testament. Especially when it comes to the Sabbath, the time to honor the day God rested, according to the book of Genesis, after God created the universe.\n\nOne loophole is the Shabbos Goy. A Shabbos Goy is a non-Jew that Jews can rely on, someone who can operate outside the rules of the Sabbath. A teenage Elvis Presley was once a Shabbos Goy for his Jewish neighbors, the Fruchters, who lived above his family in their two-story flat in Memphis.\n\nTechnically I am not a Shabbos Goy. I just look like one to the ultra-Orthodox. I am technically a Jew. I was born to a Jewish mother and according to Jewish law there is no loophole around that. In the small town where I grew up I was the only Jewish kid. We were Reform Jews \u2013 which in the pyramid of Judaism is at the bottom. My mom keeps Matzo in the house not just to observe Passover but also because she thinks the giant tasteless, unleavened crackers are slimming. My sister went \u201ckosher\u201d in third grade just so she could get out of having to drink milk with our meat dinners. Now in Boro Park I observe my own small Judaism, in as much as I take advantage of the suspended alternate side parking rules that go in effect every Jewish holiday.\n\nNow my mother has selective amnesia when it comes to my agnosticism \u2013 though I\u2019m not entirely divorced from some of the values I learned in Hebrew school. The idea of a mitzvah is still something I think anyone who wants to be a good human being should subscribe to. Mitzvah in Hebrew means \u201ccommandment\u201d \u2013 but it also means to perform a good deed.\n\nWhen I first moved to Boro Park I noticed how the small community was weary of strangers such as myself. My goal was to perform a mitzvah in front of my new neighborhood so that I could be accepted as a trusted neighbor.\n\nOne day there was an old man struggling with his bicycle that was chained to a No Parking sign. His long beard looked older than me. I saw an opportunity to prove myself to the community \u2013 because everyone, I assumed, would be peering out their windows keeping score of any mitzvahs performed by strangers.\n\nThe old man pushed a lead pipe through the heavy bike chain, struggling to snap it in half by twisting tight. I asked if he needed help. \u201cI lost my key,\u201d he said and asked me to hold the pipe and twist as hard as I could. As I tried to snap the chain, I was thinking about how mitzvahs are not typically supposed to be selfless, but at the same time hoped people were watching me help this old man in need.\n\nFive Hasidic men ran out of their apartments and screamed, \u201cThat\u2019s not your bike!\u201d I dropped the pipe and ran. They chased us down the block. I took the long way back home, afraid the elders would banish me from Boro Park.\n\nI was in middle school when I began exploiting the God of my mother. I went to synagogue often only because they had cable TV. We didn\u2019t have cable at home. So I\u2019d dip into the library where the TV was hidden in the corner, past the ancient Torah and documents saved from the Holocaust, and I\u2019d get my dose of Cash Money and Blink 182 and Marilyn Manson on MTV. I learned to drink at the synagogue when I\u2019d steal the small cups of blessed wine every Friday night from behind the rabbi\u2019s back.\n\nIt was Christmastime when I sang a song I\u2019d made up at the top of my lungs on the school lunch line: Joy to the world \u2013 your God is dead. Even though, at home, my Catholic father had placed a Star of David atop our Christmas tree. In fourth grade one of the lunch monitors retaliated when I told her I was fasting for Yom Kippur. She threatened to send me to the principal if I didn\u2019t eat my lunch. She stood over me and watched me take every last bite of that peanut butter and jelly. I was more afraid of the principal than of God.\n\nAs the only Jew in school my mom pimped me out to my classes \u2013 the chosen boy to stand before his class and retell the Hanukkah story every year. Every year I had to fry latkes for the school. I became the voice of a whole religion and culture. The de facto Jew. I fielded all Jewish questions year-round. If I didn\u2019t know the answer, sometimes I\u2019d make one up, because I knew no one would know any better. Every Hanukkah my teachers would gift us a new menorah, so now my mother has a closet filled with menorahs. The Hanukkah presentations stopped in sixth grade when the born-again mother of one of my classmates claimed that I was trying to convert my homeroom to Judaism. The last thing I wanted was everyone to be Jewish. I pretty much had the synagogue to myself. My young atheism hiccupped when I thanked God for the born-again who put an end to my annual Hanukkah presentations.\n\nI had to maintain my Jewishness throughout middle school so I could keep up the charade of ditching school for services and cable TV. I learned to read and write Hebrew so I could dance with girls in tight dresses from my eighth grade class at my bar mitzvah. \u201cThis Is How We Do It\u201d on the DJ speakers. I hoped, maybe, that I sounded semi-exotic to the Catholic girls from class. I was an enigma in my spiked hair and baggy pants \u2013 the mouthpiece of the Hebrew God.\n\nAfter years of retelling the story of Hanukkah to my classmates, I always believed Hanukkah was a big deal, as big as Passover and Yom Kippur. There weren\u2019t other Jews around to tell me otherwise. It wasn\u2019t until I moved to Boro Park that I realized Hanukkah was as Hallmark as Valentine\u2019s Day. Hanukkah went mainstream to compete with Christmas. It was the holidays I knew little about that were the ones celebrated passionately in the streets of Boro Park \u2013 like Purim.\n\nWhenever people asked me what Purim was my answer was just Jewish Halloween. It was a costume party with pastries. We ate triangle-shaped cookies called hamantaschen. Hamantaschen means Haman\u2019s pockets. The cookies have three corners to symbolize Haman\u2019s hat. Hamantaschen are also known as Oznei Haman or Haman\u2019s Ears. As in Haman the Evil. The story of Purim goes that Haman was the Persian King\u2019s minister. Haman was the Persian king\u2019s right-hand man. He also wanted to kill all the Jews. Mordecai and Princess Esther saved the Jews by reminding the forgetful king that years prior Mordecai had actually saved the king\u2019s life. When the king remembered this he told the Jews to hang Haman and his co-conspirators. I\u2019d say Haman\u2019s our Voldemort, but most Jewish holidays have a Voldemort. However, Purim is the only one where we engage in revenge cannibalism via pastries. Christians eat the body of the man they love. Jews eat the ears of a man they killed.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Jews in my family are Jewish in our own way.
