A lot of coaches say \u201cnext man up,\u201d but Denver has had the depth to have little drop-off.\n\nThe big scare out of Sunday\u2019s game was a back injury to DeMarcus Ware in the first half. After the game, Ware said \u201chis back locked up\u201d and he thought he would be OK.\n\nCoach Gary Kubiak said all he knows at this point is that Ware\u2019s back was bothering him. He will have a better idea on Ware\u2019s status going forward after he talks to the trainers Monday afternoon.\n\nPick 6: The best place-kickers in NFL history\n\nWare was carted off after suffering a noncontact tweak of his back trying to make an adjustment on a Raiders\u2019 screen play.\n\nReserve outside linebackers Shaquil Barrett and Shane Ray stepped up, both notching sacks to maintain the Broncos\u2019 dominant pass-rush status.\n\nWare wasn\u2019t the only one. Cornerback Aqib Talib (ankle), safety Omar Bolden (foot) and running back Juwan Thompson (hamstring) all left the game with injuries.\n\nKubiak said Talib was sore Monday and considered his status day-to-day. Talib was hobbled by his ankle throughout the game and was spelled by cornerback Kayvon Webster. Talib received in-game treatment and returned for about 15 plays. .\n\nWebster came up big in his absence. He had a key pass deflection on a deep pass to Andre Holmes late in the fourth quarter when the Raiders were only down 9-7. If he doesn\u2019t make that play, the game could have had a different outcome.\n\nKubiak said Bolden was battling his plantar fasciitis that has been ailing him since Week 1, but he thought he would be fine.\n\nThompson had a nice 16-yard reception and Kubiak said the plan was to get him the ball more, but he hurt his hamstring limiting that luxury.\n\nAlso of note, tackle Tyler Polumbus played more snaps than Ryan Harris at left tackle due to Harris\u2019 lingering knee injury. Guard Max Garcia also played limited snaps as a reserve tackle.\n\nCameron Wolfe: 303-954-1891, cwolfe@denverpost.com or @CameronWolfe", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Denver Broncos get bit by injury bug, chomp back with depth", "title": "Denver Broncos get bit by injury bug, chomp back with depth", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/10/12/denver-broncos-get-bit-by-injury-bug-chomp-back-with-depth/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151008_120521_demarcus-ware-4.jpg", "height": 451}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151008_120521_demarcus-ware-4.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-10-12T15:04:53+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-21T08:25:42+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Nicks and bruises are starting to build up, yet the Broncos are hanging in there with a week left before the bye.\nAlso of note, tackle Tyler Polumbus played more snaps than Ryan Harris at left tackle due to Harris\u2019 lingering knee injury.\nHe will have a better idea on Ware\u2019s status going forward after he talks to the trainers Monday afternoon.\nThe big scare out of Sunday\u2019s game was a back injury to DeMarcus Ware in the first half.\nA lot of coaches say \u201cnext man up,\u201d but Denver has had the depth to have little drop-off."}
