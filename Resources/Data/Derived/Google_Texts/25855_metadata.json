A sign was placed over the house where the humans had lived announcing that \"All Animals Are Equal\" and this house was deemed off limits.\n\nAs time passed, it was recognized that some animals might in fact be better than others based on their particular traits. The horses, because of their strength became bearers of burdens. The pigs because of their \"administrative ability, ultimately moved into the house once occupied by the humans. Shortly thereafter, the sign seemed to change to read, \"All Animals Are Equal But Some Are More Equal Than Others.\" This was basically Mr. Orwell's story of communism in Russia.\n\nHmm, Congress seems to have moved into the human house with their exemption from significant provisions of the Affordable Care Act among other exemptions. Yet the general public doesn't seem to see this aspect. Could it be that the media is too tied to liberalism to make an issue of the pigs in the house?\n\nRichard T.
