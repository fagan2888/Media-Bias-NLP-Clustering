The timing of the two separate events may confuse some, and National Stroke Association and Allsup are reminding seniors and people with disabilities with Medicare, they do not have to purchase an exchange plan.\n\nTo help individuals better understand their Medicare options, the National Stroke Association brochure, Understanding Medicare and How It Works, is available online at http://www.stroke.org. Printed copies can be ordered free of charge.\n\n\u201cThe launch of the Affordable Care Act may make some Medicare beneficiaries doubt their current medical coverage,\u201d said Jim Baranski, CEO National Stroke Association. \u201cIt\u2019s important that Medicare beneficiaries, especially stroke survivors, understand that they will have the same benefits as they do now and do not unnecessarily purchase additional healthcare coverage.\u201d\n\nMedicare meets the ACA\u2019s individual responsibility requirement. \u201cIf you have Medicare, you do not have to purchase an exchange plan to avoid penalties,\u201d said Paula Muschler, Allsup Medicare Advisor\u00ae operations manager.\n\n\u201cHowever, it\u2019s still a good idea to review your current Medicare coverage and take advantage of the annual enrollment period to make changes,\u201d Muschler said. \u201cThere have been some changes to Medicare Advantage plans and Part D coverage for 2014. Stroke survivors and individuals with disabilities often have specific needs that are better met through a Medicare Advantage plan versus Original Medicare.\u201d\n\nFor an evaluation of Medicare options, call an Allsup Medicare Advisor specialist at (866) 521-7655 or visit Medicare.Allsup.com.
