Nelson Mandela was already a wanted man.\n\nApartheid would not end for 33 years. Mandela would not be removed from the U.S. terrorist watch list for 47 years. And Mandela would live 52 more years, becoming the head of his nation, and one of the most respected leaders in the world.\n\nBut in May 1961, Mandela was only an increasingly powerful opposition leader hiding from the government in the aftermath of a peaceful campaign for non-cooperation with the government, which South African authorities responded to by arresting 10,000 people and mobilizing the military.\n\nA reporter with the British television network ITN, Brian Widlake, arranged to meet with Mandela. It was Mandela's first TV interview, and he took the opportunity to declare that methods beyond non-violence and non-cooperation would be considered by the ANC.\n\nBut first, Mandela laid out his group's simple demand. \"The Africans require the franchise on the basis of one man, one vote. They want political independence,\" he told Widlake, who responds with a question about whether Mandela wants to boot the Europeans out of South Africa. \"We have made it very clear in our policy that South Africa is a country of many races,\" Mandela responds. \"There is room for all the various races in this country.\"", "article_metadata": {"description": "A 42-year-old Mandela spoke from hiding with a British reporter in the aftermath of a government crackdown.", "author": "Alexis C.
