Ted Cruz was booed off the stage for defending Israel while giving a keynote address at a conference for the same delegation of Christian leaders.\n\nThe In Defense of Christians summit, which was aimed at raising awareness of persecution against Arab Christiansa, featured speeches by several Hezbollah supporters and some of Bashar al-Assad\u2019s most vocal Christian allies.\n\nOne of the clerics who met with Obama was Lebanese Maronite Patriarch Beshara Rai, the Daily Star reported on Thursday.\n\nThe Washington Free Beacon reported on Wednesday that Rai has called Israel an \u201cenemy state that is occupying Lebanese territory\u201d and defended Hezbollah\u2019s right to attack the country.\n\n\u201cEveryone says why is Hezbollah carrying arms?\u201d said Rai in a 2011 interview with Al-Arabiya. \u201cWe responded that the international community did not exert pressure on Israel to withdraw from Lebanese territory. As long as there is an occupied Lebanese territory, Hezbollah will maintain that it wants to carry arms in defense of its land. What will we say to it then? Isn\u2019t [Hezbollah] right?\u201d\n\nRai also welcomed a meeting with Hezbollah terror leader Hassan Nasrallah when he returns to Lebanon to discuss the problem of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL or ISIS) in the region.\n\n\u201cA dialogue committee already exists between [the Lebanon Maronite Church] and Hezbollah, and we are ready to hold any meeting in this respect,\u201d said Rai late last month.\n\nThe Maronite leader said the meeting with Obama was productive, according to the Daily Star.\n\n\u201cObama promised us to work on protecting Lebanon from all the repercussions of what is happening in the region,\u201d said Rai. \u201cWe felt that Obama is concerned about the region and the danger posed by ISIS and wants to support the region and minorities through an action plan he is working on.\u201d\n\nAccording to an IDC press release, another attendee at the meeting with Obama was Orthodox Church Patriarch Moran Mor Ignatius Aphrem II, who posted photos on Facebook from his meeting with a \u201chigh level delegation from Hezbollah\u201d last week. Antioch Church patriarch Gregory III Laham, who has called anti-Christian terrorism in Iraq a \u201cZionist conspiracy against Islam,\u201d also attended, according to the press release. \u201cWe want to thank President Obama at this critical moment in history for meeting with the representatives of these Christian communities from the Middle East who face suffering and hardship for professing their religious beliefs,\u201d said IDC president Toufic Baaklini in a statement.\n\nCruz was shouted down during his speech to the IDC summit on Wednesday night after calling on the audience to stand with him in support of Israel and noting the persecution that Jews face in the Middle East.\n\n\u201cIf you will not stand with Israel, I will not stand with you,\u201d said Cruz before walking out, amid shouts from audience members to get off the stage.\n\nHe said the anti-Israel jeers came from a vocal minority at the conference and were not reflective of Christianity or the views of many attendees.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve certainly encountered audiences that disagreed with a particular point of view. But this virulent display of hatred and bigotry was remarkable, and considerably different from anything I\u2019ve previously encountered,\u201d Cruz told the Free Beacon Wednesday night.\n\n\u201cThe division and anti-Semitism expressed tonight by some of the crowd is not reflective of the teachings of Christ, and is in fact directly contrary to the tenets of Christianity.\u201d\n\nIDC President Toufic Baaklini said the audience heckling came from \u201ca few politically motivated opportunists\u201d to distract from the conferences focus on \u201copposing the shared threat of genocide, faced not only by our Christian brothers and sisters, but our Jewish brothers and sisters and people of all other faiths and all people of good will.\u201d\n\nThe White House did not return request for comment.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Meeting follows conference at which Ted Cruz was booed off stage for supporting Israel", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Free Beacon", "description": "President Barack Obama and White House national security adviser Susan Rice met with a delegation of Christian Middle Eastern leaders in Washington, D.C., on Thursday that included at least one Hezbol", "title": "Obama Meets With Hezbollah-Supporting Cleric on 9/11", "url": "http://freebeacon.com/national-security/obama-meets-with-hezbollah-supporting-cleric-on-911/", "image": "http://freebeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/obama-911-150x150.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "President Barack Obama and White House national security adviser Susan Rice met with a delegation of", "creator": "@alanagoodman", "image": "http://freebeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/obama-911-150x150.jpg", "title": "Obama Meets With Hezbollah-Supporting Cleric on 9/11", "site": "@freebeacon", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1047859882", "fb": {"app_id": "FB_APP_ID"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1661\"", "article_summary": "As long as there is an occupied Lebanese territory, Hezbollah will maintain that it wants to carry arms in defense of its land.\nOne of the clerics who met with Obama was Lebanese Maronite Patriarch Beshara Rai, the Daily Star reported on Thursday.\n\u201cWe responded that the international community did not exert pressure on Israel to withdraw from Lebanese territory.\n\u201cObama promised us to work on protecting Lebanon from all the repercussions of what is happening in the region,\u201d said Rai.\nThe Maronite leader said the meeting with Obama was productive, according to the Daily Star."}
