Children ran across the gymnasium practicing basketball the day after Christmas at the Southwick Community Center, where they come together for art, to play games, practice sports, and eat a hot meal.

The activity center is open six days a week, including much of the holiday season, and is free for the children.

"It's part of their growth," Deirdre Polk, recreation leader at the Southwick Community Center, said. "They are expecting us to be here. Christmas fell in the middle of the week so they didn't go anywhere, a lot of kids stayed here instead."

Susan Forte, a volunteer and grandparent who has four grandchildren attending the center, sat on the sidelines to watch her grandson play basketball.

"They need to be around other children, instead of sitting in the house watching television or playing the PlayStation, and it's good exercise," Forte said.

Another parent entered the gym talking and joking with staff before sitting down to watch her son play basketball.

"I like that they have a place to go off of the streets," Tawanta Cox said.

After basketball practice some of the kids joined together in the arts and crafts room to make beaded sports-themed bracelets, draw pictures about their holiday, or create inspiring pictures about them graduating college one day.

"Some of our kids, I don't think they would know what to do without us, especially during the holidays. They feel good when they are in here," Polk said.

All community centers will be closed on New Year's Day. For a list of programs by center, go to www.bestparksever.com.

In addition to the community centers, the Louisville Metro Office for Safe and Healthy Neighborhoods supports a range of youth activities and programs. For details, go to http://louisvilleky.gov/government/safe-neighborhoods/youth-activities.
