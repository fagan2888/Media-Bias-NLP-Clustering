Ted Cruz released a third ad in a week attacking front-runner Donald Trump\u2019s health care plan, calling it \u201cTrumpcare.\u201d\n\nThe 30-second spot from Keep the Promise 1 uses a clip from an interview Trump did with 60 Minutes in September, discussing his plans for Obamacare and how to keep Americans insured. The ad paints Trump\u2019s plan for government-funded, universal health care as a renamed version of Obamacare.\n\n\u201cEverybody has to be covered. This is an un-Republican thing for me to say,\u201d Trump says. \u201cI am going to take care of everybody \u2026 The government\u2019s gonna pay for it.\u201d\n\nThe ad snipped Trump\u2019s explanation that he could strike a deal to make it work.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re going to be taken care of. I would make a deal with existing hospitals to take care of [uninsured] people,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThe government\u2019s gonna pay for it. But we\u2019re going to save so much money on the other side. But for the most it\u2019s going to be a private plan and people are going to be able to go out and negotiate great plans with lots of different competition with lots of competitors with great companies and they can have their doctors, they can have plans, they can have everything.\u201d\n\nThe super PAC is also running ads targeting Trump for calling himself \u201cpro-choice\u201d on all aspects of abortion in 1999, and for praising Cruz at a February 2014 fundraiser in Florida. All three ads are part of a $2.5 million ad buy, running in Iowa and South Carolina until caucus and primary voting begins.", "article_metadata": {"liveFyreID": "aHR0cDovL3RyYWlsYmxhemVyc2Jsb2cuZGFsbGFzbmV3cy5jb20vMjAxNi8wMS9wcm8tY3J1ei1zdXBlci1wYWMtaGl0cy10cnVtcC13aXRoLXRydW1wY2FyZS1hZC5odG1sLw==", "generator": "WordPress 3.9.12", "author": "Christine Ayala", "og": {"site_name": "Trail Blazers Blog", "description": "WASHINGTON \u2014 A super PAC supporting Sen.
