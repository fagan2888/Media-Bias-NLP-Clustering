Although he only lived there three years \u2014 Coltrane died of cancer in 1967 at age 40 \u2014 musicians, including Carlos Santana and Coltrane\u2019s jazz saxophonist son Ravi, are among those backing a volunteer effort to turn the dilapidated, four-bedroom house into a museum and learning center.\n\n\u201cThe Coltrane Home is a beacon to anyone interested in jazz history, cultural history, African-American history, New York history and American history,\u201d Santana said in a statement promoting a Manhattan fundraiser where he helped raise $30,000. The guitar virtuoso has been a Coltrane fan for decades. He released a 1973 album with fellow guitarist John McLaughlin called \u201cLove Devotion Surrender\u201d as a Coltrane tribute.\n\nThe move to restore the home began about a decade ago when local jazz enthusiast Steve Fulgoni learned a developer had purchased the 3.5-acre property with plans to demolish the home and build three smaller houses. He organized a lobbying effort to save the home, and eventually Huntington town officials purchased the property from the developer for $975,000 and designated it as a town park.\n\nBut town officials told Fulgoni and his supporters, which by then included members of the Coltrane family, that any effort to create a museum would have to be privately funded.\n\nYears of neglect left the home infested with mold and in dire condition, Fulgoni said. However, much of the interior was essentially unchanged from when the Coltranes lived there in the 1960s.\n\nRon Stein, chief operating officer of Friends of the John Coltrane Home, said that before last month\u2019s event, the organization had raised about $120,000, which includes $35,000 in grants from the 1772 Foundation and the National Trust for Historic Preservation. There also has been about $200,000 of \u201cin-kind\u201d donations from architects, contractors, mold remediation and other services.\n\nStein and others say their goal is to raise about $1.5 million. The 50th anniversary of Coltrane\u2019s completion of \u201cA Love Supreme\u201d in 2014 has organizers dreaming of opening the house to visitors next year, but Stein conceded that may not be a realistic goal.\n\nHe said the support from Santana, Ravi Coltrane, and professor and author Cornel West at last month\u2019s fundraiser helped spark increased awareness for the project.\n\n\u201cWhat we need to do is seize the momentum from this recent event and get enough people to realize the importance of this investment, the urgency of making this investment,\u201d Stein said. \u201cPeople here and abroad need to understand the real importance of the Coltranes\u2019 legacy.\u201d\n\nIn 2011, the National Trust for Historic Preservation named the house one of America\u2019s 11 Most Endangered Historic Places.\n\n\u201cAlthough John Coltrane did not set out to write \u2018A Love Supreme\u2019 as a message about civil rights, this seminal work transcended racial barriers and became a symbol of unity at a time when the nation remained greatly divided over the issue of race,\u201d said Stephanie Meeks, president of the National Trust for Historic Preservation.\n\nThe house features a large meditation room that Coltrane\u2019s wife, jazz pianist Alice Coltrane, used for several years until she moved to California in 1973. The basement had a recording studio \u2014 long since removed \u2014 where the couple performed. Alice Coltrane died in 2006, shortly after meeting with the Long Island group and signing off on restoration efforts, according to Fulgoni.\n\nLast month\u2019s event in Greenwich Village sparked some serendipity.\n\nGreta Olsen, a former tenant who had rented a room, took a large stained-glass window that had adorned the meditation room when she moved in 2002. An attorney for the developer said the contents of the house were going to be thrown away, she said, so she was permitted to take the window.\n\nThen she heard a news report about the Santana fundraiser and contacted Fulgoni\u2019s group to return the 4-foot-round window.\n\nOlsen, who now lives in nearby Bellport, said she never found a proper place for the window in her home but held onto it nevertheless.\n\n\u201cI was so grateful I was able to return it,\u201d she told The Associated Press. \u201cI guess there was a reason why I had this thing. It\u2019s a little part of the history.\u201d\n\nAt last month\u2019s fundraiser, West sounded more like a preacher than a Princeton professor as he spoke of his admiration for Coltrane.\n\n\u201cI want to thank all of those who had the courage and the vision to bring us together to make sure the world always understands that John Coltrane embodied love. John Coltrane is courage exemplified. John Coltrane is genius enacted.\n\n\u201cHe enriched my life in a way that I do not have words to describe.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "News, Frank Eltman", "og": {"site_name": "CJOnline.com", "description": "DIX HILLS, N.Y. - In a quiet, tree-lined suburb of New York City sits an unassuming brick ranch house that many musicians consider hallowed ground.", "title": "Fans hope John Coltrane home can become N.Y. museum", "url": "http://cjonline.com/news/2013-11-02/fans-hope-john-coltrane-home-can-become-ny-museum", "image": "http://cjonline.com/sites/default/files/12777465.jpg", "type": "article"}, "description": "DIX HILLS, N.Y. \u2014 In a quiet, tree-lined suburb of New York City sits an unassuming brick ranch house that many musicians consider hallowed ground."}, "article_summary": "John Coltrane is courage exemplified.\nJohn Coltrane is genius enacted.\nThis is where saxophonist John Coltrane composed the epic 1964 jazz masterpiece \u201cA Love Supreme,\u201d shortly after moving into the Dix Hills, Long Island, home.\n\u201cI want to thank all of those who had the courage and the vision to bring us together to make sure the world always understands that John Coltrane embodied love.\nHe released a 1973 album with fellow guitarist John McLaughlin called \u201cLove Devotion Surrender\u201d as a Coltrane tribute."}
