Along with an instructor from the Donbas volunteer battalion who recently returned from the front lines, Khiraldo-Ramirez led the trainees through drills, teaching them how to react in an artillery strike and how to look for landmines.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re just simple infantrymen, we\u2019re not Navy SEALs or Green Berets,\u201d said Khiraldo-Ramirez, whose military skills are self-taught. \u201cWe train skills that every soldier should know.\u201d\n\nThe mission of the all-volunteer defense force\u2014which is not an official unit of the Ukrainian armed forces\u2014is twofold:\n\nFirst, teach recruits eligible for the draft the basic skills needed to survive their first 10 days of front-line combat service.\n\nSecond, train civilians in the basic military skills necessary to defend Kyiv in urban combat should pro-Russian separatists or the regular Russian army sack Kyiv.\n\nThe 318th Battalion\u2019s instructors mainly focus on basic skills, but some recruits have gone through more advanced training as snipers, medics and sappers.\n\n\u201cWe are at war, and each man has to be ready to defend himself,\u201d said Roman, a 318th Battalion military instructor and reserve officer in the regular Ukrainian army\u2014he asked not to have his last name used due to security concerns. \u201cWe have to be prepared to fight if the Russians come this far.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are at war, and each man has to be ready to defend himself,\u201d says Roman, a 318th Battalion military instructor and reserve officer in the regular Ukrainian army.\n\nWhile the shaky cease-fire continues to largely hold in eastern Ukraine despite daily reports of heavy weapons and small arms attacks, government officials and civilians take seriously the possibility that the conflict\u2019s front lines could ultimately reach as far as Ukraine\u2019s capital city and its nearly 3 million residents.\n\nIn September, Kyiv municipal officials announced the city\u2019s metro system would be used as a shelter during an attack, and across the city civilian volunteers have spray-painted signs on the sides of buildings with arrows pointing toward the nearest potential bomb shelter.\n\nRecent statements by Russian President Vladimir Putin have sparked anxiety in the Ukrainian capital.\n\n\u201cIf I want to, I can take Kyiv in two weeks,\u201d Putin told European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso at a European Union summit on the Ukraine crisis last September, according to Italy\u2019s La Repubblica newspaper.\n\nThe Kremlin later said the Russian president\u2019s comments were taken out of context.\n\nWhile the Russian military has the capacity to take Kyiv in two weeks, such an operation would likely strain Russia\u2019s military resources and Putin\u2019s political capital, said Luke Coffey, Margaret Thatcher fellow at The Heritage Foundation and a U.S. Army veteran.\n\n\u201cTaking Kyiv would require the overt assistance of tens of thousands of conventional Russian troops and support from a sizable portion of the local population,\u201d Coffey said. \u201cI do not think Vladimir Putin has the political will for the former, and as things currently stand, he does not have the latter.\u201d\n\nThere are more than 50 volunteer battalions in Ukraine. The civilian units, similar to armed militias, were formed at the beginning of the war in eastern Ukraine to support the regular Ukrainian military, which initially found itself ill-equipped to match the firepower of pro-Russian separatists.\n\n\u201cFor 23 years the Ukrainian armed forces were plundered,\u201d Khiraldo-Ramirez said. \u201cWe weren\u2019t prepared for war, and a lot of our best men died.\u201d\n\nBattalions like the 318th are dedicated to territorial defense, while there are also special police battalions and some battalions that fall under the auspices of the Ukrainian National Guard.\n\nSome volunteer battalions like the Azov Battalion, which operates out of Mariupol, and the Donbas Battalion, operating near Luhansk, are integrated into the regular army\u2019s chain of command and have played a key role in the conflict.\n\n\u201cWe thought that if we didn\u2019t stop the separatists in the Donbas, they would come all the way to Kyiv,\u201d said Maxim Masur, 25, who fought with the Aydar volunteer battalion near Luhansk in June 2014. \u201cWe heard that there were 50,000 Russian troops across the border at the time, and we were afraid of an all-out invasion.\u201d\n\nIn March 2014, as first reported by The Wall Street Journal, U.S. Department of Defense officials estimated there were about 50,000 Russian troops bordering Ukraine and inside Crimea. Moscow said the troop buildup was part of a military exercise.\n\nSome of the 318th Battalion\u2019s recruits ultimately join other volunteer units and the regular army on the front lines. Their objective is to learn how to survive their first 10 days in combat, which, according to the conventional wisdom among Ukrainian soldiers, is a bellwether for a soldier\u2019s long-term survivability and the threshold after which units accept new members as one of their own.\n\nThe first mass mobilization of Ukrainian men for military service was in March 2014, and many soldiers drafted in the early stages of the war said they weren\u2019t properly trained for combat, prompting the formation of volunteer battalions like the 318th, which focus on teaching draft-eligible men the skills they need to live.\n\nAccording to multiple Ukrainian active duty and reserve officers, the regular army\u2019s training program has improved since the first mobilization waves, but soldiers are still not receiving the training and equipment they need from a national military that is recovering from decades of financial neglect and an officer corps rife with corruption.\n\n\u201cIf there is a general mobilization, we don\u2019t think we would get the training we need,\u201d Roman said, explaining the 318th Battalion\u2019s mission. \u201cWe are learning skills to keep alive if we are called.\u201d\n\nUkraine launched its fourth mass mobilization on Jan. 20, calling up 50,000 men between 18 to 27 years old, and there are plans for two more mobilization waves in April and June.\n\n\u201cOur most important requirement is the free will of our recruits,\u201d Khiraldo-Ramirez said. \u201cSelflessness, and the willingness to volunteer are the most important qualities for a soldier.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "In an abandoned Soviet-era hospital on the outskirts of Kyiv, a civilian volunteer battalion meets every weekend to prepare for a Russian invasion.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "In an abandoned Soviet-era hospital on the outskirts of Kyiv, a civilian volunteer battalion meets every weekend to prepare for a Russian invasion.", "title": "Volunteer Battalion Prepares to Defend Ukraine's Capital", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/volunteermilitia.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-03-21T22:17:09+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1HVW4VL"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "In an abandoned Soviet-era hospital on the outskirts of Kyiv, a civilian volunteer battalion meets every weekend to prepare for a Russian invasion.", "title": "Volunteer Battalion Prepares to Defend Ukraine's Capital", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/volunteermilitia.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "International", "tag": "Ukraine", "published_time": "2015-03-16T17:48:30+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-03-21T22:17:09+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Ukraine, cease-fire, Russia, Donbas, Azov battalion, Mariupol, Kyiv"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcdd0d\"", "article_summary": "\u201cWe\u2019re just simple infantrymen, we\u2019re not Navy SEALs or Green Berets,\u201d said Khiraldo-Ramirez, whose military skills are self-taught.\n\u201cIf there is a general mobilization, we don\u2019t think we would get the training we need,\u201d Roman said, explaining the 318th Battalion\u2019s mission.\nKYIV, Ukraine\u2014In an abandoned Soviet-era hospital on the outskirts of the city, a civilian volunteer battalion meets every weekend to prepare for a Russian invasion.\nSecond, train civilians in the basic military skills necessary to defend Kyiv in urban combat should pro-Russian separatists or the regular Russian army sack Kyiv.\nSome of the 318th Battalion\u2019s recruits ultimately join other volunteer units and the regular army on the front lines."}
