Kevin Spacey’s and Julia Louis-Dreyfus’ characters on TV have a lot in common. Both “House of Cards” antihero Frank Underwood and “Veep” train wreck Selina Meyer (spoiler alert!) graduated from the vice-presidency to the presidency at the end of their respective seasons. But, for obvious reasons, Underwood and Meyer have favored fairly different looks.

Until today: Thanks for the nightmares, Entertainment Weekly. The magazine’s new issue gets two covers, one featuring Spacey made up as Meyer (pearls, blowout, red blazer) and Louis-Dreyfus inhabiting Underwood (Hart Schaffner Marx-y gray suit, creepy short wig).
