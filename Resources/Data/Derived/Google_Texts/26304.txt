Cleveland Regional Medical Center will not be reopening soon, if ever. The hospital voluntarily surrendered its license on Thursday, Aug. 29, following a complaint investigation on Aug. 14-15 by the Texas Department of State Health Services (DSHS).

According to Carrie Williams, DHSH spokesperson, multiple issues were found inside the hospital.

“Given the violations we found, we suggested to the hospital that it voluntarily close and surrender its license. Otherwise we would have sought an emergency removal of the license,” said Williams.

The examination of the hospital was prompted after DSHS received a complaint about a lack of air conditioning.

“The major issue we found was a lack of air conditioning, particularly in certain areas of the hospital - radiology, pharmacy and lab - that need to be kept at certain temperatures for medications to be stored properly,” Williams said.

When asked if other violations were committed that threaten patient and employee safety, Williams said her understanding is that fire doors were propped open.

“That’s not acceptable,” she said.

The hospital’s owner, RKM Management of Houston, was notified by DSHS of the steps needed to officially close the hospital, including establishing a custodian for medical records and notifying the state, local and federal healthcare agencies, including Medicaid, Medicare, Texas State Board of Pharmacy, Texas Department of Public Safety and area EMS providers.

The results of the DSHS inspection are not available to the public at this time.

“Because we were just there yesterday, the findings are still being written up. It’s not an instantaneous process,” said Williams. “It will take a couple of weeks for the findings to be available.”
