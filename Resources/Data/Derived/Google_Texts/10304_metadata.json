At least 10 people were killed by the quake that damaged buildings and slammed powerful waves into coastal towns, causing flooding in some.\u201d\n\n* The Fed made the right call: \u201cInvestors will have at least one more month to worry about whether the Federal Reserve is raising rates. In the face of jittery financial markets and a global slowdown, the Fed blinked on Thursday.\u201d\n\nGM : \u201cThe Justice Department has reached a settlement with General Motors over the issue of faulty ignition switches that led to over 100 deaths and hundreds of injuries, according to officials familiar with the case.\u201d\n\nCharleston : \u201cThe man who gave shelter to Dylann Roof in the weeks before the June killings of nine African-Americans in a Charleston church has been arrested by the FBI. Agents picked up Joseph \u201cJoey\u201d Meek Jr., 21, of Red Bank while he was at work Thursday afternoon, his girlfriend Lindsey Fry told The State newspaper just before 4 p.m.\u201d\n\nMissouri : \u201cLawmakers have rejected an effort to make Missouri the 26th right-to-work state.

Jay Nixon\u2019s veto.\u201d\n\n* McConnell goes 0 for 3 : \u201cSenate Democrats blocked a resolution disapproving the Iran nuclear deal for a third time Thursday, sealing a major foreign policy victory for President Obama. Senators voted 56-42 against ending debate on the resolution of disapproval, falling short of the 60 votes needed on the procedural motion.\u201d\n\nSarah Feinberg shouldn\u2019t face too much resistance: \u201cPresident Obama\u2019s choice to run the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) will face lawmakers in the Senate for a confirmation hearing on Thursday amid an intensifying fight over automating trains on the nation\u2019s railways.\u201d\n\nGood point : \u201cOn Wednesday night, for this year\u2019s debate at the Reagan Library, the [Affordable Care Act] got almost no attention at all\u2026. So why didn\u2019t the CNN hosts ask about it? Why didn\u2019t any of the Republican candidates strain to bring it up, the way Bachmann did in 2011?
