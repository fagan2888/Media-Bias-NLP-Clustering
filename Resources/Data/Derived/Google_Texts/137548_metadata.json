So how did the People\u2019s Party win the U.S. presidency and a majority of both houses of Congress in 2020?\n\nIt started four years before, with the election of 2016.\n\nAs you remember, Donald Trump didn\u2019t have enough delegates to become the Republican candidate, so the GOP convention that summer was \u201cbrokered\u201d \u2013 which meant the Party establishment took control, and nominated the Speaker of the House, Paul Ryan.\n\nTrump tried to incite riots but his \u201cI deserve to be president because I\u2019m the best person in the world!\u201d speech incited universal scorn instead, and he slunk off the national stage (his last words, shouted as he got into his stretch limousine, were \u201cFu*ck you, America!\u201d)\n\nOn the Democratic side, despite a large surge of votes for Bernie Sanders in the final months of the primaries, Hillary Clinton\u2019s stable of wealthy donors and superdelegates put her over the top.\n\nBoth Republican and Democratic political establishments breathed palpable sighs of relief, and congratulated themselves on remaining in control of the nation\u2019s politics.\n\nThey attributed Trump\u2019s rise to his fanning of bigotry and xenophobia, and Sanders\u2019s popularity to his fueling of left-wing extremism.\n\nThey conveniently ignored the deeper anger in both camps about the arbitrariness and unfairness of the economy, and about a political system rigged in favor of the rich and privileged.\n\nAnd they shut their eyes to the anti-establishment fury that had welled up among independents, young people, poor and middle-class Democrats, and white working-class Republicans.\n\nSo they went back to doing what they had been doing before. Establishment Republicans reverted to their old blather about the virtues of the \u201cfree market,\u201d and establishment Democrats returned to their perennial call for \u201cincremental reform.\u201d\n\nAnd Wall Street, big corporations, and a handful of billionaires resumed pulling the strings of both parties to make sure regulatory agencies didn\u2019t have enough staff to enforce rules, and to pass the Trans Pacific Partnership.\n\nEstablishment politicians also arranged to reduce taxes on big corporations and simultaneously increase federal subsidies to them, expand tax loopholes for the wealthy, and cut Social Security and Medicare to pay for it all. (\u201cSadly, we have no choice,\u201d said the new President, who had staffed the White House and Treasury with Wall Streeters and corporate lobbyists, and filled boards and commissions with corporate executives).", "article_metadata": {"description": "The former secretary of labor predicts a People's Party will rise in 2020 to challenge the political establishment", "title": "Robert Reich sees the future: America\u2019s two-party system is finished", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The former secretary of labor predicts a People's Party will rise in 2020 to challenge the political establishment", "title": "Robert Reich sees the future: America\u2019s two-party system is finished", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2016/03/27/robert_reich_this_is_a_working_class_revolt_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/01/robert_reich.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The former secretary of labor predicts a People's Party will rise in 2020 to challenge the political establishment", "title": "Robert Reich sees the future: America\u2019s two-party system is finished", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/01/robert_reich.jpg", "creator": "@rbreich", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Robert Reich", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Bernie Sanders, Donald Trump, People's Party, RobertReich.org, Tea Party", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "So how did the People\u2019s Party win the U.S. presidency and a majority of both houses of Congress in 2020?\nThey attributed Trump\u2019s rise to his fanning of bigotry and xenophobia, and Sanders\u2019s popularity to his fueling of left-wing extremism.\nBoth Republican and Democratic political establishments breathed palpable sighs of relief, and congratulated themselves on remaining in control of the nation\u2019s politics.\nTopics: Bernie Sanders, Donald Trump, People's Party, RobertReich.org, Tea Party, Politics NewsThis article originally appeared on AlterNetThird parties have rarely posed much of a threat to the dominant two parties in America.\nAnd they shut their eyes to the anti-establishment fury that had welled up among independents, young people, poor and middle-class Democrats, and white working-class Republicans."}
