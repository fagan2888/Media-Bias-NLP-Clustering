White House Press Secretary Jay Carney delivered his final briefing Wednesday afternoon before he departs to Hollywood for the filming of “A Christmas Story: 40 Years Later.”

Carney has been a frequent punching bag of the media — really, it hasn’t been unlike the relationship between Rocky Balboa and what’s in the meat locker — but as former John Boehner spokesman Brendan Buck classily observed, his job is “incredibly tough.” White House Press Secretary is one of the most visible positions in the Executive Branch; given the administration’s opacity and the president’s reluctance to stand open before the press, Carney may have been the face of the White House from time to time.

As he departs for other pursuits, let’s revisit some of his finest moments.

1. When he stumbled over a question about an important Benghazi email that was conveniently withheld.

2. When he addressed lyrics from a Jay Z track claiming the rapper got “White House clearance” to go to Cuba.

3. When he acknowledged the hipster glasses that landed him in the fashion section of The New York Times.

4. When he called a reporter’s inquiries about former HHS secretary Kathleen Sebelius “lame.”

5. When he became the spokesman for the group (that no one’s ever heard of) “Guided By Voices.”

That one’s actually quite timely, as Carney entered the briefing room Wednesday to the Guided By Voices song “Motor Away.”

There could’ve been a different and more fitting tune, though: Lynard Skynyrd’s “Don’t Ask Me No Questions.”

So, don’t ask me no questions

And I won’t tell you no lies

Carney said in 2013 that the White House would consult Congress before moving on any Bergdahl prison swap (whoops), shifted toward a sort of, Well, if you like your plan, you can keep your plan as long as we say it’s good Obamacare pitch, and said “[t]here has never been a more transparent administration.”

Solid.

So solid that he earned a bro hug for his efforts.

Josh Earnest, Carney’s replacement, begins Thursday.
