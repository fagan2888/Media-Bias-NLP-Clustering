But when it comes to women\u2019s salaries, it\u2019s a different story.\n\nWomen with a bachelor\u2019s degree or higher continue to earn much less than men, and Silicon Valley\u2019s pay gap is larger than the rest of the state or nationwide, according to a new report by Joint Venture Silicon Valley, a regional organization of government and industry leaders.In Santa Clara and San Mateo Counties, men holding bachelor\u2019s, professional or graduate degrees earned 52 to 61 percent more than their female counterparts in 2013, the most recent figures available. In 2012, that pay gap was 40 to 73 percent.\n\nRachel Massaro, senior research associate at Joint Venture Silicon Valley said, \u201cIt\u2019s huge. Every woman I\u2019ve talked to about it is dismayed and shocked.\u201d\n\nPersistent stereotypes about who belongs in engineering and technology and who belongs in leadership leads to unconscious bias embedding itself in people processes.\n\nAt the state and national level, men with bachelor\u2019s degrees or higher earned 41 to 49 percent more than women with similar educational achievements.Massaro said she believes that Silicon Valley\u2019s concentration of male engineers with high-paying professions is the underlying cause behind the trend. As Apple, Google, Facebook and Twitter disclosed last year, only about a third of their employees are female.\u201cIt has less to do with the culture of tech than the pool of available workers,\u201d said Massaro, during Joint Venture Silicon Valley\u2019s annual State of the Valley conference on Wednesday. \u201cThe real story is we have to engage girls to study math and science, they shouldn\u2019t be discouraged from entering male-dominated fields.\u201dThat only accounts for part of the story, however. The shortage of women also extends to the business side of tech companies, even though women account for about 40 percent of MBA graduates in the country.The largest Silicon Valley technology firms also have fewer female executives and directors than other publicly traded companies, according to a study by the law firm Fenwick & West.\u201cPersistent stereotypes about who belongs in engineering and technology and who belongs in leadership leads to unconscious bias embedding itself in people processes,\u201d Caroline Simard, research director at Stanford University\u2019s Clayman Institute for Gender Research said in an email. \u201cIt affects who is hired and who is promoted to technology leadership ranks.\u201d\n\nBut some change is underway for engineering and other technology fields, Stanford University President John Hennessy told attendees at Wednesday\u2019s conference.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen a dramatic increase in the number of women interested in, for example, environmental engineering or product design. We are even finally seeing some rise in computer science majors. So there\u2019s some hope there,\u201d he said.Nationwide, women lagged behind men\u2019s median salaries in almost every occupation, including female-dominated fields, and the disparity is worst for Hispanic women who earn about 54 percent of Caucasian men\u2019s earnings, according to a recent report by the American Association of University Women.Women working full-time face a pay gap in every state of the country. They come closest to an equal paycheck in Washington D.C., where they earned 91 percent of what men were paid. Louisiana had the worst income gap, at 66 percent. Though these state figures include all educational levels, the size of Louisiana\u2019s gap resembles the pay difference between highly educated women and men in Silicon Valley.\u201cWomen do make different choices than men and they often end up costing them more,\u201d Catherine Hill, vice president for research at the American Association of University Women said in an interview. \u201cChoices about the kinds of jobs they go into or parenthood \u2026 But people also make assumptions about how dedicated women are to the workforce, which can add up to lower pay.\u201dRanjani Mohana, a business owner who attended the State of the Valley conference, said she wasn\u2019t frustrated by the slow pace of change for women earning less than men just because of their gender.\u201cYes, it\u2019s there,\u201d said Mohana, president and chief executive officer of R Mo LLC, a San Ramon, Calif.-based company that helps small businesses get certified to work for the government. \u201cBut at the same time, women are more independent. I\u2019d say overall, women are advancing in so many different ways\u201d when compared to previous generations.Other participants at the conference said they were surprised by how large the region\u2019s gender wage disparity is.\u201cIt\u2019s amazing that we still see this gap going on,\u201d said Janette Langdell, a manager at Nova, a federally funded nonprofit employment and training agency in Sunnyvale.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Peninsula Press", "description": "Women with a bachelor\u2019s degree or higher continue to earn much less than men, and Silicon Valley\u2019s pay gap is larger than the rest of the state or nationwide.", "title": "Big gender pay gap persists in Silicon Valley despite booming economy - Peninsula Press", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://peninsulapress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Gender_Pay_Gap.png", "updated_time": "2015-03-02T16:20:27+00:00", "url": "http://peninsulapress.com/2015/02/06/gender-pay-gap-silicon-valley/", "type": "article"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/PeninsuPress", "section": "Business + Tech", "published_time": "2015-02-06T13:53:10+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-03-02T16:20:27+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "Women with a bachelor\u2019s degree or higher continue to earn much less than men, and Silicon Valley\u2019s pay gap is larger than the rest of the state or nationwide.", "creator": "@PeninsuPress", "image": "http://peninsulapress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Gender_Pay_Gap.png", "title": "Big gender pay gap persists in Silicon Valley despite booming economy - Peninsula Press", "site": "@PeninsuPress", "card": "summary"}, "generator": "WordPress 4.2.4", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca3d6\"", "article_summary": "The tech sector is fueling Silicon Valley\u2019s roaring economy with record-breaking numbers of new jobs, patents and IPOs.\nIn 2012, that pay gap was 40 to 73 percent.\nRachel Massaro, senior research associate at Joint Venture Silicon Valley said, \u201cIt\u2019s huge.\nThey come closest to an equal paycheck in Washington D.C., where they earned 91 percent of what men were paid.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen a dramatic increase in the number of women interested in, for example, environmental engineering or product design."}
