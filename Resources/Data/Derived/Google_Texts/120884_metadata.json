That problematic scenario supposedly drove statewide support for Obamacare; overburdened emergency rooms were being used en masse by those without health insurance, thanks to provisions under California law that mandate coverage via emergency room without regard to insurance.\n\nAccording to a study from the journal Health Affairs, from 2005 to 2011, injury-related visits to non-federal ERs declined markedly, nearly 1 percent, but the number of total ER visits increased markedly.
