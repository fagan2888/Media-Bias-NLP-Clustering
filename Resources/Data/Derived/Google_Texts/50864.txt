More than 116,000 Kentuckians have enrolled in new health insurance plans under the Affordable Care Act.

The Governor’s Office reports that enrollments through the state’s health exchange, KYnect (Connect), are up 93 percent since Thanksgiving. The exchange has averaged about thirteen-hundred new enrollees per day since it launched on Oct. 1.

About 1 in 4 enrollees have signed up for new private plans, with the rest joining Medicaid as a result of that program’s expansion.

The more than half a million Kentuckians without insurance have until April to get coverage. After that, they’ll face tax penalties as a result of being uninsured.
