Butch Otter used a press conference Thursday to announce that he\u2019d ask lawmakers to create a $30 million government entitlement program. The entitlement program would provide medical services to people who don\u2019t qualify for Medicaid or Obamacare insurance subsidies.\n\nOtter\u2019s announcement is bad. His proposal is a government entitlement, something for which Otter has experience. In 2003, as a congressman, Otter planned to vote against a Republican Medicare expansion plan. Otter held out, until his arm was twisted to support the proposal, guaranteeing its passage. This time, no one is twisting Otter\u2019s arm. This proposed entitlement program is a creature of his and his administration\u2019s creation.\n\nOtter\u2019s plan calls for medical providers to receive $32 per patient per month to provide primary health care services to about 78,000 people below the federal poverty line. The money would come entirely from state taxpayers; patients would be required to kick in some money, too, on an income-based sliding scale. According to an Idaho Department of Health and Welfare fact sheet, patients could stay on the program indefinitely.\n\nThe Otter proposal provides a formulaic approach to health care, declaring that every patient in every part of the state needs the same kind of services rendered through what\u2019s called a medical home. And it requires those medical homes to provide a level of primary care treatment dictated by politicians and bureaucrats in Boise.\n\nThe plan doesn\u2019t put an end to Idaho\u2019s county-state single-payer program for indigent care. The proposal contains nothing that would let communities invest in their own creative solutions for providing health care services to people in need. It is also silent about the need to help lift people out of poverty and become less reliant on government services.\n\nOtter\u2019s proposal should fail to gain traction with lawmakers who really do believe in limited government and who believe that solutions should come from the community and not from lawmakers and state agencies. The proposal should fail with lawmakers who don\u2019t want to create a government entitlement. I suspect it will not gain favor with liberal legislators who just want a check from the federal government for Medicaid expansion.\n\nAs I\u2019ve opined before, there is a conservative way to provide health care services to people who need it, temporarily, and with very limited involvement of politicians, bureaucrats and agencies. It requires leveraging the robust network of private charities and medical providers in the state, letting them create the solutions, partnerships and mentorships that lead people to better care and better health.\n\nOtter\u2019s latest health care proposal doesn\u2019t do that. It simply makes a new group of Idahoans dependent on a new government entitlement program, which is not a solution at all.\n\nHowever, Otter\u2019s announcement contains a flicker of good news. His proposal very likely means Medicaid expansion is dead for the year. Otter has been notoriously noncommittal when it comes to Medicaid expansion. Having waged war in 2013 to adopt an Obamacare insurance exchange \u2014 Idaho is still the only Republican-controlled state in the country to have one \u2014 Otter has refused to say whether he\u2019d take the next Obamacare step and expand Medicaid.\n\nNow, instead of playing the annual will-he-or-won\u2019t-he-propose-expanding-Medicaid game, Otter\u2019s playing a new, but familiar, entitlement game. His idea already has the support of Rep. Fred Wood of Burley and Sen. Lee Heider of Twin Falls, the Republican chairs the the Legislature\u2019s Health and Welfare Committees. Other legislators should be more reluctant. The question is whether Otter will twist arms as hard as his was 13 years ago to get the $30 million plan passed \u2014 and how many legislators are willing to have their legacies tarnished by a yes vote.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "IdahoReporter.com", "description": "Instead of focusing on how he might promote conservative ideas, such as tax relief, Gov.
