Dick Lamm remains consumed by the issues that challenge the state and nation. As co-director of the Institute for Public Policy Studies at the University of Denver, Lamm continues to challenge the norms when it comes to issues such as health care, channeling his often outspoken tenure in public service, first in the Colorado House and then as the three-term governor from 1975 to 1987.\n\nLamm, who turned 80 in August, recently sat down with The Denver Post in his campus office for a conversation that reflected on his tenure, the problem with TABOR, and the wild 2016 presidential race. An edited version follows:\n\nLamm: I\u2019m working on a big project right now. I am trying to make the case that there is a certain part of medical ethics that are unethical public policy. The medical ethics that look only at an individual patient drives spending that is so marginal compared to other important needs in our society. If I can get it together, it will offend a lot of people. What\u2019s new?\n\nHealth care and controversy were certainly a part of your terms as governor, particularly the speech in which you suggested that we all have a \u201cduty to die and get out of the way\u201d \u2014 comments you believe were taken out of context. It\u2019s still an issue that interests you, obviously.\n\nYeah, it does. \u2026 I\u2019m actually glad it happened. It started a wonderful conversation on this whole question, even though it was misquoted. All over the country there were dialogues and I was invited to speak and defend myself in a number of places. It was hell at the time, but I\u2019m glad it happened.\n\nWhat are some of these new ideas that you think would offend people?\n\nWell, that you can\u2019t build a modern health care system an individual at a time. It just drives me crazy to hear people say, \u201cWe don\u2019t want to ration health care.\u201d The United States rations more health care than any other developed country in the world. I would say that I\u2019m trying to take health care from \u201cme\u201d to \u201cwe.\u201d\n\nWhat ethical considerations need to change to get to that point?\n\nMedical ethics were developed over the last 500 years or even more, when there was no government funding and there were not that many things we could do for people as they got sick.\n\nSo the nature of health care, or the delivery of health care, has dramatically changed. It\u2019s gone from a private issue, where you call the doctor and you pay the doctor to come out \u2014 which was essentially what health care was when I was born \u2014 to a social and political institution. But we still have this hangover from the starting days of health care. Doctors take their ethical duties with no lateral vision \u2014 they don\u2019t look at other needs of society, and now health care seems to have a trump.\n\nAbout 50 percent of health care now is paid for by taxpayers, but yet there\u2019s no way to compare the spending on health care with other public policy needs. \u2026 It\u2019s highly technical, lots of \u201cmiracle medicine,\u201d at great cost. We\u2019ve got to find a way to compare other needs \u2014 our roads, our education system and other things \u2014 with this health care spending.\n\nIn 1960, we spent 6 percent of gross national product on education, 6 percent on defense, 6 percent on health care. Today, we spend about 6 percent on education, about 5 percent on defense, 17.2 percent on health care. It\u2019s been the explosive issue. Never has a society put as much money outside a war in one area as we\u2019ve put into health care.\n\nAnother issue from your tenure is the Olympics. Boston recently rejected the Olympics, decades after you fought the 1976 Winter Games after Denver won the bid. What did you think of Boston\u2019s move?\n\nI went to the Olympics in 1960 when I was in law school in Berkeley, California. I love the Olympics \u2014 I don\u2019t want to do it any harm. But i think it\u2019s doing itself harm. \u2026\n\nI voted to invite the Olympics here. But in 1969 or 1970, I started looking at the figures: Sapporo, Japan, had just lost $1 billion, Montreal has just lost $1 billion. And I started asking questions. I wish the Olympics good luck, but their real enemy is themselves. They demand all of these new facilities at such expense. It\u2019s grown to become such a fiscal burden that very few places want to invite it.\n\nHow much do you look back on these issues from your tenure?\n\nWhat an embarrassing question. In high school, I read a story about a guy who intercepted a pass behind his own goal line and ran 100 yards for a touchdown and won the game. He\u2019s feted in the town. But the further he got away from that run, the less of a big deal it became. But he couldn\u2019t let go of it. So pretty soon he was saying, \u201cRemember what I did?,\u201d instead of people slapping him on the back and saying, \u201cGreat job.\u201d\n\nI think of that often. I look back with great fondness and pride. The governorship is the biggest thing that ever happened in my life. It was an honor of a hundred lifetimes. But I try not to think of that.\n\nThe Taxpayer\u2019s Bill of Rights went into the constitution years after you left office, but a new group called Building a Better Colorado wants the state to take another look at it and other fiscal issues. Do you think TABOR needs an overhaul?\n\nIt\u2019s absolutely needed. I don\u2019t know how they are going to thread the needle, but I hope they do. The real gubernatorial hero in my mind on the TABOR issue was Bill Owens. National Review listed him as America\u2019s most conservative governor, and he had the guts to support Referendum C and D, which were exemptions to TABOR. He did it. Every political adviser would be telling him, \u201cGod, you\u2019ve got this good thing going. You\u2019re getting national news. You\u2019re going to step on your story.\u201d\n\nI have no problem joining whatever they come up with \u2014 I\u2019d have to look at it. But I think TABOR needs change. Our public needs are growing incredibly fast. Our roads are deteriorating. There are so many needs in this state.\n\nYou know, if you look at the national picture, why don\u2019t we take that 17.2 percent that we spend on health care and spend an average of what Europeans do, when they keep their people every bit as healthy, if not healthier. They have, let\u2019s say, 11 or 12 percent.\n\nIf you could take that 5 or 6 percent between those two, all of a sudden there is a whole different budget thing that we would be facing. That\u2019s one of the reasons I\u2019m really interested in health care. It\u2019s filled with dedicated people, but it\u2019s an organizational and fiscal nightmare.\n\nWhat other top challenges do you think Colorado faces?\n\nI would still see the first issue as how do you make the political machine work in a more bipartisan basis.\n\nIs it broken in your view?\n\nAs a state lawmaker, I got the nation\u2019s first liberalized abortion law through a Republican legislature signed by a Republican governor. They were wonderful people. Gov. John Love was a moderate. Republicans in the legislature were moderates . Everybody worked together. I\u2019m just not an old man looking back at the good old days \u2014 well, I am to some degree. \u2026 A great state needs an efficient and effective legislative body and we don\u2019t have it.\n\nWhat do you make of this much-hyped 2016 presidential campaign?\n\nI\u2019m really sobered by the fact that I did not think in 1980 that Ronald Reagan would ever get the nomination. He not only got the nomination, but I just read a biography of Ronald Reagan and came away admiring certain aspects of him, particularly the international dealings with Mikhail Gorbachev. Reagan was not near as bad as I thought he was going to be.\n\nSo am I now repeating my same mistake? I don\u2019t think so. I think that Donald Trump is just beyond any model that we\u2019ve had. I don\u2019t want to compare him to a certain Georgia governor way back when, but he is comparable to Ross Perot. I think he will go too far too many times. \u2026 It\u2019s just so unthinkable that he would be their candidate. I think he\u2019s doing damage to the Republican Party for a generation, particularly with Hispanics.\n\nOn the Democratic side, you have front-runner Hillary Clinton \u2014\n\nDid you see The New Yorker \u201cTalk of the Town\u201d when they talked about Hillary and the e-mail problem? For the first time, it really was sobering. They talked about how (Retired Army Gen. David) Petraeus pleaded to a misdemeanor for something very close to this question of mishandling of classified documents. (Former National Security Adviser to President Bill Clinton) Sandy Berger \u2014 he mishandled classified operations and he pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor just like Petraeus. All of a sudden it dawned on me.\n\nWhat are they to do? My poor wife. We\u2019ve know the Clintons \u2014 we\u2019ve served with the Clintons. Dottie (Lamm) and Hillary are really very close, and she\u2019s just shattered \u2014 not discouraged, though, she\u2019s still very much on board.\n\nCan Hillary Clinton win?\n\nI think she can win the Democratic nomination unless something worse happens, and I think there\u2019s a one in three chance that something worse does happen. But I think the words they associate with her \u2014 distrustful, liar and dishonest \u2014 that\u2019s not good stuff.\n\nIf she must step aside because of the controversy, who can fill her shoes?\n\nI think the most likely person would be (Vice President Joe) Biden. He would be the one to pick up the pieces. I don\u2019t think it would be Martin O\u2019Malley, and I don\u2019t think it would be Bernie Sanders, as wonderful a human being as he seems to be.\n\nAre you a Sanders fan?\n\nI will show my class a video of Bernie Sanders saying we are going to increase Social Security for the elderly and we are going to do it without any new taxes and without adding to the debt. You can\u2019t do that.\n\nHe\u2019s such a nice man but, no, I could not \u2014 I\u2019d vote for him if he was the candidate against almost any Republican out there, but I think it would be a tragic mistake to nominate Bernie Sanders.\n\nWhat do you think of the current political debate?\n\nI really think the members of my generation have been poor trustees of America. My mother and father fought a war and a depression and left me with very little federal debt. I\u2019m leaving you with a staggering amount of federal debt. They built the federal highway system. I\u2019ve not even adequately maintained it. They left with effective and efficient institutions \u2026 .\n\nI really have a very guilty conscience when I look at my grandchildren. I don\u2019t feel a personal guilt, I tried \u2026 .\n\nWhat you need to have a great generation is a great crisis, whether a fiscal crisis because of our constant borrowing or an environmental crisis because of global warming, and the millennials could well be the next great generation.\n\nTo send a letter to the editor about this article, submit online or check out our guidelines for how to submit by e-mail or mail.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Frank: Former Colorado Gov.
