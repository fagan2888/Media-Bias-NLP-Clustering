The Miami-native was only 23-years-old.\n\nWe are saddened to share that Ravens DB Tray Walker has passed away at age 23: https://t.co/Vt9IJg3J1Q pic.twitter.com/8pYJS3EEoO \u2014 NFL (@NFL) March 18, 2016\n\nWalker crashed at an intersection on a Florida highway heading to Miami. Sadly, Walker\u2019s bike didn\u2019t have headlights and he wasn\u2019t wearing a helmet. He suffered severe head trauma that the doctors couldn\u2019t relieve. Walker\u2019s agent Ron Butler told the Miami Herald, \u201cThe doctors tried to get the swelling down but I guess his brain went too long without oxygen.\u201d\n\nIn a statement, Ravens coach John Harbaugh said, \u201cTray was a young man with a good and kind heart. \u201cHe was humble and loved everything about being part of the Ravens\u2019 team. He loved his teammates, the practice and the preparation, and that showed every day. He was coachable, did his most to improve and worked to become the best. I\u2019ll never forget that smile. He always seemed to be next to me during the national anthem; then we would give each other a big hug. May he rest in the Peace of Christ Jesus forever.\u201d\n\nWe send our deepest condolences to the Waker family.

What we believed to be an adorable 11-year-old boy is now a beautiful 17-year old transgender woman, CNN reported.\n\nWhile for us this may be a huge change, but Marcelas told CNN she has long identified as a female. \u201cI\u2019m going through a reinvention process,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m growing into adulthood. I\u2019m not the Obamacare kid anymore.\u201d\n\nMarcelas does what every other teen does: \u201cShe listens to hip-hop artist Drake and Michael Jackson. Hangs out at the mall with friends. Even writes songs to express what she struggles to say to others in conversations,\u201d CNN noted. Yet, her coming out wasn\u2019t easy, especially for her own grandmother. Gina Owens admitted that she had serious issues with it, but has now come around to accept for Marcelas for who she is.\n\nOn Marcelas 17th birthday, Owens wrote the following on her Facebook page:\n\n\u201cMy grandson is on a new journey in life\u2026 I am so happy that SHE has trusted our relationship enough where SHE felt more comfortable sharing with me first; BEFORE the rest of the world\u2026 I give my heart & blessing to HER. I LOVE YOU AND YOUR COURAGE IN LIFE, MORE THAN YOU WILL EVER KNOW. Walk your journey in love & light.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s what love and acceptance looks like folks.

Last month, MHP abruptly walked away from show claiming it had been hijacked by the network and that racism was an underlying factor in her mistreatment.\n\n\u201cI will not be used as a tool for their purposes,\u201d Harris-Perry wrote of MSNBC in an email to her staff that went public. \u201cI am not a token, mammy, or little brown bobble head. I am not owned by Lack, Griffin or MSNBC.\u201d\n\nMHP was one of few people of color to have shows on the network.\n\nReid, who currently fills in for other anchors and has some presidential campaign reporting, had her own show on the cable news network, but it was cancelled last year due to low-ratings. MSNBC has yet to comment on whether they are handing this time slot over to Reid.\n\nFYI: Mediaite also said that MHP was going to work for Fusion, which MHP confirmed wasn\u2019t rue. So time will tell if this actually happens.

The state song was written in 1861 by James Ryder Randall who was grieving the death of his friend who had been killed in the Civil War.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s time to get rid of the verse that basically criticizes and makes us look bad,\u201d said Sen. Ronald N. Young. \u201cThe [song] is degrading to Maryland and should not represent us moving forward.\u201d\n\nSome lawmakers, such as Sen. Robert G. Cassilly, who oppose the bill claim that by removing the words, this generation cannot learn from the past mistakes. Cassilly told the Washington Post that while their state has \u201cbad blemishes\u201d, this should \u201cuse[d] it as a teaching point and move forward. . . . The idea of excising our history, that\u2019s not America.\u201d\n\nNow, the House has to vote on this measure.
