He also wants to bring back waterboarding, an interrogation technique ended by Obama and considered by many to be torture.\n\nRelated: Donald Trump\u2019s 8 (Most Recent) Blatant Lies\n\n\u201cWould I approve waterboarding? You bet you\u2019re ass I would, in a heartbeat,\u201d Trump said Monday at a campaign event in Ohio, adding he would approve \u201cmore than that.\u201d\n\n\"Only a stupid person would say it doesn't work,\u201d he said of waterboarding. \u201cAnd you know what? If it doesn't work, they deserve it anyway, for what they\u2019re doing.\"\n\nJeb Bush.\n\nIn a speech at the Citadel last week, the former Florida governor called for U.S. ground troops to battle ISIS forces in Iraq and Syria.\n\nIn doing so, Bush finally stopped tip-toeing around the baggage associated with his brother, President George W. Bush, who started the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\nRelated: Rubio Is Right: Time for Boomers to Pass On the Power\n\nThe former state house chief has doubled downed on strident calls for military action, attempting to make up ground on Trump, who has now spent four months atop the polls.\n\n\u201cAre we fighting a war or is this a law enforcement exercise? Make it a war,\u201d he said Tuesday during a campaign stop in South Carolina.\n\nMarco Rubio.\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of the Paris attacks, the Florida senator sought to burnish his hawkish credentials and called the conflict between the West and the Islamic State a \u201cclash of civilizations.\u201d\n\nRubio, 44, stuck with that theme in his first television ad, which began airing nationally on Tuesday on cable.\n\n\u201cThis is a civilizational struggle between the values of freedom and liberty, and radical Islamic terror,\u201d he says in the 30-second spot.\n\n\"What happened in Paris could happen here. There is no middle ground,\" Rubio adds. \"These aren't disgruntled or disempowered people. These are radical terrorists who want to kill us, because we let women drive, because we let girls go to school.\"\n\nThe surging White House hopeful, who last week rolled out a four-point plan to defeat ISIS that features ground troops and the creation of a no-fly zone for civilians in Syria, closes the ad by saying \u201cthere can be no arrangement or negotiation. Either they win or we do.\u201d\n\nChris Christie.\n\nOn Tuesday, the New Jersey governor and former U.S. attorney opened up on his GOP rivals, claiming their inexperience leaves them unprepared for the foreign policy challenges a commander in chief faces.\n\n\u201cNew is untarnished, but new is untested. New is not necessarily reliable. New seems fabulous until the moment comes when you need experience,\u201d he said in a speech at the Council on Foreign Relations in Washington. \u201cLess than one term in the U.S. Senate has proven to be woeful training in the Oval Office.\u201d\n\nThe remarks, referencing Obama\u2019s political career, seemed to be aimed at Rubio and fellow contenders, Sens. Ted Cruz (R-TX) and Rand Paul (R-KY), both in their first terms.\n\nChristie, who was bumped from the main stage of the last GOP debate, is trying to gin up enough support to rejoin the top-tier when the candidates gather again next month. In addition to trumpeting his law enforcement background, he reportedly has begun to talk in deeply personal terms about the friends he lost in the September 11 terrorist attacks.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The 2016 presidential race is undergoing a sweeping reconfiguration, with national security storming to the top of voter concerns following the recent Islamic State attacks in Paris and the downing of Russian fighter jet by Turkey that has the U.S. and its allies calling for calm on both sides.", "title": "How National Security Tough Talk Is Taking over the GOP Campaign", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/11/25/How-National-Security-Tough-Talk-Taking-over-GOP-Campaign", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/07312015_Air_Force_Fighter_Jets.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/11/25/How-National-Security-Tough-Talk-Taking-over-GOP-Campaign", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/07312015_Air_Force_Fighter_Jets.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "The 2016 presidential race is undergoing a sweeping reconfiguration, with national security storming to the top of voter concerns following the recent Islamic State attacks in Paris and the downing of Russian fighter jet by Turkey that has the U.S. and its allies calling for calm on both sides.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe375f\"", "article_summary": "There is no middle ground,\" Rubio adds.\nHe also wants to bring back waterboarding, an interrogation technique ended by Obama and considered by many to be torture.\nThe day before the carnage in Paris that killed 130 people, Trump said he would \u201cbomb the s--- out of\u201d ISIS if he were elected.\nSince the attacks, the billionaire has called for the \u201csurveillance of certain mosques\u201d and creating a database for Syrian refugees who enter the country.\nIn a speech at the Citadel last week, the former Florida governor called for U.S. ground troops to battle ISIS forces in Iraq and Syria."}
