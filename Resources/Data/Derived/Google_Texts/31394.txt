EDITOR: Consider as a school district budget starting point 20 children per classroom and a teacher compensated at $75,000, including benefits, for a nine-month school year. This would equal $7.725 million, or only 31 percent of Mosinee School District’s $24.7 million annual budget. Taxpayers of the MSD just dodged an additional 20-year, $289,000 per-month building debt.

It becomes easy to see how public school budgets can become so bloated.

Bullet point No. 1 from the referendum floor plan alteration highlights was “update science labs.” In the district’s March agenda, item 12B was for “approval of additional funding for project estimate costs to complete first softball field.” (Emphasis added.)

Will the School Board exercise good judgment and redirect this approved $85,000 expenditure to update the science labs?

The larger question becomes: Why aren’t all School Board members informed on cost to date, estimated costs to complete and future financial commitments of overhead and maintenance of this Mosinee Community Athletic Association sports complex?
