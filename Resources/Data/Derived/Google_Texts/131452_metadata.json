But Campbell feared if Mount Carmel Academy didn\u2019t return to the area, other families, businesses and schools wouldn\u2019t either.\n\n\u201cI really knew in my heart, if we didn\u2019t come back, this whole area would not come back,\u201d Campbell told The Daily Signal. \u201cWe had been a hallmark out here for so many years.\u201d\n\n>>> See Related Story: Here\u2019s How Hurricane Katrina Changed Schools in New Orleans\n\nAt first, the biggest thing was figuring out the basics, like how to get clean water. Instead of waiting on the city to fix its supply, Campbell\u2019s assistant came up with the idea to dig a well. At 800 feet, she hit water, and the school was on the road to recovery.\n\nOn Jan. 17, 2006, just four months after the storm, students returned to school before some of their houses were close to being ready. Some of them slept on the floors of their friends\u2019 homes, while others stayed in temporary trailers.\n\nCampbell credits the school\u2019s comeback to a community of parents, teachers, administrators and volunteers who came together.\n\nGovernment officials and flood insurance did help, but Campbell said the initial rebuilding effort\u2014which cost some $3-4 million\u2014came from small donations from churches, schools and youth groups located across the country.\n\nTeachers became janitors, administrators became maintenance workers and Campbell became a financier, responsible for overseeing a $25 million recovery project, the total cost of restoring the school.\n\nTo document Mount Carmel Academy\u2019s inspiring recovery, The Daily Signal traveled to New Orleans and spoke with Campbell, who was gearing up to celebrate Hurricane Katrina\u2019s 10-year anniversary. Her story is told in our new video.\n\n\u201cIt sounds strange to celebrate a devastating event that caused so much pain and suffering,\u201d Campbell said. \u201cBut we\u2019re celebrating the fact that we\u2019ve overcome this. We\u2019re celebrating the rebirth, the resurrection of our city, of our school, and of so many people who learned from the lessons of Katrina that we can do it if we work together.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "When Hurricane Katrina left Mount Carmel Academy under 10 feet of water, many thought the school would be gone forever.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "When Hurricane Katrina left Mount Carmel Academy under 10 feet of water, many thought the school would be gone forever.", "title": "How One Catholic School Found Faith in the Floodwaters", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/Screenshot_NOLA_Clean.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-08-27T10:15:39+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1K3Z4EG"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "When Hurricane Katrina left Mount Carmel Academy under 10 feet of water, many thought the school would be gone forever.", "title": "How One Catholic School Found Faith in the Floodwaters", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/Screenshot_NOLA_Clean.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Education", "tag": "k-12", "published_time": "2015-08-27T03:01:09+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-08-27T10:15:39+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "hurricane katrina, katrina 10 years, katrina anniversary, mount carmel academy, mount carmel, lakeview, religion, religious liberty"}, "article_summary": "NEW ORLEANS\u2014When Hurricane Katrina left Mount Carmel Academy under 10 feet of water, many thought the school would be gone forever.\nBut Campbell feared if Mount Carmel Academy didn\u2019t return to the area, other families, businesses and schools wouldn\u2019t either.\nAt 800 feet, she hit water, and the school was on the road to recovery.\nThe president of Mount Carmel Academy, Sister Camille Anne Campbell, had a yacht wash up on her front porch, just a feet away from the school\u2019s main entrance.\nLocated in the Lakeview neighborhood, among the hardest hit areas in New Orleans, the all-girls Catholic high school was trapped between two breaks in the levees that were supposed to protect the city."}
