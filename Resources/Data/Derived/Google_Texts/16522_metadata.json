That would be immigration reform. The latest legislation passed by the Democratic-controlled Senate, the \u201cBorder Security, Economic Opportunity, and Immigration Modernization Act,\u201d would cost $20.2 billion annually, Mr. Brady notes.\n\nHUBRIS AND GODZILLA: THE MINI-REVIEWS\n\nAnd the spell lingers. President Obama\u2019s State of the Union address will be a catalyst for analysis at least until the Sunday talk shows crank up and have a go. Scores of reactions, pre-buttals and rebuttals from everyone else, meanwhile, have been unleashed via press releases, broadcast appearances, tweets and blog posts. Here\u2019s a few, slimmed down from original statements, with apologies to the speakers in question.\n\n\u201cThe extreme hubris and naivet that emanated from that speech was something new and alarming,\u201d (Sarah Palin); \u201cObamacare \u2014 all by itself \u2014 is an inequality Godzilla that has robbed working families of their insurance, their doctors, their wages and their jobs,\u201d (Sen. Mike Lee, Utah Republican); \u201cAll in all, the state of our union is a big mess created by Republicans and Democrats,\u201d (Libertarian Party executive director Wes Benedict); \u201cIf the president made one thing clear tonight, it is this: It\u2019s his way or the highway\u201d (Matt Kibbe, president of FreedomWorks).\n\nAnd a few more: \u201cThe strength of our Union is in our states, not Washington,\u201d (Texas Gov. Rick Perry); \u201cSuccess is created in studio apartments and garages, at kitchen tables, and in classrooms across the nation, not in government conference rooms in Washington.\u201d (Sen. Tim Scott, South Carolina Republican)\n\nAnd more: \u201cFor a moment, I thought the news accidentally reran last year\u2019s State of the Union, because all I really saw was more of the same,\u201d (Gregory Angelo, executive director of Log Cabin Republicans); \u201cLots of backslaps, handshakes and kisses from the ladies as Pres Obama makes his way out of the House Chamber.\u201d (CBS New White House correspondent Mark Knoller, in a Tweet); President Obama\u2019s State of the Union once again advanced the narrative that women are a victim class in need of greater government protection,\u201d (Sabrina Schaeffer, executive director of the Independent Women\u2019s Forum).\n\nTHE PEOPLE SPEAK\n\nThe audience was a little smaller. Nielsen ratings of the aforementioned State of the Union address place the number of viewers at 33,299,172 \u2014 down from 33.5 million a year ago, and the lowest number since 2000. The media giant also tabulated that 2.1 million speech-centric Tweets were abuzz during the broadcast. Meanwhile, Fox News won the ratings race among cable news networks, drawing 4.7 million viewers; MSNBC won 2.2 million, CNN 2 million.\n\nAnd reactions? Forty-four percent of speech watchers had a very positive reaction, down from 53 percent in 2013, with 32 percent saying they had a somewhat positive response and 22 percent with a negative response, reports CNN political editor Paul Steinhauser, following the network\u2019s insta-poll of 371 Americans who watched the event.\n\nThe favorable rating is below the 48 percent who said they had a very positive reaction to then President George W. Bush\u2019s 2006 address as he began his sixth year in the White House, the poll found. Another two-thirds said that President Obama should seek \u201cbipartisan compromise when dealing with major issues, with just 30 percent advocating the President make unilateral changes.\u201d\n\nVENTURA\u2019S HIGHWAY\n\nFormer Minnesota governor and pro wrestler Jesse Ventura still eyes the big ring. The big political ring, that is.\n\n\u201cSome say if Jeb Bush ran against Hillary Clinton we would probably have a very good race, well thought-out, no backstabbing, good issues, two concerned bright Americans. What do you make of that?\u201d Larry King, host of the RT America\u2019s \u201cPoliticking\u201d show, asked Mr. Ventura in a broadcast airing Thursday on the network formerly known as Russia Today.\n\n\u201cIf Jeb Bush ends up against Hillary Clinton, that\u2019s going to pave the way for Jesse Ventura to be the next president,\u201d the man himself replied, later explaining, \u201cIf I run as an independent I will be a true independent The way public sentiment is right now, Larry \u2014 I mean I would run on this \u2014 I offer the people of America, I challenge them to elect the first president since George Washington, the father of our country, that doesn\u2019t belong to a political party. Imagine that. And I think the way it is today, you could win on that issue alone.\u201d\n\n\u201cMADAME SECRETARY\u201d\n\nInteresting timing. Twenty percent of Democratic lawmakers have already endorsed Hillary Rodham Clinton as a 2016 presidential hopeful, and a grassroots super PAC has already raised $4 million for her yet-to-be declared campaign. Now here comes a little Hollywood help, perhaps. CBS is now producing a TV pilot with the help of veteran actor Morgan Freeman titled \u201cMadame Secretary,\u201d a drama with all the trimmings.\n\nThe very attractive and tousled blonde actress Tea Leoni will star as the lead character in question \u2014 one Elizabeth Faulkner McGill, which has a nice Hillary Rodham Clinton sort of ring to it. Well, the syllables match, anyway. She plays a school teacher turned federal official.\n\nWell, OK.\n\n\u201cMadam Secretary centers on the personal and professional life of a maverick female Secretary of State as she drives international diplomacy, wrangles office politics and balances a complex family life,\u201d explains Lesley Goldberg, a correspondent for the Hollywood Reporter.\n\nSEXUAL POLITICS 101\n\n\u201cFeminist Perspectives: Politicizing Beyonc.\u201d\n\nBehold, this is a new spring semester course at Rutgers University\u2019s Department of Women\u2019s and Gender Studies.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t a course about Beyonc\u2019s political engagement or how many times she performed during President Obama\u2019s inauguration weekend,\u201d instructor Kevin Allred told Rutgers Today, a campus publication. \u201cRather, the performer\u2019s music and career are used as lenses to explore American race, gender, and sexual politics.\u201d\n\nPOLL DU JOUR\n\n\u2022 64 percent of Republican voters have a positive impression of former Arkansas Gov.
