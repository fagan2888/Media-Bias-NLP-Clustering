Oswalt & Sons, an 88-year-old Midlands company that got its start moving homes by rolling them atop logs out of the way of road construction, is embracing a new technology \u2014 drones \u2014 to entice customers to its heavy-duty cargo hauling business.\n\nOnline To see the drone videos of J.E. Oswalt & Sons moving oversized cargo, go to: tinyurl.com/of7s7pc tinyurl.com/k7d9bj7\n\nDavid Oswalt, owner of the Batesburg company, which moves cargo for customers to and from the Port of Charleston, decided on a whim in January to let friend James Player use a drone to film one of his company\u2019s trucks moving an oversized transformer along Lake Murray and through the town of Lexington. The roughly two-minute video was posted online in February and promoted in Oswalt\u2019s company newsletter.\n\nIt turned out to be a hit, at least in the trucking business. The video had more than 2,000 views in the first three weeks on the Truckers News website and is still drawing traffic. Oswalt has since posted another video of a truck moving a large tire manufacturing part, and plans more.\n\n\u201cThis is definitely giving us a lot more exposure than we ever dreamed,\u201d said Oswalt, the grandson of company founder Junior Earl Oswalt. \u201cIt has turned out to be a great advertising tool.\u201d\n\nOswalt said he has sent links to the video to customers, including utilities and manufacturers. \u201cThey\u2019re just blown away,\u201d he said. \u201cThey say, \u2018If you can do that move, ours will be a piece of cake\u2019.\u201d\n\nNike Kern, who handles public relations for Oswalt\u2019s firm, said Oswalt filmed the moves \u201cto illustrate to his clientele how a move is instrumented, the difficulty involved, safety standards that are used and the professionalism needed to take on such a move.\u201d\n\nOne of Oswalt\u2019s top customers is General Electric, which makes gas turbine generators at its Greenville plant. Oswalt said he moved 102 generators last year, and the product is one of the top exports at the Charleston port with $1.7 billion in export sales last year.\n\nCall him skeptical\n\nJim Newsome, president and CEO of the State Ports Authority, isn\u2019t buying the news that shipping companies plan to switch en masse to East Coast ports because of the labor strife that, until recently, shut down their West Coast counterparts.\n\n\u201cIf you believe what you read, there\u2019s going to be a lot of changes,\u201d Newsome said last week during the SPA\u2019s monthly board of directors meeting. \u201cMy sense tells me that there\u2019ll be some changes, but those changes were going to occur anyway.\u201d\n\nNewsome said some shippers from Asia already have plans to dock along the East Coast once expansion of the Panama Canal is finished next year and larger vessels can maneuver the waterway. \u201cWhen big ships can come by the Panama Canal, it makes more sense economically to bring cargo to the East Coast closer to where most people need it,\u201d he said.\n\nHowever, much of the talk in recent weeks about labor problems causing a shift is simply an \u201cemotional, angry reaction to a bad situation.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe all the hype about everybody\u2019s going to change,\u201d Newsome said. \u201cPeople have distribution systems worked out that aren\u2019t changeable overnight.\u201d\n\nSeat setback\n\nOngoing problems with the France-based manufacturer of seats for the Boeing Co.\u2019s 787 Dreamliner could force new delays in deliveries of the twin-aisle commercial airplane to customers, according to a report by Reuters.\n\nZodiac Aerospace says it continues to miss deadlines for seat production, and a Boeing executive told Reuters the supplier \u201covercommitted\u201d on its ability to build seats fast enough.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t just point to one thing: the business took off on (them) and (they) didn\u2019t have the capability,\u201d said Pat Shanahan, Boeing\u2019s senior vice president of airplane programs.\n\nThe delays forced Boeing to move the delivery date for American Airlines\u2019 first Dreamliner from November to earlier this year. Boeing builds the Dreamliners at its campus in North Charleston and in Everett. Wash.\n\nZodiac\u2019s troubles \u2014 blamed in part on a strike last fall at the company\u2019s Texas plant \u2014 also are affecting Boeing competitor Airbus. Both manufacturers have held what one source described as \u201ctough\u201d meetings with Zodiac\u2019s leadership, Reuters reported.\n\nZodiac reported last week that the seat problems will have a significant impact on its operating income for the first half of this fiscal year.\n\nReach David Wren at 937-5550 or on Twitter at @David_Wren_", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Trucking firm using drones to drum up business, Boeing/Aerospace, \r\nBoeing/AerospaceBusiness-Local, \r\nIndustry, \r\nFP LatestNews, \r\nDavid Wren, \r\nDavid Wren, 787,Airbus,Boeing,Dreamliner,J.E.
