(AP Photo/Mark J. Terrill)\n\nCritics and even some allies in recent days have criticized Donald Trump\u2019s increasing use of profanity on the stump, but language experts contend the constant cursing isn\u2019t hurting the billionaire with much of the American public \u2014 instead, it\u2019s more likely a key part of his appeal.\n\nMichael Adams, an English professor at Indiana University and author of \u201cSlang: The People\u2019s Poetry,\u201d told InsideSources Trump\u2019s unfiltered speech is reflective of the way Americans talk today, not 20 or 30 years ago.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know whether it\u2019s deliberate or natural for him, but it is a sort of linguistic populism \u2026 a way to speak to a population that feels connected to the candidate because the candidate uses his or her language, the language of the people.\u201d\n\nIn just one speech on Thursday in New Hampshire, the Republican presidential front runner told cheering supporters that he would \u201cbomb the shit\u201d out of the Islamic State, that \u201cAfghanistan is going to hell,\u201d and that, on trade with China and Mexico, he would \u201ckick their asses.\u201d\n\nAs the billionaire developer finished with a silent F-bomb (another profanity he\u2019s shown no qualms about using in the past), the crowd chanted \u201cTrump! Trump! Trump!\u201d\n\nThe profane language on the stump has drawn fire from more traditional GOP candidates in the field, including Jeb Bush, the son on one president and brother of another.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think a president would have ever shouted profanities in a speech in front of thousands of people with kids in the crowd,\u201d Bush said. \u201cHe does it all the time.\u201d\n\nOhio Gov. John Kasich chided Trump: \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t use that kind of language. My wife told me one time, when I became governor, she said you\u2019re the father of Ohio, act like it.\u201d\n\nEven Fox News\u2019 Bill O\u2019Reilly, who calls Trump a friend, said the blue language is inappropriate: \u201cAdvice to Trump: Using profanity on campaign trail is not presidential. Most use it, including me, but we are not running for [president],\u201d O\u2019Reilly tweeted Friday.\n\nBut linguists who study the way Americans curse say that in a culture more saturated than ever with blunt language \u2014 from Martin Scorcese films to HBO series to pop music lyrics and uncensored tweets \u2014 Trump isn\u2019t breaking new ground. He\u2019s simply reflecting a new norm.\n\nJesse Sheidlower, author of \u201cThe F Word,\u201d said cultural definitions of what is or is not taboo shift \u2014 sometimes dramatically \u2014 over time.\n\n\u201cThe traditional offensive vocabulary of sexual and scatological language is much more common now, in both a pop cultural context and in a general context,\u201d the former president of the American Dialect Society told InsideSources.\n\n\u201cThe kinds of things that we take offense at, those have also changed. Sexual and scatological terms are really not a big deal now. Certain religious terms \u2026 like \u2018God damn\u2019 or \u2018hell,\u2019 which 200 years ago would have been extremely offensive, now bother fewer people. At the same time, the use of any sort of racial or ethnic term would be considered much, much worse than it ever was.\u201d\n\nIndiana University\u2019s Adams, whose latest book, \u201cIn Praise of Profanity,\u201d is to be published later this year, said the acknowledgement of profanity in American culture is healthy.\n\n\u201cThat honesty about the relationship between language and culture is probably good.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s always been plenty of profanity in politics, we\u2019ve known that. We know that Harry S. Truman was a salty talker. That lowered him in some people\u2019s estimation, but what happens now is that we can hear more of that profanity than we used to.\u201d\n\nAdams cites Dick Cheney telling Patrick Leahy after a 2004 argument in the Capitol to \u201cFuck yourself,\u201d and Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s off-the-cuff aside, \u201cThis is a big fucking deal,\u201d when President Barack Obama signed the Affordable Care Act, as examples of politicians using profanity behind the scenes to communicate in straight-forward, unambiguous language.\n\nLike Cheney and Biden, Trump is using the language of average Americans, Adams said. What\u2019s different is Trump is doing so publicly.\n\n\u201cI think frankly that in some ways that\u2019s good because what we\u2019re doing is \u2018de-vulgarizing\u2019 the language, he said. \u201cWhile it\u2019s natural to think of language levels in relation to class, I\u2019m a little uncomfortable with pejorative senses of vulgar and the connections that people draw, say, between low socioeconomic status and profanity or race and profanity.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019d be great if we just got class out of the linguistic picture. In part, that\u2019s what\u2019s been happening. People have no longer been using profanity as a means of marking social low from social high. There\u2019s a type of democratizing that goes on.\u201d\n\nPop culture, Adams said, hasn\u2019t changed the way Americans talk, it\u2019s just doing a more honest job of capturing real speech.\n\n\u201cInevitably, HBO had to be the network of television profanity because people weren\u2019t going to allow televisual representations of life any longer without profanity in it. Because profanity is part of life.\u201d\n\nAdams said it\u2019s a mistake to dismiss political profanity as nothing more than angry rhetoric.\n\n\u201cAnother part of the message for Trump is that, \u2018I can talk to you this way, we have a relationship in which I can drop all the barriers and talk to you this way.\u2019 I know this sounds really counter-intuitive, but we use profanity to create bonds and sometimes even intimacy. So a politician can trade on that mixed message.\u201d\n\nThe professor, 54, adds that it\u2019s clear there\u2019s a gender bias when it comes to swearing \u2014 meaning that what works for Trump might not work, say, for Hillary Clinton, the Democratic presidential front runner. Trumpwas was criticized last year when he said Clinton, in her 2008 bid for the nomination, \u201cgot schlonged,\u201d creating a verb from a Yiddish slang word for penis.\n\n\u201cThink about the swearing that goes on in the boardroom and the locker room and how you build solidarity with other people,\u201d Adams said. \u201cI think girls are excluded because they\u2019re not speaking the same language sometimes.\u201d\n\nThat double-standard and Trump\u2019s willingness to \u201ccall \u2019em like he sees \u2019em\u201d creates a potential advantage, Adams said. \u201cI would argue that in many cases, there is no other way to say what you mean than by using profanity.\u201d\n\nBullfeathers, says Madonna Hanna, a retired Bremerton, Washington, teacher who spent years admonishing her high schoolers to \u201cDare Not to Swear.\u201d Hanna, 62, stills works as a \u201ccivility consultant,\u201d lecturing corporate audiences on the anti-profanity campaign that brought national attention to her classroom a decade ago.\n\nHanna said she cringes every time she hears Trump\u2019s foul language.\n\n\u201cI know darn well, as well as you do \u2026 we\u2019ve had a breakdown. We have a couple of generations of kids who think that it is OK to swear,\u201d Hanna said \u2014 and profane language on the campaign trail just makes it more difficult for parents and teachers to teach children basic good manners.\n\n\u201cDonald Trump is a grown man, but he should not be using profanity in a public forum. It\u2019s not correct. What he says in the boardroom, what kind of language he wants to use around his own folks to motivate them, to do what he needs to get done, that\u2019s one thing,\u201d she told InsideSources. \u201cBut when you use profanity like that and it\u2019s going out on CNN and everywhere, in that instance he is not being a good role model for young people.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Critics and even some allies in recent days have criticized Donald Trump\u2019s increasing\u00a0use of profanity on the stump, but language experts contend the const", "og": {"site_name": "InsideSources", "description": "Critics and even some allies in recent days have criticized Donald Trump\u2019s increasing\u00a0use of profanity on the stump, but language experts contend the const", "title": "Unpresidential Profanity: The Reason Trump Doesn\u2019t Give a Damn \u2013 InsideSources", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://www.insidesources.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/AP_965322428280.jpg", "url": "http://www.insidesources.com/unpresidential-profanity-trump-doesnt-give-a-damn/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Critics and even some allies in recent days have criticized Donald Trump\u2019s increasing\u00a0use of profanity on the stump, but language experts contend the const", "creator": "@InsideSourcesDC", "image": "http://www.insidesources.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/AP_965322428280.jpg", "title": "Unpresidential Profanity: The Reason Trump Doesn\u2019t Give a Damn \u2013 InsideSources", "site": "@InsideSourcesDC", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.insidesources.com", "section": "Politics", "tag": "The F Word", "published_time": "2016-02-08T09:14:45+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "\u201cDonald Trump is a grown man, but he should not be using profanity in a public forum.\nPeople have no longer been using profanity as a means of marking social low from social high.\nLike Cheney and Biden, Trump is using the language of average Americans, Adams said.\nCertain religious terms \u2026 like \u2018God damn\u2019 or \u2018hell,\u2019 which 200 years ago would have been extremely offensive, now bother fewer people.\nJohn Kasich chided Trump: \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t use that kind of language."}
