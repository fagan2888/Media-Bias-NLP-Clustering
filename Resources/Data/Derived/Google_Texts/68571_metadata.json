Peyton Manning will throw for 300 yards, and the running game, with RH-positive and C.J., will produce 130 yards. The defense will get four sacks and three turnovers and hold Detroit to one touchdown. There were be no roar of the Lions or the crowd.\n\nManning will be 2-0 in Detroit, 4-0 vs. the Lions and keep intact his career winning percentage of 75 in domed stadiums.\n\nThe weather will be 72 degrees inside (dome) and outside, and the artificial turf is perfect for the quick, athletic Broncos defense and wide receivers Emmanuel Sanders and Demaryius Thomas, and the running of Ronnie Hillman \u2014 the RH factor.\n\nThe Lions\u2019 offensive line is worse than the Broncos\u2019 and Detroit\u2019s defense is missing three interior linemen (especially Ndamukong Suh) from last year. Matthew Stafford should have been listed on the medical reports as \u201cbanged up.\u201d He, not Manning, is Pro Football Focus\u2019 lowest-rated passer (minus-7.9). Calvin Johnson is not playing against shrubbery.\n\nAny questions?\n\nYes, I know the one. Peyton is not on life support, notwithstanding the endless drivel on social media and even in Denver. Despite the recommendation from a flannel shirt-wearing New England sportswriter, Peyton didn\u2019t retire Wednesday.\n\nI\u2019d rather trust a former NFL quarterback, Peyton\u2019s confidant and the patriarch of the Manning Football Family.\n\n\u201cPeyton will be fine,\u201d says dad Archie. \u201cWe knew it would take some time with the changes in the offense. The Broncos are getting it fixed.\u201d\n\nThe younger Manning \u2014 Peyton is only 39; his father is 66 \u2014 threw for three \u2014 count \u2019em \u2014 three touchdowns, 256 yards and one interception in the victory over the Chiefs.\n\n(He threw for six touchdowns in his only other appearance in Detroit.)\n\nAgainst K.C., Manning led a fourth-quarterback comeback that cumulated in a tying touchdown. The Broncos, waiting for overtime, won on a fumble return seconds later.\n\nAccording to the Elias Sports Bureau, it was the first time an NFL team had two touchdowns, the second the go-ahead score, in the final minute since Atlanta beat New Orleans on Nov. 12, 1978.\n\nThe losing quarterback then was Archie Manning.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know about that. I wish you hadn\u2019t told me,\u201d Archie said Saturday afternoon by phone from Oxford, Miss., where he was primed for his alma mater\u2019s game against Vanderbilt.\n\nArchie is in a festive mood these days, after both his quarterbacking sons had been criticized severely early this season. The New York Giants\u2019 Eli Manning suffered a mental burp in the defeat against the Dallas Cowboys, and Peyton had been portrayed as The Old Man and The I-N-T. But the Broncos are 2-0 \u2014 Archie was in Denver for the Broncos\u2019 opener \u2014 and Eli played extremely well in the Giants\u2019 victory Thursday night.\n\nAnd Archie\u2019s Ole Miss Rebels pulled off a major upset over Alabama to ascend to third in the college power rankings.\n\nIn regard to the Broncos\u2019 offensive line woes that made Peyton Manning vulnerable, Archie said: \u201cThey need to fix that, but Gary Kubiak is a very good coach, and I think you\u2019ll see improvement in Detroit. It\u2019s not as bad as some people are making it out to be. I try to stay away from offering advice, but Peyton\u2019s healthy and confident. He\u2019s still got a lot to accomplish.\u201d\n\nLike another Super Bowl championship.\n\nArchie will rejoin his son in Indianapolis for a rather important game. There\u2019s a chance Peyton will set the record for all-time regular-season victories (187) against the Colts.\n\nPeyton has an uprising for No. 182 on Sunday, and Paige is upgrading Monday.\n\nWoody Paige: woody@woodypaige.com or @woodypaige", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Paige: Broncos\u2019 Horsepower will roar in Motor City", "title": "Paige: Broncos\u2019 Horsepower will roar in Motor City", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/09/26/paige-broncos-horsepower-will-roar-in-motor-city/", "image": {"width": 512, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg", "height": 512}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2015-09-26T18:24:23+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-05-23T02:09:51+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Woody Paige"}, "article_summary": "Peyton Manning will throw for 300 yards, and the running game, with RH-positive and C.J., will produce 130 yards.\nBut the Broncos are 2-0 \u2014 Archie was in Denver for the Broncos\u2019 opener \u2014 and Eli played extremely well in the Giants\u2019 victory Thursday night.\nBefore a crowd of 21,228 at the old University of Denver Hilltop Stadium, the Broncos prevailed 13-7.\nThe losing quarterback then was Archie Manning.\nThe Lions are 30th in overall defense, the Broncos No."}
