We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard ...\u201d\n\n\u2014 President John F. Kennedy, Sept. 12, 1962\n\nWhere were you on July 20, 1969, if you were anywhere at all?\n\nThat\u2019s the question former astronaut Edwin \u201cBuzz\u201d Aldrin posed on social media, leading up to today\u2019s 45th anniversary of the epic walk on the moon by Neil Armstrong and Aldrin, the first earthling boots to make tracks on the moon\u2019s surface. \u201cThe whole world celebrated our moon landing,\u201d Aldrin beams on an Internet video, \u201cbut we missed the whole thing because we were out of town.\u201d\n\nBut there is no need to ask native Iowan Steve Bales where he was. Bales, as Aldrin knows, and as the late Neil Armstrong knew, played a critical role in the safe lunar landing.\n\nBales graduated from high school in Fremont, his father a school janitor, his mother a beautician. He first caught space-travel fever in 1956, when he watched a \u201cWonderful World of Disney\u201d TV show on space exploration. Which is logical. After all, Disney\u2019s go-to song, as warbled by Jiminy Cricket, went:\n\nWhen you wish upon a star\n\nMakes no difference who you are\n\nAnything your heart desires\n\nWill come to you\n\nBales went to Iowa State University and earned a degree in aerospace engineering. He landed a job at NASA in 1964, one month after graduating from Iowa State, and worked his way up to NASA guidance officer.\n\nHe was at NASA\u2019s Mission Control in 1969 when Apollo 11, with third astronaut Michael Collins piloting the command module, circled the moon. It was time for the lunar module, with Aldrin and Armstrong aboard, to split from the command ship and power-descend to the moon for the historic landing.\n\nAs the lunar module drifted toward the moon\u2019s surface, bad things happened. The spacecraft moved faster than it should and it approached its abort limits.\n\n\u201cIt lasted about 13 minutes,\u201d Bales, 71, said last week from his New Jersey home. \u201cThe entire 13 minutes passed so fast, and yet I think every flight controller on duty that day could tell you about every second of the experience. Have you ever been in a car wreck and yet can remember just about everything that happened? It was like that.\u201d\n\nYet, the young Bales \u2014 he was just 26 \u2014 stayed glued to the data, kept his eyes on the control panel screen and remained cool. On his recommendation the mission was deemed still doable. Still go.\n\nThen more trouble. In the last few minutes before touchdown, guidance computer alarms flashed. The computers seemed overloaded. Now it was an 11th-hour, 59th-minute decision. Abort or proceed?\n\n\u201cMy first words after sorting out the problem and making a decision \u2014 took about 15 seconds, which is a lifetime during powered descent \u2014 were \u2018Flight we are GO on that alarm.\u2019 \u201d A co-worker had instantly heard and recognized the alarm and said the warning was passable.\n\nMinutes later, the Eagle had landed on lunar dust and American astronauts were standing on it.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind,\u201d Armstrong said, climbing down the lunar module ladder.\n\nIt was a day Earth stood still. Television viewers around the world \u2014 at least those who didn\u2019t think the whole event was a Hollywood-staged hoax \u2014 were moonstruck, transfixed by grainy, black-and-white images of man tromping on the moon.\n\nEven normally stoic TV anchor Walter Cronkite, America\u2019s most-trusted news uncle, was giddy. \u201cGo, baby, go!\u201d he shouted on air as Apollo 11 launched from Earth.\n\nFor sure, it was a different time. America, determined to catch and lap the Soviet Union in the Cold War era, hailed astronauts as rock stars. And why not? As Tom Wolfe, author of \u201cThe Right Stuff,\u201d asked: \u201cWhat is it that makes a man willing to sit up on top of an enormous Roman candle, such as a Redstone, Atlas, Titan or Saturn rocket, and wait for someone to light the fuse?\u201d\n\nStill, rock stars don\u2019t roll without roadies like Steve Bales, the techies behind stage.\n\nBales and his wife, Sandra, now run a chemical company, Lord\u2019s Additives. He said they would attend church today and then spend a quiet Sunday at their home. He seldom thinks about that historic day on the moon, he says.\n\nBut every Iowa school should tell the story of Steve Bales, a small-town Iowan who came up big. Not just to report what he did, but to remind us of what can be done.\n\nNext time you look to the moon, offer a salute to Steve Bales. He\u2019s one of us, and he helped put us up there.\n\nTHE AUTHOR:\n\nRICK JOST is a wire service editor for Gannett Co. in Des Moines. He is a former Des Moines Register business editor.
