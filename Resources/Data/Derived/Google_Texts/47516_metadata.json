A hearing is set for March 7 in Washington, D.C.\n\nThe League of Women Voters and other voting rights group contend the timing of commission director Brian Newby\u2019s actions jeopardizes several upcoming federal elections. The groups argue the requirements hurt their ability to conduct voter registration drives and deprive eligible voters of the right to vote in federal elections.\n\nAlabama\u2019s primary election is March 1, although its deadline for registration for it has passed. Kansas has its caucuses on March 5, and the Democratic Party allows voter registration on the day of its caucus. The registration deadline for Georgia\u2019s March 1 presidential primary election has passed, but April 26 is the registration deadline for state and local primary elections.\n\nNewby granted the states\u2019 request to change the federal form\u2019s state-specific instructions.\n\nThe government noted in its filing that when Congress enacted the National Voting Registration Act it considered and specifically rejected requiring proof-of-citizenship documents when registering to vote.\n\nKansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach has intervened in the lawsuit on Newby\u2019s behalf.\n\nNewby, who took the top job at the EAC in November, is a former Kansas election official who had been appointed to his state job by Kobach. As a Kansas official, Newby had publicly supported the state\u2019s efforts to modify the federal form.\n\nKansas submitted its fifth request to change the federal form two weeks after Newby\u2019s appointment as the EAC\u2019s executive director.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "News, Local, State, Legislature, Roxana Hegeman", "og": {"site_name": "CJOnline.com", "description": "WICHITA - The federal Justice Department has refused to support a U.S. elections official who sided with Kansas, Alabama and Georgia in a fight over whether voters should have to show proof of citizenship when registering using a national form.", "title": "Federal government not backing own official on Kansas voter citizenship ruling", "url": "http://cjonline.com/news/2016-02-23/federal-government-not-backing-own-official-kansas-voter-citizenship-ruling", "image": "http://cjonline.com/sites/default/files/lead_photo/AP_994452904875.jpg", "type": "article"}, "description": "WICHITA \u2014 The federal Justice Department has refused to support a U.S. elections official who sided with Kansas, Alabama and Georgia in a fight over whether voters should have to show proof of citizenship when registering using a national form.The government conceded in a court filing that the executive director of the U.S. Election Assistance Commission and his agency cannot win the lawsuit on its merits because he never determined, as required by the National Voter Registration Act, that the documents were \u201cnecessary\u201d to determine the eligibility of voters."}, "article_summary": "Kansas has its caucuses on March 5, and the Democratic Party allows voter registration on the day of its caucus.\nAs a Kansas official, Newby had publicly supported the state\u2019s efforts to modify the federal form.\nThe groups argue the requirements hurt their ability to conduct voter registration drives and deprive eligible voters of the right to vote in federal elections.\nNewby, who took the top job at the EAC in November, is a former Kansas election official who had been appointed to his state job by Kobach.\nKansas submitted its fifth request to change the federal form two weeks after Newby\u2019s appointment as the EAC\u2019s executive director."}
