Covered California, the state’s Obamacare exchange, wants you to “Give the Gift of Health” this holiday season.

The exchange has put up a new webpage that provides users with several ways to give the gift. Options include:

Sending loved ones a pre-written email “telling them you care and want to make sure they have health coverage.”

Printing a pledge certificate (shown below) to present to your loved ones “as a symbol of your willingness to help them get insured.”

Obtaining a list of “tips for starting a discussion with friends and family about the importance of having health insurance.”

The exchange also suggests that family members or friends “may choose to help young adults by paying for a month or more of their insurance premium.”

Covered California says it will partner with community-based organizations and other Obamacare advocates to promote the “Give the Gift of Health” campaign through email blasts and social media in English and Spanish.
