Donelon has put Billy Bostick in charge of managing the CO-OP.

A state court in Louisiana has issued an order giving Louisiana Insurance Commissioner, Jim Donelon, authority to put Louisiana Health Cooperative in rehabilitation.

The nonprofit, member-owned insurer, which was organized with a $56 million loan from the Consumer Operated and Oriented Plan (CO-OP) program, announced plans in July to wind down operations by the end of 2015.
