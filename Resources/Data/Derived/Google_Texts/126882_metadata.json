Such boards typically are composed of company executives and government-relations staff. PACs can donate up to $5,000 per election to any candidate.\n\nLast month's fight widened a split between Republican lawmakers associated with the grassroots Tea Party movement and the party's more pragmatic business allies.\n\nSome business groups are now mulling an effort to push the most uncompromising Tea Partiers out of office in next year's congressional elections.\n\nBut many of the PACs of the biggest corporate players appear reluctant to punish lawmakers who, if they had prevailed in the Oct. 16 vote, could have pushed the United States into default. Many of those lawmakers are in a position to push regulations or new laws that could affect their operations.\n\n\"What you're seeing is the natural tension between the interests of a publicly held company to its shareholders ... and the desire of the people that may be running that company to want some kind of fundamental change in the way we do politics,\" said Steve Bell, a former Republican staffer now with the Bipartisan Policy Center.\n\nGOVERNANCE VS. CORPORATE GOVERNANCE\n\nLast month's confrontation pushed those tensions to the fore.\n\nAs Republicans said they would not raise the debt ceiling and keep the government open without concessions from the Obama administration, business leaders like Honeywell CEO David Cote urged them to step away from the fight.\n\n\"Don't throw away a credit history that's been built up since George Washington,\" Cote said at a news conference at the end of September, three days before the shutdown took effect.\n\nBut Cote's company, a sprawling conglomerate that makes everything from helicopter electronics to thermostats, has more practical concerns as well.\n\nThe company earned $2.4 billion from federal contracts in the 2012 fiscal year. It has spent $4.11 million on lobbying this year - not an unusual amount for a large company - on subjects as varied as nuclear power, corporate tax reform, and financial regulations.\n\nHoneywell also runs the biggest PAC in the United States, contributing $1.17 million to federal candidates through the end of September, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Republicans have collected 58 percent of that money.\n\nThose contributions at times undercut the message from Cote, who is a member of a group of business leaders and politicians called Fix the Debt that has campaigned in Washington for a long-term, bipartisan solution to the country's debt.\n\nThree days after he urged lawmakers to find common ground, Honeywell donated $2,500 to Georgia Representative Tom Graves, who had led a successful effort by rank-and-file Republicans to reject a compromise supported by party leaders.\n\nHoneywell did not urge Graves to change his stance, a spokesman for the congressman said.\n\nHoneywell did not significantly change its giving patterns after the crisis was resolved. At the end of October, the company contributed $43,000 to Democrats and Republicans who voted to end the shutdown, and $8,000 to Republicans who voted against the deal.\n\n\"Our political action committee supports those who support the policies that are most important to our business and that are good for the economic growth of the country,\" the company said in a prepared statement.\n\nThe second-largest corporate PAC, operated by defense contractor Northrop Grumman, contributed $14,500 to Republicans who voted against the Oct. 16 deal. Northrop spokesman Randy Beloite said it supports lawmakers who oversee national security and represent areas where the company operates or has a large number of employees. Political affiliation is not a factor, he said.\n\nLockheed Martin, another large defense contractor, donated $914,000 to federal candidates through September of this year but made no contributions in October. The company declined to comment.\n\nUPS, which contributed $5,750 to lawmakers who opposed the deal and $20,690 to those who supported it, said the Oct. 16 vote was not a factor.\n\nThe American Bankers Association gave $9,000 to those who opposed the deal and $17,000 to those who backed it. \"When it comes time to determine whether to continue contributions to any incumbent, we'll do so in a thoughtful and deliberative manner,\" spokesman Jeff Sigmund said.\n\nOf the other PACs analyzed:\n\n- AT&T contributed $13,000 to lawmakers who voted against the deal, and $47,000 to those who backed it;\n\n- Deloitte gave $23,000 to opponents and $30,500 to supporters;\n\n- New York Life gave $2,000 to opponents and $16,000 to supporters;\n\n- General Electric gave $9,500 to opponents and $23,500 to supporters.\n\nNone of those companies responded to a request for comment.
