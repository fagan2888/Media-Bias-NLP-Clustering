But Obama\u2019s style is different. As we\u2019ve learned after nearly five years, he\u2019s more cautious and deliberative.\n\nBasically, the president is mirroring the American public\u2019s split personality. He wants to lead but he wants to listen, too. He wants to end wars but also to intervene militarily. He wants to stay out of the Syrian war and also support the opposition. To resolve this confusion, he proposes an inductive kind of leadership: As he read from people\u2019s letters Tuesday, it sounded almost like government by focus group.\n\nHow does a president who wants to be a liberal internationalist rally the United States to enforce norms against chemical weapons? Obama\u2019s answer has been to conduct a kind of public experiment: Instead of acting unilaterally as commander in chief, he has asked a divided Congress for counsel. Predictably, this has produced a cacophony, and Obama \u2014 despite a strong speech Tuesday night \u2014 is accused of playing both sides.\n\nLook behind the White House veil and here\u2019s what you see: The president correctly believes that in the aftermath of Iraq and Afghanistan, the country is sick of war and mistrustful of politicians. The traditional centre ground on which foreign policy is made (\u201cpolitics stops at the water\u2019s edge\u201d) has disappeared. The left and right are equally suspicious of foreign entanglements.\n\nWASHINGTON\u2014What is President Barack Obama doing with his bob-and-weave Syria policy that seemingly bounces between bombing and diplomacy in the space of 15 minutes? The answer tells us some worrying things about the breakdown of America\u2019s old foreign-policy consensus and Obama\u2019s difficulty creating a new one.\n\nThe public focus on Obama\u2019s decision-making has obscured something perhaps more important, which is the breakdown of bipartisan foreign policy. Instead of converging in the centre around American leadership, the country seems to be converging at the wings, in a shared left-right rejection of the traditional interventionist role. The public overwhelmingly rejects more \u201cwars of choice\u201d in the Middle East to help nations and people who are seen as feckless and ungrateful.\n\nYou can think this new American caution is potentially dangerous (as I do), but there\u2019s no arguing that it\u2019s deeply felt and (given the immense cost and almost nonexistent benefits of Iraq and Afghanistan) understandable. The question is what a president should do about it.\n\nObama has been trying to reconstruct a basis for action. He took a principled and unpopular stand in favour of military intervention in Syria. He then deferred to Congress, sensing that he couldn\u2019t take the country into conflict without more support. Some argue that he should have just rolled the dice and fired the missiles, but that\u2019s not the way the United States is supposed to work. And, even after turning to Congress, he still convinced the Russians and Syrians that he was prepared to act.\n\nObama displays such a peculiar combination of traits as president that I turned last week to an unlikely source for illumination. It\u2019s a The Garments of Court and Palacenew book by Columbia law professor Philip Bobbitt about Machiavelli called The Garments of Court and Palace. Bobbitt\u2019s argument is that for all his supposed ruthlessness and amorality, Machiavelli was actually proposing rules that would allow a prince to govern in a decisive but sustainable way \u2014 with what amounted to constitutional order. This book convinces me that to succeed, Obama must become Bobbitt\u2019s neo-Machiavellian.\n\nHere\u2019s a famous passage that Bobbitt quotes from The Prince, which Obama should commit to memory: \u201cBecause . . . a prince must sometimes practice the ways of beasts, he should choose from among them the fox and the lion, for while the lion cannot defend himself from traps, the fox cannot protect himself from wolves. It is therefore necessary to be a fox in order to recognize traps, and a lion in order to frighten wolves.\u201d\n\nObama does the fox thing pretty well. He recognizes traps and generally avoids them. But he needs more lion. This means bold policy \u2014 diplomacy backed by threat of military force. To succeed in reframing U.S. power, Obama will need to frighten the wolves on Capitol Hill and the Kremlin. Otherwise, they will devour what\u2019s left of his presidency.\n\nObama\u2019s penchant for avoiding big, risky bets in uncertain situations may also be neo-Machiavellian, in Bobbitt\u2019s terms. The phrase \u201cthe end justifies the means\u201d is often attributed incorrectly to Machiavelli. Properly translated, argues Bobbitt, the advice to the prince is: \u201cOne must consider the outcome.\u201d\n\nDavid Ignatius is a Washington Post columnist. davidignatius@washpost.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "To succeed in reframing U.S. power, Obama will need to frighten the wolves on Capitol Hill and the Kremlin.", "og": {"site_name": "thestar.com", "description": "To succeed in reframing U.S. power, Obama will need to frighten the wolves on Capitol Hill and the Kremlin.", "title": "Machiavellian advice for Barack Obama on Syria  | Toronto Star", "url": "https://www.thestar.com/opinion/commentary/2013/09/14/machiavellian_advice_for_barack_obama_on_syria.html", "image": "https://www.thestar.com/content/dam/thestar/opinion/commentary/2013/09/14/machiavellian_advice_for_barack_obama_on_syria/machiavelli.jpg", "type": "article"}, "parsely-link": "https://www.thestar.com/opinion/commentary/2013/09/14/machiavellian_advice_for_barack_obama_on_syria.html", "twitter": {"description": "To succeed in reframing U.S. power, Obama will need to frighten the wolves on Capitol Hill and the Kremlin.", "creator": "David Ignatius", "image": "https://www.thestar.com/content/dam/thestar/opinion/commentary/2013/09/14/machiavellian_advice_for_barack_obama_on_syria/machiavelli.jpg", "title": "Machiavellian advice for Barack Obama on Syria  | Toronto Star", "site": "@TorontoStar", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "parsely-image-url": "https://www.thestar.com/content/dam/thestar/opinion/commentary/2013/09/14/machiavellian_advice_for_barack_obama_on_syria/machiavelli.jpg.size.xxsmall.promo.jpg", "bt": {"pubDate": 1379203200000, "author": "David Ignatius", "url": "https://www.thestar.com/opinion/commentary/2013/09/14/machiavellian_advice_for_barack_obama_on_syria.html", "dateDisplay": "Sat., Sept. 14, 2013", "modDate": 1379203202132, "type": "Story", "id": "eb7ecc1a-d131-4cab-92d0-0c503d90a406"}, "parsely-title": "Machiavellian advice for Barack Obama on Syria", "parsely-tags": "Niccolo Machiavelli, Syria, Philip Bobbitt, President Barack Obama", "parsely-author": "David Ignatius", "parsely-section": "Commentary", "keywords": "Niccolo Machiavelli, Syria, Philip Bobbitt, President Barack Obama", "parsely-type": "post", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/torontostar", "section": "Commentary", "modified": "2013-09-14", "published": "2013-09-14"}, "parsely-pub-date": "2013-09-15T00:00:00.000Z", "genre": "News Analysis", "thumbnail": "https://www.thestar.com/content/dam/thestar/opinion/commentary/2013/09/14/machiavellian_advice_for_barack_obama_on_syria/machiavelli.jpg.size.xxsmall.promo.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=2.0, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Niccolo Machiavelli, Syria, Philip Bobbitt, President Barack Obama"}, "article_summary": "WASHINGTON\u2014What is President Barack Obama doing with his bob-and-weave Syria policy that seemingly bounces between bombing and diplomacy in the space of 15 minutes?\nHere\u2019s a famous passage that Bobbitt quotes from The Prince, which Obama should commit to memory: \u201cBecause .\nPredictably, this has produced a cacophony, and Obama \u2014 despite a strong speech Tuesday night \u2014 is accused of playing both sides.\nProperly translated, argues Bobbitt, the advice to the prince is: \u201cOne must consider the outcome.\u201dDavid Ignatius is a Washington Post columnist.\nObama displays such a peculiar combination of traits as president that I turned last week to an unlikely source for illumination."}
