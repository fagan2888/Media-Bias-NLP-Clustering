Debicella lost that election by about six percentage points.\n\nHe\u2019s running again in a midterm election that may favor the GOP, but analysts say he\u2019s a clear underdog.\n\n\u201cUnless this is a true \u2018wave\u2019 election, I would expect Himes to be favored,\u201d said Ron Schurin, a University of Connecticut political science professor.\n\nThe Cook Political Report rates the race \u201csolid Democratic\u201d and says Himes will win by at least 5 percentage points.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t look for a competitive race here in 2014,\u201d it says.\n\nStill, Debicella has raised nearly $800,000 in the first six months of this year and hopes to raise at least $2 million. If he reaches his goal, he\u2019ll have a war chest Himes can\u2019t ignore.\n\nDebicella\u2019s supporters also hope the candidacy of Republican gubernatorial candidate Tom Foley, who is popular in the 4th District, will help drive Republicans to the polls in the mid-term election, which are notorious for low voter turnout.\n\nThe Debicella campaign has been running ads since June, hoping to raise the candidate\u2019s name recognition.\n\nIn his first ad, titled \u201cMessy,\u201d Debicella portrays himself as a problem-solver who can clean up a mess his young son has made \u2013 and also scrub up Washington.\n\nThe GOP challenger is also positioning himself as a moderate in a district that has been represented by a number of Republican moderates in the past, including Lowell Weicker, Stewart McKinney and Chris Shays, whom Himes defeated in 2008.\n\nDebicella supports abortion rights and gay marriage, following a Connecticut GOP tradition of being a mainstream Republican on fiscal issues and a liberal on social issues.\n\nBut Debicella says he embraces Democratic ideas on a range of other issues, from taxes to health care.\n\nWhile he joins the GOP majority in saying the Affordable Care Act should be scrapped, he differs from most other Republicans in supporting government subsidies to the poor so they can afford private insurance. He also blames both Democrats and Republicans \"for screwing up health care\" and criticizes the House GOP for dozens of votes to repeal all or parts of the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\"Voting 40 times to repeal ObamaCare is a waste of time, especially without offering an alternative,\" his campaign web site says.\n\nDebicella agrees with the majority of his party that tax reform should include a reduction in business taxes, but says there should also be incentives for businesses to hire and re-train the long-term unemployed, as many Democrats argue.\n\nDebicella also breaks with many in the GOP in talking about the disparate impact of the recession on the 4th District, which is home to the very wealthy and has pockets of poverty and a struggling middle class.\n\n\u201cFolks who either don\u2019t have a job or families who are dependent on a single income are really struggling,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople are hungry for new ideas.\u201d\n\nTo burnish his moderate credentials, Debicella asked former Massachusetts Sen. Scott Brown, a Republican who sometimes voted with Democrats and is now running for a New Hampshire U.S. Senate seat, to campaign for him.\n\n\u201cDan Debicella is a practical problem solver who knows compromise doesn\u2019t have to be a dirty word in Washington,\u201d Brown said in a campaign spot in May.\n\nUConn's Schurin said Debicella\u2019s bipartisan messaging \u201cis just what the district wants to hear.\u201d\n\nThe Republican\u2019s campaign received a boost last week with the endorsement of the Independent Party of Connecticut. That means his name will appear on the ballot twice this November \u2013 as a Republican and as an Independent candidate.\n\nLiving the American Dream\n\nDebicella was raised in Shelton and still lives there with his wife Alex and 14-month-old son. He said he met his wife on his first and only blind date and fell in love at first sight, although it may have taken Alex longer to warm up to him.\n\nHis campaign taps the story of a working-class background. His father was a Bridgeport police officer and his mother was a secretary, and he said he\u2019s the only one in the family who has attended college full time.\n\n\u201cMy family has lived the American Dream,\u201d he said.\n\nDebicella earned a B.A. in finance from the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania in 1996. He went on to receive his M.B.A. from Harvard Business School in 2000.\n\nHe was the owner of Textbooks Online, worked as a management consultant for McKinsey & Company, as a director for strategy for PepsiCo and as a marketing executive for The Hartford insurance company.\n\nMost recently, he\u2019s taken a leave from a lucrative job at investment firm Bridgewater Associates to run for Congress.\n\nWhile he has quite a resume in the business world, Debicella has political experience too.\n\nWhen he graduated from Wharton and moved back to Shelton, he served on the town\u2019s Board of Apportionment and Taxation. He then ran successfully for a Connecticut Senate seat.\n\nDebicella\u2019s fundraising success has earned him a nod from the national Republican Party. The National Republican Congressional Committee has elevated him to \u201cYoung Gun\u201d status, which means he\u2019ll get party help in his quest to unseat Himes.\n\nThe NRCC hasn\u2019t spent any money on the race yet, but Debicella said he hopes it will come next month\u2013 in the form of third-party ads that are likely to attack Himes.\n\nMeanwhile, the Debicella campaign continues to run its own ads. His latest continues the theme that he\u2019s ready to clean up a failing political system. Called \u201cGrimes,\u201d a jab at Himes, it features a filthy refrigerator, filled with rotting food, roaches and flies. \u201cSix years of Jim Himes and Washington is a real mess,\u201d the 30-second spot says.\n\nDebicella has attacked Himes, a member of the House Finance Committee, for seeking a modification in the Dodd-Frank financial reform bill that is sought by many big banks, including Citibank, whose executives are among many of Himes\u2019 Wall Street supporters.\n\nDebicella said both Democrats and Republicans are guilty of favoring legislation pushed by campaign supporters, a \u201ccorrupting influence\u201d on Congress and a practice he\u2019d avoid.\n\nSchurin said the voters in the 4th District, many of whom work on Wall Street, expect their representative to look out for their interests. \u201cIf Himes continues to present himself as someone who supports that sector, that would be appealing,\u201d Schurin said.\n\nDebicella is also hitting Himes for failing to do more to improve transportation in the 4th District. Connecticut's slow economic recovery is another campaign theme.\n\nIf Debicella wins, he would be the only Republican in Connecticut\u2019s House delegation and one of the few Republicans in Congress from New England. To Debicella, that would be an advantage since the House of Representatives is expected to remain in Republican hands after the Nov. 4 election.\n\n\u201cDealing with some of the issues (successfully) can only be done if you are in the majority,\u201d he said. \u201cBeing in the majority would be very, very helpful.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"standout": "http://ctmirror.org/2014/09/08/debicella-runs-for-4th-district-seat-in-moderate-gop-tradition/", "news_keywords": "Politics, Washington, Congress, Dan Debicella, Democrats, Independent Party of Connecticut of, Jim Himes, mid-term election, Republicans, Tom Foley", "original-source": "http://ctmirror.org/2014/09/08/debicella-runs-for-4th-district-seat-in-moderate-gop-tradition/", "og": {"site_name": "The CT Mirror", "description": "WASHINGTON -- Dan Debicella is hoping voter disgust with Congress and his appeal as a moderate Republican in a district that has shown a preference for politicians of that stripe will propel him to victory in his second attempt to unseat Rep.
