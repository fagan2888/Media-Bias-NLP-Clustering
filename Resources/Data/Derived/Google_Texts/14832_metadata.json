Heyburn II\u2019s ruling that Kentucky\u2019s ban on recognizing same-sex unions from other states is unconstitutional, gay marriage has suddenly become a major issue in the conservative Bluegrass State.\n\nIt\u2019s happening on both sides of the aisle, too. On the Democratic side, Kentucky\u2019s Dem attorney general, Jack Conway, recently announced he would not personally represent the state in its appeal (outside counsel will instead). For Republicans, meanwhile, the issue has become most prominent through a radio ad from the Senate Conservatives Fund, a Tea Party group that\u2019s backing Sen. Mitch McConnell\u2019s primary opponent, businessman Matt Bevin.\n\nIn the ad, two assumedly regular Kentucky Republicans discuss Heyburn\u2019s ruling, describing the George H.W. Bush-appointed judge as \u201cliberal\u201d and blaming McConnell for recommending him way back in the early 1990s.\n\n\u201cUnbelievable! Liberal Judge John Heyburn just ruled that Kentucky has to immediately recognize same-sex marriages from other states,\u201d says an unnamed woman in the beginning of the ad.\n\n\u201cIs that the same judge who overturned the ban on partial-birth abortions?\u201d asks a man in response.\n\n\u201cYep.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho recommended this liberal judge?\u201d\n\n\u201cMitch McConnell.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Senate Conservatives Fund is still trying to portray the hard-right GOP heavyweight as a crypto-liberal VIDEO", "title": "Tea Party group blames Mitch McConnell for same-sex marriage", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The Senate Conservatives Fund is still trying to portray the hard-right GOP heavyweight as a crypto-liberal VIDEO", "title": "Tea Party group blames Mitch McConnell for same-sex marriage", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/03/05/tea_party_group_blames_mitch_mcconnell_for_same_sex_marriage/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/03/Screen-Shot-2014-03-05-at-11.04.52-AM-1280x734.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The Senate Conservatives Fund is still trying to portray the hard-right GOP heavyweight as a crypto-liberal VIDEO", "title": "Tea Party group blames Mitch McConnell for same-sex marriage", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/03/Screen-Shot-2014-03-05-at-11.04.52-AM-1280x734.png", "creator": "@eliasisquith", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Elias Isquith", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Gay Marriage, GOP Civil War, Jack Conway, Judge John G.
