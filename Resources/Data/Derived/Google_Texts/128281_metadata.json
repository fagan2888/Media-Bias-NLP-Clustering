They represented the state of Iowa and five different Medicaid managed care companies \u2014 three who were awarded state contracts, one who wasn\u2019t and one who was fighting to keep its contract.\n\nThat number actually had dwindled \u2014 in October 2015 there were more than three dozen. For the past four months, they\u2019ve been arguing over the Medicaid managed-care procurement process and whether it was fair and unbiased.\n\nIn August the state awarded contracts to four companies \u2014 Amerigroup Iowa, AmeriHealth Caritas Iowa, UnitedHealthcare of the River Valley and WellCare of Iowa \u2014 to manage the state\u2019s $5 billion Medicaid program.\n\nThree companies passed over for contracts originally argued the bidding process was flawed and biased. This ultimately resulted in the state of Iowa deciding to throw out WellCare\u2019s contract, a decision WellCare appealed before a judge on Feb. 1.\n\nMeanwhile, Meridian Health Plan of Iowa argued on Feb. 1 that its bid should be rescored and it should be given the opportunity to take WellCare\u2019s spot.\n\nSo why are these companies spending so much time and money on lawyers to fight over this?\n\nManaging the health care of the country\u2019s poor, old and disabled is a billion-dollar industry. In 2014, private insurers brought in $115 billion in Medicaid revenue, according to data compiled by health care-industry analytics company Mark Farrah Associates and analyzed by Kaiser Health News.\n\nMajor growth\n\nThe country\u2019s move to Medicaid managed care \u2014 an idea that has been around for decades \u2014 has exploded in the past several years, experts told The Gazette. That\u2019s because more states are deciding to transition from fee-for-service systems to managed care while states that already have made the change now are transferring their more complex populations into the managed-care pot.\n\nMore than 51 million Americans \u2014 or 70 percent of all Medicaid beneficiaries \u2014 now have a private, managed-care Medicaid health plan, according to a November 2015 PricewaterhouseCoopers report. Furthermore, the report found that in 2015, private plans added 7.8 million Medicaid recipients to their rolls, while those enrolled in a more traditional fee-for-service plan decreased by 1.4 million.\n\nA Gazette review of Securities and Exchange Commission filings for the managed-care companies chosen to care for the state\u2019s 560,000 Medicaid recipients starting March 1 shows that both revenues and Medicaid members have risen exponentially since 2003. Also in SEC filings:\n\n\u2022 Amerigroup has seen a 290 percent revenue increase. Medicaid revenues have grown from $1.6 billion and 857,000 members in 2003 to $6.3 billion and 2 million members in 2011, the last year information was available. Amerigroup was purchased by Anthem in 2012.\n\n\u2022 WellCare Health Plans has seen a 950 percent revenue increase from 2003 to 2014. Medicaid revenues have grown from $740 million and 512,000 members in 2003 to $7.7 billion and 2.3 million members in 2014.\n\n\u2022 UnitedHealth Group has seen an 807 percent revenue increase. Medicaid revenues have grown from $2.6 billion and 1.1 million members in 2003 to $23.5 billion and 5 million members in 2014.\n\nTo see the full visualization, click here .\n\nInformation was not available for AmeriHealth Caritas, which is a private company and not required to file annual reports with the SEC.\n\nA \u2018tipping point\u2019\n\nThere are two main drivers fueling the growth behind managed care, industry experts said. The first is overall Medicaid growth, thanks in part to the expansion under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010.\n\nThe Medicaid expansion brought about 15 million new people into the fold in the past two years, said Ari Gottlieb, author of the PricewaterhouseCoopers report. Gottlieb, who has looked at the growth of Medicaid and managed care for three years now, called the growth \u201cphenomenal.\u201d\n\nMore than 73 million people now rely on Medicaid to help with their health care needs, he added, which is about 16 percent more than it was three years ago.\n\nThe second factor leading state governors, including Iowa\u2019s Terry Branstad, to move these individuals into managed-care plans is a desire to stabilize their budgets.\n\n\u201cMedicaid is always the No. 1 or No. 2 line item in terms of expenses\u201d in a state\u2019s budget, said Mark Kelly, an equity researcher for Stifel Nicolaus, a St. Louis-based investment bank. Kelly researches the health care industry, including hospitals, pharmacy benefit management companies and managed care.\n\nThat Medicaid expense, he added, is \u201ca massive headache.\u201d\n\nSo more states are turning to private plans to control spending. In a traditional fee-for-service plan, states reimburse physicians, hospitals and other Medicaid providers for services given to enrollees.\n\nThis makes Medicaid spending highly unpredictable from year to year, Kelly said. With managed care, states instead pay the private insurers a fee for each Medicaid recipient enrolled with their plan.\n\nThe fixed costs allow a state to be better able to budget and fund other initiatives.\n\nSo as more states opt to move in this direction, private companies are working to secure lucrative contracts. Kelly guessed that in the past 36 months, billions of dollars in state contracts were awarded across the nation.\n\nIowa awarded contracts to four companies in 2015; Kentucky rebid its managed-care contracts and awarded contracts to four companies; and Georgia, which had contracts with three managed-care companies, awarded an additional contract in its re-procurement process.\n\nNow, with 40 states moving at least part of their Medicaid populations, Kelly and Gottlieb said future managed-care growth lies in insuring a state\u2019s more complex populations.\n\nKelly said the majority of people in managed-care plans are low-income women and children. He added that the more complex populations \u2014 including those with disabilities, in long-term care services and dual eligible \u2014 account for most of the Medicaid spending but only have been moved to managed care in recent years.\n\n\u201cThose people have not really been pushed over to managed care,\u201d he said. \u201cBut this higher acuity (complex) population has more inefficiencies and mean bigger savings.\u201d\n\nBut these new populations bring new challenges for the insurance companies, Gottlieb said \u2014 individuals are more complicated to care for, have more doctors and prescriptions to manage, and could result in losing money.\n\nWellCare\u2019s fight\n\nFor Tampa, Fla.-based WellCare, the potential loss of Iowa\u2019s contract is \u201can unfortunate set of circumstances,\u201d Blair Todt, WellCare\u2019s senior vice president, chief legal and administrative officer, said during a telephone interview Friday.\n\nWellCare spent big money in the state \u2014 at least $11.2 million, according to court filings \u2014 and hired close to 200 people to be ready for the managed-care switch.\n\nBut the company\u2019s contract was thrown out in mid-December after a state arbiter \u2014 who in siding with an administrative law judge \u2014 said the company failed to properly disclose in its bid a corporate integrity agreement and information regarding more than $137.5 million in fines to resolve false claims litigation.\n\nLawyers for the Tampa-based company argued during its appeal of the decision in district court that the information was provided after the state committee in charge of evaluating the managed-care bid applicants asked a clarifying question in regard to false claims litigation. WellCare officials said it provided detailed information about its corporate integrity agreement as well as why it had to pay \u201csubstantial\u201d fines.\n\nTodt said the company isn\u2019t making any decisions about next steps until it sees the judge\u2019s final decision, but WellCare \u201ccontinues to be disappointed that none of the issues raised\u201d have anything to do with the company\u2019s ability to manage the health care of the state\u2019s Medicaid population.\n\n\u201cNow there will only be three companies,\u201d he said, adding if the state chooses to add a fourth, it will be to a company already deemed as not qualified.\n\nTodt said he doesn\u2019t believe what happened in Iowa will affect any of WellCare\u2019s future bids for Medicaid contracts in other states. But he noted that the company will answer request-for-proposal questions differently and will do a better job of leveraging its compliance plan, which he believes is one of the strongest in the country.\n\nA WellCare analysis shows there\u2019s potential for $45 billion to $50 billion worth of state Medicaid procurement opportunities in the coming three years, Todt said, and the company hopes to capture some of those dollars. WellCare also plans to grow through acquisitions, its Medicare Advantage business and caring for more complex Medicaid populations.\n\n\u201cWe will grow our footprint as much as we can,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"Description": "The Gazette | DES MOINES - Seventeen lawyers sat in a Polk County District Court room on Feb. 1.
