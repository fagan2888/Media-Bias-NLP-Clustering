Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., attacked Ryan by name over permitting an expansion of the H-2B visa program for low-skilled \u201cguest workers.\u201d\n\n\u201cBlithely dismissing the just concerns of the great majority of American voters, and especially Republican voters, is not a wise course for the Republican speaker,\u201d Sessions said in a prepared statement.\n\nIn question are H-2B visas designed to allow low-skilled foreign workers to take temporary blue-collar jobs in the United States. A provision in the 2,009-page spending bill increases the program\u2019s eligibility cap from 66,000 workers to 264,000.\n\nSessions, a critic of current immigration enforcement practices, argues that the program disenfranchises Republican voters and endangers American jobs.\n\nRyan dismissed criticism of the program Thursday during an appearance on Michael Medved\u2019s radio show:\n\nThe H-2B worker provision in here \u2026 it\u2019s, like, 8,000 temporary workers for one year, is all this provision provides. \u2026 [B]ut I think there are those who for various reasons are trying to make a mountain out of a molehill, making an issue something that it isn\u2019t.\n\nAn aide in the speaker\u2019s office told The Daily Signal that Ryan had no role in crafting the specific change to immigration law. Instead, the aide said, the program is a product of committee action.\n\n\u201cI want committees driving the process,\u201d Ryan said at a press conference Thursday. \u201cI want committees writing the legislation, and that\u2019s what happened here.\u201d\n\nThe legislation in question was voted out of the Appropriations Committee before Ryan even picked up the speaker\u2019s gavel in late October. The panel approved it by a vote of 32-17 on July 21.\n\n>>> Conservatives \u2018Shocked\u2019 by Inclusion of Immigration Change in Spending Bill\n\nSince becoming speaker six weeks ago after John Boehner, R-Ohio, resigned from the post, Ryan has made a top priority out of going back to the process known inside Washington as regular order.\n\nDuring the appropriations process, Ryan\u2019s office sought input from rank-and-file members and hosted policy conferences to field concerns.\n\nSessions. however, still blames Ryan and House leadership for the expanded guest workers provision.\n\n\u201cThere was no effort to protect American jobs, wages, and communities from uncontrolled immigration,\u201d the Alabama Republican said.\n\n\u201cCongress has no desire to ever protect Americans from uncontrolled immigration,\u201d he added.\n\nRyan rejects that narrative, saying that the omnibus spending bill is the product of compromise. The speaker told Medved:\n\nWe scored major policy wins for conservatives\u2014for our country\u2014in this bill \u2026 we advanced our principles. Did we advance all of our principles as far as we want to go? No, because we\u2019re in divided government. But we did advance them in the right direction.\n\nRyan plans to overhaul the appropriations process in the next Congress. A vocal opponent of omnibus spending bills, Ryan has said the House will approve spending bills one at a time rather than all together in a single lump package.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Sen.
