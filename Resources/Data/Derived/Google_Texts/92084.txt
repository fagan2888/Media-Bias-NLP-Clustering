Congratulations, Hobby Lobby. Your Supreme victory over Obamacare excuses you from providing certain kinds of contraception to your female employees.

But you now find yourself smack dab in the middle of a divisive social issue, with one side hooting this ruling is a win for religious freedom while the other side hollers it's a hostile jab at women's rights.

I can understand how good Christians like Hobby Lobby's owners, David and Barbara Green of Oklahoma, could be squeamish about supplying certain kinds of birth control to their women workers, but they have no problem investing in the companies who make the stuff. Contraception is complicated.

Birth control is an important part of women's healthcare. With all the controversy, will Hobby Lobby have trouble recruiting and keeping women employees?

Maybe they'll have to go looking for a few good nuns. Lighten up, y'all.
