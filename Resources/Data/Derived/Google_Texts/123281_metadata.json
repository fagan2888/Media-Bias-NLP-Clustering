The woman\u2019s son, who carries on with a Financial Elder Abuse lawsuit on behalf of his now-deceased mother, notes that such alleged deception of vulnerable individuals should serve as a rallying cry for advocates concerned about financial exploitation of seniors.\n\n\n\nThe News-Press of Fort Myers (9/8/13). \u201cAfter I read through that policy, it was like, here\u2019s the one guy that she and her late husband had entrusted...and then [her financial adviser] could do this to them?\u201d\n\n\n\nThe alleged elder abuse financial issue has its roots in 2006, when Gloria J. Emmert was 79 years of age and living modestly in a manufactured home located in North Fort Myers, Florida. The widow suffered from dementia and Alzheimer\u2019s disease.\n\n\n\nElder financial abuse is not just a problem in Florida, which is a haven for snowbirds and retirees. It happens right across the country, prompting inclusion, in 2010, of the Elder Care Justice Act as part of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.\n\n\n\nIn California, Governor Jerry Brown signed into state law Assembly Bill (AB) 381 - legislation that allows courts of law to award attorney\u2019s fees and costs to seniors victimized by powers of attorney acting in bad faith and apart from the best interests of the senior entrusted to them.\n\n\n\nThis point was driven home by a recent case in California that saw a former Alameda County Superior Court judge plead no contest to relieving a 97-year-old neighbor of her life savings while serving as her power of attorney. According to The San Francisco Chronicle (8/2/13), Paul Seeman befriended Anne Nutting and her late husband (who died in 1999), obtaining powers of attorney for the couple. Seeman, according to charges filed in California last year, gained control of Nutting\u2019s finances and barred her from her home from 1999 - the year her husband died - through 2007. Forcing her to take a room in a hotel for those eight years, Seeman is said to have sold off her art collection.\n\n\n\nAccording to The Chronicle, Seeman stepped down from the bench in March and is barred from seeking judicial office in the state. He has also been disbarred from practicing law in the state of California and pled no contest to the charges. In a plea deal, Seeman will avoid jail time and is expected to face five years of probation when his sentencing takes place October 22. Anne Nutting passed away in 2010.\n\n\n\nIn Florida, Michael Sterling is carrying the legal torch for his late mother. According to his elderly financial abuse lawsuit, the $7.5 million life insurance policy was based on an application using fraudulent information pertaining to Emmert\u2019s finances. Premiums on the policy were $742,000. In order to fund the premiums, a loan amortized over 30 months was arranged at an interest rate of 17.95 percent. With interest factored in, total cost of the loan ballooned to $1.1 million which, according to the lawsuit, \u201cfar exceeded the entirety\u201d of Emmert\u2019s assets.\n\n\n\nEmmert\u2019s elder financial abuse exploitation continued with the establishment of the Gloria J. Emmert Estate Reduction Trust, which was named sole beneficiary of the insurance policy. A secondary trust, or sub trust, was created to hold responsibility for the loan.\n\n\n\nIn theory, upon Emmert\u2019s death the policy would pay out $7.5 million minus the cost of the $1.1 million loan, with final proceeds of $6.4 million to the primary trust. It was never established who was beneficiary of the primary trust. However, defendants in the lawsuit are thought to have benefited through the earning of commissions or other forms of compensation stemming from the issuance of the life insurance policy.\n\n\n\nElderly financial abuse is known to be a common problem in Southwest Florida, where many elderly Americans go to retire. According to The News-Press, there were 25 arrests for elderly financial exploitation in Lee and Collier counties since 2008. However, advocates note that the vast majority of financial abuse cases are not reported and fall under the radar.\n\n\n\n\u201cOh my gosh, that seems very low,\u201d said Dotty St. Amand, co-chair of the Lee Elder Abuse Prevention Partnership. St. Amand stated further that many cases of financial abuse elderly are underreported out of embarrassment, or if the adviser is someone whom the victim knows. In Emmert\u2019s case, the primary financial adviser and catalyst of the multimillion-dollar life insurance policy was someone who had been advising both Emmert and her late husband for about 20 years. St. Amand also noted that seniors who suffer from dementia and who live alone are favored targets.\n\n\n\n\u201cData around elder abuse in general (are) very limited,\u201d said Kathleen Quinn, executive director of the National Adult Protective Services Association based in Springfield, Illinois, in comments published in The News-Press. Emmert\u2019s son, who carries on his mother\u2019s lawsuit after Emmert passed away, can\u2019t understand what would lead someone to introduce such an idea to a vulnerable senior. \u201cMy mother could never have afforded the monthly premiums on a face value of that loan,\u201d Sterling said. \u201cShe only made $1,800 income,\u201d between Social Security and her pension.\n\n\n\nAccording to the report, 10,000 Baby Boomers turn 65 every day in the US.
