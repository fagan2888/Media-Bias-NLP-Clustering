Hillary Clinton is the woman (well, a woman) who blamed the Benghazi, Libya murder of four Americans on an Internet video. She claimed to have come under sniper fire in Bosnia. She claimed to have been named after Sir Edmund Hillary. Her long list of lies is legendary.\n\nMrs. Clinton has an equally troublesome history with transparency. The 900+ FBI files. The Rose Law Firm records. Her then chief of staff shuttling boxes and boxes of documents out of the late Vince Foster\u2019s Justice Department office. And on, and on, and\u2026.\n\nAnd cronyism?\n\nCozy. Now it has been revealed that she never, ever set up a government email account.\n\nHer alleged reason? \u201cI didn\u2019t want to carry two devices\u201d \u2013 which we now know is a lie.\n\nHer alleged self-defense? \u201cTrust me \u2013 I alone decided which emails were pertinent. Oh \u2013 and I deleted everything else.\u201d When \u201ceverything else\u201d was under Congressional subpoena.\n\nFeel comfortable trusting her? Think this is a lifetime\u2019s worth of truth and transparency? Me neither.\n\nIn this regard, Mrs. Clinton fit right in with the Barack Obama Administration. On truth:\n\nAnd transparency:\n\nAnd in moments of harmonic convergence \u2013 truth about transparency.\n\nAnd cronyism.\n\nIs this ceaseless dearth of truth, transparency and fair play exclusive to Administration Democrats? Of course not.\n\nIs this ceaseless dearth exclusive to federal Democrats? Of course not.\n\nLet\u2019s look at Oregon, their attempt at ObamaCare and their disgraced, under-investigation, resigned-from-office ex-Democrat Governor John Kitzhaber, shall we?\n\nHave some Oregon Democrat cronyism.\n\nHow\u2019d that Kitzhaber crony do running the show?\n\nNot so good. How about a little Oregon Democrat truth-transparency combo?\n\nWant some more Oregon Democrat transparency?\n\nFormer (Oregon Democrat) Gov. John Kitzhaber\u2019s and Cylvia Hayes\u2019 Trip to Dump Brings Police Sweeping In The former governor and Hayes showed up at the Knott Landfill southeast of Bend in a pickup and an SUV about 2 p.m. last Friday and spent a few minutes dumping trash, according to Timm Schimke, the director of the Deschutes County Solid Waste Department\u2026. (W)orkers recognized who they were dealing with and apparently decided the dumping might be of interest to law enforcement. Kitzhaber and Hayes are targets of a federal investigation.\n\nPositively translucent. And of course this is as much a federal government problem as it is an Oregon one.\n\nNew Cover Oregon Allegations: \u2018If It\u2019s True, Someone\u2019s Going to Prison\u2019 Early in its life, Cover Oregon was given a $48 million \u201cearly innovator\u201d grant from the federal government. That amount would later grow to $59 million. There were a few strings attached. To keep the money flowing, the website would have to hit specific benchmarks between 2011 and 2013. The state needed to show the feds it had picked a company to provide software and technical assistance; it had to demonstrate that the website was safe from hackers; and, most importantly, it had to show that people could actually sign up for insurance on the website.\n\nEither the Obama Administration dropped the ball over and over and over again \u2013 or it simply allowed a fellow Democrat to run wild with hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars.\n\nThankfully, not everyone in Washington is quite so comfortable with this.\n\nUnfortunately, this is likely made more than a little problematic by Kitzhaber\u2019s little trip to the landfill \u2013 the old school version of Mrs. Clinton wiping clean her email server.\n\nRegardless, the investigations must press forward. Of Mrs. Clinton \u2013 and both ObamaCare messes. In Oregon and D.C.\n\nTruth, transparency and anti-cronyism are all being eviscerated. And like all political fish \u2013 this one is rotting from the head of state.\n\nStart with the Obama Administration \u2013 and work your way down.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Human Events", "description": "I think at this point in our collective national existence, \u201cTrust me, I\u2019m a Clinton\u201d isn\u2019t the best defense of one\u2019s actions.", "title": "Hillary Clinton\u2019s Wiped Server: Democrats Love Truth and Transparency and Loathe Cronyism | Human Events", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://humanevents.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/2015_04_02_145748_05d325ff-0d35-4de5-906a-97c0ca1a82c3.jpg", "url": "http://humanevents.com/2015/04/02/hillary-clintons-wiped-server-democrats-love-truth-and-transparency-and-loathe-cronyism/", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"pages": 212436860202}, "description": "I think at this point in our collective national existence, \u201cTrust me, I\u2019m a Clinton\u201d isn\u2019t the best defense of one\u2019s actions.", "twitter": {"image": "http://humanevents.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/2015_04_02_145748_05d325ff-0d35-4de5-906a-97c0ca1a82c3.jpg", "site": "@humanevents", "card": "summary", "description": "I think at this point in our collective national existence, \u201cTrust me, I\u2019m a Clinton\u201d isn\u2019t the best defense of one\u2019s actions."}}, "article_summary": "Want some more Oregon Democrat transparency?\nTruth, transparency and anti-cronyism are all being eviscerated.\nIs this ceaseless dearth of truth, transparency and fair play exclusive to Administration Democrats?\nHow about a little Oregon Democrat truth-transparency combo?\nHave some Oregon Democrat cronyism."}
