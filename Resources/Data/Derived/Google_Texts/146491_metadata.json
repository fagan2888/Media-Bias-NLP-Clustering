The Eagan-based insurer also touted the breadth of its 17 different plan designs in Rochester and across the state.\n\nIn a prepared response to questions, McManus of Blue Cross said: \u201cWe are proud to build on our legacy of being the first plan to offer an option in all 87 counties when MNsure launched last fall.\u201d\n\nThe new Medica product will be available both through MNsure, as well as the private health insurance market \u201coutside\u201d the state\u2019s health exchange.\n\nColeman would not say whether the Mayo Clinic is granting special discounts to Medica on the cost of particular health care services.\n\nNegotiated payment rates between insurers and health care providers typically are confidential. But data over the years from a Minneapolis-based nonprofit called Minnesota Community Measurement has suggested that some clinics and hospitals in the Rochester area get much higher payments than facilities elsewhere when providing the same service.\n\nThe nonprofit\u2019s data, for example, showed Mayo Clinic receiving $1,311 when performing a colonoscopy in 2012, whereas the statewide median at the time was $563.\n\nDr. Brian Whited, vice chair of operations for the Mayo Clinic Health System, said he couldn\u2019t comment on insurance costs in Rochester but said the system\u2019s network of hospitals and clinics has implemented a number of reforms to control health care costs.\n\nAdam Brase, a Mayo Clinic spokesman, said the new health plan offering with Medica is an example of Mayo Clinic working with insurance companies to make sure residents in Rochester have access to the clinic at affordable prices.\n\n\u201cThis is really one of the first times that we\u2019ve been partnering with an insurance carrier that would have that \u2018narrow network\u2019 component,\u201d said Dr. Brian Whited, vice chair of operations for the Mayo Clinic Health System. Patients won\u2019t have as much choice in selecting doctors and hospitals, Whited said, but that\u2019s less of an issue in southern Minnesota because of Mayo Clinic\u2019s large market share.\n\n\u201cWe have the entire range of care,\u201d he said.\n\nStarting in 2013, the federal Affordable Care Act made it easier for consumers to see long-standing differences in the cost of health care across the country. On Minnesota\u2019s MNsure health insurance exchange, for example, premiums for the lowest-cost policies in Rochester in 2014 were anywhere from 64 to 109 percent higher than in the Twin Cities, according to a Star Tribune analysis.\n\nThe gap is narrowing somewhat in 2015, with the lowest-cost policies in Rochester running anywhere from 45 to 76 percent higher than comparable health plans in the Twin Cities. The Medica/Mayo Clinic product apparently is one reason the gap is shrinking.\n\nMedica officials say the new Mayo Clinic offering is the low-cost policy in southeast Minnesota for all MNsure plans approved this month by the state Commerce Department.\n\nTwitter: @chrissnowbeck", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Star Tribune", "description": "It offers Mayo Clinic plan in region with above-average premiums.
