As a fourth part of this ongoing Truven Top 100 series, Neerav Jadeja, Administrator at Paradise Valley Hospital, spoke with RevCycleIntelligence.com about revenue cycle management best practices, maintaining operational efficiency and financial stability, value-based care initiatives, and how to best heighten the customer experience.\n\nImitation is the sincerest form of operational flattery\n\nOne primary advantage of being a national, rapidly expanding 34-hospital system is the ability to duplicate and disseminate what works, says Jadeja. One strategy to improve value-based and payer reimbursement is to duplicate proven best practices within newly acquired hospitals, maintains Jadeja.\n\n\u201cThe experience gleaned from acquiring and turning around 34 hospitals in 11 states has resulted in a number of experts on the corporate staff who are always accessible to the individual hospitals,\u201d explains Jadeja, who confirms the large hospital system\u2019s continued emphasis on-staff expertise resulted in a Top 100 award nearly three dozen times.\n\nOnce a best practice is recognized, Jadeja says it is expediently replicated within other hospitals for maximum revenue effect. \u201cWhen we see things at one place that\u2019s working well, we try to take it to our other facilities so we can continue to improve,\u201d Jadeja confirms.\n\nThe healthcare industry is in a continuous state of evolution when it comes to matters of reimbursement, says Jadeja. New challenges arise on a daily basis, he explains. Seeking stability when it comes to best practices leads to successful claims processing. \u201cWhen it comes to revenue cycle, if we find a way that allows us to potentially get paid on a claim through a payer, that helps,\u201d he confirms.\n\nUnderstanding the root cause of denials is an essential element of impeding frustration following claim denial, says Jadeja. In cases where an error is based on misunderstanding, such as an outpatient services being erroneously billed as an inpatient service, acknowledging personal and organizational functions and goals helps promote smooth claims processing.\n\n\u201cYou have to figure out how to communicate with people and how to connect with people. That is a key to collecting and understanding how the different insurance companies are,\u201d Jadeja says. Making sure those billing offices and collections offices can execute different needed functions and processes, yet cohesively remain on the same page will help eliminate a backup or incorrect claims processing, he states.\n\nRunning lean to keeping expenses low and quality high\n\nJadeja says sharing healthcare knowledge is what makes all the difference, especially following the implementation of the Affordable Care Act. \u201cBeing part of a larger corporation, we have experts centrally that are able to help,\u201d Jadeja maintains. \u201cWhen one facility has the best practice and they learn something, we share our information.\u201d As the healthcare industry evolves, Jadeja says the ability to keep up is imperative to widespread success.\n\nThe leadership structure of Paradise Valley hospital and its accompanying hospital systems is simplistic in nature, confirms Jadeja. Multiple positions only simply create additional work, he maintains. \u201cWe run relatively lean from a senior leadership perspective,\u201d Jadeja confirms. \u201cThat allows us to help keep expenses down,\u201d he adds. Identifying and sharing core measure methods, advanced means of documentation, or strengthened physician communication strategies is a key element to proving consistently high quality care, adds Jadeja.\n\nHeightening the customer experience with rapport\n\nWhen patients are in the hospital, they are primarily concerned with their healthcare, says Jadeja. Maintaining high quality of care measures means patients are more likely to be happy, he adds. Patient involvement is key, says Jadeja. \u201cOur excellent patient experience coordinator rounds on patients daily and helps ensure any problems are resolved immediately,\u201d explains Jadeja. \u201cI also round daily to ensure our nurses and other staff have what they need to provide the best patient experience.\u201d\n\nJadeja maintains his staff is simply friendly instead of politically-based and their rapport is strong. \u201cIf everyone\u2019s got this nice culture, the patient experience follows. Patients have a good experience because everyone is generally happy,\u201d he comments. \u201cNothing substitutes for quality care, taking care of patients, and setting expectations.\u201d\n\nFuture plans are in place to enhance quality care further, says Jadeja. \u201cWe are on a multi-year plan to remodel patient units and common areas and upgrade our technology to ensure our facility truly reflects the high quality of care we our providing,\" he adds.\n\nMaintaining financial stability with word of mouth\n\nWithout this aforementioned quality, nothing else matters, says Jadeja. \u201cHealthcare is constantly changing so maintaining financial stability is challenging, especially in a low-income area,\u201d he maintains. \u201cWe are always looking to ensure we are reimbursed for the services we provide and to improve our communication with our payers on claims to ensure financial stability and balance our large charitable care contributions.\u201d\n\nCommunication with a billing office staff promotes understanding, says Jadeja. Guaranteeing insurance companies submit claims appropriately and receive reimbursements, instead of denials, entails active involvement to maintain smooth operational efficiency, he adds.\n\nThe best marketing strategy for a hospital or healthcare organization, says Jadeja, is simply word of mouth. When someone says they had a great experience, financial stability is enhanced, he reveals. \u201cIf you\u2019re doing financially well at one hospital but people don\u2019t like you in the community, eventually someone else is going to open up a hospital or provide services and it\u2019s going to take away from your financial stability,\u201d Jadeja discloses.\n\nBalancing your books to keep collections running smoothly is often an overlooked concept, says Jadeja. \u201cUnderstanding your financial piece is key,\u201d Jadeja states. \u201cIf you\u2019re bringing in a certain amount of revenue, you can\u2019t have expenses that exceed that revenue. It\u2019s seems very basic but people don\u2019t look at it that way.\u201d\n\nPromoting stability enhances financial success\n\nKeeping patients happy is one element of financial success. But keeping employees, payers, and professionals happy is just as important. The results are cyclical in nature as the two pieces directly interlock. \u201cOur patients benefit from this culture of teamwork and compassion, which, in turn, benefits the hospital\u2019s bottom line,\u201d Jadeja maintains. Promoting a culture where people want to stay is crucial to financial success, says Jadeja.\n\n\u201cWhat sets us apart is that we have physicians and staff who are committed to the hospital\u2019s success and stability, and not just about punching a time clock,\u201d he adds. \u201cHaving those people that are truly vested in your facility makes a huge difference.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Neerav Jadeja, Administrator at Paradise Valley Hospital, Truven Top 100,discusses revenue cycle management best practices, and value-based initiatives.", "author": "RevCycleIntelligence", "og": {"url": "http://revcycleintelligence.com/news/how-paradise-valley-succeeds-in-revenue-cycle-management", "site_name": "RevCycleIntelligence", "image": "http://revcycleintelligence.com/images/site/articles/imageedit_11_6250368736.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "How Paradise Valley Succeeds in Revenue Cycle Management"}, "twitter": {"description": "Neerav Jadeja, Administrator at Paradise Valley Hospital, Truven Top 100,discusses revenue cycle management best practices, and value-based initiatives.", "creator": "@RevCycleIntel", "image": {"src": "http://revcycleintelligence.com/images/site/articles/imageedit_11_6250368736.jpg"}, "title": "How Paradise Valley Succeeds in Revenue Cycle Management", "site": "@RevCycleIntel", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "index, follow", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2af2\"", "article_summary": "\u201cNothing substitutes for quality care, taking care of patients, and setting expectations.\u201dFuture plans are in place to enhance quality care further, says Jadeja.\nWhen someone says they had a great experience, financial stability is enhanced, he reveals.\nThe leadership structure of Paradise Valley hospital and its accompanying hospital systems is simplistic in nature, confirms Jadeja.\nAs a fourth part of this ongoing Truven Top 100 series, Neerav Jadeja, Administrator at Paradise Valley Hospital, spoke with RevCycleIntelligence.com about revenue cycle management best practices, maintaining operational efficiency and financial stability, value-based care initiatives, and how to best heighten the customer experience.\nOnce a best practice is recognized, Jadeja says it is expediently replicated within other hospitals for maximum revenue effect."}
