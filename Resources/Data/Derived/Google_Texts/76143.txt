The rain didn't stop anyone from having a good time tonight at the Ralph Morgan Rodeo.

The stands were packed with fans young and old for Saturday's events. The events started off with bareback riding, with lots of cowboys trying to stay on their horses as long as possible. Rodeo founder Ralph Morgan talked about all of the people that help put this radio together.

"Kids and 4-H and all are involved. A lot of family joins in and helps you know and it makes it real good. We certainly appreciate it. I think the rodeo is good for the community," said rodeo founder Ralph Morgan.

If you missed out on the rodeo this weekend, the next one will be taking place in August.
