That is a change from last year.\"\n\nThis data is a follow-up on Pew's report earlier this week showing that pre-teens account for the sharpest spike in unaccompanied child migrants.\n\nWhen looking at the gender breakdown for those under 12, Pew found a 140% increase in girls apprehended and 100% increase among boys.\n\nBut probably most shocking in their analysis is the difference between boy and girl unaccompanied teenagers apprehended.\n\nTeenage girls saw an increase of 62% this year, but teenage boys have seen almost no change - only 2%.\n\n\"Teenage boys have been a big point of this unaccompanied minors story, but many of those teenage boys 15,16,17 years of age, to the higher end - these are young people who in many respects may be of working age,\" Lopez said. \"More interesting question is why have we seen the surge or spike in children and teenage girls.\"\n\nLopez said that spike is being driven largely by those fleeing violence in Honduras and El Salvador, and according to the Department of Homeland Security, poverty in Guatemala.\n\nHonduras had the highest 2012 murder rate in the world with 90.4 homicides per 100,000 people, and El Salvador had 41.2, according to a report by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime.\n\nHonduras is first and El Salvador is second when looking at all unaccompanied girls apprehended this year by country, according to Pew's analysis.\n\nPresident Obama is meeting today with the leaders of the three countries - Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador - at the White House to discuss the flow of children.", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "More Undocumented Kids, Especially Girls, Crossing the Border: Report", "description": "More Undocumented Kids, Especially Girls, Crossing the Border: Report", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 ABC News Internet Ventures", "author": "ABC News", "og": {"url": "http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2014/07/more-undocumented-kids-especially-girls-crossing-the-border-report/", "site_name": "ABC News", "description": "New report by the Pew Research Center shows dramatic increases.", "title": "More Undocumented Kids, Especially Girls, Crossing the Border: Report"}, "robots": "index, follow", "fb": {"admins": 704409894, "app_id": 4942312939}, "keywords": "border patrol, children, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, illegal immigration, pew, unaccompanied children, undocumented immigrants, politics news, election news, political news, political news articles", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd4322\"", "article_summary": "Teenage girls saw an increase of 62% this year, but teenage boys have seen almost no change - only 2%.\nHonduras is first and El Salvador is second when looking at all unaccompanied girls apprehended this year by country, according to Pew's analysis.\n\u2026 The growth in unaccompanied kids this year has been driven in large part by more children and more girls crossing the border illegally.\n\"More interesting question is why have we seen the surge or spike in children and teenage girls.\"\n\"And while they still do make up the bulk of those crossing the border, we've seen a spike in the number of children and the number of girls and that's different from 2013."}
