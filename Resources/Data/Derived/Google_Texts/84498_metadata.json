One of the Big Three is no longer headquartered in America, and the vast majority of their cars are built from imported parts. It\u2019s tough to pin down the nationality of a Chrysler which is now owned by an Italian company headquartered in the United Kingdom.\n\nThe recently released 2015 American-Made Index from Cars.com, which ranks cars with at least 75 percent domestic content, has just seven cars on it. That\u2019s down from 29 cars five years ago.\n\nThe top-ranking vehicle, the Toyota Camry, may be made by a Japanese manufacturer, but it rolls off of assembly lines in Georgetown, Ky., and Lafayette, Ind.\n\n\u201cPeople have to figure out what their definition of an American made car is,\u201d says Carol Lachnit, features editor at Edmunds.com. \u201cDoes that mean a car that is made in America? Because cars that are made in America may not be made by American companies.\u201d\n\nRelated: Wanted in 2015: A Car No One Else Has\n\nContributing to the economy\n\nThose \u201cnon-American\u201d cars are a major factor in the U.S. economy. Japanese car manufacturers and dealers were responsible for 1.36 million job in 2013, 10 percent more than in 2011, according to a paper by Rutgers professor Thomas Prusa. Those jobs pay American workers more than $85 billion.\n\nJapanese manufacturers aren\u2019t the only foreign auto producers creating American jobs. BMW announced last year that it would invest a $1 billion in its South Carolina plant, making it its biggest factory in the world.\n\nNearly three-quarters of the cars produced at the BMW factory are sold overseas. U.S. auto exports in general are increasing. Last year more than 2.1 million American built cars were sold overseas, The Wall Street Journal reports.\n\nEven as the trend toward automakers using more imported parts grows, the number of cars being assembled in the United States is increasing. Last year, American auto plants assembled more than 100 models of new cars, according to Cars.com. That\u2019s partly due to the weak dollar in recent years (and may change given is newfound strength), and partly due to the weakened power of unions following the Great Recession. The Asian and European factories in the South are largely not unionized.\n\nWages for autoworkers generally are on the decline. Employees at motor vehicle manufacturing plants earned a median $24.83 per hour in 2013, down 21 percent in the past decade, and employees at parts manufacturers earned an average $15.83, down 13.73 percent over 10 years, according to a November report by the National Employment Law Project.\n\nRelated: Car Companies Grab Loan Business From Banks\n\nFinding American-made cars\n\nThree of the four top cars on the American Made Index came from Honda and Toyota. The Ford F-150, which was the top vehicle on the list last year, fell off entirely, since the 2015 model gets more parts from overseas. Consumers interested in learning where a car was assembled can check the VIN. If it starts with a 1, 4, or 5, you can be confident that auto was assembled in a U.S.-based plant.\n\nThat may not satisfy consumers who want a vehicle comprised of American made parts. They\u2019ll have to do some research on their own, since the American Automobile Labeling Act, which certifies car as being made in America with an AALA sticker, is a notoriously poor indicator of a car\u2019s actual origin. \u201cThe badge on the car doesn\u2019t necessarily represent the Americanness of it,\u201d says Kelsey Mays, senior consumer affairs editor for Cars.com.\n\nInstead, consumers could check the Cars.com index or the Kogod School of Business\n\nMade in America Auto Index, which ranks cars based on where their parts are assembled as well as the location of their global headquarters and where the company conducts research and development. The top-ranking 2015 car on that index is the Buick Enclave.\n\nFrank DuBois, the creator of the list, says that even in the halcyon days of the 1960s, when consumers purchased an Oldsmobile or a Chevy as a patriotic duty, cars weren\u2019t entirely American-made. \u201cWhere did the rubber in the tires come from?\u201d he asks.\n\nThe desire for American-made cars has grown in recent years, but it\u2019s nowhere near what it was when Asian imports remade the automotive landscape in the 1980s and 1990s with cheaper, better vehicles. Twenty-eight percent of consumers recently told Cars.com that they want American made cars, up from 23 percent four years ago.\n\nRegardless of where they\u2019re built, sales of cars in the United States are booming. The National Automobile Dealers Association predicts that sales of new cars will hit 17.17 million this year, up for the sixth consecutive year.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "It used to be easy to buy an American car: You\u2019d go to the lot, pick out a vehicle bui", "title": "The Incredible Disappearing American-Made Car", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/07/19/Incredible-Disappearing-American-Made-Car", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/gm_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/07/19/Incredible-Disappearing-American-Made-Car", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/gm_1.jpg", "creator": "@bethbrav", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "It used to be easy to buy an American car: You\u2019d go to the lot, pick out a vehicle bui", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Related: Car Companies Grab Loan Business From BanksFinding American-made carsThree of the four top cars on the American Made Index came from Honda and Toyota.\n\u201cPeople have to figure out what their definition of an American made car is,\u201d says Carol Lachnit, features editor at Edmunds.com.\nThe recently released 2015 American-Made Index from Cars.com, which ranks cars with at least 75 percent domestic content, has just seven cars on it.\nLast year, American auto plants assembled more than 100 models of new cars, according to Cars.com.\nConsumers interested in learning where a car was assembled can check the VIN."}
