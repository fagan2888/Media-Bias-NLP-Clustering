This rate was expected to jump above 5 percent this year until a Russian plane crash in the Sinai last October that hit the tourism industry, a key pillar of the country's economy.\n\n(Reporting by Yara Bayoumy; Writing by Eric Knecht; editing by Ralph Boulton)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/04/16/Egypt-delays-international-bond-issuance-not-talks-IMF", "site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "type": "article", "description": "Egypt has been negotiating billions of dollars in aid from various lenders to help rev", "title": "Egypt delays international bond issuance, is not in talks with IMF"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/04/16/Egypt-delays-international-bond-issuance-not-talks-IMF", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "Egypt has been negotiating billions of dollars in aid from various lenders to help rev", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "The North African country has repeatedly delayed a return to international debt markets after selling its first international bond in five years last June.\nAsked whether Egypt had begun discussions for a similar IMF loan, Garhy said \"not yet\".\nGarhy expects the economy to grow between 4 and 4.2 percent during the current fiscal year with an increase in foreign direct investment.\n\"This will depend on the state of the market, the pricing, and the timing for which we would need this type of funding,\" he said.\nEgypt's economy grew by about 4.1 percent last fiscal year."}
