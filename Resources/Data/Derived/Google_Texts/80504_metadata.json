The clean slate offers voters two dramatically different options for the future. Gary Palmer, a right-wing policy wonk on the GOP tip, embodies the Tea Party\u2019s vacillation between ideology and idiocy. Mark Lester, former assistant U.S. attorney and current history professor at Birmingham-Southern College is all about\u2026well, we visited the candidate on campus last week to determine that.\n\nWeld: You\u2019ve got a good life, a great family, a lovely wife \u2014 what crazy compulsion would make an otherwise sane individual want to go to Washington, D.C. to represent the Sixth District?\n\nML: There were two things that came up. The first was, when Gary Palmer won the Republican nomination. I, along with a lot of other people, had assumed it would be Paul DeMarco, a moderate sort of Republican. \u2026 I know the Sixth is one of the most Republican districts in the country. I was shocked when Palmer, being as extreme as he is, got that nomination. But there wasn\u2019t much anyone could do about it. The Democrats had Avery Vise, who\u2019s a very nice guy, but I think he was there just so the Democrats would have a name upon the ballot. He thought he was going to be running against DeMarco, and running against a moderate Republican, you don\u2019t have any chance in the Sixth District. So, when Avery withdrew, it caught my attention. Then some people came to me and said, you\u2019ve got to step in, Palmer only got 12 percent of the registered voters to get that nomination, we\u2019ve got to have a moderate choice to give the people one more chance not to send this guy to Washington. So I said, yeah, I\u2019ll get in it. I\u2019ll give this a shot.\n\nWell, it was sort of getting on a horse I didn\u2019t realize would take off. I started raising money very quickly. I\u2019m convinced this is going to be a very close race, and the reason is because \u2014 even though I have the (D) by my name \u2014 I am the moderate in the race. This is not an extremist district. It is a moderate district. That\u2019s where I think I have a window to win this thing.\n\nWeld: Can you exploit the schism among local Republicans and turn out disgruntled DeMarco voters?\n\nML: Yes. Over and over again, people have come up to me and said, I\u2019m a moderate Republican and I\u2019m supporting you. Now, these are people who are not going to want their name on an ad, they\u2019re not giving me money (because anything above $250 has to be reported), but they are coming up to me and saying, you have my support.\n\nI think they\u2019re very angry about what the Tea Party has been doing to the Republican Party. Already, Gary has gone to Washington, has met with Speaker [of the House John] Boehner and told him he wasn\u2019t going to support him as Speaker. I can\u2019t believe he would do that. He\u2019s already aligned himself with 10 or 15 of the really extreme Tea Party Republicans, they\u2019ve already contributed to his campaign. I told somebody the other day, if I\u2019m elected, the very first call I would make the next day would be to Speaker Boehner. I\u2019d say, look, in a way I knocked off this Tea Party guy for you, and I want to work with you. I think that could get a lot more done than aligning yourself with extremists.\n\nWeld: Is your centrism based in any way on the Arkansas politics of the Clinton family?\n\nML: Yes, it is. I was very much a Clinton Democrat. My wife [Jeanne Jackson, president and CEO of The Women\u2019s Fund of Greater Birmingham] actually worked in Clinton\u2019s first administration when he was governor. She was the liaison for all departments that dealt with the environment. So, yes, I would put myself as a kind of Clinton moderate, a more fiscally conservative Democrat.\n\nWeld: In the 20 years since Newt Gingrich led the radical insurgency in the U.S. House, the negotiating power of a centrist moderate Democrat has dwindled considerably. Given the structure of the House these days, what leverage would a moderate Democrat have?\n\nML: First, let me give you a little background, and then I\u2019ll answer your question. The problem, of course, is the gerrymandering of districts, both by Democrats and Republicans. [Republicans] are worried about being attacked in their primaries, so they swing as far as they can to avoid that primary attack. Then they go to Washington and they can\u2019t work together because they\u2019re so nervous about being attacked by their own party.\n\nIf I pull off this election, it would be national news that a Democrat had won in one of the most Republican districts in the country. That would give me a moment of opportunity, where maybe I can begin to lead a group that says we want to work with the Republicans. Here\u2019s the real problem. If the Republicans gain the Senate, my fear is that they would just start passing legislation that President Obama is just going to veto, so that nothing gets done.\n\nWeld: Would that be any different than the intransigence of Boehner\u2019s House currently?\n\nML: The reason Boehner hasn\u2019t been able to work is because he can\u2019t control his caucus, because of these Tea Party people. That is the problem. So, again, as a freshman congressman in a minority party, I\u2019m not going to be up there changing Washington. But I might have an opportunity right at the first to reach out and touch base with some people and convince the Republicans to get something together, rather than just passing legislation that\u2019s going to be vetoed.\n\nWeld: What shape is the Sixth District in after 11 terms of Spencer Bachus?\n\nML: Congressman Bachus is somewhat of a moderate. I don\u2019t believe, and you may need to check me on this, I don\u2019t believe he has endorsed Palmer. [As of our deadline, we could locate no such endorsement.] I don\u2019t believe Senator Shelby has endorsed him. [Ditto.] Bachus is a Republican, he\u2019s with the party and that sort of thing, but he did some things, like Bread for the World [an anti-hunger initiative ], he got very interested in that and he\u2019s done a lot for helping keep money for research into disease going, so he\u2019s done some things that I would consider moderate. He hasn\u2019t been an extremist. And I don\u2019t think he approves of the Tea Party\u2019s way of doing things.\n\nWeld: Let\u2019s compare how you and Gary Palmer stand on the issues. Your esteemed opponent, right at the top of his website, wants to repeal Obamacare.\n\nML: The problem with our healthcare system is not Obamacare. We had tremendous problems with the system before Obamacare and we still have plenty of problems with it. What I have found when I\u2019ve been out campaigning is that when you talk about the elements of Obamacare, individually, people are very much in favor of it. There are some very good things that Obamacare has done; for example, putting ranges where the premium dollar has to go for healthcare. If the company does not fall within that range, they have to return part of the premium. Most people think that\u2019s a good idea. Obviously, insurance for people who have pre-existing conditions; that tends to be very, very popular.\n\nWhen you break down the elements, that\u2019s what is helping. Now, the fundamental problem with our healthcare system, that we have not addressed yet: we have got to put more, in my opinion, economic incentives in healthcare. When I go to the hospital, I\u2019m fortunate. I have insurance. I don\u2019t care what anything costs, that economic incentive is totally taken away from me. Whatever it costs, insurance pays for it.\n\nWe have got to get control of these costs, and the only way to do that is to see that people have some sort of economic incentive. I\u2019ve seen where a mammogram in one state costs $500 and in another state it costs $1,700. It\u2019s the same procedure. That\u2019s ridiculous. We\u2019ve got the most expensive and complicated healthcare system in the world. If you take what we spend on health care, you can combine the next 10 nations and we spend more than they spend. We spend 17 percent of our Gross Domestic Product. That is not sustainable. We\u2019ve got to bring that down.\n\nWeld: Would a single-payer system have appealed to you had you been in office during the debate on affordable healthcare?\n\nML: A lot of Democrats supported the single payer system. What Obama was trying to do was to compromise, and use Romney\u2019s plan from Massachusetts. What I don\u2019t understand is why Republicans turned against this so much, because it was a kind of merger of the single-payer system and private insurance. Realistically, if we are going to get down our costs, we\u2019ve got to have a system that includes everyone. We cannot have free riders who stay out of the system until they get really sick and then they come into the system, going to the emergency room or whatever, and we wind up paying their healthcare costs. Everybody has to be in the system if we\u2019re ever going to get control of the costs.\n\nWeld: Meanwhile, Obamacare seems to have lost its allure as a campaign issue, at least among thinking Republicans, mostly because people like it too much.\n\nML: It\u2019s not going to be repealed. But it\u2019s a way for them to say, this is how we\u2019re going to solve the problem, we\u2019re going to repeal Obamacare. That would not solve our healthcare problem.\n\nWeld: Let\u2019s switch topics. Your esteemed opponent thinks that Common Core is a way for the federal government to take over our local schools.\n\nML: That is absurd. I don\u2019t know how to say it any other way. That is the myth that is out there, that he is perpetuating, that in some way Common Core is the federal government telling teachers what they should teach. It is not that at all\u2026as a nation, if we are to remain competitive, we have got to raise the standards of our students. In my 23 years of teaching college, I have seen a real decline in the preparation of high school students, and we have got to get a hold of that.\n\nWe talk about wanting to bring in jobs, industry and that sort of thing into the Sixth District? You\u2019ve got to have an educated work force, and we\u2019ve got to have standards. Some teachers favor Common Core, some don\u2019t, but anything that is raising our level, our standards, I\u2019m absolutely in favor.\n\nWeld: Speaking of workers, your esteemed opponent is opposed to amnesty for undocumented workers, mostly immigrants.\n\nML: Again, that is a slogan, it\u2019s not an answer, to say no amnesty. Okay, if you have no amnesty, what is your plan? We have approximately 11 million undocumented people in the country today. We\u2019re not about to ship them out, so we have to have some sort of pathway to citizenship. What we don\u2019t want, under any circumstances, is two levels of citizenship, where you have kind of \u201creal citizens\u201d and \u201csub-citizens.\u201d That is horrible for a democracy.\n\nI think we could do a better job policing our borders, but as far as those who are here, we\u2019ve got to move toward making sure they pay their taxes and that they\u2019re on a pathway to be full citizens. But saying \u201cno amnesty\u201d \u2014 so what? What does that get you?\n\nWeld: In your TV ad \u2014 which, in the spirit of full disclosure, I picked out the music for \u2014 you speak positively about women\u2019s issues. To a lot of people, Gary Palmer is like kryptonite to women\u2019s rights. Is it possible for you to win the Sixth District through women\u2019s votes?\n\nML: It absolutely is, and the reason is, if you look at the demographics, the census data nationwide (but it\u2019s true in the Sixth District, too), what a lot of people don\u2019t realize is that the idea of the husband being the primary breadwinner and the wife being at home caring for the children is just not America anymore. The statistics show that, of all households that have children, in 40 percent of them the wife is the primary, or the only, breadwinner.\n\nIf your idea of the home is having the woman at home, it is easy to oppose equal pay for women, because the woman should be at home. If your idea is that the woman should be at home, then, of course, you are not going to support quality pre-K programs, because your idea is that they should be done at home. Their whole idea there is not representative of a huge section of America, and that\u2019s the reason a lot of women are for me and are supporting me. But even women at home believe in fundamental fairness for women in the workplace\u2026the median salary for women is 81 percent of what the median salary is for men. We still have this discrepancy.\n\nThe Violence Against Women Act \u2014 that was supported by Senator Shelby. That was supported by Congressman Bachus. A lot of Republicans supported it. It has been tremendously successful. Violence against women has been reduced by 67 percent. The hot line that it established gets 22,000 calls a month, and it went up 80 percent when this Ray Rice thing came up, because, I think, a lot of women said, I\u2019m not going to put up with this anymore, and I\u2019m going to get some help. Why would you want to de-fund something that has proven to be so successful?\n\nWeld: You mention extremism in your TV ad, speaking of \u201cextremists on both sides.\u201d Whom would you characterize as extremists in the Democratic Party?\n\nML: That\u2019s a good question. I don\u2019t have an answer to that off the top of my head. I\u2019m sure there are some from gerrymandered Democratic districts who are nervous about an attack from the left, but, no, I don\u2019t have any names off the top of my head.\n\nWeld: How would you characterize your relationship with the Alabama Democratic Party?\n\nML: I did not know the Alabama Democratic Party, because I had not been involved in politics at all here in Alabama. Once we moved here and I changed careers to become a college professor, I really didn\u2019t get involved, so, to be honest with you, I don\u2019t really know the Alabama Democratic Party that well. I went down to Montgomery, they gave me their nomination, they have been very supportive and encouraging. I know people say there are problems within the party, but I sort of have a luxury, I guess, of not knowing the ins and outs.\n\nWeld: How do you fit in campaigning with your full-time job at Birmingham-Southern?\n\nML: I just have to be very careful with my time. I\u2019ve only had to cancel one class this term, and I\u2019m caught up with my grading. I spend 18-hour days, I\u2019m prepping my classes sometimes late at night for the next day, I have no real leisure time, but these are classes I\u2019ve taught before and I\u2019m familiar with. But it\u2019s been a lot of fun. A lot of students and former students have gotten involved with the campaign, worked on the phone banks, and it\u2019s been wonderful reconnecting with former students.\n\nWeld: What kind of response have you received out in the far-flung parts of the district?\n\nML: People have been very polite and nice. I\u2019ve had only one or two occasions when I felt somebody was being rude to me. Everybody says thank you very much, I\u2019ll look this over. Campaigning has actually been a lot of fun. I had really hoped that there would be more candidate forums, maybe not in the form of a debate, but where Gary and I could get up and present our views. I\u2019ve searched for them, but there just aren\u2019t many candidate forums. Of course, the YWCA and the Junior League issued an invitation for us to debate, and he didn\u2019t accept and I did. He wouldn\u2019t even appear at the editorial board of al.com at the same time with me.\n\nThere are some things he does not want me pointing out. The principal one is the financing of his campaign. I\u2019ve raised over $125,000, all from individuals. I\u2019ve had one PAC contribution, and it was from the railroad employees, and we all know who they are.\n\nAnother thing I did was, when I announced, I produced all of my tax returns for the last five years, so everyone can see my W-2 from Birmingham-Southern College, and I get income from investments like everyone. I challenged Gary, and the reason I challenged him to produce his income tax returns is that the House of Representatives requires that you give your sources of income for the last two years. That report shows that, in one year, he received $35,000, and in the second year, $40,000 from a special interest called American Majority Action, which amounted to 25 percent of his income. We\u2019re not talking about campaign contributions. This is money you buy your groceries with\u2026then I said he should reveal who the contributors are to the Alabama Policy Institute that\u2019s been paying his salary for the last 20 years. He won\u2019t do that.\n\nThe Nation did an article on my race, where they looked into Gary Palmer\u2019s contributions and where they were coming from. These things are very difficult to pin down, but\u2026I think, probably, Gary has received about half of his money from the Koch brothers, one way or another. He\u2019s very much tied in with them.\n\nThere are going to be some IOUs there, and that\u2019s why I\u2019m very excited, if I can pull this off, that I really would be able to go up there beholden to absolutely none of [the special interests].\n\nWeld: And to pull this off, getting out the vote is absolutely crucial. How do you go about doing that?\n\nML: I like to think we have a very, very sophisticated ground game. We have been working phone banks for about five weeks. We\u2019re doing about a thousand calls a day. We will identify by Election Day who my supporters are, so that will make for a very effective Get Out The Vote. So I\u2019m feeling very good about our ground game. Right now, I\u2019ve got to raise more money to put into ads on social media. I wasn\u2019t able to budget that at first, because I had to budget for TV.\n\nWeld: Does advertising on social media translate into actual votes?\n\nML: I think the verdict is still out on that, but what piqued my attention was that, in these very close Senate races across the country, they have totally bought out social media. So what I\u2019m doing is piggybacking on that. They must have smart people running those campaigns. \u2026\n\nThe excitement is definitely getting out there. I do think that I\u2019m the campaign in this area that\u2019s getting the interest. When I first got into this race, nobody was thinking about an election much. That\u2019s been the advantage of a short campaign for me; I didn\u2019t have to pay for a staff for a year.\n\nWhere I think I\u2019m going to surprise some people is \u2014 no Democrat has ever raised this much money in the Sixth District. You mark my words: there is going to be a recount in this election. Either I will barely win it, and he will want a recount, or he will barely win it and I\u2019ll want a recount. It is going to be that close. Every single vote will count. That\u2019s what\u2019s going to be really exciting Election Night.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Weld for Birmingham", "description": "Mark Lester offers a lesson in democracy to the 6th District.", "title": "The present-minded professor", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 3600, "identifier": "http://weldbham.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Mark_Lester_0091-3.jpg", "height": 2400}, "url": "http://weldbham.com/blog/2014/10/29/the-present-minded-professor-mark-lester-gary-palmer-al06/", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 199569796846147}, "template": "WeldBham 1.0", "google-site-verification": "878969361de6ef4b", "article": {"section": "News & Views", "tag": "politics", "published_time": "2014-10-30T02:06:59+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-10-30T02:06:59+00:00", "author": "http://weldbham.com/blog/author/courtney/"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde622\"", "article_summary": "Where I think I\u2019m going to surprise some people is \u2014 no Democrat has ever raised this much money in the Sixth District.\nHe\u2019s already aligned himself with 10 or 15 of the really extreme Tea Party Republicans, they\u2019ve already contributed to his campaign.\nSo, again, as a freshman congressman in a minority party, I\u2019m not going to be up there changing Washington.\nAnd I don\u2019t think he approves of the Tea Party\u2019s way of doing things.\nOver and over again, people have come up to me and said, I\u2019m a moderate Republican and I\u2019m supporting you."}
