Ms. Miller has been charged with bankruptcy fraud after a judge discovered the possibility while channel-surfing. Rich Fury/Associated Press\n\nA Pennsylvania judge realized that bankruptcy fraud may have been unfolding in his own courtroom while channel-surfing.\n\nThe grand-jury indictment of \u201cDance Moms\u201d star Abby Lee Miller, who is accused of hiding payments she got from her appearance on the reality TV show, traces back to a night in January 2013 when Judge Thomas Agresti came across Ms. Miller\u2019s \u201cUltimate Dance Competition\u201d on television, according to court papers.\n\nMs. Miller had filed for bankruptcy in December 2010, facing $356,466.52 in debt, according to documents filed in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Pittsburgh. Her lawyers had said in early court papers that Ms. Miller had the potential to profit from the show, but money from those appearances wasn\u2019t disclosed in the monthly reports that documented her income.\n\nAt one point in 2010, Ms. Miller told a court official that the reality show would bring in publicity \u201cbut no separate TV revenue,\u201d according to court papers.\n\nMs. Miller told Judge Agresti that she could only afford to pay back a portion of the money she owes just a few weeks before the channel-surfing moment aired on television.\n\n\u201cI realized that there\u2019s an awful lot of money coming into this plan\u2014this case\u2014and it hasn\u2019t been disclosed,\u201d said Judge Agresti said of that moment, according to a transcript of a Feb. 1, 2013, hearing.\n\nLawyers for Ms. Miller did not immediately return requests for comment.\n\nPrior to the disclosure of the TV show money, Judge Agresti had scolded Ms. Miller for filing late court documents and for her courtroom behavior.\n\n\u201cMa\u2019am, be quiet. When I speak to you, you can talk. We\u2019re not on a reality show. We\u2019re in reality, but it\u2019s not a TV show, okay, where you get to be the prima donna and the diva. You\u2019re a debtor in this court and you\u2019re going to observe the rules and responsibilities. Otherwise go ahead and go to Hollywood,\u201d he said during an August 2011 hearing, according to a transcript.\n\nMs. Miller, 50 years old, was indicted by a federal grand jury in Pittsburgh on bankruptcy fraud charges which accused her of hiding $288,137.57 in TV show money she earned in 2012, according to the indictment.\n\nMs. Miller told Hollywood officials to withhold paychecks and to direct some of the money to her mother, according to the 20-count indictment that was returned by the grand jury on Tuesday. The indictment also accuses her of failing to disclose ticket sales to dance classes and apparel sold on AbbyLeeDanceCompany.com.\n\nMs. Miller wrote an email to her accountant with the subject line \u201cLETS MAKE MONEY AND KEEP ME OUT OF JAIL,\u201d according to the indictment.\n\nIn all, the 34-page indictment accused Ms. Miller of concealing $755,492.85.\n\n\u201cCriminal prosecution is appropriate when debtors corrupt the bankruptcy process through deceit and lies before the court,\u201d U.S. Attorney David J. Hickton said.\n\nWrite to Katy Stech at katy.stech@wsj.com.
