Mike Conaway says he has the accomplishments and experience to retain his 11th District seat in the U.S. House.\n\nWade Brown, Conaway\u2019s Republican challenger in the March primary, thinks he can do a better job at representing the will of the constituents here.\n\nBrown criticized Conaway at a candidate forum in January for his voting record. Conaway defended his record.\n\nThe two square off in the Republican Primary on March 4. Brown ran, and lost, in the same primary in 2012. The winner of the primary will face Libertarian Ryan T. Lange in the general election in the fall.\n\nBorn in Big Lake and now living in May in Brown County, Brown turns 44 on Tuesday. He describes himself as a constitutional conservative running on the Republican ticket, and said he finds common ground with the Tea Party\u2019s views about the role of government.\n\nHe fills in as a Bible study teacher at his church and has a business partnership of a hay farm and also buys and sells land.\n\n\u201cI have people who help me with that,\u201d he said, adding that he still serves as a Marine officer in the reserves. He left active duty in 2011 and touts his experience in the military as an important qualification.\n\nHe explained why he thinks he\u2019s qualified to be the new representative for District 11.\n\n\u201cThere are a couple of important aspects of being a Congressman,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to have had experience making important decisions about policy and law and regulation. I\u2019ve actually been in charge of policy oversight for about 25 percent of the Marine Corps\u2019 ground combat equipment in the past. I have not only overviewed policy, but I have written it. I\u2019ve also written classified operations orders that were used in real word environments with counter-insurgency and counter-piracy.\u201d\n\nHe said those aspects of the job affect people\u2019s lives, and depending on the type of policy or regulation you write, \u201cit can have very far-reaching effects.\u201d He said he has experience leading a staff and knows how to work with people.\n\nBrown said a representative also must possess the ability to work with people from a variety of cultures and backgrounds, and he thinks his time in the service gives him experience in that regard.\n\nConaway said he hopes people here will continue to give him their trust.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been doing the job they\u2019ve wanted me to do now for nine years, and I certainly intend to keep doing that,\u201d Conaway said. \u201cI\u2019ve gained a great deal of experience throughout that process. It\u2019s now time to harvest that experience: Can you work for the folks in District 11? I have earned the trust and confidence of my colleagues to be put in leadership positions.\u201d\n\nConaway discussed his three chairmanships \u2014 ethics committee, a subcommittee in the agriculture committee and the intelligence committee \u2014 said he will continue to use the \u201csame work ethic, decision-making process that I\u2019ve been using to create one of the most conservative voting records in Congress over the nine years for the folks in District 11.\u201d\n\nHe said he intends to be the next chairman of the House Agriculture Committee. Having people in chairmanships from Texas is important, as it will have the potential to have six different whole committee gavels next year.\n\n\u201cI intend to be one of those if I can get folks in District 11 to re-elect me one more time,\u201d he said.\n\nBrown said the district\u2019s predominantly rural composition also helps him because of his small-town background.\n\n\u201cI think I live and breathe sort of our 11th District way of living more than my opponent does, by far,\u201d Brown said. \u201cI\u2019m in and out and among the people on a daily basis. I am one of the people, so that\u2019s an intangible. But it\u2019s important, because I know how much a gallon of gas costs \u2014 I know where the cheapest gas in town is. I know what a gallon of milk costs. These things have an impact on me and my family and the people of my community.\u201d\n\nHe said many people he hires and works with on a daily basis live paycheck-to-paycheck, and that\u2019s the norm for many people in this district.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m actually able to be in touch with the sentiments and values of the people of our district,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said this district needs new blood in Washington.\n\n\u201cWe need a complete fresh viewpoint and a willingness to act at the national level,\u201d Brown said.\n\nHe said the local level candidates have talked in public forums about how the federal government has been intruding on their local decision-making. He said as the Affordable Care Act is one example.\n\n\u201cThe representative we have now does not even stick with his own party\u2019s platform,\u201d he said, noting the platform opposes bailouts and \u201cwe know that Mike Conaway voted for the largest bailout in U.S. history. That\u2019s a fact. It\u2019s not spin, it\u2019s not twisting his record around \u2014 it\u2019s just a fact.\u201d\n\nHe mentioned the national debt, too, explaining that lawmakers must hold the line and force a balanced budget. He said Conaway has been in a habit of voting for bills to increase the debt.\n\nConaway disputes Brown\u2019s characterization, as he has voted more than 6,800 times in Congress, and \u201cany challenger can cherry-pick issues within issues\u201d to say that the elected official is not representing the wishes of the constituency.\n\n\u201cThe Omnibus bill, for nothing else, prevents the president from bringing the Guantanamo Bay prisoners \u2014 the worst of the worst of the Islamic jihadists that we have in Guantanamo Bay \u2014 to the United States,\u201d Conaway said. \u201cSo by extension, my opponent then would argue that those prisoners should be brought to the United States. We cut spending for the fourth year in a row, puts us back to the 2009 level. It fixed the disabled military retirees\u2019 (pension program). So, apparently, my opponent is not in favor of fixing the military retirees\u2019 pension plan, if he\u2019s going to cherry pick like that. And he\u2019s choosing to do that.\u201d\n\nBrown said the nation is in a \u201cconstitutional crisis\u201d and doesn\u2019t like how President Barack Obama vows to bypass Congress to enact measures if need be. Conaway won\u2019t stand up to Obama, Brown said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m concerned about doing the right thing. Period. End of story,\u201d Brown said. \u201cWhen the president gets out of bounds, you check the president. That\u2019s the role of the other branches of government, to check the other branches. Certainly, the House is failing to do that. Mr. Conaway is line with the rest of the House\u2019s actions, or the lack of action.\u201d\n\nConaway, though, takes issue with Obama\u2019s leadership. This next session is \u201cgoing to be a continuation of divided government,\u201d Conaway predicts.\n\n\u201cThe president is not going to lead this nation the way he should,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s not going to provide that kind of united leadership that\u2019s essential for divided government to work. The last time divided government worked well was with Reagan.\u201d\n\nBy contrast, Obama has not led for five years, Conaway said, and Conaway doesn\u2019t anticipate he will lead for the next three years.\n\n\u201cThis coming year, the last year of this session, we will be limited as to what we can do in terms of the big deal,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said there exists a long list of items that should be done \u2014 balanced budget amendment, stripping spending, reduction of entitlement, revamping of the tax code and immigration reform \u2014 but he doesn\u2019t have much optimism because Obama won\u2019t lead. He thinks it\u2019s important that Americans elect a GOP majority in the Senate this fall so that Republicans can weaken the president.\n\nRepublicans will continue to pass bills in the House to \u201chelp show the American people a better way forward, a brighter future for this country, a more imaginative world that we could live in if we had some help in the Senate and a different kind of White House,\u201d Conaway said.\n\nHe lauded the recently passed farm bill because it was good for production of agriculture and because it produces modest reforms in the food stamp program.\n\nBrown pledges to serve as a Congressman \u201creceiving only the salary and benefits were I still on active duty.\u201d He said he will serve for about half pay and will not participate in the Congressional retirement system. He would not take lesser pay as a symbolic gesture, but thinks other lawmakers should do the same. He said he would encourage others in Congress to reduce their own pay.\n\n\u201cLeadership is servant-hood and sacrifice,\u201d he said. \u201cThose are two absolutely essential elements in any true leadership.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "Odessa American", "description": "U.S. Rep.
