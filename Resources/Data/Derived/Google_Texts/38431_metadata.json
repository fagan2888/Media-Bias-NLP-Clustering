Most teams need to devote additional resources to slow said star. So, double-teams, zone-ish or straight-up zone defenses, multiple eyes on the star, etc. Problem is, that distorts a team\u2019s ability to defend everyone else on the court with the star. Be bold enough to defend that star one-on-one, and that star might burn you in the end.\n\nThe Nuggets face the star of all stars on Tuesday night in Cleveland\u2019s LeBron James. They\u2019ll have a plan for James, and that plan will have to carry through four quarters. Especially the fourth quarter. During this stretch where the Nuggets have lost five of their last six games, star players have repeatedly hurt the Nuggets in the fourth quarter, when games have been in the balance.\n\nThey\u2019ll be looking to buck this troubling trend:\n\nDec. 20 vs. New Orleans: In the final 8:20 of the game, Pelicans star Anthony Davis had eight points, four rebounds and four blocked shots. New Orleans outscored the Nuggets 26-19 in that span \u2014 a seven-point differential in a five-point, 130-125 loss.\n\nDec. 22 vs. L.A. Lakers: Kobe Bryant scored 11 of his 31 points in the fourth quarter of the Lakers 111-107 win over the Nuggets. Additionally, Bryant impacted the game defensively as he guarded one of the Nuggets\u2019 biggest scoring threats, guard Will Barton.\n\nDec. 27 vs. Oklahoma City: Thunder stars Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook combined for 11 points, three rebounds and two assists in the final 9:10 of the game, a stretch where Oklahoma City outscored the Nuggets 28-17, an 11-point bulge in a 10-point win.\n\nFollow Chris Dempsey on Twitter @dempseypost or email him at cdempsey@denverpost.com", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Anthony Davis,Denver Nuggets,Kevin Durant,Kobe Bryant,LeBron James,NBA,Russell Westbrook", "language": "en, sv", "og": {"site_name": "Nuggets Ink", "description": "During this stretch where the Nuggets have lost five of their last six games, star players have repeatedly hurt the Nuggets in the fourth quarter, when games have been in the balance.", "title": "Stars flexing muscles on Nuggets in recent fourth quarters", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/nuggets/2015/12/29/denver-nuggets-lebron-james/13610/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/nuggets/files/2015/12/LEBRONMUSCLES-495x330.jpg", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "description": "During this stretch where the Nuggets have lost five of their last six games, star players have repeatedly hurt the Nuggets in the fourth quarter, when games have been in the balance.", "title": "Star players flexing muscles on Nuggets in recent fourth quarters", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/nuggets/2015/12/29/denver-nuggets-lebron-james/13610/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/nuggets/files/2015/12/LEBRONMUSCLES-495x330.jpg", "creator": "@dempseyPost", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "During this stretch, where the Nuggets have lost five of their last six games, star players have hurt the Nuggets in the fourth quarter."}, "article_summary": "Especially the fourth quarter.\nDec. 22 vs. L.A.
