ATLANTA -- Two-thirds of patients with newly diagnosed invasive cancer reach the key 5-year survival landmark, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

Among patients with invasive cancers diagnosed during 2003 to 2010, 65% remained alive 5 years or longer after diagnosis. The 5-year survival exceeded 60% for three of the four most common cancers: prostate (97%), breast cancer (88%), and colorectal (63%).

Lung cancer continued to lag far behind with a 5-year survival of 18%, as reported in Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report. Men and women alike had similar survival, but racial disparities persisted, as fewer blacks reached the 5-year survival mark compared with whites.

"These data are an important reminder that a key to surviving with cancer is making sure that everyone has access to care from early diagnosis to treatment," Lisa Richardson, MD, director of the CDC Division of Cancer Prevention and Control, said in a statement. "We know, for example, that early detection of colorectal cancer has had the largest impact on long-term survival rates."

Much of the credit for improved 5-year survival should go to screening programs and effective diagnostic tests, said Julie M. Vose, MD, president-elect of the American Society of Clinical Oncology.

"The screening done for many of the malignancies has improved over the last few years, and thanks to the Affordable Care Act, it is now covered for many people," Vose, of the University of Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha, told MedPage Today in an email. "This will definitely help in years to come to decrease the 5-year mortality, as many of the common cancers can be caught with early screening and therefore detected at an earlier stage with resultant better outcomes."

The survival findings came from an analysis of data for 2011 from the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results registries and the CDC's National Program of Cancer Registries. Previous reviews of cancer incidence had not included survival data, S. Jane Henley, MSPH, also of the CDC Division of Cancer Prevention and Control, and co-authors noted in their introduction. The figures represented relative survival, as calculated from comparisons with same-age individuals without cancer.

In addition to documenting overall epidemiologic trends, the investigators sought to determine states' progress toward meeting incidence goals set by Healthy People 2020 for cervical and colorectal cancer.

The analysis showed that 1,532,066 invasive cancers were diagnosed in 2011. Men (786,102) and women (745,964) accounted for similar proportions of the total. The total number of cases translated into an age-adjusted rate of 451 per 100,000 population, including 508/100,00 among men and 410/100,000 among women. The rate ranged from 18/100,000 for people younger than 20 to 154, 816, 1,840, and 2,223/100,000 for age groups 20 to 49, 50 to 64, 65 to 74, and 75 or older.

Geographically, cancer rates varied by as much as 135/100,000. The highest rates (475 to 509/100,000) tended to occur in the Northeast, with some spread into the Southeast, plus Wisconsin. The lowest rates (374 to 435/100,000) clustered in the West, plus Arkansas, Virginia, and Florida. Similar variability existed with respect to specific cancer sites, and the variability did not coincide with the overall geographic distribution of cancer.

The four most common types of cancer accounted for more than half of the 2011 total: 209,292 cases of prostate cancer, 220,097 female breast cancers, 207,339 lung cancers, and 135,260 cases of colorectal cancer.

HealthyPeople 2020, an initiative of the Department of Health and Human Services, has established prevention goals for several types of cancer, including cervical and colorectal. The CDC analysis examined the progress individual states have made toward reaching the goals by 2020. The incidence goal for cervical cancer is a reduction from 8.3/100,000 (adjusted national baseline for the year 2000) to 7.5/100,000. The goal for colorectal cancer incidence is a reduction from an adjusted national baseline rate of 48.9/100,000 to 41.6/100,000.

The CDC analysis showed 37 states have met the incidence goal for cervical cancer, and 28 have met the goal for colorectal cancer. Nationwide, the rates ranged from 33 to 49/100,000 for colorectal cancer and 4.5 to 13.7/100,000 for cervical cancer.

The survival data continued the improvement noted in the 2013 study that showed a 5-year survival of 64%. The highest 5-year survival occurred in patients <45 at diagnosis (81%) and decreased with age thereafter. Even so, more than half of patients â‰¥75 lived at least 5 years after diagnosis. Vose suggested the potential for continued improvement with greater access to screening and diagnosis programs.

"Some of the screening techniques, such as colonoscopy, are still not that widely done, both due to the physicians not recommending them and the patients not wanting to do them or not having it easily available," she said. "Hopefully with time, new techniques will become more common, less invasive, and more helpful for screening large patient volumes."

Men and women had an identical 5-year survival of 65%. However, whites fared better than blacks did (65% versus 60%).

The study was supported by the CDC. The authors disclosed no relevant relationships with industry.
