More than 300 classic cars will be on display from 8 a.m. to 3 p.m. Sunday as Channel Islands Harbor hosts Ventura Vintage Rods’ Harbor Run 24 in Harborview Park.

Classic cars from before 1975 — street rods to muscle cars, customs to pickups — will be at the Oxnard show. There’s no cost to attend, but there is a $30 fee to enter a vintage car in the event, plus registrants are asked to bring two canned food items to be donated to FOOD Share of Ventura County.

Several trophies will be handed out, and food vendors will be set up throughout the park.

Last year’s Vintage Rods’ Harbor Run raised about $15,000, all of which was donated to local charities.
