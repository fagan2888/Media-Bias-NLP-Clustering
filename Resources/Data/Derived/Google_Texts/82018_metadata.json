Todd C. Young (R-Ind.), the lead sponsor of the proposal, said the reductions in work hours unfairly target lower-wage workers whom the law was designed to help.\n\n\u201cThese are cafeteria workers, these are substitute teachers, these are adjunct professors,\u201d he said this week. \u201cThese are folks who help us in terms of serving at restaurants. On balance, these are folks who can least afford to see a cut in their take-home pay. And so we want to restore the 40-hour workweek.\u201d\n\nObama threatened to veto the House bill this week, citing a recent report by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office that said about that1 million people would lose employer-backed coverage and that the number of uninsured would climb by almost 500,000 if the law\u2019s work definitions were changed. And most congressional Democrats, buoyed by the new enrollment figures, said Thursday that Republicans were merely bending to the will of companies who are using the new law as an excuse to cut workers\u2019 hours and pay.\n\nGraphic The ACA's 21 deadline extensions A look back at every Affordable Care Act deadline that was extended by the Obama administration.\n\n\u201cIt is not Obamacare that decides how much somebody works, it\u2019s the person who runs the company,\u201d Rep. James McDermott (D-Wash.) said Thursday.\n\nThe law passed 248 to 179. All voting Republicans were joined by 18 Democrats, most of whom have voted repeatedly in recent months to approve GOP-backed measures that would repeal all or parts of the health-care law. The group includes Democrats most at risk of losing reelection this year, including Reps. Ron Barber (Ariz.), Ami Bera (Calif.), Patrick Murphy (Fla.) and Nick J. Rahall II (W. Va.).\n\nThursday\u2019s vote marked the 55th time the GOP-led House has voted to scale back all or parts of the law \u2014 and it won\u2019t be the last. When the White House announced Monday that more than 7 million Americans had enrolled in health-care coverage, Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) vowed that \u201cHouse Republicans will continue to work to repeal this law.\u201d\n\nAhead of the vote, Republicans repeatedly cited the concerns of the service industry, a job sector that has continued hiring despite the fragile economic recovery. The American Hotel and Lodging Association complained Thursday that the law is affecting the already-complicated process of scheduling workers to staff hotels 24 hours a day. And the National Restaurant Association, a powerful Washington lobby, warned lawmakers Thursday that changing the law\u2019s work rules \u201cwould help avoid any unnecessary disruptions to employees\u2019 wages and hours, and would provide significant relief to employers.\u201d\n\nEven though the House measure has little hope for consideration in the Democratic-controlled Senate, some Democratic senators suggested this week that they are open to discussing ways to tweak the health-care law\u2019s work rules. Citing the concerns of restaurateurs, Sen. Richard J. Durbin (Ill.), the chamber\u2019s second-ranking Democrat, told reporters Wednesday that \u201cIf [House Republicans] want to sit down in a constructive bipartisan discussion on that issue, I want to be at the table.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are legitimate concerns expressed in many industries, including restaurants, about how we\u2019re going to define a full-time employee,\u201d Durbin said later. \u201cLet\u2019s sit down and work on it constructively.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Vote tally suggests at least some nervous Democrats may now be more willing to defend the law.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ed-OKeefe/147995121918931", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Vote tally suggests at least some nervous Democrats may now be more willing to defend the law.", "title": "Does a full-time employee work 30 or 40 hours?
