And people often don't know.\n\nBy Joel Mathis and Ben Boychuk\n\nThe 2016 presidential race seems to be well under way without him, but there's talk that Vice President Joe Biden will make a run for the Democratic nomination, challenging front-runner Hillary Clinton.\n\nTalk of a possible candidacy was fueled by Biden's searing appearance on Stephen Colbert's show, in which he talked about the pain of losing his recently deceased son.\n\nWould Biden be a good or a poor presidential candidate? Joel Mathis and Ben Boychuk, the RedBlueAmerica columnists, debate the issue.\n\nJOEL MATHIS\n\nThis is an odd thing to say, but a Joe Biden candidacy might be the closest thing the Democrats could offer to counter Donald Trump.\n\nBiden doesn't share Trump's obnoxious, opportunistic, race-driven populism. But he's similar in that his appeal - to fans, anyway - is that he's, well, unpredictable, and not always beholden to talking points: Biden is the avuncular uncle at Thanksgiving who says what everybody else is thinking. Just like Trump, Biden sometimes offers the thrill of the forbidden.\n\nMORE: Joe Biden is a good Veep, but that doesn't mean he should run (Letters)\n\nSometimes this has helped him be a great public servant. But it would probably make him a bad president.\n\nRemember when President Barack Obama signed the Affordable Care Act? It was Biden who grasped the president and - in the presence of a hot microphone - proclaimed the moment a \"big (expletive) deal.\" He was right!\n\nAnd remember when Biden told the nation that gay marriage should be legal? It was that act that forced President Obama - who had never before supported gay rights to marriage - to follow suit several days later in an interview with ABC's Robin Roberts.\n\nOn the flip side, Biden destroyed his own presidential run - and aided Obama's - in 2008, when he referred to the then-senator as \"articulate and bright and clean,\" a racial faux pas that could've ended his political career if he weren't, well, Joe Biden.\n\nThe vice president's unpredictability, you see, goes both ways: Sometimes it's a force for good. Sometimes not. But that attribute would be unforgivable in a president, an office that demands a level of self-discipline that Biden - God bless him - has never mastered.\n\nIn some ways, that's great: It means our vice president is human, which is a big part of his appeal. But a president's loose lips can sink ships - or at least send stock markets plummeting, or cause diplomatic problems we don't need.\n\nJoe Biden has served his country honorably, and for a long time. His dignity in the face of his son's death is an example to us all. But he shouldn't be president. And he doesn't need to be: His legacy is already assured.\n\nBEN BOYCHUK\n\nJoe Biden would be an exquisite foil, first for the less-than-inevitable Hillary Clinton in pursuit of the Democratic Party's nomination, and then - should he be so fortunate - in a general election fight with just about any Republican. Even Mike Huckabee.\n\nAnd it was impossible not to be moved by Biden's reminiscence with Stephen Colbert about his son Beau, who succumbed to brain cancer last year. But paternal love and Irish sentimentality are not qualifications for the presidency. Americans don't need an affable, gaffe-prone guy in the Oval Office. We need a statesman, or somebody close to one.\n\nThe trouble with Biden is he doesn't know as much as he thinks and doesn't think as much as he knows. Journalist Richard Ben Cramer put it best in his account of the 1988 election, \"What it Takes\": \"Joe often didn't know what he thought until he had to say it.\"\n\nMORE: Joe Biden heads home to Pa. for St. Patrick's Day celebration\n\nThat brings to the time in 2007 when Biden told the late TV newsman Tim Russert, \"I have changed my mind, but I haven't changed my mind in any fundamental way.\" about his support for the Iraq War. Like John Kerry in 2004, Biden was for the war before he was against it.\n\nIt's a basic axiom of our politics: People forget. And people often don't know.\n\nPeople forget about Biden's disgraceful slanders against Robert Bork and his \"high-tech lynching\" of Clarence Thomas when both were nominated for the Supreme Court. Ancient history? Biden showed then, and many times thereafter, that he was not a man of his word and that he would distort and lie about the judicial philosophy of conservative nominees if it suited his agenda.\n\nPeople forget - or do not know - about Biden's lousy judgment. He was alone among President Obama's advisors in urging the president not to order the 2011 raid that ended with the death of Osama bin Laden.\n\nBiden should run so people remember, so they will know. Let him vindicate his terrible judgment and the follies of the administration he's served these seven long years. Let him defend the toothless Iran deal. Let him explain why China and Russia are more belligerent after Obama's two terms. And then let the people decide if affable old Joe deserves to be president.\n\nBen Boychuk (bboychukcity-journal.org) is associate editor of the Manhattan Institute's City Journal.
