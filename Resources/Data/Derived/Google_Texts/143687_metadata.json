The city is bathed in a beautiful late-afternoon light\u2014the kind that makes people rush outside just to enjoy it. But rather than bask in the weather, a small group of expats and Chinese locals have instead chosen to hole themselves up in a caf\u00e9. With screwdrivers in hand, the group hacks away at cheap blue plastic fans. A moment later, they strap onto the fans\u2019 standard issue HEPA filters, gauze-like panels that are as white as bridal veils. In less than five minutes\u2014and for less than $30\u2014they\u2019ve managed to construct an air purifier that the instructor of this DIY workshop claims is just as effective as professional models selling for thousands of dollars. One of the workshop\u2019s participants, a 27-year old PHD student named Gu Yaobao, is particularly pleased with his new machine. \u201cI don\u2019t understand why the professional purifiers have to be so expensive,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve only seen them being sold in the last few years. Before, I had no idea about the effects of pollution on my body. Now I hear about it on the news, all these respiratory diseases it can cause, so I\u2019ve bought plants, facemasks, everything.\u201d\n\nThe Chinese government recently announced that it will invest $275 billion\u2014an amount equivalent to Hong Kong\u2019s GDP\u2014over the next five years to combat air pollution. But many in China aren\u2019t prepared to wait, and are taking matters into their own hands. Nearly 3 million air filters were sold in 2012, an increase of roughly 50 percent on the previous year. And following January\u2019s \u201cairpocalypse\u201d\u2014a particularly nasty stretch of gray skies\u2014demand skyrocketed even further, with the electronics giant Suning reporting that sales of filters rose 170 percent in the first four months of this year from the same period last year. The rush to capitalize on China\u2019s dirty air isn\u2019t limited to large retailers. Small start-ups such as O2ganic promise to \u201cclean air, naturally,\u201d with plant packages that come in a variety of themes, such as \u201cMediterranean\u201d and \u201cNear and Dear.\u201d Thousands more air-filtering plants are hawked by hundreds of small shops on Taobao (China\u2019s version of eBay), with vendors highlighting exactly how many milligrams of indoor pollutants their green specimens can eliminate. Face masks are also popular buys on the e-commerce website and come in a multitude of shapes and styles, from cuddly, fluffy panda faces and cartoon expression protectors to serious black numbers which cover the nose and mouth and make the wearer look like a comic book villain. Some retailers are pushing consumer choice a step further, selling customizable and company-branded anti-pollution masks. One company, PureLiving China, goes even further: They offer to completely pollution-proof offices and homes. For $500 to $800, they will carry out a complete diagnostic assessment of inside air and water quality (\u201cIt\u2019s better to know\u201d, says their tagline) and suggest solutions, ranging from photocatalytic and oxidation treatments to the humble green plant. Founded in 2010 by a Chinese-American, the company initially catered almost exclusively to expats, but in the last six months they have had a flood of inquiries from Chinese families. \u201cIn January, traffic to our website was 30 times the usual,\u201d says company spokesperson James Westwood. \u201cFinally the pollution problem is becoming public knowledge. In the past, people would blame gray skies on fog.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "DIY entrepreneurs have developed ingenious\u2014and affordable\u2014products to satisfy the public&#39;s insatiable demand for pure air.", "author": "Gabrielle Jaffe", "og": {"site_name": "The Atlantic", "description": "DIY entrepreneurs have developed ingenious\u2014and affordable\u2014products to satisfy the public&#39;s insatiable demand for pure air.", "title": "China's Newest Market Opportunity: Pollution Control", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2013/09/gasmaskbanner/lead_large.jpg", "url": "http://www.theatlantic.com/china/archive/2013/09/chinas-newest-market-opportunity-pollution-control/279364/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "theatlantic.com", "site": "@theatlantic", "card": "summary"}, "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "p": {"domain_verify": "68e1a0361a557708fefc992f3309ed70"}, "fb": {"admins": "577048155,17301937", "page_id": 29259828486, "app_id": 100770816677686}, "keywords": "The Atlantic, The Atlantic Magazine, TheAtlantic.com, Atlantic, news, opinion, breaking news, analysis, commentary, business, politics, culture, international, science, technology, national and life", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, width=device-width, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd16b2\"", "article_summary": "Nearly 3 million air filters were sold in 2012, an increase of roughly 50 percent on the previous year.\nOne of the workshop\u2019s participants, a 27-year old PHD student named Gu Yaobao, is particularly pleased with his new machine.\nA moment later, they strap onto the fans\u2019 standard issue HEPA filters, gauze-like panels that are as white as bridal veils.\nThe city is bathed in a beautiful late-afternoon light\u2014the kind that makes people rush outside just to enjoy it.\nBut rather than bask in the weather, a small group of expats and Chinese locals have instead chosen to hole themselves up in a caf\u00e9."}
