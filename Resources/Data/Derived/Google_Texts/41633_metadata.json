That feels strange after so many months of Limbaugh mainstreaming Trump on the right \u2014 as I said in last week\u2019s post, it\u2019s hard to be pro-Trump and pro-Rubio \u2014 but it makes sense strategically. If Rubio collapses, conservatives are left with Cruz and \u2026 that\u2019s pretty much it, given that the other remaining survivors in the field are apt to be Trump, Kasich, and/or Bush. Unless you want to (shudder) take a second look at Jeb, you need Rubio in there in case Cruz hits a wall after the SEC primary. For all his faults, from amnesty to hyper-interventionism to his inability to stray off-script even when he\u2019s being mocked for staying relentlessly on script, Rubio would still be more conservative as president than the rest of his center-right competition. Rush is simply playing the long game here by declining to wreck him for his debate stumble.\n\nAs for the substance of Rubio\u2019s answer, I wouldn\u2019t go as far in claiming that \u201cObama knows what he\u2019s doing.\u201d Domestically, that\u2019s true: ObamaCare wasn\u2019t an accident. It\u2019s true in some foreign policy matters too, like the Iran deal. O succeeded there in his goal of neutralizing the threat, if you define \u201cthe threat\u201d as \u201cAmerican hawks willing to risk war with Iran to stop their nuclear program.\u201d He took war off the table for the foreseeable future, even at the price of legitimizing uranium enrichment by Iran in 15 years\u2019 time. He knew what he was doing. I\u2019ll never buy that he knew what he was doing in Libya and Syria, though. There\u2019s no strategic benefit to setting red lines for Assad on WMD and vowing that Assad must go and then failing to follow through on either of those threats later. It\u2019s pure amateurism, a bluff with nothing behind it, and emblematic of Obama\u2019s short-sighted approach in Syria of doing just enough so that hawks can\u2019t claim he\u2019s doing absolutely nothing while doing little enough that doves can\u2019t claim we\u2019re on our way to Vietnam 3.0. Rubio, I\u2019m sure, does have some concrete ideas about what the commander-in-chief should be doing in Syria. Whether a McCain-ish ramping up of America\u2019s presence in the Syrian maelstrom would be better than Obama\u2019s \u201cstrategy du jour\u201d approach, I leave for you to decide.\n\nAnyway. It\u2019s fine to say, as Rush and Andy McCarthy do, that Rubio was right on the merits of his \u201cObama knows what he\u2019s doing\u201d talking point. The problem, as McCarthy notes, was Rubio\u2019s insistence on mindlessly repeating the point even while being mocked for mindless repetition, as though he couldn\u2019t delve into the substance of it. The point of Christie\u2019s jab was that a freshman senator is too inexperienced to successfully advance his agenda as president, which is really stupid considering that Obama\u2019s actually done it. He got the stimulus through; he got ObamaCare through; he made a dubious deal with Iran and proclaimed a dubious mass amnesty via executive action. Claiming at this point that young legislators can\u2019t move the ball for their team as president is like claiming that it\u2019s scientifically impossible that the sky is blue. Just look up! But rather than say that, Rubio stuck to his script, and as Ace noted yesterday, once you\u2019ve seen the 25-second speech exposed it\u2019s hard not to see it in everything Rubio says. That\u2019s unfair insofar as all of the candidates are giving canned speeches \u2014 Christie\u2019s famous townhall passage on drug addiction is one he\u2019s repeated many times \u2014 but Rubio\u2019s dependence on it under fire, when he was practically being dared to say something spontaneous, created a filter through which he\u2019ll be viewed going forward. Not fatal, I think, but it\u2019s a problem now.\n\nOne more thing. Rush praises Rubio (and Cruz) here for correctly identifying that Obama has succeeded in moving his agenda whereas so much of the rest of the party, most notably Trump, dismiss Obama\u2019s problem as incompetence and inexperience. Rush\u2019s theory for that is that the establishmentarians have to pretend that Obama screwed up because they\u2019re complicit in his successes. They\u2019ve worked with him, after all. Okay, but \u2026 so has Rubio, first and foremost on the Obama-friendly Gang of Eight bill and to a lesser extent in lending rhetorical support for the disastrous intervention in Libya. (McCarthy notes both of those in his piece.) If Rubio knew all along that Obama had bad intentions with his policies, why did he cooperate with him on anything, let alone major initiatives? And why are we knocking Trump for believing that Obama\u2019s an incompetent when the whole premise of his candidacy rests on that assumption? This goes back to what Rush said a few weeks ago about how Trump, in his own way, is making the case for smaller government by relentlessly attacking government as incompetent. Not so. Trump\u2019s problem with government is that it\u2019s run by morons, not that it\u2019s too big and therefore destined to behave inefficiently. Obama\u2019s just the head moron. Replace him with Trump and yuge improvements will be seen. If we\u2019re going to boost Trump, let\u2019s at least be clear-eyed about his message is.\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "Domo arigato.", "title": "Rush Limbaugh defends Rubio\u2019s debate answer: He\u2019s absolutely right that Obama knows what he\u2019s doing", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2016/02/08/rush-limbaugh-defends-rubios-debate-answer-hes-absolutely-right-that-obama-knows-what-hes-doing/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary", "creator": "@allahpundit"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "article": {"published_time": "2016-02-08T20:21:04+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-08T21:12:16+00:00"}, "keywords": "debate, fiction, knows what he's doing, Marco Rubio, Obama, robot, Rush Limbaugh,", "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "article_summary": "As for the substance of Rubio\u2019s answer, I wouldn\u2019t go as far in claiming that \u201cObama knows what he\u2019s doing.\u201d Domestically, that\u2019s true: ObamaCare wasn\u2019t an accident.\nIt\u2019s fine to say, as Rush and Andy McCarthy do, that Rubio was right on the merits of his \u201cObama knows what he\u2019s doing\u201d talking point.\nIt\u2019s pure amateurism, a bluff with nothing behind it, and emblematic of Obama\u2019s short-sighted approach in Syria of doing just enough so that hawks can\u2019t claim he\u2019s doing absolutely nothing while doing little enough that doves can\u2019t claim we\u2019re on our way to Vietnam 3.0.\nRubio, I\u2019m sure, does have some concrete ideas about what the commander-in-chief should be doing in Syria.\nRush\u2019s theory for that is that the establishmentarians have to pretend that Obama screwed up because they\u2019re complicit in his successes."}
