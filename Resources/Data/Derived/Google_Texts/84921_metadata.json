John Kasich speaks during an Aug. 6, 2015, debate in Cleveland. (Photo: Mandel Ngan, AFP/Getty Images)\n\nCOLUMBUS, Ohio \u2014 John Kasich likes Obamacare\u2019s expansion of Medicaid to more low-income Americans.\n\nHe wants to ensure insurance coverage for people who have pre-existing conditions. He likes insurance exchanges. And he thinks everyone should have health insurance \u2013 even young, healthy people who need an incentive to sign up.\n\nYet he says he\u2019d push to repeal President Obama\u2019s health care law and replace it with something else \u2013 something better, he says \u2013 if his presidential campaign were to prove successful.\n\nThe \u201crepeal\u201d position is essential for Kasich\u2019s GOP presidential candidacy. Indeed, many in the party are skeptical of his support for Medicaid alone. Candidates in Fox News\u2019 bottom-seven debate this month even fielded questions about why Kasich \u201cgot it wrong\u201d in expanding Medicaid in Ohio. Kasich had to defend his Medicaid move in his first question in the prime-time debate.\n\nKasich\u2019s ideas about health care illustrate the difficulty the Ohio governor may have distancing himself from a law that so many of his fellow Republicans detest.\n\nWhen asked for specifics by TheEnquirer about his plans, a common theme emerged: accomplish many of the goals of Obamacare, sometimes by similar means, but without many of the federal mandates.\n\nFirst, Kasich isn\u2019t backing off his support for expanding Medicaid.\n\nAs a governor, he\u2019s consistently said he was bringing Ohio taxpayers\u2019 money back into the state to help provide health care for Ohioans who are poor or have mental illnesses or drug addictions.\n\nKasich has insisted he wouldn\u2019t cut back on the expansion of Medicaid to more low-income Americans. Instead, he says, he\u2019d want to send the federal money back to states, with more freedoms on how to implement the program.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d like to have fewer strings,\u201d Kasich said last month.\n\nProbably the biggest change to Obamacare that Kasich has clearly endorsed: He\u2019s all but said he\u2019d scrap the controversial (and, thus, delayed) mandate that businesses with at least 50 employees provide coverage for their full-time employees.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s very, very difficult to do something like that,\u201d he told The Enquirer this summer. \u201cWhat we really need to do is make it easier for businesses to group together, to offer insurance.\u201d\n\nFrom there, it gets a little vague, except for Kasich\u2019s clear discomfort with the idea of mandating just about anything.\n\n\u201cThere is an element of personal responsibility. If you\u2019re a young person, and you get in a motorcycle accident, and you don\u2019t have insurance, we\u2019re all paying for it,\u201d Kasich told The Enquirer. But \u201cif in fact there was a mandate, I have no idea how it would be enforced. Is the government going to come around, go into everybody\u2019s office asking?\u201d\n\nKasich also thinks people should be able to shop for health insurance on an exchange, though not necessarily a federal one, promoting the free-market concept of competition.\n\nTell Kasich this sounds remarkably like Obamacare, and he demurs.\n\n\u201cLook,\u201d Kasich told The Enquirer. \u201cInsurance costs have been going up, they have disrupted a very robust market here, and I just don\u2019t think that there\u2019s any answer (in Obamacare). The biggest issue is cost, and it doesn\u2019t deal with it.\u201d\n\nIn Ohio, some insurance prices have increased. The state insurance department reports an 80% increase in the average cost of individual and small-group insurance policies from 2013 to next year\u2019s proposed prices.\n\nNationally, Obamacare generally has pushed up the costs of insurance for young, healthy people and made coverage more affordable for those who are older or sicker, said Larry Levitt, senior vice president at the Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonpartisan health-policy analysis group.\n\n\u201cIf you allow people who are sick to get insurance, someone has to pay for it,\u201d he said.\n\nKasich says a deregulated market, or individual states, should be the vehicle for establishing the facets of Obamacare that he likes, with difficult agreements brokered by a hypothetical Kasich administration, but not mandated by law.\n\nOhio Gov.

I\u2019d rather have a better system than what we have now.\u201d\n\nStill, conservatives will ask, Can you really trust Kasich to get rid of the hated Obamacare?\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to hear the phrase \u2018Obamacare-lite,\u2019 \u201d said John Pitney, a politics professor at Claremont McKenna College and former research director for the Republican National Committee.\n\nFor instance, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker used the point to hit Kasich Thursday in an interview with WMUR, a TV station in early-primary New Hampshire.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t take the Medicaid expansion under Obamacare,\u201d he said. \u201cI think that\u2019s important to a lot of Republicans \u2013 that I didn\u2019t further Obamacare.\u201d\n\nKasich\u2019s pledge to \u201crepeal and replace\u201d Obamacare is probably good enough for most Republican voters, Pitney said, even if his solution ends up resembling Obamacare in many ways. For starters, elements of Obamacare \u2013 such as the mandate to cover people with pre-existing conditions \u2013 are popular.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not going to do away with it entirely. It\u2019s already taken root,\u201d Pitney said. \u201cObamacare is a pre-existing condition.\u201d\n\nFollow @CThompsonENQ on Twitter\n\nRead or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1Nx70LY", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "COLUMBUS, Ohio\u00a0\u2014 John Kasich likes Obamacare\u2019s expansion of Medicaid to more low-income Americans.", "og": {"site_name": "USA TODAY", "description": "COLUMBUS, Ohio\u00a0\u2014 John Kasich likes Obamacare\u2019s expansion of Medicaid to more low-income Americans.", "title": "Kasich could face challenges distancing himself from Obamacare", "url": "http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/08/15/kasich-medicaid-obamacare/31775191/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/usatoday.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "COLUMBUS, Ohio\u00a0\u2014 John Kasich likes Obamacare\u2019s expansion of Medicaid to more low-income Americans.", "title": "Kasich could face challenges distancing himself from Obamacare", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/939b24310c2a4a656079983ebd8c4eb364d1b800/c=327-0-2106-1779&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/08/15/USATODAY/USATODAY/635752320049442283-AFP-543316467.jpg", "creator": "@usatoday", "site": "@usatoday", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "fb": {"app_id": 215046668549694}, "viewport": "width=1070", "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Events/John Kasich  2016 Presidential Campaign", "gci-asset-type": "story", "gci-categories": "Events/John Kasich  2016 Presidential Campaign", "title": "Kasich could face challenges distancing himself from Obamacare", "author": "Chrissie Thompson", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "news/politics/elections", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/0a22293bc9ec5fce393b9d42cc47b1d960f8adff/c=638-0-1972-1779/local/-/media/2015/08/15/USATODAY/USATODAY/635752320049442283-AFP-543316467.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/5ce6d185286f8b33d841a320c66d7e5573ec62e7/c=327-0-2106-1779/local/-/media/2015/08/15/USATODAY/USATODAY/635752320049442283-AFP-543316467.jpg", "contenttype": "story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/0f8f58f1dbccf1809a237a24d276ba31bb5274da/c=33-0-2399-1779/local/-/media/2015/08/15/USATODAY/USATODAY/635752320049442283-AFP-543316467.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/a85560dfb599f84a2260c742933ae4ca0b5eae57/c=0-0-2432-1374&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/2015/08/15/USATODAY/USATODAY/635752320049442283-AFP-543316467.jpg", "publishtime": "2015-08-15T13:02:39.250000-04:00", "shorthed": "Obamacare could pose problems for Kasich", "articleid": 31775191, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/f4ee287fd9ec0436019cd1908de25ce35fabf177/c=0-0-2432-1374/local/-/media/2015/08/15/USATODAY/USATODAY/635752320049442283-AFP-543316467.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/6b14614dadd3ce438ccddf46b02ca42751bdb19a/c=718-0-1714-1779/local/-/media/2015/08/15/USATODAY/USATODAY/635752320049442283-AFP-543316467.jpg"}}}, "article_summary": "(Photo: Mandel Ngan, AFP/Getty Images)COLUMBUS, Ohio \u2014 John Kasich likes Obamacare\u2019s expansion of Medicaid to more low-income Americans.\nJohn Kasich speaks to a packed crowd during a campaign stop in Derry, N.H., on Aug. 12, 2015.\nAnd he thinks everyone should have health insurance \u2013 even young, healthy people who need an incentive to sign up.\n\u201cInsurers and hospitals have both been doing quite well.\u201d\u201cSo what?\u201d Kasich told The Enquirer, in response to a similar statement by a reporter.\nJohn Kasich speaks during an Aug. 6, 2015, debate in Cleveland."}
