But as we extrapolate these results to see what they portend for the general election, what do we really know about the lives of the people who voted? Sad to say, in the midst of our horse race obsessions, really very little.\n\nAll totaled, the dozen Super Tuesday states are a pretty big sample group, with a total population of 85 million, almost a quarter of the U.S. population.\n\nFive of the states are more diverse than the country. Five of the states have a higher percentage of college graduates than the nation as a whole, which has 29.3 percent of adults with at least a bachelor\u2019s degree. Four have college graduation rates that are significantly lower than the U.S as a whole.\n\nAcross America 13.1 percent of those living here are foreign born but in Texas and Massachusetts that percentage is 16.5 percent and 15.3 percent, respectively. But in five states the portion of immigrants now calling the U.S. home is less that half the national percentage of foreign born.\n\nPundits this year are describing primary voters in general as being cranky, but when pressed for an explanation, the TV experts usually get quite vague about just what has voters upset \u2014 which, in a way, kind of trivializes popular sentiments. \u201cHow about those wacky, \u2018fired up\u2019 voters!\u201d\n\nIf you\u2019re lucky, what you\u2019ll get from these high-paid groupthink prognosticators will be something about how the people who are turning out to vote think the \u201cfix is in\u201d in our politics, with the super-wealthy and multinationals corrupting the process by way of billions in dark money and campaign cash.\n\nAnother commonly expressed rationale for voter discontent is disappointment over what has been the weakest and most anemic recovery since World War II. But that sugarcoats what the data shows, which is that tens of millions of Americans are idle and that several million desperately need full-time work but are being kept permanently in part-time status.\n\nIn every one of the dozen states that voted Tuesday, the ranks of those not working has grown since the start of the Obama tenure.\n\nAnd while this decline in labor force participation has deep historical roots that go back to the 1970s, this mega-trend accounts for the increasing irrelevance of the top-line unemployment number that is the gold standard of central bankers and the clueless business press.", "article_metadata": {"description": "We spend countless hours fixating on the future of the country.
