While fourth-grade students were working in small groups, one student asked a girl why she had dyed her hair. A third student, identified in the legal brief as \u201cL.L.,\u201d said the girl dyed her hair because she was the one with head lice.\n\nThe incident was reported to the Tenafly, N.J., school\u2019s bullying specialist, who \u201claunched a formal investigation and had L.L. removed from class so she could proceed to question him about the incident,\u201d according to the lawsuit. The specialist also interviewed other students and required L.L. to complete a sensitivity assignment.\n\nThe teacher then explained to the class why it was important to be nice, which embarrassed L.L. since his classmates knew his comment had spurred the additional instruction. L.L. was stigmatized as a bully, according to the brief.\n\n\u201cThe kid didn\u2019t know what was going on,\u201d said John Whitehead, founder and president of the Rutherford Institute. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t demeaning her intentionally. He knew what the facts were. He made a factual statement. Then the entire class was reminded of what the kid had done and looked at the kid like Dr. Evil.\u201d\n\nThe lawsuit alleges the state statute is too broad to allow for constitutional rights outlined in the First Amendment.\n\n\u201cOur client, all this sensitivity training\u2014he ended up worse than the girl that had the lice,\u201d Whitehead said. \u201cThey have to think about what they\u2019re doing to the kid who\u2019s [allegedly bullying].\u201d\n\nThe policy is too extreme for common sense, he said.\n\n\u201cI would put this in the category of political correctness gone crazy amuck,\u201d he said. \u201cThey don\u2019t take into account what it does to the student who is called a bully when he\u2019s not a bully. What do you do, put tape over your mouth so you don\u2019t make a mistake?\u201d\n\nWhitehead and Ken Paulson, president of the First Amendment Center, said policymakers need to remember the place and purpose of free speech when considering anti-bullying laws and policies.\n\n\u201cPublic schools have a number of obligations, in terms of students they serve,\u201d Paulson said. \u201cThey have to create a safe and secure learning environment, and that would mean shielding students from harassing behavior. But equally important is that they instill in young people an understanding of the core principles of the First Amendment and the importance of being able to share ideas freely. They\u2019re not mutually exclusive.\u201d\n\nRead more on Watchdog.org.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Education officials in New Jersey are being sued for allegedly infringing on a student\u2019s free-speech rights when he was accused of bullying another student.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Education officials in New Jersey are being sued for allegedly infringing on a student\u2019s free-speech rights when he was accused of bullying another student.", "title": "Did New Jersey School's Anti-Bullying Policy Go Too Far?", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/140731_SchoolBullying_Watchdog.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-07-31T22:12:04+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1pKodnG"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Education officials in New Jersey are being sued for allegedly infringing on a student\u2019s free-speech rights when he was accused of bullying another student.", "creator": "@dailysignal", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/140731_SchoolBullying_Watchdog.jpg"}, "title": "Did New Jersey School's Anti-Bullying Policy Go Too Far?", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Education", "tag": "k-12", "published_time": "2014-08-01T03:01:45+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-07-31T22:12:04+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "bullying, new jersey, school nurses, first amendment, sensitivity training"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe058f\"", "article_summary": "The incident was reported to the Tenafly, N.J., school\u2019s bullying specialist, who \u201claunched a formal investigation and had L.L.\nWhile fourth-grade students were working in small groups, one student asked a girl why she had dyed her hair.\nEducation officials in New Jersey are being sued for allegedly infringing on a student\u2019s free-speech rights when he was accused of bullying another student.\n\u201cThey have to think about what they\u2019re doing to the kid who\u2019s [allegedly bullying].\u201dThe policy is too extreme for common sense, he said.\nA third student, identified in the legal brief as \u201cL.L.,\u201d said the girl dyed her hair because she was the one with head lice."}
