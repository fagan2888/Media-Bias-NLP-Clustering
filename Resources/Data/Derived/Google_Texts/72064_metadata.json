Of the 34, seven of the groups are already under examination at the campus level for possible closure.\n\nThe Board of Governors will separately review the nine centers and fields that work in the marine science fields in the beginning of 2015.\n\nSeveral groups that concentrate on providing services or studying issues that affect minority or disenfranchised groups of people remain under review by the UNC Board of Governors. Those include groups like the Center for New North Carolinians at University of North Carolina-Greensboro and the Center for Civil Rights; the Sonya Haynes Stone Center for Black Culture and History and the the Center on Poverty, Work and Opportunity, all on the Chapel Hill campus.\n\nGene Nichol, the outspoken head of the poverty center, has rankled members of the UNC Board of Governors concerned about Nichol\u2019s vocal criticisms of policies under Gov. Pat McCrory and the Republican majority in the state legislature. (Note: Nichol is on the board of the N.C. Justice Center, the non-profit that house N.C. Policy Watch, but he did not have any role in the reporting or writing of this post.)\n\nJim Holmes, the UNC Board of Governor\u2019s member leading the review effort, reiterated that the review isn\u2019t aiming to weed out controversial centers.\n\n\u201cEveryone is looking at this like there\u2019s some agenda,\u201d Holmes said. \u201cI can assure you, there\u2019s not.\u201d\n\nGroups under review may be terminated, lose state funding or could continue operating as it is or be folded into an academic department, Holmes said.\n\nHolmes also said Friday that the group wants to create a new \u201cpublic advocacy\u201d policy for centers that re-state the limits and type of political or partisan activities UNC employees can engage in during work hours.\n\nThe list of 34 groups still under review by the UNC Board of Governors include:\n\nBrantley Risk and Insurance Center (Appalachian State University)\n\nCenter for Economic Research and Policy Analysis (ASU)\n\nResearch Institute for Environment, Energy, and Economics (ASU)\n\nCenter for Applied Computational Studies (East Carolina University)\n\nCenter for Diversity and Inequality Research (ECU)\n\nCenter for Health System Research and Development (ECU)\n\nCenter for Natural Hazards Mitigation Research (ECU)\n\nNC Agromedicine Institute (ECU)\n\nNC Center for Biodiversity Institute (ECU)\n\nRural Education Institute (ECU)\n\nDrug Information Center (Elizabeth City State University)\n\nInstitute for Civic Engagement and Social Change (N.C.
