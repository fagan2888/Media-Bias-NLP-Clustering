Feinstein, director of the agency\u2019s Bureau of Competition, in a statement announcing the decision.\n\n\u201cCompetition between Advocate and NorthShore results in lower prices, higher quality and greater service offerings,\u201d the F.T.C. argues in the complaint filed in the Eastern Division of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe hospital groups say they plan to fight the government\u2019s move, partly citing the effects of the federal health care law for encouraging the coordination of services and technology.\n\nThis is the third time in recent weeks that the agency has sought to scuttle a proposed hospital merger. The F.T.C. took similar action to halt the merger of two hospitals in West Virginia in November and, earlier this month, teamed up with Pennsylvania authorities to try to stop a deal between Penn State Hershey Medical Center and PinnacleHealth System.\n\nPhoto\n\nWhile the agency has traditionally been concerned about hospital mergers, the recent activity underscores just how much deal-making is going on, said Martin Gaynor, a health economist at Carnegie Mellon University and a former F.T.C. official.\n\nAbout 460 hospital mergers have taken place since 2010, he said, with little sign that the combinations are abating. \u201cIs there a Tinder app for hospital mergers?\u201d he asked.\n\nThe regulatory scrutiny of hospital mergers is occurring while other agencies are scrutinizing the proposed mergers of some of the nation\u2019s largest health insurers, including Anthem and Aetna.\n\nIn interviews, the chief executives of the Chicago hospital groups defended the merger, saying the combination fit with the federal government\u2019s overall goal of promoting alliances to help deliver better care at lower prices.\n\n\u201cAll of this is good for consumers and very pro-competitive,\u201d said James H. Skogsbergh, the chief executive of Advocate. He said that because the hospitals\u2019 market was dominated by a major insurer, the systems were \u201cprice takers, not price setters.\u201d He was referring to the state\u2019s Blue Cross Blue Shield plan.\n\nThe hospital groups say the merger would shift health care from the traditional fee-for-service model of providing high volumes of care for high payments to one focused on a streamlined system aimed at achieving lower costs.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe F.T.C.\u2019s position \u201cis one of protecting the status quo,\u201d said Mark R. Neaman, the chief executive of NorthShore.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nRegulators\u2019 main concern is former competitors\u2019 joining forces, said Mr. Gaynor, who is one of the authors of a recent study on health care pricing. He says the paper provides additional evidence that regulators need to enforce existing laws to prevent markets from having too few competitors.\n\nBut hospitals argue the merger activity is a direct result of the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cThese consolidations are absolutely mandated,\u201d said Rob Fuller, a former hospital executive and a lawyer who specializes in antitrust law at Nelson Hardiman in Los Angeles. He argues that the different government branches are sending conflicting signals to hospitals.\n\nMs. Feinstein of the F.T.C. denies there is any conflict. \u201cWe don\u2019t think the A.C.A. and the antitrust laws are in tension with each other at all,\u201d she said. Hospitals and doctors can collaborate without merging, and she noted that the agency had not challenged any of the so-called accountable care organizations, which were created to oversee the level of care required and its costs.\n\nThe F.T.C. has been successful in blocking some hospital mergers, said Matthew L. Cantor, a partner in the law firm of Constantine Cannon in New York. Those wins \u201cdemonstrate that a hospital merger that is anti-competitive cannot be defended by pointing out that the merger is consistent with the principal purposes of the Affordable Care Act,\u201d he said in an email.\n\nThe agency is seeking an injunction to block the merger, which had been planned for more than a year.\n\nHospital executives contend, however, that their proposals draw more regulatory attention than those planned by big insurance companies. \u201cInsurers seem to get a different look-see than the providers,\u201d Mr. Neaman said.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20151218201106, "twitter": {"description": "For the third time in recent weeks, the Federal Trade Commission is seeking to scuttle a proposed hospital merger.", "title": "Regulators Tamp Down on Mergers of Hospitals", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/19/business/regulators-tamp-down-on-mergers-of-hospitals.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000004102692"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/12/19/business/19jphospital1/19jphospital1-thumbLarge.jpg", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/19/business/regulators-tamp-down-on-mergers-of-hospitals.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000004102692", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/19/business/regulators-tamp-down-on-mergers-of-hospitals.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "thumbnail_width": 75, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "business", "hdl_p": "Regulators Tamp Down on Mergers of Hospitals", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/business/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "Dec. 18, 2015", "edt": "NewYork", "org": "Federal Trade Commission", "keywords": "NorthShore University HealthSystem,Advocate Health Care,Federal Trade Commission,Hospitals,Mergers  Acquisitions and Divestitures,Illinois", "news_keywords": "Hospital,Illinois", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "Reed Abelson", "thumbnail_150": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/12/19/business/19jphospital1/19jphospital1-thumbLarge.jpg", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "thumbnail_150_width": 150, "byl": "By REED ABELSON", "thumbnail_150_height": 150, "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "For the third time in recent weeks, the Federal Trade Commission is seeking to scuttle a proposed hospital merger.", "tom": "News", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/12/19/business/19jphospital1/19jphospital1-thumbStandard.jpg", "description": "For the third time in recent weeks, the Federal Trade Commission is seeking to scuttle a proposed hospital merger.", "CG": "business", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "Dec. 18, 2015", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "News", "article": {"author": "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/a/reed_abelson/index.html", "section_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/pages/business/index.html", "section": "Business Day", "modified": "2016-04-12", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/business/index.jsonp", "tag": "Illinois", "published": "2015-12-18", "section-taxonomy-id": "104D1E63-9701-497B-8CF4-A4D120C9014E"}, "thumbnail_height": 75, "geo": "Illinois", "slug": "19hospital", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20160412060004, "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/19/business/regulators-tamp-down-on-mergers-of-hospitals.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/12/19/business/19jphospital1/19jphospital1-facebookJumbo.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "For the third time in recent weeks, the Federal Trade Commission is seeking to scuttle a proposed hospital merger.", "title": "Regulators Tamp Down on Mergers of Hospitals"}, "pdate": 20151218, "des": "Mergers, Acquisitions and Divestitures", "articleid": 100000004102692, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "Regulators Tamp Down on Mergers of Hospitals", "PST": "News"}, "article_summary": "About 460 hospital mergers have taken place since 2010, he said, with little sign that the combinations are abating.\nThe regulatory scrutiny of hospital mergers is occurring while other agencies are scrutinizing the proposed mergers of some of the nation\u2019s largest health insurers, including Anthem and Aetna.\nThis is the third time in recent weeks that the agency has sought to scuttle a proposed hospital merger.\nhas been successful in blocking some hospital mergers, said Matthew L.
