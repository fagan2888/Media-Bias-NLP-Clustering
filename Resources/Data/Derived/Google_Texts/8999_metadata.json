They also estimated that 1,000 calories a day of a person\u2019s diet come from highly processed foods.\n\nBut before we gawk at that number, let\u2019s define what it means to be a processed food. According to the National Health Service (NHS), processed foods are any type of food that has been altered from its natural state for safety or convenience. Processed foods include breakfast cereals, cheese, canned vegetables, and even milk and bread \u2014 some of the staples of our daily diet. And yes, processed foods also include the unhealthier things, like microwave meals, chips, bacon, and sodas.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important for us to recognize that a processed food is not just Coca-Cola and Twinkies \u2014 it\u2019s a wide array of products,\u201d Jennifer Poti, research assistant professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and an author of the study, told Time.\n\nThe thing that almost all processed foods have in common, however, is that they\u2019re pumped with sugar and salt to help preserve their flavor and shelf life. Since most foods found in your average grocery store \u2014 aside from fresh fruit and vegetables \u2014 are technically processed, it\u2019s likely you\u2019re eating way more of these things than you're aware.\n\nIn the study, the researchers examined some 157,000 shoppers whose food purchases were tracked from 2000-2012. They used software that identified words in the nutrition and ingredient labels, then sorted the products into four different categories: minimally processed (bagged salad, frozen meat), basic processed (oil, flour, sugar), moderately processed (products still recognizable as their original plant or animal), and highly processed (food mixtures that weren\u2019t recognizable as their original source, like Twinkies).\n\nThe researchers found that American consumers mostly purchased the last two types of food. While 61 percent of purchases went to highly processed foods, 15.9 percent went to moderately processed foods; and Americans were more likely to buy ready-to-eat (68.1 percent) and ready-to-heat (15.2 percent) products.\n\nBut the researchers aren\u2019t telling people to stop eating processed foods; that can\u2019t really be avoided. Instead, be careful to read the nutrition labels and stay away from processed foods high in fat, sugar, or sodium. Products that are high in fat will generally have over 17.5g of fat per 100g; those high in sugar will have about 22.5g of sugar per 100g; and those high in salt have over 1.5g of salt per 100g (or 0.6g of sodium).\n\nSource: Poti J, Mendez M, Ng S, Popkin B.
