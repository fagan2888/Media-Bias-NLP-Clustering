Callahan participated in preseason practices Saturday.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re happy for Shane and his family that the NCAA declared him eligible to play this year,\u201d MacIntyre said in a statement of the 6-foot-6, 300-pound player. \u201cIt\u2019s great to have another state of Colorado athlete on our football team.\u201d\n\nIn Parker, Callahan played for Chaparral High School, which has enjoyed a long line of athletic tackles. The team was 7-4 his senior year, 9-3 his junior season, and 8-3 his sophomore and freshman years.\n\nCallahan received his first college offer from CU the summer before his junior year. Letters from Alabama, LSU, Notre Dame and others soon followed, and Auburn came in last to offer him a scholarship, which he eventually accepted.\n\nHe was an All-Colorado and All-State (5A) selection by The Denver Post as a senior, ranked as the state\u2019s No. 5 overall prospect in the postseason top 15. Rivals.com ranked him as the nation\u2019s No. 22 offensive tackle and the 212th-ranked player nationally.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Shane Callahan, CU Buffs transfer, eligible to compete in 2014 season", "title": "Shane Callahan, CU Buffs transfer, eligible to compete in 2014 season", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/08/04/shane-callahan-cu-buffs-transfer-eligible-to-compete-in-2014-season/", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140804__Shane-Callahanp1.jpg", "height": 411}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140804__Shane-Callahanp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-08-04T18:24:17+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T08:02:25+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca42e\"", "article_summary": "The NCAA has waived the mandatory one-year waiting period for offensive lineman Shane Callahan, who transferred to CU Boulder from Auburn University in July, meaning the sophomore will be eligible to compete during the 2014 season.\nThe timing couldn\u2019t be better: CU is in need of replacing two starting offensive lineman who completed their eligibility in 2013.\nHe was an All-Colorado and All-State (5A) selection by The Denver Post as a senior, ranked as the state\u2019s No.\nThe team was 7-4 his senior year, 9-3 his junior season, and 8-3 his sophomore and freshman years.\nThe school \u2014 which learned of the decision Monday afternoon \u2014 had requested he be eligible to compete this season based on undisclosed family reasons, a team news release said."}
