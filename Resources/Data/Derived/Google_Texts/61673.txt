The Washington Post posted a video on Monday that showed U.S. forces capturing a wanted al Qaeda suspect in Libya.

The covert operation, which shows CIA, FBI and Delta Force personnel grabbing Abdul-Hamed al-Ruqai, was caught on a closed-circuit camera.

While the capture of al-Ruqai made international news at the time, the video provides a rare glimpse of how such operations go down.

The video shows a car stopping in front of a house in Tripoli early in the morning of Oct. 5 last year.

A white van suddenly stops next to the car, and three men with guns jump out. Another van blocks the trapped car from the front. The video shows the men taking al-Ruqai, commonly known as Anas al-Libi.

Al-Libi was was charged in the U.S. with playing a role in the bombings of two American embassies in Africa in the 1990s. In October, he pleaded not guilty to terrorism charges.

After his capture, intelligence officials suggested al-Libi might provide a key to finding out more information about the 2012 Benghazi attack.

Heâ€™s currently awaiting trial in New York.
