According to the CDC, Oklahoma ranks 10th in overdoses and nationwide opioid addiction kills as many as 40 people each day.\n\nOver the last 30 years, Sunbeam Family Services Counselor David Swope said he\u2019s seen every kind of addict but recently he's been seeing a rise in the abuse of prescription drugs, specifically opioids.\n\n\u201cSometimes they get into it because they've had a surgery or an illness and they find that they like how it feels and they continue on with it so that's an innocent way they may get into it,\u201d he said.\n\nBut for thousands of Oklahomans, an innocent prescription can turn dangerous and even deadly. According to the CDC, Oklahoma ranks 10th in overdoses and nationwide opioid addiction kills as many as 40 people each day.\n\n\u201cThey can be a highly addictive drug for all people. The problem is no one really knows if they're in that addiction risk pool,\u201d said Swope.\n\nBut new guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention mean big changes for doctors. Once the top choice for pain relief, the CDC is now telling doctors medications like oxycodone, Percocet or morphine should only be used when absolutely necessary, saying patients should opt for things like ice Tylenol or ibuprofen first.\n\nBut not everyone is so sure these new guidelines will work. Pain specialists like Dr. Stephen Wilson with the Oklahoma Pain Society said the rules will only get in the way of treating patients.\n\n\u201cIt could be a nightmare,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cIt's what happens when you let the government get too involved and it's overly stringent and it's not really practical in clinical terms for most pain physicians,\u201d said Dr. Wilson.\n\nBut for Swope the new rules mean saving lives.\n\n\u201cIt's very important to see this as an epidemic, not to deny it and to recognize it,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"wn-build": "XSLT-7.1-17", "Description": "Over the last 30 years, Sunbeam Family Services Counselor David Swope said he\u2019s seen every kind of addict but recently he's been seeing a rise in the abuse of prescription drugs, specifically opioi...", "author": "Grant Hermes", "og": {"url": "http://www.news9.com/story/31488586/new-cdc-rules-affect-oklahoma-doctors-patients", "image": "http://KWTV.images.worldnow.com/images/10115464_G.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Over the last 30 years, Sunbeam Family Services Counselor David Swope said he\u2019s seen every kind of addict but recently he's been seeing a rise in the abuse of prescription drugs, specifically opioi...", "title": "New CDC Rules Affect Oklahoma Doctors, Patients"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://KWTV.images.worldnow.com/images/10115464_G.jpg", "description": "Over the last 30 years, Sunbeam Family Services Counselor David Swope said he\u2019s seen every kind of addict but recently he's been seeing a rise in the abuse of prescription drugs, specifically opioi...", "card": "summary", "title": "New CDC Rules Affect Oklahoma Doctors, Patients"}, "wnreadableurl": "new-cdc-rules-affect-oklahoma-doctors-patients", "ROBOTS": "index,follow,noarchive", "owner": "KWTV", "fb": {"app_id": 538140636230283}, "date": "2016/03/16", "KEYWORDS": "Prescription Drugs, addiction, addict, drugs, abuse, okc, news 9, kwtv", "wn-version": "ContainerE-Story", "wn-base": "IIS05", "verify-v1": "d5ZN+GNiazjgWlnr3WHikwraMvFljdUSLMgex4CGnc8=", "news_keywords": "Prescription Drugs, addiction, addict, drugs, abuse, okc, news 9, kwtv"}, "article_summary": "According to the CDC, Oklahoma ranks 10th in overdoses and nationwide opioid addiction kills as many as 40 people each day.\nPain specialists like Dr. Stephen Wilson with the Oklahoma Pain Society said the rules will only get in the way of treating patients.\n\u201cIt's very important to see this as an epidemic, not to deny it and to recognize it,\u201d he said.\nThe problem is no one really knows if they're in that addiction risk pool,\u201d said Swope.\nBut for Swope the new rules mean saving lives."}
