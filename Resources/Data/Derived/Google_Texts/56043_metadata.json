Some of the profiles may have been edited for space, to fit within a standard word count for all candidates. Any candidates not included did not return the questionnaire by press time.\n\nName: Peter J. Williams\n\nParty: Democrat\n\nAge: 57\n\nResidence: Lettsworth, Louisiana\n\nEducation: Kaplan High School, Kaplan, La. (1975); University of Southwestern Louisiana, (1980); now at University of Louisiana-Lafayette\n\nProfession: Agriculture and forestry tree producer, community advocate and consultant.\n\nFamily: Wife of 33 years, Alfreda Rodney Williams, and four adult children, Cornelius, Nathanael, Alanna, and Jasper\n\nWhat makes you the most qualified candidate in the 6th district?\n\nMy overall background in working with diverse groups and governmental agencies, in agriculture, health, housing, education, and other federal and state programs have given me the experience necessary to lead the 6th District in these troubling times across America and our state.\n\nWhat are the top two issues you want to take on as a congressional representative?\n\nFirst thing would be to re-establish the overall value of Louisiana to the nation and the world. By doing so, we can regain respect and economic worthiness, which in turn will allow us to be part of the planning process with decisions that affect our daily lives.\n\nSecond, I would attempt to introduce a formula through legislation that will prevent any future governor from refusing federal program dollars. This will safeguard the loss of much needed funds that support designated community health care, education, infrastructure, and other social safety net programs.\n\nGiven the gridlock in Washington, what would you do to actually get things done?\n\nI am a candidate for the people, not the party, although I'm a Democrat. Party politics is why there is gridlock in Washington. To get things done, I will seek to be recognized as the congressman with ears to hear, a mind that's open, and a heart fixed to make the best possible decision for all citizens of the 6th District and Louisiana.\n\nWould you support Medicaid expansion in Louisiana? Why or why not?\n\nI support Medicaid expansion in Louisiana. It provides a bridge that closes the medical gap for families that need just a little extra help obtaining quality health care, that will improve their overall quality of life. Additionally, it would help hospitals and doctors cover the cost of treating uninsured patients, which has been a financial burden to them in the past.\n\nWould you vote to repeal the Affordable Care Act? Why or why not?\n\nAs for the political clubs advocating to repeal the Affordable Care Act, they are just blowing smoke to get votes from confused and uninformed voters. The ACA is law now, and would take a serious combined act of Congress to change it. Lastly, many presidents in the past have signed flawed bills and legislation. Americans simply accepted and adjusted. I suggest with the ACA we do the same, get over it and move on.\n\nHow do you think the U.S. government should handle its borders, particularly with regard to the unaccompanied children who are now being housed in Louisiana and other states?\n\nI think the U.S. government should concentrate on increase fencing and border patrol. On the ground, we need to enforce a 30-day pick-up and return home policy, build safe facilities along the border to identify immigrants, conduct health screening and send them back where they came from. Lastly, no civilian family should be able to house unaccompanied children, nor be compensated for doing so.\n\nClick here for links to candidate profiles for those who completed questionnaires.", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "6th congressional district, br-homepage, br-news, homepage, news, state congressional races", "title": "Peter Williams, 6th Congressional District candidate: 'Re-establish the overall value of Louisiana to the nation and the world'", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Peter Williams, 6th Congressional District candidate: \\u0027Re-establish the overall value of Louisiana to the nation and the world\\u0027\", \"link\": \"http://www.nola.com/politics/index.ssf/2014/10/peter_williams_6th_congression.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://image.nola.com/home/nola-media/width620/img/politics/photo/16077747-standard.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"14187905\", \"pub_date\": \"2014-10-14T15:59:59Z\", \"author\": \"Diana Samuels, NOLA.com | The Times-Picayune\", \"tags\": [\"6th congressional district\",\"br-homepage\",\"br-news\",\"homepage\",\"news\",\"state congressional races\"] }", "twitter": {"image": "http://image.nola.com/home/nola-media/width620/img/politics/photo/16077747-standard.jpg", "creator": "@dzsamuels", "description": "'First thing would be to re-establish the overall value of Louisiana to the nation and the world'", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@nolanews"}, "article_date_updated": "Thursday, October 16, 2014,  5:20 PM", "parsely-metadata": "{\"short_title\": \"\", \"image_url\": \"http://media.nola.com/politics/photo/peter-williams-6th-congressionaljpg-e578263a1ed6cecb.jpg\", \"author_name\": \"dsamuels\", \"author_nickname\": \"Diana Samuels, NOLA.com | The Times-Picayune\", \"author_id\": \"10542793\", \"source_blog_name\": \"Louisiana Politics & Government\", \"source_blog_url\": \"http://www.nola.com/politics/index.ssf/\", \"sponsored_content\": \"0\" }", "og": {"site_name": "NOLA.com", "description": "'First thing would be to re-establish the overall value of Louisiana to the nation and the world'", "title": "Peter Williams, 6th Congressional District candidate: 'Re-establish the overall value of Louisiana to the nation and the world'", "url": "http://www.nola.com/politics/index.ssf/2014/10/peter_williams_6th_congression.html", "image": "http://image.nola.com/home/nola-media/width620/img/politics/photo/16077747-standard.jpg", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "NOLA.com", "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Tuesday, October 14, 2014, 10:58 AM", "article_author": "Diana Samuels, NOLA.com | The Times-Picayune", "Description": "'First thing would be to re-establish the overall value of Louisiana to the nation and the world'"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcde4f\"", "article_summary": "First thing would be to re-establish the overall value of Louisiana to the nation and the world.\nFamily: Wife of 33 years, Alfreda Rodney Williams, and four adult children, Cornelius, Nathanael, Alanna, and JasperWhat makes you the most qualified candidate in the 6th district?\nThis will safeguard the loss of much needed funds that support designated community health care, education, infrastructure, and other social safety net programs.\n(1975); University of Southwestern Louisiana, (1980); now at University of Louisiana-LafayetteProfession: Agriculture and forestry tree producer, community advocate and consultant.\nIt provides a bridge that closes the medical gap for families that need just a little extra help obtaining quality health care, that will improve their overall quality of life."}
