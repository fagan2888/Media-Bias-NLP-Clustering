The draft letter notes that in 2014, the MSP Program offered more than 150 plan options in 30 states and the District of Columbia and covered approximately 371,000 individuals. For 2015 the MSP Program offers more than 200 plans in 35 states.\n\nThe draft letter is brief, and refers interested parties to the proposed rule issued by OPM for the MSP in November of 2014 for greater program detail. The letter specifically notes two program requirements imposed by the ACA: MSP Program plans must use the MSP Program external review process; and MSP Program insurers must offer at least one gold and one silver plan that do not cover abortions, except \u201cwhere a pregnancy is the result of rape or incest, or for a pregnancy which, as certified by a physician, places the woman in danger of death unless an abortion is performed.\u201d This is the standard for abortions that can be funded with federal funds at this time. Whether or not a particular MSP Program plan covers abortion must be disclosed in the plan Statement of Benefits and in all MSP documents.\n\nOn January 21, 2015, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid released their enrollment snapshot for week nine of the 2015 open enrollment period, covering January 10 to 16. During that week, over 400,000 individuals selected plans through the federally facilitated marketplace, bringing total plan selections through the FFM to 7,156,691. Charles Gaba now estimates total enrollment in the marketplaces at 9.75 million with a month of open enrollment to go.\n\nUpdate on ACA-related tax issues, January 22. The Internal Revenue Service has recently issued two releases relating to the implementation of the Affordable Care Act. First, Revenue Procedure 2015-15 establishes the monthly national average premium for a bronze plan offered through the exchanges for 2015 at $207 for an individual, $1035 for a family of five or more. This figure determines the maximum shared responsibility payment that will be owed by an individual or family \u2014 for failing to obtain minimum essential coverage or qualify for an exemption for a month in 2015 \u2014 if the individual or family is required to pay a penalty based on the 2-percent-of-income-above-the-filing-limit method.\n\nThe basic flat-dollar individual responsibility penalty for 2015 is $325 per adult, half that per child up to a maximum of $975 per family. However, higher-income individuals or families must pay 2 percent of their household income above the filing limit if that amount exceeds the flat dollar amount. The 2015 amount is marginally higher than the maximum penalty for 2014 or $204 per month per individual or $1020 for families of five or more. The maximum annual payment for 2015 will be $2484 for an individual or $12,420 for families of five or more.\n\nThe IRS has also released Notice 2015-8; this provides access to the small employer tax credit for small employers in the 84 of Iowa\u2019s 99 counties in which no qualified health plans are available through the SHOP exchange in 2015. Otherwise eligible small employers in these counties can access the tax credit for 2015 by purchasing coverage that would have qualified for the tax credit prior to 2014, when it first became obligatory that coverage be purchased through a SHOP exchange. Small employers may, however, claim the tax credit for this coverage at the rate that became effective in 2014: 50 percent of the employer\u2019s contribution (35 percent for nonprofits). This relief is the same as that granted last year to small employers in certain counties in Washington and Wisconsin where SHOP exchange coverage was not available\n\nUpdate, January 16: On January 16, 2015, CMS announced the availability of three important resources that will help individuals comply with their ACA tax filing obligations. First, CMS is making available an online calculator that individuals can use to determine the lowest-cost bronze plan that was available to them in 2014. An individual who claims an affordability exemption from the individual responsibility requirement has to establish that he or she could not have afforded a bronze plan for 8 percent or less of modified adjusted gross income. The calculator will provide a determination of how much that plan would have cost. A tax filer can \u2014 by entering his or her zip code, the age of all family members, and information on months of employer coverage for any family member \u2014 receive a cost figure for the lowest cost bronze plan.\n\nA second calculator provides the cost of the second-lowest-cost silver plan available to an individual. This cost will be needed for premium tax credit reconciliation if information on a 1095-A that a tax filer receives from a marketplace is incorrect because a tax filer who received a tax credit had an unreported change in his or her household (such as a baby born or a family member getting job-based coverage). It will also be needed if a qualified health plan enrollee did not apply for or accept advance premium tax credits during 2014 but wants to claim a credit at tax filing time. Finally, the cost of the second-lowest cost silver plan will be required by someone claiming an exemption from the individual responsibility requirement on the grounds that Marketplace coverage was unaffordable, as the cost figure is necessary to determine what premium tax credit would have been provided through the marketplace had the individual applied.\n\nFor this calculator the applicant will need zip code, age of each family member, and months during which a family member was covered or eligible for coverage outside the marketplace. Brian Haile and I in an earlier post had urged that CMS provide these calculators, and we are pleased that they have done so.\n\nIn another tax-related matter, the IRS announced that free-file is now available for 2014. Free-file makes free tax filing software from 14 tax software companies available to the 70 percent of Americans who earn $60,000 or less a year and makes free forms available to higher income filers. For 2014, free-file has been designed to assist taxpayers in complying with the new ACA tax filing requirements. ACA tax filing information is also available from the IRS. CMS has also released a tax filing fact sheet.\n\nFinally, on January 16, 2015, CMS released the final 2016 actuarial value calculator and AV methodology. This information will be needed for calculating the metal level of 2016 health plans.\n\nOriginal post: In the next few days, consumers who enrolled in qualified health plans through the marketplaces in 2014 will begin receiving IRS form 1095-As from the marketplaces, be they the federally facilitated marketplaces (FFMs) or state-operated marketplaces. The form 1095-A is the form that provides individuals who have enrolled in qualified health plans through the marketplaces the information they need to fill out form 8962, which in turn is the form enrollees will need to reconcile the advance premium tax credits (APTC) they received in 2014 with the premium tax credits they were actually entitled to. The marketplace also reports the information on the 1095-A to the IRS.\n\nOn January 12, 2015, HHS released a series of frequently asked questions about the 1095-A at its REGTAP website, which are reviewed below. This post also briefly covers other ACA-related developments.\n\nThe 1095-A includes information on anyone in a household who enrolled in a qualified health plan through an exchange, including the monthly premium that they paid for coverage; any APTC the household received; and the cost of the second-lowest-cost silver, or benchmark, plan used to determine the premium tax credits. Marketplaces will mail the 1095-A to any household that enrolled in a QHP, regardless of whether household members received APTC.\n\nIf a household was covered by more than one policy, a separate 1095-A will be generated for each policy. If consumers reported a life change in the course of a year and were then granted a special enrollment period, they will receive a 1095-A for the period before reporting the life change and another for the period after. A consumer will also receive more than one 1095-A if there are more than 5 members in the household, as the form only has lines to list five household members.\n\nNo 1095-A will be provided to households that only enrolled in catastrophic coverage or stand-alone dental plans. Neither will 1095-As be available to people who were enrolled outside the exchange or in Medicaid or CHIP.\n\nThe forms should be mailed by February 2, 2015, and will also be uploaded onto consumer\u2019s online Healthcare.gov accounts. They will be printed only in English, but will contain tag lines in 15 languages with a number to call for information in other languages. A Spanish-language cover letter will be sent with the form to those who have indicated that their preferred language is Spanish.\n\nConsumers can also log onto their account at Healthcare.gov and find the 1095-A either in the \u201cTax Form\u201d section or in the \u201cMessage\u201d section. Consumers who do not have online accounts can create one and view the 1095-A in the \u201cTax Form\u201d section. This may be particularly important for consumers who do not receive a form in the mail because the address the exchange has for them is invalid, or their address has changed. These individuals can also call the Marketplace call center and have a corrected 1095-A mailed to their new address.\n\nIn some circumstances the information on the 1095-A is likely to be inaccurate. This will, for example, be the case if the consumer was terminated from a plan for non-payment after the 90-day grace period, but the 1095-A shows the consumer as having paid the full premium during the grace period. There will also be other instances where the consumer finds that information reported on the 1095-A is incorrect. For example, the form\u2019s listing of members of the household may be wrong. In these instances, the consumer should contact the marketplace call center. When either an insurer or consumer reports corrected information to the marketplace, the marketplace will generate a \u201ccorrected\u201d 1095-A. These forms will be mailed to consumers or posted to their marketplace accounts early in March, 2015.\n\nSupreme Court will not review ACA challenge. On January 12, 2015, the Supreme Court declined review in Association of Americans Physicians and Surgeons, Inc. v. Burwell. This case had earlier been dismissed out of hand by a conservative panel of the D.C. Circuit and was not a serious candidate for Supreme Court review. The D.C. Circuit had rejected the plaintiff\u2019s claim that the ACA\u2019s individual responsibility tax violated the takings clause, as a tax cannot result in a taking of property for which an individual must be compensated. The D.C. Circuit had also rejected as not timely raised a claim that the ACA was adopted in violation of the Constitution\u2019s Origination Clause, which requires bills for raising revenue to originate in the House of Representatives, and had rejected several administrative procedure claims as well. The Supreme Court apparently found nothing to object to in the appellate court\u2019s disposition of the case.\n\nWomen and children\u2019s coverage under the ACA. On January 9, 2015, the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation (ASPE) released an issue brief examining coverage of women and children under the ACA. The report provides information on how coverage of women and children and access to women and children\u2019s health services have been improved under the ACA.\n\nThe uninsured rate among women aged 18 to 64 fell 5.5 percentage points between October of 2013 and the second quarter of 2014, as ACA coverage became available. More than half (56 percent) of individuals who have selected a marketplace plan during the 2015 open enrollment period have been women, and 9 percent covered under these plans are children. Prior to 2014, individual plans commonly charged women more for health insurance than men, but with the ACA, gender discrimination in the individual and small group markets has been outlawed.\n\nIn 2011, 62 percent of individual plans did not include maternity coverage, which now must be covered by all individual and small group plans. In the individual market alone, 8.7 million Americans have gained maternity coverage. The average hospital bill for childbirth is $23,000. Women without insurance coverage pay three times as much out of pocket for childbirth as women who have private coverage, and ten times as much as those with public coverage. The report also lists preventive services and special programs that the ACA makes available to women and children.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://healthaffairs.org/blog/2015/01/13/implementing-health-reform-faqs-on-taxes-and-the-aca/", "site_name": "Health Affairs", "image": "http://healthaffairs.org/blog/wp-content/themes/HealthAffairs2015/images/facebook-default.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "Implementing Health Reform: FAQs On Taxes And The ACA (January 24 Update)"}, "description": "Implementing Health Reform: FAQs On Taxes And The ACA (January 24 Update) | At the intersection of health, health care, and policy.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Prior to 2014, individual plans commonly charged women more for health insurance than men, but with the ACA, gender discrimination in the individual and small group markets has been outlawed.\nIn 2011, 62 percent of individual plans did not include maternity coverage, which now must be covered by all individual and small group plans.\nA second calculator provides the cost of the second-lowest-cost silver plan available to an individual.\nWhen either an insurer or consumer reports corrected information to the marketplace, the marketplace will generate a \u201ccorrected\u201d 1095-A.\nThe report also lists preventive services and special programs that the ACA makes available to women and children."}
