I did a doubletake when I walked into the El Paso County Clerk and Recorder’s Office today and met spokesman Ryan Parsell for the first time.

The guy looks like Curtis Hubbard, my first boss at The Denver Post, who made it over the wall and now is working for a political consulting firm.

When I mentioned that, one bystander who knew Hubbard said the two could be twin brothers. (No, just brothers, who are both 6-foot-3 and have the same build.)

Parsell said before he grew the beard people thought he looked like Ryan Call, chairman of the Colorado Republican Party.

The clerk and recorder’s office is handling the recall election of Senate President John Morse, a Colorado Springs Democrat.
