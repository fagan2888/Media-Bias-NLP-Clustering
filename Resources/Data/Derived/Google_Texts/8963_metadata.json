Manning\u2019s contract stipulates that his $19 million salary for the 2015 season becomes fully guaranteed if he is still on the Broncos\u2019 roster by the final day of the 2014 league year.\n\nThe new 2015 season begins on March 10, so Manning would have to notify the Broncos of his intentions by March 9. The Broncos signed Manning to a five-year, $96 million contract in March of 2012. He drew salaries of $18 million in 2012; $20 million in 2013, when he broke all the league\u2019s significant single-season passing records; and $20 million this past season.\n\nWATCH: Mike Klis talks about John Elway\u2019s view of Gary Kubiak\n\nThe final two years of his contract are to pay him $19 million in 2015 and $19 million in 2016. As they say, Manning has 19 million reasons to make up his mind by March 9 to keep playing.\n\nMike Klis: mklis@denverpost.com or twitter.com/mikeklis", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Peyton Manning has March 9 deadline to make career decision", "title": "Peyton Manning has March 9 deadline to make career decision", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/01/19/peyton-manning-has-march-9-deadline-to-make-career-decision/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150119__SP15FBNBRONCOS7880xp1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150119__SP15FBNBRONCOS7880xp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2015-01-19T17:53:11+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T05:39:34+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "WATCH: Mike Klis talks about Alex Gibbs\u2019 connection to the BroncosThere is a hard deadline, though.\nAs they say, Manning has 19 million reasons to make up his mind by March 9 to keep playing.\nThe Broncos signed Manning to a five-year, $96 million contract in March of 2012.\nThe new 2015 season begins on March 10, so Manning would have to notify the Broncos of his intentions by March 9.\nMike Klis: mklis@denverpost.com or twitter.com/mikeklis"}
