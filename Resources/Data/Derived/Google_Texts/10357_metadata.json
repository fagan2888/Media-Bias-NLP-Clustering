There, he drew attention to the already forgotten government shutdown: \u201cthere\u2019s no question that the shutdown harmed our jobs market. The unemployment rate still ticked up. And we don\u2019t yet know all the data for this final quarter of the year, but it could be down because of what happened in Washington.\u201d\n\nYes, 850,000 furloughed federal employees may have tipped the scales, but really they all got a free 16-day vacation. They were, ultimately, all paid.\n\nObama wants to blame the 16-day federal employee paid vacation on the Republicans\u2014and there may well be fault there. But what about the thousands of jobs that have been lost due to the polices of his administration\u2014people in the private sector who have been out of work for more than 16 months?\n\nBecause of what happens in Washington, thousands\u2014if not millions\u2014of private-sector employees have, effectively, been permanently furloughed and/or new jobs are not created as a result of the Obama Administration\u2019s war on energy.\n\nA quick search using the phrase \u201cjobs lost due to coal-fired power plant closures\u201d produces a plethora of stories with hundreds of job losses. Nearly 300 coal-fired power plants are being shutdown across the U.S. due to EPA regulations\u2014which according to the American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity (ACCCE) is \u201cfive times greater than the EPA predicted would be forced to shut down due to its regulations.\u201d Mike Duncan, President and CEO of ACCCE, says: \u201cThe EPA continues to downplay the damage its regulations are causing to the U.S. economy and to the many states that depend on coal for jobs and affordable electricity.\u201d\n\nIn Massachusetts, the closure of Brayton Point Power Station\u2014which is the second shutdown in the region, will cost 240 jobs.\n\nA Fox News story about the closure of coal-fired plants in Georgia that will result in the loss of 480 jobs, states: \u201cseveral utilities have made similar announcements, saying they opted to close aging coal plants rather than pay hundreds of millions of dollars to install pollution-control equipment to comply with federal clean-air rules.\u201d\n\nIn Pennsylvania, the closure of two plants has resulted in the loss of 380 jobs. Melody Longstreth, executive director of the Waynesburg Area Chamber of Commerce, blames the EPA for the jobs losses: \u201cUnfortunately, regulation affects everybody, whether you\u2019re a mom-and-pop business all the way up to that.\u201d Her colleague, Muriel Nuttall, executive director of the Fayette County Chamber of Commerce, adds: \u201cIn addition to job losses at the plant, the closing will have a \u2018domino effect\u2019 on related jobs, such as truck drivers and barge operators.\u201d\n\nCongressman Tim Murphy (R-PA), who represents the district where the Pennsylvania plants are located, laments: \u201cThe front line in the administration\u2019s war on coal is right here in Southwestern Pennsylvania, and the casualties are the factories and homeowners, who will pay higher electric bills, as well as the hundreds of utility workers, boilermakers, and miners who will be out of work. With the shutdown of the Mitchell plant and Hatfield\u2019s Ferry, which just four short years ago underwent $1 billion in upgrades, the president is making good on his promise to \u2018bankrupt\u2019 anyone who operates a coal plant.\u201d\n\nThese closures result in jobs lost at the power stations and the surrounding communities, but they\u2014along with additional EPA regulations\u2014also cause the loss of jobs at the coal mines.\n\nAddressing the Mitchell and Hatfield\u2019s Ferry plants, Phil Smith, a spokesperson for the United Mine Workers of America, said: \u201cIt\u2019s clearly going to have bad implications for coal miners.\u201d\n\nAccording to a report in the Herald-Standard, about a quarter of the coal-fired plants that have been closed or are scheduled for shutdown, buys, or has bought, coal from Alpha Natural Resources. Company spokesperson Samatha Davison states: \u201cBy all indications, regulators in Washington are intent on limiting the production and use of coal, the most abundant domestic energy source we have in America. With that said, this is another example of how the EPA regulations are impacting the electricity-generation business and the coal industry.\u201d\n\nMuch of the coal comes from Kentucky. Bill Bissett, President of the Kentucky Coal Association, told me about the loss of thousands of jobs as a result of EPA regulations: \u201cEastern Kentucky has lost more than 6,000 direct coal-mining jobs. For every one direct mining job lost, three other Kentuckians lose their livelihoods with the loss of indirect jobs. Beyond this loss of direct and indirect employment, you also have the loss of what is called induced jobs, which are unrelated directly to the mining of coal, but negatively impact automobile dealerships, restaurants and anywhere these former direct and indirect employees spent their paychecks.\u201d\n\nThe regulations coming from the Obama Administration are not just hurting mining jobs through the expensive and excessive rules on power plants, but through retroactively blocking new mining projects such as the Mingo Logan mine in West Virginia. The decision on the part of the EPA to withdraw specific parts of a permit after it was issued is unprecedented in the history of the Clean Water Act. The Mingo Logan permit was issued in January 2007, by the Army Corps of Engineers and authorized discharge from the Spruce No. 1 coal mine into nearby streams. Nearly three years later, the EPA published a final determination on the permit that withdrew those disposal sites.\n\nThe EPA\u2019s decision is an example of bureaucracy at its worst and has sparked bipartisan criticism from West Virginia\u2019s Congressional representatives. Senator Joe Manchin, a Democrat states: \u201cOne agency grants a permit, another agency takes it away and business suffers in the end. The federal government should be an ally, not an adversary, in helping to strike a balance between protecting the environment and creating good American jobs.\u201d Likewise, Republican Representative Shelley Moore Capito said: \u201cThe Environmental Protection Agency has continued to overstep its bounds in its efforts to implement the president\u2019s anti-energy policies. Not only will this ruling cost West Virginians hundreds of jobs, but it begs the question: Who is safe?\u201d\n\nThe Mingo Logan case will continue to be played out in the courts. Meanwhile, Senators Manchin and David Vitter (R-LA)\u2014who is also the top Republican on the Environment and Public Works Committee, have issued a letter to the EPA regarding its \u201cextreme approach.\u201d They are demanding information from EPA about the revocation of Mingo Logan\u2019s previously approved federal permit. In the letter, the Senators point to the company\u2019s \u201cfaithful compliance with the permit\u2019s terms\u201d\u2014yet, the EPA\u2019s unprecedented actions unilaterally revoked the permit.\n\nThe Obama Administration\u2019s control of permits is also impacting the oil-and-gas industry,which even in its fettered state is largely responsible for the private sector job growth. A recent EIA report states that from the start of 2007 through the end of 2012, total U.S. private sector employment increased by about 1%. \u201cOver the same period, the oil and natural gas industry increased by more than 162,000 jobs, a 40% increase.\u201d But there could be much more.\n\nBefore the Macondo Well accident, analysts expected 45 rigs to be operating in the Gulf by 2013. In a recent investors\u2019 report, the International Strategy & Investment Group said: \u201cAfter essentially being left for dead following the devastating Macondo blowout, we believe the deepwater Gulf of Mexico is in the early stages of an extended growth cycle.\u201d Only 38% of deepwater reserves are currently producing oil, while an additional 60% are in appraisal, development or discovery status. Today there are 40 rigs currently under contract in the Gulf.\n\nWhile drilling permits are being issued in the gulf, it is, according to Senator Vitter at \u201can anemic pace.\u201d The National Ocean Industries Association (NOIA) confirmed that it now takes on average 108 days to get an offshore drilling permit, twice as long as the average 54 days it took pre-Macondo.\n\nEarlier this year, the House of Representatives passed the Offshore Energy and Jobs Act (H.R. 2231), which directs the Secretary of the Interior to \u201cimplement a leasing program that includes at least 50% of the available unleased acreage within each outer Continental Shelf (OCS) planning area\u2026\u201d\n\nRegarding H.R. 2231, Randall Luthi, President of NOIA, issued a statement that includes: \u201cOpening up more of our OCS to energy exploration makes good sense and even better cents, adding thousands of domestic jobs and potentially billions of dollars in state and Federal revenues.\u201d\n\nA report released last month from the Consumer Energy Alliance found that more than 10,000 new jobs could be created if exploration and production were to take place in just the mid-Atlantic region of the OCS. A thorough economic analysis by the American Energy Alliance found that the potential resources in the OCS alone could sustain 1.2 million new, full-time jobs per year over the next 30 years if the OCS is authorized and permits are granted.\n\n[Originally published on TownHall.com]", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://blog.heartland.org/2013/11/put-the-permanently-furloughed-private-sector-employees-back-to-work/", "type": "activity", "image": "http://blog.heartland.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/post-unemployment.jpg", "site_name": "Somewhat Reasonable", "title": "Put the Permanently Furloughed Private-sector Employees Back To Work"}, "robots": "noodp,noydir", "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8479\"", "article_summary": "Because of what happens in Washington, thousands\u2014if not millions\u2014of private-sector employees have, effectively, been permanently furloughed and/or new jobs are not created as a result of the Obama Administration\u2019s war on energy.\nThere, he drew attention to the already forgotten government shutdown: \u201cthere\u2019s no question that the shutdown harmed our jobs market.\nWith that said, this is another example of how the EPA regulations are impacting the electricity-generation business and the coal industry.\u201dMuch of the coal comes from Kentucky.\nObama wants to blame the 16-day federal employee paid vacation on the Republicans\u2014and there may well be fault there.\nFor every one direct mining job lost, three other Kentuckians lose their livelihoods with the loss of indirect jobs."}
