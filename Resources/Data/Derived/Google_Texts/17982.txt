Fox Business Network anchor Melissa Francis said she was “silenced” by CNBC when management told her she was “disrespecting the office of the president” by reporting about Obamacare.

Francis highlighted Obamacare architect Jonathan Gruber’s comments about the “stupidity” of American voters and the administration intentionally misleading the public about what’s in the law and said in her experience, some of the media helped to hide the truth about the law.

“It’s shocking, but it doesn’t surprise me because when I was at CNBC, I pointed out to my viewers that the math of Obamacare simply didn’t work,” Francis said Friday. “Not the politics by the way, but just the basic math. And when I did that, I was silenced.”

Francis pointed out that she has an economics degree from Harvard University and said she was simply trying to explain the math behind Obamacare to her viewers — the same math Gruber has candidly admitted the administration tried to hide.

“I said on the air that you couldn’t add millions of people to the system and force insurance companies to cover their pre-existing conditions without raising the price on everyone else,” Francis said. “I pointed out that it couldn’t possibly be true that if you like your plan, you can keep it. That was a lie. And in facts, millions of people had their plans canceled.”

Francis said she was called into a meeting with CNBC management (she would not specify names) and told she was “disrespecting the office of the president.”
