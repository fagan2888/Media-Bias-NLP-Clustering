His latest challenge: mastering zone-blocking.\n\n\u201cI love zone scheme,\u201d he said at the Broncos\u2019 Dove Valley facility Wednesday. \u201cIt\u2019s more lateral moving, being smart and just being able to move quickly and just being able to get to the cut block on the back side.\u201d\n\nWATCH: Darian Stewart has starting mindset\n\nGarland, a former practice-squad player who played eight games last season for the Broncos, has spent the past couple months studying the team\u2019s new schemes, learning new calls and poring over past offenses. And his experience on the defensive line has come in handy.\n\n\u201cIt helps to be from the other side,\u201d Garland said. \u201cYou can kind of understand the way they\u2019re thinking, and it helps you defend against it.\u201d\n\nStewart, who signed a two-year deal with the Broncos in March as a replacement for safety Rahim Moore, said he was drawn to Denver because of coach Gary Kubiak, his offensive coordinator in Baltimore in 2014.\n\nAnd in just a month\u2019s time, Stewart is impressed by the Broncos\u2019 defense and coordinator Wade Phillips\u2019 3-4 scheme.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s straightforward,\u201d Stewart said. \u201cWade has a good scheme set up for us, and we have a hell of a defense. We\u2019re well-rounded at every position. We got depth, and I think this year is going to be a great year for us.\u201d\n\nStewart faces some competition for the starting job at safety, as David Bruton has made his desire to start known, and Phillips has talked about possibly using cornerback Bradley Roby at safety.\n\nTo Stewart, the more, the better.\n\n\u201cCompetition is needed,\u201d he said. \u201d It makes all of us better. I\u2019m up for the challenge.\u201d\n\nNicki Jhabvala: njhabvala@denverpost.com or twitter.com/nickijhabvala", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Ben Garland, Darian Stewart confident in Broncos\u2019 new schemes, depth", "title": "Ben Garland, Darian Stewart confident in Broncos\u2019 new schemes, depth", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/05/20/ben-garland-darian-stewart-confident-in-broncos-new-schemes-depth/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150520_011226_ben-garland.jpg", "height": 426}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150520_011226_ben-garland.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-05-20T13:08:40+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-24T06:25:42+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb002\"", "article_summary": "With a new coaching staff and new schemes, the 2015 Broncos are adjusting, something offensive lineman Ben Garland and safety Darian Stewart know all too well.\nGarland, who switched from the defensive to offensive line in 2013 and is vying for the starting job at guard, said he has \u201ctotally embraced\u201d his role on the offensive line.\nAnd in just a month\u2019s time, Stewart is impressed by the Broncos\u2019 defense and coordinator Wade Phillips\u2019 3-4 scheme.\n\u201cI love zone scheme,\u201d he said at the Broncos\u2019 Dove Valley facility Wednesday.\n\u201cWade has a good scheme set up for us, and we have a hell of a defense."}
