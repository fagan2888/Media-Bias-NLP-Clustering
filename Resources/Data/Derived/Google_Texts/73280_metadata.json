Rick Scott emphasized his vision of Florida as a place overflowing with jobs and tax cuts that lure residents from other states.\n\n\"You have heard me constantly talk about jobs since 2010, when I got into the race. I promise you I\u2019m not going to stop,\" he said. \"I\u2019ll be working to make sure Florida\u2019s the place where you can get a job and you can have a great opportunity until the last day I serve as your governor.\"\n\nScott\u2019s Jan. 6 speech coincided with a major news development in Florida: the start of gay marriage -- including at the Leon County clerk\u2019s office just blocks away from the state Capitol. Scott made no mention of that topic during his speech.\n\nSince 2010, we have fact-checked Scott more than any other Florida politician: 125 times . (Republican U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio comes in a distant second with 79 fact-checks .) We\u2019ve rated 11 percent of Scott\u2019s statement True; 24 percent Mostly True; 25 percent Half True; 18 percent Mostly False; 17 percent False and 5 percent Pants on Fire.\n\nScott made some familiar claims in his speech about job growth, tax cuts and education spending. Here, we\u2019ll review how we\u2019ve previously rated similar statements.\n\nJobs and taxes\n\nScott touted his jobs creation goal from 2010:\n\n\"Four years ago \u2026 we set an ambitious goal of 700,000 jobs over seven years. Today, I\u2019m proud to announce that Florida businesses have in fact created more than 700,000 jobs in less than four years.\"\n\nBut that\u2019s not actually what Scott promised.\n\nDuring the 2010 campaign, economists said Florida would add 1 million jobs anyway as the state rebounded from the Great Recession. Scott promised the 700,000 would be in addition to that growth. But he denied saying it after being elected, despite his answer being recorded and widely reported. PolitiFact Florida, however, is holding him to that 1.7 million number because that\u2019s what he promised on the campaign trail. We have rated Scott\u2019s promise as In the Works on our Scott-O-Meter, a database of Scott\u2019s 2010 and 2014 campaign promises.\n\nScott repeated his commitment to lower taxes, saying, \"In the next four years, we are going to build on our legacy of cutting taxes more than 40 times,\" he said.\n\nScott said in May that he had \"cut taxes 40 times for Florida families.\" These tax cuts ranged from credits to exemptions to changing rates and penalties. The list is full of caveats, including that some were counted more than once, while some were only changes to scheduled increases. Also, most of the tax cuts went to businesses, not individuals. We rated that claim Half True .\n\nEducation spending\n\nScott talked about his promise to boost K-12 per-pupil spending: \"Now, we know the workers of tomorrow are in our classrooms today -- and that is why this year we\u2019ll have the highest per-pupil funding for K-12 education in the history of the state of Florida.\"\n\nIn August 2014, Scott proposed a budget for 2015 that would include $7,176 in per-pupil spending. His goal was to beat the record of his opponent at the time, Democrat Charlie Crist, who had overseen the high mark for per-pupil spending of $7,126 in 2007 before the recession hit. If we factor in inflation, Crist would still hold the record.\n\nOverall student enrollment has grown during Scott\u2019s tenure, so it\u2019s not a surprise that the total budget would grow, too. The schools\u2019 full-time-equivalent student body grew by about 68,000 between 2011-12 and 2014-15.\n\nWhen Republicans claimed last year that under Scott, there has been a \"historic $20 billion in funds for education,\" we rated that Half True .\n\nScott-O-Meter\n\nScott talked about several promises that we are tracking on our Scott-O-Meter . We will track 20 promises from his second term -- we tracked 57 in his first term. During his first campaign, Scott made several promises to appeal to conservatives on hot-button topics including drug testing welfare recipients , fighting against Obamacare and immigration amnesty. However, in his second campaign, he focused more on more broad-based issues such as education, spending and taxes.\n\nScott mentioned his promise to raise K-12 per pupil spending , eliminate the sales tax on manufacturing equipment , invest $1 billion in Florida waters and spend $25 billion on roads . If the Legislature takes action on these proposals, we\u2019ll soon be rating them on the Scott-O-Meter.\n\nSpot a claim in need of fact-checking?
