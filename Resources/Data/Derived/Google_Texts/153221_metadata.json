Tom Carper (D) campaigned for Hillary Clinton at a rally in Delaware on Monday \u2013 but she probably wished he hadn\u2019t. In his introduction of her in front of a confused crowd, Carper praised Clinton\u2019s eight years as governor.\n\n\u201cHillary Clinton was right there in the middle of it all. I saw her. I saw her as a governor, as chairman of the National Governor\u2019s Association, she was terrific,\u201d Carper said.\n\nThat\u2019s nice \u2013 except Clinton never served as a governor. She was a New York senator for eight years, before she assumed the role of President Obama\u2019s secretary of state.\n\nYet, Carper was insistent.\n\n\u201cFor eight years that we served together in the House, she did her job. She did her job. She was amazing. She was amazing,\u201d Carper said. \u201cShe always surrounded herself by the best people you could find. God, she was a terrific colleague.\u201d\n\nNope.\n\nCarper isn\u2019t the only Clinton surrogate who has hurt more than helped her cause. Shortly after New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio endorsed her, he embarrassed her with a racially charged skit that could have jeopardized her image with the African-American community. Then, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo offered an indirect jab at Clinton by reminding everyone that the Democratic candidate usually has the nomination sewn up by now.\n\nShe is happy with one of her friends, however. Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe earned Clinton\u2019s favor by giving violent criminals the right to vote.\n\nWhile she's still in Delaware, perhaps Clinton should return Carper\u2019s compliments by congratulating him on his UN ambassadorship and Nobel Peace Prize.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Well this is awkward..05/26/2016 17:52:06PM EST.", "author": "Cortney O'Brien", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Well this is awkward.", "title": "Cortney O'Brien - Oops: Delaware Senator Tries to Campaign for Hillary, Praises Her Nonexistent Governorship", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/cortneyobrien/2016/04/25/delaware-senator-tries-to-campaign-for-hillary-praises-her-nonexistent-governorship-n2153461", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/uploads/2016/4/25/12.png", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "Well this is awkward.", "title": "Cortney O'Brien - Oops: Delaware Senator Tries to Campaign for Hillary, Praises Her Nonexistent Governorship", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/cortneyobrien/2016/04/25/delaware-senator-tries-to-campaign-for-hillary-praises-her-nonexistent-governorship-n2153461", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/uploads/2016/4/25/12.png", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Oops: Delaware Senator Tries to Campaign for Hillary, Praises Her Nonexistent Governorship, Cortney O'Brien, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2627\"", "article_summary": "I saw her as a governor, as chairman of the National Governor\u2019s Association, she was terrific,\u201d Carper said.\nThen, New York Gov.\nSen.
