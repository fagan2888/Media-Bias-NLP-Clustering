This law will save lives by protecting young people from these horrible and damaging practices,\u201d said Troy Stevenson, executive director of Garden State Equality.\n\nThe National Center for Lesbian Rights, which represented Garden State Equality in the case, praised the court\u2019s \u201cclear and thorough decision\u201d that state-licensed therapists don\u2019t have a constitutional right to engage in \u201cdiscredited practices.\u201d\n\nWhen Gov. Chris Christie signed the law, he cited concerns about government intrusion on parental rights. But \u2014 due in part to his personal beliefs that people are born gay \u2014 he could not support change-therapies for youth when there was evidence that it could be harmful.\n\n\u201cI believe that exposing children to these health risks without clear evidence of benefits that outweigh these serious risks is not appropriate,\u201d Mr. Christie concluded.\n\nThe plaintiffs in the case, however, argued that their counseling services are needed because they honor clients\u2019 desires to \u201cprioritize their religious and moral values above unwanted same-sex attractions, behaviors, identities.\u201d\n\nThey also argued that their services can be and are successful: Plaintiff and licensed professional counselor Tara King \u201cis a former lesbian\u201d who received sexual-orientation change efforts \u201cand her life is living proof that SOCE counseling can and does work for some individuals,\u201d said legal briefs filed by several lawyers with Liberty Counsel.\n\nIn addition to Ms. King; psychologist Ronald Newman, founder of the Christian Counseling Consortium of South Jersey; the National Association for Research and Therapy of Homosexuality (NARTH); and the American Association of Christian Counselors (AACC) are plaintiffs in the case.\n\nLiberty Counsel lawyers could not be immediately reached for comment Friday night.\n\nHowever, these lawyers, including Demetrios Stratis and Mat Staver, have filed a second lawsuit against the New Jersey counseling law, also in Camden federal court.\n\nTheir plaintiffs this time are two unidentified parents and their 15-year-old son. The family claims that the new law is blocking the therapy that has been helping their son. They also claim the law violates their rights to free speech, freedom of religion and \u201cequal protection,\u201d since the law permits them and their son to receive only \u201cgay-affirming\u201d therapy.\n\nA federal judge is scheduled to decide by Dec. 2 whether to grant the family a temporary injunction to stop enforcement of the law.\n\nThe New Jersey law forbids state-licensed therapists, psychologists, social workers and counselors from providing sexual-orientation change efforts to a child under age 18. It does not apply to unlicensed counselors and clergy.\n\nDozens of professional organizations, including the American Psychological Association, have expressed doubt about sexual-orientation change therapies.\n\nThe first law to outlaw change therapies for minors was enacted in California. That law is currently in a court challenge before the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, with NARTH and AACC as some of the plaintiffs.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A New Jersey law banning therapies to affect the sexual orientation or gender identity of a minor has been upheld as constitutional.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/nov/9/nj-judge-upholds-law-banning-gay-conversion-therap/", "site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "type": "article", "description": "A New Jersey law banning therapies to affect the sexual orientation or gender identity of a minor has been upheld as constitutional.", "title": "N.J. judge upholds law banning \u2018gay-conversion\u2019 therapies for youth"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "description": "A New Jersey law banning therapies to affect the sexual orientation or gender identity of a minor has been upheld as constitutional.", "card": "summary", "title": "N.J. judge upholds law banning \u2018gay-conversion\u2019 therapies"}, "Author": "Cheryl Wetzstein", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Social Issues, Law Crime"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb76c\"", "article_summary": "A New Jersey law banning therapies to affect the sexual orientation or gender identity of a minor has been upheld as constitutional.\nHowever, these lawyers, including Demetrios Stratis and Mat Staver, have filed a second lawsuit against the New Jersey counseling law, also in Camden federal court.\nThe New Jersey law forbids state-licensed therapists, psychologists, social workers and counselors from providing sexual-orientation change efforts to a child under age 18.\nThe dismissal is a victory for the state, which enacted the law in August, and gay-rights groups, which pushed for the law.\nIn her Friday ruling, U.S. District Judge Freda Wolfson said the law did not violate constitutional rights of therapists because it only regulated conduct, not protected speech."}
