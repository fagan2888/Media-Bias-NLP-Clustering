Nevada’s Moonlight Bunny Ranch “working girls” are excited about Obamacare, KXTV reports.

Come January 1st, insurance companies will no longer be able to deny health insurance to Nevada’s legal prostitutes. Many of the women have had issues attaining coverage in the past, in part because of the high health risks and pre-existing conditions common in their profession.

However, it’s not all good news for owner Dennis Hof. The new Obamacare mandates will cost him approximately an extra $250,000 per year:

The Affordable Care Act, Obamacare, has been touted as a boon to America’s self-employed. That includes the independent contractors at the Moonlight Bunny Ranch, otherwise known as prostitutes.

Obamacare has been getting a lot of criticism and negative attention in recent weeks because of its dismal website. But for the women working at one of the few legal brothels in the country, Obamacare is exactly what they need.

“The working girls, it’s wonderful because finally they’re going to be able to get insurance as the independent contractors they are, and some with pre-existing conditions,” Bunny Ranch owner Dennis Hof said.

Hof said the act is actually a double-edge sword for him. Although his working girls will now have health coverage, roughly 150 non-prostitute employees at Hof’s several businesses will get government-mandated coverage at his expense, which he estimates will be about a $250,000 per year.

“Everything changes in January,” Bunny Ranch Prostitute Taylor Lee said. “I’m very excited that this opportunity is around for everyone.”

“Well, I think it’s ‘Hookers for Obama’ because they appreciate what he’s done and Obamacare works for them,” Hof said.

We’re not really sure the White House would welcome that endorsement. On the other hand, though, it does tend to deflect attention from that klunky Obamacare website.
