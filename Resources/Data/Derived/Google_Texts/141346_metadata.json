Last Sunday, an organized mob of about four dozen people attacked a Walmart in Macon, Georgia, intentionally doing damage to displays and merchandise and dragging a man out of motorized cart and throwing him to the floor. The Macon Telegraph reports:\n\nFloors in parts of the store were \u201ccoated with broken merchandise,\u201d the report added. \u201cThe length of the store from front to rear was lined with items which had been shattered, destroyed, turned over and thrown about.\u201d When sheriff\u2019s deputies got there, the crowd \u201cbegan to flee into many different vehicles and leave the scene,\u201d the report said.\n\nTo my mind, the most horrifying aspect is:\n\nSome in the crowd also snatched a man, apparently a shopper at the Zebulon Road store, from a motorized shopping cart and dragged him to the floor, Bibb County sheriff\u2019s officials said Monday.\n\nA sole culprit has been taken into custody:\n\nThe teenager seen leading the rushing horde of young men and women told a Wal-Mart employee \u201cthat this was a planned event ... to see how much damage they could cause,\u201d the sheriff\u2019s report said. The teen, identified as 17-year-old Kharron Nathan Green, of Ashton Drive in northwest Bibb County, was arrested when he returned to the store to retrieve his cellphone. Green was jailed and later released on bond after being charged with inciting a riot and second-degree damage to property.\n\nThe odd (well, actually quite common) thing about this report and all the others I could find (including ABC News and Newsmax) is that in this age of hyper-consciousness about diversity, nobody dared notice that in the videos taken from multiple cameras (see embedded videos below), all of the miscreants appear to be black. This just shows the taboos that operate in American society and journalism. The endless propaganda that holds America to be a terrible racist place that has oppressed blacks is having predictable consequences, and these consequences are being erased from the public's notice insofar as possible.\n\nThis sort of thing never ends well.\n\nVideos from the store\u2019s surveillance cameras:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.americanthinker.com/blog/2015/07/organized_mob_of_no_particular_race_according_to_media_ransacks_a_walmart_attacks_handicapped_man_in_motorized_cart.html", "image": "http://www.americanthinker.com/assets/images/at-painter-og-image.png", "title": "Blog: Organized mob (of no particular race, according to media) ransacks a Walmart, attacks handicapped man in motorized cart"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "The fragile bonds of civilization that keep society peaceful and orderly are fraying in the face of mobs organized online.\nThe Macon Telegraph reports:Floors in parts of the store were \u201ccoated with broken merchandise,\u201d the report added.\nGreen was jailed and later released on bond after being charged with inciting a riot and second-degree damage to property.\nLast Sunday, an organized mob of about four dozen people attacked a Walmart in Macon, Georgia, intentionally doing damage to displays and merchandise and dragging a man out of motorized cart and throwing him to the floor.\nVideos from the store\u2019s surveillance cameras:"}
