That\u2019s why this bipartisan legislation already passed the Senate with support from both parties. That\u2019s why labor unions support it. That\u2019s why the American people support it.Americans know that construction of this infrastructure project would pump billions into the economy and support thousands of good jobs. They also know that America could achieve this with, as the President\u2019s own State Department has indicated, minimal environmental impact. So Americans are urging President Obama not to interfere in the review process for political reasons any longer. Americans are urging the President to finally heed scientific conclusions his own State Department already reached. \u201cLet American workers build this infrastructure project, Mr. President. Sign this jobs and infrastructure bill. Powerful special interests may be demanding that the President veto Keystone Jobs, but we hope he won\u2019t. If the President does ultimately bow to these special-interest demands, that\u2019s a discussion we can have then. But either way, Americans should know this: the new Congress won\u2019t stop pursuing good ideas. This new majority is committed to refocusing Washington on the concerns of the middle class. And the passage of bipartisan bills like Clay Hunt and Keystone Jobs shows we\u2019re doing just that.\n\nMcConnell promised to repeal Obamacare, combat the president\u2019s policies, and to break Obama. So far, he is 0 for 3. Obamacare repeal is DOA. McConnell\u2019s efforts to engage in combat with the President have resulted in defeat after defeat, and the man who promised to make the president do the GOP\u2019s bidding is now \u201choping\u201d that that Obama will reconsider his planned veto of Keystone XL.\n\nObama will veto the bill because Republicans are trying to hijack the process. The President and many others have pointed out that this bill is neither a jobs nor an infrastructure bill.\n\nMcConnell\u2019s attempt to sell his few jobs creating gift to the Koch brothers and Big Oil as a jobs bill would be funny if it weren\u2019t so sad.\n\nMcConnell was forced to announce yesterday that the Senate can\u2019t pass the House\u2019s Homeland Security funding bill that also overturned President Obama\u2019s executive actions on immigration. President Obama is having his way with the Republican congressional leadership, as Mitch McConnell has found out that the imaginary Obama that he promised to take down bears no resemblance to the man who is currently residing at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell campaigned on forcing the president to bend to the will of Republicans, but it is the Kentucky senator who is now on bended knee asking Obama to reconsider his promise to veto the Keystone XL bill.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "author": "Jason Easley", "og": {"site_name": "Politicus USA", "description": "Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell campaigned on forcing the president to bend to the will of Republicans, but it is the Kentucky senator who is now on bended knee asking Obama to reconsider his promise to veto the Keystone XL bill.", "title": "Mitch McConnell Begs President Obama To Reconsider His Planned Keystone XL Veto", "url": "http://www.politicususa.com/2015/02/11/mitch-mcconnell-begs-president-obama-reconsider-planned-keystone-xl-veto.html", "image": "http://15130-presscdn-0-89.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/obama-mcconnell-1.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-02-11T11:17:42+00:00", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 523732690, "app_id": 113462415332922, "pages": 186473214703370}, "keywords": "Editors' Picks,Featured News,Issues,keystone xl,mitch mcconnell,obama to veto keystone XL bill,President Obama,politicususa,liberal,politics,sarah jones,jason easley,barack obama,hillary clinton,bernie sanders,msnbc,media", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/PoliticusUSA", "section": "Issues", "published_time": "2015-02-11T11:15:46+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-02-11T11:17:42+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "keystone xl, mitch mcconnell, obama to veto keystone XL bill, President Obama"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd99ff\"", "article_summary": "Powerful special interests may be demanding that the President veto Keystone Jobs, but we hope he won\u2019t.\nSo Americans are urging President Obama not to interfere in the review process for political reasons any longer.\nOn the Senate floor, McConnell said:The Keystone Jobs bill is just common sense.\nAnd the passage of bipartisan bills like Clay Hunt and Keystone Jobs shows we\u2019re doing just that.\nThe President and many others have pointed out that this bill is neither a jobs nor an infrastructure bill."}
