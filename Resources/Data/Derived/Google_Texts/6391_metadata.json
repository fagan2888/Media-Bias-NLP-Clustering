Pacanowski, in their new study.\n\nOverweight and obesity are major public health problems. Because eating patterns develop early in life, the researchers behind University of Minnesota\u2019s Project EAT (Eating and Activity in Teens and Young Adults) are attempting to identify the environmental, personal, and behavioral factors behind activity and eating specifically among teens and young adults. Sadly, during the past decade, results from Project EAT reveal the overall prevalence of obesity has increased, while ethnic/racial disparities have also escalated.\n\nRising Teen BMI Rates\n\nSpecifically, the most recent EAT 2010 survey revealed nearly 19 percent of girls and 26 percent of boys were at or above the 95th percentile for body mass index (BMI), the cut-off point used for defining obesity. Another 20 percent of girls and 16 percent of boys were overweight, according to the percentiles. For girls, obesity is most common among African-Americans, Hispanics, and Native Americans, and it is rising among Asian girls. For boys, obesity is most common among Hispanics, Asians, and Native Americans, with recent increases seen among African-American, Asian, and Hispanic youth.\n\nBottom line: 39 percent of girls and 42 percent of boys are currently overweight or obese, according to Project EAT.\n\nTo understand how just one behavior, self-weighing, plays into this disheartening trend, the current study surveyed 1,868 young adults in Project EAT. More than two thirds of the ethnically and socioeconomically diverse participants were not overweight, about a third were in middle school and two thirds in high school. Based on their BMI, self-reports, and psychological test results, the researchers assessed and ranked participants\u2019 weight concerns, body satisfaction, self-esteem, and depressive symptoms. The team also studied participants\u2019 extreme or unhealthy behaviors.\n\nWhat did they discover? Among the girls, increases in self-weighing were \u201csignificantly related\u201d to increases in weight concerns and depression, say the researchers. Getting on the scale frequently also linked to decreases in body satisfaction and self-esteem, according to the authors, plus some girls also reported extremely dangerous weight-control behaviors. Concluding, the authors of the study suggest one way their research could be put to good use by doctors and other health care providers.\n\nBecause stepping on the scale is not stigmatized, teens and young adults would probably feel comfortable reporting how often they weigh themselves (compared to, say, answering questions about depression or self-esteem). Self-weighing, the researchers concluded, might serve \u201cas a proxy for investigating other, more concerning changes in well-being.\u201d\n\nSource: Pacanowski CR, Loth KA, Hannan PJ, et al.
