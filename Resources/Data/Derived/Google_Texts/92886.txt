The University of Tulsa and Oklahoma State University have agreed to terms for a two-game series in men’s basketball and a three-game football series, it was announced today by TU’s Vice President and Director of Athletics Derrick Gragg in coordination with Oklahoma State University Athletic Director Mike Holder.

The two-year basketball agreement has the schools meeting in December 2015 at OSU’s Gallagher-Iba Arena and a year later, December 2016, at the Donald W. Reynolds Center on the TU campus. The exact dates of these games have not yet been established.

The three-game football series begins in 2019. The teams will open the series at Tulsa’s H.A. Chapman Stadium on September 14, 2019, followed by back-to-back games in Stillwater on Sept. 12, 2020 and Sept. 11, 2021. There is still one game remaining on the existing contract as Tulsa visits OSU in 2017.

“We’re excited to get Oklahoma State and their fans to our venues in the sports of men’s basketball and football,” said Gragg. “It’s obvious that both of these universities are held in extremely high regard in the city of Tulsa, the region and the state of Oklahoma. Continuing to play series’ in these two sports with Oklahoma State is a win-win situation for both schools.”

The last football game of the series was played in Tulsa when the Golden Hurricane fell to the seventh-ranked Cowboys 59-33 on Sept. 17, 2011. On the basketball court, the two teams last met at Gallagher-Iba Arena on Nov. 30, 2011 as Oklahoma State grabbed a 59-56 victory. Tulsa won the last time the two teams played at the Reynolds Center by a score of 86-65 on Dec. 2, 2009.

Terms of the contract was not disclosed.
