While the debate over the Affordable Care Act turned into an intensely partisan battle, nearly everybody in the United States is concerned about health care costs and quality of services. In this issue, Twin Cities Business is recognizing individuals who’ve taken the lead to improve health care outcomes while maintaining or reducing costs.

By following the links below, you’ll find profiles of the TCB Outstanding Health Care Award winners. The five honors are for: Lifetime Achievement, Community Outreach, Patient Experience, Procedure Innovation and Employer Initiative.

The winning innovations are being delivered in homes, a private workplace and in health care institutions.

These awards are issued at a time when a new report from PricewaterhouseCoopers, Medical Cost Trend: Behind the Numbers 2015, projects a 6.8 percent growth rate in health care spending for next year. The study measures spending in the employer-based market, which covers about 150 million Americans.

“Many local providers are looking for ways to take cost out of the system,” says Tim Michaels, Minneapolis health industries advisory leader for PwC. “They are looking at everything including administrative costs, group purchasing groups, supply chain economies and even reducing the electric bill.” He notes that declining reimbursements from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and commercial payers are “also putting pressure on labor costs and may result in workforce reductions.”
