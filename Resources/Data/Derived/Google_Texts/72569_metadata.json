Instead, they would pursue alternative, naturally based, remedies. At the time, representatives from Akron Children\u2019s told the court that without conventional chemotherapy, Sarah could die within a year.\n\nIn response to granting guardianship to registered nurse and attorney Maria Schimer, the Hershbergers soon left the country to seek out alternative treatment \u2014 a task made especially difficult given the Amish community\u2019s aversion to most forms of modern day travel. Schimer would eventually resign her guardianship in 2014 due to the difficulty of locating Sarah. Since then, the family has tried to overturn the original court ruling.\n\nAs reported by Reuters, Dunn came to his decision after determining that Sarah was healthy, active, and currently in remission, making sure to verify her condition via medical examinations, including MRI scans.\n\nHe, however, warned the Hershbergers to ensure that Sarah\u2019s health is being promptly taken care of at all times, since her cancer still has the possibility of recurring.\n\nIn a statement made to the Medina Gazette earlier this October, a representative of Akron Children\u2019s said, \u201cFamily-centered care has long been a tenet at Akron Children\u2019s Hospital. Our caregivers strive every day to involve parents in decision making and to respect the cultural differences of our patient families. We have been updated periodically by Sarah\u2019s family members through this committee and wish Sarah continued good health.\u201d\n\n\"Having a free society means that people need to be free to take risks, including risks with their family when they are suitable and loving parents who will take those risks out of a position of love and belief,\" said the Hershberger\u2019s attorney Maurice Thompson in a 2014 interview with Reason.tv. \"It's one thing for society, government, for experts to overrule parents who are abusive, or who are neglectful or who perhaps lack the capacity to properly care for their children, and it's imperative to emphasize that none of those are the case here.\"\n\nThompson is also the Executive Director of the 1851 Center for Constitutional Law, \u201ca non-profit, non-partisan legal center dedicated to protecting the constitutional rights of Ohioans from government abuse.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "chemotherapy, leukemia treatment, cancer care", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "An Amish family has won back the right to treat their daughter's cancer as they see fit.", "title": "Amish Girl Fighting Court-Ordered Cancer Care Finally Wins", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/amish-family-wins-chemotherapy-case-daughter-no-longer-forced-receive-leukemia-356942", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/10/12/hershbergers.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "An Amish family has won back the right to treat their daughter's cancer as they see fit.", "title": "Amish Girl Fighting Court-Ordered Cancer Care Finally Wins", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/amish-family-wins-chemotherapy-case-daughter-no-longer-forced-receive-leukemia-356942", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/10/12/hershbergers.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/10/12/hershbergers.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Hill", "published_time": "2015-10-12T19:03:12-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-10-12T20:29:33-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "An Amish family has won back the right to treat their daughter's cancer as they see fit."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2844\"", "article_summary": "In a statement made to the Medina Gazette earlier this October, a representative of Akron Children\u2019s said, \u201cFamily-centered care has long been a tenet at Akron Children\u2019s Hospital.\nAt the time, representatives from Akron Children\u2019s told the court that without conventional chemotherapy, Sarah could die within a year.\nIn 2013, Dunn\u2019s predecessor was ordered to appoint limited guardianship to the Akron Children's Hospital where Sarah previously received chemotherapy for the leukemia she developed earlier that year.\n12-year-old Sarah Hershberger, seen above 2nd from right in a photo taken this September, is no longer under the medical guardianship of anyone besides her parents.\nOur caregivers strive every day to involve parents in decision making and to respect the cultural differences of our patient families."}
