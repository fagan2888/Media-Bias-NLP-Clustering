The ABA has sent a letter to Bob Goodlatte, Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, which opposes a medical liability bill that caps non economic damages.

The ABA letter says, “States have had the authority to determine medical liability law for 200 years, and Congress should not substitute its judgment for the systems that have evolved over time.”

There are three provisions of the bill that the letter to Goodlatte opposes:

The bill would cap non economic damages such as pain and suffering at $250,000. According to the letter, research shows that damages caps “diminish access to the courts for low wage earners, like the elderly, children, and women. If economic damages are minor and non economic damages are capped, attorneys are less likely to represent these potential plaintiffs. The letter also notes that courts already have the power to reduce excessive verdicts through remittitur.

The bill imposes a “fair share” rule which states that each party is liable only for its share of the damages. At the state level, the ABA supports laws requiring defendants whose responsibility is substantially disproportionate to the entire loss to be liable for only their equitable share of the non economic loss. Therefore, the ABA opposes the fair share provision “to the extent that it would pre-empt existing state laws and to the extent that it would apply a proportionate liability rule to all damages, not just the plaintiff’s non economic damages,” the letter says.

The bill also has a provision that will allow judges to reduce contingent fees paid from a plaintiff’s damage award to an attorney, redirect damages to the plaintiff, and further reduce contingent fees in cases involving minors and incompetent persons. ABA policy says no justification exists for special restrictions on contingent fees in medical malpractice cases.
