The bill \u201creduces funding for nonessential areas, and holds the administration and the Internal Revenue Service more accountable to the taxpayer,\u201d said Financial Services Subcommittee Chairman Ander Crenshaw, R-Fla.\n\nOn Tuesday before committee action, the White House sent the panel a letter warning that the funding levels would diminish enforcement capabilities and \u201clock in unacceptable\u201d levels of service, such as the substandard support taxpayers now receive from call centers. The White House said the bill also would halt progress on projects such as the Criminal Investigation Identity Theft Clearinghouse, which aims to help IRS detect and quickly resolve tax return anomalies that can signal identity theft.\n\nTougher in tone was the statement from Colleen Kelley, national president of the National Treasury Employees Union, who called the bill a \u201cdraconian\u201d and \u201cdevasting\u201d return to the funding level of fiscal 1991, \u201cwhen the tax code was far less complicated and the country had 38 million fewer individual taxpayers, according to the Office of Management and Budget.\u201d\n\nNoting that the IRS budget shrunk by $1.2 billion from 2010 to 2015, NTEU specifically warned that funding for operations support and business systems modernization programs would be slashed by $338 million and $40 million, respectively, and enforcement programs would get $538 million less. \u201cCongress needs to provide the IRS with the resources necessary to carry out the responsibilities Congress has imposed on it,\u201d Kelley said.\n\nThe Senate Appropriations panel has not yet acted.\n\nAlso on Wednesday, the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration released a report concluding that \u201creduced budgets and collection resources at the Internal Revenue Service have resulted in declines in taxpayer service, case closures, and dollars collected.\u201d\n\nIt said the agency\u2019s Automated Collection Service has answered 25 percent fewer taxpayer telephone calls since 2011, and that \u201ctaxpayers whose calls were answered spent an average of eight minutes (97 percent) longer waiting for a representative than previously. Revenue officers collected $222 million (7 percent) less in fiscal 2014 than in 2011, the report said. Reductions in the number of revenue officers also meant they closed 34 percent fewer cases.\n\n\u201cThere is a significant correlation between the IRS\u2019s reduced collection budget and the reduction in efficiency and effectiveness of its collection operation,\u201d said J. Russell George, Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration. \u201cThe availability of key collection employees directly affects taxpayer service and the IRS\u2019s ability to take appropriate enforcement action on delinquent taxpayers,\u201d he said. \u201cTaxpayers may become frustrated and remain noncompliant if they are unable to reach a contact representative to resolve their tax issues.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Charles S.
