Melcher, who wrote that the people of the city of Chamberlain are opposed to \u201chaving Indians in our schools or living in the unsanitary conditions about the city.\u201d \u201cWe have no intention of making an Indian comfortable around here, especially an official,\u201d Melcher wrote.\n\nAttached to the letter is a resolution refusing to allow tribal offices in the town. The resolution was signed by Commissioners O.L. McDonal, Frank G. Knippling, Willard A. Wilin, and R.C. Martin. The letter was in opposition to relocating the Indian Office from Fort Thompson, South Dakota to Chamberlain.\n\nNo one involved in the quest for the Honor Song believes that the entire town of Chamberlain is as blatantly racist as it was more than half a century ago. However, there is a prevailing assumption that the tug-of-war over a song to honor all students is at least partly due to the racist history of the town.\n\n\u201cWhat we are getting back from them is pure racism,\u201d says James Cadwell, Santee, Crow Creek resident, and teacher at the Crow Creek schools for 14 years. \u201cHow do we work with them on being culturally competent? I don\u2019t think there is anyone there who has a conscious bias, but I do think it\u2019s an unconscious bias.\u201d\n\nCrow Creek Tribal Chairman Brandon Sazue believes the school is holding out over an issue of pride. \u201cI believe they are holding on and don\u2019t want to have to say, \u2018We let them beat us,\u2019 \u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIf the board says no, what can we do?\u201d Debra Johnson, school superintendent asked. Johnson and High School Principal Allan Bertram made the decision to incorporate the Honor Song in a special in-school assembly, \u201cAnd we will have the Honor Song at that assembly for the graduates. The principal and I have met with the students in the Native American Club, and they are the students who planned the feathering ceremony and the pow wow.\u201d\n\nWhen asked how she thought students might feel about not having the Honor Song sung at the graduation, Johnson said, \u201cI believe we do so many things to educate and show respect for the Native American culture, and we want all of our students to know that. It\u2019s hard to comment on one aspect when I see so many things that we do that show respect.\u201d\n\nHowever, Cadwell\u2019s response to the inclusion of the feathering ceremony and pow wow was, \u201cWe had to fight for all of that. They were going to do away with the pow wow. All the things they are touting, \u2018All we do,\u2019 they are required by Impact Aid.\u201d\n\nImpact Aid is federal funding for public schools that lack a strong tax base, either because of the number of military families or Native Americans.\n\nFor the last four years, students and parents from the Lower Brule and Crow Creek Reservations have been appealing to the Chamberlain Schools to include the Honor Song in the graduation ceremonies. A petition to include the Honor Song at the graduation was signed by 160 students and staff members. The Great Plains Tribal Association, composed of the elected chairs and presidents of Great Plains Nations, recently signed a resolution calling for the inclusion of the song.\n\nThe resolution states, \u201cAmerican Indian languages and Song are the repository of the collective wisdom, Spiritualism and culture of Native Nations, which contain ceremony, indigenous knowledge and traditions...that have been thousands of years in the making, and can lead to positive reinforcement of traditional values...\u201d The resolution also calls for a spirit of reconciliation from the Chamberlain School Board.\n\nSazue noted that the vote this year did show a slight change. Last year, the board voted 6 to 1 against the Honor Song. This year the vote was four against, with one vote for the song and one vote abstaining.\n\n\u201cDiversity is inevitable,\u201d Sazue said. \u201cAt the basketball games, we honor everybody; it\u2019s not about color. It\u2019s our tradition to honor everyone, it\u2019s the way we do it. I worked for the Crow Creek Elementary School and every morning, our kids get up and do the Pledge of Allegiance. We want to honor our schools and other districts, but for whatever reason, the elected officials don\u2019t want to.\u201d\n\nCadwell said, \u201cAs a person who grew up in Crow Creek, I never remember going to events where Native people didn\u2019t stand up for the National Anthem.\u201d Yet Cadwell said a recent demonstration of the song was played and the words interpreted for the school board, and two of the board members did not stand up. \u201cHow disrespectful of another person\u2019s culture, not standing up,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI believe there are a lot of good-minded people in Chamberlain who show a lot of support, I know a lot of good people personally,\u201d Sazue said. \u201cThese children are learning about diversity. No matter what color you are or what song you sing, it\u2019s about equality amongst all people.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Many wonder if a racist history is to blame for the Chamberlain School District's refusal to allow an Honor Song to be sung at graduation.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2013/12/13/could-racist-history-be-preventing-honor-song-being-sung-152707", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "image": "http://d1jrw5jterzxwu.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/article_media/chamberlain-honor-song-protest.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "Is Racism Behind Banning of Honor Song From Graduation Ceremonies?"}, "robots": "follow, index", "dc": {"title": "Is Racism Behind Banning of Honor Song From Graduation Ceremonies?"}, "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2013/12/13/could-racist-history-be-preventing-honor-song-being-sung-152707", "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.creator": "leeanne", "dcterms.date": "2013-12-13T14:19-05:00", "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Chamberlain School District, Honor Song, Graduation, Native American students, Native American History, Racism Against Native Americans, Racism, South Dakota, Crow Creek", "validation_code": "d9d37d7b776cc351c4025ded3df21cad", "sioc": {"num_replies": 2}, "dcterms.title": "Is Racism Behind Banning of Honor Song From Graduation Ceremonies?"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc99db\"", "article_summary": "\u201cWhat we are getting back from them is pure racism,\u201d says James Cadwell, Santee, Crow Creek resident, and teacher at the Crow Creek schools for 14 years.\nJohnson and High School Principal Allan Bertram made the decision to incorporate the Honor Song in a special in-school assembly, \u201cAnd we will have the Honor Song at that assembly for the graduates.\nA petition to include the Honor Song at the graduation was signed by 160 students and staff members.\nLast year, the board voted 6 to 1 against the Honor Song.\nA history of racism lurks in the shadows of Chamberlain, South Dakota\u2019s past, and many see the Chamberlain School District\u2019s refusal to allow the Honor Song to be played at graduation (again) as evidence of that continuing disrespect."}
