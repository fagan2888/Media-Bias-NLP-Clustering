A string of acquisitions has benefited the businesses and helped it claim market share, driving sales growth despite adverse exchange rates that make its services more expensive abroad.\n\nLast year, Accenture bought cloud-computing consultancy Cloud Sherpas, which helps companies implement Google Inc. and Salesforce.com Inc. technologies. Other recent acquisitions include Formicary, which services trading platforms, and cybersecurity services firm Cimation.\n\n\"We are benefiting from the focused investments we are making to rotate our business to new, high-growth areas,\" said Chief Executive Pierre Nanterme, pointing to a strong first half of the company's fiscal year for its guidance lift.\n\nFor the year, Accenture now expects to earn an adjusted $5.21 to $5.32 a share, up from its previous forecast of $5.09 to $5.24. The company expects revenue to increase a currency-adjusted 8% to 10%, up from 6% to 9% previously. A lower tax rate is also expected to boost results this year, the company said.\n\nIn the last quarter, Accenture saw sales rise across most of its business segments, paced by a 12% jump in health and public services. The company has worked to improve the HealthCare.gov website used by Americans to sign up for health insurance under the Affordable Care Act and has won contracts to continue its work on the site.\n\nOver all for its fiscal second quarter ended Feb. 29, Accenture reported a profit of $1.40 billion, or $2.08 a share, up from a loss of $495.3 million, or 74 cents a share, a year earlier.
