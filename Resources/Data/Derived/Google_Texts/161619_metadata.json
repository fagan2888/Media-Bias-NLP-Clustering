Waldack eventually lost his fortune, left the country and died in 2007. The Ricketts Apple-1 was auctioned at a self-storage facility in Virginia, where Luther purchased it.\n\nAn Apple-1 expert serviced and started the computer, running the standard original software program, Microsoft BASIC, and an original Apple-1 Star Trek game to test it out, Christie's said.\n\nThe computer will be sold with the canceled check from the original garage purchase on July 27, 1976 made out to Apple Computer by Charles Ricketts for $600, which Ricketts later labeled as \"Purchased July 1976 from Steve Jobs in his parents\u2019 garage in Los Altos\".\n\nA second canceled check for $193 from Aug. 5, 1976 is labeled \u201cSoftware NA Programmed by Steve Jobs August 1976.\u201d The checks were used as evidence for the city of Los Altos to designate the Jobs family home on Crist Drive for eligibility for listing on the National Register of Historic Places.\n\nLast month, the Henry Ford organization paid $905,000 at auction for one of the few remaining Apple-1 computers, which was more than twice the pre-sale estimate. Fewer than 50 original Apple-1s are believed to be in existence of the few hundred originally produced.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "A fully operational Apple computer that company co-founder Steve Jobs sold out of his", "title": "Steve Jobs\u2019 Own Apple Computer Could Fetch $600K", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2014/11/03/Steve-Jobs-Own-Apple-Computer-Could-Fetch-600K", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/10242011_Steve_Jobs_Quotes_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2014/11/03/Steve-Jobs-Own-Apple-Computer-Could-Fetch-600K", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/10242011_Steve_Jobs_Quotes_article.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "A fully operational Apple computer that company co-founder Steve Jobs sold out of his", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "A fully operational Apple computer that company co-founder Steve Jobs sold out of his parents' garage in 1976 for $600 will hit the auction block in December, where it is expected to fetch more than half a million dollars, Christie's said on Monday.\nThe Ricketts Apple-1 was auctioned at a self-storage facility in Virginia, where Luther purchased it.\n\"My computer had been purchased directly from Jobs, and based on the buyers address on the check, he lived four miles from Jobs.\"\nThe computer will be sold with the canceled check from the original garage purchase on July 27, 1976 made out to Apple Computer by Charles Ricketts for $600, which Ricketts later labeled as \"Purchased July 1976 from Steve Jobs in his parents\u2019 garage in Los Altos\".\nAn Apple-1 expert serviced and started the computer, running the standard original software program, Microsoft BASIC, and an original Apple-1 Star Trek game to test it out, Christie's said."}
