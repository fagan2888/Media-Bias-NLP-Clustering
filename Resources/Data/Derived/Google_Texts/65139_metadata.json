In some cases, symptoms may overwhelm the respiratory system and lead to death.\n\nInfants receive their first dose of the whooping cough vaccine at two months of age, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) vaccination schedule. They don\u2019t complete the full course of three doses until they\u2019re six months old, however.\n\nAs a way to protect infants younger than six months old, some researchers and public health officials have called for so-called cocooning, which is the vaccination of people who often come in contact with the child.\n\nThe vaccine offered to adults as a booster shot is known as Tdap. Children receive a shot known as DTaP.\n\nQuinn and her colleagues write in Pediatrics that there has been limited evidence on whether the cocooning method works.\n\nFor the new study, they analyzed data collected between April 2009 and April 2011 on Australian infants younger than four months, including 217 who were diagnosed with whooping cough and 585 who remained healthy.\n\nIn homes where the babies stayed healthy, 32 percent of mothers had received a Tdap vaccine at least four weeks before the data were collected. Among the babies with whooping cough, however, only 22 percent of mothers had received a Tdap vaccine.\n\nSimilar results were seen among fathers. After the researchers accounted for traits that may affect an infant\u2019s risk of catching whooping cough, including the number of brothers and sisters, they found that vaccinating both parents is tied to a 51 percent reduced risk of whooping cough in a child under four months old.\n\nVaccinating the mother appeared to be especially important, reducing the risk of whooping cough by 42 percent alone. Vaccinating the fathers increased that protection to a 51 percent reduced risk. Quinn said more research is needed to know when is the best time for parents to get the Tdap vaccine.\n\n\u201cIn the United States, where vaccination during pregnancy is recommended, this is still the best recommendation,\u201d she said.\n\nThe CDC says pregnant women should receive the Tdap vaccine between the 27th and 36th week. The recommendation is supported by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American College of Nurse-Midwives. Quinn also said other family members and close contacts share the responsibility of keeping infants healthy.\n\n\u201cIt is very important that other household members, such as siblings, are up to date with vaccinations, as they can also be a source of infection for very young babies,\u201d she said.\n\nBy Andrew M.
