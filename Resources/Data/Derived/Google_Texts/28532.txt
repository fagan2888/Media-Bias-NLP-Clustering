PHOENIX (AP) — Intense storms swept through the Southwest on Saturday, snapping trees and shrouding metropolitan Phoenix in cascading showers while also bringing flooding to parts of Nevada.

The skies above downtown Phoenix were completely gray in the afternoon as strong winds, thunder and rain hit the region. The outside visibility of buildings was almost entirely obscured by rain and clouds.

The storm forced authorities to close a section of Interstate 17 in Phoenix, with no estimated time for when the freeway would re-open.

Branches and debris littered streets around the city and at least one traffic light was knocked over. Some trees were toppled by the ensuing wind. The Salt River Project utility said that more than 14,000 customers were without power.

Most of the outages were in west and northwest Phoenix, with smaller clusters reported in Scottsdale, Mesa and Tempe. Utility officials estimated that power would be restored sometime Saturday afternoon.

The weather was a mix of Phoenix’s first fall storm and leftover monsoon moisture, National Weather Service meteorologist Marvin Percha said. Between ½ inch and 1 inch of rain was expected with more in localized spots.

In southeast Nevada’s rural Moapa Valley, heavy rains brought flooding but authorities say that despite a river cresting at a record high, the damage wasn’t as bad as what was caused by high waters in the area earlier in the month.
