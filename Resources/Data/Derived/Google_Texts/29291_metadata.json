A judge ordered Brent to spend at least 45 days in a residential facility for substance abuse as part of his sentence of 10 years of probation.\n\nBrent avoided prison time at trial \u2014 he faced up to 20 years \u2014 and at 26, he could presumably seek to re-enter the league. His agent, Peter Schaffer, declined Monday to discuss Brent\u2019s pro prospects.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s up to the treatment professionals as to what\u2019s best for him and he will do whatever they think is best,\u201d Schaffer said. \u201cNothing else matters right now.\u201d\n\nBrent and Brown were headed home from a nightclub in December 2012 when Brent lost control of his Mercedes and crashed on a suburban Dallas highway. Officers arriving at the scene saw Brent trying to pull Brown\u2019s body from the wreckage.\n\nTests showed Brent\u2019s blood-alcohol level was 0.18 percent, more than twice the state\u2019s legal limit for drivers. A prosecution expert estimated that the 320-pound lineman would have had to have as many as 17 drinks on the night of the crash.\n\nBrent did not play after the crash and announced his retirement from the Cowboys before the trial. League spokesman Greg Aiello said Monday that Brent can apply for reinstatement through the office of NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell, who must also consider whether to discipline Brent under the league\u2019s personal conduct policy.\n\nAs a possible precedent, Goodell suspended NFL wide receiver Donte Stallworth for the entire 2009 season after Stallworth pleaded guilty to a DUI manslaughter charge in Florida.\n\nWhile acknowledging that the league will have \u201ca big say\u201d in Brent\u2019s future, Cowboys executive vice president Stephen Jones said recently that the team had not ruled out his return. Team executives and players have stood by Brent after the crash, with the support of Brown\u2019s mother, Stacey Jackson.\n\nBrent was starting in place of the injured Jay Ratliff at the time of the crash, and had 31 tackles in 39 games over three seasons in Dallas.\n\nDallas County prosecutors have said they won\u2019t object to Brent attempting a comeback, as long as he doesn\u2019t violate his probation. Brent was jailed briefly before trial after testing positive twice for marijuana. His probation conditions are expected to include restrictions on drug use and travel.\n\nFollow Nomaan Merchant on Twitter at www.twitter.com/nomaanmerchant and Schuyler Dixon at www.twitter.com/apschuyler", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9fc9\"", "article_summary": "DALLAS \u2014 Former Dallas Cowboys tackle Josh Brent will spend at least 45 days in rehab following his release from jail in the drunken-driving death of a teammate and a return to his former team remains a possibility.\nBrent avoided prison time at trial \u2014 he faced up to 20 years \u2014 and at 26, he could presumably seek to re-enter the league.\nTeam executives and players have stood by Brent after the crash, with the support of Brown\u2019s mother, Stacey Jackson.\nBrent did not play after the crash and announced his retirement from the Cowboys before the trial.\nDallas County prosecutors have said they won\u2019t object to Brent attempting a comeback, as long as he doesn\u2019t violate his probation."}
