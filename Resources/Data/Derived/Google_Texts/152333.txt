Washingtonians are planning a "sled-in" Thursday to protest a sledding ban on the Capitol grounds.

"Despite efforts, the sled ban has not been waived for this weekend," a post on the D.C. neighborhood blog Popville reads.

"But if you are up for a little civil disobedience, a sled-in is planned for today at 1pm. West lawn of the Capitol. Come armed with sleds! #sleddingisnotacrime #SledFreeOrDie."

Ahead of Thursday's snowstorm, D.C. Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton asked U.S. Capitol Police to lift the sledding ban on Capitol grounds. But Capitol Police Board Chairman Frank Larkin wouldn't budge, arguing that it could become a slippery slope, though he did agreed to review the regulations.

“The nation's capital is teeming with families and young children who are the latest generation to regard sledding on 'America's front lawn' during our rare snowstorms as one of our oldest and best traditions,” Holmes Norton said in a statement.

"I do not believe that is too much to ask for the Capitol Grounds, which are used for walking dogs and other activities, in a city that has so few snowfalls can accommodate sledding."
