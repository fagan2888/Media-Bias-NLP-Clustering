Last year there was a major decline in the bee population. To help increase that number, the Tupelo Beekeepers Association held a hive demonstration and beginner bee class Saturday.

Bee experts said they host the event once a year for the public to encourage backyard beekeeping. The class also teaches those interested in pursuing beekeeping on how to do it, and what is required by the state. Those who attended the class were able to see live demonstrations on how to process the honey.

"If our bees die, there's a good chance we're going to die depending on what scientist you talk to, so that's why we're really encouraging backyard bee keepers and it's a fun hobby to get into, at least I think it's a fun hobby to get into," Daniel Morthland, the owner of D & C Honey Farm said.
