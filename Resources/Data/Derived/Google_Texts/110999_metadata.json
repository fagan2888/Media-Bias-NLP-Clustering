The assessment suggests that neither the election of President Hassan Rouhani nor the prospect of a nuclear accord with the United States and its negotiating partners has had a moderating effect on Iran\u2019s foreign policy in the Middle East. \u201cIn 2014, Iran continued to provide arms, financing, training and the facilitation of primarily Iraq Shia and Afghan fighters to support the Assad regime\u2019s brutal crackdown,\u201d the report said. \u201cIran remained unwilling to bring to justice senior Al Qaeda members it continued to detain and refused to publicly identify those senior members in its custody,\u201d it added...paints a picture of an aggressive Iranian foreign policy that has often been contrary to the interests of the United States. Even when the United States and Iran have a common foe, as they do in the Islamic State, the Iranian role in Iraq risks inflaming sectarian tensions...Although the report covers 2014, American officials said the Iranian policies described in it had continued this year.\n\nState Department spokesman John Kirby also stressed to reporters that there wasn't \"any kind of concession or change in the policy. It's just simply not true.\" Instead, he said, \"the sanctions lifting will only occur as Iran takes the steps agreed, including addressing possible military dimensions.\" But he added, \"We've said we're not looking for a confession (from Iran); we've already made judgments about the past.\" The U.S. and five world powers negotiating with Iran have long stipulated that Iran come clean about any past efforts to develop a military dimension to its nuclear program. U.S. officials and European diplomats have pledged that sanctions relief would be tied to Iran answering lingering questions from the International Atomic Energy Agency, the UN nuclear watchdog.\n\nInstead of insisting that the final agreement be regarded as a treaty, requiring the support of two-thirds of the chamber for ratification, Corker proposed letting naysayers try to block the treaty with a resolution of disapproval instead. The resolution could be filibustered by Democrats before it\u2019s enacted, or it could be enacted and then vetoed by Obama. The only way to guarantee that the resolution will become law is to have a veto-proof majority \u2014 two-thirds of the Senate \u2014 willing to vote against it, a near-impossibility when the GOP controls only 54 seats. Corker, in other words, reversed the constitutional presumption that treaties are deemed blocked unless they receive supermajority support so that a final agreement with Iran will be deemed passed unless it receives supermajority opposition.\n\n(a) prohibits the administration from lifting any sanctions over a two-month review period, (b) forces the White House to turn over every single page of the finalized deal's text, and (c) establishes a recurring 90-day review cycle that persists throughout the duration of the deal. All three of these provisions are valuable: The full text allows opponents to research the granular details and verbiage of the actual accord itself, not a White House \"fact sheet.\" The freeze gives critics a chance to flood the public discussion with substantive criticisms of the agreement. And the ongoing reviews offer a mechanism for a future president to pull the plug.\n\na committed US enemy over the clearly-stated will of Congress. This would give Republicans ample ammunition to further delegitimize the move. In the age of Obama, this is -- dispiritingly -- their best play. I'll leave you with this.
