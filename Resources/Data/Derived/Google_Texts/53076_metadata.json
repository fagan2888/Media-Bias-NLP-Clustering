He diagnoses plays. He makes plays. He makes players around him better. When the Broncos entered the playoffs in January, teammates suggested privately that Denver couldn\u2019t reach the Super Bowl without a healthy Marshall, who was injured at the time. Marshall somehow logged 40 snaps in the numbing home playoff loss to Indianapolis, but clearly was not himself.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of a miracle when I think about it now. Something mentally clicked to just allow me to get through it,\u201d Marshall said. \u201cI had it my mind that it was a sprain.\u201d\n\nIf only that were the case, one of the primary concerns about the Broncos\u2019 defense \u2014 the health of Marshall and Danny Trevathan (knee) \u2014 wouldn\u2019t exist. Marshall believes he will be ready when training camp opens in late July.\n\n\u201cI have no reason to believe I won\u2019t,\u201d Marshall said last week.\n\nThe Broncos showed faith in him by not drafting a linebacker. And yet, a challenge remains.\n\nHope turned to concern a month after the 2014 season ended. His right foot, injured Dec. 14 at San Diego when a Chargers offensive lineman fell on it, failed to improve. Marshall underwent a magnetic resonance imaging exam and sought a second opinion from Dr. Robert Anderson, a premier foot specialist in Charlotte, N.C. Anderson performed surgery March 11 to repair ligament damage.\n\nMarshall\u2019s confidence remains palpable, but his return to full health soon remains a leap of faith. The recommended recovery time from Lisfranc surgery is five to six months, suggesting the former Nevada star won\u2019t be 100 percent until mid-August. He recognizes the fraught caused by Lisfranc problems. It ended the career of likely Hall of Fame cornerback Champ Bailey, hindered offensive tackle Ryan Clady\u2019s performance deep into last season and knocked out tailback Ronnie Hillman for six weeks. Former Broncos safety Duke Ihenacho dealt with the injury in college. Marshall valued their advice.\n\n\u201cI have talked to Ronnie, Ryan, Duke. They have told me what to expect. Ryan said his still ached. But they all said it was something I could push through,\u201d said Marshall, his voice rising. \u201cI have persevered my whole life, and ever since I have been in the league. Trust me, there\u2019s nothing too big, there\u2019s nothing on my plate I can\u2019t handle. I will be able to be the player I was.\u201d\n\nThe idea of Marshall in coordinator Wade Phillips\u2019 new 3-4 defense remains tantalizing. Marshall profiles well given his lateral quickness \u2014 this will be a key test in his return \u2014 and ability to shed blockers. He plays \u201cfull throttle,\u201d said veteran pass rusher DeMarcus Ware.\n\nPhillips excels at creating pressure. Defensive line coach Bill Kollar schools his players in using different looks to create gaps for a linebacker-friendly defense.\n\n\u201cI really want us to be the No. 1 defense in the NFL,\u201d Marshall said, \u201cand being No. 1 in takeaways will help us reach our goal. I definitely think this is our time. We want to be the difference. We want people to know who we are when they walk onto the field. We want them to fear us and feel our presence.\u201d\n\nThe Broncos begin each practice with a defensive pursuit drill, featuring 11 players chasing the ball well down the field. Energy, effort, drive, aggression. The elements required to excel in this scheme mirror Marshall\u2019s strengths.\n\n\u201cBrandon means a lot to our defense. He\u2019s a great player. He\u2019s very vocal,\u201d said defensive end Malik Jackson. \u201cYou know what he says is going to be right. There are no mistakes from Brandon.\u201d\n\nMarshall has shown hints of healing ahead of schedule. He has jogged between stations at recent practices, and backpedaled lightly in the trainer\u2019s room. It\u2019s only his foot, he tells himself. He\u2019s been through much worse, crawling up depth charts, silencing doubters.\n\n\u201cI am still hungry,\u201d Marshall said. \u201cI feel like I have a lot to prove. I am not going to sit back and say, \u2018I had a good season. Cool.\u2019 That\u2019s not me. I am going to build on that, and do everything possible to get back on the field to help my team.\u201d\n\nTroy E.
