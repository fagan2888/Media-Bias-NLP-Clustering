A local group of bikers showed Saturday that despite the tough leather they wear outside, on the inside, they're soft-hearted.

For 14 years, Chunky River H.O.G. has been teaming up with the Chunky River Harley Davidson for its annual Toy Run. The bikers brought in hundreds of toys today, which will be distributed to kids in need by the Salvation Army. Director Doug Bates says this event is a win-win for everyone who rides.

"We like to ride first. Then we can ride and do something else good, too. So that's the whole purpose," he says.

Santa led the way for this brigade on his one-of-a-kind motorcycle. These toys will be added to the salvation army's already-huge collection. Bates says this event has grown every year. And next year's goal is to fill up two trucks instead of just one.
