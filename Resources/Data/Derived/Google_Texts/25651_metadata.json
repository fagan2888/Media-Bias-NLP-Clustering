And in the af\u00adter\u00admath of Mitt Rom\u00adney\u2019s de\u00adfeat in the 2012 pres\u00adid\u00aden\u00adtial elec\u00adtion, Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adans across the coun\u00adtry were do\u00ading just that. Among the GOP\u2019s elec\u00adted of\u00adfi\u00adcials, strategists, and act\u00adiv\u00adists, there was wide\u00adspread ac\u00adknow\u00adledg\u00adment that the Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adan Party suffered from a dis\u00adease that would not quickly be cured.\n\nNowhere was this ad\u00admis\u00adsion clear\u00ader than in\u00adside the Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adan Na\u00adtion\u00adal Com\u00admit\u00adtee, where Chair\u00adman Re\u00adince Priebus ap\u00adpoin\u00adted a five-per\u00adson task force \u2014 the Growth and Op\u00adpor\u00adtun\u00adity Pro\u00adject \u2014 to identi\u00adfy the party\u2019s fore\u00admost prob\u00adlems and ex\u00adplore po\u00adten\u00adtial solu\u00adtions. As this RNC autopsy was un\u00adder\u00adway, we at Na\u00adtion\u00adal Journ\u00adal con\u00adduc\u00adted our own post-mortem, speak\u00ading with sev\u00ader\u00adal mem\u00adbers of that RNC pan\u00adel, along with dozens more Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adans na\u00adtion\u00adwide. The res\u00adult was \u201cA 12-Step Pro\u00adgram for the Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adan Party,\u201d pre\u00adscrib\u00ading a road to re\u00adhab\u00adil\u00adit\u00ada\u00adtion for the GOP.\n\nThis week the RNC cel\u00adeb\u00adrated the one-year an\u00adniversary of its Growth and Op\u00adpor\u00adtun\u00adity Pro\u00adject\u2019s re\u00adport. Priebus and his pan\u00adel\u00adists boas\u00adted that many of the party\u2019s most ur\u00adgent short\u00adcom\u00adings were ad\u00addressed over the past 12 months, es\u00adpe\u00adcially those re\u00adlat\u00ading to \u201cground game\u201d and cam\u00adpaign in\u00adfra\u00adstruc\u00adture.

So, rather than eval\u00adu\u00adate GOP head\u00adway ac\u00adcord\u00ading to the RNC\u2019s own met\u00adrics, what fol\u00adlows is Na\u00adtion\u00adal Journ\u00adal\u2018s 2014 pro\u00adgress re\u00adport of the Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adan Party, based on our 2013 pre\u00adscrip\u00adtions:\n\nStep 2: Go Out\u00adside Your Com\u00adfort Zone\n\nPre\u00adscrip\u00adtion: En\u00adgage non\u00adtra\u00addi\u00adtion\u00adal GOP voters (es\u00adpe\u00adcially minor\u00adit\u00adies and young people).\n\nPro\u00adgress: B- \u201c\u00a6 Rand Paul, the sen\u00adat\u00ador from Ken\u00adtucky, told us that Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adans need to be go\u00ading in\u00adto urb\u00adan com\u00admunit\u00adies and pitch\u00ading their ideas, des\u00adpite know\u00ading those ef\u00adforts won\u2019t pay off im\u00adme\u00addi\u00adately. Paul has been a lead\u00ader in this re\u00adgard, speak\u00ading at black col\u00adleges and far-left cam\u00adpuses, as well as open\u00ading an RNC of\u00adfice in De\u00adtroit. Ad\u00addi\u00adtion\u00adally, House Ma\u00adjor\u00adity Lead\u00ader Eric Can\u00adtor has been tour\u00ading cit\u00adies to pro\u00admote school choice. But too few Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adans are fol\u00adlow\u00ading their lead. Oth\u00aders, such as Rep. Paul Ry\u00adan, have made com\u00admend\u00adable ef\u00adforts. But Ry\u00adan\u2019s \u201cin\u00adar\u00adtic\u00adu\u00adlate\u201d com\u00adments about the work eth\u00adic among black men showed why some Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adans are reti\u00adcent to en\u00adgage new vot\u00ading blocs.\n\nStep 3: Speak Their Lan\u00adguage\n\nPre\u00adscrip\u00adtion: Present a softer mes\u00adsage, and smarter policy solu\u00adtions, to the His\u00adpan\u00adic com\u00admunity.\n\nPro\u00adgress: D+ \u201c\u00a6 This was pri\u00ador\u00adity No. 1 among most Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adans after Rom\u00adney won just 27 per\u00adcent of His\u00adpan\u00adics in 2012. Party lead\u00aders called for Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adans to tone down their im\u00admig\u00adra\u00adtion rhet\u00ador\u00adic, and moreover, of\u00adfer policy solu\u00adtions bey\u00adond \u201cself-de\u00adport\u00ada\u00adtion.\u201d Ef\u00adforts on both fronts have been in\u00adcon\u00adsist\u00adent. Sen\u00adate Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adans, in\u00adclud\u00ading Marco Ru\u00adbio, helped craft a com\u00adpre\u00adhens\u00adive bill that would cre\u00adate a path to leg\u00adal\u00adiz\u00ada\u00adtion for many un\u00addoc\u00adu\u00admented im\u00admig\u00adrants. But House Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adans balked, in\u00adsist\u00ading that bor\u00adders must be demon\u00adstrably se\u00adcure be\u00adfore leg\u00adal\u00adiz\u00ada\u00adtion is dis\u00adcussed. That policy in\u00ader\u00adtia is un\u00adhelp\u00adful but not fatal; what\u2019s more dam\u00adaging is com\u00adment\u00adary, like that from Rep. Steve King about \u201ccalves the size of can\u00adta\u00adloupes,\u201d that con\u00adtin\u00adues to paint Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adans as cold and un\u00adcar\u00ading about His\u00adpan\u00adic voters.\n\nStep 4: Go Big on Edu\u00adca\u00adtion\n\nPre\u00adscrip\u00adtion: Draw a sharp con\u00adtrast between parties on the is\u00adsue of school choice.\n\nPro\u00adgress: D \u201c\u00a6 Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adans re\u00admain con\u00advinced that edu\u00adca\u00adtion is the X factor that could im\u00adprove its stand\u00adings among cru\u00adcial demo\u00adgraph\u00adics \u2014 wo\u00admen and urb\u00adan res\u00adid\u00adents es\u00adpe\u00adcially \u2014 who worry about the health of the na\u00adtion\u2019s pub\u00adlic-edu\u00adca\u00adtion sys\u00adtem. \u201cNo oth\u00ader is\u00adsue even comes close in its po\u00adten\u00adtial for the Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adan Party,\u201d former Rep. Ar\u00adtur Dav\u00adis, a de\u00adfect\u00ador from the Demo\u00adcrat\u00adic Party, told us. Edu\u00adca\u00adtion speaks to the broad\u00ader theme of \u201cup\u00adward mo\u00adbil\u00adity,\u201d ad\u00added Henry Bar\u00adbour, an RNC pan\u00adel\u00adist. Yet in the past year we\u2019ve seen little ef\u00adfort \u2014 at least on the na\u00adtion\u00adal stage \u2014 to make this part of the na\u00adtion\u00adal dia\u00adlogue. Sen. Ted Cruz, a po\u00adten\u00adtial 2016 can\u00addid\u00adate, told Iow\u00adans re\u00adcently that \u201cschool choice is the civil-rights is\u00adsue of the 21st cen\u00adtury.\u201d Rom\u00adney said something eer\u00adily sim\u00adil\u00adar in 2012, yet failed to force a de\u00adbate on the top\u00adic. Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adans would be wise to learn from Rom\u00adney\u2019s fail\u00adure.\n\nStep 5: Let the Liber\u00adtari\u00adan Flag Fly\n\nPre\u00adscrip\u00adtion: Ex\u00adpand the party by al\u00adlow\u00ading liber\u00adtari\u00adan voices to at\u00adtract new, young voters.\n\nPro\u00adgress: A \u201c\u00a6 To the chag\u00adrin of tra\u00addi\u00adtion\u00adal de\u00adfense hawks such as Sen.

Paul\u2019s 13-hour fili\u00adbuster chal\u00adlen\u00adging the use of drones on do\u00admest\u00adic soil cap\u00adtured the sus\u00adpi\u00adcion that young Amer\u00adic\u00adans feel to\u00adward the fed\u00ader\u00adal gov\u00adern\u00adment; and Amash\u2019s amend\u00adment to re\u00adstrict bulk data col\u00adlec\u00adtion by the Na\u00adtion\u00adal Se\u00adcur\u00adity Agency nearly won on the House floor des\u00adpite op\u00adpos\u00adi\u00adtion from the White House, the Pentagon, and the lead\u00ader\u00adship of both parties.\n\nStep 6: Bring Back the Boot\u00adstraps\n\nPre\u00adscrip\u00adtion: Em\u00adphas\u00adize op\u00adpor\u00adtun\u00adity for av\u00ader\u00adage Amer\u00adic\u00adans, not handouts for big busi\u00adnesses.\n\nPro\u00adgress: C- \u201c\u00a6 There was ad\u00added ur\u00adgency to this im\u00adper\u00adat\u00adive when me\u00addia nar\u00adrat\u00adives dic\u00adtated that 2014\u2019s polit\u00adic\u00adal cli\u00admate would be driv\u00aden by \u201cin\u00adcome in\u00adequal\u00adity.\u201d Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adans, des\u00adpite tak\u00ading heat for res\u00adist\u00ading an\u00adoth\u00ader ex\u00adten\u00adsion to un\u00adem\u00adploy\u00adment in\u00adsur\u00adance, are mak\u00ading genu\u00adine ef\u00adforts to rebrand them\u00adselves. Many con\u00adser\u00advat\u00adives are talk\u00ading boldly about end\u00ading \u201ccor\u00adpor\u00adate wel\u00adfare\u201d through the tax code and even re\u00addir\u00adect\u00ading some fund\u00ading to\u00adward job train\u00ading pro\u00adgrams. Ry\u00adan has been vis\u00adit\u00ading poor areas and float\u00ading an\u00adti\u00adpoverty ini\u00adti\u00adat\u00adives. Oth\u00ader House Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adans, mean\u00adwhile, have worked with the Her\u00adit\u00adage Found\u00ada\u00adtion to re\u00advis\u00adit wel\u00adfare re\u00adforms aimed at push\u00ading new people in\u00adto the work\u00adforce. Still, these words haven\u2019t been backed by con\u00adsist\u00adent, con\u00adcrete le\u00adgis\u00adlat\u00adive ac\u00adtion to pro\u00admote so\u00adcial mo\u00adbil\u00adity.\n\nStep 7: Just Say Yes\n\nPre\u00adscrip\u00adtion: Po\u00ads\u00adi\u00adtion Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adans as pro\u00adact\u00adive, rather than re\u00adact\u00adive, on the is\u00adsue of health care.\n\nPro\u00adgress: D- \u201c\u00a6 Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adans prom\u00adised an al\u00adtern\u00adat\u00adive to the Af\u00adford\u00adable Care Act upon seiz\u00ading the House ma\u00adjor\u00adity in 2011. Three years later, no such plan has reached the House floor \u2014 just a bunch of votes to re\u00adpeal Obama\u00adcare. This has spawned tre\u00admend\u00adous ten\u00adsion with\u00adin the House GOP, where con\u00adser\u00advat\u00adive mem\u00adbers, tired of Obama\u2019s claim that they lack policy solu\u00adtions, have pro\u00adduced com\u00adpre\u00adhens\u00adive plans that nev\u00ader re\u00adceive a vote. Can\u00adtor has prom\u00adised Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adans a vote this year on a health care bill, but it\u2019s likely to be a hodge\u00adpodge of pro\u00advi\u00adsions rather than a full-scale re\u00adplace\u00adment. GOP lead\u00ader\u00adship, es\u00adpe\u00adcially House Speak\u00ader John Boehner, seems con\u00adtent to make 2014 a ref\u00ader\u00aden\u00addum on Obama\u00adcare. That might work short-term, but Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adans won\u2019t have last\u00ading suc\u00adcess without a vis\u00adion of their own.\n\nStep 8: Leave the Labs Alone\n\nPre\u00adscrip\u00adtion: Al\u00adlow state parties, and gov\u00adernors, to lead the Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adan re\u00adsur\u00adgence.\n\nPro\u00adgress: D \u201c\u00a6 \u201cThe re\u00adbuild\u00ading of the party has to be\u00adgin out in the states,\u201d Kev\u00adin Mad\u00adden, who worked both Rom\u00adney pres\u00adid\u00aden\u00adtial cam\u00adpaigns, told us after the 2012 elec\u00adtion. While the GOP no longer has the con\u00adcrete policy ex\u00adamples it did years ago (Mitch Daniels\u2019s privat\u00adiz\u00ada\u00adtion ef\u00adforts in In\u00addi\u00adana, Jeb Bush\u2019s edu\u00adca\u00adtion re\u00adforms in Flor\u00adida), there are non\u00adethe\u00adless some ef\u00adfect\u00adive blue\u00adprints be\u00ading laid. Two of the GOP\u2019s suc\u00adcess\u00adful battle\u00adground gov\u00adernors, Ohio\u2019s John Kasich and Michigan\u2019s Rick Snyder, have achieved con\u00adser\u00advat\u00adive res\u00adults by strad\u00addling the cen\u00adter on oth\u00ader policy fights. Both al\u00adlowed Medi\u00adcaid ex\u00adpan\u00adsion in their states, for ex\u00adample, which af\u00adforded them polit\u00adic\u00adal cap\u00adit\u00adal to push tax cuts and bal\u00adanced budgets. It\u2019s a dif\u00adfi\u00adcult mod\u00adel for Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adans on the Hill to fol\u00adlow, however, be\u00adcause they simply don\u2019t trust Obama \u2014 and there\u00adfore are un\u00adwill\u00ading to ad\u00adopt this give-and-take ap\u00adproach. Mean\u00adwhile, oth\u00ader states have demon\u00adstrated what policy fights are worth pur\u00adsu\u00ading (Wis\u00adcon\u00adsin\u2019s en\u00adti\u00adtle\u00adment re\u00adforms) and which aren\u2019t (Ari\u00adzona\u2019s im\u00admig\u00adra\u00adtion en\u00adforce\u00adment and \u201can\u00adti\u00adgay\u201d bills).\n\nStep 9: Let it Die!\n\nPre\u00adscrip\u00adtion: Stop the po\u00adlar\u00adiz\u00ading, di\u00advis\u00adive rhet\u00ador\u00adic on so\u00adcial is\u00adsues.\n\nPro\u00adgress: C \u201c\u00a6 Daniels was vil\u00adi\u00adfied for sug\u00adgest\u00ading a \u201ctruce\u201d on so\u00adcial is\u00adsues in 2010, but his ap\u00adproach was vin\u00addic\u00adated in 2012 after Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adans lost win\u00adnable races due to clumsy com\u00adments about rape and abor\u00adtion. 2013 was a struggle, as Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adans walked the fine line between re\u00adspect\u00adfully op\u00adpos\u00ading the Su\u00adpreme Court de\u00adcision on gay mar\u00adriage and of\u00adfend\u00ading people while do\u00ading so. More re\u00adcently, com\u00adments by former Gov. Mike Hucka\u00adbee about con\u00adtra\u00adcep\u00adtion sug\u00adgest some in the GOP will nev\u00ader learn their les\u00adson.

Chalk it up to a war-weary elect\u00ador\u00adate, or on\u00adgo\u00ading de\u00adfi\u00adcit wars, or just re\u00adli\u00adable op\u00adpos\u00adi\u00adtion to any\u00adthing that em\u00adpowers Obama. Whatever the cause, most Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adans de\u00adsire a de\u00adcidedly light\u00ader foot\u00adprint on the glob\u00adal stage. Even some of the most hawk\u00adish Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adans \u2014 those al\u00adways quick to ant\u00adag\u00adon\u00adize Obama\u2019s for\u00adeign policy \u2014 have stopped short of ad\u00advoc\u00adat\u00ading troops on the ground, opt\u00ading in\u00adstead for arm\u00ading rebel groups. That dis\u00adtinc\u00adtion alone speaks to a shift oc\u00adcur\u00adring in\u00adside a party that has de\u00adpend\u00adably pre\u00adscribed mil\u00adit\u00adary in\u00adter\u00adven\u00adtion dur\u00ading mo\u00adments of glob\u00adal tu\u00admult over the past half-cen\u00adtury.
