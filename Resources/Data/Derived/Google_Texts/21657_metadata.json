But the influx of new money and new residents is putting a strain on the city's housing market.\n\nThe city has the highest median rent in the nation, and evictions of longtime residents are skyrocketing.\n\nGround zero for San Francisco's eviction crisis is the Inner Mission District. Until recently, this edgy neighborhood was home to a mix of working-class Latinos, artists and activists.\n\nTom Rapp, an airport building maintenance worker, rents a modest second-story flat that he has called home for 15 years. He says a lot of his neighbors have been evicted over the past couple of years. Then bad news came knocking on his door, too.\n\n\"We received an eviction notice at the end of August,\" he says.\n\n\"But we've gotten like three different ones, right?\" adds his roommate, Patricia Kerman.\n\nKerman, a senior on a fixed income, has lived in this flat for 27 years.\n\nThe two are fighting to stay in their rent-controlled apartment as their landlord tries to evict them under what's known as the Ellis Act. It's a state law that allows an eviction if the landlord wants to pull the building out of the rental market, usually with a plan to sell the units.\n\n\"They found this loophole where they're now able to get people out of their rent-controlled apartments, and it's just becoming an epidemic,\" Rapp says.\n\nRapp's landlord was not available for comment.\n\nA recent city report finds that Ellis Act evictions have increased 170 percent over the past three years. Low- and middle-income tenants are unlikely to find another affordable apartment in San Francisco, where the median monthly rent has risen to about $3,400.\n\nFighting Back\n\nAt the steps of San Francisco City Hall, a small group of tenants and community organizers recently demanded that the city do something to prevent more evictions.\n\nInside City Hall, at a packed hearing of the Board of Supervisors, landlord Andrew Long blamed the evictions on the city's rent-control policies.\n\n\"This has caused rents for long-term tenants to be quite low, which is great for them, but it doesn't keep a building up,\" Long said.\n\nLong said rent control drives small property landlords into the hands of big-money speculators who profit from converting rentals to condos.\n\nBut the hearing was dominated by scores of long-time residents who talked about their fears of getting pushed out of San Francisco.\n\nBeverly Upton, director of the San Francisco Domestic Violence Consortium, is facing eviction from a building where she has lived for 25 years.\n\n\"Once the advocates and the organizers and the artists are gone, who will be left to care about our city?\" she said.\n\nThat's a big concern in San Francisco, where traditionally there's always been a balance between the comfortable and the nonconformists, says former Mayor Art Agnos.\n\n\"The struggle to keep people who make between $60,000 and $150,000 a year is what we're facing in San Francisco. That's who the struggle is for today,\" Agnos says. \"Frankly, it's all but over for the poor in this city.\"\n\nMore Development To Come\n\nThe evictions and the fear they engender come as the city is booming. Construction cranes crowd the downtown horizon. Pricey new restaurants serve the well-heeled tech crowd. Million-dollar condos sell for cash as soon as they come on the market.\n\nSo in a city that takes pride in its quirky diversity, there's a palpable sense that the bohemian days of live and let live are slipping away, Agnos says.\n\n\"We're not saying wealthy people shouldn't live here,\" he says. \"What we're saying is we're losing the balance and the opportunity that has always been the promise of San Francisco.\"\n\nSan Francisco has endured similar periods when its housing supply has been squeezed, like during the last dot-com boom.\n\nAnd each time, Agnos says, the city has become that much less affordable.", "article_metadata": {"Rating": "General", "description": "Another tech boom has brought an influx of money and new residents to San Francisco, and people who have long called the city home are being evicted from their apartments.
