Republicans turn on committee chair\n\nHouse Republicans are going to win seats next week, but there\u2019s talk among lawmakers and top GOP aides that the campaign chief could \u2014 and should \u2014 lose his job.\n\nRep. Greg Walden, the chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee, could face challenges from either Rep. Roger Williams, a Texas Republican, or Rep. Aaron Schock of Illinois. Both have sent signals they\u2019re interested in a potential bid.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nWalden\u2019s detractors say there\u2019s no case to keep the Oregonian around. House Republicans have been consistently outraised by their Democratic counterparts, despite the GOP being in the majority. Their strategy and tactics have been called into question during the final weeks of campaigning. Pockets of the NRCC\u2019s staff are deeply unhappy. And they are likely to fall short of their publicly proclaimed goal of winning nearly a dozen seats; Walden\u2019s \u201cDrive for 245\u201d will have turned out to be nothing but a fundraising ploy.\n\n( POLITICO's 2014 race ratings)\n\nWalden\u2019s many supporters \u2014 including Speaker John Boehner of Ohio \u2014 say the chairman was key in setting up an infrastructure to win the half-dozen to dozen seats Republicans anticipate they will pick up. Boehner\u2019s staff says he\u2019s still behind Walden, although sources on the speaker\u2019s team are keenly aware of the frustration toward the NRCC.\n\n\u201cChairman Walden is working tirelessly on behalf of our candidates. He\u2019s a big reason why we\u2019ve got an opportunity to win a larger House majority this November,\u201d Cory Fritz, Boehner\u2019s top political aide, said.\n\nA number of Republicans have already begun positioning themselves for a post-Walden world \u2014 either by laying the groundwork to challenge him or setting up structures to run if Walden decides to forgo reelection.\n\n( DRIVING THE ELECTION DAY: What to watch in Kentucky)\n\nWilliams, who is one of the party\u2019s fundraisers, has been calling around D.C. during this election season, trying to build support for his candidacy. Schock has spent the past few weeks flying around the country in a private jet \u2014 staff in tow \u2014 to raise money and campaign for his House colleagues. Schock has been talking to lawmakers about a run for the chairmanship but is also interested in a statewide campaign for governor in Illinois.\n\nIf Walden decides against seeking another term, both Reps. Lynn Westmoreland of Georgia and Ann Wagner of Missouri would consider bids.\n\n( Full 2014 election results)\n\nNothing angers the NRCC more than lawmakers mulling post-election leadership races during the campaign season. Andrea Bozek, a spokesman for the NRCC, said, \u201cChairman Walden is fully focused on electing Republican candidates on November 4th.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe is consistently out on the campaign trail helping candidates all across the country and appreciates how many of his colleagues are stepping up to help in very effective and positive ways,\u201d Bozek added.\n\nThe decision about Walden\u2019s future at the NRCC is largely up to Boehner, a strong ally. Boehner is close enough to Walden to nudge him in either direction. The danger for Walden is that lawmakers return to Washington, angry and tired from a bruising election season and want change. Boehner isn\u2019t in danger of losing his job, nor is House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) or Majority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.). Walden could become a casualty.\n\nRegardless of what happens with the NRCC, Walden has a bright future in the House Republican Conference. Next Congress, he will be the sixth-ranking Republican on the House Energy and Commerce Committee, and he could easily be the powerful panel\u2019s next chairman.\n\nIn some ways, even Walden\u2019s detractors know he\u2019s getting a bum rap. House and Senate Democrats have bludgeoned Republicans in fundraising partially because they have a powerful surrogate in President Barack Obama and a robust digital operation.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Greg Walden could face challenges from either Roger Williams or Aaron Schock.", "og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "Greg Walden could face challenges from either Roger Williams or Aaron Schock.", "title": "Republicans turn on committee chair", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2014/10/nrcc-chair-greg-walden-roger-williams-aaron-schock-112289.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2014/10/28/141028_greg_walden_ap_605.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "keywords": "NRCC,Roger Williams,Aaron Schock,Greg Walden", "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/Jakeshermanpolitico"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8dc5\"", "article_summary": "Republicans turn on committee chairHouse Republicans are going to win seats next week, but there\u2019s talk among lawmakers and top GOP aides that the campaign chief could \u2014 and should \u2014 lose his job.\nHouse Republicans have been consistently outraised by their Democratic counterparts, despite the GOP being in the majority.\nBoehner isn\u2019t in danger of losing his job, nor is House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) or Majority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.).\nRegardless of what happens with the NRCC, Walden has a bright future in the House Republican Conference.\nHe\u2019s a big reason why we\u2019ve got an opportunity to win a larger House majority this November,\u201d Cory Fritz, Boehner\u2019s top political aide, said."}
