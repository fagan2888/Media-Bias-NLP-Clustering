In the slugfest for Texas governor, the rich and famous have placed some hefty political bets.

Republican Greg Abbott has a staggering mound of campaign cash on hand — $35.6 million. It’s enough to allow him to control the airwaves until November’s election.

His Democratic rival, Wendy Davis, has $13.1 million in the bank, helped largely by party loyalists, women’s groups and entertainment figures.

Unlike federal campaigns, Texas does not restrict the size of individual donations. Critics of the state’s unlimited system say it means those with deep pockets are trying to buy insider access. Donors dispute that, saying they line up behind the candidates who best represent their values.

Here’s a deeper look at the Abbott-Davis fundraising over the last year:

TOP DONORS, ABBOTT
