A snow emergency remains in effect in the District of Columbia until further notice, says Linda Grant at the Department of Public Works, which she says has nearly 300 plows out on the roads.

In order to salt, de-ice and plow the streets, the city's snow crews need the snow emergency routes clear from parked cars.

You are looking for red and white signs that say snow emergency route. When you see that sign posted then you know you should not park there," Grant says.

The fees for parking in one of these spots can add up: $250 dollars for a ticket, $100 dollars for the towing fee, and a $20 dollars per day storage fee.

During the last storm, authorities handed out a record $180,000 in fines in what was the city's first snow emergency in four years.

Conditions are treacherous

The word in D.C., Maryland, and Virginia is stay off the roads unless travel is absolutely necessary. Roads are hazardous and the plows need room to work. Here is Joan Morris at the Virginia Department of Transportation.

Conditions have been treacherous. They are slowly beginning to improve now that the snow has stopped but the temperatures are so cold we are going to have very slick conditions throughout the night.

Valerie Burnette Edgar at the Maryland State Highway Administration says tomorrow morning could be rough, too.

Depending on how early you start your day there could still be some icy conditions out there.

Lingering effects for travel, power

At Reagan National and Dulles Airports, spokesman Rob Yingling says call your airline before heading to the airport, because there have been hundreds of cancellations today.

"We expect conditions to improve as we go through the afternoon and into the early evening and flight activity to begin to increase," he says.

The city has also warned residents that there may be power outages because of the ice and snow. Residents are urged to call Pepco to report any outages and do not go near any downed wires.

And people should also be mindful of a city law that requires residents to clear their sidewalk of snow within eight daylight hours of the storm ending.

As part of the snow emergency, D.C. taxicabs are allowed to add a $15 surcharge for any rides they give.
