Johnson signed the Food Stamp Act into law on Aug. 31, 1964. The program has been a whipping boy almost ever since, especially from conservatives who call the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP, the contemporary name for food stamps) a costly and demoralizing example of government overreach.\n\nBut SNAP was not an idea first created by liberal do-gooders of the 1960s. Food stamps emerged three decades earlier with active participation of businessmen, the heroes of the exact group of people who want to see the program dissolved today.\n\nThe early Great Depression was marked by a \u201cparadox of poverty amidst plenty.\u201d Massive crop surpluses led to low prices for farmers. At first, President Franklin D. Roosevelt\u2019s administration tried paying farmers to plow under surplus crops and kill livestock. In theory, decreasing the supply would raise farm prices incentivizing farmers to get their crops to market. But the plan was met with outrage from hungry citizens who said they could have put the destroyed \u201csurplus\u201d food to good use.\n\nAfter this failed start, Roosevelt tried another plan. Government purchased excess crops at a set price and distributed them at little or no cost to poor Americans. But this system was also met with criticism, this time from the sellers of food goods. Wholesalers and retailers were upset that government distribution bypassed \u201cthe regular commercial system,\u201d undercutting their profits.\n\nThe Roosevelt administration started the first pilot food stamp program in 1939 to integrate businesses in getting food to the hungry. However, there were concerns about the food stamp program\u2019s success. A newsmagazine at the time reported, \u201cthere was no difficulty in selling the idea to grocers,\u201d but some feared that the \u201creal beneficiaries\u201d wouldn\u2019t cooperate. Unlike the image conjured up today of the poor clamoring for government aid, in the time of perhaps the greatest need in the past century, businesses were more excited about the federal assistance than the hungry individuals who were to benefit.\n\nAnd it turns out businessmen had good reason for their glee; in the first months of the pilot program, grocery receipts were up 15 percent in the dozen \u201cstamp towns.\u201d Conservatives appreciated people \u201cgoing through the regular channels of trade\u201d and not relying on \u201cgovernment machinery\u201d to bring food to people. The program proved to be so successful that it expanded to half of the counties in the nation by 1943. But the conditions that led to the program\u2019s creation, high unemployment and large agricultural surpluses, disappeared in the WWII economy and the pilot program was shelved.", "article_metadata": {"description": "While conservatives love to beat up on the SNAP program, there's an awkward little fact that might horrify them", "author": "Caitlin Rathe", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "While conservatives love to beat up on the SNAP program, there's an awkward little fact that might horrify them", "title": "The right\u2019s food stamp embarrassment: A history lesson for the haters", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/09/01/the_rights_food_stamp_embarrassment_a_history_lesson_for_the_haters/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/09/fdr2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "While conservatives love to beat up on the SNAP program, there's an awkward little fact that might horrify them", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/09/fdr2.jpg", "title": "The right\u2019s food stamp embarrassment: A history lesson for the haters", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "The right\u2019s food stamp embarrassment: A history lesson for the haters", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, American History, Business, Editor's Picks, Farmers, Food Stamps, Franklin Roosevelt, John F.
