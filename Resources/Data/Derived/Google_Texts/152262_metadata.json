REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst/Files\n\n4710592\n\nOffice Depot is standing by its refusal to print 500 anti-Planned Parenthood flyers, because the flyer is \u201cgraphic\u201d and \u201chate material\u201d that persecutes those who support abortion rights, according to a company explanation obtained The Daily Caller News Foundation.\n\nMaria Goldstein, 42, of Illinois requested the flyers Aug. 20, but an employee refused, citing corporate policy. Goldstein said she is being discriminated against because of her religious beliefs, and obtained legal counsel.\n\nIn a letter written by attorney Robert A. Amicone, Office Depot said the refusal had nothing to do with the woman\u2019s religious beliefs, but she disagrees.\n\n\u201cWhen I tell people they\u2019re shocked because this is America,\u201d Goldstein told TheDCNF Thursday. \u201cOffice Depot is trying to silence my freedom of speech and my freedom of religion.\u201d\n\nGoldstein planned to hand them out at her church. The flyers list facts from Planned Parenthood\u2019s annual report and quotes a prayer calling for an end to Planned Parenthood.\n\nThe prayer is where Office Depot has a problem.\n\nThe letter obtained by TheDCNF says that certain language, such as \u201cthe killing of children in the womb\u201d and \u201cthe grisly trade of body parts\u201d as well as referencing the \u201cdeath camps in our midst\u201d is graphic hate speech by Office Depot\u2019s standards.\n\nOffice Depot policy \u201cprohibits the copying of \u2018graphic material,\u2019 which can include descriptions of dead or dismembered bodies,\u201d Amicone wrote. Company policy also \u201cprohibits the copying of \u201chate material\u201d that advocates for the persecution of groups of people, regardless of the reason.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo be clear, Office Depot\u2019s position is that the above-quoted language falls within the definition of \u2018graphic material\u2019 and/or \u2018hate material,\u2019 making the refusal to print the flyer appropriate,\u201d the attorney wrote.\n\nGoldstein has teamed up with the religious liberty group the Thomas More Society. They told TheDCNF they will likely file a legal complaint if Office Depot does not comply.\n\nRead the full letter here:\n\nOffice Depot Response\n\nRead the flyer here:\n\nPlanned Parenthood Fact Sheet and Prayer by Daily Caller News Foundation\n\nFollow Casey on Twitter and like him on Facebook\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
