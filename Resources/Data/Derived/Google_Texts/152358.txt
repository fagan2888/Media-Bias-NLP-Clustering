The floors of the Frank Cochran Center were crawling Saturday evening, with people from all over, during the 32nd annual crawfish boil hosted by The Meridian Symphony League.

The crawfish boil goes to raise money to support the Meridian Symphony Orchestra throughout the year. League President Michelle Mayer, says the event has consistently grown over the year. Just this year, the league had to purchase an additional 1500 pounds of crawfish to accommodate the extra hundreds of tickets that were sold.

"Our event is growing," Mayer said. "We have almost doubled in size this year. Last year we ordered 8500 pounds of crawfish and this year we have ordered 10,000 pounds of crawfish. We sold at least over 500 more tickets this year than last."

The league was out of all 10,000 pounds of crawfish, just two hours after the event started. To put how much it has grown in perspective, just two years ago, the crawfish boil only had 7000 pounds of crawfish.
