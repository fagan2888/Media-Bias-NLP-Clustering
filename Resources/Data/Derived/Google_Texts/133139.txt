The AARP Foundation will be offering free tax preparation assistance beginning Feb. 2 for Hawai‘i taxpayers with low to moderate incomes. The program will be available at four locations on Maui. You do not need to be an AARP member or retiree to access the service.

New tax rules under the Affordable Care Act are requiring additional documentation for some taxpayers this year, including family health insurance information with details about marketplace/exchange purchases, and healthcare exemptions. Taxpayers with Medicare or Medicare Advantage do not need to provide additional information.

The following locations on Maui will offer the free service:

AARP’s aid program is the largest free tax assistance service in the nation, now in its 48th year. Last year, tax-aide volunteers in Hawai‘i helped over 16,000 people file federal and state returns, claiming over $5.5 million in refunds and $1.2 million in earned income credits for 2014. The program is offered at roughly 40 sites statewide including senior centers, libraries and other locations.

Tax-aide volunteers are trained and IRS-certified every year to ensure they are up-to-date on changes to the US tax code.

“Tax-aide volunteers give a big boost to both individuals and our local economy by helping low- and moderate-income residents with their taxes,” said Gerry Silva, AARP Hawai‘i State president. “They also help many low-income workers who might otherwise fail to file for earned income tax credits.”
