It\u2019s unclear what AQAP\u2019s actual intentions are with the airport, but it does seem to have been relatively low priority in their targets around Mukalla.\n\nEarlier this month Saudi Arabia began attacking the Shi\u2019ite Houthis in Yemen. This was nominally to restore the \u201clegitimate\u201d government of former President Hadi, who resigned in January. Though the Saudis have air-dropped arms to Hadi\u2019s remaining loyalists, they appear too few to make serious inroads in the country, and the war on the Houthis is instead benefiting AQAP as the only other major power in the country.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 Antiwar.com 2015", "article_metadata": {"description": "Local tribes hope Al-Qaeda will give airport to them.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "AUTHOR": "Jason Ditz | Antiwar.com", "og": {"site_name": "MintPress News", "description": "Local tribes hope Al-Qaeda will give airport to them.", "title": "Al-Qaeda Captures Yemen Airport, Oil Terminal", "url": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/al-qaeda-captures-yemen-airport-oil-terminal/204533/", "image": "https://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Mideast-Yemen_Muha2.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-04-17T16:29:40-05:00", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Local tribes hope Al-Qaeda will give airport to them.", "title": "Al-Qaeda Captures Yemen Airport, Oil Terminal", "image": "https://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Mideast-Yemen_Muha2.jpg", "creator": "@MintPressNews", "site": "@MintPressNews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"admins": 100003161352196}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/MintpressNewsMPN", "section": "Daily Digest", "tag": "Yemen", "published_time": "2015-04-18T05:00:44-05:00", "modified_time": "2015-04-17T16:29:40-05:00"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1796\"", "article_summary": "Al-Qaeda Captures Yemen Airport, Oil TerminalLocal tribes hope AQAP will give airport to them.\nEarlier this month Saudi Arabia began attacking the Shi\u2019ite Houthis in Yemen.\nSmoke rises after a Saudi-led airstrike on Sanaa, Yemen, Friday, April 17, 2015.\nIt\u2019s unclear what AQAP\u2019s actual intentions are with the airport, but it does seem to have been relatively low priority in their targets around Mukalla.\nHaving taking the city of Mukalla earlier this month, freeing over 300 prisoners, AQAP has now consolidated its position through the rest of the immediate vicinity, capturing the major provincial airport as well as a valuable oil terminal."}
