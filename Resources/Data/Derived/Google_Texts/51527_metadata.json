Paul Ryan, R-Wis., to become the next House speaker.\n\nThe Daily Signal previously reported that the Freedom Caucus lacked the number of votes required to formally endorse Ryan for speaker, but a supermajority of its members have granted him their support.\n\nOn Fox News Sunday, host Chris Wallace asked Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, \u201cYou were going to demand all kinds of assurances from Ryan about changing House rules, almost none of which you got, so I guess the question is, why are you supporting Paul Ryan?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe do have a commitment from Paul to work on changing the rules, and we may get some of those changed before the vote this coming Wednesday and Thursday,\u201d Jordan said. \u201cSo we think that\u2019s a good step.\u201d\n\nJordan said that Ryan \u201chas the kind of vision and is the kind of messenger that our party needs to accomplish the things we told the voters we\u2019re going to accomplish.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t quite get the endorsement threshold that he needed from our group, but our members said, a supermajority of our members said, we think Paul Ryan is the right guy at the right time to lead our conference,\u201d Jordan said.\n\nWallace asked Jordan if the group will retaliate against Ryan if he is \u201cinsufficiently hard-line.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to work with him, and we think we can come together as a group,\u201d Jordan replied.\n\nJordan said that Ryan has a \u201cbig, bold agenda and vision\u201d that he\u2019s looking forward to passing in the House and sending to the Senate.\n\nRep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C., another member of the House Freedom Caucus, told Sunday Morning Futures host Maria Bartiromo said that there is \u201cgreat respect\u201d among his colleagues for both Ryan and Rep. Daniel Webster, R-Fla., who is also running for speaker.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not as much about the person as it is the process,\u201d Meadows said. \u201cWe want to make sure that Washington, D.C. works for the millions of American citizens who believe that we don\u2019t know how to govern.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt certainly is looking like we\u2019ll have a Speaker Ryan,\u201d Meadows continued.\n\nMeadows called Ryan\u2019s request to change a House procedure known as \u201cthe motion to vacate the chair\u201d a \u201cnon-starter.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see us changing that except to perhaps make it a more open process within our conference, so there are no surprises,\u201d Meadows said. \u201cChairman Ryan is working with us to see how we can address that particular issue.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s more that we agree on than divides us,\u201d Meadows added.\n\nMike Needham, the CEO of Heritage Action, said on \u201cFox News Sunday that if Ryan wants to make changes, \u201che\u2019ll have very strong support.\u201d If \u201cit\u2019s going to be more of the same,\u201d then he won\u2019t.\n\n\u201cPeople are right to be skeptical of Paul Ryan,\u201d Needham said. \u201cThis is a party that since 2010, has done very little to unite ourselves around big, bold ideas, to unite ourselves around a conservative reform agenda, and has looked down the nose at Republican voters. I think Paul Ryan is somebody who could change that.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think he wants to unite the party around big, bold ideas,\u201d Needham added.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Freedom Caucus lacked the number of votes required to formally endorse Ryan for speaker, but a majority of its members have granted him their support.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The Freedom Caucus lacked the number of votes required to formally endorse Ryan for speaker, but a majority of its members have granted him their support.", "title": "Two Members of House Freedom Caucus Explain Why Majority of Group Supports Paul Ryan for Speaker", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/151025_housefreedom_Scanlon.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-10-25T23:45:31+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1NuvRRp"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The Freedom Caucus lacked the number of votes required to formally endorse Ryan for speaker, but a majority of its members have granted him their support.", "title": "Two Members of House Freedom Caucus Explain Why Majority of Group Supports Paul Ryan for Speaker", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/151025_housefreedom_Scanlon.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Politics", "tag": "House of Representatives", "published_time": "2015-10-25T17:44:02+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-10-25T23:45:31+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Paul Ryan, House Freedom Caucus, Daniel Webster, Jim Jordan, Mark Meadows, Fox News Sunday, Sunday Morning Futures, House speaker, speaker of the House"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda924\"", "article_summary": "On Sunday, two members of the House Freedom Caucus explained the group\u2019s majority support for Rep.
