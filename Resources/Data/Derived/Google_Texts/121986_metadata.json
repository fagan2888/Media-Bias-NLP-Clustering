Wells\u2013style vision of a technocratic elite as a Randian utopia. (For those who haven't seen the movie: The \"forces of mediocrity\" that we are told were holding back those \"best and brightest\" include not just bureaucracy but commerce.) And it's very odd to say that Bird \"pines for worlds where incredible people can be free to do incredible things, and to hell with everyone else,\" given the actual plot of the film, in which (SPOILER ALERT) the villain knows that the world is coming to an end but is unconcerned because his little community will survive. There's no kinda-sorta about his villainy: The heroes want a Tomorrowland devoted to fixing the world, not escaping it.\n\nI haven't actually read Atlas Shrugged, but I'm pretty sure it isn't a story about a bunch of scientists who retreat to a gulch so they can avoid market pressures and plot to save the planet. If I'm wrong about that, feel free to correct me in the comments.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "Not an Objectivist movie.
