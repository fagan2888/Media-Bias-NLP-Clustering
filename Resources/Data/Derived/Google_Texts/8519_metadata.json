That\u2019s 4 million fewer than it projected just last year.\n\nThe Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, meanwhile, recently revealed that one in four people who signed up for coverage at the beginning of 2015 had dropped it by year\u2019s end.\n\nThe rapid decline in both actual and expected coverage spells trouble for the viability of Obamacare\u2019s exchanges. The question is no longer if they\u2019ll collapse but when.\n\nThe White House has tried to stay positive. This year\u2019s open enrollment period yielded 12 million enrollees, up 2.6 percent from last year. That prompted Kevin Counihan, the CEO of HeathCare.gov, to boast, \u201cWe knocked the lights out this year.\u201d\n\nHis celebration may be premature. If last year\u2019s 25 percent attrition rate holds true again this year, total enrollment could be just 9.5 million \u2013 barely 700,000 more people than 2015.\n\nAnd there\u2019s good reason to believe that this year\u2019s attrition rate will be even higher.\n\nPremiums have climbed significantly this year. Exchange shoppers in 17 states are facing average premium increases of 20 percent or more in 2016. According to Health and Human Services, the average monthly premium for all plans purchased on HealthCare.gov is $408 \u2013 a 9 percent increase over last year.\n\nDeductibles have also climbed steadily. According to the online insurance marketplace HealthPocket, the average deductible for a silver plan \u2013 the most popular option on the exchanges \u2013 was $3,117 for individuals and $6,480 for families. Bronze plans, which often come with the lowest premiums, saw average deductibles reach $5,731 and $11,601 for the same groups.\n\nThose rising costs may cause many enrollees to drop their coverage as the year goes on. Even those who can afford higher premiums may decide they\u2019re not worth it if they\u2019ll still have to pay out large amounts to meet their deductible.\n\nThe data seem to show that many young people are making just that calculation. Americans ages 18 to 34 comprised just 28 percent of enrollees this year \u2013 well below the 38 percent goal.\n\nThe reluctance of young Americans to enroll in exchange plans is a problem. The law needs premiums from young, generally healthy Americans to subsidize coverage for older patients, who generally need more care and thus are costlier to insure.\n\nObamacare\u2019s individual mandate was supposed to make sure that the exchange pool had plenty of young people. Under the law, Americans who fail to sign up this year face fines of $695 or 2.5 percent of their income, whichever is greater.\n\nFor many young people, this one-time fee is much lower than the cost of coverage, which can run thousands of dollars a year.\n\nThe lack of young people in the exchanges is even more problematic because the rest of the exchange pool has turned out to be sicker than insurers expected.\n\nBlue Cross Blue Shield recently analyzed its members\u2019 claims data over the past two years. Those who enrolled in exchange plans had higher rates of illnesses like hypertension, diabetes and Hepatitis C than did folks with coverage pre-Obamacare.\n\nTo compensate, insurers may be forced to hike premiums even higher \u2013 or to leave the exchanges because of unsustainable losses.\n\nInsurers have started instituting \u201cnarrow\u201d networks \u2013 that is, limiting the number of doctors and hospitals that a given policy will cover \u2013 as part of their effort to control costs. In 2015, four out of 10 exchange plans granted consumers access to barely a quarter of local doctors. And according to a new report from McKinsey, the percentage of Americans with access to only narrow provider networks tripled from 2015 to 2016.\n\nThis year\u2019s exchange enrollment figures are nothing to brag about. If the Obama administration disagrees, they can take it up with their colleagues elsewhere in the federal government.\n\nSally C. Pipes is president, CEO, and Thomas W.
