It\u2019s the same amount that fell in Granby, 60 miles northwest.\n\nOfficially, the total for Denver was only about 3 inches, as recorded at Denver International Airport.\n\nThe mountains saw considerably more snow south of Granby \u2014 beginning at Breckenridge, where totals surpassed 30 inches. Three feet of snow in Monarch and Silverton were reported to the National Weather Service and Colorado Ski Country USA.\n\nKari Bowen, a meteorologist with the Weather Service in Boulder, said northeastern Colorado got the brunt of the storm when it first arrived on Thursday.\n\nAn upslope in Weld, Morgan, Washington and Yuma counties had yielded anywhere from 5 to 10 inches before the weekend, Bowen said. Yuma got as much as 13 inches by Saturday morning.\n\nThe snow, which tapered off in Denver on Saturday, could come back in light flurries for a week.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an unsettled pattern. There\u2019s a lot going on,\u201d Bowen said. \u201cIt\u2019s not your typical ridge that moves in and settles down in a couple of days.\u201d\n\nA 10 percent to 30 percent chance of precipitation will persist throughout the week, Bowen said, \u201cdepending on what\u2019s happening in the atmosphere.\u201d\n\nAlison Noon: 303-954-1223, anoon@denverpost.com or twitter.com/alisonnoon\n\nTotal inches of snow in colorado high country \u2014 last 48 hours\n\nMonarch: 36\n\nSilverton: 36\n\nAspen Mountain: 33\n\nBreckenridge: 32\n\nAspen Highlands: 28\n\nCrested Butte: 28\n\nSnowmass: 28\n\nButtermilk: 27\n\nVail: 27\n\nLeadville: 24\n\nCopper Mountain: 23\n\nTelluride: 23\n\nWolf Creek: 22\n\nDurango: 18\n\nWinter Park: 18\n\nEldora: 17\n\nLoveland: 16.5\n\nArapahoe Basin: 16\n\nGlenwood Springs: 12\n\nHowelsen: 11\n\nPowderhorn: 10\n\nSteamboat: 10\n\nGranby: 9\n\nSource: Colorado Ski Country USA, National Weather Service", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "3 feet of snow pile up in central mountains, 9 inches in areas near Denver", "title": "3 feet of snow pile up in central mountains, 9 inches in areas near Denver", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/02/01/3-feet-of-snow-pile-up-in-central-mountains-9-inches-in-areas-near-denver/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140201__weather-snow-skiingp1.jpg", "height": 245}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140201__weather-snow-skiingp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-02-01T10:18:50+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T13:58:51+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe24da\"", "article_summary": "Three feet of snow in Monarch and Silverton were reported to the National Weather Service and Colorado Ski Country USA.\nWith the arrival of 3 additional inches overnight Friday, parts of Adams, Arapahoe and Jefferson counties received as much as 9 inches of snow.\nThe snow that fell Thursday through Saturday afternoon accumulated as many inches in some suburbs near Denver as it did in the northern high country.\nOfficially, the total for Denver was only about 3 inches, as recorded at Denver International Airport.\nThe mountains saw considerably more snow south of Granby \u2014 beginning at Breckenridge, where totals surpassed 30 inches."}
