He added that he blames Sen. Harry Reid (D-NV) who filibustered, \u201call but one appropriations bill\u201d and also his caucus who, \u201cseized up in the middle of the summer, unable to pass any appropriations bills because of some poison pill amendments.\u201d\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nRyan was asked why $1.6 billion was allocated to the refugee program, especially considering there was support from dozens of Republican members of Congress for a proposal introduced by Rep. Brian Babin (R-TX) that would temporarily halt the refugee program. Despite the broad support, Ryan decided to fund President Obama\u2019s refugee program, which includes Syrian refugees. He argued that:\n\n$1.6 billion is not simply for Syrian refugees. It\u2019s for the entire refugee program. You remember the unaccompanied children that got dumped onto the border from Honduras and El Salvador? We had to go do emergency legislation\u2026and put new resources on the border in anticipation of that. Well, there\u2019s a fear that could happen again, so that\u2019s what this money is for, to prevent and prepare for any chance that we might have a whole new raft of unaccompanied children getting put on the border.\n\nRyan also discussed what he hopes to accomplish in 2016, saying that Americans are, \u201d going to see us put a bill on the president\u2019s desk going after ObamaCare and Planned Parenthood.\u201d\n\nHe added that Americans will \u201csee a return to regular order, where men and women in Congress can bring their bills to the floor, make their amendments in order, and we will run Congress the way the Founders intended it to be run.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI) told radio host Bill Bennett that he hates Omnibus bills, but he passed a $1 trillion omnibus last week anyway.", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI) told radio host Bill Bennett that he hates Omnibus bills, but he passed a $1 trillion omnibus last week anyway.", "title": "Paul Ryan: 'I Hate Omnibus Bill' But I Did It Anyway", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/12/Paul-Ryan-I-Hate-the-Bill-AP-PhotoJ.-Scott-Applewhite.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/12/22/paul-ryan-hate-omnibus-bill-anyway/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI) told radio host Bill Bennett that he hates Omnibus bills, but he passed a $1 trillion omnibus last week anyway.", "title": "Paul Ryan: 'I Hate Omnibus Bill' But I Did It Anyway", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/12/Paul-Ryan-I-Hate-the-Bill-AP-PhotoJ.-Scott-Applewhite.jpg", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true", "app_id": 1243316582352556}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Bill Bennett, omnibus, Paul Ryan,Big Government, Economics, Immigration,Paul Ryan", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Big Government", "tag": "Paul Ryan", "published_time": "2015-12-22T09:57:00-07:00", "categories": "Big Government,Immigration,Economics"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "\u201cI hate omnibus bills and I don\u2019t like doing these last-second bills,\u201d Ryan said.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERHouse Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI) told radio host Bill Bennett that he hates Omnibus bills, but he passed a $1 trillion omnibus last week anyway.\nDespite the broad support, Ryan decided to fund President Obama\u2019s refugee program, which includes Syrian refugees.\nIt\u2019s for the entire refugee program.\nYou remember the unaccompanied children that got dumped onto the border from Honduras and El Salvador?"}
