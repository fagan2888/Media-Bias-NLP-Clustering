The pro-Affordable Care Act organization hopes to recruit 2,000 counselors.\n\nEnroll America is working with UHCAN (Universal Health Care Action Network) to recruit and train volunteer counselors in Cleveland. An informational event will be held from 9 to 10:30 a.m. Friday at the Get Covered America's northeast Ohio office, 13437 Cedar Rd., Cleveland Heights. Preregistration is suggested at Get Covered America's web site, getcoveredamerica.org/events but people can also show up. For information, call Chris at (614) 636-0385.\n\nThose who are unable to attend Friday's session can log into a make-up webinar at 6:30 p.m. Wednesday, Oct. 29. Go to Get Covered America's web site for information.\n\nThe schedule for group training sessions and individual online training will be provided at a later date.\n\nAccording to data from Enroll America, people who received in-person assistance were more than twice as likely to successfully complete enrollment as those who attempted to enroll online without help.\n\nOhio has received less money per uninsured resident than most states to help with the sign-up efforts. Because of that, more volunteer certified application counselors are being recruited to add to the ranks of navigators (whose salaries are covered by federal grants) and other counselors. Certified application counselors are affiliated with hospitals, community health centers, social service agencies and other non-profit, non-governmental organizations.\n\nOther recruitment events in Ohio included a session in Columbus on Wednesday and a session in Cincinnati on Thursday.\n\nEnroll America also is joining with the Ohio Association of Foodbanks to implement an online scheduling tool that will allow people to schedule appointments with in-person assisters in their area.", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "aca,certified-application-counselor,obamacare", "title": "Volunteers sought to help people sign up for health insurance during next Obamacare sign-up period", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Volunteers sought to help people sign up for health insurance during next Obamacare sign-up period\", \"link\": \"http://www.cleveland.com/healthfit/index.ssf/2014/10/volunteers_sought_to_help_peop.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://imgick.cleveland.com/home/cleve-media/width620/img/health_impact/photo/get-covered-america-tour-stops-at-tri-c-west-to-promote-the-upcoming-deadline-to-sign-up-for-obamacare-621f87b40f8c7109.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"14265875\", \"pub_date\": \"2014-10-23T10:09:23Z\", \"author\": \"Angela Townsend, The Plain Dealer\", \"tags\": [\"@mobile\",\"aca\",\"certified-application-counselor\",\"obamacare\"] }", "twitter": {"image": "http://media.cleveland.com/health_impact/photo/16148427-thumb_square_large.jpg", "creator": "@atownzz", "description": "The next open enrollment period to sign up for insurance begins Nov. 15.", "card": "summary", "site": "@clevelanddotcom"}, "article_date_updated": "Thursday, October 23, 2014,  6:09 AM", "parsely-metadata": "{\"image_url\": \"http://media.cleveland.com/health_impact/photo/get-covered-america-tour-stops-at-tri-c-west-to-promote-the-upcoming-deadline-to-sign-up-for-obamacare-621f87b40f8c7109.jpg\", \"author_name\": \"atownsen\", \"author_nickname\": \"Angela Townsend, The Plain Dealer\", \"author_id\": \"5587\", \"source_blog_name\": \"Health and Fitness\", \"source_blog_url\": \"http://www.cleveland.com/healthfit/index.ssf/\", \"sponsored_content\": \"0\" }", "og": {"site_name": "cleveland.com", "description": "The next open enrollment period to sign up for insurance begins Nov. 15.", "title": "Volunteers sought to help people sign up for health insurance during next Obamacare sign-up period", "url": "http://www.cleveland.com/healthfit/index.ssf/2014/10/volunteers_sought_to_help_peop.html", "image": "http://media.cleveland.com/design/alpha/img/logo_cleve.gif", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "cleveland.com", "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Thursday, October 23, 2014,  6:00 AM", "article_author": "Angela Townsend, The Plain Dealer", "Description": "The next open enrollment period to sign up for insurance begins Nov. 15."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8883\"", "article_summary": "The schedule for group training sessions and individual online training will be provided at a later date.\nEnroll America is working with UHCAN (Universal Health Care Action Network) to recruit and train volunteer counselors in Cleveland.\nAccording to data from Enroll America, people who received in-person assistance were more than twice as likely to successfully complete enrollment as those who attempted to enroll online without help.\nCertified application counselors are affiliated with hospitals, community health centers, social service agencies and other non-profit, non-governmental organizations.\nOther recruitment events in Ohio included a session in Columbus on Wednesday and a session in Cincinnati on Thursday."}
