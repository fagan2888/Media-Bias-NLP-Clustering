MILWAUKEE (AP) — Taken in by the Brewers, stray dog Hank is safe at his new home.

The team’s celebrity canine arrived in Milwaukee on Sunday on a plane filled with team sponsors and employees returning from Arizona.

Hank, thought to be a bichon frise mix, walked on to the Brewers’ spring training complex in Phoenix last month. Members of the organization took turns taking care of Hank while they looked for the owner.

No one came forward, so the family of a team executive in Milwaukee will take in Hank for good.

Hank was treated like a celebrity upon arriving in Milwaukee. Mayor Tom Barrett joked the dog had turned into a “pup-culture icon.”

The dog is making its Miller Park debut Tuesday when official Hank attire is unveiled.
