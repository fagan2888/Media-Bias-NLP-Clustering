The harmful effects of his policies, as well as his many scandals, must be ignored or covered up with misleading statistics and deceitful reporting that preserve his radical, left-wing legacy, and even make it sound mainstream.\n\nMembers of the media often follow the lead of the Times in choosing the angles for their own reporting. And, as we noted last year, Paul Krugman\u2019s columns for that paper, while opinion pieces, reflect the Times\u2019 underlying perspective and political agenda.\n\nJust as last summer Krugman triumphantly announced that 2014 would go down in history as \u201cas one of those years when America took a major turn in the right direction,\u201d his August 10 column seeks to demonstrate how Republican presidential candidates are unable to confront Obama\u2019s \u201cfailure to fail,\u201d despite all the dire conservative warnings. In other words, Krugman has once again penned a defense of President Obama\u2019s agenda, particularly Obamacare and America\u2019s economic growth.\n\n\u201cTalk to right-wingers, and they will inevitably assert that it [Obamacare] has been a disaster,\u201d he claims. \u201cBut ask exactly what form this disaster has taken, and at best you get unverified anecdotes about rate hikes and declining quality.\u201d\n\nThose \u201cunverified anecdotes\u201d were considered so credible that Krugman\u2019s own paper dedicated a front-page article last October to the crisis facing Americans who could no longer pay for their rising deductibles and their medical expenses under Obamacare: \u201cAbout 7.3 million Americans are enrolled in private coverage through the Affordable Care Act marketplaces,\u201d wrote the Times, \u201cand more than 80 percent qualified for federal subsidies to help with the cost of their monthly premiums. But many are still on the hook for deductibles that can top $5,000 for individuals and $10,000 for families\u2014the trade-off, insurers say, for keeping premiums for the marketplace plans relatively low.\u201d\n\nBut the Times\u2019 reporting on this issue was a short-term divergence from its, and other papers,\u2019 long-term campaign to demonstrate that Obamacare has been successful regardless of the evidence demonstrating that it has damaged Americans\u2019 ability to pay for their health care. Any objective analysis\u2014one not secretly swayed by hidden political and familial connections\u2014would conclude that Obamacare has been an abject failure marked by rising costs and declining care.\n\n\u201cObamacare was supposed to be a job-killer\u2026\u201d writes Krugman, criticizing Republican presidential candidate Marco Rubio (R-FL). Krugman writes that \u201cin the year and a half since Obamacare went fully into effect, the U.S. economy has added an average of 237,000 private-sector jobs per month\u201d and labels this a better performance than any \u201csince the 1990s,\u201d better even when compared with President Ronald Reagan\u2019s term in office.\n\n\u201cMany employers cut workers\u2019 hours to avoid the Affordable Care Act\u2019s mandate to provide health insurance to anyone working 30 hours a week or more,\u201d wrote Mortimer Zuckerman for The Wall Street Journal last year. \u201cThe unintended consequence of President Obama\u2019s \u2018signature legislation\u2019? Fewer full-time workers. In many cases two people are working the same number of hours that one had previously worked.\u201d\n\nZuckerman broke down the employment figures from the previous month, another one of those months with an increase of about a quarter million people in private-sector jobs: \u201cFull-time jobs last month plunged by 523,000, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. What has increased are part-time jobs. They soared by about 800,000 to more than 28 million. Just think of all those Americans working part time, no doubt glad to have the work but also contending with lower pay, diminished benefits and little job security.\u201d That is the America that Obamacare and the Obama economy are creating.\n\nThe Hill\u2019s Vicki Needham reported on August 7 that \u201cwage growth remains stagnant even as the labor market makes gains.\u201d Despite this, Needham describes the current \u201cimproving\u201d economy as a \u201cboon for President Obama.\u201d\n\nThis is an economic shell game, pure and simple. As a Princeton economics professor, and former Enron consultant, Krugman must know better. He does acknowledge that there are \u201cmany reasons to qualify\u201d the low unemployment rate, \u201cnotably the fact that measured unemployment is low in part because of a decline in the percentage of Americans in the labor force.\u201d But that huge understatement was it as far as balance goes.\n\nThe labor participation rate is actually stuck at around 62.6 percent, comparable to the 1970s. That\u2019s more than three percent less labor participation by Americans than there was in January 2009 when President Obama took office, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. That translates to approximately 90 million people, depending on how you count them, who either aren\u2019t working or aren\u2019t looking for work.\n\nWhen such inconvenient facts don\u2019t provide support for Obamacare, amnesty, or additional climate change regulations in the service of Obama\u2019s progressive agenda, journalists try to divert the public\u2019s attention by manufacturing supportive headlines.\n\nCNN reported on August 7 that African Americans now have an unemployment rate below 10 percent, at 9.1 percent as of this July, with the headline, \u201cBlack unemployment rate falls to lowest in 7 years.\u201d This is \u201cespecially encouraging\u201d because \u201cunemployment for African-Americans was 11.4% last July,\u201d it reports.\n\nGlassdoor Chief Economist Andrew Chamberlain tells CNN Money that \u201cThe unemployment rate can fall for good reasons\u2014people find jobs\u2014or bad reasons like people who couldn\u2019t find jobs leave the labor force.\u201d\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, I think [this month] it\u2019s more being driven by people leaving the labor market,\u201d he continued.\n\nYet, despite Chamberlain\u2019s comments, the article maintains that \u201cexperts say the trend over the past year is positive.\u201d\n\nBut according to the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute, 51 percent of black high school graduates between the age of 17 and 20 are underemployed, meaning unemployed or working part time, but wanting to work full time.\n\nHowever, the real dereliction of duty by the mainstream media has been with the ongoing underreported or misreported stories that they don\u2019t dare to touch. From the FAA hiring scandal, to the IRS scandal, to Fast & Furious and the Benghazi scandals, the media run faster and harder every day to dream up new stories about trivial events to fill their papers with anything\u2014any diversion that doesn\u2019t implicate the Obama administration for its widespread and growing malfeasance. This week the diversion is Donald Trump vs. Fox News\u2019 Megyn Kelly, after their debate confrontation last Thursday night, plus the subsequent comments Trump made on CNN.\n\nReporters won\u2019t admit that Hillary Clinton\u2019s ongoing email scandal involving the misuse of classified information, lies, and stonewalling, is, in fact, a State Department scandal. After all, the State Department knew about then-Secretary of State Clinton\u2019s use of private email, and allowed her to do all of her business on a private email server, leaving it vulnerable to sophisticated hackers such as those operating in China, Russia, and North Korea. NBC News reported on Monday that \u201cChina\u2019s cyber spies have accessed the private emails of \u2018many\u2019 top Obama administration officials, according to a senior U.S. intelligence official and a top secret document obtained by NBC News, and have been doing so since at least April 2010.\u201d\n\nPresident Obama has admitted that he exchanged emails with Secretary Clinton at her private address, but still maintains that he didn\u2019t know \u201cthe details\u201d about her private server, or that she did all of her government business on it. He had originally said he learned about Hillary\u2019s \u201cprivate email address use through recent news reports, [at] \u2018the same time everybody else learned it.\u2019\u201d\n\nThat was the same lie he initially told about how he learned about the IRS targeting of conservative groups.\n\nDavid Axelrod, the former senior advisor to President Obama, said back in February, during his book tour, \u201cAnd I\u2019m proud of the fact that, basically, you\u2019ve had an administration that\u2019s been in place for six years in which there hasn\u2019t been a major scandal.\u201d\n\nThe only reason these scandals aren\u2019t labeled as such can be blamed on a Krugman-like syndrome: an absolute refusal by these reporters to connect the dots from debacles such as Fast & Furious and the Benghazi scandals back to their real source, the Obama White House. Responsibility for these scandals flows from the top down. Since the Justice Department refuses to seriously investigate these scandals, it is left up to Congress and the media, neither of which have the authority to indict anyone, nor, apparently, the appetite or guts to pursue them.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Accuracy In Media", "description": "Paul Krugman\u2019s columns for that paper, while opinion pieces, reflect the Times\u2019 underlying perspective and political agenda.", "title": "Krugman and the Times Still Spinning Obama\u2019s Legacy", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://www.aim.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/krugman_obama.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-08-11T03:08:29+00:00", "url": "http://www.aim.org/aim-column/krugman-and-the-times-still-spinning-obamas-legacy/", "type": "article"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/AccuracyInMedia/", "section": "AIM Column", "published_time": "2015-08-11T03:08:29+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-08-11T03:08:29+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "Paul Krugman\u2019s columns for that paper, while opinion pieces, reflect the Times\u2019 underlying perspective and political agenda.", "title": "Krugman and the Times Still Spinning Obama\u2019s Legacy", "url": "http://www.aim.org/aim-column/krugman-and-the-times-still-spinning-obamas-legacy/", "image": "http://www.aim.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/krugman_obama.jpg", "site": "@AccuracyInMedia", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdfa26\"", "article_summary": "In other words, Krugman has once again penned a defense of President Obama\u2019s agenda, particularly Obamacare and America\u2019s economic growth.\nMembers of the media often follow the lead of the Times in choosing the angles for their own reporting.\nAnd, as we noted last year, Paul Krugman\u2019s columns for that paper, while opinion pieces, reflect the Times\u2019 underlying perspective and political agenda.\nIn the view of The New York Times and other beacons of the liberal media, President Barack Obama\u2019s policies are a resounding success and he rarely makes a misstep.\n\u201cObamacare was supposed to be a job-killer\u2026\u201d writes Krugman, criticizing Republican presidential candidate Marco Rubio (R-FL)."}
