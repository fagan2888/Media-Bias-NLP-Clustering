(Photo: Hafeez Commbs)\n\nThe government says a New Jersey music producer who once worked with stars including Kenny G and Whitney Houston should spend over two decades in prison for swindling investors with a multimillion-dollar Ponzi scheme.\n\nProsecutors filed papers Monday in Manhattan federal court prior to the sentencing of Charles Huggins later this month. The government said the 68-year-old Edgewater, New Jersey resident should face between 22 years and 27 years in prison after his October conviction on fraud and conspiracy charges.\n\nLawyers for Huggins say he is ailing and functionally illiterate. They say he should face no more than six years in prison at sentencing later this month.\n\nThe lawyers included a video from Huggins\u2019 ex-wife \u2014 soul singer Melba Moore \u2014 among their court submissions.\n\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
