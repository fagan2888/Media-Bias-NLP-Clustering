But I like it. Most people know the first deception in the triumvirate of deceit: \u201cIf you like your health insurance you can keep it, period.\u201d The second leg in the tripod of deception was \u201cIf you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor.\u201d\n\nBut the third plank in the triad of disinformation hasn\u2019t gotten much attention: Obamacare will save you, me, and the country a lot of money. This lie took several forms.\n\nFirst, Obama promised on numerous occasions that the average family of four will save $2,500 a year in premiums. Where did that number come from? Three Harvard economists wrote a memo in 2007 in which they claimed that then-Senator Obama\u2019s health-care plan would reduce national health-care spending by $200 billion. Then, according to the New York Times, the authors \u201cdivided [$200 billion] by the country\u2019s population, multiplied for a family of four, and rounded down slightly to a number that was easy to grasp: $2,500.\u201d\n\nIn September, the Obama administration\u2019s Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services used far more rigorous methods to predict that Obamacare would increase national health-care spending by $621 billion. Using Obama\u2019s own math, that would mean \u2014 according to Chris Conover, an economist at the American Enterprise Institute and Duke University \u2014 each family of four in America will spend an additional $7,450 thanks to Obamacare.\n\nOf course, that methodology is still bogus. But it\u2019s probably closer to the truth.\n\nThe president and his allies also insisted that all of Obamacare\u2019s \u201cfree\u201d preventative care would save the country vast amounts of money. As Obama put it in 2012: \u201cAs part of the health-care reform law that I signed last year, all insurance plans are required to cover preventive care at no cost. That means free check-ups, free mammograms, immunizations, and other basic services. We fought for this because it saves lives and it saves money \u2014 for families, for businesses, for government, for everybody.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s not true either. First of all, you\u2019d think people would understand that there is no such thing as \u201cat no cost.\u201d You are paying for \u201cfree\u201d mammograms, blood tests, and the rest, even if you don\u2019t see a line item for them on your bill. And even if you\u2019re poor enough that you don\u2019t even see a bill, that doesn\u2019t mean no one\u2019s paying. That\u2019s why millions of Americans who\u2019ve lost their health insurance thanks to Obamacare are discovering that the new plans it offers are either more expensive, have higher deductibles, or both.\n\nAlso, prevention doesn\u2019t necessarily save money. I know that Benjamin Franklin said an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. (People always leave out the fact that he owned an insurance company that ran at a profit.) The idea that prevention saves money is one of these things that intuitively sounds like it has to be true. But think about it.\n\nAccording to the National Cancer Institute, 12.4 percent of American women will get breast cancer at some point in their lives. So for every positive diagnosis there are seven negative diagnoses. Those tests cost a lot of money. Moreover, of the women who do get it, premature screenings won\u2019t necessarily catch it. That in no way means that screenings don\u2019t make sense. They do, particularly for women in high-risk groups. But testing everybody isn\u2019t a great way to save money. As the Congressional Budget Office reported in August, \u201cThe evidence suggests that for most preventive services, expanded utilization leads to higher, not lower, medical spending overall.\u201d\n\nWhen presented with these and other facts, Obamacare\u2019s defenders note that the rate of increase in health-care costs has slowed in recent years. \u201cI\u2019m not going to walk away from something that has helped the cost of health care grow at its slowest rate in 50 years,\u201d Obama said last month.\n\nThis spin doesn\u2019t work either. The slowing of health-care costs began a decade ago, and even the administration\u2019s own actuaries say the recent drop is mostly attributable to the lousy economy. But even that\u2019s too generous to Obama. Costs haven\u2019t dropped. The rate of increase in spending has slowed. We\u2019re still on course to spend a record $2.9 trillion on health care in 2013.\n\nObamacare may have been sold on a trinity of lies, but it turns out it\u2019s also lies all the way down.", "article_metadata": {"title": "Obamacare: Lies All the Way Down | RealClearPolitics", "og": {"url": "http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2013/12/14/obamacare_lies_all_the_way_down_120954.html", "image": "http://www.realclearpolitics.com/images/rcp-home-logo-ss.png", "type": "article", "title": "Obamacare: Lies All the Way Down | RealClearPolitics"}, "twitter": {"site": "@TomBevanRCP", "card": "summary"}, "tweetmeme-title": "Obamacare: Lies All the Way Down | RealClearPolitics", "fb": {"app_id": 1415921935346245}, "keywords": "Health care,", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda0af\"", "article_summary": "Obamacare may have been sold on a trinity of lies, but it turns out it\u2019s also lies all the way down.\nThree Harvard economists wrote a memo in 2007 in which they claimed that then-Senator Obama\u2019s health-care plan would reduce national health-care spending by $200 billion.\nBut testing everybody isn\u2019t a great way to save money.\nThat\u2019s why millions of Americans who\u2019ve lost their health insurance thanks to Obamacare are discovering that the new plans it offers are either more expensive, have higher deductibles, or both.\nAlso, prevention doesn\u2019t necessarily save money."}
