I made a promise that once health care passed, I would never have a cigarette again. And I have not.\n\nObama had struggled with the habit in the past, and The Hill reported that one of the reasons he said he finally quit was because he was scared of his wife.\n\n\"Have I fallen off the wagon sometimes? Yes. Am I a daily smoker, a constant smoker? No,\" Obama said at a press conference in 2009, according to The Hill.\n\nObama's desire to quit follows the national trend. More American adults today are former smokers than current ones, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. And 69% of current smokers say they want to quit.\n\nThe number of adults in the US who smoke has fallen since the health care bill passed, too \u2014 from around 20% in 2010 to about 17% today:\n\nAnd that drop is part of a larger trend over time. More than 42% of adults smoked in 1965.\n\nThere have been rumors that Obama has fallen off the wagon, even recently. When this picture surfaced on Instagram in June, people speculated that it looked like the President was holding a pack of cigarettes in his hand:\n\nTalking #elmau #g7 #cosedilavoro #germania A photo posted by Nomfup (@nomfup) on Jun 7, 2015 at 8:03am PDT on Jun 7, 2015 at 8:03am PDT\n\nBut the White House denied that's what he was holding.\n\nObama's commitment to smoking cessation is good news for him, and the country.
