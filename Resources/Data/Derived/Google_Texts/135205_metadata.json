Everything is OK. Then it\u2019s not. Then it is again. What felt early on like a roller coaster becomes the new normal. In between swerves and plummets, it is almost possible to doze off.\n\nAnd planning for all possible eventualities is useless \u2014 after the essential documents are in place, the family has talked openly and often about end-of-life wishes, they understand the difference between Medicare and Medicaid, they know how much money is available and that it is probably not going to be enough.\n\nCaregivers and their elderly charges both know, in a spoken or unspoken way, that on the horizon is The Crisis. That\u2019s the one that demarcates \u201cbefore\u201d and \u201cafter.\u201d Your parents are at home, say, when they really shouldn\u2019t be, and don\u2019t want to leave. The Crisis, when it appears, will be an awful milestone for them and probably so for you, the adult child.\n\nThen one day the roles shift and the crisis on the horizon could be yours. Maybe your parents are dead or maybe not, but you\u2019re now an old person. It happens even if you\u2019re diligent about antioxidants and fish oil, exercise both body and mind, have a cheery attitude, good genes and a wide social network. If you\u2019re not there yet, you\u2019ll have to take my word for it.\n\nSo today, on my 66th birthday, I can call myself middle-aged but it isn\u2019t true. The Census Bureau offers one kind of proof. The various body parts that don\u2019t work like they used to offer another kind. It obviously didn\u2019t happen overnight, but sometimes it seems that way. Young yesterday. Old today.\n\nSo this is put-up-or-shut-up time. I either take my own hard-won advice or I\u2019d better stop dishing it out.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t wait for a crisis.\u201d\n\nI am weary of shoveling snow and bailing a flooded basement. Unsure about the risk versus benefits of trying to change those high-hat lightbulbs in the ceiling by myself. Plain lucky to wind up with only carpet burns after falling down the stairs. And another hurricane season looms. None of these, in isolation, is The Crisis. But there\u2019s certainly a trend developing around here.\n\nSo I\u2019m moving.\n\nFor a long time, I\u2019ve known I wanted to quit the suburbs, even if it meant trading the chirp of crickets for the screech of car alarms and depriving my dog the woods outside our back door. I want ambient street life, endless opportunities to eavesdrop, takeout menus shoved under my door, grocery stores that stay open past 10 p.m., a MetroCard instead of parking tickets, movie theaters within walking distance. My friends.\n\nMaybe I don\u2019t need Access-a-Ride and a MedicAlert pendant yet. Until I do, the city will be fun. After I do, it\u2019ll be necessary.\n\nAfter 17 years in the most wonderful place I\u2019ve ever lived, I\u2019ve sold my house. My feelings are mixed, to put it mildly. I\u2019ve loved the proud stewardship of a small piece of local history, the only property remaining from when this tract of land was the LeBoutillier Estate, with its own drawer at the Hastings Historical Society.\n\nBut this is a bad place to be a spinster lady (I\u2019m allowed to put it that way because I\u2019m talking about myself and have always liked the word). The deal was sealed after a year of eye surgeries that made driving impossible and a night cowering in the basement with the dog while Hurricane Sandy sent gigantic spruce trees within inches of the house.\n\nThis is a place for someone younger than I am \u2014 or someone with a strong man who\u2019s good with power tools. I\u2019d rather move while I can make these decisions semi-voluntarily, not after I\u2019ve amputated a hand using a rented chainsaw.\n\nWriting to my neighbors on the local e-mail list, telling them the news and describing the buyers, I said, \u201cEspecially after so many years writing about elderly parents and their grown children, and giving others advise about not waiting for The Crisis, how foolish I\u2019d feel if I waited for The Crisis myself.\u201d\n\nMoving is hard enough without it also being a signifier of old age. Scribbling anxiously on Post-its helps me.\n\n\u201cHave the painter find a peachy color, but a little deeper than here.\u201d \u201cGet the rugs cleaned in town because it\u2019s probably cheaper.\u201d\n\n\u201cHire my friends\u2019 children to help run a tag sale: furniture in mint condition, and rusty egg beaters.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt what point do I sell the car, and where\u2019s the title?\u201d \u201cDog groomer? Veterinarian?\u201d\n\nWhen I lose one of the Post-its, my first reaction is to freak. Is my mind going already, or have I just overloaded the circuit board? Then I remember why I\u2019m doing this at 66, not 86.", "article_metadata": {"ptime": 20130910113002, "BN": "newoldage", "dfp-ad-unit-path": "newoldage", "adxPage": "blog.nytimes.com/newoldage/post", "DISPLAYDATE": "September 10, 2013", "keywords": "Elder Care,Essay,Give and Take", "GBLC": "Essay;Give and Take", "communityAssetTaxonomy": "blogs/newoldage/Getting While the Getting Is Good ( 20130910 )", "PT": "Blogs", "author": "Jane Gross", "SCG": "newoldage", "sourceApp": "blogs", "CLMST": "Jane Gross", "byl": "Jane Gross", "twitter": {"description": "Suburbia is no place for a spinster lady.", "title": "Getting While the Getting Is Good", "url": "http://newoldage.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/09/10/getting-while-the-getting-is-good/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2013/09/10/health/move480/move480-thumbLarge.jpg", "site": "@TheNewOldAge", "card": "summary"}, "blogpostid": 100000002433940, "description": "Suburbia is no place for a spinster lady.", "robots": "noodp", "dat": "September 10, 2013", "article": {"tag": "Give and Take", "published_time": 1378827002, "collection": "http://json8.nytimes.com/services/json/sectionfronts/health/index.jsonp", "modified_time": "2013-10-02T18:45:33-04:00"}, "utime": 20131002184533, "communityAssetLabels": "NYT_Blogs", "PUD": 20130910, "pdate": 20130910, "des": "Elder Care", "thumbnail": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2013/09/10/health/move480/move480-thumbLarge.jpg", "og": {"site_name": "The New Old Age Blog", "description": "Suburbia is no place for a spinster lady.", "title": "Getting While the Getting Is Good", "url": "http://newoldage.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/09/10/getting-while-the-getting-is-good/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2013/09/10/health/move480/move480-superJumbo.jpg", "type": "article"}, "communityAssetURL": "http://newoldage.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/09/10/getting-while-the-getting-is-good/", "PUV": "normal", "hdl": "Getting While the Getting Is Good", "thumbnail_150": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2013/09/10/health/move480/move480-thumbLarge.jpg", "PST": "Blog Post"}, "article_summary": "After 17 years in the most wonderful place I\u2019ve ever lived, I\u2019ve sold my house.\n\u201cDon\u2019t wait for a crisis,\u201d I\u2019ve told readers of \u201cThe New Old Age,\u201d no doubt ad nauseam.\nAs just about everyone who has cared for an aging parent knows, getting old is both an inexorable and maddeningly unpredictable forward march.\nThis is a place for someone younger than I am \u2014 or someone with a strong man who\u2019s good with power tools.\nPhoto\u201cDon\u2019t wait for a crisis,\u201d I told a friend whose elderly parents were struggling to care for themselves and a big Connecticut home."}
