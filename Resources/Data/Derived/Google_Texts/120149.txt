UPDATE: The National Weather Service issued a severe thunderstorm watch for the entire state of New Jersey through 9 p.m.

Another oppressive late-summer day in New Jersey appears poised to end with a bang as severe thunderstorms could develop later in the afternoon, bringing high winds, heavy rains and lightning to the heat-steeped Garden State.

The National Weather Service’s Storm Prediction Center said there is an 80 percent chance a severe thunderstorm watch will be issued in the coming hours for the northern half of the state, but the entire state could see storms by day’s end.

Temperatures are nudging above 90 degrees in many areas, and with high humidity, it feels like more than a 100 in some parts of the state.



The abundant heat and humidity is creating a highly unstable and moisture-laden atmosphere, a veritable powder keg waiting for a match in terms of thunderstorm development. A cold-front is approaching from the west and is expected to trigger thunderstorm activity in the afternoon and evening.

Damaging winds are possible where the strongest storms develop and localized flooding is possible statewide as torrential rains are expected to accompany any storms that develop.

When the cold front passes over the state tonight, it will signal the end to a week marked by heat and humidity in New Jersey. Temperatures are expected to fall to much more seasonal levels to round out the weekend into the work week, with highs in the 70s and low 80s and lows in the upper 50s and low 60s.
