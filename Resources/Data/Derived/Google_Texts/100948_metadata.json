But consider something the architect of Trump Tower, Der Scutt, once said on how to evaluate the truth value of Donald Trump claims: \u201cdivide by two, then divide by four, and you\u2019re closer to the answer.\u201d\n\nTrump worships armed force, pronouncing at a rally in August in Derry, New Hampshire: \u201cI believe in the military and military strength more strongly than anybody running by a factor of a billion.\u201d (Applying Scutt\u2019s formula, that means Trump believes in military strength 125,000,000 times more than Lindsey Graham, who opened his presidential campaign with a promise to go to war with Iran.)\n\nWhen Trump speaks in the subjunctive mood, he can certainly sound like an aspiring dictator. Regarding a $2.5 billion plant Ford intends to build in Mexico, he announced that \u201cevery car, every truck, and every part manufactured in this plant that comes across the border, we\u2019re going to charge you a 35 percent tax\u2014O.K.?\u201d The Constitution, of course, grants Congress, not a president, the power to tax. Maybe it\u2019s just ignorance on his part. Or maybe, by \u201cwe\u201d he\u2019s referring to the Congressional coalition he\u2019s building in his spare time between stadium rallies. But if Trump has ever made reference to any understanding of the three coequal branches that govern the United States, I haven\u2019t noticed it.\n\nHe refers lustily to his passion to destroy the malcontents stabbing America in the back, longing for the days when they received summary executions: \u201cSo we get a traitor like Bergdahl, a dirty rotten traitor [pause for applause], who by the way when he deserted, six young beautiful people were killed trying to find him, right? . . . You know, in the old days:bing, bong.\u201d (Trump pantomimed cocking a rifle.) \u201cWhen we were strong, when we were strong.\u201d\n\nToo much to expect procedural niceties\u2014innocent until proven guilty?\u2014from the guy who in 1989 took out full-page ads in four New York newspapers, headlined: \u201cBring Back the Death Penalty. Bring Back Our Police!\u201d There followed a 600-word essay: \u201cWhat has happened is the complete breakdown of life as we know it. . . . How can our great society tolerate the continued brutalization of its citizens by crazed misfits? Criminals must be told that their CIVIL LIBERTIES END WHEN AN ATTACK ON OUR SAFETY BEGINS.\u201d It went on to relate a tale from some mystically perfect past, where he witnessed \u201ctwo young bullies cursing and threatening a very frightened waitress. Two cops rushed in, lifted up the thugs and threw them out the door, warning them never to cause trouble again. I miss the feeling of security New York\u2019s finest once gave the citizens of this City.\u201d\n\nThe ad was Trump\u2019s response to the arrest of five kids for the vicious rape and beating of a jogger in Central Park. The kids were coerced into confessions, later proven to be false, by the same police force Donald Trump insisted had been intimidated into politically correct timorousness. Last year, after the five families settled for $41 million in compensation for the years the accused youths spent in prison, Trump published an op-ed calling the settlement \u201cridiculous.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese men do not exactly have the pasts of angels,\u201d he claimed. At the time of the event, one of \u201cthese men\u201d was 14 years old.\n\nA demagoguery so pure\n\nTrump has now provided more \u201cspecifics\u201d about his immigration plan: a forced population transfer greater than any attempted in history, greater than the French and Spanish expulsions of the Jews in 1308 and 1492; greater than the Nabka of approximately 700,000 Palestinian Arabs from British-mandate Palestine; greater than the 1.5 million Stalin consigned to Siberia and the Central Asian republics; greater than Pol Pot\u2019s exile of 2.5 million city-dwellers to the Cambodian countryside, or the scattering of Turkey\u2019s Assyrian Christians, which the scholar Mordechai Zaken says numbers in the millions and required 180 years to complete. Trump has promised to move 12 million Mexicans in under two years\u2013\u2013\u201cso fast your head will spin.\u201d\n\nOnly then will he start building the wall.\n\nBut all Republican politicians say stuff like this, right? They all want a wall, they all want to bury criminals under the jail, they all crave war, even if they\u2019re not quite so explicit about it.\n\nNot quite, actually. Previous Republican leaders were sufficiently frightened by the daemonic anger that energized their constituencies that they avoided surrendering to it completely, even for political advantage. Think of Barry Goldwater, who was so frightened of the racists supporting him that he told Lyndon Johnson he\u2019d drop out of the race if they started making race riots a campaign issue. And Ronald Reagan refusing to back a 1978 ballot initiative to fire gay schoolteachers in California, at a time vigilantes were hunting down gays in the street. Think of George W. Bush guiding Congress toward a comprehensive immigration bill (akin to that proposed by President Obama) until the onslaught of vitriol that talk-radio hosts directed at Republican members of Congress forced him to quit. Think of George W. Bush\u2019s repeated references to Islam as a \u201creligion of peace.\u201d\n\nTrumpism is different. Donald Trump is the first Republican presidential front-runner to venture a demagogy so pure.\n\nBut isn\u2019t he just giving Republican voters what they want? Isn\u2019t this attention-starved shell of a man, a salesman ideationally hollow at the core, only following the smart money? A friend of mine argues that Trump would be perfectly willing to shift his \u201ccore\u201d issue from immigration if the political winds change. Too shallow to venture dictatorship: he doesn\u2019t have anything to dictate. Which actually is the opposite of encouraging.\n\nIn the Derry event referenced above, Trump went into a familiar riff: \u201cChina is killing us! They\u2019ve taken so much of our wealth. They\u2019ve taken our jobs. They\u2019ve taken our businesses, they\u2019ve taken our manufacturing.\u201d\n\nThen an audience member cried out: \u201cOur land!\u201d\n\nTrump paused, pondered, gave it back as a question: \u201cOur land?\u201d\n\nThen, why not? He decided to roll with the thought: \u201cThe way they\u2019re going, they\u2019ll have that pretty soon.\u201d\n\nI think I know the conspiracy theory that perfervid Granite Stater was referring to. I heard it in Orange County about a decade ago. Chinese nationals were buying up residential real estate to make a killing at the expense of the Americans who actually lived there. Trump clearly hadn\u2019t heard it, but soon he will, and maybe he\u2019ll fold that count into his rap. Watch for it.\n\nMan and mob\n\nMy main interest, though, is that moment of symbiosis between man and mob. They feed off each other. The way his people eat up Trump\u2019s unalloyed joy in bullying: the way a purse of his lips and a glance offstage summoned the security guard who ejected Univision\u2019s Jorge Ramos from a press conference, like a casino pit boss with a whale who gets too handsy with the cocktail waitresses. Trump\u2019s not-quite-veiled threat to Megyn Kelly: \u201cI\u2019ve been very nice to you, although I could probably maybe not be. But I wouldn\u2019t do that.\u201d The body language he uses to intimidate a hapless and plaintive Jeb Bush during the second Republican debate.\n\nIf he\u2019s just giving the people what they want, consider the people.\n\nConsider what they want.\n\nLast fall, the Public Religion Research Institute found that a majority of whites believe \u201cdiscrimination against whites has become as big a problem as discrimination against blacks and other minorities.\u201d A brand new Washington Post/ABC poll finds 57 percent of Republicans support the most massive ethnic cleansing in the annals of humanity (or, what The Washington Post blandly calls \u201cTrump\u2019s tough positions on immigration\u201d).\n\nPollsters at YouGov.com found that 29 percent of Americans (and 43 percent of Republicans) \u201cwould hypothetically support the military stepping in to take control from a civilian government which is beginning to violate the Constitution.\u201d Which is quite a thing, considering that according to a 2012 Gallup poll 94 percent of Republicans consider Obamacare\u2019s insurance-purchase mandates unconstitutional; not to mention the small technicality that the military taking control of the government for \u201cviolating the Constitution\u201d is, in fact, violating the Constitution.\n\nThen there is this. Evan Osnos of The New Yorker happened to be reporting on \u201cwhite nationalists\u201d\u2014the polite term for neo-Nazis\u2014when the Trump phenomenon began. The fortuitous coincidence ended up unfolding as a natural experiment. Osnos was able to watch in real time as his subjects embraced Trump as one of their own. Usually, such extremists judge Republicans as tweedle-dee to the Democrats\u2019 tweedle-dum. That\u2019s not how they saw Trump. TheDaily Stormer neo-Nazi web site endorsed him, advising its readers to \u201cvote for the first time in our lives for the one man who actually represents our interests.\u201d The leader of a white-supremacist think tank told The New Yorker: \u201cI don\u2019t think Trump is a white nationalist,\u201d although he did reflect \u201can unconscious vision that white people have\u2013\u2013that their grandchildren might be a hated minority in their own country . . . he is the one person who can tap into it.\u201d\n\nJared Taylor, editor of American Renaissance, a like-minded publication, observed: \u201cI\u2019m sure he would repudiate any association with people like me, but his support comes from people who are more like me than he might like to admit.\u201d\n\nBut was Taylor correct? Asked if he would repudiate the endorsement of erstwhile Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke, Trump\u2019s response was less than resounding: \u201cSure, I would if that would make you feel better.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cf-word\u201d\n\nThe \u201cf-word\u201d has nearly vanished from everyday political discussion in America, and for good reason. It\u2019s become the kind of epithet that stops thought instead of enhancing it. But serious people used to talk about the relevance of the German experience to American politics. In 1964, Philip Rahv, a founding editor of the marquee intellectual journal Partisan Review, wrote that the movement that nominated Barry Goldwater for president represented \u201ca recrudescence on American soil of precisely those super-nationalistic and right-wing trends that were finally defeated in Europe at the cost of a great war, untold misery, and many millions dead.\u201d\n\nBut within a couple of years, when student protesters were closing down universities through violence and the threat of violence, people like Ronald Reagan said that was exactly what fascists did, so he deployed National Guardsmen to keep campuses open\u2013\u2013which student protesters called fascist in turn.\n\nBy the end of the 1960s both sides were throwing the f-word at one another with abandon. But in current American politics, the word has survived via the abject stupidity of many thousands of right-wing readers of one of the worst books ever published, Jonah Goldberg\u2019s Liberal Fascism (2008), which made much of the fact that both Hitler and a heck of a lot of liberals were vegetarians.\n\nThe usage also survives among a considerably smaller number of only slightly less perfervid liberals. These folks borrow from the scholarship of outstanding historians like Roger Griffin, author of The Nature of Fascism, and Robert Paxton, author of The Anatomy of Fascism, and bastardize it into \u201cchecklists,\u201d the most widely circulated from an obscure political scientist about whom I could find nothing else\u2013\u2013Lawrence Britt\u2013\u2013who would have us believe that when a politician checks off enough boxes like \u201crampant sexism\u201d and \u201cobsession with national security,\u201d America will suddenly find itself locked into a totalitarian nightmare from which there is no escape except all-out war.\n\nBut this confuses a historically specific description with a usefully predictive model. It treats political development as a biological process, fascism as something nations \u201cdescend\u201d into\u2013\u2013the natural entropy of failed national institutions.\n\nIt\u2019s a devolution to an older style of political thinking that felt perfectly logical in the 1950s and early 1960s, among writers for whom civilization\u2019s descent into blood-soaked barbarism was recent memory. The writing that followed it was either explicitly or implicitly rooted in a Marxist style of thinking, which is to say a Hegelian style of thinking: if history was \u201csupposed\u201d to develop in a certain direction (toward socialism; toward liberal democracy), how, then, to account for the hard-right turn no one had predicted? The process of strong men taking advantage of weak men, with the strongman, his victims, and their willing executioners produced by the neuroses attending the breakdown of traditional ways of life, seemed to be encoded within modernity itself.\n\nAnd some of this story still rings so very true. Fascist leaders promise national rebirth, the merging of a mystically perfect past and a transcendent future from a present fatally compromised by wickedness. (Niftily, the scholarly term for that, as if nodding to John McCain\u2019s 2008 running mate, is \u201cpalingenetic ultranationalism.\u201d)\n\nBut lots of political movements do that. And history is not a biological process; there\u2019s no reason to believe that the alienation we see all around us need devolve into violent nationalism with its end state. Germany, Italy, Spain, Argentina, and Chile, to cite the major cases, in the peculiar moments when their strong men arose, suffered weaknesses in their institutions that are just about unimaginable in the United States. For instance, it is hard to imagine a President Trump turning America into a one-party state. (Isn\u2019t it?)\n\nMovie matinee monsters\n\nWhich provides us with a delicate analytical problem, because, all the same, the postwar thinkers making sense of that experience bequeathed useful tools of analysis, now mostly lost to us because of the discussion-busting nature of the f-word.\n\nSo, in fact, did popular culture.\n\nOrdinary people can become monsters. Everyone who experienced World War II knew that. How does it happen? Any attentive cinema-goer or TV-watcher of the 1950s would have a decent grasp of an answer. In Ace in the Hole, from 1951, a little-remembered Billy Wilder masterpiece, the effort to rescue a man trapped in a cave collapse in New Mexico turns into a lurid carnival as folks flock from miles around, with rides, concerts, and gambling. The party ends when the rescue fails, the man dies, and the revelers slink away in shame at how thin the veneer of civilization truly was. Likewise, in \u201cThe Shelter,\u201d a 1961 episode of The Twilight Zone, a convivial suburban neighborhood hears a radio announcement that reveals an impending nuclear attack, everyone flocks to the town\u2019s only fallout shelter, which can only accommodate three people, and the seething hostility, resentment, and racism none of them even understood themselves capable of surges to the surface\u2013\u2013until the announcement is revealed as a false alarm, and the threads of trust that had bound a community together are revealed as irreversibly vulnerable.\n\nThere are many more examples. In an interview with NPR\u2019s Terry Gross, the director Wes Craven explains what horror films are really about: \u201cfear, which is certainly one of the most primal, primal emotions.\u201d About \u201cthe necessity for taking action or else not surviving . . . . They always sort of perceive where there\u2019s sort of that subcutanenous, subconscious fear that\u2019s in the culture at the time . . . post-World War II where you had culture coming out of shock of what they had just seen . . . these sort of horrendous events being perpetrated by the Nazis, and in a sense by everybody that went to war against each other.\u201d Craven cited Alfred Hitchcock\u2019s Psycho, \u201cbecause that is a pure case of not a monster in the sense of Godzilla or something, but it\u2019s a human monster.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Previous right-wing leaders had a healthy fear of the rage they unleashed from their base.
