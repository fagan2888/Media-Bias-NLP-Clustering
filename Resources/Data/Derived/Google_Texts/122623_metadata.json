He said that Obamacare was \u201ca catalyst to look our student employment data, but not the sole reason we\u2019re making this move,\u201d as the university wants to keep students focused on classes instead of working.\n\nStudents aren\u2019t the only ones hurt by Obamacare-sparked cuts, however. Other university employees with variable hours, including adjunct professors and teaching assistants, have had their hours cut so avoid hefty employer mandate penalties as well.

Another 350 employers have also restricted work hours.

And a series of surveys by several Federal Reserve banks found that the Affordable Care Act is boosting part-time employment at the expense of full-time jobs.
