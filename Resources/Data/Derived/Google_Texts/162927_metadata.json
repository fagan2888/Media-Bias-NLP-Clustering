Unfortunately, utilization of Franklin Medical Center has declined significantly over several years.\u201d\n\nDr. Holmes has been studying issues facing rural hospitals and notes 57 have closed nationwide since 2010, including three in North Carolina. They include Yadkin Valley Community Hospital, Vidant Pungo Hospital and Blowing Rock Hospital. An Associated Press investigation earlier this year found four out of 62 other rural hospitals in the state are considered \u201cvulnerable.\u201d\n\n\u201cMany of them are trying to find ways to reopen, and most of them have not been successful,\u201d said Holmes. \u201cWe do see some circumstances where the hospital can turn it around. But, for the most part it\u2019s usually a long and slow steady change.\u201d\n\nHolmes says several factors have come together to create the situation including: the economic collapse, dwindling rural populations, changing insurance reimbursement rates and better technology that allows people to treated outside of hospitals.\n\nFor patients, the change can be significant.\n\n\u201cNow in Louisburg, looks like you\u2019ll be about 30 minutes away from the closest emergency room,\u201d said Holmes. \u201cThat extra 30 minutes can be really literally a matter of life and death.\u201d\n\nFranklin Medical Center will continue admitting patients to its emergency room until 7 a.m. Friday, at which point the doors will close permanently.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Franklin Medical Center will continue admitting patients to its emergency room until 7 a.m. Friday, at which point the doors will close perm\u2026", "generator": "WordPress.com", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=425414520", "og": {"site_name": "WNCN", "description": "Franklin Medical Center will continue admitting patients to its emergency room until 7 a.m. Friday, at which point the doors will close permanently.", "title": "Louisburg hospital closing is part of larger trend among rural hospitals", "url": "http://wncn.com/2015/10/10/louisburg-hospital-closing-is-part-of-larger-trend-among-rural-hospitals/", "image": {"width": 660, "identifier": "https://mgtvwncn.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/er.jpg", "height": 371}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Franklin Medical Center will continue admitting patients to its emergency room until 7 a.m. Friday, at which point the doors will close permanently.", "title": "Louisburg hospital closing is part of larger trend among rural hospitals", "image": {"src": "https://mgtvwncn.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/er.jpg?w=640"}, "creator": "@wncn", "site": "wncn", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "keywords": ",Local news, News, North Carolina news, Top Videos,By Michael Hyland, WNCN News", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.doapps.android.mln.MLN_4ef95b9ddabd80873ba6a8406f5bfa55", "fb": {"pages": 69688774749}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://wncn.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/caee67290db345cd25db23a5a27c462f?s=16", "application-name": "WNCN", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/WNCNTV", "published_time": "2015-10-11T01:09:25+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-10-11T03:17:51+00:00"}, "msvalidate.01": "25404283363C09DE121A55A903F03873", "google-site-verification": "JziH-ux2vlTCnig0bnUsUMzGF0B1kdNRMW7oV48jIEc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "LOUISBURG (WNCN) \u2013 Next week\u2019s closure of Novant Health\u2019s Franklin Medical Center is part of a larger trend among struggling rural hospitals that shows signs of accelerating, according to UNC\u2019s Dr. Mark Holmes.\nEfforts to keep the medical center have been happening for more than a year.\nFranklin Medical Center is projected to lose up to $6.7 million this year, a hospital spokeswoman said.\nThey include Yadkin Valley Community Hospital, Vidant Pungo Hospital and Blowing Rock Hospital.\n\u201cNow in Louisburg, looks like you\u2019ll be about 30 minutes away from the closest emergency room,\u201d said Holmes."}
