Participants were first asked to fill out a questionnaire covering mood, quality of life, and sleep. They were then asked to attend weekly 90-minute mediation sessions.\n\nAt the end of the experiment, participants were asked to fill out the same questionnaire a second time. The team found that, compared to a control group that had not attended the sessions, the treatment group displayed significant improvements in all areas. \u201cWe analyzed differences in mood, sleep, and quality of life scores for each participant and then between each group to evaluate if mindfulness sessions had a greater impact than the simple passage of time,\u201d the authors explained. \u201cWe found that teenagers that participated in the mindfulness group had lower scores in depression after our eight sessions.\u201d\n\nNotably, the positive results appeared to be more pronounced in girls. Compared to their male counterparts, female participants slept better and developed greater mindfulness skills, Malboeuf-Hurtubise said.\n\nThe current study dovetails with a number of other efforts to illuminate clinical benefits of mindfulness meditation. Another example is a 2013 study published in the journal Psychoneuroendocrinology, in which researchers from the University of Wisconsin-Madison show that mindfulness-based sessions may suppress inflammation by altering gene expression.\n\nGiven the relatively small sample size, the team is hesitant to make any broader recommendations until more research can be conducted. That said, the findings provide strong evidence that mindfulness meditation may reduce at least some of the emotional symptoms brought on by exhaustive chemo- and radiotherapy.\n\n\u201cThe social support provided to the adolescents in the mindfulness group could possibly explain observed benefits on mood and sleep,\u201d Malboeuf-Hurtubise said. \u201cNonetheless, mindfulness-based interventions for teenagers with cancer appear as a promising option to lighten psychological inconveniences of living with cancer.\u201d\n\nThe study's findings were presented this week at the annual meeting of the American Psychosomatic Society in San Francisco.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "mindfulness meditation, cancer, teens, quality of life, meditation and cancer, meditation and cancer treatment", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Mindfulness meditation was shown to improve sleep and reduce depressive symptoms in adolescents with cancer in a small, eight-week study.", "title": "Mindfulness Meditation Helps Teens Fight Cancer", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/mindfulness-meditation-cuts-emotional-symptoms-boosts-quality-life-teens-cancer-271334", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/03/16/meditation.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Mindfulness meditation was shown to improve sleep and reduce depressive symptoms in adolescents with cancer in a small, eight-week study.", "title": "Mindfulness Meditation Helps Teens Fight Cancer", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/mindfulness-meditation-cuts-emotional-symptoms-boosts-quality-life-teens-cancer-271334", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/03/16/meditation.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/03/16/meditation.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Healthy Living", "published_time": "2014-03-16T13:08:50-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-03-16T13:08:49-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Mindfulness meditation was shown to improve sleep and reduce depressive symptoms in adolescents with cancer in a small, eight-week study."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcecc3\"", "article_summary": "New research suggests that mindfulness meditation may help teenagers with cancer cope with symptoms, illuminating a new palliative care strategy.\nMindfulness meditation was shown to improve sleep and reduce depressive symptoms in adolescents with cancer in a small, eight-week study.\nThat said, the findings provide strong evidence that mindfulness meditation may reduce at least some of the emotional symptoms brought on by exhaustive chemo- and radiotherapy.\nThe current study dovetails with a number of other efforts to illuminate clinical benefits of mindfulness meditation.\n\u201cThe social support provided to the adolescents in the mindfulness group could possibly explain observed benefits on mood and sleep,\u201d Malboeuf-Hurtubise said."}
