In an open letter addressed to Seven & i's board in March, Loeb had called Isaka the leading candidate to helm the group.\n\nBut earlier this month, Isaka was targeted by Seven & i's charismatic CEO Toshifumi Suzuki for an ouster, which failed after a close board vote, leading to the 83-year-old Suzuki resigning his post.\n\nThe leadership fight at the 7-Eleven parent is a sign of improving corporate governance in Japan as the board refused to rubber-stamp the powerful CEO, analysts have said.\n\nSeven & i on Tuesday also nominated Katsuhiro Goto, currently its Chief Administrative Officer, to its No. 2 post, and Kazuki Furuya to succeed Isaka as president of Seven-Eleven Japan. The appointments are subject to approval by shareholders.\n\n\"We apologize to all stakeholders for creating disturbance over our personnel matters,\" Isaka said in a statement announcing the new management.\n\nTOUGH TASK AHEAD\n\nThe new management, though, faces a tough task to steer the company that had been built up over decades by Suzuki, a legendary figure in Japan's retail industry, and to carry out a drastic restructuring of its loss-making supermarket chain Ito-Yokado demanded by Loeb's company Third Point and some other shareholders. Third Point owns an undisclosed stake in Seven & i.\n\n\"They should work on improving profit, including giving consideration to Third Point's demand to offload it,\" said Takayuki Suzuki, an independent retail analyst, referring to Ito-Yokado.\n\nRecent acquisitions of companies such as luxury clothing store Barneys Japan and mail-order business Nissen should also be reconsidered, he said.\n\n\"The M&A deals under Suzuki were mistakes. There were no synergies from Nissen and Barneys, and they needed to be cut off. So it will involve rejecting a lot of what was done under the Suzuki leadership,\" he said.\n\nSeven & i shares, which have risen 5.5 percent since the management tussle took a dramatic turn two weeks ago, ended 1.2 percent higher on Tuesday, ahead of the announcement of the appointments.\n\n(Additional reporting by Ritsuko Ando; Editing by Edwina Gibbs and Muralikumar Anantharaman)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's Seven & i named an executive backed by U.S.", "title": "Japan's Seven & i names Loeb-backed executive leader after power struggle", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/04/19/Japans-Seven-i-names-Loeb-backed-executive-leader-after-power-struggle", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/seven-i-hldgs-ceo_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/04/19/Japans-Seven-i-names-Loeb-backed-executive-leader-after-power-struggle", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/seven-i-hldgs-ceo_1.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's Seven & i named an executive backed by U.S.", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Isaka, 58, a career insider at Seven-Eleven Japan, has been credited with driving the growth of the convenience store chain.\nSeven & i, Japan's biggest retail group, said its board on Tuesday nominated Ryuichi Isaka, currently head of its profitable convenience store unit Seven-Eleven Japan, to be the president of the parent.\nIn an open letter addressed to Seven & i's board in March, Loeb had called Isaka the leading candidate to helm the group.\n2 post, and Kazuki Furuya to succeed Isaka as president of Seven-Eleven Japan.\nRecent acquisitions of companies such as luxury clothing store Barneys Japan and mail-order business Nissen should also be reconsidered, he said."}
