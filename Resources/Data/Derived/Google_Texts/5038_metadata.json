Fiorina became the most powerful woman in business as an executive with Lucent Technologies in the late 1990s, but she was launched into celebrity CEO status when she took over the top job at storied-but-faltering Hewlett-Packard in 1999. Fiorina was the first outsider to be chief executive at HP, and she was the first woman to take the helm of a company in the Dow 30. Just as \u201cHillary\u201d was enough to identify the First Lady, \u201cCarly\u201d quickly became enough to identify the top woman in the world of business and technology.\n\nIf that job helped Fiorina become a star in Corporate America and a familiar name to many outside of it, her record at HP has left plenty of room for critics \u2014 and there are plenty of those, too \u2014 to challenge her claims of offering \u201creal leadership.\u201d\n\nNow that Fiorina, 60, has announced that she is running for president and her campaign website, carlyforpresident.com, attempts to draw parallels between the state of HP when she arrived and the state of the country today, it\u2019s worth looking at just what the former CEO accomplished.\n\nRelated: Will an Overcrowded Field Ruin GOP Chances in 2016?\n\nFiorina\u2019s website touts her rise from \u201ca secretary for a small real estate business\u201d to the first woman to lead a company in the top 50 of the Fortune 500, and it labels her \u201ca problem solver with a track record to prove it.\u201d The site calls out the financial results HP generated under Fiorina, like doubling revenue and rising from the 28th-largest company in the U.S. to the 11th-largest.\n\n\u201cCarly didn\u2019t always make the most popular decisions at HP \u2014 but, time and time again, they would prove to be the right ones,\u201d the website says.\n\nA decade after her departure from HP, her legacy is far more questionable than that line suggests. By the time she was forced out of HP after 5 1/2 tumultuous years \u2014 and one long, bruising proxy battle to cement the ultimately unsuccessful mega-merger with Compaq Computer \u2014 HP\u2019s shares were worth less than half what they had been when she took over. A devastating 2005 analysis by Fortune\u2019s Carol Loomis concluded that Fiorina\u2019s merger with Compaq had failed to deliver value for shareholders and failed to position HP to compete better in a rapidly evolving tech world.\n\n\u201cThis was a big bet that didn't pay off, that didn't even come close to attaining what Fiorina and HP's board said was in store,\u201d Loomis wrote. And a competing website that Fiorina\u2019s camp neglected to register \u2014 CarlyFiorina.org \u2014 on Monday featured row after row of frown-face emoticons to represent the 30,000 people Fiorina laid off in her time at HP.\n\nFiorina and others have argued that she laid the groundwork for some of HP\u2019s progress under her successors and that she shook up a hidebound culture that needed to be remade to compete in the Internet Age. \"Carly was brought in to catalyze a transformation of HP. She did that in a remarkable fashion,\" Patricia Dunn, the HP board member who would become the company\u2019s chairwoman after Fiorina\u2019s ouster, said at the time. \"Looking forward, we think the job is very reliant on hands-on execution, and we thought a new set of capabilities was called for.\"\n\nRelated: Carson and Fiorina: Two Ankle Biters Join the GOP Pack\n\nHP has since had five CEOs, and it\u2019s arguably still looking for the right path forward. Fiorina had reportedly told analysts in 2004 that the company had considered splitting up into parts on three different occasions and rejected the idea each time. Last year \u2014 a decade later \u2014 HP under CEO Meg Whitman announced it would split HP into two companies, one for enterprise and services businesses and the other for its PC and printers lines. Whether that decision succeeds or not, it illustrates that the legendary company\u2019s problems and lack of strategic direction went much deeper than just Fiorina: They started before she arrived and continued long after she left.\n\nStill Fiorina\u2019s bruising tenure at HP failed to reinvigorate the iconic Silicon Valley company, and it tarnished her credentials as an executive. In fact, HP\u2019s share price jumped on the day her departure was announced. \"The stock is up a bit on the fact that nobody liked Carly's leadership all that much,\" Robert Cihra, an analyst with Fulcrum Global Partners, told CNN Money that day in 2005. \"The Street had lost all faith in her, and the market's hope is that anyone will be better.\"\n\nThat record doesn\u2019t sound like a springboard to the highest office in the land.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Carleton S.", "title": "Carly Fiorina\u2019s Real Record at HP: Is She Presidential Material?", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/05/05/Carly-Fiorina-s-Real-Record-HP-She-Presidential-Material", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/05052015_Carly_Fiorina.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/05/05/Carly-Fiorina-s-Real-Record-HP-She-Presidential-Material", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/05052015_Carly_Fiorina.jpg", "title": "The Fiscal Times", "card": "summary", "creator": "@yuvalrosenberg"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "Carleton S.", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Still Fiorina\u2019s bruising tenure at HP failed to reinvigorate the iconic Silicon Valley company, and it tarnished her credentials as an executive.\n\u201cCarly didn\u2019t always make the most popular decisions at HP \u2014 but, time and time again, they would prove to be the right ones,\u201d the website says.\nShe did that in a remarkable fashion,\" Patricia Dunn, the HP board member who would become the company\u2019s chairwoman after Fiorina\u2019s ouster, said at the time.\nA decade after her departure from HP, her legacy is far more questionable than that line suggests.\nJust as \u201cHillary\u201d was enough to identify the First Lady, \u201cCarly\u201d quickly became enough to identify the top woman in the world of business and technology."}
