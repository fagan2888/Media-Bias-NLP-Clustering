They\u2019re no longer \u201cnice-to-haves,\u201d but are quickly becoming necessities as senior residents expect technology and transportation to cater to their specific purposes.\n\nTo find out what will be essential in senior living design in 2014, we polled the judges panel from our 2013 Senior Housing News Architecture & Design Awards to get their expert take on what\u2019s hot in the new year of senior living design.\n\nHere\u2019s what they had to say.\n\n1. Customization.\n\nShifts in consumer preferences will continue to drive changes in senior living environments in 2014, according to the judges from this year\u2019s SHN Design Awards. Accommodating the demands of prospective residents will prove critical for providers to remain competitive.\n\n\u201cCompanies must meet these demands in all areas in order to keep up in a market with mounting competition,\u201d says Raquel Mercer, vice president of Robycross. \u201cWhether that means adding a new level of care that the community didn\u2019t previously offer or modernizing the look and feel to an updated palate, all communities can feel the pressure to make a change.\u201d\n\nStepping away from cookie cutter unit layouts, placing greater emphasis on individual living spaces instead can also help senior living providers hone in on the changing expectations of future residents.\n\n\u201cOne of the most important innovations has to be the inclusion of resident choice and input into their personal living spaces,\u201d says Jeff Anderzhon, FAIA, Eppstein Uhen Architects. \u201dWe are all individuals and want our living spaces to reflect individuality.\u201d\n\n2. On-site services and the assisted living rehab hotel.\n\nIn 2014, senior living providers will not only have to accommodate their residents\u2019 expectations for more individualistic preferences and amenities, but they\u2019ll also have to cater to this aging population\u2019s growing care needs.\n\nOne of the single-most important senior living design innovations on the horizon in 2014 will be the \u201cassisted living rehab hotel\u201d that is connected to an outpatient rehab facility, says Dan Cinelli, managing principal at Perkins Eastmans.\n\nThis innovative design feature, he says, will be driven by healthcare reforms such as the Affordable Care Act and Accountable Care Organizations that aim to restrict short-term stays in nursing homes funded by Medicare, as well as the shrinkage of traditional assisted living use.\n\n3. Technology: once a luxury, now a necessity.\n\nArchitects agree that technology, what was once considered a luxury in senior living design, will become a necessity in 2014 and beyond. As more seniors are becoming \u201cwired,\u201d or \u201cplugged-in,\u201d to current technologies, communities that don\u2019t include spaces that facilitate Internet connectivity run the risk of having a dated aesthetic.\n\n\u201cTechnology will shape senior living design in 2014,\u201d says David Dillard, principal at D2 Architecture.\n\nThis could mean the return of digital-centric spaces\u2014formerly known as \u201cinternet cafes\u201d and \u201ccomputer training rooms\u201d\u2014into the common areas of independent living and assisted living communities.\n\n\u201cI believe we will see a more purposeful investment in making these small, but important spaces work for marketing purposes and \u201cfor real\u201d as each wave of senior residents crosses the threshold more wired, and more ready to Skype, blog, Facebook, and email with friends and loved ones off campus,\u201d Dillard says.\n\nTechnology that connects residents with their friends and family beyond the walls of their communities stands to have one of the biggest impacts in senior living today, says Elisabeth Borden, principal of The Highland Group.\n\n\u2018These technologies expand the world of residents outside the walls of the buildings in ways that are often not possible physically,\u201d Borden says.\n\nSocially connected tech can also keep families more informed, she says, as well as foster greater resident engagement within their own communities by providing access to activities, menus, communications with staff and other residents, among other benefits.\n\n4. Wellness centers\n\nWellness and community centers that challenge the mind, body and spiritual requirements of residents will also continue to be a top-minded priority for senior living design in 2014.\n\n\u201cThere is arguably no other single issue in elderly congregate living which contributes to a rapid deterioration of health than loneliness and the feeling of isolation,\u201d says Anderzhon of Eppstein Uhen Architects. \u201cCommunity centers that provide choices of activities that bring people together and that challenge the physical, mental and spiritual capacities of those individuals also contribute to their overall health and happiness.\u201d\n\n5. Exterior services (think: \u201cunparking\u201d)\n\nCertain design trends might not even lie within a community\u2019s walls, but rather exterior amenities and services available for resident use, like car rental services for on-the-go seniors.\n\n\u201cCar rental by the hour for seniors, like Zip Car, can \u2018unpark\u2019 most CCRCs for cars that sit in the space and never move,\u201d says Cinelli. \u201cWe can use that parking for other uses.\u201d\n\nWritten by Jason Oliva", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "d2 architecture, eppstein uhen architects, perkins eastmans, robycross, the highland group, business, finance, real estate, senior housing", "og": {"site_name": "Senior Housing News", "description": "Add-on services, wellness programs and technology are just a few key aspects senior living professionals expect will earn their place as senior living mainstays in the following year and beyond.
