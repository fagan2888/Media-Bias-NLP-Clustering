Since then, he\u2019s continued hammering the real estate mogul on one issue after another, including Trump\u2019s tax returns. Romney said earlier this week that Trump's refusal to release them was \u201cdisqualifying.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is only one logical explanation for Mr. Trump's refusal to release his returns: there is a bombshell in them,\" he wrote in a Facebook post on Wednesday. \"Given Mr. Trump's equanimity with other flaws in his history, we can only assume it's a bombshell of unusual size.\"\n\nBut some conservatives are tired of Romney\u2019s continued attacks on Trump over this issue, especially now that he\u2019s the GOP\u2019s presumptive nominee.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s wrong with Mitt Romney. It\u2019s so strange,\u201d American Conservative Union Chairman Matt Schlapp said on Fox News. \u201cHe as a candidate didn\u2019t even release his taxes until Harry Reid took to the floor and claimed that maybe he didn\u2019t pay any income taxes at all, and now all of a sudden Mitt Romney is chastising Donald Trump for not releasing his taxes.\u201d\n\nHe continued: \u201cA lot of us voted for him [Romney]. I voted for him, I held my nose, he wasn\u2019t a conservative, and now he thinks he\u2019s channeling conservatives in attacking Donald Trump over this. You know what I\u2019d like Mitt Romney to do? Go home and be quiet, or, start focusing on Hillary Clinton. She\u2019s our political opponent.\u201d\n\nWhile the GOP is divided after a long and fractious primary, it seems we can all agree\u2014as House Speaker Paul Ryan and Donald Trump said this week in a joint statement\u2014the country can\u2019t afford another four years of the Obama White House, which is exactly what we\u2019ll get if Clinton is elected.\n\nSchlapp is correct: It\u2019s time to start focusing on Hillary.", "article_metadata": {"description": "It's time to focus on Hillary. .05/27/2016 8:09:03AM EST.", "author": "Leah Barkoukis", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "It's time to focus on Hillary.", "title": "Leah Barkoukis - ACU Chairman: Mitt Romney Needs to 'Go Home and Be Quiet'", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/leahbarkoukis/2016/05/14/acu-chairman-mitt-romney-needs-to-go-home-and-be-quiet-n2162853", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2014/24/2014-01-24T152824Z_1_CBREA0N16ZE00_RTROPTP_3_USA-REPUBLICANS-CPAC.JPG", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "It's time to focus on Hillary.", "title": "Leah Barkoukis - ACU Chairman: Mitt Romney Needs to 'Go Home and Be Quiet'", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/leahbarkoukis/2016/05/14/acu-chairman-mitt-romney-needs-to-go-home-and-be-quiet-n2162853", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2014/24/2014-01-24T152824Z_1_CBREA0N16ZE00_RTROPTP_3_USA-REPUBLICANS-CPAC.JPG", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "ACU Chairman: Mitt Romney Needs to 'Go Home and Be Quiet', Leah Barkoukis, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "Mitt Romney devoted an entire speech back in March to attacking Donald Trump in an effort to steer conservatives away from the businessman.\nYou know what I\u2019d like Mitt Romney to do?\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s wrong with Mitt Romney.\nSince then, he\u2019s continued hammering the real estate mogul on one issue after another, including Trump\u2019s tax returns.\nI voted for him, I held my nose, he wasn\u2019t a conservative, and now he thinks he\u2019s channeling conservatives in attacking Donald Trump over this."}
