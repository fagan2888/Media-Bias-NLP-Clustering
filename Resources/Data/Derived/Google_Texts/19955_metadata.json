The results were disastrous \u2014 so disastrous that many in Colorado started referring to the law as \u201cTABOG\u201d \u2014 the \u201cTaxpayer Bill of Goods.\u201d\n\nNow, the North Carolina Senate is trying to foist this failed gimmick on on us. Here, as reported by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, are just some of the dreadful things that happened to Colorado and that led state business leaders to push through a five-year suspension of the law:\n\n\u201cColorado\u2019s national rankings on a number of public services plummeted under TABOR. For example:\n\nColorado fell from 35th to 49th in the nation in K-12 spending as a percentage of personal income.\n\nCollege and university funding as a share of personal income declined from 35th in the nation to 48th.\n\nColorado fell to near the bottom of national rankings in providing children with full, on-time vaccinations.\n\nThe share of low-income children in the state who lacked health insurance doubled, making Colorado the worst in the nation by this measure.\n\nIn addition, TABOR failed to improve Colorado\u2019s business climate or economy, contrary to the predictions of its supporters. Instead it contributed to a credit rating downgrade and alarmed business leaders by undermining the state\u2019s ability to invest in its basic infrastructure and workforce.\u201d\n\nIt is because of reasons like these that, since Colorado adopted TABOR, every other state that has gotten close has rejected it. In several instances, it was voters themselves who said \u201cno.\u201d\n\nToday, in an extremely positive development, North Carolina Treasurer Janet Cowell stated her strong opposition to the Senate proposal based on the threat it would pose to the state\u2019s hard won AAA bond rating. This makes sense given that bond houses specifically cited TABOR in downgrading Colorado\u2019s credit rating.\n\nLet\u2019s hope that Cowell\u2019s statement helps tip the scale on this disastrous proposal. Stay tuned.", "article_metadata": {"fb": {"pages": 71966175060}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://pulse.ncpolicywatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/cropped-logo_shadow-square-270x270.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1586\"", "article_summary": "Colorado is the only state in the nation to have enacted the ALEC-inspired \u201cTaxpayer Bill of Rights\u201d or \u201cTABOR\u201d constitutional amendment.\nThe results were disastrous \u2014 so disastrous that many in Colorado started referring to the law as \u201cTABOG\u201d \u2014 the \u201cTaxpayer Bill of Goods.\u201dNow, the North Carolina Senate is trying to foist this failed gimmick on on us.\nThe share of low-income children in the state who lacked health insurance doubled, making Colorado the worst in the nation by this measure.\nIn addition, TABOR failed to improve Colorado\u2019s business climate or economy, contrary to the predictions of its supporters.\nCollege and university funding as a share of personal income declined from 35th in the nation to 48th."}
