He said that there may not even be elections in 2016; when pressed to explain further, Carson said,\n\n\u201cIf in fact we continue to have all these decrees being made the way they\u2019re being made, if in fact we don\u2019t fight the kind of war that needs to be fought in order to really put an end to the threat that is brought on by ISIS, if we continue along a pathway of financial irresponsibility, if we continue along a path of envy, greed, and hatred \u2014 what happened with Occupy Wall Street will be a cakewalk compared to what will begin to happen in this country.\u201d\n\nWhen Colmes pushed Carson further on the possibility of cancelled or postponed elections, Carson responded, \u201cI don\u2019t want to find out, I really don\u2019t want to find out. I don\u2019t want to continue down this pathway that we are going down. This pathway where everything is framed in a political sense and our representatives are not working for the people, they\u2019re working for their party.\u201d\n\nMartial law is \u201ca system of complete control by a country\u2019s military over all activities, including civilian, in a theoretical or actual war zone, or during a period of emergency caused by a disaster such as an earthquake or flood, with the military commander having dictatorial powers \u2026 In many foreign countries martial law has become a method to establish and maintain dictatorships either by military leaders or politicians backed by the military.\u201d\n\nIn America, martial law must be called for by the President, who would then suspend most, if not all, of our constitutional rights, and only the President would be able to reinstitute our constitutional structure and declare an end to martial law.\n\nPresident Obama, martial law and not leaving the White House in 2016\n\nIf anyone believes this idea is far fetched, please consider the numerous emergencies that Obama has put America in position to experience in the next two years \u2014 possibly with more than one of these issues occurring simultaneously: the Ebola virus and its associated mandatory quarantine may continue to spread due to Obama\u2019s pitiful prophylactic and responsive actions; our $18 trillion and counting government debt could finally cause the government spending bubble \u2014 the only thing propping up our economy \u2014 to pop, leading to all government spending halting overnight and the massive associated riots that would occur due to welfare, EBT and Medicaid/Medicare cards ceasing to work; and, the threat of Islamic terrorism and specifically ISIS, whose unmatched funding, training and brutality could fulfill their leaders\u2019 promise to shed the blood of millions of Americans.\n\nAdditionally, Obama\u2019s choice not to sufficiently secure the border must be taken into consideration with all of these possible emergencies, as open access to our country could only increase the liklihood of all three possible emergencies.\n\nNever in the history of our country have we faced so many destructive threats at the same time. America has also never had leadership that has failed to competently handle every single threat facing our country. If Obama isn\u2019t one of the most inept people to ever hold elected office, then his actions must be calculated to produce these results.\n\nObama knows he is unpopular with the military, therefore, he has had to find a different way to institute martial law \u2014 and that is through a \u201ccivilian national security force.\u201d On July 2, 2008 at a campaign stop, Obama made the following unscripted statement: \u201cWe cannot continue to rely on our military in order to achieve the national security objectives we\u2019ve set. We\u2019ve got to have a civilian national security force that\u2019s just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.\u201d\n\nPresident Obama\u2019s blackmail leverage over Republicans\n\nIn 2013 the United States spent $663.8 billion on the military, with personnel include 2.2 million people on active duty or in the reserves. America has local police forces, which could call in the National Guard, which could then call in the Department of Defense to protect the country in times of civil unrest. For what purpose, then, would a civilian security force funded with hundreds of billions of dollars and made up of millions of Americans be necessary?\n\nAnother worrying issue is that Obama has militarized almost every federal agency. In September of 2013, 70 federal agents in full body armor, carrying M-16s raided one person\u2019s gold mining operation in a tiny Alaska town. They were from the Environmental Protection Agency looking for violations of the Clean Air Act.\n\nAfter this incident it was found that Obama had created law enforcement branches in over 70 federal agencies. It is estimated that there are over 120,000 law enforcement agents in the federal government who are not part of traditional law enforcement branches \u2014 CIA, FBI, DEA, ATF, DHS, DOJ, and Treasury Dept.\n\nThese law enforcement branches Obama has created are not comprised of just one or two security guards. Obama has armed these agencies to the teeth. Maj. General Jerry Curry, a 40 year, decorated, military veteran, wrote an op-ed for The Daily Caller pointing out how, in addition to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administrations\u2019 purchase of 46,000 hollow point bullets, the Social Security Administration (SSA) bought 174,000 hollow point bullets.\n\nISIS in Paris: Obama\u2019s JV team kill 160+\n\nIn reaction to these purchases, Maj. Gen. Curry said, \u201cHollow point bullets are so lethal that the Geneva Convention does not allow their use on the battlefield in time of war. Hollow point bullets don\u2019t just stop or hurt people, they penetrate the body, spread out, fragment and cause maximum damage to the body\u2019s organs. Death often follows. Potentially each hollow nose bullet represents a dead American. If so, why would the U.S. government want the SSA to kill 174,000 of our citizens, even during a time of civil unrest? Or is the purpose to kill 174,000 of the nation\u2019s military and replace them with Department of Homeland Security (DHS) special security forces, forces loyal to the Administration, not to the Constitution?\u201d\n\nCurry goes on, \u201cIn the war in Iraq, our military forces expended approximately 70 million rounds per year. In March (of 2012) DHS ordered 750 million rounds of hollow point ammunition. It then turned around and ordered an additional 750 million rounds of miscellaneous bullets including some that are capable of penetrating walls. This is enough ammunition to empty five rounds into the body of every living American citizen.\u201d\n\nCurry\u2019s final point is something that every American should consider: \u201cObama is a deadly serious, persistent man. Once he focuses on an object, he pursues it to the end. What is his focus here? \u2026 I hope I\u2019m wrong, but something smells rotten. And If the Congress isn\u2019t going to do its duty and investigate this matter fully, the military will have to protect the Constitution, the nation, and our citizens.\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s pray that none of these matters fully materialize and Dr. Carson\u2019s ominous suggestion becomes nothing but an afterthought. However, those who understand Obama know not to put anything beyond his desire to, in Obama\u2019s own words, \u201cfundamentally transform America.\u201d\n\nThese next two years are his last chance.\n\nThis article originally published December 2014 \u2013 #FlashBackFriday", "article_metadata": {"description": "The idea is preposterous, except for this: Obama has done everything you'd expect to make it real.", "generator": "Powered by Visual Composer - drag and drop page builder for WordPress.", "author": "James Richard Edwards", "og": {"site_name": "Communities Digital News", "description": "The Obama administration has very quietly and subtly done many inexplicable things that could very well be precursors to the suspension of some, if not all, of Americans\u2019 constitutionally pro\u2026", "title": "Ben Carson: Can Obama use martial law to keep White House post 2016", "url": "http://www.commdiginews.com/politics-2/ben-carson-might-obama-cancel-the-2016-election-28523/", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://www.commdiginews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/obamacorupt_s640x427.jpg", "height": 427}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The idea is preposterous, except for this: Obama has done everything you'd expect to make it real.", "creator": "@TexasTeaAtty", "image": "http://www.commdiginews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/obamacorupt_s640x427-435x375.jpg", "title": "Ben Carson: Can Obama use martial law to keep White House post 2016", "site": "@commdiginews", "card": "summary"}, "propeller": "a20eada6e38f74d5c5bf31354ee9760c", "keywords": "obama,martial law,hollow point bullets,ben carson,barack obama,hollow-point bullet", "article": {"published_time": "2015-11-20T01:45:44+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-11-20T01:56:29+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Barack Obama, ben carson, Hollow-point bullet, martial law"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde47e\"", "article_summary": "Hollow point bullets don\u2019t just stop or hurt people, they penetrate the body, spread out, fragment and cause maximum damage to the body\u2019s organs.\nIn March (of 2012) DHS ordered 750 million rounds of hollow point ammunition.\nAfter this incident it was found that Obama had created law enforcement branches in over 70 federal agencies.\nThese law enforcement branches Obama has created are not comprised of just one or two security guards.\nCarson went on liberal radio host Alan Colmes\u2019 radio show and the discussion eventually came to whether or not Dr. Carson plans to run for president in 2016."}
