Mt. Mutombo rose in Africa on Saturday.

Former Denver star Dikembe Mutombo donned the classic rainbow Nuggets jersey and entered the NBA Africa exhibition game in Johannesburg, South Africa, drawing big cheers from the crowd.

He wasn’t the only old-timer to play. Houston Rockets legend Hakeem Olajuwon was also on the floor, showing shades of his “Dream Shake” days with a fadeaway jumper in the second quarter.
