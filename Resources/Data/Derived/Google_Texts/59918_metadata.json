The firm is pulling back from investments in key markets like oil, natural gas, coal and agriculture, the report added.\n\nVermillion is not the only firm to be laid low by the swoon in commodity prices. Assets under management at commodity hedge funds have tumbled 15 percent since 2012, according to data from HFR cited by The Journal.\n\nCommodities and raw materials has been among the most volatile sectors in the global economy this year, hurt largely by fears of slowing demand from China, which has a voracious appetite for industrial commodities like copper, iron, ore and coal. In July, copper prices swooned by more than 8 percent, their biggest loss since January.\n\nA representative from Carlyle told CNBC in an email that the firm is \"successfully re-positioning our commodities business,particularly in commodities finance, to capture an enormous global opportunity.\"\n\nThe full report can be found on the Wall Street Journal website.
