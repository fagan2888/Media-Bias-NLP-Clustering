Two men broke into an east Springs home, assaulted the occupants, then robbed them.

Police are now looking for the suspects, who were both disguised with ski masks during the break-in. The only descriptions the victims could give was that both suspects were short and thin, and dressed in dark clothes.

The break-in was reported just before 3:30 a.m. at the Parkridge Apartments on East Serendipity Circle. The victims told officers that after they were assaulted, they were held at gunpoint while the suspects stole money.

The victims suffered minor injuries during the robbery.
