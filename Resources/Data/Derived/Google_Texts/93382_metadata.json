Former U.S. Senator Rick Santorum and Former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina have also committed to take part in future installments later this spring.\n\nPerry told the group of approximately 65 people who gathered at the West Des Moines Marriott that the wanted to present an optimistic vision. He shared what his state, which represents the 13th largest economy in the world, had done to spur economic growth and prosperity. \u201cThese principles we put into practice will work anywhere,\u201d Perry stated.\n\nThe first principle he stated was to not overtax. He mentioned later in his remarks that the way to make sure people can see wage increases is to lower the corporate tax rate.\n\nThe second principle is to have a regulatory climate that is \u201cfair and predictable.\u201d\n\nThe third principle Perry said is tort reform. One change that reforming the legal system brought was an increase in licensed physicians in Texas. Perry said that Texas now has 35,000 more licensed physicians than there were in 2003. He stated access to healthcare has \u201cexploded.\u201d\n\nThe fourth principles Perry shared was a skilled workforce. He said that companies like Facebook and Ebay won\u2019t move into states that don\u2019t have the workforce to meet their criteria. He said Texas implemented accountable public school policies like testing to have a better idea where a student is at academically, and incentive-based pay for teachers. He stated that Texas now has the 2nd highest graduate rate in the country and the highest graduation rate among African-Americans and Hispanics.\n\n\u201cStates should be freed to make those decision for themselves to compete against other states,\u201d Perry explained.\n\nPerry shared that Texas the creation of 1.5 million new jobs between the end of 2007 to the end of 2014. He added that nationally the U.S. only saw 1.1 million new jobs created so the rest of the country lost 400,000 jobs.\n\nHe noted that to turn things around the nation needed men and women who respect and believe in the Constitution, in particular, the 10th Amendment which says powers not enumerated to the federal government are to be reserved for the states or the people.\n\n\u201cI happen to think that a Governor and legislature no matter what state it is will come up with a better way to deliver healthcare than Washington, DC,\u201d Perry said. \u201cI know that Governor Branstad and the legislature\u2026 and your parents and your teachers are a lot better place for the curriculum to be done for the kids of Iowa than from Washington, DC and this Common Core concept.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think it is impossible for the diversity that we have for this country\u2026 I mean these states are different. For them to be pushed into one-size-fits-all policies that come out of Washington, DC \u2013 I think that is impossible. Not only is it an impossibility to operate in an efficient and effective way. I think it just makes people unhappy,\u201d Perry added.\n\nQuoting the late Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis, Perry called the 50 states \u201claboratories of democracy.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe said states need to be left to experiment. He said from time to time there is going to be a state that fouls up, and messes up, and they\u2019re going to do some harm to their citizens, but they haven\u2019t destroyed the Republic. That is the power of the Constitution,\u201d Perry stated.\n\nPerry referred back to the principles he shared. \u201cThese principles will work anywhere you have men and women who are principled, disciplined, and allow people the freedom to make those decisions for themselves. That\u2019s the reason why I am optimistic about this country because we are only a few decisions on the economic side (and a change of leadership he added later) of seeing this country explode economically,\u201d Perry shared.\n\nPerry also discussed foreign policy saying threats to our security have grown with the background of the Obama administration \u201cleading from behind.\u201d He noted the rise of ISIS, alluded to Benghazi and Egypt, and reserved his strongest criticism for President Obama\u2019s handling of Iran.\n\n\u201cWe have an administration that I am concerned about that is negotiating with a country that certainly doesn\u2019t have our best interest at heart \u2013 negotiating with a country that is responsible or our Marines being killed in Beriut, responsible for weapons that killed our soldiers in Iraq, and a country that wants to have a nuclear capability,\u201d Perry explained.\n\nPerry said two powerful messages need to sent to Iran. \u201cUntil Iran stops supporting terrorists, stop funding terrorism whether it is Hezbollah or Hamas, that they will never, ever negotiate with the United States and they will never, ever \u2013 period \u2013 get a nuclear weapon. Never.\u201d\n\nPerry was unable to stay for questions from the audience as anticipated after his 28 minute long remarks due to another commitment afterwards.\n\nYou can watch his remarks below or here.", "article_metadata": {"shareaholic": {"site_name": "Caffeinated Thoughts", "language": "en-US", "url": "https://caffeinatedthoughts.com/2015/03/rick-perry-touts-texas-policies-federalism-to-dallas-county-republicans/", "article_author_name": "Shane Vander Hart", "image": "https://caffeinatedthoughts.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/IMG_27641-1024x768.jpg", "site_id": "965f58835b5900850067f65116487024", "article_published_time": "2015-03-20T22:16:16+00:00", "shareable_page": "true", "article_modified_time": "2016-05-25T11:32:47+00:00", "keywords": "dallas county republicans, economic policy, federalism, foreign policy, iowa caucus, iran, rick perry, election central", "wp_version": "7.7.1.0"}, "description": "Former Texas Governor Rick Perry highlighted Texas' economic record, called for the 10th Amendment to be respected and critiqued Obama's Iran policy.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Caffeinated Thoughts", "description": "Former Texas Governor Rick Perry highlighted Texas' economic record, called for the 10th Amendment to be respected and critiqued Obama's Iran policy.", "title": "Rick Perry Touts Texas Policies, Federalism to Dallas County Republicans | Caffeinated Thoughts", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://caffeinatedthoughts.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/IMG_27641-1024x768.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-03-20T17:50:09-05:00", "url": "https://caffeinatedthoughts.com/2015/03/rick-perry-touts-texas-policies-federalism-to-dallas-county-republicans/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Former Texas Governor Rick Perry highlighted Texas' economic record, called for the 10th Amendment to be respected and critiqued Obama's Iran policy.", "title": "Rick Perry Touts Texas Policies, Federalism to Dallas County Republicans | Caffeinated Thoughts", "image": "https://caffeinatedthoughts.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/IMG_27641.jpg", "creator": "@shanevanderhart", "site": "@CaffThoughts", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 259594777484510}, "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/CaffThoughts", "published_time": "2015-03-20T17:16:16-05:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/shanevanderhart", "section": "Election Central", "modified_time": "2015-03-20T17:50:09-05:00", "tag": "Rick Perry"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf6ec\"", "article_summary": "He stated access to healthcare has \u201cexploded.\u201dThe fourth principles Perry shared was a skilled workforce.\nPerry shared that Texas the creation of 1.5 million new jobs between the end of 2007 to the end of 2014.\n\u201cStates should be freed to make those decision for themselves to compete against other states,\u201d Perry explained.\n(West Des Moines, IA) Former Texas Governor Rick Perry visited West Des Moines yesterday to speak to Dallas County Republicans at another installment of their spring lecture series which has already included New Jersey Governor Chris Christie.\nPerry said that Texas now has 35,000 more licensed physicians than there were in 2003."}
