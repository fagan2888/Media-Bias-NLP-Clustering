Henrich will handle leadership and development in the area and supervise its Orlando team, which hired Janis Godlewski as account executive.\n\nCompleting immediate employment transitions for recent FDIC bank acquisitions has enabled Agility to be extremely responsive, quick-acting and efficient with such critical and timely transitions.

Agility also anticipates that many companies will need its assistance navigating the complications and compliance of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nFounded in 1995 by Michael Rolewicz, Agility Staffing, Inc.
