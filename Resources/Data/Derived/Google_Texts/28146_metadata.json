President Obama issued an executive order establishing the review board system in March 2011, but it had not been used before Mr. Mujahid\u2019s hearing last fall.\n\n\u201cBy consensus, the P.R.B. members found that continued law of war detention is no longer necessary to protect against a continuing significant threat to the United States and that Mujahid is therefore eligible for transfer subject to appropriate security and humane treatment conditions,\u201d the military said in a statement.\n\nThe panel did not say which country Mr. Mujahid should be transferred to, but it is generally understood that most Yemenis will ultimately be repatriated. Still, the change does not mean he is likely to leave anytime soon; 55 other Yemeni detainees have long been recommended for transfer if security conditions could be met, but remain stranded at Guant\u00e1namo because of instability in Yemen.\n\nDavid Remes, a lawyer for Mr. Mujahid, said Mr. Mujahid was \u201cdelighted\u201d by the board\u2019s decision.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cNow that he\u2019s been cleared, he should be transferred,\u201d Mr. Remes said. \u201cThe fact that he\u2019s a Yemeni should not hold him back.\u201d\n\nIn the latest setback for the Obama administration\u2019s hopes to winnow the population of low-level Yemeni detainees, a major terrorist attack on Dec. 5 on Yemen\u2019s Ministry of Defense by a Qaeda-affiliated insurgent group led to an indefinite delay in a trip to Yemen by a United Nations agency that had been planned for this month.\n\nThe agency has been working with the Yemeni government to develop a rehabilitation program for some prisoners in Yemen. American and Yemeni officials have separately discussed using the program to handle some Yemeni detainees from Guant\u00e1namo.\n\nThe Dec. 5 attack, in which at least 52 people were killed, is being cited by congressional critics of Mr. Obama\u2019s goal of closing the prison. The Pentagon is set to a deliver a classified briefing next week to the House Armed Services Committee about detainee matters, and congressional aides say questions about the implications of the attack on efforts to repatriate Yemenis are a top worry.\n\n\u201cI continue to be concerned about the security implications of transferring dangerous people to dangerous places like Yemen,\u201d said Representative Howard P. McKeon, Republican of California, the chairman of the committee, who also noted that Yemen had \u201ca history of mass prison breaks.\u201d\n\nAs lower-level detainees from other countries have left Guant\u00e1namo, Yemenis have become the largest proportion remaining, making up 87 of the 155 prisoners there. A few are high-level suspects designated for trial, while a task force in 2009 and 2010 designated about two dozen prisoners \u2014 including Mr. Mujahid \u2014 for continued detention without trial. But the bulk of the Yemenis were recommended for transfer if security conditions could be met, which has proved difficult.\n\nLast May, Mr. Obama recommitted his administration to moving lower-level prisoners, and he lifted a moratorium on Yemeni repatriations. Since then, 11 detainees have been transferred \u2014 more than had left in the previous two years \u2014 but none went to Yemen. Still, administration officials say they are actively reviewing the Yemenis\u2019 status on a case-by-case basis.\n\nOne official familiar with the effort said policy makers were considering several options. They include trying to persuade the Saudi government to take custody of several Yemeni detainees who have tribal or family ties in Saudi Arabia; finding other countries willing to resettle a Yemeni or two; and repatriating a particularly low-risk Yemeni to see how it goes.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe potential rehabilitation program, officials say, has raised a possible way to reduce the risk of repatriating larger numbers of the Yemenis. In a joint statement last August, Mr. Obama and Yemen\u2019s president, Abdu Rabbu Mansour Hadi, cited the Yemeni government\u2019s plans to \u201cestablish an extremist rehabilitation program to address the problem of violent extremism within Yemen, which could also facilitate the transfer of Yemeni detainees held at Guant\u00e1namo.\u201d\n\nAbout that same time, Yemen reached out to the United Nations Interregional Crime and Justice Research Institute, seeking help from its Disengagement and Rehabilitation of Violent Extremists and Terrorists initiative, diplomatic officials said.\n\nThe program, which was begun in 2012, has worked with Nigeria and other countries in the Sahel region of Africa, in Indonesia and in Tajikistan, among others. Its employees include Douglas Stone, a retired Marine general who was credited with successfully revamping American detention operations in Iraq, and later designed an overhaul of detention practices in Afghanistan.\n\nThe United Nations agency held meetings in Rome in August and in London in October with Yemeni officials and a group of potential donor nations \u2014 including the United States \u2014 that are already working in Yemen, diplomatic officials said. The consortium\u2019s planned visit to Yemen this month, which was postponed by the Dec. 5 attack, has not been rescheduled, the agency\u2019s director, Jonathan Lucas, said in a phone interview.\n\n\u201cWe have to wait for the security situation to improve for the U.N. to start operating missions to Yemen,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have any time frame at the moment.\u201d\n\nA person familiar with the agency\u2019s methods, who was not authorized to speak on its behalf, said its recommendations center on creating a secure prison center where detainees could undergo intensive, individualized assessments by psychologists, sociologists, religious leaders, family members and others.\n\nThe goal is to identify what motivated each prisoner to get involved in a terrorist or insurgent group \u2014 ideological commitment, peer pressure, a desire for adventure or money \u2014 and separate the more extreme inmates from the moderates. Intense counseling, with the help of family and community leaders, can significantly reduce the risk that the more moderate prisoners will participate in terrorist activities after their release, the person said.\n\nMr. Mujahid is the first of several Yemenis who had been designated for indefinite detention to be scheduled for Periodic Review Board hearings. A leaked 2008 threat assessment file said he was captured by Pakistan in December 2001 and was ranked as \u201chigh risk\u201d if released, portraying him as a \u201ccommitted jihadist\u201d and a likely bodyguard to Osama bin Laden.\n\nAn official familiar with the review of Mr. Mujahid\u2019s case said that the 2008 intelligence assessment was outdated.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20140109163343, "twitter": {"description": "A military panel has recommended transferring a Yemeni detainee in the first results of a long-delayed initiative to hold parole-like hearings at Guant\u00e1namo Bay, Cuba.", "title": "Panel Recommends Transferring Yemeni From Guant\u00e1namo", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/10/us/panel-recommends-transferring-yemeni-from-guantanamo.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000002641228"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "creator": "charlie_savage", "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_150_black.png", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/10/us/panel-recommends-transferring-yemeni-from-guantanamo.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000002641228", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/10/us/panel-recommends-transferring-yemeni-from-guantanamo.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "us", "hdl_p": "U.S. Panel Recommends Transferring Yemeni Detainee From Guant\u00e1namo", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/us/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "Jan. 9, 2014", "edt": "NewYork", "keywords": "Guantanamo Bay Naval Base (Cuba),Detainees,Mujahid  Mahmoud al,Yemen", "news_keywords": "Detainees,Yemen", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "Charlie Savage", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "per": "Mujahid, Mahmoud al", "byl": "By CHARLIE SAVAGE", "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "A military panel has recommended transferring a Yemeni detainee in the first results of a long-delayed initiative to hold parole-like hearings at Guant\u00e1namo Bay, Cuba.", "tom": "News", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "description": "A military panel has recommended transferring a Yemeni detainee in the first results of a long-delayed initiative to hold parole-like hearings at Guant\u00e1namo Bay, Cuba.", "CG": "us", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "Jan. 9, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "News", "article": {"author": "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/s/charlie_savage/index.html", "section_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/pages/national/index.html", "section": "U.S.", "modified": "2014-01-13", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/us/index.jsonp", "tag": "Yemen", "published": "2014-01-09", "section-taxonomy-id": "23FD6C8B-62D5-4CEA-A331-6C2A9A1223BE"}, "geo": "Yemen", "slug": "10gitmo", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20140113102320, "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/10/us/panel-recommends-transferring-yemeni-from-guantanamo.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_291_black.png", "type": "article", "description": "A military panel has recommended transferring a Yemeni detainee in the first results of a long-delayed initiative to hold parole-like hearings at Guant\u00e1namo Bay, Cuba.", "title": "Panel Recommends Transferring Yemeni From Guant\u00e1namo"}, "pdate": 20140109, "des": "Detainees", "articleid": 100000002641228, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "Panel Recommends Transferring Yemeni From Guant\u00e1namo", "PST": "News"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9e17\"", "article_summary": "David Remes, a lawyer for Mr. Mujahid, said Mr. Mujahid was \u201cdelighted\u201d by the board\u2019s decision.\nAmerican and Yemeni officials have separately discussed using the program to handle some Yemeni detainees from Guant\u00e1namo.\nThe panel did not say which country Mr. Mujahid should be transferred to, but it is generally understood that most Yemenis will ultimately be repatriated.\nThey include trying to persuade the Saudi government to take custody of several Yemeni detainees who have tribal or family ties in Saudi Arabia; finding other countries willing to resettle a Yemeni or two; and repatriating a particularly low-risk Yemeni to see how it goes.\nMr. Mujahid is the first of several Yemenis who had been designated for indefinite detention to be scheduled for Periodic Review Board hearings."}
