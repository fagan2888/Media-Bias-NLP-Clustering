High winds and gusts between 40 and 50 miles per hour Saturday caused power outages in the Louisville area through Sunday morning.

LG&E reported just 153 customers in Jefferson County – less than 1 percent of its customers in the county – were without power as of 11 a.m. Sunday.

Duke Energy reported 104 customers in Clark County and 31 in Floyd County were still affected Sunday morning.

Wind gusts peaked Saturday at 57 in Jefferson County, while counties across the river in Indiana saw gusts in the low 40s to mid-50s, according to the National Weather Service.

High winds loosened power lines and dropped them dangerously low over Interstate 265 in southwestern Metro Louisville Saturday, forcing police and firefighters to block the roadway in both directions between Bardstown Road and Billtown Road. The road was closed after reports poured in at 4:20 p.m. and Metrosafe dispatchers said there was no estimate on when the Gene Snyder would reopen.

The gusts also knocked out power to about 5,000 LG&E customers from Valley Station to LaGrange Saturday. The utility said that multiple outages affected Pleasure Ridge Park, St. Matthews and Prospect, mostly because of trees snapping and dropping on utility lines.

KU also reported Lexington, Georgetown, Elizabethtown and other east-central Kentucky communities were hit with scattered outages.
