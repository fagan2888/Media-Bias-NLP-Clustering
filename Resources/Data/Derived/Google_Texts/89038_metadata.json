I\u2019m just going to come right out and say it: This is quite possibly the best minute and a half of audio we\u2019ve ever come across \u2014 well, come across in a long time anyway. A massive brawl in Anchorage, Alaska, reportedly involving Sarah Palin\u2019s kids and her husband. It was sparked after someone pushed one of her daughters at a party....And now police have released audio of that interview. It does include some rather colorful language from Bristol. Here now is Bristol\u2019s recollection of how that night unfolded. So sit back and enjoy.\u201d\n\nThis year\u2019s winners were selected by a distinguished panel of radio talk show hosts, magazine editors, columnists, editorial writers, and expert media observers. The runner-up after Costello was longtime Newsweek correspondent Eleanor Clift, now a writer for The Daily Beast, who claimed Ambassador Chris Stevens\u2019 death was not a result of being murdered by terrorists but, rather, smoke inhalation:\n\n\u201cEvery media organization has investigated this [Benghazi] to death. This animates the right wing of the Republican Party. And I would like to point out that Ambassador [Chris] Stevens was not murdered. He died of smoke inhalation in the safe room in that CIA installation.\u201d\n\nSecond runner-up is MSNBC contributor Michael Eric Dyson who, in urging President Obama to go to Ferguson, Missouri, ludicrously compared him to Jesus Christ\n\n\u201cYou know, I\u2019m a Christian preacher, and God finally said, \u2018Look, I can\u2019t send nobody else. I got to go myself.\u2019 And I ain\u2019t saying that Obama is Jesus, but for many of his followers he is.\u201d\n\nMRC President Brent Bozell reacts to this year\u2019s winners:\n\n\u201cFor the liberal media, 2014 was a banner year\u2026 of failure. They celebrated violence against conservative women, downplayed the global terror threat, overlooked and suppressed news reports about the utter devastation ObamaCare wrought on our health care system, and peddled the race card as an explanation for any opposition to President Obama\u2019s lawlessness and failed policies. The Obama zombies in the liberal media did their best to cover for him combining hero worship with a bizarre and cultish \u2013 yet familiar \u2013 adherence to administration talking points all the while masquerading as objective news outlets. \u201cThis year\u2019s \u2018winner,\u2019 the repugnant and contemptible Carol Costello, exhibited conspicuous joy and giddiness over the assault of a young women that will not long be forgotten. While it\u2019s true that many would be hard-pressed to locate her show on their television, her infamous, hate-filled segment will be immortalized here for all to see what the liberal media is all about.\u201d\n\nThe winners were selected by a panel of 40 judges, including nationally syndicated columnist Cal Thomas, Wall Street Journal editorial board member James Taranto, nationally syndicated talk radio host Mark Levin, Fox News Channel news analyst and Washington Times Online Opinion Editor Monica Crowley, retired nationally syndicated talk radio host Neal Boortz, Editor of RedState Erick Erickson, Townhall.com News Editor Katie Pavlich, and Contributing Editor to National Review Quin Hillyer among many others.\n\nFor audio and video clips of the broadcast quotes, to access full quotes, or see winners and runners up, please visit www.MRC.org.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "NewsBusters", "description": "The Media Research Center (MRC) is proud to announce the Worst of the Worst of 2014: The 27th Annual Awards for the Year\u2019s Worst Reporting, with CNN anchor Carol Costello taking home the \u201cQuote of the Year\u201d honor for telling her viewers to enjoy listening to former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin\u2019s daughter, Bristol, get attacked and berated:", "title": "CNN Anchor Carol Costello's Celebration of Violence Against Palin's Family Wins Quote of the Year", "url": "http://social.newsbusters.org/blogs/nb-staff/2014/12/18/cnn-anchor-carol-costellos-celebration-violence-against-palins-family-wins", "image": "http://cdn.newsbusters.org/images/DamnConservatives[1].JPG", "video": {"width": 640, "type": "text/html", "height": 360}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The Media Research Center (MRC) is proud to announce the Worst of the Worst of 2014: The 27th Annual Awards for the Year\u2019s Worst Reporting, with CNN anchor Carol Costello taking home the \u201cQuote of the Year\u201d honor for telling her viewers to enjoy listening to former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin\u2019s daughter, Bristol, get attacked and berated:", "title": "CNN Host Carol Costello's Palin Bash Wins Our Worst Quote of the Year", "url": "http://newsbusters.org/blogs/nb-staff/2014/12/18/cnn-anchor-carol-costellos-celebration-violence-against-palins-family-wins", "image": "http://cdn.newsbusters.org/images/DamnConservatives[1].JPG", "creator": "@TimJGraham", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "description": "The Media Research Center (MRC) is proud to announce the Worst of the Worst of 2014: The 27th Annual Awards for the Year\u2019s Worst Reporting, with CNN anchor Carol Costello taking home the \u201cQuote of the Year\u201d honor for telling her viewers to enjoy listening to former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin\u2019s daughter, Bristol, get attacked and berated:", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "So sit back and enjoy.\u201dThis year\u2019s winners were selected by a distinguished panel of radio talk show hosts, magazine editors, columnists, editorial writers, and expert media observers.\nFor audio and video clips of the broadcast quotes, to access full quotes, or see winners and runners up, please visit www.MRC.org.\nIt was sparked after someone pushed one of her daughters at a party....And now police have released audio of that interview.\nA massive brawl in Anchorage, Alaska, reportedly involving Sarah Palin\u2019s kids and her husband.\n\u201cThis year\u2019s \u2018winner,\u2019 the repugnant and contemptible Carol Costello, exhibited conspicuous joy and giddiness over the assault of a young women that will not long be forgotten."}
