Where do you go? . . . The challenge of finding health care on the North Olympic Peninsula\" \u2014 http://www.peninsuladailynews.com/article/20150118/NEWS/301189977 a medical home \u2014 a primary care doctor \u2014 consider yourself fortunate.Across the North Olympic Peninsula, people are searching for that home.They're phoning clinics and doctors' offices in hopes of making just one appointment.And many, newly insured via the federal Affordable Care Act, are after health care they've long done without.\u201cWe have dozens of people a day calling, wanting to register,\u201d said Larri Ann Mishko, medical director at Sequim's Jamestown Family Health Clinic.Trouble is, those callers will wait months before getting in to see a doctor, nurse practitioner or physician's assistant.\u201cThe staff feels horrible,\u201d Mishko said. Though they're making appointments for people who registered last spring, they must tell those who phone the clinic now to try again after the first day of 2015.At Family Medicine of Port Angeles, about 250 calls come in weekly, clinic administrator Karen Paulsen estimated.Some ask her if she can squeeze them in somewhere, somehow.The answer is no.And Family Medicine doesn't keep a waiting list.Doctors there each have some 1,500 patients on their rolls already.At least one caller wept when told Family Medicine can take no more.Back in Sequim, Linda Klinefelter takes these calls, too.People know her from her work as Olympic Medical Cancer Center's patient navigator.She's retired now but still knows the health care landscape.She suggests the Jamestown clinic, and \u201cif worse comes to worst, you can go to Port Townsend.\u201dAt Jefferson Healthcare's clinics there, a few primary care doctors are taking new patients.But Jefferson County faces a looming crisis much like Clallam County's: Family doctors are leaving or retiring, and their replacements are tough to find.\u201cWe are actively recruiting,\u201d said Mike Glenn, Jefferson Healthcare CEO (and former CEO at Olympic Medical Center in Port Angeles.)Glenn adds that he hopes to bring one or two new practitioners to his rural clinics in the coming six months.It may not make those lacking a doctor feel better, but much of rural America is dealing with this scarcity.Small-town clinics are struggling to attract primary care doctors, and \u201cI don't know that I'm aware of a community that has this figured out,\u201d Glenn added.As the population grows older, demand for health care rises, even as old-fashioned family doctors retire.Their young successors don't come to rural places; instead, they head to urban teaching hospitals for their training.At Family Medicine in Port Angeles, founder Dr. Stanley Garlick retired last winter; Dr. Jennifer Brown, another of the clinic's doctors, moved away.Family Medicine also lost Dr. Bill Hennessey, a longtime family physician, when he died of cancer last year.At the Jamestown clinic, Dr. Esther Kittle left some months ago.She was Klinefelter's doctor, though Klinefelter didn't learn of her departure until she called to schedule an annual checkup.She was able, fortunately, to make an appointment with one of Jamestown's nurse practitioners.\u201cI was already an established patient,\u201d Klinefelter said.\u201cWhat were they going to do, kick me to the curb?\u201dShe feels for her contemporaries who can't get in to see anyone \u2014 or are rushed through their appointments.Clallam and Jefferson counties' median age is older than that of Washington state as a whole.In Clallam, it's about 55; in Jefferson, it's 50; while the state median is 38, according to a 2012 report by Clallam County Health & Human Services.Rural communities tend to have a higher demand for health care, said Tom Locke, the public health officer for Clallam and Jefferson counties.From the West End of Clallam County to unincorporated Chimacum, he sees plenty of need \u2014 and a supply of doctors that hasn't kept up.Tribal health clinics in Sequim, the West End and on the Lower Elwha Klallam reservation provide care for their members, Locke said.But for those who are not enrolled members, the waits can be long.In this rural place, \u201cwe're older, sicker and poorer,\u201d he added.More people are insured thanks to the Affordable Care Act, \u201cand this is a great thing,\u201d Locke said, \u201cbut no way can we expand the primary care workforce rapidly.\u201dFollowing a concerted effort by its recruitment team, Olympic Medical Center has been able to attract two new providers to its Sequim Primary Care clinic. And Drs. Pallavi Sindhu and Eric Waddington are taking new patients \u2014 in the face of fierce demand.The waiting list for the Olympic Medical Physicians clinics swelled to 1,200 earlier this year, and while people on the list are getting in, their appointments are spread out over several months.\u201cIn the meantime, the Olympic Medical Physicians Walk-In Clinic in Sequim is an excellent resource,\u201d said Dr. Rebecca Corley, Olympic's chief physician officer.This recruitment business is \u201ca huge effort,\u201d Corley said.Olympic Medical Physicians \u2014 and the patients of Clallam County \u2014 must compete of course with doctor salaries across the country.To that end, the salary Olympic offers a family doctor the first year is $205,000; it dips to $168,000 the second year.Not bad, especially by Clallam standards. But family physicians are paid considerably less than their colleagues in the specialties.The median annual salary for a gastroenterologist in the Western United States, for example, is $463,791, according to a Medical Group Management Association (www.mgma.com) report on physician compensation.For a urologist, it's $414,380 a year.The median pay for a family doctor in the West, according to the MGMA report, is $202,740.If OMC seems to pay well, the numbers fall below the median.In April, the hospital's board of commissioners approved a contract for Dr. Dale Russell, a urologist, with a salary of $304,472.Also last spring, the commissioners approved the hiring of Dr. Aya Sultan, an obstetrician-gynecologist, with a $15,000 starting bonus, a four-year retention incentive of $15,000 and an annual salary of $237,993.In June, medical oncologist Marion Chirayath came on board at OMC for $341,676 per year.Doctors go into the job market with formidable student loan debt, which makes particular specialties that much more attractive, said Family Medicine's Dr. Mike Maxwell.He and Dr. Rob Epstein are primary care veterans and do their recruiting by word of mouth across the region.\u201cWe love what we do,\u201d said Maxwell. \u201cWe just wish more [doctors] wanted to do it with us.\u201dRecruitment hasn't gone so well lately.The clinic came close to negotiating a contract with a new doctor, but then that practitioner chose to go elsewhere.\u201cWe're looking for people who want to be in a rural community. The bottom line is that there are relatively few,\u201d Epstein said.A solution could come in what's called a teaching health center, or THC in clinician parlance.With this model, a clinic would grow its own family doctors by training them during their three-year residencies.Nationwide, doctors tend to stay in the communities where they were trained, said Epstein.Clallam County badly needs a THC, and Family Medicine \u201cwould be a great one,\u201d he added.Democratic U.S. Sen. Patty Murray, D-Seattle, has introduced a bill to fund new THCs in underserved places: NYC's Harlem instead of midtown Manhattan; Port Angeles instead of Seattle.As they wait for Murray's bill to move through Congress, family doctors on the North Olympic Peninsula work longer hours and provide a much wider variety of care than their urban counterparts.\u201cThe variety is what makes it interesting,\u201d said Epstein, who added that he and his colleagues at Family Medicine do it all, just about, from delivering twins to caring for elderly diabetics.Dr. Jerry Oakes, head of OMC's recruiting team and a family doctor himself, is acutely aware of his community's shortage.Oakes is the son of Dr. Roger Oakes, who practiced family medicine in Port Angeles for decades before his retirement in 2011.The younger Oakes moved back here in 2005 after finishing his residency in Boise, Idaho. He has since built a patient roll of 1,300, last time he looked.Dr. Margaret Bangs, a Port Angeles family doctor in private practice, has been taking about five calls a day from people hoping she'll take them on.She's added some hours to her workweek but emphasized that she receives more queries than she could ever respond to.\u201cI absolutely love my patients. I love listening to them,\u201d Bangs said. But \u201cit takes all the time you have\u201d to care for the existing patients without adding new ones.\u201cThe nation needs to educate more doctors,\u201d and not just in medical schools, Bangs said.She hopes to see doctors, nurse practitioners and physician's assistants do their post-graduate training in communities such as hers.Then Bangs spoke of other ways to address the problem, ways that have little to do with the traditional clinic model \u2014 and everything to do with treating one's own body well: a good diet, exercise and stress management.All are effective means of primary care.\u201cAs a society, we need to be teaching people to take better care of themselves,\u201d Bangs said.________Features Editor Diane Urbani de la Paz can be reached at 360-452-2345, ext. 5062, or at diane.urbani@peninsuladailynews.com", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "port angeles newspaper, sequim newspaper, port townsend newspaper, olympic peninsula newspaper, daily news, port angeles classifieds, sequim classifieds, port townsend classifieds, local weather, local news, olympic peninsula obituaries, port angeles obituaries, sequim obituaries, port townsend obituaries,pdn,port angeles,sequim,port townsend,olympic peninsula", "og": {"url": "http://www.peninsuladailynews.com/article/20141026/NEWS/310269997", "type": "article", "image": "http://www.peninsuladailynews.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/bilde?Site=PT&Date=20141026&Category=NEWS&ArtNo=310269997&Ref=AR", "site_name": "Peninsula Daily News", "title": "North Olympic Peninsula faces its doctor shortage"}, "fb": {"admins": 100002304548680, "app_id": 224084277650041}, "description": "Your #1 News Source for the Olympic Peninsula, Port Angeles, Sequim, Port Townsend and beyond.", "news_keywords": "Unmetered,"}, "article_summary": "North Olympic Peninsula faces its doctor shortageBy Diane Urbani de la PazPeninsula Daily News\u2014 See our Jan. 18, 2015, followup story, \"No doctor?\nRob Epstein are primary care veterans and do their recruiting by word of mouth across the region.\u201cWe love what we do,\u201d said Maxwell.\nMargaret Bangs, a Port Angeles family doctor in private practice, has been taking about five calls a day from people hoping she'll take them on.She's added some hours to her workweek but emphasized that she receives more queries than she could ever respond to.\u201cI absolutely love my patients.\nHe has since built a patient roll of 1,300, last time he looked.Dr.\nWhere do you go?"}
