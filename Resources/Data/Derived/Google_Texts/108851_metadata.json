And with a series of price hikes and service cuts plaguing the president\u2019s healthcare overhaul in recent months, a top Republican is predicting that Obamacare critics won\u2019t have to wait much longer to witness its self-destruction.\n\nAccording to Wyoming Sen. John Barrasso, Obamacare will likely fall apart completely within the next year. He made the prediction in a Washington Times op-ed published Sunday, just as the latest open enrollment period for the government-managed healthcare scheme began.\n\n\u201cUnless something dramatic happens, this may be the year of the health care law\u2019s collapse,\u201d Barrasso wrote. \u201cPrices keep rising and service keeps fading. It should not surprise the administration that people are not signing up.\u201d\n\nBarrasso predicted that Americans are going to suffer a bit of sticker shock if they log into the healthcare exchange this year. More shocking, he said, will be how little healthcare they\u2019re able to get at such high prices.\n\n\u201cPremiums are jumping by double digits in many states. In Alaska, premiums will be nearly 40 percent higher next year,\u201d he wrote. \u201cPeople buying insurance on the Minnesota exchange will pay anywhere from 14 to 49 percent more.\n\n\u201cPremiums are just one part of the high-cost story,\u201d the lawmaker continued. \u201cMany plans are raising deductibles, co-pays, and other out-of-pocket costs.\u201d\n\nTo highlight Obamacare\u2019s lack of options for patients, Barrasso cited a Kaiser Family Foundation analysis which described how users in some states can\u2019t even find Obamacare providers.\n\n\u201cPeople living in 14 of Nevada\u2019s 16 counties will have only one or two companies to pick from,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIn Wyoming, with the failure of WINHealth, residents will have only one option.\u201d\n\nThe Obamacare collapse has been inevitable for some time, as co-ops throughout the nation have struggled constantly to remain solvent or simply shut their doors for good.\n\nAs we noted late last month:\n\nNine Obamacare co-ops have failed. Billions of dollars in federal-to-state Obamacare subsidies are unaccounted for. The White House is already trying to temper expectations that enrollment for 2016 will come anywhere near its earlier projections. And now we have a state where lawmakers are proposing a single-payer replacement for Obamacare \u2014 something many early critics predicted, well before the Affordable Care Act was ever put to Congress for a vote. Colorado\u2019s Obamacare exchange is poised to become the latest in a growing succession of state-run healthcare exchanges to shut down altogether. And progressive lawmakers there have joined with a citizen-backed campaign in floating a ballot initiative, Initiative 20, that would establish a statewide payer plan for residents\u2019 medical care \u2014 rendering the Obamacare exchange obsolete.\n\nFor now, the Obama administration is simply working to lower Obamacare expectations to make the healthcare disaster look less like a total failure. But as things get worse for Obamacare consumers and providers, you can bet that pretty soon all 50 states will have worked out a plan to get out from under the president\u2019s healthcare scheme.", "article_metadata": {"projectnami": {"version": "1.3.3"}, "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Personal Liberty\u00ae", "description": "With a series of price hikes and service cuts plaguing the president's healthcare overhaul in recent months, a top Republican is predicting that Obamacare critics won't have to wait much longer to witness its self-destruction.", "title": "Obamacare may not survive the year", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://plnami.blob.core.windows.net/media/2013/10/healthcare1003_image.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-11-03T14:00:51+00:00", "url": "http://personalliberty.com/obamacare-may-not-survive-the-year/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "https://plnami.blob.core.windows.net/media/2013/10/healthcare1003_image.jpg", "description": "With a series of price hikes and service cuts plaguing the president's healthcare overhaul in recent months, a top Republican is predicting that Obamacare critics won't have to wait much longer to witness its self-destruction.", "card": "summary", "title": "Obamacare may not survive the year"}, "description": "With a series of price hikes and service cuts plaguing the president's healthcare overhaul in recent months, a top Republican is predicting that Obamacare critics won't have to wait much longer to witness its self-destruction.", "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 135282966636750}, "article": {"section": "Dome Watch", "tag": "Obamacare", "published_time": "2015-11-02T15:18:54+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-11-03T14:00:51+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "bvYDjX4XBto8stfZA3uAxLxNaRlmJGvc5BQnIbK_wQo", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Affordable Care Act, Personal Liberty, Initiative 20, Sam Rolley, John Barrasso, Health Insurance, Barrasso, Obamacare"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2657\"", "article_summary": "According to Wyoming Sen.
