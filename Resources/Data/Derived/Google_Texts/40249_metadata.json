Thirty percent of the co-ops designated to administer the system have gone under. Costs are increasing 40% in some states. Adding undocumented \u2013 meaning illegal \u2013 workers will hasten its inevitable downfall.I don\u2019t think illegal workers should be allowed any benefits. If they\u2019re legally employed, paying taxes and premiums into the system, they should have the same health benefits any other employee has.The ACA was destined for failure from the beginning. It was designed to offer more services to more people for a lower premium with no regard to insurable underwriting.\u201d\u201cUndocumented workers shouldn\u2019t be allowed to buy insurance through the state or federal government exchanges. Much of the current vetting that takes place is geared to ensuring legal presence. This is a safeguard protecting American taxpayers and healthcare consumers, as well as those who are legally present. Our healthcare system is already bowing under the cost of overzealous distribution of benefits.Undocumented workers have access to employer coverage, government clinics, emergency rooms and insurance direct through the carrier. They don\u2019t have the burden of the insurance mandate and penalty; this is a leg up for them. First, do no harm.\u201d\u201cThe Congressional Budget Office estimates the cost of the Obamacare subsidies to be around $1.4 billion per year for legal citizens. We\u2019re spending more than $4 billion a year on medical care for another 11 million undocumented aliens.Extending subsidies to undocumented aliens should be done only as part of a comprehensive overhaul of immigration laws, the welfare system and how immigrants can become citizens. Stop the flow of illegals; have a welfare system that helps people become independent rather than supporting them indefinitely; and make it easier to become a citizen, pay taxes and help pay for the healthcare system they want to use.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.ibamag.com/features/should-the-aca-be-applied-to-undocumented-workers-28595.aspx", "image": {"width": 200, "identifier": "http://www.ibamag.com/files/image/AffordableCareActBenefits.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "height": 200}, "site_name": "Insurance Business", "description": "The Affordable Care Act continues to be debated \u2013 and now some wonder if it should be extended to undocumented workers", "title": "Should the ACA be applied to undocumented workers?"}, "twitter": {"description": "The Affordable Care Act continues to be debated \u2013 and now some wonder if it should be extended to undocumented workers", "title": "Should the ACA be applied to undocumented workers?", "url": "http://www.ibamag.com/features/should-the-aca-be-applied-to-undocumented-workers-28595.aspx", "image": "http://www.ibamag.com/files/image/AffordableCareActBenefits.jpg", "site": "@InsuranceBizUS", "card": "summary"}, "description": "The Affordable Care Act continues to be debated \u2013 and now some wonder if it should be extended to undocumented workers", "author": "Insurance Business"}, "article_summary": "Adding undocumented \u2013 meaning illegal \u2013 workers will hasten its inevitable downfall.I don\u2019t think illegal workers should be allowed any benefits.\nThree industry insiders give their views on this contentious issue.\u201cThe ACA is already broken from the insurance perspective.\nOur healthcare system is already bowing under the cost of overzealous distribution of benefits.Undocumented workers have access to employer coverage, government clinics, emergency rooms and insurance direct through the carrier.\nWe\u2019re spending more than $4 billion a year on medical care for another 11 million undocumented aliens.Extending subsidies to undocumented aliens should be done only as part of a comprehensive overhaul of immigration laws, the welfare system and how immigrants can become citizens.\nIf they\u2019re legally employed, paying taxes and premiums into the system, they should have the same health benefits any other employee has.The ACA was destined for failure from the beginning."}
