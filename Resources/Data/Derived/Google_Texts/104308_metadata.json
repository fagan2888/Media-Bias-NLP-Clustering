While leverage levels today for middle-market M&A are at 2007 levels, the current 30- to 60-day LIBOR rates are at 0.5 percent, compared to 4.5 percent in 2007.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got an awful lot of room before we have real challenges,\u201d Brackett says. \u201cWe feel very comfortable that today\u2019s capital structures anticipate and can digest a meaningful increase in interest rates.\u201d\n\nThe possibility of the Fed raising rates has been talked about for two years, and lenders have been building cushions into their financing models to anticipate possible rate increases over time. For Alcentra Capital Corp., for example, which uses a LIBOR-plus floating rate, a LIBOR floor of 50 basis points was already figured in to its rates, says Karin (McKittrick) Kovacic, a vice president at Alcentra.\n\nEven if the benchmark interest rates were to rise dramatically, they would have to reach the 5 percent or above range to be really scary, Brackett says. The concern with a jump in rates would be the factors behind such an increase, which would likely be inflationary pressures. But inflationary pressures aren\u2019t anticipated as long as the economy continues to grow slowly and the Fed continues its gradual approach.\n\nFor the lower middle market, the Fed hike will have little, if any, effect on M&A in 2016, says Tricia Marks, managing director of Madison Capital Funding. Jeri Harman, CEO of Avante Mezzanine Partners, says it will take a larger rate Fed hike --possibly a full point\u2014before the debt markets, and leverage availability and valuations in the middle- and lower-middle markets, are affected.\n\n\u201cI think the real likelihood is that some combination of rate hike, along with a general softening of the economy is what it would take to have a real impact on the debt markets and the M&A markets,\u201d says Harman, whose firm is one of the most active middle-market lenders. Worries of a modest recession would put more stress on companies and their revenues.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a long-term concern. I think a small hike in the short term, given the amount of capital chasing deals, isn\u2019t going to change things, at least in the lower and mid-market,\u201d she says.\n\nIf the Fed hike is cited as an issue during deal negotiations, then it\u2019s probably a signal of bigger problems, Alcentra\u2019s Kovacic says.\n\n\u201cIf it\u2019s 25 or 50 basis points that\u2019s going to affect a deal, then I think we\u2019re not focused on the right things. Hopefully that\u2019s not the case,\u201d Kovacic says. \u201cIf it\u2019s quarter after quarter after quarter after quarter and now you\u2019re talking about a full percentage point, now you\u2019re going to have to look at things a bit differently.\u201d\n\nFor more information on related topics, visit the following:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.themiddlemarket.com/news/financial_services/federal-reserve-interest-rate-hike-expected-to-make-minimal-impact-259424-1.html", "image": "http://cdn.themiddlemarket.com/media/newspics/fedreserve.jpeg", "site_name": "Mergers & Acquisitions, Latest News", "title": "Federal Reserve Interest Rate Hike Expected to Make Minimal Impact on the Middle Market"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1e42\"", "article_summary": "Federal Reserve Interest Rate Hike Expected to Make Minimal Impact on the Middle MarketAntares Capital's David Brackett, Avante\u0092s Jeri Harman and others say interest rates will have to climb much higher to make a difference in dealmakingThe Federal Reserve\u2019s move to raise its benchmark interest rate for the first time in nearly 10 years isn\u2019t expected to have much of an effect on middle-market M&A activity, but subsequent rate hikes could.\nIf the Fed hike is cited as an issue during deal negotiations, then it\u2019s probably a signal of bigger problems, Alcentra\u2019s Kovacic says.\nEven if the benchmark interest rates were to rise dramatically, they would have to reach the 5 percent or above range to be really scary, Brackett says.\nFor the lower middle market, the Fed hike will have little, if any, effect on M&A in 2016, says Tricia Marks, managing director of Madison Capital Funding.\n\u201cIf it\u2019s quarter after quarter after quarter after quarter and now you\u2019re talking about a full percentage point, now you\u2019re going to have to look at things a bit differently.\u201dFor more information on related topics, visit the following:"}
