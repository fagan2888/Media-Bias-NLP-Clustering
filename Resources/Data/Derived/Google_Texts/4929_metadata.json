Rissing, a professor at Brown University, and Emilio J. Castilla, a professor at MIT\u2019s Sloan School of Management, studied applications for labor certification, an essential first step in obtaining a Green Card. They looked at every application, either granted or denied, over a period of 40 months. Among other things, after controlling for variables including salary, industry, job title, location, and prior visa history, they determined that applicants from Asian countries were more likely to be approved than applicants from Latin America.\n\nIn an email, Rissing noted that in their analysis, \u201cApplications describing Asian immigrants are approved 90.5 percent of the time, while 66.8 percent of applications describing Latin American immigrants are approved.\u201d\n\nOn average, he said, \u201cApplications describing Asian immigrants are 13.3 percent more likely to be approved, while applications describing Latin American immigrants are 23 percent less likely to be approved, relative to Canadian immigrants (our reference category in both instances), all else equal.\u201d\n\nRissing and Castilla don\u2019t suggest that the discrimination is either intentional on the part of the agents reviewing applications or a matter of policy. The problem appears to be that the agents making the decision are doing so based on limited information. The agents who review the labor certification applications are not required to review an applicant\u2019s entire file. This, according to the researchers, may encourage them to take unconscious shortcuts.\n\nRelated: Obama May Have Tied GOP\u2019s Hands on Immigration\n\nImmigration officials conduct irregular audits of the application process, in which an agent who receives a more complete file considers applications a second time.\n\n\u201cWhen applications are audited, and reviewed with detailed employment-relevant information, we don't observe statistically significant differences among applications describing immigrant workers from different world regions,\u201d Rissing said.\n\nIn other words, when immigration officials are given complete file to work from, the bias disappears.\n\nThe researchers say the disparity may be based on unconscious biases. They cite existing research that shows Americans, in general, tend to view Asians as more competent and Latin Americans as less competent.\n\nRelated: GOP Leaders Grope for Solution on Immigration Action\n\n\u201cEvery year, tens of thousands of foreign immigrants seek jobs in this country and government agents\u2014who are tasked with evaluating the qualifications of those prospective workers\u2014play a major role in the hiring process,\u201d said Rissing in a press release. \u201cOur research shows that despite laws that have been on the books for decades forbidding discrimination on the basis of nationality, government agents\u2019 labor certification approvals depend a great deal on the job candidate\u2019s citizenship.\u201d\n\nRissing and Castillo suggest that the problem might be solved if immigration agents were provided applicants\u2019 full files from the start. Alternatively, they suggested, applications could be scrubbed of information identifying an applicant\u2019s country of origin, name, and other information unrelated to their ability to perform a job, but which might give the agent a sense of what country they are from.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "A study of more than four years of applications for a preliminary status required to gain permanent legal U.S. residence suggests that the system is biased in favor of applicants from Asian countries and against Latinos.", "title": "Green Card Study Shows Bias for Asians Over Latinos", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2014/11/23/Green-Card-Study-Shows-Bias-Asians-Over-Latinos", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/02112014_Immigration_Baby.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2014/11/23/Green-Card-Study-Shows-Bias-Asians-Over-Latinos", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/02112014_Immigration_Baby.jpg", "title": "The Fiscal Times", "card": "summary", "creator": "@rrgarver"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "A study of more than four years of applications for a preliminary status required to gain permanent legal U.S. residence suggests that the system is biased in favor of applicants from Asian countries and against Latinos.", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "They cite existing research that shows Americans, in general, tend to view Asians as more competent and Latin Americans as less competent.\n\u201cWhen applications are audited, and reviewed with detailed employment-relevant information, we don't observe statistically significant differences among applications describing immigrant workers from different world regions,\u201d Rissing said.\nIn other words, when immigration officials are given complete file to work from, the bias disappears.\nThe agents who review the labor certification applications are not required to review an applicant\u2019s entire file.\nThe problem appears to be that the agents making the decision are doing so based on limited information."}
