(AP Photo/Cliff Owen)\n\nCOLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) \u2014 The pitch for health care coverage is being made at nail salons, pizzerias, mosques and even bars.\n\nAs the second enrollment period under President Barack Obama\u2019s health care law begins, advocates are employing new tactics and expanding old ones to reach people who need insurance. Some groups are targeting populations they believe slipped through the cracks during the last enrollment period.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had great success at laundromats,\u201d said Robin Stockton, the navigator program director for the Center for Family Services, a nonprofit based in Camden, New Jersey.\n\nThe informal chat between wash-and-dry cycles can pique interest and lead some customers to call their hotline for more information, she said.\n\n\u201cTypically,\u201d she said, \u201cthe question you get back is: \u2018Is this that Obamacare thing?'\u201d\n\nOpen enrollment started Saturday and runs until Feb. 15. The HealthCare.gov website, where people can sign up and search for coverage, appeared to be running smoothly Saturday.\n\nHealth and Human Services Secretary Sylvia M. Burwell tweeted that the website opened shortly after 1 a.m., with more than 23,000 people submitting applications within the first eight hours. She said 1.2 million unique visitors looked at coverage using the site\u2019s window-shopping tool in the last week.\n\nIn Washington state, though, the health care exchange shut down after the first few hours of open enrollment as state officials and software engineers tried to resolve a problem with tax credit calculations.\n\nThe Obama administration aims to have 9.1 million paying customers enrolled in 2015. That\u2019s well below the 13 million that the Congressional Budget Office had projected.\n\nIn Philadelphia, Enroll America organizer Neil Rickett is armed with a list of 500 bars and restaurants as he makes his way through downtown, popping in and out of eateries. He approaches bartenders, wait staff and other service industry workers whose high turnover and odd hours often result in a lack of health coverage. He gets workers\u2019 contact information and sometimes schedules appointments to meet with them.\n\n\u201cBy going to them, we\u2019re upping our chance of getting the people we missed or didn\u2019t get enrolled last time,\u201d Rickett said.\n\nIn New Jersey, Stockton\u2019s nonprofit is among the community-based groups guiding people through the enrollment process. When they aren\u2019t taking appointments, the 17 navigators take their enrollment message on the road.\n\nThe helpers set up tables of brochures at festivals and malls. They make cold calls to pizza parlors, Chinese restaurants and other small businesses where they sometimes post information on bulletin boards. And with encrypted tablets and mobile offices, they have signed people up for coverage at churches, synagogues, mosques and a Buddhist temple.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re very flexible about the times that we can go out and make it convenient,\u201d Stockton said.\n\nThe organization\u2019s contact information in a newspaper caught the attention of freelance writer Susan Van Dongen Grigsby, who has COBRA coverage through her husband\u2019s former employer, though it expires next year.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to find myself without any coverage a few months from now,\u201d said Van Dongen Grigsby, 55, of Bordentown, New Jersey.\n\nChanging insurance has been on her mind since her husband retired in 2012. She pays $689 a month and hopes to find a cheaper plan. She said that she resisted the marketplace last year because she liked her COBRA coverage and that hearing horror stories about the website didn\u2019t help.\n\n\u201cI just would like someone walk to me through it and see what the options are,\u201d said Van Dongen Grigsby, who has an appointment this month with Stockton\u2019s group.\n\nOne organization in northeast Ohio plans to host information sessions with salon owners and their employees to help enroll Asian-Americans in coverage.\n\nCathy Vue, an assistant manager of Asian Services in Action Inc., said the organization also is putting together a free calendar for Asian groups that will include Affordable Care Act information in their native language. Each page of the 12-month calendar will feature a picture of a community member \u2014 Nepali, Korean, Hmong, Burmese \u2014 wearing native clothing.\n\n\u201cThis is kind of a way that we\u2019re hoping will get the community involved,\u201d Vue said. \u201cA lot of times they feel invisible so to have that visibility, I think, is really powerful.\u201d\n\nWord of mouth from a client led personal trainer Arthur Hunter to seek enrollment help from The Voice of Your Customer, a minority-owned business in Cincinnati that has counselors assisting with sign-ups. Hunter has health insurance through his wife\u2019s employer, though the two are getting a divorce. He hoped to get his coverage lined up Saturday.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to have a day go by without having it,\u201d said Hunter, 47. \u201cHealth and fitness is so important to me \u2014 that for me, one of the most important things is to have that health care coverage.\u201d\n\nAnne Filipic, president of Enroll America, said reaching the uninsured naturally will get harder from year to year as more people get coverage. Part of the challenge this period, she said, is for organizers not just to connect people to health insurance but also to make sure those enrolled keep their coverage and make any necessary updates.\n\n\u201cThis year, we really have to be able to walk and chew gum at the same time,\u201d Filipic said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) \u2014 The pitch for health care coverage is being made at nail salons, pizzerias, mosques and even bars.
