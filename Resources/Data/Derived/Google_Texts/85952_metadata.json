Healthcare in a lot of communities has drifted far from that.\u201d Mr. Oostra told the crowd that Ohio \u201cis not a low-cost state\u201d when it comes to healthcare, yet the state \u201cdoes not have a healthy workforce.\u201d He stated \u201cthere is a tremendous amount of work to be done\u201d in that area\u2014and he pointed out Toledo is no exception. \u201cWe don\u2019t rank very well when you think about the health and well-being of our people,\u201d Oostra said. \u201cWe focus a lot as a system on education.\u201d But the head of ProMedica stated Ohio\u2019s Medicaid expansion has been good for the Northwest Ohio economy, because the nonprofit health provider\u2019s insurance arm has added a lot of new jobs. Paramount is one of the state\u2019s five Medicaid insurance providers, helping to enroll an additional 600,000 previously uninsured Ohio residents under the Affordable Care Act. \u201cThis is a very positive thing in our community,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve lowered the uninsured rate to about ten percent. From a moral standpoint, from the Affordable Care Act, we would argue that\u2019s a very, very good thing to do.\u201d Mr. Oostra pointed out that what doctors do in the clinical setting only affects about 20 percent of a person\u2019s overall health. Another 20 to 25 percent is affected by genetics. The rest, he stated, is affected by what he called \u201csocial determinants\u201d\u2014a person\u2019s job, whether or not they take drugs, housing, and other factors. He also called hunger \u201ca health issue,\u201d which happens to be an area of focus for ProMedica in Northwest Ohio. The ProMedica president/CEO stated there was \u201can obesity epidemic\u201d several years ago that has shifted to a hunger problem across the region. But he pointed out there is \u201can interesting link between obesity, a lack of nutrition, and hunger.\u201d \u201cWe now screen for food insecurity at all of our hospitals and all of our doctor\u2019s offices,\u201d said Oostra. \u201cIf they respond positively, we have some resources to help with their short-term needs and we try to line up ongoing areas to help them. We\u2019ve created \u2018food pharmacies,\u2019 where doctors can write a prescription, so if you are a person who has a particular health issue, you can actually sit down with a dietician and walk out with short-term food needs.\u201d ProMedica and \u2018Food Deserts\u2019 Mr. Oostra also mentioned so-called \u201cfood deserts,\u201d places in Toledo where a lack of transportation forces people to shop in their own neighborhood, where fresh fruits and vegetables likely are not available to them. After the healthcare provider mapped the city in search of food deserts, ProMedica used a $1.5 million donation to form a unique market\u2014called Market on the Green\u2014at the corner of 18th and Madison in the Toledo\u2019s Uptown neighborhood. \u201cWe may continue to do more of those as we get more nonprofit support,\u201d he said. Oostra stated that ProMedica is active nationally in an effort to \u201craise hunger as a health issue\u201d and encourage other healthcare systems to get more involved through a group formed called the Root Cause Coalition. There will be a national study in partnership with the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) to examine hunger as a health issue. Seniors and single moms are particularly vulnerable when it comes to food insecurity, a term which means they run out of food at some point during the month. But the ProMedica chief executive also pointed out the region and state\u2019s physical health is heavily affected by mental health and an infant mortality rate that ranks next-to-last in the nation. Oostra told the crowd more than 40 percent of adults and children in the U.S. suffer some form of mental illness, yet only two in five seek treatment. \u201cSo we think about people changing their lives. We think about people in poverty. How do you get out of that? A lot of it has to do with our underinvestment in mental health,\u201d he said, pointing to a partnership with Harbor Behavioral Health to better coordinate mental health services with in the regular healthcare setting. ProMedica\u2019s Downtown Headquarters and other developments The ProMedica chief told the Rotary gathering that some work is already underway inside the former steam plant and elsewhere along Summit St. as the healthcare system seeks to build a new downtown Toledo headquarters campus. The goal is to open the renovated structures by mid-2017 and move 1,000 employees to the centrally-located facility. Mr. Oostra hinted that another 1,000 ProMedica employees could eventually join their colleagues along the Maumee River. Oostra stated that planning for a new $350 million, 13-story healthcare tower at Toledo Hospital has been two decades in the making, in order to replace some buildings there that are 90 years old. The ProMedica CEO stated the healthcare system has bought and torn down 70 homes in the West Toledo to make room for the new tower and reconfigure the Toledo Hospital campus. \u201cThat will go up in 2019 and create about 1,000 construction jobs,\u201d he said. Mr. Oostra stated ProMedica has opened two urgent care centers, with plans to open six total. \u201cUrgent care has been around for a long time. People just never went there,\u201d he said. \u201cBut now, with money coming out of people\u2019s pockets, they\u2019re shopping more. They want low-cost convenient care. The millennials don\u2019t want to wait. They just want to look on their phone and wonder \u2018can I go there right now?\u2019 We\u2019re seeing 30 to 40 patients per day. It\u2019s the wave of the future.\u201d But the ProMedica chief executive also focused on innovation during his speech, telling the 400 Rotarians gathered that one of the nonprofit health system\u2019s doctors has formed a company called VentureMed that sells vascular catheters in Europe. The device is used by patients with peripheral artery disease. The devices are produced locally, but he stated ProMedica \u201cis in active discussions\u201d with several companies to take over production. One of those is from the Silicon Valley. \u201cAs they\u2019ve come to Toledo, they\u2019ve figured out the airport is closer and they can live cheaper in Toledo than they can in Silicon Valley, so we think they\u2019re going to relocate to Toledo,\u201d he said. Mr. Oostra stated his belief that pending patents for health information systems, devices, and other innovations could mean 300 new jobs in Toledo \u201cin the next three or four years,\u201d which would be jobs \u201cwe traditionally have not had\u201d locally. Oostra also touched on ProMedica\u2019s recent agreement with the University of Toledo Medical Center as another job-generator, a way to attract and educate \u201cthe best and the brightest\u201d medical students and healthcare workers, with the hope of keeping them in Northwest Ohio. The nonprofit health system\u2019s eventual hope, he said, is to create an academic medical center. \u201cThere\u2019s no reason we can\u2019t be an Ann Arbor, a Madison, Wisconsin, or an Iowa City, because all the pieces and parts are there,\u201d he said, pointing to successful cities where healthcare systems and university medical centers have solid reputations as teaching hospitals. \u201cWhen you take the clinical volume of what we have at ProMedica and what exists today at the (UT) College of Medicine, we exceed what you see at Ohio State and the University of Michigan. We just need to do that more uniformly.\u201d The keynote luncheon speaker also noted the collaborative health care networking with other health care entities in the Midwest, including the Cleveland Clinic, Aultman, Ohio Health, Premier, and Tri-Health. The ProMedica CEO has immersed himself in the community personally, as well as professionally over the past two decades. Oostra is a board member of the Regional Growth Partnership, the Toledo Art Museum, and currently serves as the board chairman of the Toledo Symphony. Toledo Rotary The Rotary Club of Toledo is the eleventh largest such club in the world, and the 44th oldest, first chartered in 1912.
