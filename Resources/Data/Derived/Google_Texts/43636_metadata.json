He\u2019s done so with genuine concern for constituents, a forthright manner in his dealings and judicious decision-making.\n\nAs he seeks his third term in the U.S. Senate, Isakson stands as the clear choice for Republicans in the May 24 primary and for all Georgia voters in the November general election.\n\nIn the U.S. Senate, seniority matters. Isakson is the only Republican senator to chair multiple committees: the Senate Committee on Veterans\u2019 Affairs and Senate Select Committee on Ethics.\n\nHe has never voted for a tax increase, has led the fight against radical Islamic jihad and voted against President Barack Obama\u2019s \u201cpeace in our time\u201d appeasement deal with Iran.\n\nIn Georgia, he has fought to ensure that Georgia\u2019s ports are growing. And he has protected Georgia\u2019s access to water, pushing the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to update the manuals governing water use in Georgia, Florida and Alabama.\n\nOn the education front, Isakson added provisions to the Elementary and Secondary Education Act signed into law in late 2015 that repealed the Common Core provisions of the federal law and left those decisions up to the states. And he reinforced parental decision-making and parental opt-out provisions on testing.\n\nOn the transportation front, he made sure Georgia was getting back more of the dollars it puts into federal transportation funding, and reauthorized the highway trust fund for five years to ensure a predictable flow of highway money for federal interstates and federal projects in the state.\n\nIsakson has authored legislation to move to a two-year budget system that would force elected officials to become more accountable to the taxpayers, reduce spending and increase oversight.\n\nOn immigration, he opposes Obama\u2019s plan to expand Syrian refugee resettlement without adequate security safeguards. And he opposed the \u201cgang of eight\u201d immigration bill and Obama\u2019s executive amnesty.\n\nA defender of the Second Amendment, the NRA gives him an \u201cA\u201d rating, while the National Right to Life has given him a 100 percent for his pro-life stance.\n\nThe senator has opposed Obama\u2019s liberal appointments to the Supreme Court and voted to repeal Obamacare.\n\nLast year, Isakson announced he was in the early stages of Parkinson\u2019s disease. He said the diagnosis has not impacted his ability to represent Georgia. Isakson has a long record of sound judgment, which is why we are confident he wouldn\u2019t seek the job if he thought he couldn\u2019t get the job done.\n\nRome\u2019s retired Coca-Cola Co. bottler Frank Barron, who has known Isakson since he was a young real estate agent at Northside Realty, said \u201cit was apparent early on that Johnny had moral integrity\u201d and that \u201che has never let me down.\u201d Barron said he has watched Isakson\u2019s career and been pleased and impressed with his \u201cextreme ethical values, stellar reputation, and his representation of the views of the people of Georgia.\u201d\n\nGardner Wright, a retired Rome and Northwest Georgia textile executive, has also admired Isakson and been closely involved with his campaigns. Wright said \u201cJohnny is well respected, has voted conservative, and has been my buddy for a long time. I wish we could elect 100 US Senators just like him.\u201d\n\nIsakson began his business career in 1967 when he opened the first Cobb County office of a small, family-owned real estate business, Northside Realty. During his 20 years as president of Northside, the company grew into the largest independent residential real estate brokerage company in the Southeast.\n\nHe became active in Georgia\u2019s Republican Party in the early 1970s when Democrats ruled the roost and Republicans were rarer than hen\u2019s teeth.\n\nIsakson served for 17 years in the Georgia Legislature in both the House and Senate. In 1997, then-Gov. Zell Miller appointed him chairman of the Georgia Board of Education. He was elected in 1999 to the U.S. House for the first of three terms and was elected in 2004 and 2010 to the U.S. Senate.\n\nHe and his wife, Dianne, have been married since 1968 and they have nine grandchildren.\n\nWith his calm, steady hand and business-minded approach, Isakson\u2019s example is in stark contrast to the showboating politicians who dominate the headlines with their flamboyant, demagogic pandering.\n\nWashington needs more senators like Johnny Isakson. For the good of our county, for the good of our state, for the good of our nation, he should continue to serve.", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "Northwest Georgia News", "description": "Georgia\u2019s senior senator, Johnny Isakson, has plied a successful political career over the last 40 years-plus.
