Under the current federal subsidy structure, the annual income cut-off for premium subsidies is $45, 960 for a single person and $94,200 for a family of four. That means that those making under $100,000 (and with larger families) are far more likely to obtain help with out-of-pocket costs in the form of lower premiums.\n\nEven so, those premiums, which vary by state and type of plan, reflect only a portion of the total expenses a policyholder could pay for out-of-pocket charges. In buying any insurance plan, it's the combination of the premium with likely out-of-pocket expenses \u2014 copays and deductibles \u2014 that comprise your total cost.\n\nRelated: Obamacare Aftermath--Fewer Doctors, Higher Costs\n\nTop-tier \"platinum\" plans pay 90 percent of expenses, but you'll pay high premiums to obtain that kind of coverage. Calculating the real out-of-pocket expenses you might face with lower-tier plans can be more complicated. You have to weigh the plan\u2019s deductible and examine a range of other factors, including co-pays (flat fees per visit), co-insurance (percentage of the bill) and covered services.\n\nEvery plan's coverage is slightly different. Some items like generic drugs are covered generously while \"specialized\" drugs may be subject to a $150 co-pay plus 10 percent to 20 percent co-insurance. One Blue Cross \"silver\" plan I perused, for example, imposed a $500 co-pay for emergency room visits \u2013 plus 20 percent co-insurance. While I understand insurers want to discourage people from expensive emergency room visits, this is quite a stiff penalty and may be onerous if you or your family ends up in the ER frequently.\n\nTo make matters simpler, you can simply weigh the classic trade-off in insurance between premiums and out-of-pocket costs. If you want to cover more out-pocket costs, you will pay a higher premium and vice versa. When American Enterprise Institute fellow and Forbes blogger Dr. Scott Gottlieb looked at the most expensive HealthCare.gov plans, he found that they were a \"waste of money\":\n\n\"Unless you plan to use enough healthcare services to spend your entire deductible, for many people, buying the costlier gold or platinum plans will be wasted money. If you\u2019re not sure that you\u2019re going to max out your deductible, you may be better off buying a cheaper bronze plan and using the money saved on premiums to put some cash away to pay for your out of pocket costs.\"\n\nTrying to Find an Accurate Estimate\n\nWhen I started carefully researching plans on HealthCare.gov for my family of four, I tried to calculate our out-of-pocket costs for a year and encountered a blizzard of confusion. Under our current plan, we have an annual deductible of $5,800 and a $600 monthly premium, or $7,200 a year.\n\nRelated: Majority Still Having Problems with Obamacare Website\n\nSince the premium range of the \"bronze\" plans seemed closest to our current premium \u2013 although all were more expensive than our current policy \u2013 I started there. I sampled a \"Blue PPO Bronze 005\" plan.\n\nLike most preferred provider organization programs, this Blue Cross/Blue Shield of Illinois plan offered the best coverage for doctors and hospitals in their \"preferred network.\" That's been the case in private insurance for years. Insurers negotiate the biggest discounts with providers in their networks.\n\nIf we go outside the network, though, the co-insurance \u2013 a percentage paid for out-of-pocket expenses \u2013 jumps from 20 percent to 40 percent. Overall, though, the maximum out-of-pocket would be $12,700 per family or $6,250 per person. Like all Bronze plans, only 60 percent of expenses are covered; 100 percent after you meet the deductible.\n\nThe annual premium for this plan is nearly $8,000 \u2013 $800 more than we\u2019re paying now \u2013 and since we don\u2019t qualify for a subsidy, the HealthCare.gov plan is a non-starter for us. We\u2019re sticking with the private plan we already had.\n\nYou'll have to do some more homework to come up with the plan that's right for you. What kinds of services do you utilize the most? Are they covered by the plans you're eyeing? What are the co-pays and co-insurance for the services you need? Are your providers in the insurers' PPOs?\n\nIdeally, you can find a \"sweet spot\" in coverage that provides the essential coverage you need at an affordable price. Yet doing this on your own is burdensome and bound to lead to some unpleasant revelations on how much will truly come out of your pocket every year. None of these plans is perfect.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Anyone shopping for insurance on the new Obamacare exchanges knows \u2013 or needs to know \u2013 that the premiums there don\u2019t tell the full story on costs.", "title": "Why Premiums Are Just the Beginning of Obamacare Costs", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2014/02/05/Why-Premiums-Are-Just-Beginning-Obamacare-Costs", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/09182013_Healthcare_Exchange_DL.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2014/02/05/Why-Premiums-Are-Just-Beginning-Obamacare-Costs", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/09182013_Healthcare_Exchange_DL.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Anyone shopping for insurance on the new Obamacare exchanges knows \u2013 or needs to know \u2013 that the premiums there don\u2019t tell the full story on costs.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc544\"", "article_summary": "Related: Obamacare Aftermath--Fewer Doctors, Higher CostsTop-tier \"platinum\" plans pay 90 percent of expenses, but you'll pay high premiums to obtain that kind of coverage.\nTo make matters simpler, you can simply weigh the classic trade-off in insurance between premiums and out-of-pocket costs.\nAnyone shopping for insurance on the new Obamacare exchanges knows \u2013 or needs to know \u2013 that the premiums there don\u2019t tell the full story on costs.\nIn buying any insurance plan, it's the combination of the premium with likely out-of-pocket expenses \u2014 copays and deductibles \u2014 that comprise your total cost.\nThat means that those making under $100,000 (and with larger families) are far more likely to obtain help with out-of-pocket costs in the form of lower premiums."}
