And Sunday night, that particular brand of stupid was on abundant display after 24-year-old Miss New York, Nina Davuluri, won the Miss America pageant.\n\nAside from the first, obvious question \u2013 who knew anyone still even cared about the Miss America pageant? \u2013 the vocal response to the coronation of Ms. Davuluri raises another mystery. How is it possible that individuals who are at least functioning enough to turn on a phone or computer and type words on it can be so brain dead? The new Miss America Davuluri is a former dean\u2019s list student, an aspiring cardiologist and recovering bulimic. She\u2019s also now the pageant\u2019s first Indian-American Miss America, a woman who performed a \u201cBollywood fusion dance\u201d for the show\u2019s talent competition. And if you expected a deluge of racist trolling to follow because an Indian woman now has the word \u201cAmerica\u201d attached to her name, you weren\u2019t disappointed Sunday night. On Twitter, a Mr. CHEEZ-IT, for example, a man whose bio explains he\u2019d \u201crather be cummin then stroken\u201d (sic) swiftly declared, \u201cMiss America? You mean Miss 7-11.\u201d And a One Proud Honkie asked, \u201cHow can you be Miss AMERICA and look like you should be a gas station clerk or motel owner?\u201d\n\nIf you thought the haters would be outraged that a \u201cforeigner\u201d \u2013 Davuluri was born in Syracuse \u2014 took the crown, you\u2019d also have been correct. But if you expected the bigots to at least get their racism right, you were in for a letdown. As BuzzFeed points out, the dopes were swift to express their disappointment that an \u201cArab\u201d had won, wailing that her victory was a \u201cslap in the face to the people of 9-11\u2033 (Related: Who are \u201cthe people of 9-11\u2033? Are they related to the People of Wal-Mart?) and calling her a \u201cterrorist\u201d whose victory was for al-Qaida. There was also something about \u201cEgypt dancing.\u201d And it wasn\u2019t just the illiterate backwater yokels spewing this nonsense either \u2014 Fox News & Commentary host/professional troll huffily tweeted that \u201cThe liberal Miss America judges won\u2019t say this \u2013 but Miss Kansas lost because she actually represented American values\u201d and then crowned Davuluri \u201cMiss Politically Correct America.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The first Indian winner sparks a slew of hateful -- and absurdly inaccurate -- racism", "title": "Miss America brushes off the bigots", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The first Indian winner sparks a slew of hateful -- and absurdly inaccurate -- racism", "title": "Miss America brushes off the bigots", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2013/09/16/miss_america_faces_the_bigots/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/09/nina_davuluri.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The first Indian winner sparks a slew of hateful -- and absurdly inaccurate -- racism", "title": "Miss America brushes off the bigots", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/09/nina_davuluri.jpg", "creator": "@embeedub", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Mary Elizabeth Williams", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, 9/11, Editor's Picks, miss america, nina davuluri, Racism, Twitter", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd174\"", "article_summary": "And Sunday night, that particular brand of stupid was on abundant display after 24-year-old Miss New York, Nina Davuluri, won the Miss America pageant.\nThe new Miss America Davuluri is a former dean\u2019s list student, an aspiring cardiologist and recovering bulimic.\nAside from the first, obvious question \u2013 who knew anyone still even cared about the Miss America pageant?\nThere was also something about \u201cEgypt dancing.\u201d And it wasn\u2019t just the illiterate backwater yokels spewing this nonsense either \u2014 Fox News & Commentary host/professional troll huffily tweeted that \u201cThe liberal Miss America judges won\u2019t say this \u2013 but Miss Kansas lost because she actually represented American values\u201d and then crowned Davuluri \u201cMiss Politically Correct America.\u201d\nShe\u2019s also now the pageant\u2019s first Indian-American Miss America, a woman who performed a \u201cBollywood fusion dance\u201d for the show\u2019s talent competition."}
