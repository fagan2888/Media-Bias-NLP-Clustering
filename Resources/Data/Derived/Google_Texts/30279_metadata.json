A \u201cpositive\u201d diagnosis in the 1980s was often quickly followed by illness and death. The introduction of antiretroviral therapy in 1996 has saved millions of lives and revolutionized health outcomes. A \u201cpoz\u201d diagnosis today is considered a \u201cchronic but manageable\u201d condition \u2014 similar to diabetes \u2014 when people are linked to care and antiretroviral therapy soon after diagnosis.\n\nBut not everyone has benefited from these advances.\n\nHalf of black gay and bisexual men in the United States \u201cwill be diagnosed with HIV in their lifetime\u201d if current trends continue, according to analysis by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The study was presented in late February at the Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections in Boston, and was described as \u201cthe first-ever comprehensive national estimates of the lifetime risk of an HIV diagnosis\u201d in every state.\n\nTo offer some perspective: The nation with the highest rate of HIV prevalence is Swaziland \u2014 a tiny, landlocked kingdom within South Africa \u2014 at about 27 percent prevalence. The second-highest rate is in nearby Botswana, with 25 percent. If America\u2019s black gay and bisexual men comprised a nation unto themselves, that nation would soon have the world\u2019s highest rate of infection \u2014 twice as high as its closest rivals.\n\nThe financial burden would be staggering. The CDC estimates the average lifetime cost of treatment in this country to be about $400,000. Thousands of new cases a year means billions of dollars for HIV treatment alone. And those figures don\u2019t account for treatment for other illnesses, lost wages or productivity, or the emotional costs of depression, stigma, and anxiety.\n\nThe overall lifetime risk of an HIV infection for all Americans has dropped to 1 in 99, down from 1 in 78 a decade ago. African Americans, people who live in the South, and gay and bi men have the highest risks. The lifetime risk for \u201cmen who have sex with men,\u201d or MSM in public-health jargon, is 1 in 6. One in four Latino MSM and 1 in 11 white MSM are forecast to seroconvert \u2014 or become HIV-positive \u2014 in their lifetime.\n\nThe \u201calarming\u201d lifetime risk estimates are \u201cnot a foregone conclusion. They are a call to action,\u201d says Jonathan Mermin, M.D., director of the CDC\u2019s National Center for HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and Tuberculosis Prevention. \u201cHundreds of thousands of people will be diagnosed in their lifetime if we don\u2019t scale up\u201d prevention and care strategies.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s incredible that an organization which claims to be combating stigma would release this statistic that creates much more stigma,\u201d says Kenyon Farrow, the U.S. and global health policy director of the Washington-based Treatment Action Group. \u201cBut this is consistent with CDC\u2019s lack of an effective strategy toward ending the epidemic among black gay men.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe lack of cause-and-effect information was shocking,\u201d says Preston D. Mitchum, LL.M., the policy and research analyst at the D.C.-based Center for Health and Gender Equity. \u201cGovernment agencies don\u2019t really care about black men who have sex with men until they have a positive diagnosis.\u201d\n\nAfrican Americans and other black communities represent only 14 percent of the nation\u2019s population but account for a staggeringly disproportionate 44 percent of all new HIV infections. Black MSM \u2014 especially teens and men in their 20s \u2014 face the brunt of the epidemic. A growing body of research has made the case for years now.\n\nBlack MSM have been more affected by the epidemic than any other population in the world, the Black AIDS Institute reported four years ago in a study released at AIDS 2012. An estimated 1 in 2 black MSM are HIV-positive in some cities, the study adds. This was less than one year after an August 2011 CDC report noted an \u201calarming increase of new infections\u201d among black MSM ages 13 to 29.\n\n\u201cWhy isn\u2019t this a public health emergency? This probably has much to do with race and class,\u201d says Ramon Gardenhire, the AIDS Foundation of Chicago\u2019s vice president of policy and advocacy. \u201cWe see the same thing happening around the heroin epidemic in largely white suburbs. But we saw an overwhelming public-health response.\u201d\n\nThe number of fatal overdoses related to heroin and opioid use more than quadrupled between 2002 and 2013. As a result, cities, counties, states, and the federal government directed more resources into treatment, rehabilitation, and drug courts. Conversely, the response to the crack cocaine epidemic of the 1980s and 1990s, which occurred largely in heavily black metropolitan areas, was mass incarceration and harsh prosecutions.\n\nFUELING THE EPIDEMIC\n\nThere is not one specific reason new infections are increasing among black MSM. The data show that black MSM do not practice more of what has been described as \u201crisky behavior\u201d \u2014 multiple partners and intercourse without protection \u2014 than their white counterparts. Black couples were actually \u201cmore likely to use condoms,\u201d according to a study by San Francisco State University researchers.\n\nThe release of the CDC\u2019s lifetime risk estimates \u2014 without explanation or context \u2014 isn\u2019t just peculiar. It feeds \u201cinto the narrative across popular culture and the media that black men and women are hypersexualized, criminals, and sexual predators,\u201d says Ravi K. Perry, Ph.D., an associate professor of political science at Virginia Commonwealth University. \u201cWe tend to hear about the black queer experience only when it is [related] to HIV or [what] is often perceived as \u2018irresponsible sexual behavior.\u2019 \u201d\n\nLurid media coverage of black men as HIV-positive sexual predators has become sadly familiar. The case of 24-year-old Michael L. Johnson is one recent example. Johnson, a former Missouri college wrestler, was sentenced to 30 years in prison for \u201crecklessly infecting\u201d one male sexual partner with HIV and exposing four others to the virus in a prosecution that featured many racialized tropes. Missouri is one of at least 32 states and two territories that criminalize exposure or transmission of HIV, according to the Center for HIV Law and Policy.\n\nThese prosecutions increase stigma and make it more likely that people will not disclose their status. \u201cBlack gay men, black transgender women, and black straight men [are] more likely to be prosecuted,\u201d adds Mitchum.\n\nMany researchers believe a \u201cperfect storm\u201d of health, racial, and socioeconomic barriers \u2014 including limited access to health care and insurance, unemployment, poverty, housing insecurity, incarceration rates, homophobia, stigma, and racism \u2014 has fueled the epidemic across black communities. These factors have been exacerbated by inadequate federal, state, and local funding, as well as generations of government neglect.\n\nUnemployment rates are usually higher among black MSM youth. \u201cBecause they are less likely to be employed, they are less likely to have health insurance, and to be diagnosed in a timely manner. So there are very high rates of unrecognized infections among young black gay men,\u201d says Gregorio Millett, M.P.H., the American Foundation for AIDS Research\u2019s vice president and director of public policy. \u201cThen they are less likely to be in care, which means they are less likely to be able to be taking medications so they will not transmit HIV to their partners.\u201d\n\nThe high rates of new infections have not translated into more funding for prevention, adds Millett, who previously worked at the White House and was the co-author of the Obama Administration\u2019s National HIV/AIDS Strategy.\n\n\u201cThe Department of Health and Human Services found that although black MSM comprised half of the new infections in the African-American community, most of the prevention programming was going toward heterosexuals,\u201d he says. \u201cThat is a historic imbalance that is born of homophobia.\u201d\n\nSouthern Inhospitality\n\nThe states with the highest lifetime risk of seroconversion \u2014 with only some exceptions \u2014 are all Southern.\n\n\u201cAbout half of the people living with HIV are in the South. Most of them are black,\u201d says Treatment Action Group\u2019s Farrow. \u201cWe see very high numbers in places like Atlanta, Miami, Baton Rouge, New Orleans, and Jackson. Those cities have become the epicenter of the epidemic. It\u2019s no longer New York or San Francisco.\u201d\n\nThe South is also the stronghold of the Republican Party. The Southern states\u2019 rejection of expanding Medicaid eligibility under the Affordable Care Act \u2014 despite residents in those states being overwhelmingly poor and underinsured \u2014 is another critical factor behind the increase in black MSM infections.\n\n\u201cThe lack of health care infrastructure in the South has particularly impacted black gay men,\u201d says Farrow. \u201cUnder the Affordable Care Act, anyone who is HIV-positive can get insurance. But in [almost] all of these states the Republican governors and legislatures have refused to expand Medicaid.\u201d Arkansas and Kentucky are the only Southern states to have expanded Medicaid.\n\nLouisiana\u2019s new Democratic governor signed an executive order in January 2016 to expand Medicaid. But funding, hiring, and red tape have delayed its rollout. Meanwhile, New Orleans and Baton Rouge experience the second\u2013 and third-highest HIV rates in the country.\n\nConservative politics, religion, stigma, and racism have created a challenging climate for southern black LGBT residents \u2014 especially those who are positive.\n\nMarvell L. Terry II is the Human Rights Campaign\u2019s HIV/AIDS project manager. Terry grew up in Memphis. He learned his positive diagnosis about eight years ago.\n\n\u201cThere is very little culturally competent health care for us and very poor access to health care in Memphis,\u201d he says. \u201cThere is still much racism. Add to that the layer of being a black gay man in a Southern city where you have the headquarters of the Church of God in Christ, which is the largest Pentecostal denomination.\u201d There are no local organizations in Memphis that focus on black MSM health concerns, according to Terry.\n\nIt\u2019s just the opposite case in the Deep South\u2019s largest city. Atlanta is an oasis of progressive politics in a conservative state. It\u2019s also largely black and has been described as the \u201cblack San Francisco\u201d because of its high concentration of black gay and bi men. Atlanta has the nation\u2019s fifth-highest HIV rate and is also home to the CDC. New infections are increasing at about 12 percent a year among young black gay men in Atlanta. That\u2019s been described as \u201cone of the highest figures for HIV incidence ever recorded [in] the resource-rich world.\u201d\n\n\u201cAtlanta is resource-rich \u2014 at least on paper \u2014 when it comes to HIV services. But many of those resources do not [reach] black gay men on the street,\u201d says Atlanta resident Daniel D. Driffin, who has worked in prevention and advocacy. \u201cThere was a fiasco with Fulton County\u2019s previous health director turning away millions of dollars in funding from CDC. Fulton County now has an HIV task force. But this should have happened about eight years ago when the [federal government] began listening sessions to craft the National HIV/AIDS Strategy.\u201d\n\nEngagED Youth\n\nIt\u2019s going to take \u201ca multi-pronged approach to improve health outcomes, health access, health literacy, and [reduce] stigma\u201d among black MSM, says Orlando O. Harris, Ph.D., a TAPS Fellow at the University of California\u2013San Francisco\u2019s Center for AIDS Prevention Studies, who has researched African-American and Caribbean MSM communities. \u201cWe cannot have a one-size-fits-all intervention strategy [and we] must recognize there are many separate communities. Caribbean Americans often feel left out of prevention. The conversations have to be across generations,\u201d he adds. \u201cWe also need to have sex-positive conversations with young people.\u201d\n\nMany of these conversations have already begun, and in many cases the youth are leading them. Driffin was one of five young black gay men \u2014 along with Jamaal Clue, Venton Jones, Matthew Rose, and Christopher Chauncey Watson \u2014 who founded the Young Black Gay Leadership Initiative in 2011. It\u2019s an annual conference to build capacity, training, and leadership skill sets. So far, more than 300 people have attended, including Marvell Terry.\n\nTerry attended YBGLI\u2019s 2012 conference and was inspired to create his own foundation and annual conference in Memphis, the Red Door Foundation. Conversations with black gay and bisexual men must go beyond HIV prevention, says Terry and many others. \u201cCan we talk about mental health, education, housing, and police brutality? Some have [told me] they can handle HIV but they can\u2019t handle another police officer beating them up.\u201d\n\nYouth are also harnessing the power of social media to build greater health outcomes among black gay men. Driffin learned his positive diagnosis in 2008. He created a Facebook group for other \u201cpoz\u201d black MSM around Atlanta. \u201cIt\u2019s been amazing doing day-to-day interventions and helping people discuss medications and adherence,\u201d he says. \u201cSome have been living with HIV for 30 years, and this is the first time that they have been able to talk about their status.\u201d\n\nPrEP\n\nThe introduction of the antiretroviral Truvada for prevention \u2014 known as pre-exposure prophylaxis, or PrEP \u2014 has marked a historic shift toward a biomedical HIV-prevention model. Truvada is more than 90 percent effective in preventing HIV infection if taken at least four times per week. Several states and municipalities \u2014 including Washington State, San Francisco, and West Hollywood \u2014 have created PrEP access programs. But many of these regions are largely white. White gay men also enjoy better access to health care and insurance.\n\n\u201cThis is extremely problematic,\u201d says UCSF\u2019s Harris. \u201cWe have created a new disparity for black MSM. They are facing the brunt of the epidemic but cannot access [PrEP] as readily as white MSM.\u201d There is some good news: Georgia\u2019s Fulton County \u2014 which includes much of Atlanta \u2014 recently opened a free PrEP clinic.\n\nPrEP has become a buzzword across LGBT media and social media. But once again there is a racial divide. Black and white people often access the Internet and news through different platforms and media. That translates into lower awareness of PrEP among blacks. A number of community-based organizations have launched PrEP awareness and access campaigns to target black audiences.\n\nThe AIDS Foundation of Chicago recently launched a PrEP awareness campaign across Chicago\u2019s South Side. PrEP4Love uses \u201caffirming and sex-positive images of black gay men to remove some of the stigma around PrEP,\u201d says AFC\u2019s Gardenhire.\n\n\u201cWe need to begin a national conversation around PrEP just like we had a national conversation around safe sex,\u201d says Farrow. \u201cEveryone needs to know what it is. We need someone from CDC to go on all the black talk-radio shows \u2014 like Tom Joyner or Rickey Smiley \u2014 where millions are listening. The fact that they haven\u2019t done this is a failure of vision and leadership at the CDC.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Government neglect, unemployment,\u00a0health and socioeconomic disparities, racism, homophobia, and stigma\u00a0are all contributing to an escalating catastrophe.", "og": {"image": "http://www.advocate.com/sites/advocate.com/files/2016/04/27/perfect-storm-facing-black-men-x750_0.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-05-04T12:15:20-04:00", "type": "article", "title": "The Perfect Storm Facing Black Men on HIV"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Advocate", "fb": {"page_id": 19799718480, "app_id": 625763650825412, "pages": 6030918854}, "mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "article": {"published_time": "2016-05-02T05:01:58-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-05-02T05:01:58-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "\u201cBlack gay men, black transgender women, and black straight men [are] more likely to be prosecuted,\u201d adds Mitchum.\nDriffin was one of five young black gay men \u2014 along with Jamaal Clue, Venton Jones, Matthew Rose, and Christopher Chauncey Watson \u2014 who founded the Young Black Gay Leadership Initiative in 2011.\n\u201cThere is very little culturally competent health care for us and very poor access to health care in Memphis,\u201d he says.\nIt\u2019s also largely black and has been described as the \u201cblack San Francisco\u201d because of its high concentration of black gay and bi men.\nNew infections are increasing at about 12 percent a year among young black gay men in Atlanta."}
