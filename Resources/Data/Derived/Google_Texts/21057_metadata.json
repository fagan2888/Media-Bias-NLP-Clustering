Eighty percent of its US contracts are now compliant, up from 60 percent at the end of the second quarter, it said.\n\nShares in Securitas, whose biggest rival is British G4S (GFS.L), rose on the news, trading up 6.4 percent at 1114 GMT (6.14 a.m. EST).\n\nHowever, Chief Executive Alf Goransson cautioned that the remaining 20 percent of U.S. contracts that it aims to renegotiate by the end of the year would be the toughest ones to finalise.\n\nSecuritas employs around 310,000 people around the world, with a third of them in the United States, Canada and Mexico.\n\nTECHNOLOGY DRIVE\n\nSecuritas still gets the bulk of revenues from supplying guards but is pushing to expand its use of less labour-intensive technology such as smart cameras that can identify potential threats.\n\nAmerican clients have however been unexpectedly reluctant to adopt such technologies, Goransson said.\n\nHe said technology-based contracts account for a mere 2 percent of turnover in the United States. That makes the firm's target for them to comprise 18 percent of group turnover by the end of next year harder to achieve.\n\n\"Crucial for reaching the target is that we get a reasonable share of technology solutions in the United States, and the share is by mid-October smaller than we had counted on,\" he told Reuters.\n\nIn the third quarter technology based solutions accounted for 9.5 percent of group turnover, up from 9 percent in the second quarter and 8.5 percent in the first.\n\nOperating profit before amortisation at Securitas, which operates in 52 countries, grew to 962 million crowns ($130 million) from 892 million a year ago.\n\nThat beat a forecast 923 million in a Reuters poll of analysts, helped by better than expected organic sales growth of 4 percent with Argentina, Norway, Turkey and the United States performing well.\n\nAs flagged in a Reuters interview in August, Securitas said on Tuesday it would reorganise its troubled operations in crisis-hit Spain, one of its biggest markets.\n\nThe overhaul will consist in moving resources to technology based solutions -- which in Spain are nearing 20 percent of turnover -- and cutting costs. Restructuring costs of up to 2 million euros ($2.50 million) would be booked in the fourth quarter.\n\n(Reporting by Anna Ringstrom; Editing by Keith Weir)", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author":
