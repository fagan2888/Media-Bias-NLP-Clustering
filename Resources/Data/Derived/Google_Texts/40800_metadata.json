Net neutrality should not prevent access.\u201d\n\nPointing out that around 4 billion people are not connected, he added, \u201cIt\u2019s not an equal Internet if the majority of people can\u2019t participate.\u201d\n\nThe program is a partnership between Facebook and a number of mobile carriers to bring Internet access to many unconnected parts of the world.\n\nIn a process known as zero-rating, the Internet.org app allows mobile phone users to have free access to dozens of different websites, including news and jobs sites, Bing search, Wikipedia, ESPN, ACCuWeather, Facebook and others.\n\nIt has already launched in Indonesia, India and parts of Africa and South America. It is meant to give people a taste of the Internet so they can eventually become paying customers.\n\nThe program has been criticized in India by some who argue it goes against net neutrality, the principle that no Internet traffic or app should be prioritized above another.\n\nThe business model of zero-rating became a controversial topic during the U.S. debate about net neutrality. While the Federal Communications Commission has been silent on zero-rating, officials said the agency would hear complaints on those business models on a case-by-case basis under its catch-all net neutrality provision.\n\nFacebook points out that websites participating in the program do not pay to be included.\n\n\u201cAre we a community that values people and improving people\u2019s lives above all else, or are we a community that puts the intellectual purity of technology above people\u2019s needs?\u201d Zuckerberg asked.\n\nFacebook said it has always planned to expand the program. Firms wishing to participate must create features to encourage the exploration of the broader Internet, must remove video and high-resolution photos and meet other specifications.\n\n\u2014 This post was updated at 4 p.m.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "\u201cAccess equals opportunity,\" he said. \"Net neutrality should not prevent access.\u201d", "description": "\u201cAccess equals opportunity,\" he said. \"Net neutrality should not prevent access.\u201d", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Mario Trujillo", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "\u201cAccess equals opportunity,\" he said. \"Net neutrality should not prevent access.\u201d", "title": "Zuckerberg blasts \u2018extreme definition\u2019 of net neutrality", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/technology/240925-zuckerberg-argues-against-extreme-definition-of-net-neutrality", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/blogs/zuckerbergmark_022414getty.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-05-04T16:01:00-04:00", "type": "article"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2015-05-04T16:01-04:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/technology/240925-zuckerberg-argues-against-extreme-definition-of-net-neutrality", "dcterms.date": "2015-05-04T10:11-04:00", "dcterms.creator": "Mario Trujillo", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Facebook, Net neutrality, Internet.org,Mark Zuckerberg,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-05-04T10:11:36-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-05-04T16:01:00-04:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/technology/240925-zuckerberg-argues-against-extreme-definition-of-net-neutrality", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "\u201cAccess equals opportunity,\" he said. \"Net neutrality should not prevent access.\u201d", "card": "summary", "title": "Zuckerberg blasts \u2018extreme definition\u2019 of net neutrality"}, "dcterms.title": "Zuckerberg blasts \u2018extreme definition\u2019 of net neutrality"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc7b9\"", "article_summary": "ADVERTISEMENT\u201cSome may argue for an extreme definition of net neutrality that says that it\u2019s somehow wrong to offer any more services to support the unconnected, but a reasonable definition of net neutrality is more inclusive,\u201d Zuckerberg said in a video announcing the expansion.\nFacebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg argued against an \u201cextreme definition\u201d of net neutrality on Monday while announcing the expansion of a program to bring basic Internet service to people around the world.\nThe business model of zero-rating became a controversial topic during the U.S. debate about net neutrality.\nWhile the Federal Communications Commission has been silent on zero-rating, officials said the agency would hear complaints on those business models on a case-by-case basis under its catch-all net neutrality provision.\nThe program has been criticized in India by some who argue it goes against net neutrality, the principle that no Internet traffic or app should be prioritized above another."}
