Reuters has seen the future, and its cops can commune with a database that tells them whether a wanted man is within their line of sight:

Dubai police plan to issue detectives with Google Glass hands-free eyewear to help them fight crime using facial recognition technology, a police spokesman in the wealthy Gulf Arab emirate said.



The wearable device consists of a tiny computer screen mounted in the corner of an eyeglass frame and is capable of taking photos, recording video and playing sound.



The spokesman confirmed a report in Dubai's 7 Days newspaper that software developed by Dubai police would enable a connection between the wearer and a database of wanted people.



Once the device "recognized" a suspect based on a face print, it would alert the officer wearing the gadget.

Just what every police state needs! If you'd like to spin a dystopian scenario, imagine a story about hackers wreaking havoc with the system, or offer another science-fiction vision, the comment thread is open. While you're there, you can debate which is creepier, the prospect of the system returning false positives or the prospect of the system running smoothly.
