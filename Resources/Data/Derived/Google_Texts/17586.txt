On his Monday night program, Comedy Central’s “The Daily Show” anchor Jon Stewart gave a scathing critique of the rollout of Obamacare, saying “Democrats can’t spin this turd.”

Stewart noted that following the government shutdown, which some circles have blamed on the GOP, the United States was poised to turn “bluer than a Smurf’s balls after dry humping a bottle of Windex,” but following the roll out of Obamacare, those possibilities have been hurt. Noting the number of people that have visited the site and their success ratio, the host unloaded:

“Oh my God, less than 10 percent?” Stewart said. “How bad is that? Twenty percent is the number of dentists who recommend sugared gum. How low is it? According to a recent poll, more of this country believes Obamacare has been repealed than have been able to sign up for Obamacare. The whole point of web sites is to design them so that it is nearly impossible to not sign up for something. Every time I go on Amazon there’s a 40 percent chance I’ll mistakenly overnight myself six seasons of ‘Night Court.’ It’s just the way it’s designed. ‘Are you sure you want to leave this page?’ Yes I am — oops, turns out I ordered something. So how are the Democrats going to spin this turd?”

Watch:

Stewart played a clip from New York Democratic Sen. Chuck Schumer from NBC’s “Meet the Press” over the weekend, who spun it as “huge” since 19 million people had visited the site.

“That’s huge,” Stewart said. “You’ve angered a lot of people.”
