Is consuming weed a form of religion? Are the state's Right to Farm laws protecting giant corporations at the expense of farm families they were meant to protect?\n\nSuch questions are at the heart of many high-profile cases that are now before the courts. Here are some of them, in no particular order:\n\nSyrian refugees\n\nGov. Mike Pence is facing a federal lawsuit that challenges his power to block Syrian refugees from resettling in Indiana. Pence and several other governors suspended resettlement of Syrian refugees in their states after terrorist attacks in Paris.\n\nA lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union of Indiana and Exodus Refugee Immigration, an Indianapolis nonprofit that receives federal dollars to resettle refugees in Indiana, says Pence doesn't have the authority to interfere with refugee and immigration policies.\n\nThe Archdiocese of Indianapolis settled a Syrian refugee family in Indianapolis despite the governor's decision. Pence later said he would not block the family from receiving aid such as food stamps and health care.\n\nRight to Farm\n\nA lawsuit pending in Hendricks Superior Court contends that the state's Right to Farm laws, meant to help farm families, unfairly protect giant corporations by allowing industrial-scale livestock operations to be built close to residential areas despite possible health hazards.\n\nThe nonprofit Hoosier Environmental Council filed the lawsuit on behalf of a Danville farmer and four other residents who live close to a feedlot that warehouses up to 8,000 hogs.\n\nBuy Photo This livestock operation is west and slightly south of Richard Himsel's property, on County Road 425 West in Hendricks County. Himsel lives on the farm his family has owned near Danville since 1940. Himsel has filed a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of Indiana's Right to Farm laws.

Harrison County Clerk Sally Whitis \"acted appropriately\" when she fired Summers, according to Whitis' attorney.\n\nBirth certificate dispute\n\nShould the state of Indiana recognize both same-sex parents of a child on a birth certificate? Such is one of the legal questions that courts must answer after a landmark decision by the U.S. Supreme Court to legalize same-sex marriage in the country.\n\nJackie Phillips-Stackman and her wife, Lisa, filed a lawsuit against state and local health departments to have both of their names on their child's birth certificate. The documents, they say, continue to treat marriage as being between a man and a woman.\n\nBuy Photo Jackie and Lisa Phillips-Stackman hold their daughter, Lola, at their Indianapolis home, Friday, Dec. 4, 2015. The couple are filing a lawsuit against the state to try to get Indiana to recognize both same-sex parents on their children's birth certificates.

Legislators added the \"fix\" to prevent RFRA from being used to supersede local and state civil rights laws.\n\nChurch of Cannabis\n\nShould the court recognize the First Church of Cannabis as a real religion? Is marijuana part of a deeply held religious belief?\n\nSuch are the questions that the court must answer after a lawsuit claiming state laws making marijuana illegal burden a religious practice and place the church's members in danger of criminal prosecution.\n\nThe case also raises questions about how Indiana's RFRA can and can't be used.\n\nBuy Photo Grand Poobah Bill Levin gets down Mick Jagger style during the First Church of Cannabis' inaugural service.

Sowell's death is now the subject of a federal lawsuit that accuses Indianapolis police officers of shooting and killing an unarmed man.\n\nAn attorney representing Sowell's family told reporters that several witnesses confirmed the father of three was unarmed and surrendering, but police kept shooting. An autopsy report showed Sowell was shot six times, at least four times from behind.\n\nBuy Photo The family of Donte Sowell showed photos during a news conference on Sept. 10, 2015, to announce a lawsuit filed against IMPD in the death of Sowell, who was shot and killed in an incident with police on Jan. 15, 2015. This photo shows Sowell with three of his four children. His fourth child was born after he died.

The lawsuit claims Syngenta sold genetically modified corn seeds to U.S. farmers despite knowing that China, a key importer of U.S. corn, would reject the GMO products.\n\nBlueIndy\n\nMarion County Auditor Julie Voorhies claims in a lawsuit that city officials illegally paid $6 million to BlueIndy for its electric car-sharing service.\n\nThe lawsuit asks for a temporary ban on future BlueIndy-related construction. BlueIndy officially launched in September.\n\nStar reporters Stephanie Wang and Jill Disis and the Associated Press contributed to this story.\n\nCall Star reporter Kristine Guerra at (317) 444-6209.
