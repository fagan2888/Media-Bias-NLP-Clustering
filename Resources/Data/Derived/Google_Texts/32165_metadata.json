John Kasich did a fairly dramatic about-face over the weekend on the politically charged issue of climate change.\n\nKasich, a former House Budget Committee chair and Wall Street business executive, has positioned himself as a \u201ckinder, gentler\u201d conservative than Jeb Bush, Ted Cruz and the dozen other Republicans running for the 2016 presidential nomination. So it wasn\u2019t surprising that he would take a more moderate stand on global warming during the first nationally televised GOP presidential debate Thursday evening.\n\nRelated: 10 Things You Need to Know About John Kasich\n\nKasich, a devout Christian, declared during the two-hour debate sponsored by Fox News that climate change is a real problem requiring government and society to protect the \u201ccreation that the Lord has given us.\u201d\n\nWhile the vast majority of Republicans on Capitol Hill and the campaign trail are highly skeptical of President Obama\u2019s campaign to curb industrial carbon emissions to prevent the disastrous long term effects of global warming on the environment and economy, Kasich appeared to be one of the few who took the threat seriously.\n\nHe emphasized the importance of unity and cooperation, saying at one point that \u201cwe\u2019ve got to unite our country again, because we\u2019re stronger when we are united and we are weaker when we are divided.\u201d\n\nJust a few days later, though, after winning plaudits for his Thursday night performance \u2013 with some even favorably comparing his views on environmental threats to those of Pope Francis \u2013 Kasich sounded much like a climate-change doubter.\n\nRelated: Does Kasich Have a Chance? How He Can Catch Up to the GOP\n\nDuring an appearance on NBC News\u2019 \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d Kasich told moderator Chuck Todd that \u201cI think man absolutely affects the environment, but as to whether, you know, what the impact is, the overall impact, I think that\u2019s a legitimate debate.\u201d\n\nKasich went on to say that in Ohio, \u201cwe preciously take care of Lake Erie, and we\u2019ve reduced emissions by 30 percent over the last ten years.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe believe in alternative energy,\u201d he added. \u201cSo of course we have to be sensitive to it, but we don\u2019t want to destroy people\u2019s jobs, based on some theory that\u2019s not proven.\u201d\n\nAccording to National Journal, the Kasich 2016 campaign attempted to clarify his remarks following his appearance on \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d \"The governor has long believed climate change is real and we need to do something about it,\u201d according to the statement. \u201cThe debate over exact percentages of why it is happening is less important than what can be done about it. We know it is real, we know man has an impact, and we know we need to do something.\"\n\nA number of prominent presidential candidates -- including former Florida governor Jeb Bush and Sens. Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio, and Rand Paul -- are climate change doubters or deniers. Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina is one of the few who unquestionably accepts scientific evidence that man-made greenhouse gas emissions are a principal cause of global warming, and has sharply criticized his party for lacking a comprehensive environmental platform.\n\nTop Reads From The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Maybe it\u2019s because he is still feeling his way as a late entrant into the GOP presidential campaign, but Ohio Gov.
