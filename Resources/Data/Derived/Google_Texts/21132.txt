The video, features a clip from the 2004 German movie "Downfall" of Hitler realizing that all was lost while his Berlin bunker. However, the subtitles have been changed to show the genocidal German dictator complaining that he was being forced to see a Jewish doctor, Dr. Feingold, for his prostate screening instead of Dr Steiner under Obamacare. Hitler then rages that he was told that if he liked his plan, he could keep it. The video ends with Hitler noting that "Obama now has a growing integrity gap. His poll numbers are plummeting." It ends with the Nazi leader mournfully noting "there's no way we can pin this one on Bush."
