One likely reason this is the case: Drug costs are the first thing people think of when they think of the growing out of pocket costs they are paying for health care, at a time when their wages have been relatively flat.\n\nIn our Kaiser Family Foundation polling in April, surprisingly, \u201cmaking sure that high-cost drugs for chronic conditions are affordable to those who need them\u201d emerged as the public\u2019s No. 1 priority for President Barack Obama and Congress, with 75% of the public saying it should be a top priority, far ahead of various other Affordable Care Act issues. \u201cGovernment action to lower drug prices\u201d was No. 2, picked by 60 % of the public and by 51% of republicans. (Respondents could choose multiple top priorities.)\n\nThen, in our August polling, we asked which health costs people with health coverage find to be the greatest burden. As the chart below shows, deductibles led a closely bunched list, followed by premium payments, drug costs and doctor visits. Deductibles have been rising steadily each year, especially for people who work for smaller employers, as insurance has gradually been moving from more to less comprehensive, with more \u201cskin in the game\u201d for consumers.\n\nYou might think people prioritized action on prescription drugs in our poll because they have been hearing about high drug costs in the news. But that doesn\u2019t appear to be the case, with only 5% of the public reporting that they followed stories about expensive treatments for hepatitis C very closely and 6% saying the same about new cholesterol drugs. Instead, personal experience seems to be driving people\u2019s impressions. Over half of the public reports taking a prescription drug, and almost 40% of those people report taking four or more drugs.\n\nAnd while most people say they can afford their drugs, sick people and people who use more drugs are much more likely to report problems paying for drugs, or that they or a family member have had to skip doses or cut pills in half to make prescriptions last longer. Seventy-six percent of the public blames drug companies for high drug prices \u2013 with just 10% blaming insurers. The public ranks the pharmaceutical industry right between the oil industry and insurance companies in overall favorability.\n\nThe result is that people favor virtually any action we poll on that they believe might reduce drug prices.\n\nDrug spending represents just 10% of overall health spending. But the number of transactions people have with the health system is much larger for drugs than for physician visits or hospital stays or other services\u2013and the cost is very immediate and tangible. Concern about drug prices is best understood as the tip of the iceberg of a larger concern consumers have about out-of-pocket costs. It\u2019s an example of a basic rule of health policy: Experts think more about national and government spending for health while people focus more on health care as a pocketbook issue.\n\nDrew Altman is president and chief executive officer of the Kaiser Family Foundation.
