By 8:15 p.m., the heavy weather had moved into flood-weary north Colorado. A flash flood warning was issued for the Fort Morgan area at 7:45 p.m., with up to 2 inches of new rain expected in the next hour.\n\nLater, a flash flood warning was extended until 9:13 a.m. Sunday for Weld County.\n\nSaturday afternoon, cars were stranded in water in the area of Broncos Parkway and Parker Road, according to the National Weather Service, and Cherry Creek was overflowing its banks, affecting trails in the area. Street flooding was reported in Aurora.\n\nBy 6 p.m., things had calmed down in Aurora, Cassidee Carlson, spokeswoman for Aurora police, said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty much lightened up.\u201d\n\nBut some intersections and portions of streets are closed including sections of Potomac Street and Alameda Avenue. There\u2019s standing water on I-225 but it\u2019s open to traffic.\n\nNo injuries were reported, she said, but \u201cwe have had to do some rescues with people who tried to drive through the water.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve actually got blue sky here in Boulder, but it should be moving through sometime this afternoon,\u201d Byron Lewis, meteorologist for the National Weather Service in Boulder, said at noon.\n\nThe chance of rain increases to 60 percent Sunday and falls to 20 percent Monday along the Front Range, Lewis said. It will dry out from Tuesday through the remainder of next week. The weather service has the northern Front Range under flash flood watch.\n\nAfter the Waldo Canyon burn scar was hit with as much as 10 inches of rain Wednesday and Thursday, the weather service expects the Colorado Springs area to receive another inch of rain Sunday.\n\nThe southern range is dry Saturday, said Larry Walrod, lead forecaster at the National Weather Service in Pueblo, but rain will begin around 6 a.m. Sunday and continue through the evening. If the rain accumulates too quickly, more flooding problems will arise at the city\u2019s burn scars, he said.\n\n\u201cThe ground is still very saturated, so any additional rainfall will have a tendency to run off much quicker,\u201d Walrod said.\n\nNortheast Colorado received heavy rain overnight, with New Raymer getting 1.84 inches of rain, Lewis said. There\u2019s a 40 percent of rain in the north Sunday. Rain is expected to clear out of the northeast Sunday night.\n\nMorgan, Washington and Logan counties are under a flash flood warning Saturday.\n\nThe primary concern in those areas are water levels in the Cache la Poudre and South Platte rivers. Areas within a half-mile of the South Platte River were evacuated Saturday morning in Orchard, Goodrich and Wiggins.\n\nThe South Platte River landlocked communities in Weld County on Friday but began to level off Saturday, Lewis said. A gauge on the river in Kersey, a town just east of Greeley, showed water levels were slightly decreasing.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s going to hold steady and you won\u2019t see significant increases unless we get significant precipitation over the area,\u201d Lewis said.\n\nKirk Mitchell: 303-954-1206, kmitchell@denverpost.com or twitter.com/kmitchelldp", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Colorado flood: New warnings as storm hits Fort Morgan area", "title": "Colorado flood: New warnings as storm hits Fort Morgan area", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2013/09/14/colorado-flood-new-warnings-as-storm-hits-fort-morgan-area/", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20130914__folsom-FLOODINGNEARFOLSOM1p1-1.jpg", "height": 386}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20130914__folsom-FLOODINGNEARFOLSOM1p1-1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2013-09-14T08:39:16+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-28T16:06:15+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce8b3\"", "article_summary": "Later, a flash flood warning was extended until 9:13 a.m. Sunday for Weld County.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s going to hold steady and you won\u2019t see significant increases unless we get significant precipitation over the area,\u201d Lewis said.\nA flash flood warning was issued for the Fort Morgan area at 7:45 p.m., with up to 2 inches of new rain expected in the next hour.\nMorgan, Washington and Logan counties are under a flash flood warning Saturday.\nNortheast Colorado received heavy rain overnight, with New Raymer getting 1.84 inches of rain, Lewis said."}
