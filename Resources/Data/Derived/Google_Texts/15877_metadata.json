Andrew Cuomo in a Twitter update Wednesday. AFT is fighting the Democrat governor\u2019s attempt to expand charter schools, which have far lower unionization rates than traditional public schools.\n\nEducation is a pub good-not a profit scheme.Yet hedgers convincing investors there\u2019s $ to be made in charter schls. http://t.co/twmwa13fqU \u2014 Randi Weingarten (@rweingarten) March 11, 2015\n\nWeingarten opposes school choice but supports the hard-left U.S. Student Association\u2019s call for \u201cfree\u201d college education and President Obama\u2019s proposal for taxpayer-funded universal preschool.\n\nHeavier federal subsidization of preschool and college could mean millions per year in additional AFT dues, but what suggests Weingarten cares about money?\n\nWeingarten\u2019s gross salary from July 1, 2013 to June 30, 2014 \u2014 as reported by AFT to the U.S. Department of Labor \u2014 was $375,174. Including all other disbursements to Weingarten, AFT reported paying her a total of $557,875.\n\nAnd yet you were paid $557K last year\u2026 weird.

Like all public-sector unions, AFT spends dues and mandatory \u201cfair share\u201d fees to promote big government.\n\nFair share fees, which unions are permitted to use only for representation costs, can be taken from teachers in 21 states as a condition of employment. A portion of Weingarten\u2019s compensation comes from nonmembers who would be fired for refusing to pay AFT.\n\nAFT headquarters does not report a total number of fair share payers to the Department of Labor, but AFT affiliate New York state United Teachers took mandatory fees from 23,365 nonmembers last year.\n\nThe union strives mightily to distract from these facts, as demonstrated by AFT communications manager Evan Sutton\u2019s responses to Twitter posts about Weingarten\u2019s pay. Sutton, whose salary was $59,898 in 2014, asserted Weingarten is fairly compensated and complained about corporate CEOs.\n\n@jasonahart so is your position that people like @rweingarten who are at the top of their field shouldn\u2019t be compensated as such? \u2014 Evan Sutton (@suttnutz) March 11, 2015\n\n@mt_newman @rweingarten believes ppl shld be fairly paid. Just doesn\u2019t think current system\u2014CEOs make 350x avg worker\u2014is fair. @jasonahart \u2014 Evan Sutton (@suttnutz) March 12, 2015\n\n@mt_newman not at all. I\u2019m all for CEOs making 20-25x avg worker, as they did in 60s/70s. Not 350x avg worker tho @rweingarten @jasonahart \u2014 Evan Sutton (@suttnutz) March 12, 2015\n\nWeingarten responded to critics by claiming she\u2019s paid $360,000 to be president \u201cof a 1.6m member union devoted to helping others.\u201d\n\n@LifeOnAHorse -i taught students in the 90s- the best job I ever had-i get paid 360k-abt3x what I would earn if I was still teaching in NYC. \u2014 Randi Weingarten (@rweingarten) March 12, 2015\n\n@Roger247 \u2013 I earn 360/year; I would love to go back to teaching\u2026.my job is to be Prez of a 1.6m member union devoted to helping others \u2014 Randi Weingarten (@rweingarten) March 12, 2015\n\nLater, having repeatedly misrepresented her pay, Weingarten said her salary is about $370,000. She then accused critics of misrepresenting her pay.\n\n@jasonahart -so jason\u2013u know my salary was abt $370k -abt 3x what i would have made as a NYC teacher-why the need to always misrepresent.. \u2014 Randi Weingarten (@rweingarten) March 12, 2015\n\nWednesday night was just the latest example of Weingarten tripping over the line walked by all \u201cprogressive\u201d labor leaders: solidarity chants and attacks on the rich don\u2019t exactly fit with huge salaries paid using forced union dues.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Free preschool-to-college education is a right and charter schools are \"a profit scheme,\" according to the head of America's second-largest teachers union.", "og": {"site_name": "Watchdog.org", "description": "Free preschool-to-college education is a right and charter schools are \"a profit scheme,\" according to the head of America's second-largest teachers union.", "title": "Wealthy teachers union boss bashes charter 'profit scheme' - Watchdog.org", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2015/03/RandiWeingarten.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-03-25T09:42:45+00:00", "url": "http://watchdog.org/205397/union-profit-scheme/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Watchdog.org", "description": "Free preschool-to-college education is a right and charter schools are \"a profit scheme,\" according to the head of America's second-largest teachers union.", "title": "Wealthy teachers union boss bashes charter 'profit scheme' - Watchdog.org", "image": {"src": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2015/03/RandiWeingarten.jpg"}, "creator": "@jasonahart", "site": "@watchdogorg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noarchive", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Watchdogorg", "section": "Labor", "published_time": "2015-03-13T04:00:03+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-03-25T09:42:45+00:00"}, "news_keywords": "teachers union, aft, american federation of teachers, randi weingarten, big labor, union bosses, union dues, forced dues, fair share fee"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb948\"", "article_summary": "By Jason Hart | Watchdog.orgFree preschool-to-college education is a right and charter schools are \u201ca profit scheme,\u201d according to the head of America\u2019s second-largest teachers union.\nIncluding all other disbursements to Weingarten, AFT reported paying her a total of $557,875.\nhttp://t.co/twmwa13fqU \u2014 Randi Weingarten (@rweingarten) March 11, 2015Weingarten opposes school choice but supports the hard-left U.S. Student Association\u2019s call for \u201cfree\u201d college education and President Obama\u2019s proposal for taxpayer-funded universal preschool.\nAmerican Federation of Teachers president Randi Weingarten, who was paid $557,875 during the union\u2019s 2014 fiscal year, routinely suggests education reformers are motivated only by money.\nAFT is fighting the Democrat governor\u2019s attempt to expand charter schools, which have far lower unionization rates than traditional public schools."}
