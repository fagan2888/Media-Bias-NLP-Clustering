SANTA BARBARA, Calif. -

The Teddy Bear Cancer foundation will host its inaugural Moments in Time fundraising event Saturday night, and one little girl is getting recognized.



Eleven year old Faith is a 5th grader from Santa Maria. She was diagnosed with Stage 2 Hodgkins Lymphoma and will soon be completing her last round of chemo therapy in the coming weeks.

The Teddy Bear Cancer Foundation which serves hundreds of children and their families each year from Ventura county to San Luis Obispo Counties, sent Faith shopping at K-Frank in downtown Santa Barbara. The shopping trip was planned so she can pick out a dress for Saturday's event.

But that's not all. This is among the first of many surprises for the little girl as part of the group's Moments in Time program.



Faith will also get her make-up done by SAKS and there is a huge surprise that is set to be announced at the event.

Moments in Time will take place Saturday night at the Santa Barbara Club.
