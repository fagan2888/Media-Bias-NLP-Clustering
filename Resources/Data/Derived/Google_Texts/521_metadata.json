When one of our children wakes up complaining of a sore throat, we could begin a ritual stare-down to determine which of us is going to have to wait for the doctor\u2019s office to open, make the phone call, wait on hold, schedule an appointment (which will inevitably be in the middle of the day), take off work, pick up the child from school, sit in the waiting room (surrounded by other sick children), get the rapid strep test, find out if the child is infected and then go to the pharmacy or back to school, before returning to work.\n\nOr, one of us could just take the child to a retail clinic on the way to work and be done in 30 minutes. Strep throat is incredibly easy to treat (Penicillin still works great!). There\u2019s a simple and very fast test for it. Moreover, physicians are really bad at diagnosing some of these common illnesses clinically; a study found that a doctor\u2019s guess as to whether a respiratory infection is bacterial or viral is right about 50 percent of the time \u2014 no better than flipping a coin. The point is, you need to get the rapid strep test every time regardless, whether at your doctor\u2019s office or at a clinic.\n\nAimee and I choose the retail clinic every time.\n\nWhy? Convenience is the biggest reason. Many doctors\u2019 offices are open only on weekdays and during business hours. This also happens to be when most adults work and when children attend school. A 2010 survey of 11 countries found that Americans seek out after-hours care or care in a hospital\u2019s emergency room more often than citizens of almost any other industrialized nation. More than two-thirds of Americans with a below-average income did so. But this isn\u2019t just a problem for the poor. About 55 percent of those with an above-average income did so as well.\n\nWe complain all the time that people use the emergency room for primary care. But that\u2019s not always about lack of insurance. It\u2019s about access. The emergency room is open when people can actually go. Emergency room use has gone up, not down, since the passage of the Affordable Care Act. More people have insurance, and now can afford care when they need it.\n\nThat care is also coming from retail clinics, usually found either in stand-alone storefronts or inside pharmacies. Between 2007 and 2009, retail clinic use increased 10-fold. It turns out that my wife and I represent America pretty well. About 35 percent of retail visits for children are for pharyngitis \u2014 sore throats. Add in ear infections and upper respiratory infections, and you\u2019ve accounted for more than three-quarters of visits for children. Parents bring their children to retail clinics to take care of quick, acute problems. Swap ear infections for immunizations, and you\u2019ve got the main reasons adults use retail clinics, too.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nResearchers for a study published in the American Journal of Medical Quality talked to patients who sought out care at retail clinics. Patients who had a primary care physician, but still went to a retail clinic, did so because their primary care doctors were not available in a timely manner. A quarter of them said that if the retail clinic weren\u2019t available, they\u2019d go to the emergency room.\n\nIt\u2019s understandable why physicians\u2019 groups might be opposed to retail clinics. Above and beyond the obvious economic loss when a patient goes elsewhere, many primary care physicians correctly point out that retail clinics often lack the knowledge and experience that come from continuity of care. For many years, experts have argued that medical homes are the optimal way to care for children, especially those with chronic conditions. Those are primary care doctors\u2019 offices that offer a comprehensive, patient-centered, team-based, coordinated approach. Retail clinics are pretty much the opposite.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20160412080024, "twitter": {"description": "Research hasn\u2019t backed up many of the concerns of doctors, but the clinics don\u2019t seem to be a solution for trimming health spending.", "title": "The Undeniable Convenience and Reliability of Retail Health Clinics", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/13/upshot/the-undeniable-convenience-and-reliability-of-retail-health-clinics.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000004300322"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "creator": "aaronecarroll", "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/04/02/upshot/04UP-Clinic/04UP-Clinic-thumbLarge.jpg", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/13/upshot/the-undeniable-convenience-and-reliability-of-retail-health-clinics.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000004300322", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/13/upshot/the-undeniable-convenience-and-reliability-of-retail-health-clinics.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "thumbnail_width": 75, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "upshot", "hdl_p": "The Hidden Cost of Retail Health Clinics", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/upshot/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "April 12, 2016", "edt": "NewYork", "org": "Health Affairs (Journal)", "keywords": "Health Insurance and Managed Care,Doctors,Health Affairs (Journal),Emergency Medical Treatment,Drugstores,Hospitals", "news_keywords": "Doctor,Drugstore,Hospital", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "Aaron E.
