Ted Cruz could walk away from Louisiana\u2019s March 5 primary with more delegates than Donald Trump\u2014despite losing to him\u2014anyone could\u2019ve predicted that Trump would threaten to sue over it.\n\nSure enough, the real estate mogul took to Twitter on Sunday to promise that a lawsuit is indeed coming.\n\nJust to show you how unfair Republican primary politics can be, I won the State of Louisiana and get less delegates than Cruz-Lawsuit coming \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 27, 2016\n\nCruz lost to Trump in The Bayou State by 3.6 percentage points. At the time, both walked away with 18 delegates, but after Rubio dropped out of the race, his five delegates became free agents. Furthermore, Louisiana has five unbound delegates who are free to support the candidate of their choosing\u2014in this case, they\u2019re more likely to back Cruz. Thus, it was reported last week that Cruz could end up winning 10 more delegates than Trump.\n\nTrump took issue with that, however.\n\n\u201cWelcome to the Republican Party,\u201d he said on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week.\" \u201cWhat\u2019s going on in the Republican Party is a disgrace.\u201d\n\n\"I won Louisiana and now I hear he's trying to steal delegates,\" Trump said, referring to Cruz.\n\n\"I have so many more votes and so many more delegates,\" Trump continued. \"And, frankly, whoever at the end, whoever has the most votes and the most delegates should be the nominee.\"\n\nDespite Trump\u2019s fury over the fate of those Louisiana delegates, Cruz gaining the additional 10 delegates would not amount to \u201cstealing\u201d as the businessman suggests. It\u2019s just the name of the game--something Cruz spokesman Ron Nehring had to remind him of on Sunday evening.", "article_metadata": {"description": "It will go nowhere. .05/26/2016 11:02:39AM EST.", "author": "Leah Barkoukis", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "It will go nowhere.", "title": "Leah Barkoukis - Surprise: Trump Threatens Lawsuit Over Louisiana Delegates", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/leahbarkoukis/2016/03/28/surprise-trump-threatens-lawsuit-over-louisiana-delegates-n2139760", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2016/71/2016-03-11T054306Z_15_LYNXNPEC291AX_RTROPTP_3_USA-ELECTION-TRUMP.JPG", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "It will go nowhere.", "title": "Leah Barkoukis - Surprise: Trump Threatens Lawsuit Over Louisiana Delegates", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/leahbarkoukis/2016/03/28/surprise-trump-threatens-lawsuit-over-louisiana-delegates-n2139760", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2016/71/2016-03-11T054306Z_15_LYNXNPEC291AX_RTROPTP_3_USA-ELECTION-TRUMP.JPG", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Surprise: Trump Threatens Lawsuit Over Louisiana Delegates, Leah Barkoukis, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe12fc\"", "article_summary": "Despite Trump\u2019s fury over the fate of those Louisiana delegates, Cruz gaining the additional 10 delegates would not amount to \u201cstealing\u201d as the businessman suggests.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going on in the Republican Party is a disgrace.\u201d\"I won Louisiana and now I hear he's trying to steal delegates,\" Trump said, referring to Cruz.\n\"I have so many more votes and so many more delegates,\" Trump continued.\nThus, it was reported last week that Cruz could end up winning 10 more delegates than Trump.\nTrump took issue with that, however."}
