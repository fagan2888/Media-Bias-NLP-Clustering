In 2012 during a face-to-face interview with Obama, Ramos exposed the fact that the president did not make any progress on immigration reform during his first year in office despite his promise to do so.\n\n\u201cYou promised that,\u201d Ramos had told the president. \u201cA promise is a promise. And with all due respect, you didn\u2019t keep that promise.\u201d\n\nDuring an interview with NBC\u2019s Chuck Todd on \u201cMeet the Press\u201d Sunday, Obama said that saving the Democratic Senate was \u201cnot the reason\u201d for putting off any executive action on immigration. He also blamed the border crisis over the summer for his need to delay such executive action.\n\nH/T Mediaite", "article_metadata": {"generator": "NGFB Pro 7.8.4U", "og": {"site_name": "Red Alert Politics", "description": "Jorge Ramos, anchor for Fusion's America and himself an immigrant, slammed President Obama on Twitter Saturday following the president's decision to delay executive actions on immigration until after the midterm elections in November.", "title": "'America' anchor Jorge Ramos scolds Obama for delaying executive...", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 507, "identifier": "http://redalertpolitics.com/files/2014/09/jorge-ramos-507x400.jpg", "height": 400}, "url": "http://redalertpolitics.com/2014/09/07/america-anchor-jorge-ramos-scolds-obama-delaying-executive-action-immigration-midterm-elections/", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 1285945407, "app_id": 529886110401651}, "msvalidate.01": "0F003B4674EABE0F24651B476B61A43C", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/RedAlertPolitics", "tag": "obama-immigration-delay", "published_time": "2014-09-07T16:24:16+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-09-09T15:20:06+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "Now he won\u2019t.\u201d\u201cA promise is a promise/ Una promesa es una promesa,\u201d reads a tweet from a few minutes later.\nJorge Ramos, anchor for Fusion\u2019s \u201cAmerica\u201d and himself an immigrant, slammed President Obama on Twitter Saturday following the president\u2019s decision to delay executive actions on immigration until after the midterm elections in November.\n\u2014 JORGE RAMOS (@jorgeramosnews) September 6, 2014A promise is a promise/ Una promesa es una promesa \u2014 JORGE RAMOS (@jorgeramosnews) September 6, 2014This presidential delay means that more innocent people will be deported and more families separated.It's the triumph of partisan politics.\nAs Mediaite points out, this isn\u2019t the first time that Ramos has called out Obama for his broken promises on immigration.\n\u201cPresident @BarackObama once again delays action on immigration,\u201d tweeted Ramos."}
