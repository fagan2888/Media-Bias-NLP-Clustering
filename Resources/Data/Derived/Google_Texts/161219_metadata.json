Jeb Bush held his first telephone town hall with Granite Staters Tuesday night, calling for repeal of the Affordable Care Act, reform of Medicare for younger Americans, increasing the retirement age, and a concerted effort with Middle East allies to defeat Islamic terrorist groups.\n\nJeb Bush Jeb Bush (R) is a candidate for president in 2016. More\n\nThe Republican presidential candidate also called on Congress to build a veto proof majority and then reject President Barack Obama\u2019s nuclear weapons deal with Iran.\n\nBush took eight questions during the 45-minute call. While focusing on foreign and domestic policy, he also said that he is a \u201cdevout Catholic\u201d and would not shy away from allowing his faith to \u201cinform\u201d the way he would govern as president.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a Christian and it is something I don\u2019t put in a lock box in public life,\u201d Bush said. \u201cFaith matters and we should not push people of faith outside the mainstream.\u201d He also noted that there is now \u201creligious persecution as never before in the Middle East and some African nations.\u201d\n\n\u201cRadical Islam is challenging the ability of Christians who have had millennia of engagement in the Middle East to continue to exist,\u201d Bush said. \u201cThey are now being obliterated.\u201d\n\nOn domestic policy, Bush reiterated his goal of establishing 4 percent annual economic growth by addressing the immigration problem, cutting government spending and reducing the federal workforce. He said he has the experience to accomplish his goal based on his performance during his eight years as Florida\u2019s governor.\n\nBush said that as governor from 1999 to 2007, he cut taxes by $19 billion and the number of state employees by 13,000. He said his state \u201ccreated more businesses than any other state\u201d during his tenure.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019 are going to grow economically unless we also re-engage in the rest of the world,\u201d he said. \u201cWe lead from behind now. We talk about red lines in the sand. We create instability.\u201d\n\nBush told a Manchester veteran that the Islamic state, or ISIS, \u201cis a creation of a void that we created when we left Iraq.\u201d He called for arming the Kurds and rebuilding the alliance that created the successful surge in Iraq, which would include engaging and winning the support of Sunni tribal leaders.\n\n\u201cWe also need to be engaged politically in Iraq,\u201d Bush said. He also said he supported increasing U.S. air support in the area to \u201cdo it with certainty\u201d to defeat terrorist groups such as ISIS.\n\nHe also said the United States should re-establish a \u201ctake-it-to-the-bank kind of relationship with Israel.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to image how you could rupture the relationship between the United States and Israel the way this president has done,\u201d he said.\n\nBush called for reducing the federal deficit by fixing the legal immigration system \u201cto turn it into a catalyst for higher growth.\u201d He said the civil service system should be reformed and the \u201clobbyist system\u201d should be addressed.\n\n\u201cWe have to make a significant reform of Social Security and Medicare and entitlement programs,\u201d he said. He said the retirement age must be raised, and he suggested a review of income eligibility caps to ensure the solvency of Social Security.\n\nBush said the Affordable Care Act should be repealed and replaced with a health insurance program that promotes flexibility, is portable from job to job, and has both low deductibles and premiums.\n\nHe said that 40 percent of the 11 million to 12 million illegal immigrants in the United States \u201ccame here legally and overstayed their visas.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy not train local law enforcement to be the eyes and ears of local immigration authorities so we can pick up those who have overstayed their visas?\u201d Bush asked. \u201cComing here legally should be a heck of a lot easier than coming here illegally.\u201d\n\nHe also called for an e-verify system and said he would deny illegal immigrants government assistance such as Medicaid and food stamps.\n\nDuring the call, participants were asked if they plan to vote in the New Hampshire Primary and whether they support Bush, do not support him or are undecided.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Politics", "ib-analytics": "data", "item-publish-date": "Tue, 28 Jul 2015 20:31:06 EDT", "generator": "ibPublish 2", "author": "John DiStaso", "og": {"site_name": "WMUR", "description": "Former Florida Gov.
