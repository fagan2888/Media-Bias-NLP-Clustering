If police pay were more in line with national averages, hundreds more officers would be on the streets patrolling neighborhoods, stomping out the valley\u2019s dangerous driving culture and keeping the Strip even safer.\n\nLast year, when state lawmakers and the Clark County Commission were debating whether to authorize a sales tax increase to boost the department\u2019s operating budget, police and their union played aggressive defense when legitimate questions were asked about their compensation. The Nevada Policy Research Institute posted police salaries and benefits to TransparentNevada.com, which allowed the public to see how many officers were taking home six figures, and how many topped $200,000 in total compensation.\n\nIt\u2019s been obvious for years that all local governments, not just Metro, want tax increases not because they\u2019re cash poor, but because the state\u2019s collective bargaining laws ensure they have no control over their personnel costs. The bill just keeps going higher and higher. But the Las Vegas Police Protective Association told anyone who\u2019d listen that member salaries were not the problem.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how you can say they\u2019re inflated over the past years. They were not. And do I believe they were ever inflated? No. I do not,\u201d Chris Collins, executive director of the LVPPA, said last year in a telephone interview with Las Vegas\u2019 KTNV-TV, Channel 13.\n\nBut now it can be said with certainty that Las Vegas police have one of the best compensation packages in America. Don\u2019t take my word for it. Take the LVPPA\u2019s.\n\nIn the just-released September/October issue of Vegas Beat, the union\u2019s magazine (lvppa.com/vegas-beat/), Assistant Executive Director Mark Chaparian touts high officer pay and the union\u2019s role in growing police pay and benefits.\n\n\u201cThe LVPPA has worked tirelessly decade after decade to deliver lucrative contracts to its members, which has made Metro one of the best-paid police departments in the country,\u201d Chaparian wrote. \u201cI have spent hundreds of hours studying and researching police contracts across the nation, and Metro stands far above the majority.\u201d\n\nRegarding the union\u2019s medical benefits, Chaparian writes: \u201cThrough our collective bargaining process, we take the City of Las Vegas, Clark County and mighty Metro to task in order to secure money that can be spent on health care for you and your family. \u2026 This isn\u2019t Disneyland, so believe me when I tell you that their idea of health care is nothing like your idea of health care, or anything that remotely resembles what our membership would consider acceptable.\u201d\n\nYour health care benefits are eroding and getting more expensive, thanks to Obamacare. So how, exactly, is the union so successful in preserving member benefits? Chaparian goes on to explain the political process to members.\n\n\u201cPainstaking efforts are taken to filter, endorse, lobby, and support or oppose political candidates who impact our members on and off the job. The LVPPA is a significant contender in local and state politics. Politicians desperately seek our endorsement and support, and, in turn, we use them to achieve our goals.\u201d\n\nWe use them. That\u2019s instructive for voters, desperate candidates and taxpayers alike.\n\nNow, I\u2019m often branded as anti-cop and anti-public employee, but that\u2019s not true. I think it\u2019s especially important to pay police a good salary, but not because of the risks they face on the job \u2014 no one forces anyone to become a police officer. No, paying police poorly is an invitation for corruption. They have awesome powers: the ability to take away your liberty, to take your stuff, to suspend your rights, to use force against you. If you pay police and corrections officers dirt, they\u2019re susceptible to bribes from enterprising crooks.\n\nBut high police pay, and high public employee pay, comes at a cost. You can\u2019t have as many of them. And compensating them at levels that far outstrip those of taxpayers isn\u2019t sustainable.\n\nThe sales tax increase is on the shelf for now, but it will be back at some point. The state law that gives the County Commission the ability to enact a sales tax increase of up to 0.15 percentage points doesn\u2019t expire until 2016. At some point, commissioners will bring forward a new tax plan to increase police funding across the county.\n\nCommissioners should remember Chaparian\u2019s words when they vote on it.\n\nHashtags &Headlines\n\nAfter a summer hiatus, the Review-Journal\u2019s Hashtags &Headlines policy luncheon series resumes Monday with a panel discussion on statewide ballot Question 1. If approved by voters this fall, the constitutional amendment would create an intermediate appellate court to provide the Nevada Supreme Court with some relief from its crushing caseload.\n\nReview-Journal political columnist Steve Sebelius will moderate the discussion with Supreme Court Justice James Hardesty, retired Nevada Supreme Court Justice Bill Maupin, Nevada Attorney General Catherine Cortez Masto and UNLV Boyd School of Law Dean Daniel Hamilton.\n\nIf approved, how would the appellate court function? How much would it cost? And would it really help speed the appeals of District Court cases?\n\nThe luncheon runs from 11:30 a.m. to 1 p.m. at Texas Station\u2019s Houston Ballroom. Tickets cost $40 at the door. Hope to see you there.\n\nGlenn Cook (gcook@reviewjournal.com) is the Las Vegas Review-Journal\u2019s senior editorial writer. Follow him on Twitter: @Glenn_CookNV.
