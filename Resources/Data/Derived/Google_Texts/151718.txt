Tax filing season is underway, and this year there are several changes in effect that could affect your benefits.

Every new year brings changes in the tax code many people never notice. The Affordable Care Act has caused profound changes, affecting 30 million people nationwide.

"It is the law now that you have to have health insurance. If you don't have health insurance, you're going to be penalized unless you meet a number of different possible exemptions," said Tom Resnick, owner of Tax Frantic.

That penalty is $95 or one percent of your annual income.

There are more changes this year. For instance, bitcoin is taxable. If you receive payment or invested in virtual currency, you should include the fair market value of it with your income.

If you're a student, Pell Grants may now be allocated as a living expense.

If you're eligible, the number of income tax credits has increased.

Tax preparers say they usually have to make second appointments with clients because they usually forget something. You'll need your W-2 form and, if you purchased health insurance through Nevada Health Link, a 10-95 form.

You'll also need copies of your dependents' Social Security cards, your children's birth certificates and proof that your children live in your home.

Also, be sure to bring a copy of your previous tax return.

To be eligible for the Earned Income Tax Credit, you must make less than $47,000 a year if you have three children or $44,000 if you have two.

April 15 is the deadline to file taxes.
