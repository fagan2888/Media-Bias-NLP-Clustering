In some ways, the public reaction has been predictable; all have expressed outrage, disgust, sadness, following a post-massacre routine that has become depressingly familiar. In at least one way, however, the response from America\u2019s mostly-white mainstream has been something it usually isn\u2019t, especially isn\u2019t when it comes to race: genuinely introspective.\n\nThe most obvious manifestation of this collective soul-searching is the sudden toxicity of the Confederate battle flag, and the calls for its removal from government property. The demand has come not only from liberal activists and people of color but, more surprisingly, from Southern Republican politicians and multinational corporations, too. For the first time in many years, perhaps ever, it seems like many white Americans are willing to reassess not only the Confederate battle flag, but the influence white supremacy still holds over their society.\n\nThat this process has unfolded in the run-up to the Fourth of July strikes me as especially appropriate. No other holiday is endowed with the same kind of Americanness (though there\u2019s a strong case to be made that Super Bowl Sunday, an unofficial holiday, comes close). No other holiday so clearly elevates secular values, such as liberty and self-government, to almost metaphysical heights. If there\u2019s one day of the year when Americans collectively remind themselves of who they are and what they profess to believe, Independence Day is it.\n\nThis is a good thing, in many ways. For Americans who don\u2019t regularly participate in organized religion, the Fourth of July is a rare moment of unity, one of the precious few times every year when an increasingly balkanized society coalesces into a single, shared experience. But the Fourth of July has its problems, ones connected to the evolution of America\u2019s self-perception, of which the debate over the Confederate battle flag is a part.\n\nSimply put, while it\u2019s intended to be a day to honor the fundamental values motivating the American experiment \u2014 liberty, independence, justice and self-determination \u2014 the promise of Independence Day is not for all Americans. It never has been and it never will be. For nearly 100 years following July 4, 1776, there were millions of Americans whose lives were the antithesis of free, and for whom justice, equality and self-determination were effectively fantasy and myth. These people \u2014 the chattel slaves of the American South \u2014 were not just unfree when compared to their white compatriots; they were among the most unfree and maltreated people in the history of the world.\n\nThis is why establishing the Fourth of July as a de facto \u201cAmerica Day\u201d is so incoherent. It\u2019s true that something calling itself the United States of America asserted its independence during the summer of 1776; but the country I\u2019ve lived in for my whole life is not it. In some sense, my country \u2014 a multiethnic, pluralist, secular and democratic republic \u2014 only came into being during the civil rights struggle of the mid-20th century. Yet even if we aren\u2019t so exacting in our standards, today\u2019s America came into being during the Civil War, not the War of Independence.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The black fight for freedom is the key American narrative -- and the U.S. as we know it is younger than you think", "title": "America\u2019s real founding moment: Why we get Independence Day all wrong", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The black fight for freedom is the key American narrative -- and the U.S. as we know it is younger than you think", "title": "America\u2019s real founding moment: Why we get Independence Day all wrong", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/07/04/americas_real_founding_moment_why_we_get_independence_day_all_wrong/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/07/mlk_washington.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The black fight for freedom is the key American narrative -- and the U.S. as we know it is younger than you think", "title": "America\u2019s real founding moment: Why we get Independence Day all wrong", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/07/mlk_washington.jpg", "creator": "@eliasisquith", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Elias Isquith", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, American Revolution, chattel salvery, Civil War, confederate flag, Editor's Picks, Fourth of July, Independence Day, July 4, juneteenth, slavery, war of independence, white supremacism, White Supremacy", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "If there\u2019s one day of the year when Americans collectively remind themselves of who they are and what they profess to believe, Independence Day is it.\nYet even if we aren\u2019t so exacting in our standards, today\u2019s America came into being during the Civil War, not the War of Independence.\nSimply put, while it\u2019s intended to be a day to honor the fundamental values motivating the American experiment \u2014 liberty, independence, justice and self-determination \u2014 the promise of Independence Day is not for all Americans.\nThis is why establishing the Fourth of July as a de facto \u201cAmerica Day\u201d is so incoherent.\nThe most obvious manifestation of this collective soul-searching is the sudden toxicity of the Confederate battle flag, and the calls for its removal from government property."}
