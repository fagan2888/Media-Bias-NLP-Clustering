Major candidates so far have already tried or have promised to repeal the landmark health care law, and opposing it promises to be a popular selling point in the 2016 elections.\n\nBehind all the rhetoric, however, are several thornier issues, including whether candidates could offer a feasible alternative to the Affordable Care Act, often referred to as Obamacare, and whether they\u2019d be able, as president, to fulfill campaign promises to repeal the law, which experts describe as increasingly entrenched in the American health care system. Despite these obstacles, voicing opposition to Obamacare is all but a given for GOP candidates, especially in advance of the 2016 primaries, which tend to attract far-right voters.\n\n\u201cGetting rid of [Obamacare] is going to be a key issue,\u201d said Dan Judy, a Republican pollster with North Star Opinion Research, which is working on Sen. Marco Rubio\u2019s presidential campaign. \u201cCandidates are going to look at this and say, \u2018This is bad policy. Here\u2019s a law you don\u2019t like. If Hilary Clinton is elected, it will stay; if I\u2019m elected, it will go.\u2019 \u201d\n\nSo far, declared and expected candidates have fervently and vocally opposed Obamacare. \u201cImagine in 2017 a new president signing legislation repealing every word of Obamacare,\u201d Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas told an audience at Liberty University in Lynchburg, Virginia, in announcing his candidacy for president. Cruz also spearheaded efforts in 2013 to defund Obamacare that ultimately led to a government shutdown.\n\nFlorida Sen. Marco Rubio, another candidate, was also a part of those efforts in 2013. Most recently, in March, he proposed a plan to replace Obamacare if the government loses in the Supreme Court case King v. Burwell, which could cost residents of certain states federal subsidies crucial in offsetting the cost of health insurance. A decision on the case is expected in June or July.\n\nContinue Reading Below\n\nFormer Florida Gov. Jeb Bush hasn\u2019t officially announced that he\u2019s running, but he has called for replacing Obamacare, and in March, he declared Obamacare \u201cthe greatest job suppressor\u201d after 2008.\n\nKentucky Sen. Rand Paul, a declared candidate, wrote on Facebook in August, \"I won't rest until ObamaCare is 100% repealed.\" He also, however, acknowledged that it would be difficult to repeal the legislation.\n\nDemocratic candidate Hillary Clinton, on the other hand, has been a staunch supporter of Obamacare. \"Repeal of the ACA would let insurers write their own rules again, and wipe out coverage for 16 million Americans,\" she wrote on Twitter in March.\n\nA New Health Care Landscape\n\nJust because candidates are clamoring to undo Obamacare, however, doesn\u2019t mean they can. Not only is the law increasingly rooted in the American health care system, but any attempt to repeal the ACA would also likely require Republicans to keep or win a certain number of seats in Congress in the 2016 elections, if a Republican president was behind it.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got a lot of people who have coverage that they\u2019re growing used to,\u201d said Michael Sparer, a professor of health policy and management at the Mailman School of Public Health at Columbia University in New York. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re happy with their coverage \u2026 but they\u2019ve got coverage.\" Insurance companies, employers, hospitals and doctors have all begun adapting to the Affordable Care Act, and \u201cto simply pull the plug on that, I think there\u2019s going to be a lot of resistance,\u201d Sparer added.\n\nPromises to eliminate Obamacare must come with actual alternatives to the law, experts pointed out. \u201cThe best way for potential Republican candidates to argue for repealing Obamacare would be with a relatively detailed alternative health reform plan,\u201d Rick Mayes, an associate professor of political science and co-director of the healthcare studies major at the University of Richmond in Virginia, said. \u201cIn other words, suggest a better model or path for reform.\u201d\n\nJudy, the Republican pollster, said the same. \u201cWhat do we replace it with?\u201d he asked. Having not just a plan to repeal but also something to replace Obamacare would be key, he added, even though he said it was too early for candidates to have devised specific proposals for an alternative.\n\nRepealing the law would be contingent upon other outcomes in the 2016 elections. Republicans would have to maintain a majority in the House and would probably have to expand their majority in the Senate, and so in terms of promising to repeal Obamacare, \u201cwhether or not this can be kept based on the political reality remains to be seen,\u201d Judy said.\n\nA Republican Requirement\n\n\u201cRepeal of the ACA has become simply a given for all Republican candidates,\u201d Joseph White, a professor of public policy at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, said in an email. \u201cIt has become an article of faith among Republicans that \u2018Obamacare\u2019 represents everything that has gone wrong with the country.\"\n\nThe fact that candidates are competing for the Republican nomination first, instead of a general election, also affects the degree of fervor. \u201cAny sort of primary draws the most partisan voters on both sides,\u201d Sparer said. \u201cOpposition [to Obamacare] resonates strongly with a large segment of the population, especially the more partisan Republicans, who are more likely to be engaged and active in the upcoming primaries.\"\n\nThere\u2019s also the belief that supporting Obamacare could cost a candidate an election. In Colorado during the 2014 midterm elections, Republican Cory Gardner campaigned on a strong anti-Obamacare platform that included claiming that incumbent Democratic Senator Mark Udall had cast the deciding vote that passed Obamacare. Although the truth of that statement is disputed, Gardner ultimately unseated Udall, and so for GOP candidates, anything less than outright opposition to Obamacare may not be an option.\n\nPublic opinion on what the Affordable Care Act provides or has achieved so far is divided. In March, a Kaiser Health Tracking Poll found that 41 percent of respondents viewed the health care law favorably, while 43 percent viewed it unfavorably. Nevertheless, some surveys also suggest that Americans generally favor changing Obamacare instead of repealing it entirely, with more than half of respondents in a Rasmussen poll in December saying they would rather have the law improved and only 30 percent supporting a full repeal.\n\nBut despite the law\u2019s apparent lack of popular support, the rate of uninsured people in the U.S. is at an all-time low of 11.9 percent, a poll released Monday showed, and experts suggest that one reason Americans oppose the law is that they don\u2019t fully understand it. In the middle of 2013, before the health insurance exchanges established by the law went into effect, an estimated 18 percent to 20 percent of American adults lacked health insurance.\n\nPete Damiano, director of the Public Policy Center at the University of Iowa, said that according to the center\u2019s surveys of consumers, \u201cwhen you ask them about the various pieces and parts of the Affordable Care Act, like keeping people on their parents\u2019 plans \u2026 there\u2019s pretty much universal support,\u201d Damiano said. It\u2019s when people are asked about their feelings about the law overall that they start to dislike it, he explained, and \u201ceven though they like the pieces and parts, because of the political rhetoric, there\u2019s a lot of confusion.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://s2.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/themes/us_ibtimes/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "obamacare, 2016 presidential elections, republican hopefuls presidential elections, repeal obamacare, affordable care act, repeal affordable care act, how to repeal obamacare, opposition to obamacare, republicans trying to repeal obamacare, jeb bush, ted", "og": {"site_name": "International Business Times", "description": "Voicing opposition to Obamacare is all but a given for GOP candidates.", "title": "2016 Republicans On Obamacare: For GOP Presidential Hopefuls, Repealing Affordable Care Act May Be Easier Said Than Done", "url": "http://www.ibtimes.com/2016-republicans-obamacare-gop-presidential-hopefuls-repealing-affordable-care-act-1885065", "image": "http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/2015/04/16/rtr4uipj.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Voicing opposition to Obamacare is all but a given for GOP candidates.", "title": "2016 Republicans On Obamacare: For GOP Presidential Hopefuls, Repealing Affordable Care Act May Be Easier Said Than Done", "url": "http://www.ibtimes.com/2016-republicans-obamacare-gop-presidential-hopefuls-repealing-affordable-care-act-1885065", "image": {"src": "http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/2015/04/16/rtr4uipj.jpg", "identifier": "http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/2015/04/16/rtr4uipj.jpg"}, "site": "@IBTimes", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#000000", "fb": {"app_id": 263851690471857, "pages": 128026713884051}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/themes/us_ibtimes/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/IBTimes", "section": "World", "published_time": "2015-04-16T14:01:39-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-04-17T01:15:40-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Voicing opposition to Obamacare is all but a given for GOP candidates."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd08c\"", "article_summary": "Public opinion on what the Affordable Care Act provides or has achieved so far is divided.\nAs Republican presidential hopefuls vie to persuade voters that they are uniquely qualified to lead America, they are united in their opposition to one thing: the Affordable Care Act.\nIn March, a Kaiser Health Tracking Poll found that 41 percent of respondents viewed the health care law favorably, while 43 percent viewed it unfavorably.\nInsurance companies, employers, hospitals and doctors have all begun adapting to the Affordable Care Act, and \u201cto simply pull the plug on that, I think there\u2019s going to be a lot of resistance,\u201d Sparer added.\nA New Health Care LandscapeJust because candidates are clamoring to undo Obamacare, however, doesn\u2019t mean they can."}
