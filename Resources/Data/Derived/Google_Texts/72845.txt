A video of a New Jersey EMT rocking out to Rihanna while driving an ambulance has gotten more than 1 million hits — and has landed its star in some hot water.

The video, posted to YouTube May 6, shows EMT Jonathan Williams talking with an associate over his radio when a remix of the song "Pour It Up" comes on the radio, prompting the driver to scream and dance along.

Williams was first identified by CBS New York.

Williams, who works for a private ambulance company not identified in the CBS story, said he was on his way home when the video was recorded and would never dance like that with a patient on board. Still, he said he was reprimanded by his employer.

But the attention Williams received wasn't all negative — Rihanna tweeted out a link to her 35 million followers, saying, "This Paramedic guy just reminded me why God sent me here! I can't stop now! Not now, not nevah!!!!"

Williams told CBS that he was flabbergasted by the reaction from Rihanna.

“Totally, utterly flabbergasted,” he said.
