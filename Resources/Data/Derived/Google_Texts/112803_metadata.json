It is a place, after all, that Hunter S. Thompson called \u201cthe Carnegie Hall of public sex in America.\u201d A place known in the \u201970s for drugs, fully nude lap dances and live sex shows. But Liberty Bradford Mitchell spent plenty of her childhood visiting her father, Artie Mitchell, at the legendary San Francisco strip club. She was introduced to porn and G-strings before kindergarten.\n\nIncredibly, that is perhaps the least remarkable aspect of her family history. Artie and brother Jim directed and produced the 1972 porn classic \u201cBehind the Green Door,\u201d infamously starring Ivory Snow girl Marilyn Chambers. They produced porn upstairs at the O\u2019Farrell, showed the films downstairs and eventually introduced live entertainment. As a result, they fought more than 200 obscenity cases \u2014 when they weren\u2019t partying and making millions. In the end, Jim shot Artie dead with a rifle, for reasons that remain unclear.\n\nSomewhat unsurprisingly, Bradford Mitchell has swung in the opposite direction of her father. She\u2019s a fan of the work of controversial psychologist Melissa Farley, a self-described prostitution abolitionist. She feels passionately about the blight of sex trafficking, which she ties to the adult industry. Needless to say, she is no fan of pornography. At the same time, she speaks highly of the Mitchell brothers\u2019 work and allows, \u201cI\u2019m all for whatever floats your boat, as long as everyone involved is safe and consenting.\u201d It isn\u2019t easy to find one\u2019s own identity in the shadow of an infamous father.\n\nShe\u2019s turned her personal story into a one-woman show, \u201cThe Pornographer\u2019s Daughter,\u201d which is currently playing in San Francisco. Salon spoke with Mitchell by phone about what it\u2019s like to be exposed to porn at such a young age, her feelings about her father\u2019s legacy and how she\u2019s made sense of his murder.\n\nWhen did you first find out what your dad did for a living?\n\n\n\nI remember having an awareness of it when I was around 3 or 4 that he made naked movies, which I thought was really hilarious. I think I imagined more like naked cartoons or something.\n\nWhen was the first time that you saw pornography?\n\n\n\nGrowing up, I\u2019d go to the O\u2019Farrell Theater, we\u2019d stop by the office when we were in the city. When I was 4 and a half, I became really cognizant of what I was viewing on the screen in the screening room. I describe that experience in the play of the first time I locked in on a full-screen close-up of a penis and vagina in coitus. I thought, \u201cWhat are they doing? This is not what I thought a naked movie would look like.\u201d At the time it wasn\u2019t so disturbing to me, it was just very weird.\n\nOnce I was the age of 6 or 7 I was much more conscious that this was not stuff that I should be seeing and it did not make me comfortable when I was by the office, especially at the point where the theater went live and there were dancers that were basically naked walking around. None of it was really explained to me. There was no thoughtful conversation about sexuality and pornography and its role in the world. Especially when I was much younger, I think my father figured, \u201cOh, she doesn\u2019t even know what she\u2019s looking at.\u201d That was true, for a good amount of time.\n\nI know now that was the culture of the \u201970s. A lot of kids were reared in the \u201970s with progressive parents \u2014 they lived on nudist colonies or communes. There was a lot of interesting experimental living going on in those days.\n\nDid you have classmates at school who knew who your dad was?\n\n\n\nVery few. I kept it very secret. I did have a best friend in fourth grade who knew. Once I was in junior high, I was completely closeted about what my dad did. I changed my name, I was very shy. I was not in a space to stand up and be brave and say, \u201cMy dad\u2019s a pornographer, big deal.\u201d\n\nIt was complicated. I loved my father. We had a lot of fun as a family. We had a lot of dysfunction as well \u2014 but who didn\u2019t in divorced California families of the \u201970s?\n\nHow did that early exposure to porn and stripping influence you?\n\n\n\nI personally was very inhibited sexually for a long time. I retreated and read little English novels, watched \u201cLittle House on the Prairie\u201d and just found the most mainstream or traditional media outlets. I didn\u2019t feel comfortable, I was a late bloomer. It wasn\u2019t until college when I started to get more comfortable with myself and that coincided with coming out of the closet to my peers about what my dad did. Of course, by that time they all thought it was cool, it was great! \u201cMy dad\u2019s job is so boring, he\u2019s just a banker!\u201d\n\nI\u2019ve read that you would sometimes take your college friends to the O\u2019Farrell.\n\n\n\nYep. It started out being really fun because the office at the O\u2019Farrell is pretty legendary for being a great place to party. There was always plenty of booze and pot. That was really fun. I\u2019d go downstairs as a lark to take a look, but I wasn\u2019t really interested in the shows. My girlfriends and I\u2019d be hanging out upstairs. The hours would pass and the sun goes down and my male friends come back with this depraved look in their eyes and I was like, \u201cGod, what happened to you people when you were downstairs?\u201d\n\nI saw them all sink into this disgusting depravity where every women in the room becomes a target. It became this entitlement that the men had and it made me sick. I remember grilling my [male] friend for the five-and-a-half hours we drove back from San Francisco to L.A. \u201cWhat is wrong with males? Why does this happen?\u201d It\u2019s not like women don\u2019t get hot over seeing good-looking guys or women, whoever they\u2019re turned on by, but it\u2019s just not this weird animal instinct. I found it so disturbing and disappointing. All my friend could do was apologize for his own sex and go, \u201cI dunno, that\u2019s just how we are. We\u2019re visually stimulated.\u201d I came to understand, because obviously my father wouldn\u2019t have made millions and millions of dollars if there hadn\u2019t been this market of men wiling to pay a premium to look at naked women.", "article_metadata": {"description": "What's it like seeing stripping and porn at age 4?
