The Panama City Swim Team absolutely knows that is truth. That's why they're excited to be opening their long course season at the Aquatic Center at Frank Brown Park, hosting the PCST Paradise Invitational Meet.\n\n\"Oh it's great,\" said PCST head coach Brian Haddad. \"It's a great way to kick off the season, it's a great way to get kids back into competing. It was a long short course season. We had a great one. We took a nice break, but it's time to get back to work competing and it offers us a chance to see where we are, what we've improved on, what we need to continue to improve on, and set the tone for the summer.\"\n\n410 swimmers as young as five to as old as 21 are competing on 15 different teams, traveling as close as Bay County or as far as Boston. The strong reputation of PCST is a big reason for the huge turnout.\n\n\"Just living in our area, hospitality is one of the things that we're most proud of,\" said Haddad. \"And so, we try to translate that over to swim meets as well. We're real hospitable to the teams coming in. We try to make it an experience they enjoy, that their kids have a good tim - not just going to the beach, but also competing in the pool.\"\n\nCompetition wrapped Saturday around 8 PM and will continue Sunday at 8 AM, before closing out around 3:30 PM.", "article_metadata": {"medium": "video", "description": "Panama City Beach, FL---There's no place like home.
