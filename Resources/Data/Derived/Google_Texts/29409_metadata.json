He coordinated a survey of 230 NABE members that showed 30 percent said it would hurt, 18 percent said it would help, and 42 percent said the ACA would have no impact on economic growth.\n\nThe fact that the ACA has no impact on economic growth doesn\u2019t mean the ACA has no impact at all. For one thing, it will encourage a lot of people to buy health insurance \u2013 the number of uninsured people will fall by 25 million over the next 10 years. For another, it will increase the government\u2019s role in the economy \u2014 the federal government will spend about $2 trillion on insurance subsidies and so forth and collect about $500 billion from penalties and taxes for a net cost of $1.5 trillion over the next 10 years, according to the Congressional Budget Office.\n\nOne expert took issue with portraying the ACA\u2019s insurance coverage provisions as increasing the federal deficit. As Bob Doherty, senior vice president of Governmental Affairs and Public Policy at the American College of Physicians, pointed out in an e-mail to me: \u201cAlthough it is technically true that the costs of the insurance subsidies are greater than the revenue from the insurance coverage provisions, the overall impact of the ACA is to reduce \u2014 not increase \u2014 the deficit when all other provisions (revenue, cost reductions) are taken into account.\u201d He added that the typical lay person might conclude that the ACA increases the deficit even though the CBO found that the ACA lowers the deficit after taking into account all of its provisions.\n\nAs he highlighted to me, \u201cSurveys consistently show that the public\u2019s views of the ACA are more negative if they believe it adds to the deficit and more positive if they are told it reduces the deficit.\u201d\n\nWell said, Bob. It\u2019s a bad idea to give the wrong impression.\n\nIn fact, the ACA reduces the deficit \u201csignificantly over the next decade and massively in the decade after,\u201d as Jonathan Gruber, an economics professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, told me in an e-mail.\n\nPoint taken. The ACA does increase government spending and it does increase government revenue, but it does not increase the federal budget deficit.\n\nWith that settled, let\u2019s turn to another impact of the ACA.\n\nThe CBO estimated that the ACA would lead to 2.5 million fewer workers by 2024 as people voluntarily leave their jobs because they\u2019re no longer locked to that job just to obtain health insurance or choose to work less so they may qualify for insurance subsidies, and as employers reduce their demand for workers due to higher taxes.\n\nThis report set off a firestorm fueled, in part, by the work of University of Chicago economist Casey B. Mulligan, who became \u201cThe Economist Who Exposed ObamaCare,\u201d according to The Wall Street Journal, because of his \u201cconclusion that ObamaCare will, in fact, harm growth and jobs.\u201d\n\nSo, what did Mulligan say about how the Affordable Care Act affects jobs?\n\nNothing really controversial. In a piece titled \u201cDemoralization Is Not a Policy Achievement\u201d in The New York Times, Mulligan wrote that whether it\u2019s been through mortgage modification programs, extended unemployment benefits, or the ACA, the federal government has been reducing the \u201creward to working\u201d by introducing policies that cut benefits as work hours increase.\n\nCase in point: Under the ACA, the less you make, the more you get in insurance subsidies. Of course, this doesn\u2019t mean that everyone prefers receiving government benefits to having a job, but it\u2019s also plausible that some people do.\n\nThis isn\u2019t such good news, so I asked Mulligan how can the government help low-income people buy insurance if it doesn\u2019t give them subsidies, and if the government doesn\u2019t base subsidies on income, how can it avoid giving benefits to people who don\u2019t need them?\n\nMulligan sees things as quite simple, as he explained in an e-mail to me. \u201cThe primary reason that people work is to buy stuff for their families: food, shelter, healthcare, schooling, etc. If people can get some of that stuff without working, we don\u2019t expect as many people to work. The reason why workers had more incentives to work before the ACA is that people above the poverty line had to work to pay for their healthcare, or go without. There\u2019s no way around the basic fact that work is rewarding only if there\u2019s something valuable that workers get that non-workers do not.\u201d\n\nIt seems clear where Mulligan stands on this issue. Yet, not all economists agree with these dire predictions on work effort. One of these is the MIT economist who The New York Times nicknamed \u201cMr. Mandate\u201d for his role in insisting that the health reform proposal had to require people to buy insurance for it to succeed.\n\nJon Gruber is more than Mr. Mandate, however. Gruber helped design both Romneycare in Massachusetts and Obamacare and is smart enough to know that taxes and subsidies do affect a person\u2019s incentive to work. Where he disagrees with Mulligan, however, is over how important those incentives are. Gruber argues that the ACA\u2019s beneficial impact on labor productivity is more important than the disincentive to work created by the phase out of tax breaks as income increases.\n\nAs Gruber said to me in an e-mail, minimizing the work disincentives while also giving benefits to people who need them \u201cis the inherent tradeoff.\u201d\n\nIn a world where we can\u2019t have it all, how should we balance fairness and efficiency?\n\nAgain, I turned to the experts and asked how we should evaluate whether fairness mandates that the U.S. provide subsidized health insurance even at the expense of economic efficiency.\n\nElise Gould, a Ph.D. economist who directs health policy research at the Economic Policy Institute in Washington, told me in an e-mail that \u201cFairness in health care is about what kind of society we would like to create for ourselves. Efficiency is about making sure that health care is provided in a timely and cost-effective manner. The ACA promotes both fairness . . . by making health care more accessible and affordable . . . and efficiency in various ways, such as increasing the availability of preventive medicine, reducing the use of last resort health care (ER visits) relative to health maintenance and treatment at earlier stages of illness.\u201d\n\nThose are good points, but I still wanted to know whether the U.S. has a moral obligation to provide health insurance.\n\n\u201cDo we have a moral obligation to provide health care to people who would otherwise die in the streets?\u201d Gould asked. \u201cUnabashedly, I say yes and would venture to guess that most people would as well.\u201d\n\nTo Gruber, the issue isn\u2019t really so much about whether people have health insurance, but whether they have financial protection. \u201cThe major moral issue here is that we are the only developed country in the world that subjects our citizens to the financial risk of medical bankruptcy,\u201d Gruber said, adding that \u201cthat [risk] ended on January 1\u201d when the ACA came into effect.\n\nTrue, but there\u2019s more to consider. Mulligan wondered whether a \u201cmoral system that completely disregards the real costs that the ACA has been, and will be, imposing on people through no fault of their own,\u201d is justified, noting that plenty of people have already lost their insurance coverage or will be put out of work by the Affordable Care Act.\n\nWhereas George Washington University sophomore Atticus Franken had said that providing health insurance is morally \u201cthe right thing to do,\u201d Mulligan wondered whether our moral system is one that says that we \u201cabsolutely have to do something without regard to what it costs or even without regard to whether it\u2019s feasible.\u201d\n\nSo, where do we stand now that we have the college kids\u2019 and the experts\u2019 views?\n\nYou tell me.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Economists disagree about whether the benefits of Obamacare exceed the costs", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Economists disagree about whether the benefits of Obamacare exceed the costs", "title": "Experts disagree about job losses and the moral status of Obamacare", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/she-the-people/wp/2014/02/26/experts-disagree-about-job-losses-and-the-moral-status-of-obamacare/", "image": "https://images.washingtonpost.com/?url=http://img.washingtonpost.com/blogs/she-the-people/files/2014/02/Obama-signature-150x150.jpg&w=1484&op=resize&opt=1&filter=antialias", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@DCEcon"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/she-the-people/wp/2014/02/26/experts-disagree-about-job-losses-and-the-moral-status-of-obamacare/", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "Obamacare, Casey Mulligan, Jonathan Gruber, Health insurance subsidies, Affordable Care Act,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "Obamacare, Casey Mulligan, Jonathan Gruber, Health insurance subsidies, Affordable Care Act,"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb706\"", "article_summary": "\u201cDo we have a moral obligation to provide health care to people who would otherwise die in the streets?\u201d Gould asked.\nEfficiency is about making sure that health care is provided in a timely and cost-effective manner.\nAgain, I turned to the experts and asked how we should evaluate whether fairness mandates that the U.S. provide subsidized health insurance even at the expense of economic efficiency.\nFor one thing, it will encourage a lot of people to buy health insurance \u2013 the number of uninsured people will fall by 25 million over the next 10 years.\nThe fact that the ACA has no impact on economic growth doesn\u2019t mean the ACA has no impact at all."}
