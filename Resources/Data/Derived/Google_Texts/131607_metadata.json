If it gets a vote \u2014 and Dem leaders plan to push hard for one \u2014 it will put members of both parties on record as to whether they support national action to dramatically expand the availability of child care to poor and working families.\n\nThe proposal \u2014 to be introduced this week by Senator Bob Casey of Pennsylvania \u2014 is called the Strong Start for America\u2019s Children Amendment, and Casey plans to introduce it as an amendment to a measure reauthorizing and overhauling No Child Left Behind, which will be debated in the Senate starting tomorrow.\n\nThe new universal pre-K proposal is meant to function as a federal-state partnership. It would provide over $30 billion in federal block-grant funding, over five years, to states that provide high quality, universally available pre-school programs to four-year-olds from families earning less than 200 percent of the Federal Poverty Level, or $48,000 for a family of four. Any state that already has such a program can use the money to expand it to three-year-olds; states could also provide subgrants to local governments that establish pre-K programs that meet predetermined standards.\n\nThe program would be funded by the scaling back of \u201ccorporate inversions,\u201d in which companies declare that their U.S. operations are owned by a subsidiary abroad, resulting in profits being shifted to places where they are taxed at lower rates. The proposal would reconstitute an earlier Dem proposal that would require companies to be at least 50-percent foreign owned to use the technique, rather than the current requirement that it only be 20-percent foreign owned, lowering the incentive for companies to resort to the practice, which members of both parties have condemned.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to dis-incentivize what most public officials agree is a bad practice \u2014 corporate inversions,\u201d Senator Casey tells me. \u201cBut we\u2019re also boosting something that officials and corporate leaders say they favor, which is investing in early learning.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had states make substantial progress on early learning over the past 20 to 25 years,\u201d Casey adds. \u201cBut on the federal level there really hasn\u2019t been a strategic commitment to it. This will adversely impact wage growth, competitiveness and GDP growth. If we\u2019re going to talk about jobs and wages, it starts with early learning. Studies show a link between learning and earning \u2014 if kids learn more now, they\u2019ll earn more later.\u201d\n\nA senior Dem leadership aide tells me that this will be a \u201ckey amendment\u201d for Democratic leaders, adding: \u201cwe intend to push hard to get a vote.\u201d This could conceivably be helped, this aide notes, by the fact that Republicans, too, want to vote on amendments.\n\nNow, obviously the proposal may not end up getting a vote, and even if it does, it almost certainly won\u2019t pass the GOP-controlled Senate. \u201cIt\u2019s an uphill climb,\u201d Casey concedes. \u201cFor some reason there\u2019s a gap between what CEOs of large corporations tell us they believe is good for the workforce and the economy \u2014 investments in early learning \u2014 and how Republicans vote. Obviously we have work to do with Republicans, and I hope business leaders will continue to make the case to them.\u201d\n\nBut it would nonetheless be a mistake to dismiss this as merely a \u201cmessage vote\u201d or a political stunt. That\u2019s because universal child care is fast becoming a top priority of progressives and Democrats. It is a major policy idea in two of the leading progressive policy blueprints \u2014 the Center for American Progress\u2019s \u201cInclusive Prosperity\u201d agenda and the Roosevelt Institute\u2019s call for a deep structural overhaul of the rules under-girding the American economy. Both see expanded child care as crucial to removing added barriers to women participating in the workforce. Obama has pushed it; Hillary Clinton will likely make it key to her presidential run.\n\nAs Jonathan Chait detailed in a good piece, Dems will continue to push for quality universal child care as the \u201cnext major goal of American liberalism.\u201d It brings together several elements of current liberal thought: The idea that social changes resulting in more women entering the workforce have left working families with limited child care options, with disastrous results; and the notion that improving early education pays economic dividends later. Chait concludes:\n\nIn addition to its emerging status as party doctrine, early childhood education solves several of Hillary Clinton\u2019s messaging problems at once. Affordable child care as a social issue appeals to the working poor all the way through to the upper middle class. It lends policy heft to her status as potentially the first female president in American history. And it would undergird a forward-looking economic program, simultaneously attacking the problem of stagnant opportunity for working parents and their children. It took 65 years from the time Harry Truman proposed universal health care for Obama to sign a law actualizing his vision. Universal child care may not happen in the next presidential administration, which will begin with the same implacable Republican Congress that makes Obama\u2019s proposal dead on arrival. But it will eventually happen, and probably in less time.\n\nIf so, the Democrats\u2019 push for the current version of the proposal is best seen as one small step in a long, long process.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Senate Dems gear up to push a new universal pre-kindergarten proposal.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/WashingtonPostPlumLine?ref=hl", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Senate Dems gear up to push a new universal pre-kindergarten proposal.", "title": "The next big liberal cause: universal child care", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/07/06/the-next-big-liberal-cause-universal-child-care/", "image": "https://images.washingtonpost.com/?url=http://img.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/files/2013/07/Capitol__Fiscal_Cliff_03074-1705_new.jpg&w=1484&op=resize&opt=1&filter=antialias", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@theplumlinegs"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/07/06/the-next-big-liberal-cause-universal-child-care/", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "obama, hillary clinton, universal pre-K, universal child care, senate democrats, bob casey, senate republicans, 2016 presidential race", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/WashingtonPostPlumLine?ref=hl"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "obama, hillary clinton, universal pre-K, universal child care, senate democrats, bob casey, senate republicans, 2016 presidential race"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe358b\"", "article_summary": "That\u2019s because universal child care is fast becoming a top priority of progressives and Democrats.\nBoth see expanded child care as crucial to removing added barriers to women participating in the workforce.\nUniversal child care may not happen in the next presidential administration, which will begin with the same implacable Republican Congress that makes Obama\u2019s proposal dead on arrival.\nAffordable child care as a social issue appeals to the working poor all the way through to the upper middle class.\nUniversal child care is becoming a central pillar of the liberal agenda \u2014 one that, if it is ever realized, could take its place alongside some of the great progressive reforms of the 20th Century, and possibly the Affordable Care Act, as a defining achievement of the Democratic Party."}
