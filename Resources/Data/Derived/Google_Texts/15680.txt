An hour into their 6 year old daughter’s non-stop temper tantrum, a mom was losing her mind, so dad decided to lighten the mood by lip-syncing the entire thing.

It’s pretty funny, and dad is awfully hot. (As always on the weekends, I’m posting light videos unless some big story breaks, otherwise we’ll be back to ragging on Teabaggers on Monday.)

Mom reports that the daughter is actually a really good kid who was having a particularly bad day.

Oh, and did I mention that dad is awfully hot?
