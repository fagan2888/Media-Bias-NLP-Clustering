Neil Abercrombie, D-Hawaii, signed House Bill 2053 into law this week, which creates the new fall prevention and early detection coordinator position within the Department of Health\u2019s Emergency Medical Services and Injury Prevention branch.\n\nThe Department of Health already has a volunteer coordinator but believes the full-time position will help Hawaii\u2019s seniors remain healthy, productive and active and\u2014ultimately\u2014 ave taxpayers money.\n\nLawmakers backing the plan note Hawaii\u2019s population of senior citizens grew 116 percent during the past two decades\u2014more than double the national pace of 47 percent. What\u2019s more, Hawaii\u2019s population of people 65 and older is expected to reach 20 percent of the population by 2030.\n\nSome 8,700 of Hawaii\u2019s senior citizens go to the emergency room each year, costing the state $10 million annually in transportation alone. Another $90 million is spent on emergency room and hospital visits for seniors who took serious falls in which they broke their hips or hit their heads, with rehabilitation costs of about another $90 million.\n\nSenate Human Services Committee Chair Suzanne Chun Oakland said no nonprofit or private entity could coordinate fall prevention in the state with the authority of the state government.\n\nStanley Michaels Jr., 73, an employee with the state Department of Health, is the state\u2019s part-time, volunteer falls prevention coordinator.\n\nMichaels, who took a bad fall himself leading to a hip replacement, gives presentations to seniors and caregivers, recommending seniors get their vision checked annually and review all medication side effects with a doctor or pharmacist; \u201csafety proof\u201d their homes by removing clutter, extension cords, throw rugs or items on the floor; exercise; and carry an electronic monitoring device.\n\nRead more on Watchdog.org.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Taxpayers will spend $81,000 in 2015 on a new government position\u2014\"fall-prevention coordinator,\" who will teach Hawaii\u2019s senior citizens how not to fall.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Taxpayers will spend $81,000 in 2015 on a new government position\u2014\"fall-prevention coordinator,\" who will teach Hawaii\u2019s senior citizens how not to fall.", "title": "Hawaii Taxpayers Will Pay for 'Fall-Prevention Coordinator'", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/140714_HawaiiFall_Watchdog.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-07-04T16:38:27+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1o8q4C5"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Taxpayers will spend $81,000 in 2015 on a new government position\u2014\"fall-prevention coordinator,\" who will teach Hawaii\u2019s senior citizens how not to fall.", "creator": "@dailysignal", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/140714_HawaiiFall_Watchdog.jpg"}, "title": "Hawaii Taxpayers Will Pay for 'Fall-Prevention Coordinator'", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Economy", "tag": "government waste", "published_time": "2014-07-06T03:01:26+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-07-04T16:38:27+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "hawaii, fall-prevention coordinator, department of health, Suzanne Chun Oakland. government waste, Sam Slom"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca0d4\"", "article_summary": "Stanley Michaels Jr., 73, an employee with the state Department of Health, is the state\u2019s part-time, volunteer falls prevention coordinator.\nTaxpayers will spend $81,000 in 2015 on a new government position\u2014\u201dfall-prevention coordinator,\u201d who will teach Hawaii\u2019s senior citizens, well, how not to fall.\nWhat\u2019s more, Hawaii\u2019s population of people 65 and older is expected to reach 20 percent of the population by 2030.\nThe Department of Health already has a volunteer coordinator but believes the full-time position will help Hawaii\u2019s seniors remain healthy, productive and active and\u2014ultimately\u2014 ave taxpayers money.\nThese days, however, Hawaii seems compelled to pay someone to offer such ubiquitous and common-sense advice."}
