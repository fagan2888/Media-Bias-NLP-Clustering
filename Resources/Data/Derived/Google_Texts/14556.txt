BIRMINGHAM, Alabama – The Affordable Care Act will be a boon for outsourcing companies, especially those that handle payroll for small and medium-sized businesses, Trefis.com reports on Forbes magazine's website.

Under the terms of the employer mandate businesses with 50 to 99 full-time equivalent employees will have to provide health insurance beginning in January of 2016.

Outsourcing companies such as Automatic Data Processing LLC (Nasdaq: ADP) and Paychex Inc. (Nasdaq: PAYX) – both of which have new products related to the mandate - will see their business grow as clients seek help in calculating the size of their work force in order to avoid penalties, Trefis analysts write in a post on Forbes' Great Speculations blog.

"We believe that businesses will very soon start purchasing these solutions in order to avoid being penalized due to non-compliance with the ACA," the blog, which focuses on actionable investment advice, reports.
