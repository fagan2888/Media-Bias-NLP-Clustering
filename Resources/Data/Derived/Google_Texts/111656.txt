Normally, I am not really one to listen to Alex Jones. You know, because he’s crazy and all. However, I am often accused of being “biased”– which is, of course, a very unusual thing for a blogger or opinion columnist to be– so I figure it’s fair to let the right explain, in their own special way, just how they feel about the Affordable Care Act.

OH, ok. Now I see the logic! It all makes sense now!
