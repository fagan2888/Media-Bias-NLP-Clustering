Family Research Council president and hate group leader Tony Perkins is weighing in on a new California policy allowing transgender prisoners to obtain gender reassignment surgery, which he describes as “rewarding people who don’t just break the state’s laws, but nature’s, too.”

Perkins claimed on his “Washington Watch” radio program Thursday the number of incarcerated transgender people is “about to be more, once they know that they can get free surgery.”

“With a price tag of anywhere from $50,000 to $100,000 for these reassignment surgeries,” he explained, “I think there’s no shortage of people that may want to sign up [to go to prison].”

Right Wing Watch has the audio:

Under the policy that took effect last week, prison mental health professionals would refer inmates for the surgery.

To qualify, prisoners must be diagnosed with what is formally known as gender dysphoria; lived as their identified gender for at least 12 months; and expressed a desire for sex-reassignment surgery for at least two years.

The announcement came after California became the first state to agree to pay for surgery for one inmate and refused to provide the procedure to another inmate who has since been paroled.
