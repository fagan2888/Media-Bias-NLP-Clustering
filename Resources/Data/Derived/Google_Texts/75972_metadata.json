This year\u2019s annual review recommended culling them from the collection \u201cbecause they were not a good use of limited resources.\u201d\n\nHe said the vehicles need extensive conservation and restoration because of issues with the paint and several structural parts that were missing or need repair. It\u2019s possible, he said, however, that they could be made drivable again. Fortunately, he said, the museum has other vehicles that are better representations of the period for exhibit.\n\nDr. Mark Smucker, a Studebaker enthusiast who lives in Middlebury, said the \u201854 Conestoga wagon and \u201857 Packard Clipper represent different parts of Studebaker history. The Conestoga made its mark by having a roof that could slide off the back to make room for items as large as a refrigerator.\n\n\u201cYou would be able to take out six passengers in front seats and another two to three on (third-row) seats in back,\u201d he said. \u201cThe use of that was for moms hauling around their kids and groceries, similar to a hatchback. It was like a car and a pickup in one vehicle.\u201d\n\nAccording to Smucker, after the Great Depression, the Packard company had to merge with Studebaker, otherwise it would have been forced out of business by larger automobile manufacturers.\n\n\u201cThe least expensive way to make a Packard (after the merger) was to take a car that was on the Studebaker line and modify it to have some more Packard-looking features and label it as a Packard,\u201d Smucker said. \u201cThose cars were quite different from Packard. They had a variety of engines. They had a few Packard engines but they lost those manufacturing plants, so they started using Studebaker engines.\n\n\u201c1957 and 1958 Packards are essentially glorified Studebakers.\u201d\n\nThe Studebaker museum follows procedures for removal set by the American Alliance of Museums.\n\nJoe Klem, director of communications for AAM, said \u201cmany museum collections contain objects that may no longer have relevance to the museum\u2019s mission.\u201d\n\nKlem said, \u201cAll too often, they remain in the collection, using up space and institutional resources\u201d\n\n\u201cIn no event,\u201d he added, \u201cshould the potential monetary value of an object be considered as part of the criteria for determining whether or not\u201d a piece should be kept or taken out of a collection.\n\nBeckman said the two cars being removed from the Studebaker museum will likely be listed for Internet auction and \u201cthe funds from those stay with the collection.\u201d\n\nAlthough these cars were donated, the museum often displays vehicles that are loaned or purchased using museum funds.\n\nAccording to the National Automobile Dealers Association\u2019s website, a 1958 Packard Clipper had an original Manufacturer Suggested Retail Price of $3,212, while a 1956 Conestoga station wagon had an MSRP of $2,448. Beckman would not speculate on how much the museum\u2019s auction of its two cars is expected to bring in.\n\nSmucker said cars from the 1950s can sell for $20,000 to $30,000 if they are in great condition. For lower end Studebakers that have missing parts or other problems, he said the price can be as little as $50 to $1,500.\n\nncaratas@sbtinfo.com\n\nBuy a classic\n\nTwo cars from Studebaker National Museum will be listed for sale on eBay sometime next week.
