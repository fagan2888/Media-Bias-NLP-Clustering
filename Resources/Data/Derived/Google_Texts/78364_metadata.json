The Republican governor signed off on expanding Medicaid in the state, but steadfastly opposed the establishment of a state-run marketplace, leaving New Jersey's insurance exchange in the hands of the feds.\n\nDespite Christie's hands-off approach, the rate of those uninsured in NJ has been cut in half and premium costs are down. But it's not all good news. There's a massive backlog of Medicaid applicants, since the state's Medicaid expansion wasn't accompanied by an increase in resources to process those applicants. Plus, insurers are passing more of the cost of care onto consumers, leading to mounting debt among the chronically ill and those with serious conditions.\n\nAnd Latino enrollment continues to lag behind the rest of the general population. Latinos make up 33 percent of the state's uninsured, yet represented just 7 percent of those who signed up last year.\n\nThe federal government says the application process will be streamlined in 2015, which may lead to increased enrollment in New Jersey and elsewhere.\n\nBut New Jersey Public Radio reporter Kai Wright said a new court case challenging the law may make the government's work moot.\n\n\"The big unknown is the Supreme Court, [which] will decide whether or nor the tax credits are legal,\" said Wright. \"Eight out of 10 people who signed up have tax credits. If they throw that part of it out, they're basically throwing out the law....It certainly has insurers scared.\"\n\nThis series is produced with support from The Healthcare Foundation of New Jersey.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Kai Wright looks back on the law's successes and shortcomings one year in, and looks ahead to what will change ...", "og": {"site_name": "WNYC", "description": "Kai Wright looks back on the law's successes and shortcomings one year in, and looks ahead to what will change as the country gears up for 2015's open enrollment period.", "title": "What We've Learned About Obamacare in NJ", "url": "http://www.wnyc.org/story/obamacare-nj-what-have-we-learned-and-what-will-change-2015/?utm_source=sharedUrl&utm_medium=metatag&utm_campaign=sharedUrl", "image": "https://media2.wnyc.org/i/1200/627/c/80/1/20140409_WNYC_HealthNewark-299.jpg", "video": {"width": 200, "identifier": "http://www.wnyc.org/media/audioplayer/facebook_embed.swf?file=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.wnyc.org%2Faudio%2Fxspf%2F413528%2F&autostart=true", "type": "application/x-shockwave-flash", "height": 29}, "type": "video.episode"}, "is_article": "True", "twitter": {"app": {"id": {"iphone": 470219771, "googleplay": "org.wnyc.android"}}, "image": "https://media2.wnyc.org/i/1200/627/c/80/1/20140409_WNYC_HealthNewark-299.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@WNYC"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=470219771", "fb": {"app_id": 151261804904925}, "keywords": "npr, new york, WNYC, arts, culture, news, public, radio", "overhaul/config/environment": "%7B%22wnycURL%22%3A%20%22http%3A//www.wnyc.org%22%2C%20%22googleAPIv3Key%22%3A%20%22AIzaSyCDbxxvbl0Zj6af28IfWjJ-S0SKxwDXnkc%22%2C%20%22renderGoogleAds%22%3A%20true%2C%20%22modulePrefix%22%3A%20%22overhaul%22%2C%20%22ember-metrics%22%3A%20%7B%22includeAdapters%22%3A%20%5B%22google-analytics%22%2C%20%22data-warehouse%22%5D%7D%2C%20%22something%22%3A%20%22test%22%2C%20%22metricsAdapters%22%3A%20%5B%5D%2C%20%22contentSecurityPolicy%22%3A%20%7B%22script-src%22%3A%20%22%27self%27%20%27unsafe-inline%27%20%27unsafe-eval%27%20data%3A%20%2A%22%2C%20%22img-src%22%3A%20%22%27self%27%20data%3A%20%2A%22%2C%20%22frame-src%22%3A%20%22%27self%27%20%2A%22%2C%20%22style-src%22%3A%20%22%27self%27%20%27unsafe-inline%27%20%2A.wnyc.net%3A%2A%20%2A.wnyc.org%20cloud.typography.com%20fonts.googleapis.com%20www.google.com%20platform.twitter.com%22%2C%20%22connect-src%22%3A%20%22%27self%27%20%2A.wnyc.net%3A%2A%20ws%3A//%2A.wnyc.net%3A%2A%22%2C%20%22object-src%22%3A%20%22%27self%27%20%2A.wnyc.net%3A%2A%20%2A.wnyc.org%20%2A.moatads.com%20%2A.googlesyndication.com%22%2C%20%22font-src%22%3A%20%22%27self%27%20data%3A%20fonts.gstatic.com%22%7D%2C%20%22featureFlags%22%3A%20%7B%22embedded-components%22%3A%20false%2C%20%22django-page-routing%22%3A%20true%2C%20%22persistent-player%22%3A%20false%7D%2C%20%22ember-cli-mirage%22%3A%20%7B%22usingProxy%22%3A%20true%2C%20%22useDefaultPassthroughs%22%3A%20true%7D%2C%20%22EmberENV%22%3A%20%7B%22FEATURES%22%3A%20%7B%7D%7D%2C%20%22locationType%22%3A%20%22auto%22%2C%20%22APP%22%3A%20%7B%22version%22%3A%20%220.0.0%2B%22%2C%20%22name%22%3A%20%22overhaul%22%7D%2C%20%22sentry%22%3A%20%7B%22development%22%3A%20false%2C%20%22whitelistUrls%22%3A%20%5B%7B%7D%2C%20%7B%7D%2C%20%7B%7D%5D%2C%20%22includePaths%22%3A%20%5Bnull%2C%20%7B%7D%2C%20%7B%7D%2C%20%7B%7D%5D%2C%20%22dsn%22%3A%20%22https%3A//62cc19caee0944219c038a6287eff1c5%40sentry.wnyc.org/3%22%2C%20%22debug%22%3A%20false%2C%20%22ravenOptions%22%3A%20%7B%22ignoreUrls%22%3A%20%5B%7B%7D%2C%20%7B%7D%2C%20%7B%7D%5D%2C%20%22ignoreErrors%22%3A%20%5B%22adsafeprotected%22%5D%7D%7D%2C%20%22baseURL%22%3A%20%22/%22%2C%20%22googleAnalyticsKey%22%3A%20%22UA-283599-12%22%2C%20%22wnycEtagAPI%22%3A%20%22https%3A//www.wnyc.org/api/v1/browser_id/%22%2C%20%22environment%22%3A%20%22production%22%2C%20%22exportApplicationGlobal%22%3A%20false%2C%20%22wnycAccountRoot%22%3A%20%22https%3A//account.wnyc.org%22%2C%20%22wnycStaticURL%22%3A%20%22//media.wnyc.org/static/%22%2C%20%22wnycAPI%22%3A%20%22//api.wnyc.org%22%7D", "has_audio": "True", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "revision": "38c95afd1495bd1d3d3aac5bf07d20e1"}, "article_summary": "There's a massive backlog of Medicaid applicants, since the state's Medicaid expansion wasn't accompanied by an increase in resources to process those applicants.\nLatinos make up 33 percent of the state's uninsured, yet represented just 7 percent of those who signed up last year.\nDespite Christie's hands-off approach, the rate of those uninsured in NJ has been cut in half and premium costs are down.\n\"The big unknown is the Supreme Court, [which] will decide whether or nor the tax credits are legal,\" said Wright.\nThe federal government says the application process will be streamlined in 2015, which may lead to increased enrollment in New Jersey and elsewhere."}
