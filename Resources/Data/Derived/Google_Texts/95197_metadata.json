The ballot contained an incomplete listing of the candidates for the office of Council member. Once our office received notice of the error we immediately worked to advise voters and bring awareness to the situation and send voters a replacement ballot.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, a mistake was made by the print vendor when reprinting and resending the replacement ballot, and the original incorrect ballot was mailed,\u201d the statement continued. \u201cWe are working closely with the City of Peoria to resolve this as quickly as possible and determine what course of action to take next.\u201d\n\nBut Mr. Krieger isn\u2019t satisfied with that response. He wants the county \u201cto start over and have a special election where Dr. Krieger\u2019s name has a fair chance of being first on the ballot,\u201d said his attorney Kory Langhofer, a local CBS affiliate reported.\n\nCounty officials said there isn\u2019t enough time for that, and Mr. Krieger is threatening to sue.\n\n\u201cOne way or the other, the voters are going to be informed about what happens in government and what can happen with elections that is not according to the law and that is not proper,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Krieger said he\u2019ll wait to see the outcome of the Aug. 26 election before he takes any action.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Maricopa County Elections Office in Arizona has for the second time mailed out ballots that leave off a legitimate candidate's name, and now he's threatening to sue.", "Author": "Jessica Chasmar", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "The Maricopa County Elections Office in Arizona has for the second time mailed out ballots that leave off a legitimate candidate\u2019s name, and now he\u2019s threatening to sue.", "title": "Valid candidate left off ballot twice in Arizona election", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/aug/7/valid-candidate-left-ballot-twice-az-election/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/08/07/ken-krieger.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/08/07/ken-krieger.jpg", "title": "Valid candidate left off ballot twice in Arizona election", "description": "The Maricopa County Elections Office in Arizona has for the second time mailed out ballots that leave off a legitimate candidate's name, and now he's threatening to sue.", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0f6d\"", "article_summary": "The elections office said in a statement: \u201cThe Primary Election ballot originally sent to voters in the City of Peoria, Mesquite district had an error.\nThe Maricopa County Elections Office in Arizona has for the second time mailed out ballots that leave off a legitimate candidate\u2019s name, and now he\u2019s threatening to sue.\n\u201cUnfortunately, a mistake was made by the print vendor when reprinting and resending the replacement ballot, and the original incorrect ballot was mailed,\u201d the statement continued.\nMr. Krieger said he\u2019ll wait to see the outcome of the Aug. 26 election before he takes any action.\nOnce our office received notice of the error we immediately worked to advise voters and bring awareness to the situation and send voters a replacement ballot."}
