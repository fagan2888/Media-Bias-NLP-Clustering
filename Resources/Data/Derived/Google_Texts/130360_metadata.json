But Thornberry said he is worried that senators may try to amend provisions that have already been hashed out during the first process, complicating its passage.\n\nThornberry said he thinks he is in the \"ballpark\" of enough votes to override the president's veto, which he said would be the easier path forward.\n\n\"It would be the cleanest, simplest way,\" he said. \"We can't open it back up.\"\n\nThe final version of the bill passed the House last month, 270-156. The bill would need 20 more supporters to override the president's veto.\n\nThornberry said \"most of the Republicans are back who had voted against it,\" and some Democrats will switch their votes to \u2018yes,\u2019 since the president's objection to the bill is fixed.\n\nThornberry said he hoped Congress could return to a bipartisan approach in passing a defense policy bill, which has passed annually for 53 consecutive years with bipartisan support.\n\n\"We're going to be ready with both options,\" he added, however.\n\n\"It's really going to be a leadership call on which approach to take,\" he said.\n\n-- Updated 5:17 p.m.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Rep.
