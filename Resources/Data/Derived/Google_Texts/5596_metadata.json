Avoiding the dentist, however, can result in a number of issues such as cavities or even the dreaded root canal. But a new pain-free option might be just around the corner.\n\nAccording to new research from King's College London, scientists there are trying to implement a new tooth-rebuilding technique. This will allow and encourage teeth to repair themselves instead of just filling the decay. The technique is called Electrically Accelerated and Enhanced Remineralisation (EAER), which helps to increase the movement of calcium and phosphate minerals into a decayed tooth.\n\n\u201cBy accelerating the natural process by which calcium and phosphate minerals re-enter the tooth to repair a defect, the device boosts the tooth\u2019s natural repair process,\u201d Kings College London said in a news release, \u201cDentistry has been trying to harness this process for the last few decades, but the King\u2019s breakthrough means the method could soon be in use at the dentist\u2019s chair.\u201d\n\nThe company, called Reminova Ltd, is the maker of this two-step process, and it could be available within the next three years. Reminova is a subsidiary of Kings College London. Here\u2019s how it works: The machine repairs the damaged part of the outer layer of the enamel. Then, there is a tiny electric current that helps to accelerate the minerals into the tooth \u2014 helping to repair the decay. The tooth is then reminerlized, which means that minerals are returned to the molecular structure of the decayed tooth. The dentist then uses electric currents to check the nerve of the tooth.\n\n\u201cThe way we treat teeth today is not ideal \u2014 when we repair a tooth by putting in a filling, that tooth enters a cycle of drilling and re-filling as, ultimately, each \u2018repair\u2019 fails,\u201d said Professor Nigel Pitts from the Dental Institute at King\u2019s College London in a statement.\n\nAccording to the Centers For Disease Control and Prevention, one in every five Americans has untreated cavities.\n\n\"Untreated tooth decay is prevalent in the U.S.,\" said report co-author Dr. Bruce Dye, an epidemiologist at the CDC's National Center for Health Statistics. \"It appears that we haven't been able to make any significant strides during the last decade to reduce untreated cavities.\u201d This new treatment could potentially prevent tooth decay from progressing into worse dental issues and could be used for other dental needs. \u201cNot only is our device kinder to the patient and better for their teeth, but it\u2019s expected to be at least as cost-effective as current dental treatments.\"", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "tooth decay, cavity fillings", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "A new technique could reduce the need for conventional cavity fillings, as well as decrease the cost of these procedures.", "title": "New Dental Technique Could Mean No More Fillings", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/new-tooth-decay-treatment-could-accelerate-calcium-and-mineral-growth-eliiminating-need-cavity", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/16/shutterstock160357181.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A new technique could reduce the need for conventional cavity fillings, as well as decrease the cost of these procedures.", "title": "New Dental Technique Could Mean No More Fillings", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/new-tooth-decay-treatment-could-accelerate-calcium-and-mineral-growth-eliiminating-need-cavity", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/16/shutterstock160357181.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/16/shutterstock160357181.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Healthy Living", "published_time": "2014-06-16T17:35:31-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-06-16T17:35:29-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "A new technique could reduce the need for conventional cavity fillings, as well as decrease the cost of these procedures."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc97e0\"", "article_summary": "According to new research from King's College London, scientists there are trying to implement a new tooth-rebuilding technique.\n\"Untreated tooth decay is prevalent in the U.S.,\" said report co-author Dr. Bruce Dye, an epidemiologist at the CDC's National Center for Health Statistics.\nReminova is a subsidiary of Kings College London.\nThen, there is a tiny electric current that helps to accelerate the minerals into the tooth \u2014 helping to repair the decay.\nA new technique could reduce the need for conventional cavity fillings, as well as decrease the cost of these procedures."}
