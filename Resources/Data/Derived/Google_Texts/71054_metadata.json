Mr.Lujan, CC BY-ND 2.0\n\nBeginning Oct. 1, the 31 public colleges and universities that make up the Georgia University System will go tobacco-free as part of a system-wide mandate that prohibits their use on campus.\n\nThe move comes as a growing number of colleges around the country enact total tobacco bans or partial smoking bans. (Georgia students will still face a penalty for chewing tobacco and e-cigarettes.) According to the lobbying group Americans for Nonsmokers\u2019 Rights, by October 2010 there were 450 colleges nationwide who participated in some form. By Wednesday, the number will have more than tripled.\n\n\u201cIt goes back to health and productivity,\u201d Marion Fedrick, the university system\u2019s vice chancellor of human resources, told The New York Times. \u201cWe\u2019re not at all saying that they can\u2019t smoke. They just can\u2019t smoke on our campuses.\u201d\n\nOf course, a supreme hurdle in any outright ban is enforcement. When a governing body tells a group of people they must quit a habit (even if it\u2019s just a NIMBY-related one), there is a tension between how the group of people see the rule and how much demand there is to keep the habit alive. Things get especially complicated when that habit is easily extinguished on a nearby wall or on the sole of a sneaker.\n\nOther universities have already modeled success. Framingham State University, located just west of Boston, has seen dips in on-campus smoking rates ever since administrators enacted their ban in 2013. \u201cIs our campus 100 percent smoke-free?\u201d said FSU Dean Melinda K. Stoops, to The Times. \u201cNo. You\u2019ll still find someone violating the policy. Is it dramatically different? Yes.\u201d\n\nTobacco use as a whole is coming down in the United States. In the 1960s, rates flew as high as 40 percent. By the most recent estimates, smoking has quieted to just above 18 percent. It still remains the leading cause of death, however, and few intervention strategies have succeeded. Splashing frightening and grotesque images on cigarette packs only seems to enhance the danger, especially for a smoking population that already fancies themselves risk-takers.\n\nExperts argue the most effective measures aren\u2019t ones that involve an \u201cimmediate jump-in,\u201d as Tad Spencer, the director of tobacco prevention initiatives for Naspa, a national student affairs organization, put it. The transition is intended to be one of education and gradual phasing out. At the University of Georgia, students already know they may not smoke within 35 feet of an academic building or bus stop.\n\nAs for enforcement, some students remained skeptical the ban \u2014 or \u201cprohibition,\u201d as one Georgia administrator put it, to make the move seem less harsh \u2014 will yield meaningful change. Under the gun, when students aren\u2019t unwinding with video games, yoga, or prescription drugs, they\u2019re probably smoking.\n\n\u201cHypothetically, yes, it\u2019d be nice to have a tobacco-free world,\u201d said Beni Kozen, a junior, to The Times. \u201cBut sometimes you just need a study break and a stress-relief break.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "georgia, colleges, ban, tobacco, effort, boost, awareness, education", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "All 31 colleges and universities in the Georgia University System will be putting an end to their current 35-foot rule.", "title": "Georgia Colleges Will Soon Be Banning All Tobacco Products", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/georgia-colleges-ban-tobacco-effort-boost-awareness-education-305570", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/09/29/smoking.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "All 31 colleges and universities in the Georgia University System will be putting an end to their current 35-foot rule.", "title": "Georgia Colleges Will Soon Be Banning All Tobacco Products", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/georgia-colleges-ban-tobacco-effort-boost-awareness-education-305570", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/09/29/smoking.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/09/29/smoking.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2014-09-29T17:12:12-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-09-29T17:12:11-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "All 31 colleges and universities in the Georgia University System will be putting an end to their current 35-foot rule."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf0c6\"", "article_summary": "All 31 colleges and universities in the Georgia University System will be putting an end to their current 35-foot rule.\n(Georgia students will still face a penalty for chewing tobacco and e-cigarettes.)\nThe move comes as a growing number of colleges around the country enact total tobacco bans or partial smoking bans.\nAt the University of Georgia, students already know they may not smoke within 35 feet of an academic building or bus stop.\nMr.Lujan, CC BY-ND 2.0Beginning Oct. 1, the 31 public colleges and universities that make up the Georgia University System will go tobacco-free as part of a system-wide mandate that prohibits their use on campus."}
