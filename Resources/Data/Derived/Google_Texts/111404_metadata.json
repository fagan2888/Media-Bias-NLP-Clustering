The conference call hearing ended with the media, including The Spectator, being asked to hang up. The two lawyers and Strathdee resumed the hearing in private.\n\nVisintini and Kinahan could not be immediately reached for comment Friday.\n\nMellor pleaded guilty last month to a slew of police act misconduct charges involving off-duty sex, sexting and sending a woman a three-second video of himself masturbating. His targets were the women he came into professional contact with.\n\nThey included witnesses, victims, a victim's mother and even agency staff. The probe against Mellor began in 2012 after a 19-year-old former sex worker, who was a witness in a human trafficking case, accused him of having an inappropriate sexual relationship with her.\n\nMellor has been suspended from duty since he was charged in December 2012. He faced 13 charges \u2014 and has pleaded guilty to nine. Two counts of corrupt practice and breach of duty were withdrawn by the prosecutor and two counts were \"adjourned sine die,\" meaning they are suspended, but can be reactivated in the future.\n\nMellor's previous lawyer, Clewley, said last month Mellor hopes to keep his job with Hamilton police.\n\nMellor did not participate in Friday's conference call. Next is an in-person appearance for Mellor April 24 at 8 a.m., at the Hamilton Police Central Station.\n\nHearing dates have been set for July 14 and 15 at the Hamilton Police Central Station.", "article_metadata": {"RATING": "GENERAL", "DESCRIPTION": "New lawyer yet to be confirmed.", "COPYRIGHT": "\u00a9 Copyright 2016 Metroland Media Group Ltd.
