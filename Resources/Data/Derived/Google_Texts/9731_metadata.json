Dent (R-Lehigh), Pitts (R-Chester), Fitzpatrick (R-Bucks) and Meehan (R-Delaware).\n\n\u201cGoing forward we\u2019re going to make Tea Party loyalty a central part of our messaging and paid ad/polling/grassroots activity holding Republicans accountable for putting a handful of ideological extremists and exploitive billionaires ahead of America\u2019s economy and middle class,\u201d Lauren Weiner, Americans United for Change spokeswoman said. \u201cWhether it\u2019s standing in the way of restoring UI, raising the minimum wage, or comprehensive immigration reform.\u201d\n\nThe group uses a Tea Party Scorecard, a play on the use of scoring mechanisms by ultra-conservative organizations, to measure how often members of Congress vote with the Tea Party. They set their own definition of Tea Party votes, as well. Members were given points for each of the following criterium:\n\nVotes associated with repealing, dismantling or delaying the Affordable Care and Patient Protection Act, more commonly known as Obamacare or health care reform\n\nVotes associated with the Tea Party-provoked government shutdown in the fall of 2013 \u2013 most of which could also reasonably be seen as votes defunding, dismantling or delaying the Affordable Care Act\n\nEvery vote scored by either or both of the major advocacy organizations associated with the Tea Party \u2013 Americans for Prosperity and Freedomworks\n\nThey also claim that the districts that they target are swing elections that will be close in 2014. Rep. Joe Pitts was the most \u201cTea Stained\u201d according to the group, with a score of 88 percent. He is followed closely by Rep. Mike Fitzpatrick (73 percent), Rep. Pat Meehan (71 percent) and Rep. Charlie Dent (69 percent).\n\nSo far, Pitts, Dent and Meehan don\u2019t have opponents. Fitzpatrick will face the winner of a two-way primary between Kevin Strouse and Shaughnessy Naughton.\n\nThe National Republican Campaign Committee didn\u2019t seem concerned with the new attacks.\n\n\u201cThe first thing that came to mind when learning about this was that April Fools\u2019 Day came two months early. Congressman Dent, Fitzpatrick, Meehan and Pitts are four representatives who embody what it means to put their districts and constituents before any particular political philosophy,\u201d NRCC Spokesman Ian Prior said. \u201cOn the other hand, Americans United for Change is nothing more than an extreme leftist Super PAC that is trying to deceive voters by wasting its money on deceptive propaganda that has no legitimate basis whatsoever.\u201d\n\nThe Americans United for Change list contrasts sharply with a study put out by Cook Political Report last November. Cook Political Report studied members of Congress who voted against major bipartisan bills as a measure of \u201cRepublican Resistance.\u201d In Pennsylvania, they put Pitts, Scott Perry (R-York) and Keith Rothfus (R-Allegheny) on their list.\n\nJanuary 22nd, 2014 | Posted in Congress, Front Page Stories, Top Stories | 8 Comments", "article_metadata": {"description": "Liberal organization scores \u201cTea Party\u201d votes from Reps.
