A man is dead after a three-vehicle crash in Federal Heights Sunday night, officials said.

Around 6:32 p.m., Colorado State Patrol responded to a three-vehicle crash at 84th Avenue and Pecos Street, said state patrol Cpl. Heather Cobler.

A Ford Taurus was westbound on 84th Avenue at Pecos Street, Cobler said, when it made a left turn in front of an eastbound Kia Optima. The Optima “continued on to strike the Ford truck,” Cobler said.

The man driving the Taurus was transported to Denver Health Medical Center with serious injuries, Cobler said.

An adult male passenger in the Taurus was taken to St. Anthony’s Hospital where he died, Cobler said.

The Kia driver did not suffer injuries, but the adult female passenger was taken to Denver Health Medical Center with serious injuries, Cobler said.

The Ford truck driver did not suffer injuries.

Cobler said northbound lanes of Pecos Street are closed and should open within the hour.
