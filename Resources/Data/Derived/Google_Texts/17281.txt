Washington Nationals second baseman Asdrubal Cabrera and manager Matt Williams were ejected in the top of the 10th inning of Saturday’s Game 2 of the National League Division Series.

Cabrera had words for plate umpire Vic Carapazza after disagreeing with a called strike two, circling the plate in a display that likely would have gotten him tossed immediately in a regular-season game. When Carapazza then rung him up on strike three, Cabrera slammed down his bat and helmet and got a quick hook from the umpire.

That brought Williams out of the dugout to argue and he, too, was tossed despite a far less demonstrative discussion.

“[Cabrera‘s] actions warranted ejection, based on his disagreement with the pitches,” crew chief Mike Winters, who was working at third base, told a pool reporter.

“In this case, he slammed the bat to the ground. That’s going to be gone. Even in a game of this magnitude, he’s got to have enough self-control to not do that. He could’ve said his piece and left and probably stayed in the game,” he said.

Earlier in the game, Bryce Harper had woofed at Carapazza after a called strike but managed to stay in.
