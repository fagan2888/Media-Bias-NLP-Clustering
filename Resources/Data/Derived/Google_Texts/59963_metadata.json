(The death last month of Justice Antonin Scalia left the court with only eight members.)\n\nAll four ruled that religious groups seeking to opt out of the requirement that they pay for the coverage must sign forms and provide information that would shift the cost to insurance companies and the government. A tie vote would not set a national precedent, and religious groups in different parts of the country would have conflicting obligations for what they must do if they object to covering contraception.\n\nOther appeals courts have agreed that the accommodation offered to religious groups is lawful. But the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which hears cases from federal courts in Arkansas, Iowa, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota and South Dakota, ruled that it violated the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993, which says that government requirements placing a substantial burden on religious practices are subject to an exceptionally demanding standard of judicial scrutiny.\n\nWednesday\u2019s case grew out of a regulation requiring many employers to provide the coverage for contraception under the Affordable Care Act. Religious institutions such as schools and churches have said that forcing them to comply with that violates the religious-freedom law. They also objected to an alternative offered by the government that would allow them to opt out of the requirement by completing a form.\n\nThe court\u2019s four more liberal members appeared ready to endorse that alternative.\n\n\u201cThere has to be an accommodation,\u201d Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s what the government tried to do.\u201d\n\nBut it appeared unlikely the liberal justices would be able to attract the crucial vote of Justice Anthony Kennedy, who repeatedly questioned whether the accommodation was making the groups \u201ccomplicit in the moral wrong\u201d by hijacking their insurance plans.\n\nThough Justice Clarence Thomas asked no questions, there was little doubt about where the three more conservative justices stood. Justice Samuel Alito, citing arguments in supporting briefs, said the government\u2019s approach represented \u201can unprecedented threat to religious liberty in this country.\u201d\n\nMuch of the argument concerned whether the government could provide free contraception coverage without using the groups\u2019 insurance plans. Alito suggested, for instance, that the government could use the insurance exchanges created under the Affordable Care Act. The burden on women would be minimal, Alito said. \u201cSo she\u2019ll have two insurance cards instead of one,\u201d he said.\n\nBut Justice Sonia Sotomayor said it was important to make obtaining coverage easy. \u201cWhen contraceptives are provided to women in a seamless way,\u201d she said, \u201cthe number of unintended pregnancies dramatically falls, as does the number of abortions.\u201d\n\nSolicitor General Donald Verrilli, representing the Obama administration, said Alito\u2019s alternatives would be cumbersome and would not \u201ccome anywhere close to being equally effective in ensuring that women get this coverage.\u201d\n\nChief Justice John Roberts seemed to view that answer as a major concession. \u201cYour compelling interest is not that women obtain the contraceptive services,\u201d the chief justice said. \u201cYour compelling interest is that women obtain the contraceptive services through the insurance plan or the third-party administrator hired by\u201d the religious groups.\n\n\u201cThe petitioner has used the phrase \u2018hijacking,\u2019 and it seems to me that that\u2019s an accurate description of what the government wants to do,\u201d Roberts said.\n\nJustice Stephen Breyer said a cumbersome process involving two insurers would dissuade women from obtaining contraception. He added: \u201cThis is not hijacking because there is a federal regulation that says the infrastructure of the insurers\u2019 contraceptive-related plan belongs to the insurer, not to the person who buys the insurance.\u201d\n\nVerrilli agreed, saying the alternatives would \u201cresult in significantly less use of medically necessary services.\u201d\n\nThe answer did not seem to satisfy Kennedy. \u201cThat\u2019s why it\u2019s necessary to hijack the plans,\u201d he said caustically. \u201cThe church plans here, religious organization plans here, are, in effect, subsidizing the conduct that they deemed immoral,\u201d Kennedy said.\n\nPaul Clement, a lawyer for the order of nuns the Little Sisters of the Poor and other challengers, said his clients should be entitled to the outright exemption offered to houses of worship such as churches, temples and mosques. Houses of worship do not have to file any paperwork if they choose not to provide contraception coverage.\n\nHe added that many other employers were also effectively exempt from the contraception requirement. Small employers need not offer health coverage, and some insurance plans that had not previously included contraception coverage are grandfathered, so long as they do not make substantial changes to the plans.\n\nRoberts said the argument had force. \u201cIf you have a lot of exemptions,\u201d he said, \u201cit undermines your argument that this is such a compelling interest.\u201d\n\nBreyer questioned Noel Francisco, a lawyer for a second group of challengers, describing a federal program filled with haphazard exemptions and asking whether it would violate the religious-freedom law.\n\nFrancisco said sure.\n\n\u201cOK,\u201d Breyer said. \u201cI\u2019ve just described to you the United States tax code.\u201d\n\nThe more liberal justices said a pluralistic society required compromise. \u201cSometimes when a religious person who\u2019s not a hermit or a monk is a member of society, he does have to accept all kinds of things that are just terrible for him,\u201d Breyer said. \u201cThink of the Quakers who object to Vietnam. \u2026 Think of the people who object to shoveling the snow in front of the walk that will lead to the abortion clinic.\u201d\n\nThe more conservative justices were more apt to credit the challengers\u2019 objections. \u201cYou\u2019re saying,\u201d Kennedy told Verrilli, \u201c \u2018Don\u2019t worry, religions, you\u2019re not complicit.\u2019 \u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "A 4-4 tie appeared to be a real possibility, which would automatically affirm the four appeals-court decisions under review.", "og": {"site_name": "The Seattle Times", "description": "A 4-4 tie appeared to be a real possibility, which would automatically affirm the four appeals-court decisions under review.", "title": "Justices seem split in case on Affordable Care Act\u2019s birth-control mandate", "url": "http://www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/justices-seem-split-in-case-on-affordable-care-acts-birth-control-mandate/", "image": {"width": 1560, "identifier": "http://static.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/95d747d8-f149-11e5-97c9-1641d1868cca-1560x1065.jpg", "height": 1065}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@seattletimes", "description": "A 4-4 tie appeared to be a real possibility, which would automatically affirm the four appeals-court decisions under review.", "card": "http://static.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/95d747d8-f149-11e5-97c9-1641d1868cca-780x532.jpg", "title": "Justices seem split in case on Affordable Care Act\u2019s birth-control mandate"}, "robots": "noarchive", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=329502124", "fb": {"admins": 2737159, "app_id": 1522735777957334, "pages": 38472826214}, "msvalidate.01": "29FBBD36D14799A9FDE7843BF1E1CDD7", "article": {"section": "Nation & World", "published_time": "2016-03-23 18:31:24", "modified_time": "2016-03-23 18:31:24"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Nation & World, Health, Nation, Nation & World Politics"}, "article_summary": "Houses of worship do not have to file any paperwork if they choose not to provide contraception coverage.\nWednesday\u2019s case grew out of a regulation requiring many employers to provide the coverage for contraception under the Affordable Care Act.\nOther appeals courts have agreed that the accommodation offered to religious groups is lawful.\n\u201cThe church plans here, religious organization plans here, are, in effect, subsidizing the conduct that they deemed immoral,\u201d Kennedy said.\n\u201cYour compelling interest is that women obtain the contraceptive services through the insurance plan or the third-party administrator hired by\u201d the religious groups."}
