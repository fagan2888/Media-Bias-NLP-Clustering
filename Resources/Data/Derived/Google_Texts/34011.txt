A spill during a race at Monmouth Park has left a jockey with fractured right clavicle.

The accident occurred one mile into the third race on Friday, a $30,000 steeplechase event.

Jockey Bernard Dalton, aboard Run to Class, got tangled with two other horses over the fifth fence of the 2 Â¼-mile turf event. The other horses and their jockeys were reported to be OK.

The 45-year-old Dalton, of Camden, South Carolina, was taken to Monmouth Medical Center for evaluation.

The native of Ireland is considered one of the top steeplechase riders in the country.
