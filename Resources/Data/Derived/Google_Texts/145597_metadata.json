The new review period began February 1, an OCC spokesman said.\n\n\u201cIt will likely prompt further risk rating downgrades in their (banks') SNC portfolios, which may lead to further provisioning,\u201d said Julie Solar, a senior director at Fitch.\n\nAverage bids on U.S. oil and gas loans fell to 76.6 on Feb 2 from 79.1 at year end and a recent peak of 92.8 last May, according to Thomson Reuters LPC data. Bids in the overall leveraged loan market are at the lowest levels since November 2011, pressured by the prospect of steep defaults and broad markets volatility.\n\nLeveraged lending and oil and gas commitments were the main source of underwriting weakness for 28% of sampled loans in last year\u2019s SNC review.\n\nThe new SNC review will analyze data up to Sept 30, 2015, but current lower oil prices will factor into regulators\u2019 bank loan analysis, Solar said.\n\nAdditionally, hedging protection for oil and gas companies is due to mature and may not be renewed, their capital markets access is diminishing and their ability to cut capex further may be constrained, Solar and other Fitch analysts said, which will further increase pressure on ailing energy firms' finances.\n\n\u201cCompanies with low ratings and maturities in 2016 and 2017 will need to deal with higher borrowing costs as credit markets tighten, adding to refinancing risk and default pressures,\u201d Moody\u2019s Investors Service said in a January 26 report.\n\nMoody\u2019s expects the U.S. speculative-grade default rate to increase to 4.4% at year-end from 3.2% at the end of 2015, driven by oil and gas and other commodities. The number of defaults hit a six-year high last year.\n\nAfter the SNC's most recent findings were released in November, regulators warned about oil and gas exposure, and some banks increased loan loss reserves in the fourth quarter as the oil price continued to slide.\n\nU.S. oil trades around US$32 per barrel, after falling last month to around US$26 a barrel for the first time since September 2013.\n\nBanks are expected to take a harder line this spring in their semi-annual reviews of borrowing base facilities, which value assets backing reserve-based loans for energy companies.\n\n\u201cGiven where prices are now, we expect that it (the borrowing base redetermination period) is going to be worse than it was in October when oil prices were US$40 - a point where many forecasters are now saying they are unlikely to return for a couple more years,\u201d said Trey Parker, partner and head of credit at Highland Capital.\n\nLenders are already retreating from providing credit. New leveraged loans for oil and gas companies sank 49% to US$49bn last year, the lowest since US$21bn in 2010, according to Thomson Reuters LPC.\n\nPAIN TOLERANCE\n\nWhile credit ratings agencies are forecasting rising debt defaults, the fallout is expected to be less severe for leveraged loans than high-yield bonds, which have three times more energy exposure.\n\n\u201cRegardless of whether or not we see an uptick in the default rate in energy loans, energy credit is only 3.5% to 4% of the overall loan market, so even if you had a 25% default rate in all energy loans, it would only be about a 1% uptick in the overall loan market default rate,\u201d Parker said.\n\n\u201cWe believe the loan and high-yield markets have already priced in a lot of the defaults in the energy space,\u201d he said.\n\nFitch expects problem energy companies to boost U.S. institutional leveraged loan defaults to US$24bn this year from US$16.4bn last year.\n\nThe OCC in December said that it was closely monitoring oil and gas-related exposure as one of the risks that could develop into a systemic problem and one that may already raise concern at individual banks.\n\nWells Fargo has set more money aside to cover bad oil and gas loans, Reuters reported last month. Citigroup also set aside US$250m, but said it would need twice that amount if oil held at US$25 per barrel.\n\n(Editing By Tessa Walsh and Michelle Sierra)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/02/03/US-regulators-expected-classify-more-energy-loans-high-risk", "type": "article", "site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S.", "title": "U.S. regulators expected to classify more energy loans as high risk"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/02/03/US-regulators-expected-classify-more-energy-loans-high-risk", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Fitch expects problem energy companies to boost U.S. institutional leveraged loan defaults to US$24bn this year from US$16.4bn last year.\nBanks are expected to take a harder line this spring in their semi-annual reviews of borrowing base facilities, which value assets backing reserve-based loans for energy companies.\nWells Fargo has set more money aside to cover bad oil and gas loans, Reuters reported last month.\nNew leveraged loans for oil and gas companies sank 49% to US$49bn last year, the lowest since US$21bn in 2010, according to Thomson Reuters LPC.\n\u201cRegardless of whether or not we see an uptick in the default rate in energy loans, energy credit is only 3.5% to 4% of the overall loan market, so even if you had a 25% default rate in all energy loans, it would only be about a 1% uptick in the overall loan market default rate,\u201d Parker said."}
