The Huckabee show was a vision of unfairness and unbalance tonight as it parodied The 12 Days of Christmas carol with The 12 Days Of ObamaCare. Must be seen to be believed.

It's not really clever, just nasty.

If you watch it, try to get to the end where Huckabee sings his Christmas wish (hint: it's about Republicans winning in 2014). Also, check out the woman in the audience singing along to "Five Harry Reids."

Sheesh.
