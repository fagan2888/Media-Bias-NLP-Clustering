The justices weighed in on a handful of cases, including what was supposed to be one of this term\u2019s blockbusters: a dispute pitting religious freedom against mandate to cover contraception under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nBut the eight justices failed to offer a definitive decision, sending the case back down to lower federal courts.\n\nPresident Obama addressed the decision, and speculated there might have been a different outcome if the vacancy left by the late Justice Scalia had been filled. He spoke with BuzzFeed News.\n\nPRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: Women will still continue to be able to get contraception if they are getting health insurance.\n\nAnd we are properly accommodating religious institutions who have objections to contraception. I won\u2019t speculate as to why they punted, but my suspicion is, if we had nine Supreme Court justices, instead of eight, there might have been a different outcome.\n\nHARI SREENIVASAN: We break down the short-handed court and its rulings today with chief Washington correspondent for \u201cThe National Law Journal\u201d and \u201cNewsHour\u201d regular Marcia Coyle.\n\nMarcia, we spoke about this when the justices seemed to ask for more information from everyone, trying to figure out a third way. So here was a decision without really a decision.\n\nMARCIA COYLE, The National Law Journal: Well, actually, that third way was sort of an opening for the court.\n\nRight after oral arguments, when it looked like the court was going to divide 4-4, they issued a special order telling the parties, the government and the nonprofit employers, to brief their own suggested compromise, a compromise offered by the court itself.\n\nWell, when the brief came back, Hari, it really didn\u2019t look like there was a lot of room for compromise there. But there was enough there that the court, in its opinion today, which was an unsigned opinion read by the chief justice from the bench, the court said, look, it looks as though there\u2019s been movement on both sides here. Let\u2019s give the parties the opportunity in the lower courts to develop it before we, as the Supreme Court, would get involved in it.\n\nAnd that\u2019s what they did. They said specifically they wouldn\u2019t decide whether the government\u2019s plan in practice now to accommodate religious objections substantially burdened these employers\u2019 exercise of religion or whether the government had a compelling interest here or was choosing the least restrictive means to achieve that interest, which is the test under the federal Religious Freedom Restoration Act.\n\nSo, they vacated the lower court decisions in the seven cases that they had before them, and then they also had an additional six cases that were awaiting the outcome in today\u2019s decision. They vacated the lower court rulings in those cases, overwhelmingly had been in favor of the government.\n\nAnd, basically, those federal appellate courts will be starting now from scratch to see if there really is an opening for a compromise here.\n\nHARI SREENIVASAN: So, if you\u2019re starting over from scratch, doesn\u2019t that mean that they could come either back to the same conclusion or, if you have got a number of courts, perhaps there will be a disagreement and then this \u2014 the merits of the case come back in front of the Supreme Court?\n\nMARCIA COYLE: Absolutely.\n\nIf either side is unhappy with the result, they can come back to the Supreme Court. In fact, there was a separate concurrence by Justice Sotomayor joined by Justice Ginsburg in which they said, the court is not ruling on the merits here, so if the lower courts end up reaching the same legal results they did before, that\u2019s what happens, and then the next step will follow.\n\nBut they also said that the nonprofit employers\u2019 suggestion that there should be contraceptive-only insurance policies was not workable. Those policies did not exist, according to the government, and would not provide the seamless health insurance coverage that Congress intended under the act.\n\nSo they sort \u2014 those two justices, at least, have drawn a line in terms of what they might accept.\n\nHARI SREENIVASAN: All right, let\u2019s talk of the second case that kind of came out today was, again, another non-decision to kick it down.\n\nSpokeo, this was the online search engine and the type of results someone could get and whether, I guess, they have standing or not to sue for it.\n\nMARCIA COYLE: Right.\n\nSpokeo, as you said, is an Internet search engine. And it had put up online certain information about a man named Tom Robins. And that information was largely incorrect. And he claimed that that injured him in a number of ways, including his job prospects.\n\nHe was looking for a new job at the time. Credit information was wrong about him. So, he sued, saying that Spokeo\u2019s procedural violations under the federal Credit \u2014 Fair Credit Reporting Act harmed him.\n\nHARI SREENIVASAN: Right.\n\nMARCIA COYLE: And the question before the court was basically, can just saying that a violation of that act alone give you the legal right or standing to sue?\n\nAnd the court today sent the case back to the lower federal appellate courts, saying, basically, what you said here is, you only did half the analysis for standing. You found that there was a particularized injury to Mr. Robins, but the other half is, it has to be a concrete injury.\n\nAnd so Spokeo will now get another chance at defending itself. The standard is clear and tightened. On the other hand, the court gave something to Mr. Robins, saying that some injuries aren\u2019t tangible, they can be intangible, and you can use that under this act.\n\nSo, it was probably not a very satisfying decision to either side. And big business had watched this case closely, because it felt that it\u2019s too easy to sue under the Fair Credit Reporting Act, another act, at least three other federal laws involving consumers, and they were hoping for a definitive answer today.\n\nHARI SREENIVASAN: Does this narrow then the scope of which \u2014 what is the sort of threshold where somebody could bring a lawsuit? Is that a win for big business?\n\nMARCIA COYLE: It tightens it up a little bit, but it\u2019s a narrow decision, and I think it\u2019s a narrow decision because the court, again, is striving to find consensus in these cases, since it\u2019s missing a ninth justice.\n\nHARI SREENIVASAN: Let\u2019s talk a bit about this. Are we seeing a pattern of 4-4 decisions here that would be different, as the president said, if there was a fifth justice \u2014 or a ninth justice?\n\nMARCIA COYLE: Well, I think, Hari, we\u2019re seeing more of those decisions without a ninth justice.\n\nClearly, the court is struggling to reach some kind of a consensus and trying to avoid those 4-4 splits. The court has already decided the big union case involving fair share fees by non-union members paid to public employee unions. There, they divided 4-4.\n\nThey divided 4-4 in an Equal Opportunity Act case earlier in the term. And just last week, in a death penalty case, the justices split 4-4 on a request by Alabama to block a lower federal appellate court\u2019s order temporarily delaying the execution of an Alabama death row inmate.\n\nWe are going to have to wait now, I think, Hari, to see how the court resolves the remaining cases. There are still a few very big cases with very difficult issues facing them.\n\nHARI SREENIVASAN: Marcia Coyle, thanks.\n\nMARCIA COYLE: My pleasure, Hari.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Monday saw the evenly divided Supreme Court punt on two major cases, including a religious challenge to the Affordable Care Act\u2019s contraception mandate.
