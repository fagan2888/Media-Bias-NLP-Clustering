That was the thanks I got from those I thought were family, I was thrown under the bus for expressing my 1st amendment rights and speaking the truth and concerns for law enforcement.\u201d\n\nSurf City Mayor Zander Guy called the emergency meeting Tuesday to discuss personnel concerns in the wake of an earlier Facebook post by Mr. Halstead. The police chief abruptly announced his retirement during the meeting.\n\n\u201cI want to thank all of the folks in Surf City for your support,\u201d Mr. Halstead wrote Wednesday, receiving more than 400 shares. \u201cIt was my pleasure to serve you. Thank you to my officers for your dedication, I will miss everyone of you. I would like to apologize to my family for letting you down. I also apologize to those I have offended, that was not my intent. I have served proudly for 35 years without a blemish. I guess to some Surf City Leaders that has no meaning. I guess I will learn to eat beanie wienies for a few months. I love you all.\u201d\n\nIn his controversial post that has since been deleted, Mr. Halstead wrote that the Black Lives Matter movement is \u201cnothing more than an American born terrorist group brought on by the lie of the hands up don\u2019t shoot during the criminal thug Michael Brown incident.\u201d\n\nHe also wrote that he instructed his officers to be vigilant. \u201cIf that means shoot a thug, then do it and answer for it while you are still alive and not dead,\u201d he argued at the time.\n\nMaj.
