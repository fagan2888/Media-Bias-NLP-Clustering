NEW YORK (AP) — New York really is “the naked city.”

Artists in Manhattan painted the bodies of 40 nude models on Saturday, turning the Columbus Circle entrance to Central Park into an outdoor celebration of the human form.

Artist Andy Golub says New York was the only city in the country that would allow his inaugural Bodypainting Day. And he says that only happened after a legal battle.

Golub and a model were arrested in 2011 during a body-painting project in Times Square.

The city paid model Zoe West a $15,000 settlement after she sued over the arrest. Public nudity is legal in the city if it’s part of a performance, exhibition or show.

Golub’s event Saturday included a post-painting march down Broadway and a return to Times Square for a photo shoot.
