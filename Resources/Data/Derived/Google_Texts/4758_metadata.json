Yet, while Democratic turnout was decent, along with the youth vote, the older, more Republican leaning slice of the electorate\u2013Americans 66 and older\u2013represented the larger share. Still, even with 950,000 more people voting this year than in 2010\u2013and breaking for Democrats\u2013Democratic turnout was still the lowest in three decades.\n\nOverall, the 2014 North Carolina electorate had more young people participating, and was more diverse. As Nate Cohn wrote over at the New York Times, it was a decent electorate for Democrats\u2013and they still lost. A lesson, as he put it, could be drawn on how even good electorates may not be enough for Democrats to win given their dependence on nonwhite and young voters.
