To keep prices down, the president wants the government to negotiate prices for drugs dispensed through Medicare.\n\nBut that \"solution\" derives from two false premises: First, that the federal government can get better deals than the private sector. And second, that it \"negotiates\" at all.\n\nLet's consider the second premise first. Governments don't negotiate prices \u2014 they dictate them. Federal, state, and local governments already cover about half of all health-care costs. Government can effectively name the price it will pay. If drug companies don't like the price \u2014 or if that price would cause them to lose money \u2014 tough luck.\n\nThus, government \"negotiations\" amount to de facto price controls.\n\nThe government already sets prices in Medicare, Medicaid, and the Veterans Affairs health system. All three programs are characterized by shortages, a lack of innovation, and massive consumer harm.\n\nIn Medicaid, for instance, the government dictates reimbursement rates for doctors \u2014 often below their costs. As a result, many doctors limit the number of Medicaid patients they'll see or refuse to admit them altogether.\n\nThe VA, meanwhile, directly controls the price of drugs. Shortages are the result.\n\nPrice controls also stifle innovation. On average, drug companies spend $2.6 billion to bring a drug to market. Price controls prevent firms from recouping these substantial research investments \u2014 and discourage companies from developing lifesaving drugs in the future.\n\nEven if the government were to negotiate prices, it would struggle to do much better than the private sector.\n\nConsider how Medicare Part D, the drug benefit program, has fared.\n\nUnder Part D, private insurers negotiate with drug companies to secure discounts. They must compete with one another for the best deal from drug firms. And then they must vie for seniors' business by offering a variety of plans with differing levels of benefits, cost-sharing, and coverage. Patients can then choose the plan that meets their needs and budget.\n\nBecause it's unleashed the power of competition to reduce costs and improve quality, Part D has continuously cost seniors and taxpayers less than even the government projected.\n\nAt $38.83, average monthly Part D premiums are more than $20 lower than anticipated.\n\nConsequently, taxpayer costs are 50 percent below the Congressional Budget Office's original forecasts. The federal agency has lowered its 10-year spending estimate for Part D four years in a row.\n\nPart D is single-handedly slowing the growth of health costs. The program accounts for 10 percent of Medicare spending. But it is responsible for more than 60 percent of the slowdown in such spending since 2011.\n\nThese savings haven't sacrificed quality. The most popular Part D plan covers 84 percent of drugs most commonly used by seniors \u2014 more than twice the share of the VA. Almost nine in ten enrollees report that they like the benefits they're getting.\n\nFlorida residents are reaping these benefits, too. Nearly three-fourths of the state's Medicare beneficiaries are enrolled in Part D. Orange County is home to about 150,000 enrollees, who have filled over 3 million prescriptions through the plan.\n\nWhat's more, enrollees in Florida have 33 prescription drug plan options to choose from.\n\nMedicare Part D is an example of what free-market competition can accomplish \u2014 and why the government has no business negotiating prescription drug prices.\n\nSally C.
