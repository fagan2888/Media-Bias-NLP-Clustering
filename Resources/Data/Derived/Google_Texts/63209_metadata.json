I agree. Maybe Rep. Scott Krug doesn't realize it, but someone called the Jobs First Coalition Inc. is sending mailers that have nothing to do with jobs. They say that Dana Duncan is evil for doing his job \u2014 defending his client as an attorney. It sounds in the mailer like he didn't even win the case, but doing his job is what Krug hasn't done.\n\nThe mailer also claims that property taxes went up 38 percent during Duncan's tenure on the Port Edwards School Board. Krug was also the representative for Port Edwards during this time. What did he do about it? Wisconsin Rapids property taxes also went up due to a re-evaluation of property. Gov. Scott Walker has limited how much property taxes can go up.\n\nI really like the black and red color scheme on the mailers. Makes them look more evil. Send them to the trash!\n\nTom Possley,\n\nWisconsin Rapids\n\nRead or Share this story: http://wrtnews.co/1wnfQEj", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "They lie, obfuscate and are terrible.", "og": {"site_name": "Daily Tribune Media", "description": "They lie, obfuscate and are terrible.", "title": "Letter: Toss those absurd political mailers", "url": "http://www.wisconsinrapidstribune.com/story/opinion/2014/10/23/letter-toss-absurd-political-mailers/17789371/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/wisconsinrapidstribune.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "They lie, obfuscate and are terrible.", "title": "Letter: Toss those absurd political mailers", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/0b127ef6bdeca0a7997ada31f1919c35b81de662/c=354-0-1769-1415&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/WisconsinRapids/2014/10/23/200544423-001.jpg", "creator": "@wrtribune", "site": "@wrtribune", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=885558265", "fb": {"app_id": 132335483492709}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce8e4\"", "article_summary": "Maybe Rep.
