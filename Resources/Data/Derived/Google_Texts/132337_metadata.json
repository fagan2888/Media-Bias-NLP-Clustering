Christopher Smith ( R-N.J.) sponsor of the \u201cNo Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act.\u201d (Jim Watson, AFP/Getty Images)\n\nThe IRS is good at a lot of things \u2014 sending out tax refunds, giving tax credits for child-care expenses and deductions for charitable contributions, and helping taxpayers file their income tax returns for free.\n\nBut one thing the IRS probably isn\u2019t very good at is deciding whether or not a woman has been raped.\n\nThat\u2019s why some provisions of the \u201cNo Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act\u201d don\u2019t make a whole lot of sense. H.R. 7, which is sponsored by Rep. Christopher Smith (R-N.J.), would change the tax code so that individuals may only deduct medical expenses related to abortion in cases of rape, incest or endangerment of life.\n\nThat provision seems pretty innocuous until you stop and ask: Who\u2019s supposed to decide when a medical expense is related to a pregnancy caused by rape or incest?\n\nSupporters of H.R. 7 \u2014 the bill has 164 co-sponsors, including 11 women and four Democrats \u2014 would give that authority to the Internal Revenue Service. Yes, that\u2019s right. The same organization that has been vilified for targeting certain organizations with \u201ctea party\u201d or \u201cpatriot\u201d in their names to help determine whether they qualify for tax-exempt status will be able to target individuals to make sure that they\u2019re not improperly claiming deductions for an abortion that wasn\u2019t due to rape, incest or to save the mother\u2019s life.\n\nShould the Internal Revenue Service have the authority to ask a woman to prove that she\u2019s been raped?\n\nSpeaking at Wednesday\u2019s annual March for Life in Washington, House Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-Va.) announced that \u201cnext week, the House will vote once and for all to end taxpayer funding for abortions.\u201d The House Judiciary Committee under Chairman Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.) voted 22-12 last week to send H.R. 7 to the full Congress. However, with firm opposition from President Obama and Senate Democrats, it\u2019s not likely to go anywhere.\n\nThe House passed an earlier version by a 251-175 vote in 2011. It\u2019s the latest version of the act that amends the tax code and establishes the tax man\u2019s role in determining the validity of a woman\u2019s medical expense deduction.\n\nDuring a 2011 House Ways and Means committee hearing on an earlier version of the bill, Rep. Mike Thompson (D-Calif.) feared that \u201cit may require that the IRS snoop into what American women are doing with their own money.\u201d By contrast, Rep. Trent Franks (R-Ariz.) who chairs the House Judiciary Subcommittee that held a hearing on H.R. 7 on January 9, seems to believe that the incidence of pregnancy after rape is so low that it\u2019s not worth taking into special consideration.\n\nGiven that many people don\u2019t want the IRS prying into their personal lives, it seems hard to believe that they would be comfortable sending an IRS auditor into a woman\u2019s bedroom and asking her such intensely personal questions. This discomfort is likely to rise in cases in which a woman who has been a victim of rape may be under emotional distress not just because of the rape but also from the abortion.\n\nMany Republican co-sponsors of the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion bill, which would increase the IRS\u2019s role in an individual\u2019s health matters, have simultaneously said that the IRS shouldn\u2019t have access to taxpayers\u2019 health-care information. Last August, Rep. Martha Roby (R-Ala.) co-sponsored H.R. 2009, the Keep the IRS Off Your Health Care Act, which passed the House last summer. Rep. Diane Black (R-Tenn.) told Newsmax that the IRS has \u201cno business accessing or monitoring Americans\u2019 personal health information.\u201d Rep. Michelle Bachmann (R-Minn.) has warned against granting the IRS access to people\u2019s health-care information, while Rep. Renee Ellmers (R-N.C.) has said that \u201cwe cannot allow the IRS to have any say over our health and wellbeing.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s here where many abortion opponents and foes of the IRS run into a conundrum. While they don\u2019t want to give the IRS any money to implement the Affordable Care Act, they do want the IRS involved in enforcing the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act.\n\nRegardless of how its supporters view the IRS, implementing the tax provisions of H.R. 7 requires the IRS to get involved with the health-care system. If the IRS suspects that a taxpayer has made an improper claim, then it may audit the taxpayer\u2019s income tax return and ask the taxpayer to prove that the expenses relate to a legally permissible deduction. As Thomas A. Barthold, chief of staff of Congress\u2019s nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation, explained in 2011, the taxpayer generally has the \u201cburden of proof\u201d in documenting a claim. In other words, if the IRS asks, the taxpayer must answer.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that Rep. Martha Roby (R-Ala.) introduced the Keep the IRS Off Your Health Care Act. The bill was introduced by Rep.
