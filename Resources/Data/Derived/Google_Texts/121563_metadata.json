In fact, as your editorial points out, our pets are generally treated well and have legal protections, while farm animals are treated horribly and have virtually no protection from abuse.\n\nSo if one\u2019s goal is to cause the least possible cruelty to animals, it would actually be ethically preferable to eat a well-treated dog or cat rather than an abused chicken or pig. The choice for all of us who oppose cruelty is clear: We should not be eating any animals.\n\nBRUCE FRIEDRICH\n\nWashington\n\nThe writer is director of policy for Farm Sanctuary, a farm animal protection group that is a plaintiff in the Idaho court case discussed in the editorial.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "opinion", "ptime": 20150820032100, "twitter": {"description": "Farm Sanctuary writes, \u201cWe should not be eating any animals.\u201d", "title": "Morality and Animals", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/20/opinion/morality-and-animals.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003848427"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_150_black.png", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/20/opinion/morality-and-animals.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003848427", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/20/opinion/morality-and-animals.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "opinion", "hdl_p": "Morality and Animals", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "Aug. 20, 2015", "edt": "NewYork", "keywords": "Animal Abuse  Rights and Welfare,Ethics (Personal),Meat", "news_keywords": "Meat", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "Farm Sanctuary writes, \u201cWe should not be eating any animals.\u201d", "tom": "Letter", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "description": "Farm Sanctuary writes, \u201cWe should not be eating any animals.\u201d", "CG": "opinion", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "Aug. 20, 2015", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "Letter", "article": {"section_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/pages/opinion/index.html", "section": "Opinion", "modified": "2015-08-20", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "tag": "Meat", "published": "2015-08-20", "section-taxonomy-id": "AD8090D7-4137-4D71-84C8-70DA3BD89778"}, "slug": "20Lfarm", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20150820032100, "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/20/opinion/morality-and-animals.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_291_black.png", "type": "article", "description": "Farm Sanctuary writes, \u201cWe should not be eating any animals.\u201d", "title": "Morality and Animals"}, "pdate": 20150820, "des": "Meat", "articleid": 100000003848427, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "Morality and Animals", "col": "Letter", "PST": "Letter"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3c62\"", "article_summary": "The choice for all of us who oppose cruelty is clear: We should not be eating any animals.\nIn fact, as your editorial points out, our pets are generally treated well and have legal protections, while farm animals are treated horribly and have virtually no protection from abuse.\nTo the Editor:Thank you for noting the cognitive dissonance that finds many Americans lavishing love on tens of millions of dogs and cats, even as we allow the grotesque slaughter of close to nine billion farm animals a year (\u201cExposing Abuse on the Factory Farm,\u201d editorial, Aug. 9).\nSo if one\u2019s goal is to cause the least possible cruelty to animals, it would actually be ethically preferable to eat a well-treated dog or cat rather than an abused chicken or pig.\nThere is no moral difference between abusing and eating a pig or a dog, a cat or a chicken."}
