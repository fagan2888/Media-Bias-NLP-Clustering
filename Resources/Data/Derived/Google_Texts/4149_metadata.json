Reports are mixed on whether his paralysis stemmed from a stroke or a car accident.\n\nHis deteriorating health had left him no choice but to turn himself in to receive medical treatment \u2014 he had no Social Security number under his alias and therefore no medical coverage.\n\n\"I need to make this right and get through this,\" Moore reportedly told Franklin County Sheriff Pat Melton.\n\nUnder Kentucky law, jails must take from their budget to pay for indigent prisoners' medical care.\n\n\"You can't make this up,\" Melton told NBC on Tuesday.\n\nMoore's neighbors in Frankfurt said they had never noticed anything strange about him \u2014 for the past six years he had simply been the \"frail, bearded man\" next door.\n\n\"I'm shocked,\" one of Moore's former neighbors, Edward Jordan, told WLEX. \"I can't believe it.\n\n\"He's a diabetic and I'm a diabetic,\" Jordan said. \"And we'd sit on the porch and talk about that.\"\n\nMoore was arraigned Tuesday after receiving a full medical examination and is being held without bond in the Franklin County Regional Jail.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#185f7c", "sailthru.author": "Natasha Bertrand", "application-name": "Business Insider", "twitter": {"description": "He says he \"wanted to make things right.\"", "title": "A man on the run for 40 years turned himself in to police so he could get healthcare", "url": "http://www.businessinsider.com/a-man-on-the-run-for-40-years-turned-himself-in-to-police-so-he-could-get-health-care-2015-4", "image": "http://static4.businessinsider.com/image/5537a27e6da811326684b11b-506-253/a-man-on-the-run-for-40-years-turned-himself-in-to-police-so-he-could-get-healthcare.jpg", "creator": "NatashaBertrand", "site": "BI_Lawandorder", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.verticals": "law", "linkedin": {"owner": "mid:1d5f7b"}, "sailthru.tags": "Crime, Jail , Prisoners, Law and Order, Kentucky, Prison, Health Care, Arrest, Natasha Bertrand", "news_keywords": "Crime, Jail , Prisoners, Law and Order, Kentucky, Prison, Health Care, Arrest, Natasha Bertrand", "author": "Natasha Bertrand", "sailthru.date": "2015-04-22", "sailthru.title": "A man on the run for 40 years turned himself in to police so he could get healthcare", "theme-color": "#185f7c", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://static1.businessinsider.com/image/5537a278ecad0484708fddb6-50-50/a-man-on-the-run-for-40-years-turned-himself-in-to-police-so-he-could-get-healthcare.jpg", "description": "He says he \"wanted to make things right.\"", "tbi-image": "http://static5.businessinsider.com/image/5537a278ecad0484708fddb6/a-man-on-the-run-for-40-years-turned-himself-in-to-police-so-he-could-get-healthcare.jpg", "fb": {"app_id": 155043519637}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://static1.businessinsider.com/assets/images/us/favicons/mstile-144x144.png?v=BI-US-2016-03-31", "date": "2015-04-22", "article": {"publisher": "businessinsider", "author": "http://www.businessinsider.com/author/natasha-bertrand"}, "sailthru.description": "He says he \"wanted to make things right.\"", "viewport": "width=1024", "og": {"site_name": "Business Insider", "description": "He says he \"wanted to make things right.\"", "title": "A man on the run for 40 years turned himself in to police so he could get healthcare", "url": "http://www.businessinsider.com/a-man-on-the-run-for-40-years-turned-himself-in-to-police-so-he-could-get-health-care-2015-4", "image": "http://static2.businessinsider.com/image/5537a27e6da811326684b11b-1190-625/a-man-on-the-run-for-40-years-turned-himself-in-to-police-so-he-could-get-healthcare.jpg", "type": "article"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Business Insider", "title": "A man on the run for 40 years turned himself in to police so he could get healthcare", "sailthru.image.full": "http://static5.businessinsider.com/image/5537a278ecad0484708fddb6/a-man-on-the-run-for-40-years-turned-himself-in-to-police-so-he-could-get-healthcare.jpg", "tbi-vertical": "law"}, "article_summary": "A man who had been on the run from the law for nearly 40 years turned himself in to authorities on Monday because he wanted to go back to prison for the healthcare, according to NBC.\n\"He's a diabetic and I'm a diabetic,\" Jordan said.\n\"I'm shocked,\" one of Moore's former neighbors, Edward Jordan, told WLEX.\n\"I need to make this right and get through this,\" Moore reportedly told Franklin County Sheriff Pat Melton.\nMoore was arraigned Tuesday after receiving a full medical examination and is being held without bond in the Franklin County Regional Jail."}
