This one\u2019s being called a \u201cgaffe,\u201d but it\u2019s not like he was making fun of that country\u2019s \u201cbacon,\u201d or \u201ccurling\u201d or \u201cwhiskey,\u201d now was he? Heck, she wasn\u2019t even in a wheelchair, so for OHJB, this was a pretty good day.\n\nOur Canadian visitor \u2014 no doubt here for emergency surgery, which is unavailable in that socialist hellhole to the north \u2014 was far too polite to tell the VPOTUS to take a flying touque at a rolling poutine; instead, she just smiled and nodded, and told the news people afterward that she looks forward to the day when America gets its healthcare act together, too:\n\n\u201cI just didn\u2019t know if I should say, \u2018I\u2019m sorry, uh, Canadian, don\u2019t know if I can help you out, or\u2026\u2019 He\u2019s for it and I\u2019m for it and I hope it works out here.\u201d\n\nAnd so you have a collision of memes: Joe Biden being a little situationally clueless, and a Canadian being too polite to correct him. It could have gone worse, we suppose; if she\u2019d overcome the reticence natural to her people, she might have made embarrassing comparisons between Obamacare\u2019s patched-together insurance plans and a genuine single-payer system. Now that might have been a gaffe.\n\n[Mediaite]", "article_metadata": {"description": "There's just something about Old Handsome Joe Biden that makes this kind of thing happen: Joe was in Scottsdale, Arizona, last week, and a local teevee news", "generator": "Powered by Visual Composer - drag and drop page builder for WordPress.", "author": "Doktor Zoom", "og": {"url": "http://wonkette.com/542977/old-handsome-joe-biden-tries-to-sell-canadian-on-obamacare", "image": "http://img.wonkette.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/default.png", "title": "Old Handsome Joe Biden Tries To Sell Canadian On Obamacare"}, "twitter": {"description": "There's just something about Old Handsome Joe Biden that makes this kind of thing \u2026", "creator": "@wonkette", "url": "http://wonkette.com/542977/old-handsome-joe-biden-tries-to-sell-canadian-on-obamacare", "image": "http://img.wonkette.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/default.png", "title": "Old Handsome Joe Biden Tries To Sell Canadian On Obamacare", "site": "@wonkette", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "And sure, the nice young lady, \u201cJackie,\u201d turned out to be Canadian, but how was Joe supposed to know that without seeing the flag on her backpack?\nHeck, she wasn\u2019t even in a wheelchair, so for OHJB, this was a pretty good day.\nThis one\u2019s being called a \u201cgaffe,\u201d but it\u2019s not like he was making fun of that country\u2019s \u201cbacon,\u201d or \u201ccurling\u201d or \u201cwhiskey,\u201d now was he?\nThere\u2019s just something about Old Handsome Joe Biden that makes this kind of thing happen: Joe was in Scottsdale, Arizona, last week, and a local teevee news crew caught him doing his Biden Magic \u2014 sitting down next to a smiling young woman and urging her to enroll in Obamacare, because health insurance for the youngs is a good thing, and your parents will be reassured that you\u2019re covered.\nNow that might have been a gaffe."}
