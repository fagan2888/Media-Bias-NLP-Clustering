Rebecca Rebar, the cutter\u2019s executive officer.\n\nThe newly repaired cutter is primarily used for living marine resources - or fisheries enforcement - law enforcement, and search and rescue. The Chandeleur typically does one seven- to-10 day patrol per month when it\u2019s in service, Rebar said Thursday.\n\nThe Naushon, also an Island-class patrol boat, and the 175-foot, Keeper-class coastal buoy tender Anthony Petit also are stationed at Ketchikan.\n\n\u201cIt just depends on what the mission is when we go out each time,\u201d she added.\n\nRebar, who\u2019s been in the Coast Guard for about 2.5 years, arrived in Ketchikan in June and went on one patrol on the Chandeleur before it went into dry dock.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s pretty much the same for most of the guys on the crew,\u201d Rebar said. \u201cWe had a really big crew turnover this year.\u201d\n\nEven with the nearly six months in the dry dock, it could be another week and a half to four weeks before the Chandeleur is ready to go on patrol, according to Rebar.\n\nThe Chandeleur, being stationed in Southeast Alaska, can be impacted by debris - such as logs - in the water and sudden weather shifts, Rebar said.\n\nWork done on the Chandeleur included cleaning and inspecting various tanks - fuel, water and sewage - that couldn\u2019t be accessed while the cutter was in the water, cleaning the engine room and welding on new sections of hull plating, according to Engineering Petty Officer Marcus Trapp, a 16-year Coast Guard veteran who\u2019s been on the Chandeleur for about 2.5 years.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve done quite a bit of work, quite a bit of work,\u201d Trapp said Thursday.\n\nWhile it was the Chandeleur\u2019s turn on the maintenance schedule, some issues that were found after it got out of the water extended its time in the dry dock, according to Rebar.\n\n\u201cEverything went really smooth, it\u2019s just the extent of the hull plating work that had to be done wasn\u2019t known until the boat was pulled out of the water,\u201d Trapp said.\n\nTrapp added that both the amount and quality of work the base\u2019s industrial team did in the few months the Chandeleur was in dry dock was \u201cincredible,\u201d which Rebar agreed with.\n\n\u201cA lot of the maintenance was orchestrated by Base Ketchikan\u2019s industrial team, and they\u2019re really the specialists that did all of the hull plate welding,\u201d Rebar said. \u201d \u2026 They did an awesome job on everything. They did a lot of work.\u201d\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Ketchikan (Alaska) Daily News, http://www.ketchikandailynews.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "The U.S. Coast Guard Base Ketchikan saw one of its two Island-class patrol boats return to the water at the end of 2014.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "The U.S. Coast Guard Base Ketchikan saw one of its two Island-class patrol boats return to the water at the end of 2014.", "title": "Coast Guard cutter overhaul completed", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jan/18/coast-guard-cutter-overhaul-completed/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/01/13/043295bb1c4b25026b0f6a706700e3c8.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/01/13/043295bb1c4b25026b0f6a706700e3c8.jpg", "description": "The U.S. Coast Guard Base Ketchikan saw one of its two Island-class patrol boats return to the water at the end of 2014.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Coast Guard cutter overhaul completed"}, "Author": "MATT ARMSTRONG", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1e39\"", "article_summary": "KETCHIKAN, Alaska (AP) - The U.S. Coast Guard Base Ketchikan saw one of its two Island-class patrol boats return to the water at the end of 2014.\nRebar, who\u2019s been in the Coast Guard for about 2.5 years, arrived in Ketchikan in June and went on one patrol on the Chandeleur before it went into dry dock.\nThe newly repaired cutter is primarily used for living marine resources - or fisheries enforcement - law enforcement, and search and rescue.\nThe Chandeleur typically does one seven- to-10 day patrol per month when it\u2019s in service, Rebar said Thursday.\nWhile it was the Chandeleur\u2019s turn on the maintenance schedule, some issues that were found after it got out of the water extended its time in the dry dock, according to Rebar."}
