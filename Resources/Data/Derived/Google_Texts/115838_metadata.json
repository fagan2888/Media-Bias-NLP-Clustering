Andreessen Horowitz partner Scott Weiss aptly predicted his guest post titled \u201c30 New Franchises\u201d a few weeks ago, there a massive opportunity to create new multi-billion-dollar enterprise franchises despite incumbents throwing massive amounts of money to acquire these franchises. These companies, such as Box and many others, are choosing to stay independent. Weiss himself should now\u2013he sold his enterprise company IronPort Systems to one of the most well known incumbents in the space, Cisco, back in 2007. And we decided to create an enterprise panel at Disrupt SF around Weiss\u2019 predictions, with the CEO\u2019s of Box, Zendesk and Nebula (you can still buy tickets here).\n\nWe sat down with Weiss to hear more about his theories behind \u201c30 Franchises.\u201d You can read the entirety of our conversation below.\n\nLeena Rao: Describe the basic premise around your guest column about 30 New Franchises.\n\nScott Weiss: Absolutely! So I think I am just trying to point out a couple of things around the enterprise opportunity. Quite honestly I think this is the best time I\u2019ve ever seen to be an investor in enterprise technology. I don\u2019t know how long you\u2019ve been a beat reporter for enterprise, but I can\u2019t imagine a more boring job over the last 20 years. Just think about Oracle, Microsoft, beating earnings by a penny, they buying another company. There was just nothing that dramatic or that interesting going on.\n\nAnd now all of a sudden it like that all the major enterprise companies are vulnerable, and not just a little bit vulnerable, but vulnerable like everything is changing underneath them.\n\nLet\u2019s talk about Microsoft for a minute. Microsoft\u2019s dominance in the enterprise was always predicated on 97 percent PC market share, and everything was kind of born out of that because the Microsoft stack was not just what was on the PCs, but it was all the email and with Exchange and SharePoint. And plus, once they were in the enterprise, they were also able to shove in all kinds of other products.\n\nNow between the tablets \u2014 as fast as we went from PCs to laptops, we\u2019re going to go from laptops to tablets, and Microsoft is nowhere to be found; and not only are they nowhere to be found, but they made, I believe, such a strategic error by holding back Office thinking that that was going to be their trump card. When we finally come out with a tablet it\u2019s going to run the office, and it won\u2019t run anywhere else, well, that went over like a lead balloon, right?\n\nLR: Right.\n\nSW: So now, again, they are going through a big transition, and then you think about Oracle who had been buying up every single one of the on-prem software makers including PeopleSoft. There are four or five of the companies that they bought across every application stack. And then lo and behold, all of them are going SaaS, and hats off to Larry Ellison that he did invest early. I think he is a majority owner of NetSuite.\n\nThis is the best time I\u2019ve ever seen to be an investor in enterprise technology.\n\nSo I kind of joked that at some point he may just go over and take the CEO role at NetSuite. There may be a jump as he realizes that this isn\u2019t a whole rollup that he did with Oracle. Almost like a Computer Associates-like rollup. It feels like NetSuite might actually be the better bet because that platform and that business is much more attuned to all the businesses that he will probably be buying. That might be a better vehicle than Oracle itself, which is a really interesting issue.\n\nSo it\u2019s a long way of saying that the incumbents don\u2019t have the skills, don\u2019t have the wherewithal necessary to compete in this new world, and I don\u2019t think the acquisitions are working. Having been at Cisco when they bought a SaaS company which was IronPort, they don\u2019t have the systems to sell IronPort, the salespeople, the comp plan, it just goes a different culture of running a 24\u00d77 services organization as opposed to selling boxes into the data center.\n\nLR: So I think that\u2019s a good segue into my next question, which is, what changed? I would say there was a flurry of acquisitions happening with incumbents picking up whether they\u2019d be a billion-dollar company or several-hundred-million-dollar company or even a smaller acquisition. What changed in companies like Box and so on and so forth turning down acquisition offers, and instead pursuing independence?\n\nThere is a lot of talk about how the enterprise as consumer cooled off in the public markets. Enterprise has heated up I think because of companies like Workday and others. And so, is it because there is now this real sort of excitement from Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley around enterprise and they actually feel like they can stay independent and not have to go down the route of acquisition?\n\nSW: Well, I think you\u2019ve got two interesting data points. One of those data points are Salesforce and Workday, and those two founders of those companies are not going to sell. If you know the story of Marc Benioff and coming out of Oracle and the story of David Duffield and Aneel Bhusri you\u2019ll understand. With the later two founders, they got their company kind of stolen out from under them, and these are two entrepreneurs that said, all right, never again. We\u2019re not selling, not for sale for any price. And look at the prodigal that was in the other side of those two companies.\n\nOne is 10 billion, the other one is just 30 billion. And so if you have the guts, like Aaron Levie, to stay the course, there is a major franchise on the other end of that line, and these are entrepreneurs that are not going to sell at any price.\n\nLR: So where does this lead incumbents if they can\u2019t apply some of these game-changing technologies in SaaS mobile, the data center. Are they just going to become the dinosaurs?\n\nSW: Sure, so for years Computer Associates\u2019 side of strategy of buying up the old \u2014 because these technology changes take years and years and years. And so the Computer Associates strategy was, we\u2019re going to buy these technology companies. We\u2019re going to mop up all these \u2014 kind of all this old technology and raise the service prices and just kind of live off those annuities and they look for years off of that and they are like, you could certainly see Oracle follow that strategy.\n\nSalesforce was never architected for the type of cloud computing that\u2019s going on at Facebook and Google, and so they\u2019re going to have to react to that.\n\nThere are going to be people that are going to be living on Oracle for years before they go off and all the kind of the legacy PeopleSoft and they can certainly raise prices almost with impurity. So I think that\u2019s a potential strategy. I think they can try to change as well, like they can try to make the leap. I just think the premise of the 30 New Franchises is, it\u2019s going to be really, really hard for them to cross the chasm.\n\nThere\u2019s just too many things changing at once, and I even look at a company like Salesforce. Salesforce was never architected for the type of cloud computing that\u2019s going on at Facebook and Google, and so they\u2019re going to have to react to that. And they also were never architected for mobile, and that\u2019s another thing they are going to have to react to.\n\nIf you are in an incumbent, you can certainly react to one big technology change and maybe you can react to two. The premise of the post is, I don\u2019t think you can react to three.\n\nLR: So you mentioned how some of these franchises are competing for talent especially in the design area. I want you to sort of expand a little bit on that. How does 30 New Franchises affect talent and recruiting in the enterprise?\n\nSW: So the interesting part about mobile, and this is very specific to mobile and the mobile experience, is that you have a very small palette to work with. The mobile phone is almost like a remote control, when I think of like a TiVo remote control: you push a button and something happens. And you look at some of the great mobile apps like Lyft or Instagram; where literally you walk outside, you push here I am, and a car shows up to pick you up or you push Instagram.\n\nAnd that type of ease-of-use with just limited functionality has been so far removed from the enterprise world. And so in order to get those kind of innovations that a Lyft or an Instagram put on a mobile device for consumers, you are going to need kind of a completely new class of UI designer that are incredibly hard to hire. And you can imagine these folks coming out of Rhode Island School of Design or other places where they just kind of the best user interface places in the world that are in hot demand. And this demand comes from consumer companies which hit the personality of a designer a lot better than an enterprise company.\n\nHow do you get them to go work for an enterprise company? It\u2019s not like you can just go pay the money, it has to be a culture where their work is appreciated and where a great design is revered.\n\nI remember hearing those early stories of Apple where, if you worked in manufacturing in Apple, it was like the worst job in the world, right? I remember this story about Steve Jobs \u2014 didn\u2019t want a seam on a couple of the aluminum products, whether it\u2019d be an iPod or a MacBook, and they had to get flying in these aluminum extruding machines from Sweden in order to accomplish it. And I remember the manufacturing people were just going nuts and he was just like, I don\u2019t care, like go figure it out, that\u2019s your job. And I just don\u2019t think enterprises \u2014 enterprises are just, in general, designed for manufacturability, designed for efficiency, and not designed for aesthetics or designed for ease-of-use. And this is a bit of a sea change when it comes to mobile.\n\nAnd so I think they are going to have a really hard time hiring them. Something that I put in the post was, all of our consumer companies, even though they had great designers for web, had a complete \u201coh shit\u201d moment around trying to find designers for mobile.\n\nAnd even if you look at a company like Facebook, they must have hired on or acquired 10-plus mobile teams over the last few years if you look at all the teams they acquired in addition to buying Instagram. That\u2019s a real reaction to mobile. None of the enterprise companies have had that kind of reaction yet.\n\nLR: For example Box acquiring Crocodoc\u2013that\u2019s a bet on mobile.\n\nSW: I would not doubt it. I think that Box is expanding its use-case and then also getting much better at mobile. But Box was kind of made for mobile. I mean, the great thing about the whole thing about Box was that it makes it very easy to transfer files on and off your computer and your mobile phone and make it a seamless experience.\n\nLR: Some of the companies you mentioned are early stage, some of the companies you mentioned are later stage, who may be at the brink of, within the next year, becoming a public company or going up on that path.\n\nIs there a risk for some of these later-stage companies that could become these franchises, turning into the incumbents, and do you think that the CEOs of these companies are thinking more thoughtfully about how not to be blind to disruption?\n\nSW: Well, I think they have now \u2014 there has been enough folks that have sold. When you sell a company to somebody that doesn\u2019t know what to do with it, it ultimately dies. Sometimes it dies a slow painful death. I think there are now enough companies that have sold the SaaS company to an incumbent where you can\u2019t sell the product, it doesn\u2019t mesh with their existing product line, it\u2019s painful.\n\nAll of our consumer companies, even though they had great designers for web, had a complete \u201coh shit\u201d moment around trying to find designers for mobile.\n\nI think that the Salesforces and the Workdays of the world will have a much easier time of integrating a company and making that company successful, because it kind of looks and smells like what they are already doing.\n\nIn the early days of Cisco, when Cisco was acquiring other switch and router technologies, those executives stayed on for 10 or 15 years at Cisco and helped Cisco become the company that it is today.\n\nWhen you go so far afield to acquire companies that are just doing some things that are so different than what you are doing, if it doesn\u2019t snap into an existing product line or if it\u2019s not something that\u2019s easy for the existing Salesforce to sell, it\u2019s just a bad experience for that acquired company that acquired management team.\n\nAnd so I think word has gotten around a bit that if you are going to go \u2014 it\u2019s not just like you are selling your company, all your employees are now going to have to go through this experience. The combination of it being a bad experience if somebody doesn\u2019t know what to do with this particular type of company, it\u2019s less of an appealing option to sell the company because I think most entrepreneurs say, okay, I am graduating to a bigger poker table, right?\n\nLike I was playing kind of in the regionals and now I am going to the world series of poker when I sell a company to a company and I feel like I am kind of moving up. But if you are selling a company where the likely case is it\u2019s just the money and they are going to slowly kill the company, that\u2019s not a very exciting prospect.\n\nSo the combination that you have Salesforce and Workday, that have these amazing market caps, it looks like they are plowing new ground in the enterprise, and you have these affordable experiences of selling companies to incumbents that don\u2019t know what to do with these startups, because it just looks and feels and smells so different than what an incumbent is used to doing. I think that that\u2019s the opportunity for the 30 New Franchises.\n\nLR: Where do you feel like there is still a huge opportunity for disruption in the enterprise?\n\nSW: I don\u2019t think I really emphasize just how magical I believe a CRM app can be. You know that I\u2019ve just called that person, you can look at my dialer and the notion of dialing out on my phone to a customer is actually something I should be logging into my CRM app and it does it automatically or when I arrive at a customer\u2019s side, it knows my location from GPS and pulls up everything I need, including new sources and other things that might have happened in the last 10 minutes that I might be able to surprise the customer or delight the customer with.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "<a href=\"/author/leena-rao/\" title=\"Posts by Leena Rao\" onclick=\"s_objectID='river_author';\" rel=\"author\">Leena Rao</a> <span class=\"twitter-handle\">(<a href=\"https://twitter.com/leenarao\" rel=\"external\">@leenarao</a>)</span>", "application-name": "TechCrunch", "twitter": {"description": "The future of enterprise software is anything but boring.
