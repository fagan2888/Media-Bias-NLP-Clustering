He and his wife were left largely with unfamiliar clinics dozens of miles away, as he tells it.\n\nBut now it\u2019s too late to switch plans and keep the federal subsidy that helps reduce premiums under the Affordable Care Act, he said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m stuck with them,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not fair.\u201d\n\nOther complaints have sounded similar themes: \u201cWhen you finally come to the doctor in 2016, you discovered that doctor that was in network upon your signing to the plan actually is not included,\u201d said \u201cLyudmila of Lakeland\u201d on consumeraffairs.com.\n\nPrivately, an official at one regional doctor group said it was puzzled by claim denials from Florida Blue early in 2016 and heard little concern from the insurer when the doctors warned they might be forced to leave the plan \u2014 and soon did so.\n\nThe problems come after a series of developments including a GOP-led Congress\u2019s blocking of billions of dollars in \u201crisk corridor\u201d funding designed to help health insurers cushion losses in exchange plans.\n\nUnitedHealthcare, the biggest health insurer in the country, said last month that it plans to exit most Affordable Care Act exchanges by 2017.\n\nSo the question arises: Is Florida Blue taking steps to make its own plan unattractive because it fears it is too financially risky?\n\n\u201cNo, that is not the case at all,\u201d said Florida Blue spokesman Paul Kluding. \u201cSince the launch of the Affordable Care Act\u2019s marketplace, Florida Blue has offered plans in every county in the state of Florida, and we remain committed to providing health care to all Floridians through the marketplace.\u201d\n\nThis issue is \u201climited to one, new marketplace product, which is designed to provide access to affordable health care to more Floridians,\u201d Kluding said. \u201cThis product is focused on improving health outcomes, and therefore, requires greater engagement and collaboration among the patient, the doctor, and Florida Blue. This need for greater engagement has resulted in some modifications to the doctors available in this network, including some who have chosen to no longer participate in this product.\u201d\n\nFlorida Blue is not trying to back out of exchange coverage, he said.\n\n\u201cGiven the fluctuation of insurers\u2019 participation in the marketplace, there is a significant chance Florida Blue will be the only statewide plan in 2017,\u201d Kluding said. \u201cUnlike other insurers that select only certain counties, we are dedicated to improving the health of all Florida communities while adhering to our mission of helping people and communities achieve better health.\u201d\n\nAs for problems in places like Palm Beach County, Kluding said, \u201cWe apologize for, and truly regret, any challenges our members have experienced. This year in certain markets, we introduced a new localized health care product, named myBlue, aimed at providing more Floridians access to affordable care.\u201d\n\nHe continued, \u201cWe have learned of some issues in Palm Beach County related to selecting a primary care doctor. Due to recent changes in the network, some of the myBlue members in Palm Beach County were assigned new primary care doctors, and a small percentage of those have had delays getting appointments. We are actively assisting members with finding convenient primary care doctors and helping them get appointments.\u201d\n\nIn Boynton Beach, Gordon said Florida Blue assigned a caseworker he credits with \u201cdiligently helping\u201d the family find better options for doctors close to them.\n\nThe Florida Office of Insurance Regulation said it is checking on the problem.\n\n\u201cThe Office will be speaking with Florida Blue to discuss this issue,\u201d spokeswoman Amy Bogner said.\n\nFlorida Blue says it leads the state in total customers with more than 4 million. The merged companies of Aetna and Humana appear on track to collect the most annual premium dollars in the state.\n\nFlorida Blue leads in total complaints about health insurers to the state\u2019s Department of Financial Services since Jan. 1, 2015, according to information requested by The Palm Beach Post. Complaint numbers below are for all products and services, not just Affordable Care Act exchange plans.\n\n\u201cWe take member concerns very seriously,\u201d Kluding said. \u201cAs the leading insurer in the state, Florida Blue has more than 4 million members in Florida, and the number of issues reported should be considered in the context of our large membership base.\u201d\n\nComplaints since Jan. 1, 2015\n\nCompany Complaints\n\nFlorida Blue 1552\n\nUnitedHealthcare of Fla. 682\n\nHumana Medical Plan 466\n\nCoventry Health Care 417\n\nHealth Options Inc. 324\n\nSource: Florida Department of Financial Services", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "Protecting Your Pocket", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"url": "http://protectingyourpocket.blog.palmbeachpost.com/2016/05/05/florida-blue-customers-smell-bait-and-switch-on-obamacare-plan/", "image": "https://cmgpbpprotectingyourpocket.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/071713-met-florida-blue4.jpg?w=300", "type": "article", "description": "One of Florida's largest health insurers is facing complaints\u00a0 about confusing claim denials and disappearing doctors in 2016, leading some consumers to protest they did not get what they bargained for in Florida Blue's Obamacare coverage.\r\n\r\nThe company, also known as Blue Cross & Blue Shield of Florida, has apologized and insists it is working hard on problems that have surfaced in Palm Beach County in particular.\r\n\r\nBut that does not wipe...", "title": "Florida Blue customers smell bait and switch on Obamacare plan | Protecting Your Pocket"}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://protectingyourpocket.blog.palmbeachpost.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/0eb717cde8a67beef4209846aa3f6a28?s=16", "keywords": "health insurance, affordable care act, blue cross & blue shield of florida, bnblogs, florida blue, mobile breaking business, myblue, news, newsfeed, obamacare", "viewport": "width=1024", "description": "One of Florida's largest health insurers is facing complaints\u00a0 about confusing claim denials and disappearing doctors in 2016, leading some consumers to protest they did not get what they bargained for in Florida Blue's Obamacare coverage."}, "article_summary": "Florida Blue says it leads the state in total customers with more than 4 million.\n\u201cThe Office will be speaking with Florida Blue to discuss this issue,\u201d spokeswoman Amy Bogner said.\nSo the question arises: Is Florida Blue taking steps to make its own plan unattractive because it fears it is too financially risky?\nBut now it\u2019s too late to switch plans and keep the federal subsidy that helps reduce premiums under the Affordable Care Act, he said.\nComplaint numbers below are for all products and services, not just Affordable Care Act exchange plans."}
