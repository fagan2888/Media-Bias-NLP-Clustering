The group, whose success has prompted some senior, longtime Republicans to seek membership, is also planning a \u201cContract with America\u201d-style manifesto of legislative proposals that it will lobby GOP leaders to take up.\n\nThat policy agenda will outline what fights the hard-line members most care about and detail how they view their role within the caucus. Expect issues like Obamacare and spending to be at the forefront.\n\nThe caucus, which has had a mixed record since forming in February, will have plenty of chances in the coming weeks to test its strength. Its members are itching for a fight over any attempt by leaders to revive the dormant Ex-Im Bank. And they\u2019ll continue to push to repeal parts or all of Obamacare, even if those votes have failed dozens of times and are bound to fall short again.\n\n\u201cWe need to show our vision of where we need to go,\u201d Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan, the caucus\u2019 chairman, said during a recent interview in his Capitol Hill office. \u201cYou know why 65 percent of Republicans don\u2019t think we\u2019re doing what we said we were going to do? Because we\u2019re not. We have a chance now, an opportunity now, to do what we said we were going to do.\u201d\n\nIt appears that GOP leadership is paying the group more attention \u2014 for now. Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy of California and Majority Whip Steve Scalise of Louisiana called Freedom Caucus members over the weeklong Fourth of July recess to discuss upcoming legislation. And Committee on Energy and Commerce Chairman Fred Upton of Michigan dispatched a top lieutenant, Rep. Joe Pitts of Pennsylvania, to meet with the caucus about what the panel is planning.\n\nThat inclusion is what Freedom Caucus members say they\u2019ve been seeking from Speaker John Boehner\u2019s team all along.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re going to try and corral us all, you\u2019re going to have to make us feel like we\u2019re part of the process,\u201d said Rep. Matt Salmon (R-Ariz.), a Freedom Caucus member. \u201cFrom what I\u2019ve seen they are trying to reach out. They\u2019ve done it in the past, and it lasts for a time, and then they go back to their old ways. But they have to realize what motivates us and that there are consequences if you cross a line.\u201d\n\nThe caucus made its presence felt last week, when GOP leadership had to struggle to pass a rewrite of a controversial education bill over conservative objections. The No Child Left Behind measure cleared the House, but with no votes to spare.\n\nMembers are also expanding their agenda to include social issues after spending the five months since the caucus\u2019 creation focusing mostly on economics. On Thursday, the caucus backed a provision from Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) and Rep. Ra\u00fal Labrador (R-Idaho) that would block the federal government from denying tax exemptions to groups that refuse to serve gays if the decision is based on religious beliefs.\n\nThey are asking for a vote on the bill before August.\n\nThe conservatives scored a major legislative win when the Ex-Im Bank expired at the end of June. The government bank has long been in the cross hairs of conservatives who call it a prime example of \u201ccrony capitalism.\u201d\n\nLong known as the \u201cHell No\u201d Caucus, the conservatives are looking for ways to turn their chest-thumping opposition into real legislative gains. In some ways, the Freedom Caucus is growing more sophisticated. It built an internal whip counter that informs the cardinals of the group how each member plans to vote. Members are drafting the policy platform, expected to be issued in the coming weeks. And they are trying to change their reputation as a bunch of yellers who don\u2019t actually want to get anything done.\n\n\u201cLoud actions are necessary when there is a crisis. But if you go around doing loud actions all the time, pretty soon you\u2019re a joke. You\u2019re a caricature of something,\u201d Salmon said. \u201cI think responses have to be measured and have to be in concert with what is happening at the time.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe average person is going to scratch their head and say, \u2018What in the heck is going on up there?\u2019\u201d Rep. Dave Brat (R-Va.) said of the political agenda of the Republican Party. \u201cOur group has the intent of getting to yes with leadership \u2026 there is stuff being spun\u201d that it is anti-Boehner. \u201cThat\u2019s all false.\u201d\n\nThe real question, added Brat \u2014 who came out of nowhere to upset then-House Majority Leader Eric Cantor last year \u2014 is why leadership doesn\u2019t listen more often to \u201c35 to 40 members who have solid principled objections that match our philosophy.\u201d\n\nNorth Carolina Rep.

Their political wins have garnered widespread attention, even if they haven\u2019t been able to persuade GOP leaders to wholly include members in policy decisions yet. After they focused widespread media attention on Boehner\u2019s deal making with Democrats on trade as well as a change in how doctors who treat Medicare patients are reimbursed, members said they saw a spike in interest in joining the group.\n\nThe caucus has about 40 members but refuses to provide a roster. A source close to the caucus said the nine founding members have heard from about 60 members total who are seriously interested in joining. Eight-term Rep. Darrell Issa (R-Calif.), former chairman of the powerful Oversight and Government Reform Committee, is poised to became a member.\n\nBut the Freedom Caucus has turned away lawmakers who it doesn\u2019t believe will advance its cause or are more interested in headlines about themselves, that source said.\n\nThe group\u2019s tactics have won it few friends outside a relatively narrow contingent of conservatives. Much of the Republican Conference believes the hard-liners are interested only in stopping progress. Critics say the group will often ask for a laundry list of changes to legislation that includes a few reasonable items, then hold out unless it gets everything.\n\nWhen leadership decides, as if it often does, that it\u2019s easier to cull votes from moderate Republicans or Democrats, Boehner has gone around the Freedom Caucus.\n\nThat\u2019s generally when the caucus decides to fight back \u2014 as it did during the trade debate.\n\nJordan had asked for three concessions in the trade package but was rebuffed by Ways and Means Chairman Paul Ryan of Wisconsin and GOP leadership. That rejection turned out to be a momentary setback. Dozens of conservatives teamed up with Democrats to force down a trade assistance bill before the measure ultimately passed a week later.\n\nBut the vote spurred a bigger revolt among conservatives.\n\nDays later, Boehner and his top deputies removed three members from the whip team and, along with Oversight Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah), stripped Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) of his subcommittee gavel on the committee. But the punishment didn\u2019t last long.\n\nDigging through obscure committee bylaws, Freedom Caucus members identified a provision stating that a committee chairman\u2019s selection or dismissal of a subcommittee chairman could be overruled by a majority of his party\u2019s lawmakers on the panel. The oversight panel is stacked with Freedom Caucus members, and within the week they forced the reinstatement of Meadows.\n\nThe episode made conservatives look stronger and Boehner and his leadership team appear feckless and unable to manage the conference.\n\nRebelling against the Meadows punishment \u201cwas 100 percent the right thing to do,\u201d Salmon said. \u201cBut after that, if you just keep kicking someone when they are down, that\u2019s a mistake, too. No one is going to respect an entity that sits by while somebody abuses them. No one will respect you.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "They outfoxed John Boehner.
