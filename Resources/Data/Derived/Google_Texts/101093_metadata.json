NBC 6 Investigator Tony Pipitone reports. (Published Wednesday, Nov. 19, 2014)\n\nAll over South Florida, the word \u201cObamacare\u201d appears on building signs, vans, fliers, yard signs, business cards and placards twirled by streetside hawkers directing traffic to or advertising storefront insurance agencies trying to get clients signed up for health insurance.\n\nBut the insurance agency behind 11 of those storefronts, doing business as the Obamacare Help Center, is drawing the attention of the state Department of Financial Services because its business name includes the word \u201cObamacare.\u201d\n\nJoel Fink is an owner of Fink Wealth Management LLC, the licensed insurance agency which also owns the name \u201cObamacare Help Center,\u201d used to attract business to its offices, from Palmetto Bay to West Palm Beach.\n\nAnd the state has a problem with that one word: Obamacare.\n\nWhen Fink tried to get an insurance agency license for a corporation called Obamacare Help Center Inc., the state in August rejected the application, saying the \u201cuse of this name would mislead the public and possibly violate \u2026 statute.\u201d\n\nFlorida law says the department may reject a name that may imply it\u2019s a state or federal agency.\n\nChris Cate, spokesman for chief financial officer Jeff Atwater, said the department objects to \u201cObamacare\u201d being in the name of a corporation or any other name marketed to the public .\n\n\u201cThe issue we have with the name is that it could potentially confuse consumers into thinking this agency is actually part of the federal government,\u201d Cate told Team 6 Investigators in an interview from Tallahassee.\n\nBut Fink said there is no confusion.\n\n\u201cWe simply explain we\u2019re an independent insurance agency. We\u2019re here to assist them at no cost to them,\u201d Fink said, adding his company makes money from commission or fees paid by the insurance companies that ultimately provide policies to his customers.\n\nAnd, technically speaking, he said, \u201cObamacare\u201d is not in his company\u2019s name.\n\nThe storefronts display the insurance agency license of Fink Wealth Management, which owns the Obamacare Help Center \u201cfictitious name\u201d \u2013 the name registered with the Florida Department of State and used in business permits, signage, fliers and other materials.\n\nFink said he has abandoned efforts to have the corporation Obamacare Help Center Inc. licensed as an insurance agency. He said he believed the state limited its objection only to that corporate name.\n\nBut Cate said if Obamacare Help Center is being used by the agency in its dealings with the public -- whether as a fictitious or corporate name -- the department could take action.\n\nFink argues he is not alone using Obamacare to market his insurance services.\n\n\u201cAll you have to do is drive up and down the street and you see the name Obamacare all over the place,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s the name people know.\u201d\n\nA few blocks away from Fink\u2019s office, Team 6 found \u201cObamacare Enrollment Center\u201d and \u201cObamacare Free Enrollment Center\u201d being used on signs advertising other insurance agencies.\n\nBut Cate noted the word \u201cObamacare\u201d is not banned from advertising; it simply may not be in the corporate or fictitious names those insurance agencies use. (A search of public records by Team 6 Investigators found those agencies calling their offices \u201cenrollment centers\u201d are not using Obamacare in their corporate or fictitious names.)\n\nAs for Fink\u2019s operation, \u201cthe company is not authorized to be operating under the name Obamacare Help Center,\u201d Cate said. \u201cSo, if that is the case, we will be going to check out the business.\u201d If violations are found, the agency could be fined.", "article_metadata": {"description": "All over South Florida, the word \u201cObamacare\u201d appears on building signs, vans, fliers, yard signs, business cards and placards twirled by streetside hawkers directing traffic to or advertising storefront...", "title": "State Warns Company: Drop the Word &quot;Obamacare&quot;", "og": {"site_name": "NBC 6 South Florida", "description": "All over South Florida, the word \u201cObamacare\u201d appears on building signs, vans, fliers, yard signs, business cards and placards twirled by streetside hawkers directing traffic to or advertising storefront...", "title": "State Warns Company: Drop the Word \"Obamacare\"", "url": "http://www.nbcmiami.com/news/local/State-Warns-Company-Drop-the-Word-Obamacare-283275341.html", "image": "http://media.nbcmiami.com/images/1200*675/obamacarebiz111914.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "All over South Florida, the word \u201cObamacare\u201d appears on building signs, vans, fliers, yard signs, business cards and placards twirled by streetside hawkers directing traffic to or advertising storefront...", "creator": "@nbc6", "url": "http://www.nbcmiami.com/news/local/State-Warns-Company-Drop-the-Word-Obamacare-283275341.html", "image": "http://media.nbcmiami.com/images/1200*675/obamacarebiz111914.jpg?ak=bc", "title": "State Warns Company: Drop the Word \"Obamacare\"", "site": "@nbc6", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "taboola_lead": "video", "robots": "noodp,noydir", "tp": {"preferredRuntimes": "Flash,HTML5", "FlashBlacklist": "None|None", "preferredFormats": "mpeg4,m3u,webm,ogg,flv,F4M"}, "fb": {"app_id": 91295312088}, "keywords": "local news, miami news,  name news, breaking news, south florida, South Beach, Miami Beach, Palm Beach, Miami-Dade County, Broward County, Kendall, Homestead, North Miami Beach, Westchester, Pembroke Pines, Hollywood, Plantation, Bal Harbour, Aventura, Boca Raton, West Palm Beach, Coral Gables, Miami, South Florida, Fl", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/NBCMiami"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, user-scalable=yes"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd18a0\"", "article_summary": "As for Fink\u2019s operation, \u201cthe company is not authorized to be operating under the name Obamacare Help Center,\u201d Cate said.\nOfficials are concerned after several signs have popped up in South Florida advertising Obamacare help centers that are not affiliated with the federal government.\nFink said he has abandoned efforts to have the corporation Obamacare Help Center Inc. licensed as an insurance agency.\nAnd the state has a problem with that one word: Obamacare.\n\u201cWe simply explain we\u2019re an independent insurance agency."}
