You never know when we're going into these buildings what we're going to encounter. There are all kinds of dangers and things that we can\u2019t see.\"\n\nThe building isn't really on fire, but a smoke machine sure gives the impression it is. This is what it looks like trying to see inside a smoky building or house.\n\n\"These recruits are going into heavily smoke charged rooms, and then they have to locate the firefighter and drag him out to safety,\u201d he said.\n\nThey've never been inside this building before and are learning the terrain as they go just like they would in a real emergency. When the smoke is just too thick to see they use thermal imaging.\n\nLast year, there were 91 on-duty firefighter deaths in the US, and in 2013 nearly 30,000 firefighters were injured on the job.\n\n\"This is a really good opportunity for them to come out here today and get in an actual building as opposed to just a fire station or a building they're familiar with,\u201d Fulkerson said. \u201cIt's really good training to go into something where you have no idea where anything is.\"\n\nThe academy lasts 16 weeks, and the 31 recruits of this class will graduate February 5th.\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"wn-build": "XSLT-7.1-17", "Description": "News 9 got a first-hand look at what it's like to go into a burning house and fight down a fire.", "author": "Joleen Chaney", "og": {"url": "http://www.news9.com/story/30823726/okc-fire-department-cadets-undergo-house-fire-training", "image": "http://KWTV.images.worldnow.com/images/9521928_G.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "News 9 got a first-hand look at what it's like to go into a burning house and fight down a fire.", "title": "OKC Fire Department Cadets Undergo House Fire Training"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://KWTV.images.worldnow.com/images/9521928_G.jpg", "description": "News 9 got a first-hand look at what it's like to go into a burning house and fight down a fire.", "card": "summary", "title": "OKC Fire Department Cadets Undergo House Fire Training"}, "wnreadableurl": "okc-fire-department-cadets-undergo-house-fire-training", "ROBOTS": "index,follow,noarchive", "owner": "KWTV", "fb": {"app_id": 538140636230283}, "date": "2015/12/23", "KEYWORDS": "House Fire, firefighters, fire, training, Oklahoma City Fire Department, okc, news 9, kwtv", "wn-version": "ContainerE-Story", "wn-base": "IIS15", "verify-v1": "d5ZN+GNiazjgWlnr3WHikwraMvFljdUSLMgex4CGnc8=", "news_keywords": "House Fire, firefighters, fire, training, Oklahoma City Fire Department, okc, news 9, kwtv"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9ac8\"", "article_summary": "News 9 got a first-hand look at what it's like to go into a burning house and fight down a fire.\n\"We train all the time to save citizens, but sometimes we have to save ourselves,\u201d Benny Fulkerson of the Oklahoma City Fire Department said.\nThis is what it looks like trying to see inside a smoky building or house.\nThey've never been inside this building before and are learning the terrain as they go just like they would in a real emergency.\nThe building isn't really on fire, but a smoke machine sure gives the impression it is."}
