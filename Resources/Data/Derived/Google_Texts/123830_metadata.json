The Education Trust Fund is not expected to have enough growth to fully cover the PEEHIP shortfall.\n\nDiane Scott, chief financial officer for RSA, gave a presentation to the PEEHIP board Monday on examples of ways to close the gap.\n\nAmong the examples: higher premiums to cover spouses who are not members, higher co-pays for office visits and higher co-pays for some generic drugs and specialty drugs.\n\n\n\nThe board took no action on those ideas.\n\nThe board approved a new tiered structure for premiums but with no dollar amounts attached to the tiers. The tiers would be: member only, member plus children, member plus spouse and member plus children and spouse.\n\nCurrently, there are only two tiers. Active employee members pay $15 a month for individual coverage and $162 a month for family coverage.\n\nOfficials said it was necessary to begin setting up the new tiers now with the possibility of setting premiums for those tiers next year.\n\nThe board approved a recommendation by the staff to remove Walgreens from the PEEHIP network unless it agrees to lower some drug costs.\n\nRSA Deputy Director Donald Yancey said Walgreens charges significantly more for some drugs than other pharmacy chains. Yancey said dropping Walgreens from the network would not cause a hardship to members because the network includes the other large pharmacy chains.\n\nScott outlined some of the changes in PEEHIP mandated by the Affordable Care Act:\n\n\n\n--- Coverage extended for adult children up to age 26.\n\n--- Removal of the $1 million lifetime maximum on the hospital medical plan.\n\n--- No pre-existing condition waiting period for children younger than 19; no pre-existing condition waiting period for any member beginning Oct. 1, 2014.\n\n--- No deductible, co-pay or co-insurance for some preventive services.\n\n--- No deductible, co-pay or co-insurance for FDA-approved contraceptives.\n\nScott said ACA mandates already implemented are costing PEEHIP about $20 million a year. She said the annual cost could go much higher, although she said there are many variables that could affect that, including changes the board could make to adjust to the new law.\n\nBoard member Bill Newton, who is the state finance director, asked what would be the annual cost of ACA mandates to PEEHIP if no changes are made. Scott said she would compile that number and report it to board members.\n\nIn September, the State Employees' Insurance Board increased some premiums and made other changes to help close a funding shortfall in that insurance program.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "news", "title": "Alabama education employees could face higher premiums, co-pays to close $220 million insurance shortfall", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Alabama education employees could face higher premiums, co-pays to close $220 million insurance shortfall\", \"link\": \"http://blog.al.com/wire/2013/12/alabama_education_employees_co.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://www.al.com/static/aff/static/img/logos/logo_fb.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"11755599\", \"pub_date\": \"2013-12-03T12:46:14Z\", \"author\": \"Mike Cason | mcason@al.com\", \"tags\": [\"@river-montgomery\",\"@river-state\"] }", "twitter": {"image": "http://www.al.com/static/aff/static/img/logos/logo_fb.jpg", "creator": "@MikeCasonAL", "site": "@aldotcom", "card": "summary", "description": "Level funding in recent years, rising costs and mandates of the Affordable Care Act are among the factors in the shortfall."}, "article_date_updated": "Tuesday, December 03, 2013,  7:47 AM", "parsely-metadata": "{\"short_title\": \"\", \"image_url\": \"\", \"author_name\": \"mikecason\", \"author_nickname\": \"Mike Cason | mcason@al.com\", \"author_id\": \"8026786\", \"source_blog_name\": \"Retired: Real-Time News from AL.com\", \"source_blog_url\": \"http://blog.al.com/wire/\", \"sponsored_content\": \"0\" }", "og": {"site_name": "AL.com", "description": "Level funding in recent years, rising costs and mandates of the Affordable Care Act are among the factors in the shortfall.", "title": "Alabama education employees could face higher premiums, co-pays to close $220 million insurance shortfall", "url": "http://blog.al.com/wire/2013/12/alabama_education_employees_co.html", "image": "http://www.al.com/static/aff/static/img/logos/logo_fb.jpg", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "AL.com", "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Tuesday, December 03, 2013,  6:30 AM", "article_author": "Mike Cason | mcason@al.com", "Description": "Level funding in recent years, rising costs and mandates of the Affordable Care Act are among the factors in the shortfall."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3ffb\"", "article_summary": "The Public Education Employees\u2019 Health Insurance Plan, PEEHIP, provides health insurance for 97,000 active employees and 81,000 retirees.\nIn September, the State Employees' Insurance Board increased some premiums and made other changes to help close a funding shortfall in that insurance program.\nAmong the examples: higher premiums to cover spouses who are not members, higher co-pays for office visits and higher co-pays for some generic drugs and specialty drugs.\nEmployees could face higher premiums and co-pays in some cases because the Legislature is not expected to be able to fully close the gap.\nThe state appropriation is based on the number of active employees, which means the relative increase in retirees contributes to the shortfall."}
