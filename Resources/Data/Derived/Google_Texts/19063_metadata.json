But it took only 50 minutes on Friday for Superior Court Judge Frank Pfiffner to strike down an attempt by the Alaska Legislative Council, a body of the Alaska Legislature, to stop expansion in Alaska.\n\nIn his oral decision \u2014 a written one could not be produced in the 22 hours since he heard oral arguments \u2014 Pfiffner said attorneys for the Legislative Council didn\u2019t make the case that an injunction was needed to prevent \u201cirreparable harm\u201d to the Council or the state.\n\n\u201cThe court concludes there is no irreparable injury, at least for the fiscal year 2016,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s no administrative cost for the state ... in this fiscal year.\u201d\n\nPfiffner\u2019s decision doesn\u2019t conclude the Council\u2019s lawsuit \u2014 it simply means that Medicaid expansion will go on while the lawsuit progresses. Pfiffner himself said he expects that the suit will make its way to the Alaska Supreme Court for resolution.\n\nExpansion would permit many Alaskans who earn up to 138 percent of the federal poverty line to receive federally subsidized health insurance. The state has estimated that about 20,000 Alaskans will sign up for coverage once expansion takes effect, and past studies say up to 40,000 Alaskans could be eligible.\n\nDuring his campaign for governor, Bill Walker pledged that Medicaid expansion would be a \u201cday one\u201d decision for his administration. It turned out to be more complicated. The governor first sought to push the matter through the Alaska Legislature, which proved reluctant.\n\nNo expansion bill came up for a vote during the Legislature\u2019s regular session this spring, and a special session \u2014 held partially to address expansion \u2014 didn\u2019t result in hearings, let alone votes, on the matter.\n\nAfter the special session, Walker announced he would unilaterally expand the program.\n\nThat prompted the Legislative Council, a body that takes action for the Legislature during the period between sessions, to vote 10-1 in favor of allocating $450,000 for legal services to pay for a lawsuit to stop expansion.\n\nThe \u201cyes\u201d votes on the measure came from the Republican-led House and Senate majority, while the sole \u201cno\u201d vote came from Rep. Sam Kito III, D-Juneau. Several Republican members of the council were absent from the vote or declined to vote, and some of the absent members later said they would not have voted in favor of the lawsuit spending.\n\nThe Council\u2019s vote took place Aug. 18, and preparations for a lawsuit moved forward rapidly to beat the scheduled Sept. 1 start of the expansion program. The suit was filed less than a week later, and Pfiffner heard oral arguments on Thursday before delivering his decision Friday.\n\nIn a statement after the decision, Walker said by email, \u201cJudge Pfiffner\u2019s ruling today ensures 20,000 working Alaskans will have access to health care on Sept. 1. Medicaid expansion will not only save the state (more than) $100 million in its first six years, it will save Alaskan lives. I look forward to working with members of the legislature on implementing the Healthy Alaska Plan.\u201d\n\nDuring the hearing, Pfiffner explained that in order to receive an injunction or a temporary restraining order to stop the program\u2019s start, the Council\u2019s attorneys needed to meet several legal \u201ctests.\u201d In the \u201chardship test\u201d, the council\u2019s attorneys needed to demonstrate that their case was likely to succeed, that proceeding without an injunction would cause them \u201cirreparable harm\u201d and that the injunction wouldn\u2019t put the state at a disadvantage if the case progressed.\n\nPfiffner said the council attorneys failed two of those benchmarks. Because the federal government will pay 100 percent of the program\u2019s costs in the first year and the Alaska Mental Health Trust has agreed to pay administrative startup costs, the state isn\u2019t at immediate risk of financial harm.\n\nFurthermore, Pfiffner said, \u201cIf the system does careen out of control ... well, what can happen? The state of Alaska can opt out of the Medicaid expansion.\u201d\n\nMore importantly, for the long-term health of the Council\u2019s case, Pfiffner said he didn\u2019t buy its central argument: That Medicaid expansion involves providing coverage to an \u201coptional\u201d coverage group or a group of people \u201crequired\u201d to be covered under the law.\n\n\u201cI say this case turns on the meaning of one word: requires,\u201d Pfiffner said in part, then later added, \u201cthis court concludes that the medicaid expansion group meets the required language.\u201d\n\nIf the Legislative Council continues to pursue its opposition to Medicaid expansion, attorneys likely will appeal to the Alaska Supreme Court, which has discretion to accept or reject the case.\n\nWith Anchorage courts closed for the weekend and for the visit of President Barack Obama, any action won\u2019t happen before Sept. 1, allowing the program to start unfettered.\n\n\u2022 Contact James Brooks at james.k.brooks@juneauempire.com or at 523-2258.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Alaska, Juneau, newspaper, news, legislature, capital, Mendenhall, Douglas, southeast, Douglas Island, Gastineau Channel, Mendenhall Glacier, Auke Bay, Salmon Creek, Lemon Creek, Switzer Creek, Mendenhall Valley, Fritz Cove, Lynn Canal, Tee Harbor, Local, JAMES BROOKS, Bill Walker, Frank Pfiffner, Kake, Empire, juneauempire, juneauempire.com, Outdoors, Weather, All access, e-edition, iPad, Sports, Real Estate, Jobs, Cars, Homes, Art, Arts & Culture, Neighbors", "og": {"site_name": "Juneau Empire - Alaska's Capital City Online Newspaper", "description": "Medicaid expansion will go forward Tuesday, Sept. 1. \nIt's been five years since the Affordable Care Act became law and three years since Medicaid expansion effectively became a state option.", "title": "Medicaid moves forward", "url": "http://juneauempire.com/local/2015-08-28/medicaid-moves-forward", "image": "http://juneauempire.com/sites/default/files/14330935_0.jpg", "type": "article"}, "description": "Find the latest news, crime, weather, business and community information from juneauempire.com and the Juneau Empire."}, "article_summary": "During his campaign for governor, Bill Walker pledged that Medicaid expansion would be a \u201cday one\u201d decision for his administration.\nIt\u2019s been five years since the Affordable Care Act became law and three years since Medicaid expansion effectively became a state option.\nMedicaid expansion will go forward Tuesday, Sept. 1.\nMedicaid expansion will not only save the state (more than) $100 million in its first six years, it will save Alaskan lives.\nPfiffner himself said he expects that the suit will make its way to the Alaska Supreme Court for resolution."}
