There has been some grumbling.\u201d\n\nMichael Mullin, president of Cathedral, told TODAY.com the plan has been in the making for about four years, and that \u201call of the school\u2019s 655 students and 45 teachers have a MacBook Air laptop at their disposal.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur students are used to conducting many of their learning experiences on their laptop machines, whether school happens to be in session or not,\u201d Mullin told TODAY.com. \u201cIt\u2019s been very methodical. \u2026 It was just a very logical next step for us.\u201d\n\nCathedral senior Tommy Auger told Weather.com that working from home \u201cdidn\u2019t feel much different than a day in class\u201d and that he\u2019d rather save his days off for summer.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to think ahead, but it\u2019s definitely better,\u201d said Auger.\n\nBrittany Corona, a research assistant for The Heritage Foundation\u2019s Institute for Family, Community, and Opportunity, said:\n\n\u201cDigital learning is on the rise, allowing students access to quality education anytime, anywhere.
