Burwell case. If King wins, Floridians\u2019 Obamacare health insurance premium tax credits would cease unless the subsidies could be routed through a state exchange. At risk is $3.8 billion now helping Floridians pay their premiums.\n\nBut wait, there\u2019s more to like about SB 7044: The FHIX bill would protect the health of safety-net hospitals which are about to lose up to $1.9 billion in federal funds for something called the Low Income Pool, a program that helps pay for emergency care to uninsured patients. That\u2019s critically important to Palm Beach County\u2019s St. Mary\u2019s and Lakeside medical centers.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act sunsets the LIP program, but Gov. Rick Scott\u2019s administration has been lobbying for it to be extended just for Florida. The Obama administration is saying that money\u2019s gone. But Scott is in such denial that he has spent the fictional money in his proposed budget. That could not only create a crisis for hospitals that serve the poor, it could crater Scott\u2019s hopes for big business tax cuts this year.\n\nIf the Obama administration accepts Florida\u2019s Medicaid FHIX, it would bring in far more than the lost LIP money. It would bring in an estimated $5 billion a year in federal Medicaid support.\n\nBarely a month ago, Florida\u2019s legislative leaders were insisting they had no plans to consider Medicaid expansion this session. So what changed? Key business groups, especially Associated Industries of Florida (AIF), rose up and demanded action.\n\n\u201cThis bill is important to business and it is acceptable to business because it is a free-market, private-sector, consumer choice-based private insurance plan that will help Florida residents who are not eligible or cannot afford coverage in our state\u2019s existing market structure,\u201d AIF said in a video statement praising Senate leaders.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A new bill passed by the Senate Health Policy Committee would allow an estimated 800,000 low-income Floridians who don\u2019t qualify for Medicaid.", "application-name": "The Opinion Zone", "og": {"url": "http://opinionzone.blog.palmbeachpost.com/2015/03/17/florida-senates-fhix-for-medicaid-expansion-are-you-sold-yet/", "image": "https://cmgpbpopinionzone.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/fla_medicaid_card.jpg?w=300", "type": "article", "description": "A new bill passed by the Senate Health Policy Committee would allow an estimated 800,000 uninsured, low-income Floridians who don\u2019t qualify for Medicaid and fall beneath the Obamacare threshold to apply for coverage through a new \u201cFlorida Health Insurance Affordability Exchange Program,\u201d aka FHIX.\r\n\r\nUnder SB 7044, the state-based insurance exchange would be positioned to FHIX something else: It could become the rescue plan to guarantee another 1 million Floridians...", "title": "Florida Senate\u2019s FHIX for Medicaid expansion: Are you sold yet? | The Opinion Zone"}, "generator": "WordPress.com", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "viewport": "width=1024", "keywords": "obamacare, medicaid expansion, florida, senate, legislature, lip", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://opinionzone.blog.palmbeachpost.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/c7ddd238d18006116126146c6757e906?s=16", "news_keywords": "Obamacare, Medicaid expansion, Florida, Senate, Legislature, LIP"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf597\"", "article_summary": "If the Obama administration accepts Florida\u2019s Medicaid FHIX, it would bring in far more than the lost LIP money.\nIf King wins, Floridians\u2019 Obamacare health insurance premium tax credits would cease unless the subsidies could be routed through a state exchange.\nBarely a month ago, Florida\u2019s legislative leaders were insisting they had no plans to consider Medicaid expansion this session.\nA new bill passed by the Senate Health Policy Committee would allow an estimated 800,000 uninsured, low-income Floridians who don\u2019t qualify for Medicaid and fall beneath the Obamacare threshold to apply for coverage through a new \u201cFlorida Health Insurance Affordability Exchange Program,\u201d aka FHIX.\nKey business groups, especially Associated Industries of Florida (AIF), rose up and demanded action."}
