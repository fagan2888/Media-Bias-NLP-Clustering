From Staff Reports

A pilot was killed late Saturday afternoon when his home-made single-engine airplane crashed at Mid-Way Regional Airport in Ellis County, authorities said.

The pilot, who had not been identified, was the plane’s only occupant, Federal Aviation Administration spokesman Lynn Lunsford said.

Texas Department of Public Safety Trooper James Colunga confirmed the death. Officials are withholding the man’s name pending notification of next of kin.

The cause of the crash is unknown, Colunga said. But witnesses said the pilot was performing flying maneuvers over the runway in the home-built Skybolt bi-plane when the crash occurred, Lunsford said.

National Transportation Safety Board officials are on their way to the scene. They are expected to arrive Sunday, Colunga said. The runway will be closed until the investigation has concluded.
