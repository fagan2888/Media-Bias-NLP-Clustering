With about 600 people arriving at the reception center from South Sudan every day, relief agencies are stretched to their limit.\n\n\n\nofficial MintPress sponsor official MintPress sponsor\n\nBut amid all the deprivation and hardship, one refugee at Nyumanzi, the largest of the camps in the Adjumani district, has opened a small drugstore, serving mostly malaria patients. \u201cI buy these drugs,\u201d Elijah Choi, a former lab technician and supervisor at a hospital in South Sudan, told the Observer. \u201cThey are not a donation.\u201d\n\nNear Choi\u2019s shop, several women sell unprocessed milk and another refugee operates a tailoring machine, earning up to about $3.85 a day.\n\nAccording to a new report on refugee economies, such entrepreneurial activity is not all that unusual in the camps of Uganda, which now hosts more than 317,000 refugees from countries including South Sudan, Somalia, Rwanda, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia, Kenya and Burundi.\n\n\u201cDespite the constraints placed on displaced populations by their regulatory environment, vibrant economic systems often thrive below the radar,\u201d the report, titled \u201cRefugee Economies: Rethinking Popular Assumptions,\u201d says.\n\nResearchers from the University of Oxford, England, who surveyed 1,593 refugees in Uganda\u2019s Nakivale and Kyangwali settlements and in the country\u2019s capital, Kampala, concluded that their data debunks a number of popular myths about refugees, among them that refugees are economically isolated, are a burden on host states, are technologically illiterate, and depend on humanitarian assistance.\n\nRefugees \u201cbuy and sell goods and services not only within Uganda but globally,\u201d Alexander Betts, a co-author of the report and a professor of refugee studies at Oxford, told MintPress News.\n\nIn Nakivale, for example, Somali shops stock everything from basic kitchen goods to hard-to-find luxury products such as perfumes and electronics. One trader imports his best-selling item, canned tuna, from Thailand via Dubai and Kenya, using Somali-run trade networks.\n\nThe report argues that \u201cthe existing paradigm [of refugee assistance] fails to adequately recognize that refugees and other displaced persons have talents, skills, and aspirations. A rethink is urgently needed.\u201d By adopting a new model that encourages refugee economies and self-reliance, it says, host states and aid groups can help free refugees from long-term dependency.\n\nAccording to Betts, more than two-thirds of refugees and other displaced populations are in so-called \u201cprotracted situations,\u201d meaning they have been displaced for more than five years. The average length of stay in a camp is well over a decade.\n\n\u201cThis is a human tragedy,\u201d Betts said. \u201cIt\u2019s also bad for donors who pour resources into a model based on long-term dependency. With new refugee crises around the world, we cannot afford to consign a whole generation of Syrian young people, for example, to the kinds of long-term protractedness that has been endured by Somalis, Palestinians and others.\u201d\n\nCenters of economic gravity\n\nUganda\u2019s history with refugees dates back to before its independence from Britain, when about 10,000 Polish nationals, mostly women and children, sought sanctuary there during World War II. Conditions for refugees have often been brutal. In 2002, Human Rights Watch reported that refugees in one Kampala neighborhood slept on 10 foam mattresses in a cement room measuring 30-by-30 feet.\n\n\u201cEach mattress belonged to one family,\u201d the report said. \u201cOne man with ten children explained that they had to take turns sleeping on their one mattress.\u201d\n\nIn 2006, Uganda passed legislation that was seen as a model for Africa. The Refugee Act gave refugees the right to work, freedom of movement and the right to live in settlements rather than in refugee camps.\n\nThe law \u201cepitomizes Uganda\u2019s unwavering liberal policy towards refugees who seek protection here until they feel it is safe for them to return to their countries of origin\u201d and would enable refugees to \u201cfend for themselves by growing crops, attain food security and avail themselves of other human basic needs,\u201d then-Prime Minister Apolo Nsibambi said at a World Refugee Day ceremony in June 2009.\n\nAccording to another recent report by Oxford\u2019s Refugee Studies Centre, \u201cthe issue of how to understand and support the livelihoods of refugees has emerged as a pressing agenda due to the large number of protracted refugee situations globally. One of the major difficulties UNHCR faces in prolonged displacement is diminished donor interest in supporting these long-term refugees. As a result, assistance programs for protracted refugee situations have been constantly deprived of adequate funding.\u201d\n\nBetts, who heads the Humanitarian Innovation Project at Oxford, says he and his research team decided to focus on Uganda \u201cprecisely because it\u2019s toward the positive end of the spectrum. Our aim was to explore what is possible when refugees are given basic economic freedoms.\u201d\n\n\u201cAlthough it\u2019s not perfectly implemented, the 2006 Act enshrines self-reliance,\u201d he added. \u201cMany host countries do not even have refugee legislation.\u201d\n\nThe field research was conducted last year, with researchers interviewing Congolese, Somali and Rwandan refugees in Nakivale, Congolese and South Sudanese in Kyangwali, and Congolese, Somalis and Rwandans in Kampala.\n\n\u201cThere is a lack of research that examines the economic lives of refugees and displaced populations,\u201d the new Oxford report notes. \u201cThe limited research that exists is mainly focused on refugee livelihoods or economic impacts on the host state.\u201d\n\nWhat the researchers found, the report says, was a \u201crefugee community that is nationally and transnationally integrated, contributes in positive ways to the national economy, is economically diverse, uses and creates technology, and is far from uniformly dependent on international assistance.\u201d\n\nThe researchers\u2019 observations of daily life \u201cshowed refugee settlements functioning as centers of economic gravity, attracting people and capital from all over Uganda and, in turn, playing a crucial role in the agricultural supply chain of the country.\u201d\n\n\u201cSince refugees came in, we have received a number of economic and social benefits from them,\u201d a former executive of the Kyangwali district council told researchers. \u201cSchool, road, clinic \u2014 all improved due to their presence. It is hard to imagine Kyangwali\u2019s economy without the refugees\u2019 presence.\u201d\n\nTechnological literacy\n\nBetts was particularly surprised by the extent of refugees\u2019 economic networks. \u201cFrom the cross-border export of maize and sorghum, to the Congolese import of fabrics and jewelry from India and China, to Somalis\u2019 import of tuna from Thailand, refugees are globalized,\u201d he told MintPress.\n\nAnother surprise, according to Betts, was that refugees in Uganda create jobs, including for Ugandan nationals. In Kampala, for instance, more than 20 percent of refugees employ others, and of those, some 40 percent are Ugandans.\n\nEmployment is a two-way street. In a Kampala shopping complex, the report says, Ugandan-run jewelry shops employ Congolese refugees as shop assistants to facilitate business with Congolese refugee buyers who don\u2019t speak the local language.\n\nThe report devotes considerable space to the technological literacy of refugees, noting, among other things, that roughly 70 percent of rural refugees regularly use mobile phones to communicate, even though, due to limited access, Internet use is only available to around 10 percent.\n\nIn Nakivale, one Somali refugee operates a computer game business, charging a small fee for the use of games that he purchases on trips to nearby towns. The games are played on television sets he buys used in the settlement.\n\nNakivale also offers an Internet cafe. Demou-Kay, a young Congolese refugee, works there every day on a laptop computer, using the Internet connection to edit videos. He constructed a radio transmitter out of used electrical parts and a mobile phone and runs the settlement\u2019s only radio station, generating income by charging a small fee for song requests.\n\nRefugees \u201cinnovate and use technology in their daily lives,\u201d the report says. \u201cFacilitating this form of \u2018bottom-up\u2019 innovation may offer a non-traditional way of enhancing refugees\u2019 own capacity to develop sustainable opportunities.\u201d\n\nThe report recommends that refugees\u2019 skills and talents be nurtured through education, skills development, access to microcredit and financial markets, business incubation, and improved Internet access.\n\nUnderstanding the economic systems of refugees, the researchers argue, \u201cmay hold the key to rethinking our entire approach to refugee assistance.\u201d\n\nBetts admits there is a risk that if refugees fend for themselves, that might lead to donors prematurely withdrawing assistance \u2014 which has happened in Uganda. But he is not \u201carguing for a withdrawal of assistance or suggesting that international protection is not crucial.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are simply suggesting,\u201d Betts explained, \u201cthat [aid] needs to be supplemented by an approach that recognizes and nurtures refugees\u2019 skills, talents, and aspirations.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Refugees have vibrant economies that \u201cthrive below the radar.\u201d They aren\u2019t necessarily the aid-reliant burden popular myth would make them out to be.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "AUTHOR": "Matthew Heller", "og": {"site_name": "MintPress News", "description": "Refugees have vibrant economies that \u201cthrive below the radar.\u201d They aren\u2019t necessarily the aid-reliant burden popular myth would make them out to be.", "title": "Report: Promoting Refugees\u2019 Self-Reliance Offers New Model For Aid", "url": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/report-promoting-refugees-self-reliance-offers-new-model-aid/193492/", "image": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/1-Refugees_in_transit_from_the_border_with_DRC_to_Rwamwanja_Uganda_9086821264.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-07-03T17:29:43-05:00", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Refugees have vibrant economies that \u201cthrive below the radar.\u201d They aren\u2019t necessarily the aid-reliant burden popular myth would make them out to be.", "creator": "@MintPressNews", "image": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/1-Refugees_in_transit_from_the_border_with_DRC_to_Rwamwanja_Uganda_9086821264.jpg", "title": "Report: Promoting Refugees\u2019 Self-Reliance Offers New Model For Aid", "site": "@MintPressNews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"admins": 100003161352196}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/MintpressNewsMPN", "section": "Foreign Affairs", "tag": "United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees", "published_time": "2014-07-04T05:00:33-05:00", "modified_time": "2014-07-03T17:29:43-05:00"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdbd08\"", "article_summary": "It is hard to imagine Kyangwali\u2019s economy without the refugees\u2019 presence.\u201dTechnological literacyBetts was particularly surprised by the extent of refugees\u2019 economic networks.\nReport: Promoting Refugees\u2019 Self-Reliance Offers New Model For AidRefugees have vibrant economies that \u201cthrive below the radar.\u201d They aren\u2019t necessarily the aid-reliant burden popular myth would make them out to be.\nDemou-Kay, a young Congolese refugee, works there every day on a laptop computer, using the Internet connection to edit videos.\nIn a Kampala shopping complex, the report says, Ugandan-run jewelry shops employ Congolese refugees as shop assistants to facilitate business with Congolese refugee buyers who don\u2019t speak the local language.\n\u201cThere is a lack of research that examines the economic lives of refugees and displaced populations,\u201d the new Oxford report notes."}
