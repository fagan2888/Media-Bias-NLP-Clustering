And apparently a lot of these women are getting them removed for the sake of having a smooth-looking tummy to expose in crop tops, including celebrities.\n\nThere has been a 20 percent increase in the numbers of young women, mostly aged 20 to 40 years old, who are getting thread veins removed, according to experts at Dr. Newmans Clinic \u2014 a network of thread vein removal clinics in the UK. \u201cWhereas the top two most common areas women have thread veins treated are on their faces and legs, recently we have seen a sharp rise in the number of 20 to 40-year-old women coming in with concerns about thread veins in the subcostal margin, and this area is now the third most common part of the body for treatment,\u201d Dr. Peter Finigan, medical director at Dr. Newmans Clinic, told the Daily Mail.\n\nSome women may have a genetic predisposition for thread veins on their stomach, but others develop thread veins from heavy drinking, copious amounts of sun, hormones, and pregnancy. They are essentially small blood vessels that show through the surface of the skin and appear to be fine red or purple lines \u2014 they\u2019re also sometimes referred to as spider veins.\n\n\u201cMany patients tell us they feel self-conscious wearing a bikini or crop top if they have thread veins in this area \u2014 which usually appear in a \u2018belt\u2019 of tiny, vertical red lines,\u201d Finigan said. \u201cInterestingly, the patients we have treated for this area over the last 12 months have been getting younger, with the majority aged between 20 and 30 years old.\u201d\n\nRemoving thread veins can be accomplished through several different procedures \u2014 such as lasertherapy, sclerotherapy, or a mix of both. In lasertherapy, doctors use laser light to destroy small blood vessels. But veins that are bigger than 4mm need to be removed with sclerotherapy, which involves using a tiny needle to inject a solution that damages cells lining the vein, causing the vein to shrink and disappear over eight weeks. But there\u2019s also a chance that sclerotherapy could cause some complications, like bruising or itching, or a discoloration of the skin. About 10 percent of people experience \u201cmatting\u201d after sclerotherapy, meaning small vessels develop in clusters, but this usually clears up after a while.\n\nIs it possible that older women are less likely to undergo thread vein removal because they're simply less concerned with exposing their midriffs and looking sexy in selfies? \u201cWe do also treat older women up to the age of 40,\u201d Finigan said, \u201cbut patient numbers tend to fall after this age. This could be down to older women preferring not to bare their midriff, or perhaps becoming more body confident as they get older.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "midriff, thread vein removal, sclerotherapy", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "There has been a 20 percent increase in women getting thread veins removed from their midriffs, according to doctors in the UK.", "title": "More Women Are Getting Thread Veins Removed From Midriffs", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/thread-vein-removal-rates-going-women-who-want-their-midriffs-looking-sexy-selfies-300606", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/08/29/midriff.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "There has been a 20 percent increase in women getting thread veins removed from their midriffs, according to doctors in the UK.", "title": "More Women Are Getting Thread Veins Removed From Midriffs", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/thread-vein-removal-rates-going-women-who-want-their-midriffs-looking-sexy-selfies-300606", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/08/29/midriff.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/08/29/midriff.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Healthy Living", "published_time": "2014-08-29T16:44:32-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-08-29T16:44:32-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "There has been a 20 percent increase in women getting thread veins removed from their midriffs, according to doctors in the UK."}, "article_summary": "Is it possible that older women are less likely to undergo thread vein removal because they're simply less concerned with exposing their midriffs and looking sexy in selfies?\nSome women may have a genetic predisposition for thread veins on their stomach, but others develop thread veins from heavy drinking, copious amounts of sun, hormones, and pregnancy.\nThis could be down to older women preferring not to bare their midriff, or perhaps becoming more body confident as they get older.\u201d\n\u201cWe do also treat older women up to the age of 40,\u201d Finigan said, \u201cbut patient numbers tend to fall after this age.\nYou might not be familiar with \u201cthread veins,\" but a good number of women have them."}
