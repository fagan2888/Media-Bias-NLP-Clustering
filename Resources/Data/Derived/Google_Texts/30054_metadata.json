The churches filed suit in October of last year against the state\u2019s Department of Managed Health Care for forcing churches to pay for elective abortions in their health insurance plans.\n\n\u201cThe government shouldn\u2019t be forcing churches to pay for the killing of innocent human life,\u201d Galus explained.\n\n\u201cThese churches have no way to avoid paying for abortions because Obamacare requires health insurance coverage, and the California mandate requires abortion coverage in any health plan. What\u2019s bizarre, though, is that the same government that quite rightfully does not require California churches to pay for contraceptive coverage nonetheless requires them to pay for elective abortion coverage. We trust the court will allow the churches to proceed with challenging this obviously inconsistent and unconstitutional mandate.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo state agency anywhere has the right to demand that church health insurance plans contain coverage for abortion\u2014something that clearly violates these churches\u2019 most sincerely held religious beliefs,\u201d added Stanley. \u201cThat\u2019s why we are asking the court to deny the state\u2019s request to dismiss this lawsuit.\u201d\n\nADF filed the lawsuit, Foothill Church v. Rouillard, in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of California on behalf of Foothill Church in Glendora, Calvary Chapel Chino Hills in Chino, and The Shepherd of the Hills Church in Porter Ranch.\n\nIn 2014, ADF and Life Legal Defense Foundation filed formal complaints with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services against DMHC regarding California\u2019s mandate and its violation of federal conscience law. Those came on the heels of a complaint filed directly with DMHC, which responded by affirming its decision to force all plans to cover all abortions without any explanation as to how that decision squares with the Constitution and contrasting federal law.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"url": "http://www.theglobaldispatch.com/california-mandates-churches-include-abortion-coverage-in-insurance-plans-heads-to-court-95789/", "image": "http://www.theglobaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Jeff-Bridges-RIPD-stop-obamacare-meme.jpg", "type": "website", "title": "California mandates churches include abortion coverage in insurance plans, heads to court"}, "google-translate-customization": "7236b401605984b1-3bcbee0db8307092-g6f41da462829b1d2-19", "msvalidate.01": "F9A11A184D618AB8623122584A1DAB2D", "keywords": "Christian News, Religion News, 2016 Election, Outbreak News, Weird News, Movie News, US News, Breaking News, Internet News, Google News", "google-site-verification": "iI9n62s9s0Z-wJUY9p3-wGZp6AQYcH-Z1tDba2QiaT0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "\u201cThese churches have no way to avoid paying for abortions because Obamacare requires health insurance coverage, and the California mandate requires abortion coverage in any health plan.\nThe churches filed suit in October of last year against the state\u2019s Department of Managed Health Care for forcing churches to pay for elective abortions in their health insurance plans.\nWhat\u2019s bizarre, though, is that the same government that quite rightfully does not require California churches to pay for contraceptive coverage nonetheless requires them to pay for elective abortion coverage.\n\u201cThe government shouldn\u2019t be forcing churches to pay for the killing of innocent human life,\u201d Galus explained.\nWe trust the court will allow the churches to proceed with challenging this obviously inconsistent and unconstitutional mandate.\u201d\u201cNo state agency anywhere has the right to demand that church health insurance plans contain coverage for abortion\u2014something that clearly violates these churches\u2019 most sincerely held religious beliefs,\u201d added Stanley."}
