He even offered to get more of them insured if they worked at least 39 hours a week \u2013 and was shocked when only a handful accepted. Others quit to work at higher-paying part-time jobs. \"To my surprise, having had this program in place for nearly a year,\" Settles told The Post, \"I don't think the staff cares that much\" about health-insurance coverage.\n\nBusinesses care about it, though, especially the cost. Investors' Business Daily has documented over 400 mid- to large-sized employers that will or have already cut worker hours to avoid the full-time classification that will force them to provide health insurance or pay fines for non-compliance. Not all of these are private-sector employers, either.\n\nThe list recently added seven public school districts that intend to cut hours for non-teaching personnel, moves that will save them millions of dollars in benefit costs. The Post also reports a move by French food-service company Sodexo to reclassify 3,000 workers as part time in order to drop their health benefits.\n\nRead MoreObamacare subsidies could hurt at tax time\n\n\n\nEvidence is mounting that the practice has become widespread even among companies that don't announce their intentions. When asked about this rational response to incentives, White House economists suggested watching payroll data to see whether distribution of part-time hours remained steady or shifted as the mandate approached, and last year published a study claiming no effect had been seen.\n\nHowever, the study relied on a method of rounding up that made workers averaging 29.5 hours (which does not qualify as full time for the ACA) to 30 hours (the threshold for full-time designation in the ACA). In reality, the numbers of workers getting 30-34 hours of work a week has dropped 6.4 percent since the end of 2012, while those getting 25-29 hours a week has risen 10.8 percent.", "article_metadata": {"AssetType": "cnbcnewsstory", "description": "The word \"unexpectedly\" for negative economic data has become a much-mocked clich\u00e9, but this week's first-quarter GDP number deserves an exception.
