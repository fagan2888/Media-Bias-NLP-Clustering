He refused to answer questions during two candidate forums last week and subsequent interviews with reporters. On Monday, The Denver Post published what it characterized as an exclusive interview with the candidate about the topic, which Keyser called \u201ca very serious issue.\u201d\n\nToward the beginning of Tuesday evening\u2019s debate, Keyser brought up the controversy himself, saying he wanted to clear the air.\n\n\u201cThe signature issue that I\u2019ve been dealing with is something that I didn\u2019t come out with and speak about right away because I think leaders have to have the courage, the integrity, and the discipline, to make sure that they have all the information that they can gather before they come out and talk about an honest answer,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd here\u2019s the truth: My campaign hired a company, that company hired another company, and that company hired a subcontracted employee that wound up, it looks like, circumventing the law. And that\u2019s wrong.\u201d\n\nThen Keyser turned his attention toward media and coverage of the scandal.\n\n\u201cNow, The Denver Post, I think, has done a good job at covering the story for what it is, but frankly, there\u2019s a lot of media outlets in this state that really have done a lot of the heavy lifting and carried the water for the liberals on this to disguise Michael Bennet\u2019s record and get us talking about anything that doesn\u2019t involve Michael Bennet,\u201d he said.\n\nKeyser continued:\n\nI think there\u2019s a big problem here in the media because there\u2019s a double standard that exists. Frankly, I don\u2019t know of anybody jumping out of the bushes to ask Michael Bennet questions about his vote on Iran or his support of closing Guantanamo Bay and importing the world\u2019s most dangerous terrorists to the United States and probably right here to Colorado. How about his support of Obamacare and the fact that it\u2019s failed.\n\nThe \u201cjumping out of the bushes\u201d line is a newer riff on an earlier Keyser critique about a TV reporter \u201ccreeping around\u201d his house when the reporter knocked on his door to try and get comment for a story.\n\nLater in the debate, Keyser said he thought the petition process to get on the primary ballot in Colorado is \u201cthe most complicated process that we have probably in the country in order to get onto the ballot in the first place.\u201d\n\nIn Colorado there are two ways to get on the ballot. The petition route, which led three of the five Republican candidates to go to court to get on the ballot, allows candidates to bypass the caucus-assembly process. One candidate, El Paso County Commissioner Darryl Glenn, went a different route, earning 70 percent of the vote from thousands of delegates during the GOP state assembly in early April.\n\nIn an interview with The Colorado Independent Tuesday, Glenn said, \u201cEverywhere I go, people will come up to me and tell me that is a factor,\u201d when it comes to who they are voting for this year.\n\n\u201cPeople that made the decision to petition on the ballot, they made a calculated decision early on that wrote off a portion of the base,\u201d he said, adding that with the \u201cTrump phenomenon\u201d this election cycle, people are aggravated.\n\nThe five Republicans running in the primary are Glenn, Keyser, former NFL quarterback Jack Graham, businessman Robert Blaha, and former Aurora City Councilman Ryan Frazier.\n\nFrazier is on the ballot after going to the state Supreme Court because of his petitions, but a judge said if he loses his court challenge he\u2019ll have to withdraw from the race. During Tuesday\u2019s debate he said of the petition process, \u201cThe system is broken, the rules are stuck in the last century, and I\u2019m fighting to make sure every valid voter signature is counted.\u201d\n\nFrazier also went on to say, \u201cThis isn\u2019t a question of whether our campaign can manage a petition or not, these are valid signatures that we\u2019ve reviewed, we\u2019ve found time and again represent valid Republican voters whose signatures were thrown out for clerical or technical errors and, quite frankly, should be counted.\u201d That justices on the state\u2019s highest court took up his challenge, he said, shows that \u201cthey, too, see the errors in the system.\u201d\n\nThe Denver Post sponsored Tuesday\u2019s debate, which was held in the newspaper\u2019s auditorium.\n\n[Photo credit: schmilblick via Creative Commons on Flickr]", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Colorado Independent", "description": "DENVER \u2014 Republican U.S. Senate candidate Jon Keyser lashed out at media organizations during a Tuesday evening debate, accusing reporters of a double standard in coverage of forged signatur...", "title": "Jon Keyser hits media for coverage of his petition problems", "url": "http://www.coloradoindependent.com/159340/keyser-media-signature-petition-responds", "image": "http://coloradoindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/252772357_e5e0115d32_z.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "google-site-verification": "i2NY0iV2fHy9AAYv78ajpH43BN_IO8SUYAgP0XBcpQs", "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://coloradoindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/252772357_e5e0115d32_z.jpg?w=640"}, "site": "@COIndependent", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1", "article": {"published_time": "2016-05-18T01:07:48+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-05-18T04:10:12+00:00", "author": "http://www.coloradoindependent.com/author/corey-hutchins"}}, "article_summary": "Jon Keyser hits media for coverage of his petition problemsDENVER \u2014 Republican U.S. Senate candidate Jon Keyser lashed out at media organizations during a Tuesday evening debate, accusing reporters of a double standard in coverage of forged signatures found on petitions that allowed him on the ballot.\nAnd that\u2019s wrong.\u201dThen Keyser turned his attention toward media and coverage of the scandal.\n\u201cAnd here\u2019s the truth: My campaign hired a company, that company hired another company, and that company hired a subcontracted employee that wound up, it looks like, circumventing the law.\nKeyser continued:I think there\u2019s a big problem here in the media because there\u2019s a double standard that exists.\nOn Monday, The Denver Post published what it characterized as an exclusive interview with the candidate about the topic, which Keyser called \u201ca very serious issue.\u201dToward the beginning of Tuesday evening\u2019s debate, Keyser brought up the controversy himself, saying he wanted to clear the air."}
