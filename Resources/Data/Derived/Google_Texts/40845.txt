[Madison, Wisc...] Gov. Scott Walker announced in his state of the state address last week that he plans to work with newly-elect Attorney General Brad Schimel to prepare a lawsuit against the federal government over the Environmental Protection Agency's carbon emission regulations. The new rules would have detrimental impacts on Wisconsin manufacturing sector, which relies heavily on electricity from coal power plants. If the EPA regulations are implemented mid-summer without changes, Wisconsin will be ready to file a lawsuit.
