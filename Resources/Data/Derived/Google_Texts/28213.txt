Donald Trump rallies his faithful at the IX Center

(Cleveland)-At least three thousand people gathered at the IX Center to listen to Republican presidential frontrunner Donald Trump on Saturday.

There were dozens of protestors as well.

Trump took the stage at 2:00PM to rally his supporters.

Throughout the course of his speech, Trump ordered protesters thrown out of the event.

He lashed out at his presidential rivals, including Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders, blaming them for the protestors at his events and for the violence that forced the cancellation of his rally in Chicago Friday night.

He referred to Florida Senator Marco Rubio as "little Marco" and Texas Senator Ted Cruz as "lyin'Ted", and said that Ohio Governor John Kasich can't win Ohio on Tuesday.

He said that Kasich is weak on trade and immigration, and says the Ohio governor just got "lucky" that oil was struck in Ohio during his administration.

Trump spoke extensively about his plans to deal with trade issues, as well as reiterating plans to build a wall along the Mexican border.

He also said he plans to dismantle the Affordable Care Act, and replace it with something better.

He addressed the heroine epidemic, saying he plans to stem the flow of drugs into this country.

He urged supporters to get out the vote on Tuesday.

An audio recording of the speech is attached.
