Casey will meet with the Broncos on Thursday, according to an NFL source.\n\nCasey, 30, also is scheduled to visit with the Arizona Cardinals this week, according to a Phoenix radio station.\n\nKubiak was the Houston Texans\u2019 coach when he selected Casey from Rice in the fifth round of the 2009 draft. The 6-foot-3, 240-pound Casey played four seasons for Kubiak in Houston, where he was a blocker and special-teams player who occasionally caught a pass.\n\nA free agent in 2013, Casey signed a three-year, $14.6 million deal with Philadelphia. Not bad for a guy who now has 72 career catches and two rushing attempts in six seasons.\n\nIt\u2019s possible the Broncos would use Casey primarily as a fullback and special-teams player. The Broncos have not employed a fullback in recent years, but Kubiak said last week during the NFL scouting combine in Indianapolis that he wants one for his offensive system.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Broncos to meet with free-agent tight end/fullback James Casey", "title": "Broncos to meet with free-agent tight end/fullback James Casey", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/02/23/broncos-to-meet-with-free-agent-tight-endfullback-james-casey/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150223__james-caseyp1-1.jpg", "height": 436}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150223__james-caseyp1-1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-02-23T16:08:24+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-25T23:32:40+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcbf72\"", "article_summary": "The free agent is former Kubiak player James Casey, a tight end and fullback who was released last week by the Philadelphia Eagles.\nIt\u2019s possible the Broncos would use Casey primarily as a fullback and special-teams player.\nThe Broncos will visit with their first free-agent player of the coach Gary Kubiak era.\nCasey will meet with the Broncos on Thursday, according to an NFL source.\nThe 6-foot-3, 240-pound Casey played four seasons for Kubiak in Houston, where he was a blocker and special-teams player who occasionally caught a pass."}
