Charles E. Grassley of Iowa would typically be the one to oversee a rigorous inspection of a potential Supreme Court justice.\n\nBut with the vacancy on the high court created by the death of Antonin Scalia, it is Grassley who finds himself in a political crucible. He is tasked with enforcing Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell\u2019s vow that Scalia\u2019s seat will be left vacant until a new president is sworn in \u2014 and Grassley\u2019s position at the center of a fight that\u2019s polarizing even by Washington standards has invited heightened scrutiny back home over the impasse and a campaign by Democrats pressuring him to break ranks.\n\nGrassley was unmoved after an hourlong sit-down at the White House.\n\n\u201cWhether everybody in the meeting today wanted to admit it, we all know that considering a nomination in the middle of a heated presidential campaign is bad for the nominee, bad for the court, bad for the process and ultimately bad for the nation,\u201d he said.\n\nThe White House and Senate Democrats have singled out Grassley for special attention in part because of comments he made in Iowa recently that they believed showed he might be open to considering a nomination.\n\nOn Monday, Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid said that \u201cthe stakes should even be higher for Sen. Grassley than the other Republican senators,\u201d arguing that his longtime colleague risked tarnishing the reputation of his committee.\n\n\u201cJudiciary chairmen have historically prized their independence and guarded it at all costs from being manhandled for partisan purposes,\u201d Reid said. But with his stance, he argued, Grassley was making the panel \u201can extension of the [Donald] Trump campaign.\u201d\n\nReid, who last week repeatedly highlighted critical coverage of Grassley in Iowa news outlets, spoke beside a poster-size version of an editorial headline from the Hawk Eye newspaper in Burlington, Iowa: \u201cHistory won\u2019t forget this misstep.\u201d\n\nGrassley has been in Washington long enough to recognize the Democrats\u2019 game plan. His aides questioned why President Obama\u2019s initial invitation to discuss the vacancy Tuesday was sent only to their boss and his Democratic counterpart, Sen. Patrick J. Leahy of Vermont. Grassley would attend only if McConnell did as well, a person familiar with the discussions over the meeting said.\n\nIn that meeting, Obama offered Grassley the opportunity to suggest potential nominees he might consider acceptable, one he turned down.\n\n\u201cSen. Grassley and I made it clear that we don't intend to take up a nominee or to have a hearing,\u201d McConnell told reporters after the meeting.\n\nStill, on the right there is some apprehension about whether Grassley, a former pig farmer and the first nonlawyer to lead the committee, might cave under the pressure.\n\nBob Vander Plaats, president of the social conservative advocacy group Family Leader and an influential leader of Iowa evangelicals, said he recently spoke with the senator to encourage him \u201cto stay the course.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe momentum and the enthusiasm is definitely on the Republican side. Sen. Grassley can see that,\u201d Vander Plaats said in an interview. \u201cIf he would go away from a conservative move and say, \u2018I would embrace Obama,\u2019 that would put him at risk.\u201d\n\nBut Grassley has only doubled down on his stance as pressure from the left mounted. After a meeting between McConnell and the Judiciary Committee\u2019s 11 Republican members, Grassley released a letter from them underlining their plan to exercise their \u201cconstitutional authority to withhold consent on any nominee.\u201d\n\nAides say he is guided not by pressure from party leaders or the conservative base but by his own deep-seated belief that the unexpected election-year vacancy offers the country a rare opportunity for a national debate about the role of the Supreme Court.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter how much the minority leader jumps up and down,\u201d Grassley said on the Senate floor. \u201cWe aren't going to let liberals get away with denying the American people an opportunity to be heard.\u201d\n\nTo which White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest responded Tuesday: \u201cWe had that debate in 2012, and that was a debate that the president won.\u201d\n\nThe normally accessible Grassley has increasingly avoided questions about the court fight. Last week, he sought out a reporter to discuss the prospect of Puerto Rican bankruptcy rather than speak to other journalists who would have asked about the White House meeting.\n\nGrassley, 82, entered this final year of his sixth term with a seemingly clear path to a seventh. Only a trio of little-known former Democratic state lawmakers has stepped forward to challenge him. But given the competing forces converging on him, other Democrats are giving it serious thought. Former Iowa Gov. Chet Culver, whose father was unseated by Grassley in 1980, and Culver\u2019s former lieutenant governor, Patty Judge, are said to be considering runs.\n\nGrassley\u2019s reelection campaigns have always employed a two-word slogan: \u201cGrassley works.\u201d But Democrats say his position on the Supreme Court fight risks undercutting his reputation.\n\n\u201cPeople feel like he does his job. Whether you agree with him on the issues or not is another question,\u201d said Andy McGuire, the Iowa Democratic Party chairwoman. \u201cHe does appear to be more vulnerable than he was before, because this is really hitting at the core of he who he is.\u201d\n\nDemocrats know the odds of electoral retribution are long against Grassley even if the court vacancy has taken a toll in Iowa. So much of their rhetoric, as Reid\u2019s showed, has been designed to target Grassley\u2019s sense of institutionalism and defense of Senate prerogatives.\n\nGrassley is unlikely to give in, said David Yepsen, a longtime political reporter for the Des Moines Register who is now director of the Paul Simon Public Policy Institute at Southern Illinois University.\n\n\u201cHe cares a great deal about those traditions. So they are really poking him where it hurts,\u201d Yepsen said. \u201cBut having staked out his position, he\u2019s not going to buckle under this.\u201d\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean the White House won\u2019t continue trying. On Tuesday, the man who once wielded the same committee gavel Grassley now holds also gave him special attention.\n\nAs members of the press corps scrambled to get in position in the Oval Office for a photo op of Tuesday\u2019s meeting, Vice President Joe Biden cautioned a boom mic operator who got too close to Grassley.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t hurt Sen. Grassley,\u201d Biden said. \u201cWe need him.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Supreme Court vacancy makes Sen.
