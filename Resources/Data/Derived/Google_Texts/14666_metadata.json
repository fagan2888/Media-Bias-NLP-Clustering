Terry McAuliffe (D) speaks Thursday in Richmond during an AP Day at the Capitol. (Steve Helber/Associated Press)\n\nGov. Terry McAuliffe (D) announced Thursday that he would trim corporate taxes in his budget plan, a proposal that irked some liberal supporters and seemed designed to corner business-friendly Republicans.\n\nMcAuliffe says reducing the corporate income tax from 6 percent to 5.75 percent would make Virginia more competitive and help lure businesses to the state. During frequent international trade missions, he said, \u201cthe first question we always get is \u2018What is your tax rate?\u2019 \u201d\n\nBut some in the GOP say they expect the governor to pay for the cuts and more tax credits with money that the state would save if McAuliffe was able to expand Medicaid. The Republican-controlled legislature has consistently blocked McAuliffe\u2019s efforts to insure 400,000 Virginians through the Affordable Care Act, which he says would save the state about $353 million over two years.\n\nThe latest strategy could put Republicans in the awkward spot of sacrificing a corporate goody in order to keep Medicaid expansion at bay.\n\nMcAuliffe declined to say how he would pay for the tax cuts or whether he would embed the potential Medicaid savings into the two-year budget proposal he will unveil Dec. 17.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be honest with you: I don\u2019t want to answer your question today because . . . the news today is what I\u2019m proposing here today on tax issues,\u201d he said during a forum hosted by the Associated Press and the Richmond Times-Dispatch.\n\nThe Virginia Chamber of Commerce applauded McAuliffe\u2019s tax cut plan while the liberal-leaning Progress Virginia and the Commonwealth Institute called it a misplaced priority.\n\nDel. S. Chris Jones (R-Suffolk), who chairs the House Appropriations Committee, warned McAuliffe against incorporating Medicaid into the budget but reserved judgment on the tax cut.\n\n\u201cEverything within the budget is a puzzle piece, and until we have all the pieces there is not much to say,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cHowever, it would be unwise for the governor to predicate new spending or initiatives based on so-called savings from Medicaid expansion.\u201d\n\nRepublicans have consistently stymied McAuliffe\u2019s efforts to expand the federal health-care program for the disabled and poor since he took office almost two years ago. But the state\u2019s hospitals association this week gave him a potential new path to expansion without using state dollars.\n\nThe Virginia Hospital & Healthcare Association reversed its long-standing aversion to new fees that could be used to draw down a federal match. That money would create a pool of funding that could be used to insure more Virginians.\n\n\u201cArriving at this moment did not come easily,\u201d VHHA President Sean T. Connaughton said in a letter to McAuliffe. Hospitals throughout the commonwealth and especially in rural areas have complained of a financial crunch exacerbated by their mandate to provide free or reduced-price care to indigent patients.\n\n[Va. hospitals do about-face, giving McAuliffe Medicaid bargaining chip]\n\nYet depending on hospitals to finance Medicaid expansion appears to be a non-starter in the General Assembly.\n\n\u201cThe skyrocketing cost of the current program, concerns over fraud and abuse, and the need for reforms to improve access for patients all argue against expansion,\u201d House Speaker William J. Howell (R-Stafford) said. \u201cThe House understands that Obamacare has put immense pressure on hospitals, but doubling down on Obamacare\u2019s Medicaid expansion is not the solution.\u201d\n\nMcAuliffe said going that route was one option he would explore.\n\n\u201cThere are very creative ways of how we can administer this so we don\u2019t have to incur any state dollars at all,\u201d he said.\n\nAsked whether he has already contacted the federal government about securing special permission to set up such a program, McAuliffe touted his vast network built over decades of fundraising at the highest levels of national politics.\n\n\u201cI am in constant communication with most of the federal cabinet secretaries on a variety of different issues,\u201d he said.\n\nHis budget will also seek to reduce by half the use of an accounting trick known as accelerated sales-tax collections. Highly unpopular with retailers, it requires certain merchants to prepay a portion of their July sales-tax remittance one month early.\n\nIn addition, he will call for a $15 million tax credit for companies spending more than $5 million on research and development, and a bigger tax credit for affluent individuals who provide capital for start-ups, known as angel investors. But the $64 million corporate tax cut could have the most lasting effect on the state\u2019s economy.\n\nDel. C. Todd Gilbert (R-Shenandoah) said he would oppose the tax cuts if they were \u201ctied to [McAuliffe\u2019s] unrelenting single-mindedness on this issue that\u2019s proving across the country to be a bad move.\u201d\n\nBut the governor\u2019s spending plan is widely expected to use Medicaid expansion to indirectly bankroll more teachers and other items popular with the Democratic base.\n\nHis strategy of rolling out the tax plan ahead of the full document created an odd dynamic, with Republicans afraid to speak in favor of cuts that might be linked to Medicaid expansion and liberal Democrats upset by what they perceived as corporate welfare.\n\n\u201cCutting taxes for corporations at the same time that we are laying off school staff and raising college tuition is not the way to build a strong middle class and a prosperous economy for Virginia,\u201d said Michael Cassidy, president of the Commonwealth Institute. \u201cThis is a tax break for wealthy business owners and big profitable corporations.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The budget plan could put business-friendly Republicans in an awkward spot on Medicaid expansion.", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/laura.vozzella", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "The budget plan could put business-friendly Republicans in an awkward spot on Medicaid expansion.", "title": "McAuliffe proposes cutting Va. corporate income tax", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/virginia-politics/mcauliffe-proposes-slashing-va-corporate-income-tax/2015/12/03/564dbc46-99e7-11e5-b499-76cbec161973_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2015/12/03/Local-Politics/Images/McAuliffe-01b93-619.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@LVozzella"}, "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "vapolitics, Terry McAuliffe, bed tax, Medicaid", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/laura.vozzella"}, "eomportal-uuid": "564dbc46-99e7-11e5-b499-76cbec161973", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "vapolitics, Terry McAuliffe, bed tax, Medicaid"}, "article_summary": "But the $64 million corporate tax cut could have the most lasting effect on the state\u2019s economy.\n[Va. hospitals do about-face, giving McAuliffe Medicaid bargaining chip]Yet depending on hospitals to finance Medicaid expansion appears to be a non-starter in the General Assembly.\nMcAuliffe says reducing the corporate income tax from 6 percent to 5.75 percent would make Virginia more competitive and help lure businesses to the state.\nThe latest strategy could put Republicans in the awkward spot of sacrificing a corporate goody in order to keep Medicaid expansion at bay.\nTerry McAuliffe (D) announced Thursday that he would trim corporate taxes in his budget plan, a proposal that irked some liberal supporters and seemed designed to corner business-friendly Republicans."}
