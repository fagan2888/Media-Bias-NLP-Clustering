Identify groups that seemed more likely to engage in political activity \u2013 and give them extra scrutiny.\n\nRelated: IRS Head Defends Destruction of Lois Lerner\u2019s hard Drive\n\nLevin found that an earlier investigation by the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration (TIGTA) was flawed. It gave the impression, he suggested, that the targeting was politically motivated when there was ample evidence to suggest that both liberal and conservative groups were targeted.\n\n\u201cAfter reviewing nearly 800,000 pages of documents and conducting nearly two dozen IRS and TIGTA employee interviews, the investigation found that the IRS used inappropriate selection criteria, burdensome questions, and lengthy delays in processing applications for 501 (c)(4) tax exempt status from both conservative and liberal groups,\u201d said Levin.\n\nThe findings TIGTA released in its own audit were distorted to make the IRS look hostile to conservative organizations, the Levin report said.\n\nRelated: Did IRS Violate the Law on Lerner\u2019s Emails?\n\n\u201cBy focusing exclusively on how the IRS handled \u2026 applications filed by conservative groups and excluding any comparative data on applications filed by liberal groups, the TIGTA audit produced distorted audit results that continue to be misinterpreted,\u201d the report reads.\n\nFor example, the report finds \u201cwhile the TIGTA report criticized the IRS for using \u2018Tea Party,\u2019 \u20189/12,\u2019 and \u2018Patriot\u2019 to identify applications filed by conservative groups, it left out that the IRS also used \u2018Progressive,\u2019 \u2018ACORN,\u2019 \u2018Emerge,\u2019 and \u2018Occupy\u2019 to identify applications filed by liberal groups. While the TIGTA report criticized the IRS for subjecting conservative groups to delays, burdensome questions, and mismanagement, it failed to disclose that the IRS subjected liberal groups to the same treatment.\u201d\n\nThe result, says the report, was that TIGTA \u201cinaccurately and unfairly damaged public confidence in the impartiality of the IRS.\u201d\n\nUnfortunately, there are likely to be questions raised about the impartiality of the Levin report as well: The committee\u2019s Republicans all refused to sign off on it, submitting instead a 37-page dissent that called the assertion that there was no political bias \u201csimply untrue.\u201d\n\nRelated: IRS Loses Lerner\u2019s Emails, Capping Obama\u2019s Awful Week\n\n\u201cThe IRS screening resulted in a clearly disparate impact on conservative group applications,\u201d the dissent reads. \u201cOf the groups applying for tax-exempt status that were pulled from normal processing and received additional scrutiny by the IRS, 83 percent (or 248 out of 298) of the groups were \u2018right leaning\u2019 organizations.\n\n\u201cThe majority\u2019s interpretation of the evidence fails to capture the extent of the IRS\u2019s bias against conservative groups and flagrant abuse of power,\u201d McCain said in a statement released to the press. \u201cOur tax system should not \u2013 and cannot \u2013 be used as a weapon to target political opponents, as the IRS has clearly done, especially when that agency is, at times, tasked with administering laws that involve political free speech. This troubling scandal raises serious concern about the integrity of our nation\u2019s tax collectors and requires further investigation as damaging facts continue to come to light.\u201d\n\nThe IRS scandal, having been a powerful issue for mobilizing conservatives over the past year, will hardly disappear from the political radar with midterm elections coming up and presidential candidates already preparing for 2016. Levin may have hoped to make the issue go away with a comprehensive report on the subject \u2013 but as long as Republicans have any power in Congress at all, McCain\u2019s hope for \u201cfurther investigations\u201d is the one likely to be realized.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "A Senate investigative report says the IRS unfairly targeted both conservative and liberal groups \u2013 but Republicans disagree.", "title": "Why the IRS Targeting Scandal Will Only Gain Steam", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/09/05/Why-IRS-Targeting-Scandal-Will-Only-Gain-Steam", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/03272013_IRS_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/09/05/Why-IRS-Targeting-Scandal-Will-Only-Gain-Steam", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/03272013_IRS_article.jpg", "creator": "@rrgarver", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "A Senate investigative report says the IRS unfairly targeted both conservative and liberal groups \u2013 but Republicans disagree.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "It gave the impression, he suggested, that the targeting was politically motivated when there was ample evidence to suggest that both liberal and conservative groups were targeted.\nThe findings TIGTA released in its own audit were distorted to make the IRS look hostile to conservative organizations, the Levin report said.\nRelated: IRS Head Defends Destruction of Lois Lerner\u2019s hard DriveLevin found that an earlier investigation by the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration (TIGTA) was flawed.\n\u201cThe majority\u2019s interpretation of the evidence fails to capture the extent of the IRS\u2019s bias against conservative groups and flagrant abuse of power,\u201d McCain said in a statement released to the press.\nIdentify groups that seemed more likely to engage in political activity \u2013 and give them extra scrutiny."}
