All in 360 square feet or less.\n\nIt\u2019s micro-living in the nation\u2019s biggest city, and New Yorkers could be seeing more of it. Planning officials are proposing to end a limit on how small apartments can be, opening the door for more \u201cmicro-apartments\u201d that advocates see as affordable adaptations to a growing population of single people. Critics fear a turn back toward the city\u2019s tenement past and question whether less space will really mean less expensive.\n\nAt Carmel Place, the Manhattan building that marks the city\u2019s first experiment in decades with building super-small dwellings, the pitch is that little can be just enough.\n\n\u201cAn efficiently designed micro-unit,\u201d says developer Tobias Oriwol, \u201cis just a nice apartment.\u201d\n\nDue to open early next year, Carmel Place features 55 apartments ranging from 265 to 360 square feet. By comparison, a typical one-car garage can be about 200 square feet.\n\nAs an experimental project, Carmel Place got city land and a waiver from New York\u2019s 400-square-foot minimum on new apartments, set in 1987. A proposed elimination of that minimum would allow smaller studios in buildings with a mix of apartment sizes, but entire micro-unit buildings would continue to need waivers.\n\n\u201cFor us, it was really important to demonstrate how small space could be an enhancement to quality of life,\u201d said Christopher Bledsoe of Stage 3 Properties, which designed the interiors and amenities at Carmel Place.\n\nLong, flat walls without columns maximize furniture-arranging options, although some units come furnished with fold-out wizardry, including a desk that expands into a 12-seater table and a retractable bed that pulls down tidily over a love seat. Developer Monadnock Construction and architecture firm nArchitects worked inch-by-inch \u2014 sometimes by eighth-inch \u2014 to meet such requirements as a wheelchair-accessible bathroom within the small space.\n\nForty percent of the units have rents set by affordable-housing programs topping out at around $1,500 a month, but market-rate ones rent for $2,650 to $3,150, roughly on par with many studios in the nearby Murray Hill neighborhood. About 20 people have applied and hundreds requested information for eight market-rate units so far, while over 60,000 have entered a lottery for the affordable ones.", "article_metadata": {"description": "NYC may fit more \u2018micro\u2019 apartments into housing picture", "title": "NYC may fit more \u2018micro\u2019 apartments into housing picture", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "NYC may fit more \u2018micro\u2019 apartments into housing picture", "title": "NYC may fit more \u2018micro\u2019 apartments into housing picture", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/12/28/nyc_may_fit_more_micro_apartments_into_housing_picture/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/12/nycs-micro-apartments.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "NYC may fit more \u2018micro\u2019 apartments into housing picture", "title": "NYC may fit more \u2018micro\u2019 apartments into housing picture", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/12/nycs-micro-apartments.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Jennifer Peltz", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "As an experimental project, Carmel Place got city land and a waiver from New York\u2019s 400-square-foot minimum on new apartments, set in 1987.\nDeveloper Monadnock Construction and architecture firm nArchitects worked inch-by-inch \u2014 sometimes by eighth-inch \u2014 to meet such requirements as a wheelchair-accessible bathroom within the small space.\nPlanning officials are proposing to end a limit on how small apartments can be, opening the door for more \u201cmicro-apartments\u201d that advocates see as affordable adaptations to a growing population of single people.\nAt Carmel Place, the Manhattan building that marks the city\u2019s first experiment in decades with building super-small dwellings, the pitch is that little can be just enough.\nTopics: From the Wires, NewsNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 The apartments in a new Manhattan building boast little balconies, tall ceilings, dishwashers and storage space."}
