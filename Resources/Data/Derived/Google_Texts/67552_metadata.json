Prayuth Chan-ocha vowed to end Thailand\u2019s decade of political upheaval once and for all. In his words, \u201cto bring everything out in the open and fix it.\u201d\n\nOne year later, the military can boast that it has restored stability and kept this Southeast Asian nation calm. But the bitter societal fissures that helped trigger the putsch are still simmering below the surface, unresolved.\n\n\u201cOur differences have just been pushed under the rug by a junta that prohibits freedom of expression,\u201d said Sunai Phasuk, a senior researcher for Human Rights Watch. \u201cNothing has been done to address the root causes of Thailand\u2019s deep divide.\u201d\n\nWhat is happening now is the imposition of peace by force, Sunai said. \u201cThere\u2019s no guarantee that whenever the junta lets go of their iron grip, the country will not to fall back into conflict,\u201d he added.\n\nOn Friday, the anniversary of the takeover, police quashed a small, peaceful demonstration in Bangkok, triggering scuffles as those who took part were dragged away. At least 37 students were detained before being released Saturday after 11 hours of questioning. Seven others who staged a similar protest in the northeastern city of Khon Kaen were also freed.\n\nSpeaking to reporters the same day, Prayuth acknowledged that seizing power \u201cwas wrong.\u201d But he nevertheless defended the overthrow of Yingluck Shinawatra\u2019s government, saying \u201cwe cannot fix the past, but we can build for the future.\u201d\n\nThe problem, critics argue, is that the junta may be sowing the seeds of more conflict by building that future on its own terms \u2014 with reform committees, a rubber-stamp legislature and no input from the party it toppled, Pheu Thai, whose supporters likely still represent a majority of the electorate.\n\nThe latest point of contention, a constitutional draft released in April, has been criticized even by groups who supported the putsch. If approved, the charter would significantly weaken the power of political parties, shifting it to unelected agencies like a proposed \u201cNational Moral Assembly\u201d that would be empowered to investigate politicians for offenses as minor as \u201cimpolite\u201d speech \u2014 ultimately initiating the path to their removal.\n\nThe charter\u2019s drafters say such reforms are designed to check abuse by corrupt politicians, a problem acknowledged by all sides. But Pheu Thai officials say the real aim is to prevent their party from governing effectively if it wins again.\n\n\u201cNobody knows how these agencies would be made accountable themselves,\u201d said Democrat Party leader Abhisit Vejjajiva, a former premier who was among those who called for Yingluck to resign as prime minister before the coup. Speaking of the junta, he added: \u201cThey should be more concerned with making elected governments more accountable, rather than making them weaker.\u201d\n\nLast week, the military government announced it would subject the draft charter to a referendum. But \u201cif you vote yes, you end up with a Frankenstein constitution that undercuts liberal democracy,\u201d Human Rights Watch\u2019s Sunai said. \u201cIf you vote no, they\u2019ll have to go back to the drawing board, and Prayuth will just stay in power longer.\u201d\n\nThe junta has spoken of holding nationwide elections in late 2016, but no date has been set and some believe it could govern for years.\n\n\u201cThe big picture for now is, we\u2019re still in a lockdown \u2026 there\u2019s still a huge question mark over the future,\u201d said Thitinan Pongsudhirak, a political science professor at Bangkok\u2019s Chulalongkorn University.\n\nThe junta has not been helped by Thailand\u2019s sputtering economy, which has largely remained flat since the coup, with exports and investment down. Thitinan said generals \u201cwere not meant to govern Thailand, (and) some have lost their way. They\u2019re not used to accountability, or being in the public eye, being asked questions.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Year-old Thai coup imposes superficial calm but little else", "title": "Year-old Thai coup imposes superficial calm but little else", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Year-old Thai coup imposes superficial calm but little else", "title": "Year-old Thai coup imposes superficial calm but little else", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/05/23/year_old_thai_coup_imposes_superficial_calm_but_little_else/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/05/thailand.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Year-old Thai coup imposes superficial calm but little else", "title": "Year-old Thai coup imposes superficial calm but little else", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/05/thailand.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Todd Pitman", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "The junta has not been helped by Thailand\u2019s sputtering economy, which has largely remained flat since the coup, with exports and investment down.\nBut Pheu Thai officials say the real aim is to prevent their party from governing effectively if it wins again.\nBut \u201cif you vote yes, you end up with a Frankenstein constitution that undercuts liberal democracy,\u201d Human Rights Watch\u2019s Sunai said.\nBut the bitter societal fissures that helped trigger the putsch are still simmering below the surface, unresolved.\nThe charter\u2019s drafters say such reforms are designed to check abuse by corrupt politicians, a problem acknowledged by all sides."}
