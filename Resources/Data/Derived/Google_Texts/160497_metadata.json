This was in addition to the alleged $20 million it paid for its involvement in the Oscars.\n\nIf this had been a scripted, scheduled ad, such money would have barely covered the travel expenses of Ellen herself, Brad Pitt, Bradley Cooper, Jennifer Lawrence, and all the other stars who mugged for Samsung.\n\nThe president is currently enduring a tense relationship with the millennial community whose money he so needs by March 31.\n\nThe NSA's attempts at being as efficient as Google in screening every piece of communication seems to have rattled some, who feel it's taking the government's commitment to transparency a little too far.\n\nStill, the president used the Ellen opportunity to get moms to persuade their kids to sign up for Obamacare.\n\nHe said that kids in their first or second jobs might not get health insurance given to them by employers, so this was an ideal opportunity to sign up.\n\nHe insisted that the Healthcare.gov Web site \"now works the way it's supposed to.\" As opposed to the way a 1990s car dealer Web site was supposed to.\n\nFive million people have signed up. I wonder how many would have signed up if the site had worked at the beginning and all the stars in Ellen's selfie had shilled relentlessly for the cause. (Oddly, many are now doing so in this final push.)\n\nSelling. It's a dirty business. That's why having some stars on your side helps.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The president, on a whirlwind Obamacare sales trip, ribs Ellen DeGeneres about her star-filled shill -- which broke his retweet record.", "google-site-verification": "wNWLoFvk5wsdZQ-u75uCNiaHNa7FLFmNtH2t7dZbXmQ", "og": {"site_name": "CNET", "description": "The president, on a whirlwind Obamacare sales trip, ribs Ellen DeGeneres about her star-filled shill -- which broke his retweet record.", "title": "Obama to Ellen: Your Samsung selfie was a pretty cheap stunt", "url": "http://www.cnet.com/news/obama-to-ellen-your-samsung-selfie-was-a-pretty-cheap-stunt/", "image": "https://cnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/03/05/377a81e9-b0b5-11e3-a24e-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/670x503/1707072d12d48875ccde60d7ea8549fa/ellen.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The president, on a whirlwind Obamacare sales trip, ribs Ellen DeGeneres about her star-filled shill -- which broke his retweet record.", "title": "Obama to Ellen: Your Samsung selfie was a pretty cheap stunt", "url": "http://www.cnet.com/news/obama-to-ellen-your-samsung-selfie-was-a-pretty-cheap-stunt/", "image": {"width": 670, "identifier": "https://cnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/03/05/377a81e9-b0b5-11e3-a24e-d4ae52e62bcc/thumbnail/670x503/1707072d12d48875ccde60d7ea8549fa/ellen.jpg", "height": 503}, "creator": "@ChrisMatyszczyk", "site": "@CNET", "card": "summary", "account_id": 30261067}, "al": {"ios": {"url": "http://www.cnet.com/news/obama-to-ellen-your-samsung-selfie-was-a-pretty-cheap-stunt/?search=toapp", "app_name": "CNET", "app_store_id": 383989837}}, "tp": {"baseUrl": "https://cnet2.cbsistatic.com/fly/bundles/cnetmpxpdk/pdk"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "Product reviews and prices, software downloads, and tech news - CNET", "p": {"domain_verify": "47524839a64b83c951afca9ef6c838e0"}, "fb": {"admins": 100001036810388, "app_id": 16995676698}, "msapplication-window": "width=1024;height=768", "viewport": "width=device-width", "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.cnet.com/", "fragment": "!", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/cnet"}, "msapplication-navbutton-color": "#424244", "msapplication-task": "name=Forums; action-uri=http://forums.cnet.com/; icon-uri=http://www.cnet.com/favicon.ico"}, "article_summary": "The Ellen Show/YouTube screenshot by Chris Matyszczyk/CNETPresident Obama and Ellen DeGeneres have both been recently promoted to sales associate.\nEllen, on the other hand, turned presenting the Oscars into the opening of a Samsung store.\nHe insisted that the Healthcare.gov Web site \"now works the way it's supposed to.\"\n\"I thought it was a pretty cheap stunt myself,\" mused the president.\nAs opposed to the way a 1990s car dealer Web site was supposed to."}
