But a new study scientifically proves it can improve creativity and mood. Thomas Hawk/CC BY-NC 2.0\n\nDaydreaming, mind wandering, what have you: it\u2019s all beneficial, according to a new study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.\n\nScientists from Bar-Illan University in Israel treated participants with transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), \u201ca non-invasive and painless procedure using low-level electricity to stimulate specific brain regions.\u201d As they received tCDS, participants were asked to both track and respond to flashing numerals on a computer screen, as well as measure their spontaneous thoughts on a scale of one to four.\n\nThe tCDS was focused on the brain\u2019s frontal lobes, because this particular region has been associated with mind wandering before, Moshe Bar, director of the Gonda Multidisciplinary Brain Research Center, said in a press release. Bar added the frontal lobes are central to our cognitive control, allowing us to organize and plan for the future.\n\nAnd for comparision, Bar and his team used the treatment to stimulate the occipital cortex, the brain\u2019s visual processing center, while some participants weren\u2019t treated at all. The results showed mind wandering was unchanged when applied to the occipital cortex or not applied at all; it significantly increased, however, when applied to the frontal lobes.\n\n\u201cOur results go beyond what was achieved in earlier, fMRI-based studies,\u201d Bar said. \u201cThey demonstrate that the frontal lobes play a causal role in the production of mind wandering behavior.\u201d\n\nMore importantly, instances of mind wandering didn\u2019t harm a participant\u2019s ability to complete their tasks \u2014 it actually helped. Bar added this may stem from a sort-of cross-fire of \u201cthought controlling\u201d and \u201cthought freeing\u201d mechanisms in a single brain region.\n\n\u201cOver the last 15 or 20 years, scientists have shown that \u2013 unlike the localized neural activity associated with specific tasks \u2013 mind wandering involves the activation of a gigantic default network involving many parts of the brain,\u201d he said. \u201cThis cross-brain involvement may be involved in behavioral outcomes such as creativity and mood, and may also contribute to the ability to stay successfully on-task while the mind goes off on its merry mental way.\u201d\n\nFrom here, Bar would like to explore further how external stimulation may affect other cognitive behaviors, such as multitasking. Though in the meantime, his fellow neuroscientists could use these findings to shed some light on the behavior of people suffering from low or abnormal neural activity.\n\nSource: Axelrod V, Rees G, Lavidor M, Bar M.
