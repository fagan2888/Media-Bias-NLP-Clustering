A Colorado version of MTV Cribs takes a sneak peak into the homes of three Republican gubernatorial candidates, providing some awesome behind-the-scenes scenes.

The footage includes: Secretary of State Scott Gessler playing a duet with his young daughter; former Congressman Tom Tancredo showing off his dog’s “feng shui” water bowl; and former Senate Minority Leader Mike Kopp making Irish stew at his farmhouse in the city where he and the family raise chickens and bees.

Democratic Gov. John Hickenlooper didn’t respond to reGENERATION Colorado’s request to participate, although there is a shot of the mansion. The campaign for former Congressman Bob Beauprez, another Republican running for governor declined to participate.

ReGENERATION Colorado is a nonprofit aimed at engaging young people to talk about opportunity and polices that impact Coloradans in their 20s and 30s.

“It’s not surprising that the next generation is totally turned off by politics when all they see of politicians is sound-bites in the media,” said Michelle Lyng, executive director of reGENERATION colorado. “Our hope is that if we can make candidates from all parties more relatable, we can engage the next generation of Coloradans into public debate.”
