A redesigned Beth Israel, even one that is smaller, could conceivably meet the health care needs of communities including the Lower East side, which is already known as bedpan alley. However, too drastic a change, or one that sparks unrest among union employees, could prompt the administration to oppose it.\n\nBeth Israel, an 856-bed hospital that has been located on the East Side for more than 125 years, is one of the several hospitals Mount Sinai inherited in 2013 when it purchased Continuum Health Services, which also owned LICH before selling it to SUNY.\n\nThe deal provided Sinai with a couple of hundred primary care physicians, thousands of new patients and much needed physical space as Mount Sinai had outgrown its own campus.\n\nBut it also provided hundreds of hospital beds in an era when health systems in New York City and across the country are chasing ambulatory care dollars.\n\nThe aging infrastructure is proving costly.\n\nBeth Israel\u2019s financial struggles were outlined in a recent Standard & Poor\u2019s report, which revised Mount Sinai\u2019s outlook to negative and said, \u201cwhile performance of the flagship [Mount Sinai Hospital] has been maintained, performance at BI has been particularly weak.\u201d\n\nIn 2014, Beth Israel Medical Center, which includes its Brooklyn campus and other smaller affiliates, posted an operating loss of $90.7 million, largely due to a substantial decrease in revenue from the prior year. That\u2019s the kind of loss that can hurt the bottom line of an entire system.\n\nAsked if he had a timeline for when he\u2019d like to see the rebuilding project completed, Davis laughed slightly and said, \u201cMy timeline is yesterday.\u201d\n\nMount Sinai also runs several outpatient centers in downtown Manhattan and on the East Side, and the future of Beth Israel will have to take those into account.\n\n\u201cWhen you take a look at that ring of facilities, we have to figure out how to use them best to integrate the services,\u201d Davis said.\n\nDavis\u2019 position is not unique. Health system executives everywhere are grappling with declining in-patient numbers and shorter lengths of stay. Many, including the city's public hospital system, are seeking to diversify their revenue base, emphasize out-patient care, become less hospital centric and consolidate their services.\n\nBoth the Affordable Care Act and the state's Medicaid reform initiative encourage health systems to admit fewer patients. The U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services and the state's Medicaid director have both declared their desire for more value-based contracts, which will likely hasten the trend away from in-patient beds.\n\nThese economic forces and public pressure help explain why no health system in New York wanted to keep LICH a full-service hospital, and why NYU Langone agreed to keep LICH open only as a freestanding Emergency Room.\n\nIt's why public health experts believe if the state wants to rebuild Brooklyn's Brookdale Hospital it should create a new building that embraces ambulatory care.\n\nMount Sinai is responding to similar pressures.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have all the answers yet,\u201d Davis said. \u201cWe have needs in lots of different places \u2026 What the community doesn\u2019t need is a very old hospital.\u201d\n\n--additional reporting by Azi Paybarah\n\nCORRECTION: The original version of this article said that Beth Israel was located on the Lower East Side. Its location on 16th Street and First Avenue puts it north of the generally accepted boundaries of that neighborhood.
