The night’s first sketch opened in a dystopian New York City, where we learn that although some people blame the destruction of the U.S. on the government shutdown or Obamacare, it was really the 2013 Video Music Awards that crumbled the nation. Cue flashback. We then see Miley Cyrus prepping for the performance, joined by a concerned future version of herself (played by Vanessa Bayer), her performance partner Robin Thicke (played hilariously by Taran Killam — “Hey what’s up kid, you ready to start grabbing at my junk while I half-sing?”) and even, briefly, by Will Smith (played by Jay Pharoah). This sketch was a bit more lively than some of the more stale politically-themed cold opens, and started the episode off on a high note.
