Also, 34 percent of hospitals lost money in fiscal 2014, according to new data released by the Pennsylvania Health Care Cost Containment Council, or PHC4.\n\nOperating expenses outpaced the 3.1 percent growth in revenues, which hit more than $40 billion statewide, the PHC4 found. The average operating and total margins at Pennsylvania hospitals are still up over the last 15 years, hovering at 4.3 percent and 5.7 percent respectively, though down from their peaks in the mid and late 2000s in the range 5 to 7 percent.\n\n[Also: Jefferson Health forms as merger closes]\n\nAt the same time, most hospitals saw a positive three-year average total margin, and the average time a bill remained in accounts receivable decreased by 24 hours to 45 days.\n\n\"While the data shows many Pennsylvania hospitals experienced relatively healthy margins in fiscal year 2014, 34 percent lost money on operations and 28 percent lost money overall,\" said Joe Martin, executive director of PHC4.\n\nAmong the larger health systems, the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center\u2019s hospitals saw an average margin of 2.7 percent, ranging from 9 percent at UPMC Harmot and 8.5 percent at the Magee Women's hospital to negative 4.1 percent at UPMC Mercy, the system\u2019s lone hospital in the red.\n\nUPMC\u2019s chief rival, Highmark Health-owned Allegheny Health Network, saw an average margin of negative 5 percent, driven by losses at the once near-bankrupt West Penn Allegheny hospital. In the second year of Highmark\u2019s ownership, Allegheny Health Network\u2019s operating losses declined to $37 million, after a $402 million loss in 2013 -- Highmark maintains that the system is on the path to sustainability. Across the three regions of western Pennsylvania where AHN and UPMC are the dominant health systems, the average operating margin was 1.5 percent.\n\nIn greater Philadelphia, hospitals saw an average margin of almost 5 percent, although 17 out of 44 hospitals lost money.\n\nThe four hospitals of the University of Pennsylvania Health System posted an average margin of 4.1 percent, with the flagship University Hospital earning a 15 percent, a cool $380 million. The three acute care hospitals of the newly merged Thomas Jefferson and Abington Health System, Jefferson Health, saw an average margin of 2.3 percent, with the large University Hospital earning a 1.15 percent margin, the Abington Memorial Hospital 1.25 percent and the smaller Lansdale facility 4.5 percent.\n\n[Map: See where states stand on the Medicaid expansion]\n\nThe four hospital Main Line Health System had an average margin of 12 percent, while the two hospitals in the Einstein Healthcare Network lost money, an average of negative 1.2 percent. The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia also had a successful year, with a 12 percent margin bringing in net income was $223 million from revenues of $1.8 billion.\n\nStatewide, 35 for-profit acute care hospitals had an average margin of 1.7 percent. Twelve of the hospitals operated by publicly traded corporations made a profit during 2014, while nine hospitals operated at a loss, including Tenet\u2019s Hahnemann teaching hospital in Philadelphia and seven Community Health Systems facilities. LifePoint Health had an average margin of negative 0.9 percent at its four hospitals, thanks to a negative 10 percent margin at Conemaugh Valley Memorial Hospital. Among the privately-held chains, two Prime Healthcare Services-owned suburban hospitals posted losses, along with Barix Clinics of Pennsylvania, Essent Healthcare and Sharon Pennsylvania Hospital Company.\n\nCommercial health insurers contributed 48 percent, or $18.2 billion, of statewide net patient revenue at Pennsylvania hospitals in 2014, while Medicare paid for 34 percent, or $13.2 billion, and Medicaid paid for 13 percent, or $4.9 billion.\n\n\u201cThe continued growth of uncompensated care,\u201d now at 2.8 percent of net patient revenues, \u201cremains a major concern for Pennsylvania hospitals,\u201d although that phenomenon should be decreasing as Pennsylvania expands eligibility for Medicaid under a new Democratic Governor, said Martin.\n\nHere\u2019s the full list of how Pennsylvania\u2019s hospitals fared in 2014.
