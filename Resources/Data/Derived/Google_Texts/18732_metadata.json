(AP) - Captivated by math, Dylan Johnson spent nearly every spare moment as a teenager immersing himself in numbers - the patterns they can reveal, the problems they can unlock and, especially, what they can forecast.\n\n\u201cI definitely had a strong interest in the stock market because it is so complicated, so difficult to beat,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not like playing chess. It\u2019s a lot more complicated than that, a lot more variables. You have more market participants every day. Trying to determine what they\u2019re going to do and being able to be on the right side of that is a very satisfying idea.\u201d\n\nHe started reading everything he could in the field of finance and alternative financial analytic techniques. By age 19, he was deeply into quantitative analytics, which he said he found to be the most objective method.\n\nFour years later, Johnson is a 23-year-old quantitative systems architect and engineer at a startup private equity fund, Sardonyx Capital. His algorithms are the basis of the fund\u2019s quantitative, systematic approach that managers say is on the foremost frontier of money management.\n\nThat frontier is based in Johnstown.\n\n\u201cThis is something only the highest net worth, wealthiest investors have exposure to,\u201d said Brad Roth, the fund\u2019s chief financial officer. \u201cYou don\u2019t get exposure to this unless you\u2019re in New York City, Chicago, Miami or L.A.\u201d\n\nThe fund, which started trading in January with several million dollars in assets under management, applies algorithms Johnson developed to implement a math-based strategy to maximize profit and minimize risk, according to its five founding principals, including Johnson.\n\n\u201cIn a nutshell, most people who manage money do so through traditional means of finance investing,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cWhat we do is use complete, straight mathematics. We use statistical physics and probability analysis to manage money in real time.\u201d\n\nThe series of equations Johnson built make up two algorithms that not only identify entries and exits but also manage risk, he said. Money management and decision-making are completely automated.\n\n\u201cThere is zero human error,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have a crystal ball, but we do know that when certain equations come to fruition, we have a reasonable expectancy using probability analysis to determine what the best, most-profitable position would be.\u201d\n\nA directional momentum system employs statistical physics to track movement. Unlike some competitors, the Sardonyx system has no optimization, a function that adjusts components inside equations based on past performance.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t change any of our functions,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cThey stay static. Our system is a specific form, very mechanical, very simple and robust with risk management. It\u2019s very risk-averse.\u201d\n\n\u2018He read books \u2026\u2019\n\nThough he doesn\u2019t fish, Johnson, who grew up near the Quemahoning Reservoir, said he could create a grid of the body of water and measure the momentum of the fish to create a formula to predict the best spot for anglers.\n\nIt was that confidence in the ability to bypass chance or gut feelings that kept him pushing for more answers as a teen.\n\n\u201cYou know you can do it because of math, not because you were just lucky,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s definitely not like \u2018Wolf of Wall Street.\u2019 It\u2019s, by far, much more dependable.\u201d\n\nHis father, David Johnson, dabbles in the stock market and was among the first to steer the young man in that direction.\n\n\u201cI tried to explain to him some of the factors going into what you do to pick stocks,\u201d David Johnson said. \u201cHe pretty much just took an interest in it. As he decided that\u2019s what he wanted to do, he started to delve into it as a young man. He read books and read books and read more books.\u201d\n\nThe young man decided early on that he wanted to \u201chang out his own shingle,\u201d his father said.\n\n\u201cHe is very driven, and he won\u2019t take no for an answer,\u201d David Johnson said. \u201cIn his view, it\u2019s not somebody else\u2019s fault if he doesn\u2019t make it. It\u2019s his fault.\u201d\n\nDylan Johnson also relies on faith in God, his father said. He keeps a Bible, a chess board and a full bookshelf at the Sardonyx office.\n\n\u201cHe is a God-fearing young man,\u201d he said. \u201cHe says he owes it all to God.\u201d\n\nAnother of Johnson\u2019s first mentors was Conemaugh Township math teacher Rodney Kendig. He encouraged Johnson at 14 to turn his mathematical talents to finance, a goal he continued to pursue as he studied economics and business at Pitt-Johnstown, even when he was working as a waiter up to 35 hours weekly, his dad said.\n\n\u201cYou would not believe the books he read,\u201d he said. \u201cThey look like technical manuals. He will sit there for hours and devour it and make notations and markings.\u201d\n\nStock market \u2018game\u2019\n\nEventually, Dylan Johnson reached out to Dr. Guo Kai, an assistant professor of economics and finance at the university who shared his interest in statistics.\n\nKai, also a co-founding principal at Sardonyx, took the student\u2019s math and turned it into code.\n\n\u201cHe made the systems come to life,\u201d Johnson said.\n\nKai said he knew the young man was onto something.\n\n\u201cI recognized his capability at solving problems,\u201d he said. \u201cThe stock market is a game, finding how we can beat the system. You identify the weakness or pattern in the game.\n\n\u201cOver time, I became increasingly confident about the system.\u201d\n\nDylan Johnson also reached out to Tyler Trimbath, who had built a reputation for supporting innovation.\n\nTrimbath, 28, has served as a \u201cshark\u201d at Pitt-Johnstown\u2019s entrepreneurial seminar\u2019s \u201cShark Tank\u201d style events. Trimbath saw potential, he said, and worked with his father-in-law and area business leader, Lou Mihalko, as well as 26-year-old Roth, whose background is in the financial services industry and who had connected with Trimbath in the city\u2019s entrepreneurial circles, Trimbath said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very unique how all this lined up,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is an initiative underway in this community to keep individuals like Dylan here, because individuals like Dylan who graduate from a local university or college have the opportunity to go elsewhere.\n\n\u201cHe could have left and made a quarter million dollars after he graduated, easily.\u201d\n\nWhen the young man pitched his idea, Trimbath said he bit for two reasons.\n\n\u201cOne, I want to see all our investors and anybody that believes in this feel this was a successful opportunity for them,\u201d he said. \u201cSecondly, my interest is: How can we help to develop this community with, one, good jobs but also really incredible technology? The fact that this is something that can be housed in Johnstown is extremely interesting to me.\u201d\n\nBuilding the team\n\nMihalko, a local entrepreneur who built Mihalko\u2019s General Contracting into a company with three locations and 50 employees, was intrigued, he said. Mihalko provided real dollars for beta testing of Johnson\u2019s idea.\n\n\u201cI really thought they deserved a chance to excel at something they truly believe in,\u201d Mihalko said. \u201cI\u2019ve dabbled in trading in years past and knew, for myself, that it was way too stressful. This has no stress because it takes it out. It makes decisions. It\u2019s like artificial intelligence, in a way.\u201d\n\nMihalko followed the team\u2019s journey as members sought funding from the area\u2019s trust departments.\n\n\u201cGood minds together, they can just do wonders,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWhat we did was built a team. We raised funding, and we launched this. We feel it will be hugely successful.\u201d\n\nThe math could even be applied to other industries where predicting is key. In Sardonyx\u2019s office along Jaycee Drive in Richland Township, Johnson and the others continue research and development while they watch a computer use their system to track and trade.\n\n\u201cWe want to build real jobs around these great ideas,\u201d Mihalko said, adding that he is encouraged by the drive to innovate that he sees among area graduates.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re really looking for other opportunities to come out of new entrepreneurial program UPJ has put together,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe would love to work with some of those students.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of people in Johnstown looking for opportunities. They have to have business-minded people willing to take a risk sometimes. I think we\u2019re on the right path. There\u2019s no reason why we can\u2019t have some of these great ideas coming out of a little town. We can do it right here in Johnstown.\u201d\n\n___\n\nOnline:\n\nhttp://bit.ly/1FeEoCM\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The Tribune-Democrat, http://www.tribune-democrat.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "Captivated by math, Dylan Johnson spent nearly every spare moment as a teenager immersing himself in numbers - the patterns they can reveal, the problems they can unlock and, especially, what they can forecast.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/feb/28/young-entrepreneur-develops-money-management-progr/", "site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "type": "article", "description": "Captivated by math, Dylan Johnson spent nearly every spare moment as a teenager immersing himself in numbers - the patterns they can reveal, the problems they can unlock and, especially, what they can forecast.", "title": "Young entrepreneur develops money-management program"}, "twitter": {"description": "Captivated by math, Dylan Johnson spent nearly every spare moment as a teenager immersing himself in numbers - the patterns they can reveal, the problems they can unlock and, especially, what they can", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Young entrepreneur develops money-management program"}, "Author": "KECIA BAL", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca6b9\"", "article_summary": "As he decided that\u2019s what he wanted to do, he started to delve into it as a young man.\nUnlike some competitors, the Sardonyx system has no optimization, a function that adjusts components inside equations based on past performance.\nKai said he knew the young man was onto something.\nHe read books and read books and read more books.\u201dThe young man decided early on that he wanted to \u201chang out his own shingle,\u201d his father said.\n\u201cHe is a God-fearing young man,\u201d he said."}
