To the great disappointment of the Romney/Ryan campaign, it didn\u2019t go well\n\nLast week in Michigan, however, Rep. Gary Peters (D), his party\u2019s U.S. Senate candidate, also appeared alongside an empty chair , and his stunt was far more effective. Peters\u2019 point was to highlight the fact that his Republican opponent, former Michigan Secretary of State Terri Lynn Land (R) refuses to accept any debate invitations (thanks to Ron Chusid for the heads-up).\n\n\u201cIf a candidate isn\u2019t willing, when they are running for office, to stand up and say what they are for, if they were elected, they would completely disappear,\u201d Peters told voters.\n\nOrdinarily, when a candidate refuses to debate, it\u2019s because he or she has a sizable lead and doesn\u2019t want to risk it by standing alongside a weaker rival. But in Michigan, Terri Lynn Land is losing \u2013 and she still won\u2019t consider any debate invitations.\n\nJamison Foser flagged this Detroit News column from Laura Berman, who can\u2019t quite figure out Land\u2019s \u201c no-show strategy .\u201d\n\nTerri Lynn Land\u2019s no-show strategy for a U.S. Senate seat is a weird dare to Michigan voters: She\u2019s gambling you won\u2019t notice her near total disappearance from the campaign trail. While both Land and her opponent, U.S. Rep. Gary Peters, are bombarding the airwaves with commercials, it\u2019s Land who\u2019s trying to stay out of sight. Her campaign doesn\u2019t advertise public appearances \u2013 if there are any \u2013 and ignores or postpones interview requests from journalists. Want to see flesh-and-blood Terri? \u201cI\u2019ll let you know if Terri has availability,\u201d her press secretary, Heather Swift, emailed me last week, after repeated requests for an interview or notice of upcoming appearances with the former Michigan Secretary of State.\n\nIt\u2019s one thing to duck debates, but I can\u2019t remember the last time I saw a major-party candidate in a competitive statewide race literally hide from the public.\n\nTo clarify, this is not to suggest Land is quitting. On the contrary, the Republican campaign is still running plenty of campaign ads and, as best as I can tell, still hopes to be elected to the Senate.\n\nThat said, the GOP candidate is taking a non-traditional approach of limiting her interactions with voters, avoiding interviews with journalists, and skipping all the debates.\n\nIt may have contributed to the fact that the Koch brothers\u2019 Freedom Partners officially gave up on the Michigan race last month.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "description": "It's a rare sight: a U.S. Senate candidate who is trying to limit her interactions with voters, avoid interviews with journalists, and skip all the debates.", "original-source": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/terri-lynn-lands-no-show-strategy", "og": {"site_name": "MSNBC", "description": "It's a rare sight: a U.S. Senate candidate who is trying to limit her interactions with voters, avoid interviews with journalists, and skip all the debates.", "title": "Terri Lynn Land's 'no-show strategy'", "url": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/terri-lynn-lands-no-show-strategy", "image": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--1_91-1--1200x630/public/articles/mackinac_conference_senate_race.jpeg-0c06a.jpg?itok=FyyCtwyL", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "msnbc.com", "account_id": 2836421, "title": "Terri Lynn Land's 'no-show strategy'", "url": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/terri-lynn-lands-no-show-strategy", "image": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--3-2--512x342/public/articles/mackinac_conference_senate_race.jpeg-0c06a.jpg?itok=o6jjUoK-", "creator": {"identifier": "@msnbc", "id": 2836421}, "site": {"identifier": "@msnbc", "id": 2836421}, "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "It's a rare sight: a U.S. Senate candidate who is trying to limit her interactions with voters, avoid interviews with journalists, and skip all the debates."}, "robots": "follow, index", "DC.date.issued": "2014-09-15T12:45:00-04:00", "jenga-session-config": "{\"when_to_init\":\"after_dom_ready\"}", "fb": {"app_id": 351594351545594}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/steve.benen"}, "abstract": "It's a rare sight: a U.S. Senate candidate who is trying to limit her interactions with voters, avoid interviews with journalists, and skip all the debates.", "nv": {"author": "steve-benen", "title": "Terri Lynn Land's 'no-show strategy'", "tags": "election-2014,elections,michigan,rachel-maddow-show", "published": 1, "date": "09/15/2014 12:45:00 EDT", "address": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/terri-lynn-lands-no-show-strategy"}, "news_keywords": "Elections, Election 2014, Michigan"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdfc1f\"", "article_summary": "But in Michigan, Terri Lynn Land is losing \u2013 and she still won\u2019t consider any debate invitations.\nJamison Foser flagged this Detroit News column from Laura Berman, who can\u2019t quite figure out Land\u2019s \u201c no-show strategy .\u201dTerri Lynn Land\u2019s no-show strategy for a U.S. Senate seat is a weird dare to Michigan voters: She\u2019s gambling you won\u2019t notice her near total disappearance from the campaign trail.\nPeters\u2019 point was to highlight the fact that his Republican opponent, former Michigan Secretary of State Terri Lynn Land (R) refuses to accept any debate invitations (thanks to Ron Chusid for the heads-up).\nOn the contrary, the Republican campaign is still running plenty of campaign ads and, as best as I can tell, still hopes to be elected to the Senate.\n\u201cI\u2019ll let you know if Terri has availability,\u201d her press secretary, Heather Swift, emailed me last week, after repeated requests for an interview or notice of upcoming appearances with the former Michigan Secretary of State."}
