Haislmaier, a senior research fellow at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank based in Washington, D.C.\n\nPresumptive eligibility itself is nothing new. For years, most states have been caring for pregnant women and youth while their Medicaid or Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program qualifications are ironed out.\n\nBy expanding the number of acceptable categories and giving hospitals more control, the chance for fraud will only escalate, according to Joshua Archambault, a senior fellow for health care at the Foundation for Government Accountability, a nonpartisan, privately funded, research organization in Florida.\n\nPresumptive eligibility doesn\u2019t require the same level of verification as an actual application, which likely could lead to more patients lying about their personal information \u2014 such as income or family size \u2014 to receive care, Archambault said.\n\n\u201cThe Medicaid program has fraud problems and this might make it slightly worse,\u201d he added.\n\nDennis Smith, a former George W. Bush administration Medicaid director and Wisconsin Health and Human Services secretary, also doesn\u2019t understand why Section 2202 is needed because the ACA tries to convince all citizens to be insured.\n\n\u201cPresumptive eligibility goes away if everyone has become insured in the first place,\u201d said Smith, who now is a managing director at McKenna Long & Aldridge LLP in Washington, D.C.\n\nSmith also is concerned about the provision because he said it \u201cgives hospitals, in essence, the keys to the state treasury.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo me, it\u2019s a slippery slope when you give a non-state entity the right to tap into state funds,\u201d Smith added. \u201cI think there\u2019s a fundamental issue at stake.\u201d\n\nSection 2202 also will provide hospitals with more chances to \u201cwork the system\u201d by being authorized to make on-the-spot determinations, according to Tom Miller, a resident fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, a private, nonpartisan, public policy research agency.\n\n\u201cGiven the nature of data keeping and standard anti-fraud enforcement in many state Medicaid programs, a lot goes through the cracks,\u201d Miller said.\n\nBut in Wisconsin, steps are already being taken to protect state taxpayers from being ripped off, according to Department of Health Services spokeswoman Claire Smith.\n\nThe DHS and its Office of the Inspector General, which was created in 2011 by Gov. Scott Walker, will review any instance where there is a suspicion of inappropriate presumptive eligibility submissions, Claire Smith said.\n\n\u201cWisconsin will be holding hospitals accountable to ensure they assist individuals with the completion of the full Medicaid application,\u201d she added. \u201cThe Department of Health Services will do this by establishing standards related to the proportion of individuals determined presumptively eligible through the regular application process.\u201d\n\nThe OIG has collected or avoided nearly $8 million in state public assistance recipient fraud in the first half of 2013, Claire Smith said.\n\nIn 2012, the OIG collected or avoided $12.3 million and had a return of $23 for every dollar invested, she added.\n\nBut the exact toll on taxpayers regarding improper presumptive eligibility cases isn\u2019t known at this time.\n\nThe U.S. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services doesn\u2019t have national records on the amount of public money that is spent on uninsured patients who apply for Medicaid through presumptive eligibility but are later found to be unqualified, according to a source from that office who requested anonymity.\n\nThat is up to each state, the source said.\n\nBut the Wisconsin DHS was unable to readily hand over those numbers when contacted by Wisconsin Reporter.\n\nIt would cost \u201cthousands of dollars\u201d to get those figures because they would have to be pulled from a system that is managed by vendors, Claire Smith said.\n\nSection 2202 becomes effective Jan. 1.\n\nContact Adam Tobias at atobias@watchdog.org or follow him on Twitter at @Scoop_Tobias", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Watchdog.org", "description": "Experts worried that Obamacare provision could lead to more fraud, working the system in Medicaid program", "title": "Obamacare provision could lead to more Medicaid fraud - Watchdog.org", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2013/11/ObamaCareMoney.jpg", "updated_time": "2013-11-06T12:10:23+00:00", "url": "http://watchdog.org/114415/obamacare-think-believe/", "type": "article"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Watchdogorg", "section": "News", "tag": "Affordable Care Act,Claire Smith,Dennis Smith,Heritage Foundation,medicaid,ObamaCare,Pioneer Institute,presumptive eligibility,Scott Walker,Section 2202,Wisconsin Department of Health Services", "published_time": "2013-11-05T04:00:50+00:00", "modified_time": "2013-11-06T12:10:23+00:00"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Watchdog.org", "description": "Experts worried that Obamacare provision could lead to more fraud, working the system in Medicaid program", "title": "Obamacare provision could lead to more Medicaid fraud - Watchdog.org", "image": {"src": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2013/11/ObamaCareMoney.jpg"}, "creator": "@watchdogorg", "site": "@watchdogorg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noarchive", "description": "Experts worried that Obamacare provision could lead to more fraud, working the system in Medicaid program"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1c49\"", "article_summary": "\u201cGiven the nature of data keeping and standard anti-fraud enforcement in many state Medicaid programs, a lot goes through the cracks,\u201d Miller said.\nBut the exact toll on taxpayers regarding improper presumptive eligibility cases isn\u2019t known at this time.\nScott Walker, will review any instance where there is a suspicion of inappropriate presumptive eligibility submissions, Claire Smith said.\nUnder the regulation, hospitals have the authority to use presumptive eligibility to provide temporary care for the uninsured who fall into the Medicaid categories that their respective state already covers, Medicaid spokeswoman Emma Sandoe said.\n\u201cThe Medicaid program has fraud problems and this might make it slightly worse,\u201d he added."}
