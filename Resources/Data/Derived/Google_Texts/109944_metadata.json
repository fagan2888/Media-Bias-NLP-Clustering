I sent emails to Wolf Blitzer and Glenn Beck asking them just how in the world they could\u2019ve said the Libertarian Party was \u201cfringe.\u201d I booed when my classmate mentioned the New Deal in a presentation on \u201cThe Great Gatsby.\u201d When my Ron Paul 2008 sweat shirt went missing on a family vacation, I immediately implicated the CIA in the abduction.\n\nI am not that kid anymore, which bodes well for the continued integrity of my facial structure. My views haven\u2019t changed as much as you might expect; I maintain that centralized government power, whether in the economic or social sphere, results in corruption and abuse more often than not. But when people ask me where I stand ideologically, I cringe at the thought of responding with \u201cfreedom\u201d or \u201climited government,\u201d phrases that I once seemed destined to have tattooed on my forehead. Now, I\u2019m more likely to stammer for a few seconds before coming up with something like, \u201cHey, uh, it\u2019s pretty sunny out there today, no?\u201d\n\nPeople always told me that my staunch libertarianism would erode when I went to college and saw the world through a wider lens. I didn\u2019t believe them, just like I didn\u2019t believe their claims that Ron Paul would fall short of the presidency, but we know how that turned out. Contrary to how the story often goes, there was no professor, classmate or piece of reading that exhorted me toward neoconservatism or Marxism. Instead, it was consorting with my fellow libertarians that drove me away.\n\nMy realization of the libertarian tragedy began, as most tragedies do, with social media. I attended college in Washington, D.C., a place that may not appeal to libertarians as much as it does to mainstream partisans, but still has a fair number of freedom-minded folks who call it home. When I was accepted for study, I connected with my school\u2019s College Libertarians Facebook group. They were a tight-knit bunch, but they embraced my eagerness to join their ranks. Soon, my Facebook feed was filled with all kinds of Ayn Rand quotes and Gadsden flags. Posts like the one claiming that public schools, the very institutions that employed many of my family members, were \u201creplete with agents of state-orchestrated indoctrination\u201d (good job with the SAT words there, guys) were enough to keep me from ever showing up to a College Libertarians meeting.\n\nStill, a few crazy Facebookers weren\u2019t going to douse my political aspirations. I made my way through a revolving door of internships on Capitol Hill and at nonprofits. It was in a congressional office that I became acutely aware of a group of people I call \u201cDiscipauls,\u201d and learned just how troublesome they could be. I want to be clear that a mere Ron Paul supporter is often completely different from a Discipaul. Plenty of people are sympathetic to the anti-establishment former congressman, and with good reason, but few of them reach the Discipauls\u2019 level of kookery. The Discipauls could not go a day without bringing their faxes and phone calls to the interns\u2019 attention. Their messages of \u201cHey, vote for this bill because Ron Paul supports it!\u201d or \u201cAll of the presidential candidates not named Ron Paul are guilty of treason!\u201d were relentless.\n\nSometimes, on rare days when internship-related drudgery hadn\u2019t caused me to glaze over, I would challenge and debate the Discipauls (this was explicitly not to be part of my job description \u2013 oops). There was a consistent lack of constitutional literacy and current events knowledge emanating from their end of the phone line. One lady called me, practically out of breath over the fact that Obamacare would \u201cmandate microchip implantation for all citizens.\u201d When I asked her where she found this information, she referred me to a YouTube video called \u201c666 Mark of the Beast.\u201d The Discipauls\u2019 approach toward gathering information seemed to be \u201cif Ron or someone supporting him says something, take their word for it,\u201d which, interestingly, is the exact opposite of what Paul himself preached about activism on the campaign trail.\n\nOne would think that the craziest Discipauls would be limited to the type of people who had nothing better to do but call their representative on weekday afternoons, but a surprising number of these people showed up in nonprofit offices and at professional networking events. Young and naive as I was, the dogmatism of these libertarians surprised me. One of the reasons I was drawn to the liberty movement in the first place was its purported aversion to dogma. Libertarians rejected the two major-party platforms that Americans are expected to conform to, and instead took the initiative to seek out a more obscure way of thinking. There is a long tradition of skepticism among libertarian thinkers, so it\u2019s maddening to see this skepticism disappear when it comes to Ron Paul and his closest allies. The Discipauls engage in the same unquestioning hero worship that causes them to deride equally enthusiastic Barack Obama supporters as \u201czombies,\u201d or the particularly vomit-inducing \u201csheeple.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "In the right hands, libertarianism could be a middle-of-the-road philosophy.
