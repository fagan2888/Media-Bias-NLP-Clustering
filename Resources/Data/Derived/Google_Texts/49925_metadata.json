Also on Sunday, Donald Trump made a campaign appearance at Madison Academy in Madison, Alabama, an altogether remarkable place with an altogether remarkable history. Somewhere in between, which is to say somewhere in the mountains that run between Tennessee and Alabama, which also is to say somewhere on the undulating landscape where the Confederate States of America was first broken as an actual nation, can be found the state of the presidential campaign, which likely is going to come to something like a climax on Tuesday night.\n\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below\n\nMeharry was named for Samuel Meharry, a luckless 16-year old Scots salt peddler whose wagon slid off a road and into a swamp one rainy night in 1820. A family of freedmen helped him pull his wagon out of the morass and, as the story goes, Meharry promised the family that one day he would do something for \"their race.\" (As has been sadly customary, the name of the black family who helped Sam Meharry was lost to history.) Fifty-six years later, in the aftermath of the Civil War, Meharry and his brothers redeemed Sam's promise, funding the medical department at Central Tennessee College. That department eventually grew into the Meharry Medical College. The Salt Wagon remains a symbol of the college's mission.\n\nHRC arrived at Meharry plainly ready to pivot from the primary season to the general election campaign. \"We all want people to be equal before the law,\" she said. \"We are governed by the rule of law and I want us to know that, to embrace that, and work to make it true for everyone no matter who you are and where you live, regardless of race or ethnic background or anything else\u2026because we are all in this together, no matter what some people who are running for president might say, as they insult one group of us or another group of us. We are all in this together and that is our great promise.\"\n\nIn South Carolina, her rhetoric had more of an edge to it. She traveled the state with the mothers of people killed either by police or in police custody. She spoke with no little heat about the deaths of Trayvon Martin and Eric Garner. Here, at Meharry, her tone was conspicuously more conciliatory. In addition, in her remarks about advancing the progress made by the Affordable Care Act, she made a point of identifying Congressman Jim Cooper, a local lawmaker who has endorsed her candidacy, and folks with memories that reach all the way back to the 1990s will remember Cooper as the most active Blue Dog in the manger when it came to HRC's attempt to reform health-care during her husband's administration. (Cooper played something of a similar role during the congressional debate over the ACA.) His bill did as much to torpedo her attempts at reform as any single action undertaken by any Democratic politician of the time. But time, and frontrunner status, heals all wounds.\n\nIn 1954, the Supreme Court ordered the public schools in the South to desegregate, ending the era in law that had begun with Plessy v. Ferguson. This decision obviously included the public schools in Alabama. Madison Academy, meanwhile, was founded in 1955 as Madison Bible Academy. Whether this was coincidental is entirely open to question. One of the school's graduates is Don Black, a high-ranking official in the current iteration of the Ku Klux Klan, a former organizer and adviser to former Klan leader David Duke, and the creator of the popular white supremacist website, Stormfront. More recently, Madison, Alabama, hit the headlines when one of its police officers paralyzed a 57-year-old Indian man by slamming him to the ground. The officer was fired, but two attempts at trying him for assault both came to naught.\n\nYet Judge Madeline Hughes Haikala threw out the case late Wednesday, saying in a 92-page opinion that federal prosecutors had tried and failed over the course of two trials last year to secure a conviction. While calling what happened a \"tragedy,\" she seemed to suggest Patel was responsible in part for the rough treatment he received, noting in her ruling that Patel committed a misdemeanor by leaving his home without identification, and noting the grandfather should have known some basic English because it was not his first visit to the United States.\n\nAll in all, if you were He, Trump, and you were spending a pleasant Sunday fending off charges that you were (at best) ignorant of who David Duke was, what the Klan was all about, and generally why America's white supremacist community had found your candidacy so attractive, you might have found a place where the, ahem, historical optics might have been a little more conducive to selling that particular brand of persiflage. But He, Trump is not as are other men. Neither is his campaign as are other campaigns. He drew a massive crowd at Madison Academy. The main event at the rally was the announcement that Senator Jefferson Beauregard Sessions had decided to endorse He, Trump, and Sessions himself has a record on race that is, to say the least, curious.\n\nSenate Democrats tracked down a career Justice Department employee named J. Gerald Hebert, who testified, albeit reluctantly, that in a conversation between the two men Sessions had labeled the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) and the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU ) \"un-American\" and \"Communist-inspired.\" Hebert said Sessions had claimed these groups \"forced civil rights down the throats of people.\" In his confirmation hearings, Sessions sealed his own fate by saying such groups could be construed as \"un-American\" when \"they involve themselves in promoting un-American positions\" in foreign policy. Hebert testified that the young lawyer tended to \"pop off\" on such topics regularly, noting that Sessions had called a white civil rights lawyer a \"disgrace to his race\" for litigating voting rights cases. Sessions acknowledged making many of the statements attributed to him but claimed that most of the time he had been joking, saying he was sometimes \"loose with [his] tongue.\" He further admitted to calling the Voting Rights Act of 1965 a \"piece of intrusive legislation,\" a phrase he stood behind even in his confirmation hearings.\n\nHRC may not want it to be this way, and He, Trump may want to pretend that he's not stirring up the forces that make it so, but this presidential campaign already has been racialized in a way that country hasn't seen since the late George Corley Wallace ran for president twice and, in doing so, showed us that, in many tragic ways, the whole country was Southern. (Many of the \"Reagan Democrats\" in the North were Wallace Democrats first, and Thurmond Democrats before that.) There are legitimate concerns about whether or not Trump can control the forces that have fueled his rise, or if he even wants to do that. But there are also legitimate concerns about whether or not Hillary Rodham Clinton now is going to be advised to pivot toward \"the center\" now that she has her nomination pretty well wrapped up. Anyone who is advising her to do that is sadly misinformed. Any strategy designed to make her the \"reasonable\" candidate sadly misreads the state of the country.\n\nThis already is a dirty, nasty campaign because that's what a good portion of the electorate wants it to be. She is going to have to fight, hard, and not necessarily politely, against the worst forces in American history, forces that too many people thought were long dead and buried.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.contenttype": "article", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://esq.h-cdn.co/assets/16/09/160x160/square-1456768980-sessionstrump.jpg", "description": "And Hillary Clinton needs to confront that head-on.\u200b", "title": "Trump Has Unleashed Forces of White Supremacy and Racism that Hillary Clinton Will Need to Confront Directly", "og": {"site_name": "Esquire", "description": "And Hillary Clinton needs to confront that head-on.\u200b", "title": "Donald Trump's White Supremacist Problem Won't Go Away Overnight", "url": "http://www.esquire.com/news-politics/politics/news/a42548/trump-white-supremacy-forces/", "image": {"url": "http://esq.h-cdn.co/assets/16/09/1600x800/landscape-1456768980-sessionstrump.jpg", "width": 1600, "identifier": "http://esq.h-cdn.co/assets/16/09/1600x800/landscape-1456768980-sessionstrump.jpg", "height": 800}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@Esquire", "image": {"src": "http://esq.h-cdn.co/assets/16/09/1456768980-sessionstrump.jpg"}, "description": "And Hillary Clinton needs to confront that head-on.\u200b", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Donald Trump's White Supremacist Problem Won't Go Away Overnight"}, "sailthru.date": "2016-02-29T13:22:22-05:00", "sailthru.socialtitle": "Donald Trump's White Supremacist Problem Won't Go Away Overnight", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1020421151, affiliate-data=pt=305920&ct=OnSiteESQ&mt=8", "fb": {"app_id": 171874009543995, "pages": 84169421673}, "auto-publish": "evergreen", "sailthru.tags": "News & Politics, donald trump,hillary clinton, election 2016,republicans,white supremacists", "google-site-verification": "jc-n3hu5vRQZpMR_8zTdWlZclmVbvCl2qFQ2fxka3rc", "keywords": "donald trump,hillary clinton,election 2016,republicans,white supremacists", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Esquire", "section": "Politics With Charles P.
