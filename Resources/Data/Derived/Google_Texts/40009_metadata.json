It didn\u2019t help that the most popular prescription drugs, Premarin and Prempro, were made using pregnant mare\u2019s urine\u2014hence Premarin. Creepy, right? Soon millions of women had switched to the bioidenticals, for which Somers evangelizes constantly, with seven books on the topic and counting.\n\nBut there\u2019s only one problem: It\u2019s bull.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a catchy phrase, \u2018bioidentical,\u2019 but it doesn\u2019t really mean anything,\u201d says Dr. Nanette Santoro, chair of the department of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of Colorado Medical School. \u201cIt\u2019s a loaded word.\u201d According to the respected blog Science-Based Medicine, \u201c[Bioidentical] is a marketing term rather than a scientifically meaningful one.\u201d\n\nWhat bioidentical means, technically, is that the hormone molecules are chemically the same as those found in the human body. As used by Somers and her adherents, though, it also means that those hormones (not only estrogen, but progesterone and others) are prepared in a special mixture by a \u201ccompounding\u201d pharmacy, which makes custom preparations of drugs and supplements, to a physician's prescription. Compounding pharmacies are basically unregulated, and hormones are technically considered dietary supplements, and are minimally controlled by the FDA. \u201cBioidenticals are a natural substance and cannot be patented,\u201d she writes in Ageless. \u201cTherefore, there is no money to be made from selling the best solution for menopausal women.\u201d\n\nActually, not true: Otherwise the compounding pharmacies would not sell them. \u201cThe markup on this stuff is awesome,\u201d says Santoro. \u201cTo get a crystalline steroid in bulk is very cheap, and to be able to sell it for $200 a month is really a good gig.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s also a myth that \u201cbioidenticals\u201d can only be obtained from one of these unregulated compounding pharmacies; in fact, there are many FDA-approved hormone treatments using hormones identical to our own. \u201cA better distinction could be made between products that are approved and regulated by the FDA, and those that are not,\u201d wrote two noted menopause experts, Drs. Lynn Pattimakiel and Holly Thacker, in the Cleveland Clinic Journal of Medicine in December 2011. Also, the \"bioidenticals\" do not have the scary \"black box\" warning label the FDA requires on all approved hormone-replacement products.\n\nFDA approved means it\u2019s been tested for safety, efficacy, and dosing and absorption; the drug companies have researched, and patented, the various delivery methods (pills, creams, skin patches, even a nasal spray.) And doctors know how much of the hormone their patients are really getting. With compounding, not so much. Last year, contamination at a compounding pharmacy in Framingham, Mass. caused an outbreak of fungal meningitis that killed 48 people and sickened more than 700. An FDA study of compounded drugs found that the actual dosage varied by as much as 280 percent.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had a patient bring in her hair in a baggie because a compounding pharmacy screwed up her testosterone prescription,\u201d says Santoro.\n\nMany experts object to the aggressive way in which Somers advocates using the hormones, cranking her estrogen (and testosterone!) levels up to those of a 30-year-old in her sexual prime. After Ageless came out in 2006, seven prominent OB-Gyns wrote her an open letter\u2014including three of the doctors she had actually quoted in the book\u2014criticizing her for pushing the \u201cWiley Protocol,\u201d an intensive hormone regimen invented by a writer and actress whose medical credentials consisted of a bachelor\u2019s degree in anthropology. \u201cIs it healthy to be dosed like a 30-year-old when you\u2019re 60?\u201d asks Dr. Joann Pinkerton, Director of the Midlife Health Center at the University of Virginia Health System. \u201cShow me the evidence.\u201d\n\nIn fact, the evidence shows that hormone use is relatively safe only for short periods of three to five years, for women under age 60, says Pinkerton\u2014and even then, only to treat symptoms. The risk of heart disease, stroke, and dementia all increase steeply after after age 70. Somers is 67, but has been using hormone therapy since her 40s, by her own account, including through an episode of breast cancer. And her latest book, of course, essentially advocates lifelong hormone therapy for women\u2014beginning as early as their 30s. \"Not all women actually need this in order to feel good and healthy and OK,\" Santoro points out.\n\nSomers\u2019 ideas have been thoroughly debunked in reputable medical publications: Try the Cleveland Clinic Journal of Medicine, Harvard Women\u2019s Health Watch, and the well-respected Medical Letter, a newsletter for physicians, for starters. The American Society for Reproductive Medicine and the American College of Obstetricians & Gynecologists also think her \u201cbioidentical\u201d hormones are a bad idea. She\u2019s had critical press, too: Newsweek took a pretty hard look at her and Oprah in 2009, and way back in 2001 Larry King (of all people) pretty much busted her for getting liposuction when she was still hawking the Thighmaster. And of course, there is the undeniable contrast between her highly-retouched author photo and her actual appearance. Is this someone you would trust for advice about aging? (And I haven\u2019t even mentioned her wacky, dangerous ideas about cancer.)\n\nBut in America today, it doesn\u2019t really matter that you are wrong, just so long as you are famous\u2014and preferably blonde. For whatever reason, as a culture we've chosen to outsource our medical advice to very good-looking people on TV. So Jenny McCarthy is able to wage her successful anti-vaccine jihad, and Somers can continue to spread her cuckoo theories, because the media and the publishing industry give them a massive platform from which to do so. Somers' books have sold millions of copies, including three #1 New York Times bestsellers, and there are more to come: She\u2019s partway through a three-book deal with Random House. For this latest book, she\u2019s been on CBS\u2019 \"The Talk,\" \"Good Morning America,\" and a passel of local affiliates, with minimal fact-checking pushback from actual medical experts (although Katie Couric tried, and CBS did run this rather tepid report). Inevitably, though, TV and print media set it up as a \"debate,\" with the blonde hottie on one side, looking amazing, and some Debbie Downer \"expert\" (or worse, \"critic\") on the other.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really galling to be competing for scientific legitimacy with Chrissy from 'Three\u2019s Company,'\u201d says one well-respected menopause authority who has tangled with Somers. And perhaps not surprising, given her politics, she is a regular on Fox News, with at least six appearances in a one-week period at the end of September and early October, and nary a breath of criticism.\n\nOh well. At least she\u2019s not on \"The View.\"", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "//assets.newrepublic.com/assets/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "The Obamacare critic's unscientific hormone claptrap", "og": {"site_name": "New Republic", "description": "Long before she was wrong about Obamacare, she was pushing unscientific hormone claptrap", "title": "This is What You Get When You Look to TV Stars for Health Advice: Suzanne Somers, Dangerous Medical Hack", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://images.newrepublic.com/ec602dd4f1161480aaf4b33fb65e735133658900.jpeg?w=1109&h=577&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg", "url": "https://newrepublic.com/article/115574/suzanne-somers-hormone-hackery-unscientific-and-dangerous", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "https://images.newrepublic.com/ec602dd4f1161480aaf4b33fb65e735133658900.jpeg?w=1024&h=512&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg", "title": "This is What You Get When You Look to TV Stars for Health Advice: Suzanne Somers, Dangerous Medical Hack", "description": "Long before she was wrong about Obamacare, she was pushing unscientific hormone claptrap", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@newrepublic"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#ffffff", "parsely-metadata": "{\"thumb_image\":\"http://images.newrepublic.com/ec602dd4f1161480aaf4b33fb65e735133658900.jpeg\"}", "parsely-page": "{\"title\":\"Suzanne Somers Is a Dangerous Medical Hack\",\"link\":\"https://newrepublic.com/article/115574/suzanne-somers-hormone-hackery-unscientific-and-dangerous\",\"section\":\"Health\",\"pub_date\":\"2013-11-13T01:00:00.000Z\",\"post_id\":115574,\"author\":\"Bill Gifford\",\"type\":\"post\",\"tags\":[\"Health\",\"Culture\",\"Suzanne Somers\",\"Hormones\",\"Medicine\",\"Politics\",\"-type_article\"]}", "fb": {"admins": 4404589, "pages": 161419311535, "app_id": 1675346479369918}, "msapplication-TileImage": "//assets.newrepublic.com/assets/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/thenewrepublic", "tag": "Health", "published_time": "2013-11-13"}, "theme-color": "#ffffff"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc681\"", "article_summary": "Somers is 67, but has been using hormone therapy since her 40s, by her own account, including through an episode of breast cancer.\nThen Somers came along and popularized so-called \u201cbioidentical\u201d hormones, which were supposedly natural, unlike the \u201csynthetic,\u201d evil pharma-company versions.\nMany experts object to the aggressive way in which Somers advocates using the hormones, cranking her estrogen (and testosterone!)\nThe American Society for Reproductive Medicine and the American College of Obstetricians & Gynecologists also think her \u201cbioidentical\u201d hormones are a bad idea.\nSoon millions of women had switched to the bioidenticals, for which Somers evangelizes constantly, with seven books on the topic and counting."}
