Arkansans suffering dental pain and discomfort will find much needed relief at the tenth annual Arkansas Mission of Mercy (ArMOM) on May 20th-21st at the University of Arkansas Student Center in Monticello, Arkansas.

Volunteers of all types are needed including hundreds of general volunteers and health professionals such as dentists, hygienists, dental assistants and pharmacists.

Volunteers from across the state will provide free basic dental care to adults and children of all ages on a first-come, first-served basis. Doors open at 6 a.m. each day for cleanings, fillings and extractions. No income or eligibility requirements are necessary.

Since ArMOM began in 2007, over 16,000 patients have been treated in only eighteen total clinic days. The number of procedures performed is staggering. With approximately 24,822 extractions of bad teeth and over 10,030 fillings and other restorations, ArMOM has donated an estimated $8,687,715 worth of free dental care to patients who might otherwise have no hope of receiving care.

Organized by the Arkansas State Dental Association, the 2-day free dental clinic is funded by several sponsors including the Walmart Foundation and a $100,000 grant from the Delta Dental of Arkansas Foundation. Sponsorships are still available.

Media are invited to shoot or broadcast live onsite. Volunteers will be setting up the dental equipment between 8 a.m. and 5 p.m. on May 19. Clinics will open at 6 a.m. on May 20-21.
