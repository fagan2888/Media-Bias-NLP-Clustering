The Elburn man and his extended family have been coming to the event for about 15 years and have a viewing spot right near the starting line.\n\n\"It's a good family event. Fun for the kids,\" he said.\n\nThe truck and tractor pull Saturday featured the machinery in five different classes. John Deere, Farmall and Oliver tractors delighted the crowds, as well as Ford, Dodge and Chevy trucks.\n\nChildren watching on the sidelines wearing protective ear coverings broke into huge smiles as engines revved and tires dug into the dirt at the starting line.\n\nWestrom's sister, Jill Jeppesen, also of Elburn, cheered on friend Lara Tuma of Paw Paw, Illinois, who was competing in the tractor pull with a two-cylinder 1940 John Deere G tractor.\n\n\"I love coming up here,\" Jeppesen said. \"It's just become tradition for our family.\"\n\nAbout 30,000 to 40,000 attendees visit the festival each year, said Chris Halsey, a member of the Elburn Days committee.\n\nThe festival continues Sunday. Highlights include a craft show from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m., mud volleyball at 11:30 a.m. and livestock auction at 1 p.m., all at Lions Park, 500 Filmore St.\n\n\"Everyone comes to Elburn Days for a different reason,\" event chairman Dave Broz said last week. \"We really try and provide a place for anyone in the community to come and have a good time.\"", "article_metadata": {"description": "Elburn Days Friday through Sunday at Elburn Lions Park near Stetzer Avenue and South Street. 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. Saturday. 5K Run and 1M Fun Run/Walk 7 a.m. Saturday, livestock judging at 8 a.m., rummage and bake sale 8 a.m. to 1 p.m. at St. Gall Church and Town and Country Library. ...
