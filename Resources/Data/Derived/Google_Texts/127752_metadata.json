The Trojans had won 38 of their previous 39 games.\n\n\u201cDefinitely, definitely, our best win to date,\u201d said Warriors assistant coach Gerald Nelson, who has been leading the team.\n\nNow 10-3, the Warriors were in danger of getting blown out early. But they quickly gathered themselves and went to work on beating Longmont, which dropped to 11-1.\n\nThe Warriors repeatedly got behind the Longmont zone defense, were superior on the boards and bothered the Trojans on defense through speed and quickness.\n\nSekou Cisse and Russell Wilkerson each scored 15 points, but the city group received other huge contributions, including from freshman point guard Jovan Nelson, Melek Bar and Manel Ayol.\n\nThe Warriors grabbed their first lead at the buzzer to end the third quarter and kept it. Despite turnover issues, some questionable shot selection and missed free throws, they kept the Trojans chasing.\n\nNelson said his team\u2019s initial goal \u201cis to be poised, so we can get our easiest shots. But we\u2019re still a young team (only three seniors) and we still have lots of maturity and learning to do.\u201d\n\nCisse, a chiseled forward, noted his team\u2019s ability \u201cto penetrate and get the ball down low. Everyone was looking unselfishly.\u201d\n\nLongmont left the floor feeling it let one get away, but veteran coach Jeff Kloster said \u201cit\u2019s a good one for us to learn, and we\u2019ll be better because of it.\u201d\n\nThe Warriors also weathered 19 points from Longmont all-stater Justinian Jessup, who is bound for Boise State and fouled out late.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Far Northeast Warriors hand Longmont Trojans first loss", "title": "Far Northeast Warriors hand Longmont Trojans first loss", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/01/16/far-northeast-warriors-hand-longmont-trojans-first-loss/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "height": 630}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2016-01-16T21:18:23+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-01-16T21:18:23+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "The Warriors repeatedly got behind the Longmont zone defense, were superior on the boards and bothered the Trojans on defense through speed and quickness.\n\u201cDefinitely, definitely, our best win to date,\u201d said Warriors assistant coach Gerald Nelson, who has been leading the team.\nThe Far Northeast Warriors basically contain some of the remnants of the old Montbello.\nThose items aside, the Class 5A Warriors took down previously undefeated and 4A top-ranked Longmont 61-55 on Saturday.\nDespite turnover issues, some questionable shot selection and missed free throws, they kept the Trojans chasing."}
