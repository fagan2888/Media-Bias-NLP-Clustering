On Tuesday, the Carson campaign must have been wondering if the candidate\u2019s adviser was, in fact, a double agent.\n\nHow else to explain why, at a moment when foreign policy in general and Middle East policy in particular has taken center stage in the GOP primary race, Duane R. Clarridge would give an on-the-record interview to The New York Times saying that Carson seems unable to absorb key details about foreign policy issues?\n\nRelated: 3 Reasons France Hasn\u2019t Asked NATO to Fight ISIS\n\n\u201cNobody has been able to sit down with him and have him get one iota of intelligent information about the Middle East,\u201d Clarridge said of Carson in the explosive article published Tuesday afternoon.\n\nOn Sunday, after watching Carson stumble through a Fox News interview in which he appeared unable to name any U.S. allies willing to fight against ISIS, Clarridge told reporter Trip Gabriel that he called up Carson confidant Armstrong Williams and said, \u201cWe need to have a conference call once a week where his guys roll out the subjects they think will be out there, and we can make him smart.\u201d\n\nWilliams himself seemed to express frustration, telling Gabriel, \u201che\u2019s been briefed on it so many times. I guess he just froze.\u201d\n\nThe article exploded across social media on Tuesday afternoon, driven largely by political reporters incredulous that anybody involved with a presidential campaign would go on the record blasting a candidate for being unable to grasp important foreign policy issues.\n\nRelated: Putin Doubles Down on Syria Bombing Campaign\n\nWithin hours, the Carson campaign was pushing back. A Carson spokesperson told Business Insider that the Times story had overstated the importance of Clarridge\u2019s role with the campaign.\n\nClarridge is a longtime intelligence operative who was convicted of perjury in connection with the Iran-Contra hearings in the 1980s and then later pardoned. \"He is coming to the end of a long career of serving our country,\u201d the Carson spokesperson told Business Insider. \u201cMr. Clarridge's input to Dr. Carson is appreciated but he is clearly not one of Dr. Carson's top advisors.\u201d\n\nCarson\u2019s campaign also criticized the newspaper, saying, \u201cFor the New York Times to take advantage of an elderly gentleman and use him as their foil in this story is an affront to good journalistic practices.\u201d\n\nThis is the sort of campaign gaffe that is unlikely to be quickly forgotten. The ones that do the most damage are almost always those that reinforce a pre-existing narrative about a candidate \u2014 think of Rick Perry\u2019s \u201coops\u201d moment in the 2008 primary debates that, for many, confirmed that he wasn\u2019t the brightest bulb on the Republican stage.\n\nEven before Clarridge spoke to the Times, the biggest stumbling block between Carson and the GOP nomination was his apparent lack of detailed knowledge about serious policy issues. The Fox interview on Sunday followed a debate performance in which the former surgeon delivered a rambling and at times incoherent answer to a question about ISIS, which included the assertion that China is involved in the conflict in Syria.\n\nRelated: Funding for Syrian Refugees Could Spark a Big Fight in Congress\n\nHaving two of his advisers on the record complaining that he just doesn\u2019t seem to retain information from foreign policy briefings is, to put it mildly, going to hurt.\n\nThat the story broke in a week when ISIS attacked the capital city of a major U.S. ally and the terror group promised that an attack on Washington, D.C. is imminent likely won\u2019t help either.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The campaign gaffes that do the most damage are almost always those that reinforce a pre-existing narrative about a candidate \u2014 think of Rick Perry\u2019s \u201coops\u201d moment in the 2008 primary debates that, for many, confirmed that he wasn\u2019t the brightest bulb on the Republican stage.", "title": "Is There a Double Agent in Ben Carson\u2019s Campaign?", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/11/17/There-Double-Agent-Ben-Carson-s-Campaign", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/usa-election-carson-puerto-rico_2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/11/17/There-Double-Agent-Ben-Carson-s-Campaign", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/usa-election-carson-puerto-rico_2.jpg", "creator": "@rrgarver", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "The campaign gaffes that do the most damage are almost always those that reinforce a pre-existing narrative about a candidate \u2014 think of Rick Perry\u2019s \u201coops\u201d moment in the 2008 primary debates that, for many, confirmed that he wasn\u2019t the brightest bulb on the Republican stage.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "On Tuesday, the Carson campaign must have been wondering if the candidate\u2019s adviser was, in fact, a double agent.\nRelated: Putin Doubles Down on Syria Bombing CampaignWithin hours, the Carson campaign was pushing back.\nOne of the top foreign policy advisers to Dr. Ben Carson is a Central Intelligence Agency veteran with years of service in the field, much of it undercover.\nA Carson spokesperson told Business Insider that the Times story had overstated the importance of Clarridge\u2019s role with the campaign.\n\"He is coming to the end of a long career of serving our country,\u201d the Carson spokesperson told Business Insider."}
