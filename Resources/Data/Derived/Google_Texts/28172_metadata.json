He said the one-year-old program even contributed to a Bluffton man\u2019s death.\n\n\u201cHe was a patient of ours that we took to dialysis on and off for a couple years,\u201d Parsick said. \u201cAs he got older, he kept getting worse and worse.\u201d\n\nMedicare implemented the new rule in South Carolina almost a year ago. It requires patients to obtain prior authorization before the government pays for routine, non-emergency ambulance transportation. In theory, the rule makes sure only the sickest patients who can\u2019t transport themselves qualify for the expensive service.\n\nBut ambulance owners have complained that the company designated to administer Medicare in South Carolina seems to approve and deny transportation requests at whim.\n\n\u201cThe process is arbitrary,\u201d said Josh Watts, who owns MedTrust Medical Transport in Charleston. \u201cThe same patient may be approved this period, and the next period you submit the exact same paperwork ... and get denied. What worked two months ago won\u2019t work now, and you don\u2019t know why.\u201d\n\nPalmetto GBA, a subsidiary of BlueCross BlueShield of South Carolina, administers Medicare in South Carolina. The federal government defines repetitive ambulance service as \u201cmedically necessary ambulance transportation that is furnished three or more times during a 10-day period; or at least once per week for at least three weeks.\u201d It\u2019s often used by patients who need dialysis treatment or chemotherapy.\n\nPatti Embry-Tautenhan, a spokeswoman for Palmetto GBA, pointed out that the criteria didn\u2019t change when the new rule was implemented. The only difference is that patients now need permission before Medicare will pay.\n\n\u201cThis oversight safeguards the Medicare Trust Fund and ensures that taxpayer dollars are spent appropriately for these services,\u201d Embry-Tautenhan said in a prepared statement.\n\nShe would not specify how much money prior authorization has saved Medicare on ambulance transportation since the rule was implemented on Dec. 1 last year. She cited a 2013 federal report that shows ambulance transportation for dialysis patients increased by 269 percent across the country between 2002 and 2011. In South Carolina, ambulance transportation for these patients skyrocketed by 6,920 percent, by far the highest increase in the United States. The report did not determine if some of that growth was tied to fraud.\n\nParsick and other ambulance company owners say they don\u2019t mind the new prior authorization rule, but they believe Palmetto GBA refuses to approve transportation for patients who clearly need help.\n\nRichard Linder, for example, suffered a stroke and from diabetes. He should have easily qualified for routine ambulance transportation, Parsick said, but his requests were repeatedly denied or delayed.\n\n\u201cThe family was getting very worried that they would end up with these huge bills,\u201d he said.\n\nRichard\u2019s wife, Arlene Linder, couldn\u2019t afford to pay for the ambulance out-of-pocket as it costs more than $400 round trip. And she couldn\u2019t drive her husband to dialysis appointments in a regular car. He would slip and fall without the help of trained medics.\n\n\u201cHe couldn\u2019t move at all. He couldn\u2019t walk.,\u201d Linder said.\n\nShe eventually moved her husband into a Walterboro nursing home because she couldn\u2019t wait for the ambulance approvals any longer. He died within three weeks.\n\n\u201cHis body was really failing,\u201d she said. \u201cI think he gave up.\u201d\n\nA spokesman for the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services did not answer questions about the program.\n\nFor now, the rule is only enforced in South Carolina, Pennsylvania and New Jersey, but Medicare will roll it out in six more states, including North Carolina, in January. Eventually the program could become national policy, potentially saving the government hundreds of millions of dollars.\n\nRandy Bowers, a private ambulance company owner in Easley and president of the South Carolina Ambulance Providers Association, said it\u2019s a good idea, but he thinks Palmetto GBA is botching the program to save money at all costs.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just very inconsistent, extremely inconsistent,\u201d Bowers said. \u201cIt\u2019s not about fraud and abuse, it\u2019s about reducing spending.\u201d\n\nLinder insisted her husband needed an ambulance to get to dialysis appointments and that the new rule contributed to his downfall.\n\n\u201cWhat are these people supposed to do? Crawl there? This is ridiculous,\u201d she said. \u201cMaybe Medicare didn\u2019t want him to live that long ... I really believe these politicians just want all the old people to die because that\u2019s basically what will happen. \u201c\n\nReach Lauren Sausser at (843) 937-5598.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Medicare rule draws sharp criticism from ambulance industry, Features, \r\nFeaturesFP LatestNews, \r\nYour Health, \r\nCivic Science Poll, \r\nCivic Science Poll, ambulance,BlueCross BlueShield of South Carolina,Medicare,MedTrust Medical Transport ,Palmetto GBA,Shoreline Medical Transport,South Carolina", "og": {"site_name": "Post and Courier", "description": "Private ambulance company owners in South Carolina have become increasingly critical of a Medicare experiment designed to eliminate insurance fraud and save the federal government money.", "title": "Medicare rule draws sharp criticism from ambulance industry", "url": "http://www.postandcourier.com20151116/151119670/medicare-rule-draws-sharp-criticism-from-ambulance-industry", "image": {"url": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20151116/PC1211/151119670/AR/0/AR-151119670.jpg", "identifier": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20151116/PC1211/151119670/AR/0/AR-151119670.jpg"}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Private ambulance company owners in South Carolina have become increasingly critical of a Medicare experiment designed to eliminate insurance fraud and save the federal government money.", "title": "Medicare rule draws sharp criticism from ambulance industry", "app": {"country": "US", "name": {"ipad": "Post and Courier", "iphone": "Post and Courier", "googleplay": "Post and Courier"}, "id": {"ipad": 603721271, "iphone": 603721271, "googleplay": "com.Synapse.PandC"}}, "site": "@postandcourier", "image": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20151116/PC1211/151119670/AR/0/AR-151119670.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msvalidate.01": "05BAEC9D8820FA9F10D57DB6EB3C6192", "metered": "yes", "p": {"domain_verify": "c6511264bdb6fa45c6bb985fb86d3ab2"}, "fb": {"app_id": 146078808769941}, "tout": {"article": {"id": 151119670}}, "google-site-verification": "rAW9DX7yfiFF82k05QGF6LbZBkxcKxMTzAwNv0OCKAM", "keywords": "Medicare rule draws sharp criticism from ambulance industry , Features, \r\nFeaturesFP LatestNews, \r\nYour Health, \r\nCivic Science Poll, \r\nCivic Science Poll, ambulance,BlueCross BlueShield of South Carolina,Medicare,MedTrust Medical Transport ,Palmetto GBA,Shoreline Medical Transport,South Carolina", "article": {"published_time": "2015-11-16T22:00:00Z", "modified_time": "2015-11-16T14:50:00Z", "author": "Lauren Sausser"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "description": "Private ambulance company owners in South Carolina have become increasingly critical of a Medicare experiment designed to eliminate insurance fraud and save the federal government money."}, "article_summary": "What worked two months ago won\u2019t work now, and you don\u2019t know why.\u201dPalmetto GBA, a subsidiary of BlueCross BlueShield of South Carolina, administers Medicare in South Carolina.\nPrivate ambulance company owners believe a new Medicare rule that requires beneficiaries to obtain prior authorization for non-emergency, routine transportation is jeopardizing patient safety.\nIn South Carolina, ambulance transportation for these patients skyrocketed by 6,920 percent, by far the highest increase in the United States.\nHe should have easily qualified for routine ambulance transportation, Parsick said, but his requests were repeatedly denied or delayed.\n\u201cAs he got older, he kept getting worse and worse.\u201dMedicare implemented the new rule in South Carolina almost a year ago."}
