Sheek Louch is gearing up to drop the sequel to 2008's underrated project, Silverback Gorilla on Dec. 4 via his new home Tommy Boy Entertainment. Silverback Gorilla 2 has a bunch of features with the most notable being Billy Danze, Joell Ortiz, Swizz Beatz, Pusha T, Jadakiss, A$AP Ferg, Styles P, Ghostface, and Fabolous. The album is currently available for pre-order on iTunes here.\n\nThe project's first single, \"What's On Your Mind,\" features two generations of NYC rap in Yung Fergenstein and Kiss. The track's producer Jimmy Dukes uses a very choice Timbaland sample from Ginuwine's \"Keep It Real\" and all three rappers come through with impressive verses. Don't sleep on Donnie G.\n\nListen to \"What's On Your Mind\" below, and check out the Silverback Gorilla 2 tracklist below:\n\n1. \u201cBunndy\u201d (produced by Pav Bundy)\n\n2. \u201cHood Nigga\u201d f/ Billy Danze, Joell Ortiz & Trae Tha Truth (produced by Infamous DJ Haze)\n\n3. \u201cWhat You Want The Money For\u201d f/ Swizz Beatz (produced by Jimmy Dukes & Smiley\u2019s People)\n\n4. \u201cI\u2019m Working\u201d f/ Raheem DeVaughn (produced by Dayzel The Machine)\n\n5. \u201cBang Bang\u201d f/ Pusha T (produced by Shroom)\n\n6. \u201cSkit\u201d\n\n7. \u201cHold It Straight\u201d (produced by Termanology, Shoryfyuz & Sir Bob Nash)\n\n8. \u201cObamacare\u201d f/ Dyce Payne (produced by Termanology & L5)\n\n9. \u201cTrap Stories\u201d (produced by Jimmy Dukes & Smiley\u2019s People)\n\n10. \u201cWhat\u2019s On Your Mind\u201d f/ Jadakiss & A$AP Ferg (produced by Jimmy Dukes & Smiley\u2019s People)\n\n11. \u201cWhat It Is\u201d f/ Styles P (produced by Tone Mason & C-Sharp)\n\n12. \u201cI Luv It\u201d f/ Ghostface Killah (produced by Shroom)\n\n13. \u201cNo Losses\u201d f/ Fabolous (produced by Jimmy Dukes & Smiley\u2019s People)\n\n14. \u201cClap\u201d f/ Dyce Payne (produced by Dayzel The Machine)\n\n15. \u201cLegends\u201d (produced by Supastylez)\n\n16. \u201cYou And Me\u201d(produced by Black Saun)\n\n17. \u201cHood In You\u201d (produced by Joe Milly)", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.thumb": "http://images.complex.com/complex/image/upload/t_feed_thumb/Screen_Shot_2015-11-05_at_10.55.40_AM_copy_opynmn.jpg", "sailthru.author": "Angel Diaz", "description": "Produced by Jimmy Dukes.", "og": {"site_name": "Complex", "description": "Produced by Jimmy Dukes.", "title": "Premiere: Listen to Sheek Louch's \"What's on Your Mind\" f/ Jadakiss & A$AP Ferg", "url": "http://www.complex.com/music/2015/11/sheek-louch-new-song-premiere-what-on-your-mind-featuring-jadakiss-asap-ferg", "image": "http://images.complex.com/complex/image/upload/t_article_image/Screen_Shot_2015-11-05_at_10.55.40_AM_copy_opynmn.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Produced by Jimmy Dukes.", "title": "Premiere: Listen to Sheek Louch's \"What's on Your Mind\" f/ Jadakiss & A$AP Ferg", "url": "http://www.complex.com/music/2015/11/sheek-louch-new-song-premiere-what-on-your-mind-featuring-jadakiss-asap-ferg", "image": "http://images.complex.com/complex/image/upload/t_article_image/Screen_Shot_2015-11-05_at_10.55.40_AM_copy_opynmn.jpg", "site": {"id": 13049362}, "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "card": "summary"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-11-05T12:02:01-0500", "p": {"domain_verify": "51da1c238ae41f7163c35ac3e762917b"}, "fb": {"app_id": 685812641524750}, "sailthru.content.type": "News", "sailthru.tags": "A$AP Ferg, Jadakiss, News, Sheek Louch, Instagram/Social Media, Complex, Music, complex", "keywords": "A$AP Ferg, Jadakiss, News, Sheek Louch, Instagram/Social Media, Complex, Complex Magazine, Style Guide, Fashion News, Celebrity Profiles, Sneakers, Sneakers Guide, Sneakers Blog", "sailthru.channel": "Music", "sailthru.image.full": "http://images.complex.com/complex/image/upload/t_article_image/Screen_Shot_2015-11-05_at_10.55.40_AM_copy_opynmn.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, user-scalable=no, initial-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "\u201cWhat\u2019s On Your Mind\u201d f/ Jadakiss & A$AP Ferg (produced by Jimmy Dukes & Smiley\u2019s People)11.\nSilverback Gorilla 2 has a bunch of features with the most notable being Billy Danze, Joell Ortiz, Swizz Beatz, Pusha T, Jadakiss, A$AP Ferg, Styles P, Ghostface, and Fabolous.\nSheek Louch is gearing up to drop the sequel to 2008's underrated project, Silverback Gorilla on Dec. 4 via his new home Tommy Boy Entertainment.\nDon't sleep on Donnie G.Listen to \"What's On Your Mind\" below, and check out the Silverback Gorilla 2 tracklist below:1.\n\u201cWhat You Want The Money For\u201d f/ Swizz Beatz (produced by Jimmy Dukes & Smiley\u2019s People)4."}
