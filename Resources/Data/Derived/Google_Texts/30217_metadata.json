S&W, ambidextrous safety, semi-automatic or 2 shot bur[s]t trigger group, Tritium night sights for front and rear, rails for attachment of flashlight (front under fore grip) and scope (top rear), stock-collapsib[l]e or folding, magazine - 30 rd. capacity.\u201d\n\n\n\nIn May, the USDA's Office of Inspector General filed a request for these weapons. But why exactly do they need them?\n\nAccording to a USDA press rep, the guns are necessary for self-protection.\n\n\u201cOIG Special Agents regularly conduct undercover operations and surveillance. The types of investigations conducted by OIG Special Agents include criminal activities such as fraud in farm programs; significant thefts of Government property or funds; bribery and extortion; smuggling; and assaults and threats of violence against USDA employees engaged in their official duties,\u201d wrote a USDA spokesperson.\n\nThose seem like legitimate enforcement activities, but still: submachine guns? Not everyone believes the USDA being armed to the teeth is justifiable. On Aug. 2, the Farm to Consumer Legal Defense Fund launched a petition to support a bill that would curb the ability of agencies like the USDA to arm themselves. They see it as overkill and scare tactics, especially for smaller producers.\n\n\u2018What we have seen happen, with the FDA especially, is they have come onto small farms, raw milk producers, and raided the heck out of them with armed agents present.\u2019\n\n\u201cWhat we have seen happen, with the FDA especially, is they have come onto small farms, raw milk producers, and raided the heck out of them with armed agents present,\u201d says Liz Reitzig, co-founder of the Farm Food Freedom Coalition. \u201cDo we really want to have our federal regulatory agencies bring submachine guns onto these family farms with children?\u201d\n\nThe Farm to Consumer Legal Defense Fund petition focuses on two now infamous blows to the raw milk community \u2014 the 2010 and 2011 raids on Rawsome Food Club in Venice, California. These raids were carried out by armed federal agents, from the FDA and other agencies.\n\nThe OIG\u2019s Investigation Development bulletins show there have been three incidents in the last year that involved firearms and two in which USDA agents were verbally threatened. Still, most of their enforcement operations surround white-collar fraud of government programs, often involving SNAP programs. \u201cIf there is fraud in the SNAP program, look at how it is implemented and make changes in the entire program,\u201d says Reitzig. \u201cDon\u2019t bring machine guns onto farms.\u201d\n\nThe Farm to Consumer Legal Defense Fund are not the only ones interested in taking guns out of the hands of USDA agents. Utah Congressman Chris Stewart is the sponsor of the bill on the FTCLDF petition. \u201cAt its heart it comes down to this: To myself, and for a lot of Americans, there is great concern over regulator agencies with heavy handed capabilities,\u201d Rep. Stewart told Modern Farmer.\n\nHis bill, H.R. 4934, hopes \u201cto prohibit certain federal agencies from using or purchasing certain firearms, and for other purposes.\u201d When asked about the USDA\u2019s plan for submachine guns, he said, \u201cI can\u2019t envision a scenario where what they are doing would require that.\u201d\n\nAnother concern is simply accountability. The request for submachine guns from the USDA doesn\u2019t say how many guns \u2014 asking them seems like a non-starter. \u201cThey have been very unhelpful in trying to find out any information about this,\u201d said Rep. Stewart. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t get answers \u2014 it doesn\u2019t seem right to me.\u201d\n\nHowever, he also cautioned: \u201cWe have never argued that federal regulators don\u2019t need to protect themselves.\u201d But if USDA investigations were perceived to be potentially violent he suggested, \u201cThey should do what the rest of us do, call the local sheriff.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "It's unclear why the USDA needs submachine guns, but they want them.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Modern Farmer", "description": "It's unclear why the USDA needs submachine guns, but they want them.", "title": "Why Is the USDA Buying Submachine Guns? - Modern Farmer", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://cdn.modernfarmer.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/USDAGUN3.jpg", "height": 800}, "updated_time": "2016-05-11T00:32:37-04:00", "url": "http://modernfarmer.com/2014/09/usda-buying-submachine-guns/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "It's unclear why the USDA needs submachine guns, but they want them.", "creator": "@ModFarm", "image": "http://cdn.modernfarmer.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/USDAGUN3.jpg", "title": "Why Is the USDA Buying Submachine Guns? - Modern Farmer", "site": "@ModFarm", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"admins": 34000152}, "contextly-page": "{\"title\":\"Why Is the USDA Buying Submachine Guns?\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/modernfarmer.com\\/2014\\/09\\/usda-buying-submachine-guns\\/\",\"pub_date\":\"2014-09-19 11:47:20\",\"mod_date\":\"2016-05-11 00:32:37\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":26009,\"author_id\":\"190\",\"author_name\":\"Charles McFarlane\",\"author_display_name\":\"Charles McFarlane\",\"tags\":[\"Guns\",\"USDA\"],\"categories\":[\"Culture\",\"News\"],\"image\":\"http:\\/\\/modernfarmer.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2014\\/09\\/USDAGUN3.jpg\"}", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/ModernFarmerMedia", "section": "Culture", "tag": "USDA", "published_time": "2014-09-19T11:47:20-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-05-11T00:32:37-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "news_keywords": "guns, usda, home and garden, environment, technology, food, culture, plants, animals"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb83d\"", "article_summary": "The request for submachine guns from the USDA doesn\u2019t say how many guns \u2014 asking them seems like a non-starter.\n\u201cSubmachine guns, .40 Cal.\nThose seem like legitimate enforcement activities, but still: submachine guns?\n\u201cDon\u2019t bring machine guns onto farms.\u201dThe Farm to Consumer Legal Defense Fund are not the only ones interested in taking guns out of the hands of USDA agents.\nAccording to a USDA press rep, the guns are necessary for self-protection."}
