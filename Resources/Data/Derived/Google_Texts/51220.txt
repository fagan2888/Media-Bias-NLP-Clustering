CORVALLIS, Ore. (AP) — Gary Payton II had 17 points with seven steals and Oregon State defeated Colorado 60-56 on Saturday night.

Stephen Thompson Jr. added 14 points off the bench, and clutch free throws for the second game in a row, for the Beavers (14-8, 5-6 Pac-12).

Tre’Shaun Fletcher scored 15 second-half points and Wesley Gordon added 13 points and 11 rebounds for the Buffaloes (17-7, 6-5).

The game was tied at 55 with about a minute left when Josh Fortune missed a lay-in for Colorado. Thompson was fouled on a drive on Oregon State’s next possession and sank both free throws with 28.3 seconds remaining.

With 14.8 seconds left, George King was fouled on a shot for the Buffaloes but made only one.

Thompson was fouled again and made one of two free throws, but Payton grabbed the offensive board and was fouled with 11.2 seconds left. His two free throws sealed the game.

A freshman guard, Thompson made three free throws with .1 seconds left to give Oregon State a 71-69 win over Utah on Thursday.

Colorado outrebounded Oregon State 47-29, but committed 24 turnovers, which led to 21 Beaver points. In a game dominated by scrappy defense, both teams shot poorly, with the Beavers making 35.3 percent of their attempts and the Buffaloes 37.7 percent.

Josh Scott entered the game leading Colorado with 17.3 points and 9.4 rebounds. He had one point and two rebounds in 16 minutes of action on Saturday, and didn’t play in the second half after apparently turning his ankle.

Oregon State led 30-19 at halftime.

Xavier Talton made back-to-back threes to open the second half as part of an 8-0 Colorado run, which made the score 30-27 with 17:58 left.
