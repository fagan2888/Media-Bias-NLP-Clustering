At this point, many have heard of the Reform Conservative movement, but not many know their goals and how their “applied conservatism” may be the key to survival for the future of the conservative movement. One its principal leaders, Yuval Levin, is the author of the new book The Fractured Republic: Renewing America’s Social Contract in the Age of Individualism.

Levin is one of the brightest next generational leaders of the conservative movement and offers a description of what ails our country, while also offering prescriptions to heal our “fractured republic.”

Levin argues that our 21st century political division and stagnation stem from our inability to grapple with troubling symptoms. “Individualism, dynamism, and liberalization have come at the cost of dwindling solidarity, cohesion, and social order. This has left us with more choices in every realm of life but less security, stability, and national unity.”
