Bennet sheds light on local issues in GJ visit\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Affordable Care Act is making headway against costs most everywhere but in western and central Colorado, U.S. Sen. Michael Bennet, D-Colo., said Friday.\n\nThose areas have \u201csome of the most expensive health care on the planet,\u201d Bennet told The Daily Sentinel editorial board.\n\nFixing the act, frequently referred to as Obamacare, is next to impossible in the politically charged atmosphere in Washington, D.C., in which Democrats refuse to change it at all and Republicans want to toss it wholesale, Bennet said.\n\nGrand Junction, which was touted as having some of the lowest Medicare costs, also has some of the highest health care costs overall, according to a database study of spending by insurance plans.\n\nResolving such issues is no clear task, Bennet said.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have answers for Grand Junction, but I\u2019m aware of the problem,\u201d he said.\n\nThe region\u2019s dependence on energy is similarly problematic, Bennet said, noting that renewable sources of energy as well as even coal can be utilized.\n\nClean coal still can have a place in the nation\u2019s energy portfolio, Bennet said.\n\n\u201cWe have to get to neutral\u201d in terms of carbon emissions, he said.\n\n\u201cWhat we want is tax incentives for clean energy, whatever the source is,\u201d Bennet said.\n\nBennet is seeking re-election for the first time this year. He was appointed by Gov. Bill Ritter in 2009 to replace Ken Salazar when Salazar was appointed Interior secretary in the Obama administration. Bennet defeated Weld County District Attorney Ken Buck in 2010.\n\nA decision by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., rejecting hearings for Merrick Garland\u2019s nomination to the Supreme Court will boomerang on a Republican president who wants to make a nomination late in his last term, Bennet said.\n\nThe nation\u2019s fight over immigration is unsettling for people outside the country who worry about barriers to Muslims and the construction of a wall on the Mexico border, causing difficulty for others who wish to emigrate to the United States \u2014 both positions advocated by the presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump, Bennet said.\n\n\u201cThe GOP has to take up where it is on immigration,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"geo.region": "US-CO", "DC.identifier": "http://www.gjsentinel.com/news/articles/sen-bennet-knows-our-issues-has-no-answers/", "geo.placename": "Grand Junction", "description": "Grand Junction - The Affordable Care Act is making headway against costs most everywhere but in western and central Colorado, U.S. Sen.
