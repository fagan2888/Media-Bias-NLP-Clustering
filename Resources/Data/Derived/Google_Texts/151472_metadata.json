That may sound like a lot, but the state -- and the nation -- faces a nursing shortage.\n\n\"Maybe in our larger facilities like the bigger hospitals there's not as much of a shortage,\u201d said Vicky Byrd, executive director of the Montana Nurses Association. \u201cBut if you go into our critical access hospitals or school nursing, absolutely there's a shortage.\"\n\nRecently, U.S. Senator Jon Tester accompanied new VA Secretary Bob McDonald on a tour of VA Montana.\n\nDuring that visit, Tester got the idea to push for more federal funding to help the nursing shortage. He sent a letter to leaders on the Senate Health & Human Services Appropriations Subcommittee, seeking more money for Nursing Workforce Development Programs.\n\nAlso known as Title VIII funding, the program provides grants and scholarships to nursing students.\n\n\u201cIf we're going to have a healthcare system in rural America that works for people that live here we've got to have healthcare professionals in that systems whether its docs or whether its nurses, there's a shortage of both in Montana,\u201d said Tester. \u201cSo we need to do what we can do to train them and attract them so they'll stay here.\u201d\n\nExperts in the field agree. Byrd has been a registered nurse for 26 years and says the key to getting more good nurses starts with attracting more top teachers.\n\n\"We need more qualified and well paid faculty to then teach those nurses and to get them through school,\u201d said Byrd. \u201cWhen many nurses are turned away because there's not a slot in he program, they may correlate that with maybe there's not enough nursing jobs out there.\"\n\nWith more nurses retiring, an aging population, and increased coverage through the Affordable care Act, the American Nurses Association says the Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates during the next two decades there will be a demand for more than a million nurses.\n\nNorlynn Nelson is Associate Director of Patient Care Services at VA Montana.\n\nShe says there are great opportunities for nurses taking care of our veterans through a national nurse education initiative.\n\n\"Nurses who are associate degrees can get their bachelor's degree,\u201d said Nelson. \u201cMost recently one of the things we added is making it possible for some of our registered nurses who want to become nurse practitioners, we'll help them pay for that.\"\n\nNelson says nursing has changed over the years, and while it takes dedication to make it in the profession, one of the nice things about it is the diversity it offers.\n\n\"It might not be directly caring for people, it might be doing insurance , clinical evaluation of insurance claims, that type of thing,\u201d said Nelson. \u201cSo there's all sorts of ways to use that degree.\"", "article_metadata": {"wn-build": "XSLT-7.1-17", "Description": "According to the Montana Nurses Association, there are more than 20,000 nurses in Montana.", "author": "Tim McGonigal", "og": {"url": "http://www.krtv.com/story/29119364/on-special-assignment-montanas-nursing-shortage", "image": "http://KRTV.images.worldnow.com/images/7836611_G.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "According to the Montana Nurses Association, there are more than 20,000 nurses in Montana.", "title": "On Special Assignment: Montana's nursing shortage"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://KRTV.images.worldnow.com/images/7836611_G.jpg", "title": "On Special Assignment: Montana's nursing shortage", "description": "According to the Montana Nurses Association, there are more than 20,000 nurses in Montana.", "card": "summary", "creator": "https://twitter.com/TimMcGonigal"}, "wnreadableurl": "on-special-assignment-montanas-nursing-shortage", "ROBOTS": "index,follow,noarchive", "owner": "KRTV", "fb": {"app_id": 161591973908016}, "date": "2015/05/20", "KEYWORDS": "Great Falls, Montana, News, news, breaking news, weather, CBS", "wn-version": "ContainerE-Story", "wn-base": "IIS17", "news_keywords": "Great Falls, Montana, News, news, breaking news, weather, CBS"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf4b5\"", "article_summary": "That may sound like a lot, but the state -- and the nation -- faces a nursing shortage.\nAccording to the Montana Nurses Association, there are more than 20,000 nurses in Montana.\nDuring that visit, Tester got the idea to push for more federal funding to help the nursing shortage.\n\u201cBut if you go into our critical access hospitals or school nursing, absolutely there's a shortage.\"\nSenator Jon Tester accompanied new VA Secretary Bob McDonald on a tour of VA Montana."}
