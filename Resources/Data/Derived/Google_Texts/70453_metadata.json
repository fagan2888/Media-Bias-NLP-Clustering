On a recent episode of \"Wanda Sykes Presents Herlarious,\" the comedian started her stand-up routine with a focus on government healthcare, beginning with why it might be a good thing for Chicago Bulls point guard Derrick Rose.\n\n\"They say the murder rate is down in Chicago, but Derrick Rose has killed off two knees, huh?\" Sykes says. \"Lucky for Derrick, though, there's Obamacare.\"\n\nSykes speculates that the injured NBA player could have had a difficult time qualifying for health insurance with his latest (second) season-ending knee injury. \"Insurance companies would have been denying him left and right,\" she says. \"Like, 'Uh-uh. You've got a preexisting condition. I saw it on Sports Center.'\"\n\nAs for the technical glitches and functional difficulties many experienced with the Obamacare website during its launch, Sykes believes all the trouble could have been avoided.\n\n\"Let's be honest.
