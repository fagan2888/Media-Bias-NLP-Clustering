Six people involved in an alleged $12 million conspiracy to commit healthcare fraud have been arrested in Houston, according to the U.S. Attorneyâ€™s Office, Southern District of Texas.

Those charged on Thursday include the owner and operator of the clinics and lab, Mktrich "Mike" Yepremian, 58; and Dr. Harding Ross, 61; Dr. Faiz Ahmed, 63; Jermaine Doleman, 38; Michael Wayne Wilson, 46; and Eric Johnson, 61, all of Houston.

The arrests were made as officials executed a search warrant at a downtown office building where several clinics and a blood testing laboratory were located and held in the names of "straw owners," according to authorities.

The clinics involved include Crawford Medical Services, Mid City Healthcare and Care Family Practice, Arca Medical Clinic as well as the lab, Empire Clinical Laboratory.

The scheme allegedly began in 2006 with Yepremian controlling the funds. The 25-count indictment alleges Yepremian paid Doleman, Wilson and Johnson to bring patients to his clinics and billed multiple, medically unnecessary diagnostic and blood tests to Medicare and Medicaid.

Doleman, Wilson and Johnson allegedly paid the patients to attend the clinics. Doleman is also charged in connection to another alleged healthcare fraud scheme over alleged similar conduct.

Yepremian is also charged with money laundering for allegedly funneling money to relatives.

The defendants face up to 5-10 years in federal prison and a possible $250,000 fine.
