In 1769, he established his first mission in San Diego. He would go on to found numerous additional missions, including San Francisco. The missions taught religion and farming.\n\nBut many Native Americans say the missions cut their ancestors off from their traditional languages and cultures, enslaved those who converted to Christianity and brought disease that led to the mass extermination of Indian populations.\n\nSerra\u2019s treatment of Native Americans was controversial during his own life, said Steven Hackel, a University of California, Riverside history professor who has written a biography of Serra.\n\n\u201cThe system he created, he should have known where it was headed,\u201d Hackel said, referring to the disease and death that would plague native populations on missions in the ensuing decades.\n\nThe Vatican has gone on the offensive to present Serra more positively as someone who protected Native Americans from colonial officials. Some historians say Serra saw the missions as refuges for Indians from unscrupulous soldiers and settlers. They say his support for flogging Native Americans reflected a paternalistic attitude that was common at the time.\n\n\u201cFather Junipero Serra was a very, very good person in a very, very bad situation, which I identify as colonialism,\u201d said Andrew Galvan, an Ohlone Indian who curates Mission Dolores in San Francisco and supports Serra\u2019s canonization.\n\nGalvan said he is hopeful Serra\u2019s canonization will open up dialogue between missions and native peoples.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t change what happened in the past. The church has admitted there were mistakes in the past,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we have a golden opportunity as a church today to reach out to native peoples and reconcile. That would be the miracle of Serra.\u201d\n\nArchbishop Jose Gomez of Los Angeles, the highest-ranking Hispanic bishop in the U.S., said Serra\u2019s canonization had an altogether different significance:\n\n\u201cThe first Hispanic pope is coming to America to give us the first Hispanic saint,\u201d the Mexican-born Gomez told a recent church-organized conference in Philadelphia. He called it an \u201chistoric moment in the life of the Hispanic people,\u201d where the pope would be calling on Hispanics across the country to reflect on their history, identity and \u201cour legacy as immigrants.\u201d\n\nCritics say they want action, not words. The pope should help Native Americans regain land they lost, Andrade said.\n\nFlores wants the pope to start by visiting California and acknowledging a detailed list of what she says were the church\u2019s crimes. \u201cWe will never forgive or forget, but we need that in order for our wounds to heal,\u201d she said.\n\nA visit to the state is not on the pope\u2019s itinerary.\n\nThe president of the California Catholic Conference, which represents the state\u2019s bishops, announced Friday that the bishops would revise the cultural displays at California missions and review the third- and fourth-grade curriculum in Catholic schools to better reflect the relationship between the missions and Native Americans. Jaime Soto, Bishop of Sacramento and the conference\u2019s president, said \u201cthe Indian experience has been ignored or denied.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAP Religion writer Rachel Zoll contributed from Philadelphia.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Pope Francis' apology for the Roman Catholic Church's crimes against indigenous peoples has not softened opposition among some California Native Americans to his decision to canonize 18th-century Franciscan missionary Junipero Serra.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Pope Francis\u2019 apology for the Roman Catholic Church\u2019s crimes against indigenous peoples has not softened opposition among some California Native Americans to his decision to canonize 18th-century Franciscan missionary Junipero Serra.", "title": "Pope Francis\u2019 apology doesn\u2019t change opinions on canonization of Junipero Serra", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/sep/5/popes-apology-doesnt-change-opinions-on-canonizati/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/09/05/77c2860cec722627810f6a7067001240.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/09/05/77c2860cec722627810f6a7067001240.jpg", "description": "Pope Francis' apology for the Roman Catholic Church's crimes against indigenous peoples has not softened opposition among some California Native Americans to his decision to canonize 18th-century Fran", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Pope Francis\u2019 apology doesn\u2019t change opinions on canonizat"}, "Author": "Sudhin Thanawala", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Religion Belief, Native Americans, Roman Catholic Church"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9e77\"", "article_summary": "SAN FRANCISCO (AP) \u2014 Pope Francis\u2019 apology for the Roman Catholic Church\u2019s crimes against indigenous peoples has not softened opposition among some California Native Americans to his decision to canonize 18th-century Franciscan missionary Junipero Serra.\nThe Vatican has gone on the offensive to present Serra more positively as someone who protected Native Americans from colonial officials.\nSome historians say Serra saw the missions as refuges for Indians from unscrupulous soldiers and settlers.\nThey say his support for flogging Native Americans reflected a paternalistic attitude that was common at the time.\nThe pope should help Native Americans regain land they lost, Andrade said."}
