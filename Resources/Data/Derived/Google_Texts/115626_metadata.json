A study out of Indiana University found that sexual orientation weighs heavily on how loving couples are perceived to be by other people, who tend to place opposite-sex partnerships on a pedestal. This perception, in turn, affects how many formal and informal rights LGBT couples \u201cdeserve\u201d as far as the general public is concerned, according to study author Long Doan.\n\n\u201cIf you ask what someone thinks of a same-sex couple or what they think of a straight couple, they usually have different images in mind for the same-sex and straight couples,\u201d Doan said. \u201cBy taking away those preconceived differences in relationships, we can pinpoint that the differences in perception are due to sexual orientation alone, instead of other factors that complicate the picture like presumed marital status of same-sex and straight couples.\u201d\n\nDoan and his colleagues, Annalise Loehr and Lisa R. Miller, tested their hypothesis by providing participants with the exact same story \u2014 a romance \u2014 that featured one couple. For each participant, the couples\u2019 names were randomly changed and clearly gendered, to imply that some couples were heterosexual and others homosexual. The researchers found that respondents reacted quite differently to each type of couple: Participants essentially ranked the amount of love partners had for one another hierarchically by sexual orientation, with opposite-sex couples being perceived as \u201cmost in love,\u201d followed by same-sex female couples and then same-sex male couples.", "article_metadata": {"description": "People who believe same-sex couples are \"just as in love\" as heterosexual ones are more generous about equality", "author": "Jenny Kutner", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "People who believe same-sex couples are \"just as in love\" as heterosexual ones are more generous about equality", "title": "More love, more rights", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/08/18/more_love_more_rights/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/06/kissing_couple_male.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "People who believe same-sex couples are \"just as in love\" as heterosexual ones are more generous about equality", "creator": "@@JennyKutner", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/06/kissing_couple_male.jpg", "title": "More love, more rights", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "More love, more rights", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, anti-gay bias, Bigotry, couples, equality, Gay, Gay Marriage, Gender, heterosexual, homosexual, Lesbian, Love, Love and Sex, Marriage, Marriage equality, men, Research, romantic partners, Same-sex marriage, Sex, study, women", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc89a\"", "article_summary": "Topics: anti-gay bias, Bigotry, couples, equality, Gay, Gay Marriage, Gender, heterosexual, homosexual, Lesbian, Love, Love and Sex, Marriage, Marriage equality, men, Research, romantic partners, Same-sex marriage, Sex, study, women, Life News, News, Politics NewsResearchers have found one more incomplete and unsatisfying explanation for why LGBT people don\u2019t have equal rights: Non-LGBT people just don\u2019t think same-sex couples are \u201cas in love\u201d as heterosexual ones.\nThe researchers found that respondents reacted quite differently to each type of couple: Participants essentially ranked the amount of love partners had for one another hierarchically by sexual orientation, with opposite-sex couples being perceived as \u201cmost in love,\u201d followed by same-sex female couples and then same-sex male couples.\n\u201cIf you ask what someone thinks of a same-sex couple or what they think of a straight couple, they usually have different images in mind for the same-sex and straight couples,\u201d Doan said.\nThis perception, in turn, affects how many formal and informal rights LGBT couples \u201cdeserve\u201d as far as the general public is concerned, according to study author Long Doan.\nFor each participant, the couples\u2019 names were randomly changed and clearly gendered, to imply that some couples were heterosexual and others homosexual."}
