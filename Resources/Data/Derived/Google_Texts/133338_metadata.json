A White House official also said the dangerous intercept was a Chinese \u201cprovocation.\u201d\n\nPentagon spokesman Rear Adm. John Kirby on Friday called the maneuvers by the Chinese J-11\u2014a Russian design Su-27\u2014a dangerous and unprofessional encounter and said the military has protested the incident to the Chinese military.\n\n\u201cWe have registered our strong concerns to the Chinese about the unsafe and unprofessional intercept, which posed a risk to the safety and the well-being of the air crew and was inconsistent with customary international law,\u201d Kirby said, adding that the pilot of the J-11 was \u201cvery, very close; very dangerous.\u201d\n\nAsked Saturday about Yang\u2019s assertion, Kirby told the Free Beacon: \u201cWe stand by our account of this dangerous and unprofessional incident.\u201d\n\nThe Carl Vinson strike group will patrol \u201cboth 5th and 7th Fleet areas of responsibility,\u201d the Navy statement said The 7th fleet covers the Pacific and the 5th Fleet is responsible for operations in the Middle East.\n\nThe guided missile cruiser USS Bunker Hill and three guided missile destroyers, the USS Gridley, USS Sterett, and USS Dewey also deployed with the Vinson.\n\nThe Vinson will join the Japan-based USS George Washington strike group.\n\nEarlier, Pentagon spokesman Lt. Col. Jeff Pool said in a statement that the aerial incident took place 135 miles east of Hainan Island when the J-11 came within 20 feet of a U.S. Navy P-8 anti-submarine warfare aircraft.\n\n\u201cThe intercept was aggressive and demonstrated a lack of due regard for the safety and well-being of the U.S. and Chinese aircrews and aircraft,\u201d Pool said, adding that the incident was of the most dangerous aerial encounters with the Chinese since the April 2001 EP-3 mid-air collision with a Chinese J-8.\n\nThe P-8 was on a routine mission in international airspace when the Chinese jet sought to intimidate the crew with several dangerous maneuvers, including a barrel roll over the top of the militarized Boeing 737 jet.\n\n\u201cOn three different occasions, the Chinese J-11 crossed directly under the U.S. aircraft with one pass having only 50 to 100 feet separation between the two aircraft,\u201d Pool said. \u201cThe Chinese jet also passed the nose of the P-8 at 90 degrees with its belly toward the P-8 to show its weapons loadout.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn doing so, the pilot was unable to see the P-8, further increasing the potential for a collision,\u201d Pool said. \u201cThe Chinese pilot then flew directly under and alongside the P-8 bringing their wingtips within 20 feet and then before he stabilized his fighter he conducted a roll over the P-8 passing within 45 feet.\u201d\n\nThe latest incident followed earlier intercepts that the Pentagon said were \u201cnonstandard, unprofessional and unsafe intercepts of U.S. aircraft.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, the aggressive interceptor was based at the same unit on Hainan Island that conducted similar aggressive intercepts in March, April, and May.\n\n\u201cWe are concerned that the intercepting crews from that unit are acting aggressively and demonstrating a lack of regard for the regard for the safety of our aircrews,\u201d Pool said. \u201cWe have raised our concerns over this unsafe behavior to the PRC.\u201d\n\nDeputy White House Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes told reporters the Chinese aerial encounter was \u201ca deeply concerning provocation.\u201d\n\nBoth the Pentagon and White House comments were unusually harsh for the Obama administration, which has sought to play down dangerous and threatening military developments by the Chinese.\n\nYang stated that \u201cmassive and frequent close-in surveillance of China\u201d endangers air and maritime security and is at the root of accidents.\n\nChina is urging the United States to abide by international law and international practices and to respect the concerns of coastal countries, Yang said, adding that Washington should properly deal with the differences between the two nations on air and maritime security issues.\n\nYang said the United States should abide by the principle of \u201cnon-conflict, non-confrontation, mutual respect and win-win cooperation, take concrete actions, reduce and finally stop close-in surveillance of China, so as to create a sound atmosphere for bilateral military ties.\u201d\n\nPool, the Pentagon spokesman, said in his statement Friday that U.S. monitoring is legal.\n\n\u201cUnder international law, as reflected in the 1982 Law of the Sea Convention, military activities may be conducted within the Exclusive Economic Zone of another nation as an exercise of the freedoms of navigation and overflight,\u201d he said. \u201cCoastal states, including China, shall have due regard for the rights and duties of other States, including in the exercise of these freedoms.\u201d\n\nThe aerial encounter comes amid a toughening posture by China in the South China Sea.\n\nU.S. officials said Chinese official statements related to the ASEAN Regional Forum in early August revealed that China had no plans to back off aggressive claims in the South China Sea and is pushing hard to block U.S. involvement in the regional dispute.\n\nChinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi rejected a U.S. proposal to voluntarily freeze destabilizing action in disputed waters, such as China\u2019s placement of an oil-drilling rig in the South China Sea.\n\nChina also announced it was stepping up activities in disputed areas of the sea, challenging claims by Vietnam, Philippines and other nations.\n\nUntil the Defense Ministry statement Saturday, China\u2019s government had remained silent on the Su-27 encounter with the P-8.\n\nMost state-run news outlets in China did not cover the affair, with major newspapers and wire services ignoring the story. Only CCTV, the state television network, reported on the Aug. 19 incident.\n\nCCTV\u2019s report from the network\u2019s Washington correspondent quoted unspecified \u201cChinese experts\u201d as saying the P-8 \u201cposed a threat to their country\u2019s military security over the South China Sea.\u201d\n\nThe White House said Friday through Ben Rhodes, deputy national security advisers, that the Chinese jet, which conducted a barrel roll over the P-8 some 135 miles east of Hainan Island was a \u201cprovocation.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Free Beacon", "description": "The Navy is sending a second aircraft carrier strike group to the Asia Pacific region amid new tensions with China over a dangerous aerial encounter between a Chinese interceptor and Navy P-8 surveill", "title": "U.S. Sends Second Carrier to Asia Amid Tensions with China", "url": "http://freebeacon.com/national-security/u-s-sends-second-carrier-to-asia-amid-tensions-with-china/", "image": "http://freebeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/AP711477619573-150x150.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The Navy is sending a second aircraft carrier strike group to the Asia Pacific region amid new tensi", "creator": "@BillGertz", "image": "http://freebeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/AP711477619573-150x150.jpg", "title": "U.S. Sends Second Carrier to Asia Amid Tensions with China", "site": "@freebeacon", "card": "summary"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1047859882", "fb": {"app_id": "FB_APP_ID", "pages": 282024895179874}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "BY: Follow @BillGertzThe Navy is sending a second aircraft carrier strike group to the Asia Pacific region amid new tensions with China over a dangerous aerial encounter between a Chinese interceptor and Navy P-8 surveillance craft.\nChina\u2019s military on Saturday, meanwhile, demanded an end to all U.S. monitoring flights and called U.S. criticism of dangerous Chinese jet maneuvers false.\nThe guided missile cruiser USS Bunker Hill and three guided missile destroyers, the USS Gridley, USS Sterett, and USS Dewey also deployed with the Vinson.\nMost state-run news outlets in China did not cover the affair, with major newspapers and wire services ignoring the story.\nYang called Pentagon criticism of the incident \u201ctotally groundless\u201d and insisted the Chinese pilot operated professionally and kept a safe distance."}
