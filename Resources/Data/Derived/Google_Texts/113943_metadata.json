That increase has created a lopsided ideological spread in higher education, with liberal professors now outpacing their conservative counterparts by a ratio of roughly 5 to 1.\n\nIn 2014, 60 percent of professors identified as \u201cliberal\u201d or \u201cfar left,\u201d according to the Higher Education Research Institute at UCLA, as reported by The Washington Post\u2019s \u201cWonkblog.\u201d\n\nCompare that with 1990 survey data, when only 42 percent said the same.\n\nWhile academia has shifted dramatically to the left, professors on the right have dropped off.\n\nThe number of professors who identified as \u201cconservative\u201d and \u201cfar right\u201d during the same time span fell by nearly 6 percent, while the number of \u201cmoderate\u201d academics dropped by 13 percentage points.\n\nMatthew Woessner, an associate professor of political science and public policy at Penn State Harrisburg, studies political trends in higher education and advocates increased diversity of viewpoints with a group of academics who call themselves Heterodox Academy.\n\nWoessner, who says he is a conservative Republican, said the study raises important questions on whether the liberal tilt that has persisted in higher education is becoming more pronounced, and if so, what impact that has on the national political discourse.\n\nDaniel Klein, a professor of economics at George Mason University, said the reported 5-to-1 ratio is \u201cnot very meaningful\u201d because the terms \u201cliberal\u201d and \u201cconservative\u201d have become \u201cexceedingly troubled.\u201d\n\nInstead, Klein predicted that the imbalance between faculty who vote Democratic compared with those who vote Republican is closer to 9 to 1 or even 10 to 1.\n\nEither way, as professors have become more liberal, they\u2019ve shifted far to the left of the general public and their students, Woessner told The Daily Signal.\n\nA Gallup poll released earlier this month found that 38 percent of Americans identify as conservative, versus 24 percent who identify as liberal.\n\nAnd while the study by the Higher Education Research Institute reported that liberal students outpace conservative students by nearly 10 percent, roughly half identify as moderate. This has created a wide ideological gap between professors and students.\n\nIn 2014, college professors were roughly 30 percentage points more likely to identify as liberal than were college freshmen. Compare that to the 1990 findings, when professors were 16 percentage points more likely to label themselves as liberal than were their freshmen students. Woessner said:\n\nThis raises critical questions of whether students are getting a balanced education\u2014not because there\u2019s some conspiracy to block out conservative ideas, but merely because the people who are teaching are either not familiar with or don\u2019t embrace conservative ideas.\n\nEven when faculty attempt to present an issue in a balanced and impartial manner, he said, personal biases naturally bleed into material.\n\nAccording to 2009 data from the Higher Education Research Institute, the number of students who said their political views were \u201cliberal\u201d or \u201cfar left\u201d jumped 9.2 percentage points from freshman to senior year.\n\nCarson Holloway, an associate professor of political science at the University of Nebraska Omaha, said the imbalance is most notable in the humanities and social science fields, where the battle of ideas is most important.\n\nHolloway, who also chairs the Council of Academic Advisers at The Heritage Foundation, said the average political scientist in the U.S. is a \u201cmainstream\u201d liberal.\n\nThe problem with this, he said, is that a lot of \u201cimpressive\u201d thought stemming from Europe fostered conservative ideology, but because not many in the academy represent that tradition, students get a skewed view.\n\n\u201cThey might tend to think that conservatism is not an intellectual tradition because they don\u2019t see any professors who hold to it, so there\u2019s a distortion that emerges there,\u201d Holloway told The Daily Signal.\n\nWoessner said the students who are harmed the most by the bias in academia are the liberal ones:\n\nConservatives benefit from having liberal ideas to expand their horizons and challenge their thinking, but ideologically liberal students get their ideas reinforced. This means they\u2019re not growing intellectually because they don\u2019t have the exposure to other ideas to make them think.\n\nWoessner said an equal number of liberal and conservative professors isn\u2019t necessary for higher education to work well, but at least a small minority of faculty on campus should hold different views.\n\nConservatives who want to become involved in higher education face challenges, he said, and universities should encourage more right-leaning academics to become professors to help shrink the ideological gap.\n\n\u201cThe goal should not be an even split, because that\u2019s probably impossible, but to create a space for enough conservative ideas that students are exposed at least nominally to these other perspectives,\u201d Woessner said.\n\nAnd although a prescriptive fix to obtain greater balance won\u2019t happen on its own, Klein said, \u201cdonors, students and parents should vote with their dollars, and voters should vote with their votes against pouring taxpayer money into a leftist apparatus.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "While academia has shifted dramatically to the left, professors on the right have dropped off.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "While academia has shifted dramatically to the left, professors on the right have dropped off.", "title": "Liberal Professors Outnumber Conservative Faculty 5 to 1", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/160113_LiberalProfessors_Johnson.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-03-14T15:29:22+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1OkymXc"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "While academia has shifted dramatically to the left, professors on the right have dropped off.", "title": "Liberal Professors Outnumber Conservative Faculty 5 to 1", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/160113_LiberalProfessors_Johnson.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Education", "tag": "higher ed", "published_time": "2016-01-14T16:45:47+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-03-14T15:29:22+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Liberal professors, higher education, liberal bias, Higher Education Research Institute, Matthew Woessner, Heterodox Academy, Carson Holloway, academia"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe18bb\"", "article_summary": "That increase has created a lopsided ideological spread in higher education, with liberal professors now outpacing their conservative counterparts by a ratio of roughly 5 to 1.\nWoessner said an equal number of liberal and conservative professors isn\u2019t necessary for higher education to work well, but at least a small minority of faculty on campus should hold different views.\nWoessner said the students who are harmed the most by the bias in academia are the liberal ones:Conservatives benefit from having liberal ideas to expand their horizons and challenge their thinking, but ideologically liberal students get their ideas reinforced.\nAnd while the study by the Higher Education Research Institute reported that liberal students outpace conservative students by nearly 10 percent, roughly half identify as moderate.\nDuring the past quarter-century, academia has seen a nearly 20-percent jump in the number of professors who identify as liberal."}
