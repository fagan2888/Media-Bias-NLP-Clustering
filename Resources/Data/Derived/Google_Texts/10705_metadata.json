Charles Boustany Charles Boustany House Republican pushes bill to 'curb regulatory overreach' Overnight Finance: GOP chairman moves to censure IRS chief | Puerto Rico deal close? | Fed eyes June rate hike | Obama's secret meeting with China's richest man Dozens of House members promote tax bills at hearing MORE (R-La.), chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee\u2019s tax-policy subcommittee. The hearing was the subcommittee\u2019s first since Boustany became its chairman.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nBoustany said that since Congress last passed comprehensive tax reform in 1986, other countries have reformed their tax codes to attract international investment and multinational companies have taken steps to lower their tax burdens.\n\nHe brought up the recent announcement that U.S. pharmaceutical giant Pfizer is going to merge with Irish-based Allergan, with the merged company keeping Allergan\u2019s legal residence in Ireland. The transaction would be the largest-ever example of a practice known as a corporate inversion, in which a company reincorporates overseas to take advantage of a lower tax rate.\n\n\u201cThat is not the first, nor will it be the last, foreign acquisition pushed over the line\u201d by the U.S. tax code, he said.\n\nRep. Pat Tiberi (R-Ohio) asked Robert Stack, Treasury Department deputy assistant secretary for international tax affairs, why Congress and the Obama administration can\u2019t help them lower the corporate tax rate and move to a system in which large U.S. businesses are on an equal playing field with foreign businesses.\n\n\u201cI think you\u2019ve just described the president\u2019s plan,\u201d Stack replied. Obama\u2019s plan would lower the corporate rates, broaden the base and put U.S. corporations on an equal footing in certain jurisdictions, he said.\n\nThe subcommittee\u2019s ranking member, Rep. Richard Neal (D-Mass.), also said he hoped the hearing could be used as a \u201cspringboard\u201d for revenue-neutral business tax reform.\n\nNeal asked Stack if there are any steps that Congress could take prior to passing tax reform that could curb inversions.\n\nStack replied that there are actions Congress could take. Under current law, inversions are prohibited for tax purposes if shareholders of the U.S. company own more than 80 percent of the merged company, and Stack said that it would be helpful for Congress to lower that threshold to 50 percent.\n\nCongress could also plug \u201cinterest stripping\u201d rules so that inverted companies would not be able to take excess income out of the United States in the form of interest. \u201cI don\u2019t see those as necessarily having to wait\u201d for tax reform, he said.\n\nStack said that legislation introduced by Rep. Sander Levin (D-Mich.), which is similar to a proposal in President Obama\u2019s budget request, would slow inversions by itself.\n\nBut Rep. Mike Kelly (R-Pa.) disagreed. He said he\u2019d rather see a \u201ccarrot\u201d than a \u201cbigger stick.\u201d\n\nStack said that the U.S. does need to be able to raise revenue and the corporate tax rate can\u2019t just be lowered to zero.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Rep.
