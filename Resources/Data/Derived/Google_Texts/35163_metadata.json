What attention the period show gets is generally for its depiction of the relationship at its center \u2014 between the two sex researchers, the highly respected William Masters and the marginalized Virginia Johnson. (They\u2019re played, well, by Michael Sheen and Lizzy Caplan; Caplan is nominated for a best actress Emmy and would be a worthy winner.)\n\nThe version of \u201cMasters of Sex\u201d that would likely get much more press, one suspects, would be one that tightly focused on Sheen\u2019s internal drama and his power-mongering within the hospital, at the expense of the very real thoughts and feelings of the women around him. Either way, \u201cMasters of Sex,\u201d for whatever reason \u2014 its unexplosive subject matter, its less-showy performances \u2014 is low-wattage, as cable dramas go. And so it is that the most fascinating gay character on television has gotten much less press than he deserves. Beau Bridges\u2019 performance as a gay man who\u2019s not quite in the closet (at least not to his wife) but deeply uncomfortable with his own desires has been a highlight of television over the past year. And Bridges\u2019 performance deserves more attention for the way it\u2019s able to bring to tragic life the gay experience in the 20th century. Anyone who thinks that \u201cHouse of Cards'\u201d convenient deployment of Frank Underwood\u2019s fluid sexuality is tacky and unrealistic should be calling their cable provider to get Showtime now.\n\nBridges\u2019 Barton Scully, a fictional provost at Washington University (where Masters and Johnson work), only supports the study of human sexuality because he\u2019s been blackmailed \u2014 Masters knows Scully sleeps with male prostitutes. Scully wants, very badly, to be \u201cgood\u201d by the standards of the day; he\u2019s married, with a daughter, and he wants the marriage to work even despite his wife\u2019s misery. His wife, Margaret, is a glum survivor who knows that her marriage is not like that of others; the scene in which Allison Janney\u2019s tense face betrays her character\u2019s embarrassment over her nonexistent sex life is, a year later, painful to watch.\n\nIn the season premiere two weeks ago, Barton\u2019s inner turmoil came to a head; the character underwent electroshock therapy whose aftereffects were grotesque. He threw up on-screen, begged for his wife, and was, in the end, still gay. His attempt at sex with his wife (from behind, so that he didn\u2019t need to look at her) was reminiscent of a throwaway scene in \u201cBrokeback Mountain\u201d; how far entertainment has come that \u201cMasters of Sex\u201d gave Janney the opportunity to speak her mind and beg her husband to look at her.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Barton Scully, played by Beau Bridges, perfectly captures the experience of being closeted in the 1950s", "title": "This is the best gay character on television: How \u201cMasters of Sex\u201d gets the tragedy of 1950s gay life right", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Barton Scully, played by Beau Bridges, perfectly captures the experience of being closeted in the 1950s", "title": "This is the best gay character on television: How \u201cMasters of Sex\u201d gets the tragedy of 1950s gay life right", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/07/27/this_is_the_best_gay_character_on_television_how_masters_of_sex_gets_the_tragedy_of_1950s_gay_life_right/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/07/barton_scully.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Barton Scully, played by Beau Bridges, perfectly captures the experience of being closeted in the 1950s", "title": "This is the best gay character on television: How \u201cMasters of Sex\u201d gets the tragedy of 1950s gay life right", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/07/barton_scully.jpg", "creator": "@dpd_", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Daniel D'Addario", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, 1950s, Allison Janney, beau bridges, Editor's Picks, gay culture, Masters of Sex, TV", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda868\"", "article_summary": "Either way, \u201cMasters of Sex,\u201d for whatever reason \u2014 its unexplosive subject matter, its less-showy performances \u2014 is low-wattage, as cable dramas go.\nAnd so it is that the most fascinating gay character on television has gotten much less press than he deserves.\nAnd Bridges\u2019 performance deserves more attention for the way it\u2019s able to bring to tragic life the gay experience in the 20th century.\n(They\u2019re played, well, by Michael Sheen and Lizzy Caplan; Caplan is nominated for a best actress Emmy and would be a worthy winner.)\nHe threw up on-screen, begged for his wife, and was, in the end, still gay."}
