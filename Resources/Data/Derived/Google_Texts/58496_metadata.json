Their new book, Nation on the Take: How Big Money Corrupts Our Democracy (read an excerpt), is a comprehensive and important examination of the many ways our lives are affected by the stranglehold corporations have on our government and society. And it\u2019s a look at how we can fight back.\n\nWendell Potter is senior analyst at the Center for Public Integrity, an ex-newspaperman and a former executive with the health insurance industry who dared to come in from the cold and become one of our most knowledgeable and forthright champions of health care reform. Regulars here at BillMoyers.com will remember his 2009 appearance on Bill Moyers Journal, when he first told his remarkable story.\n\nNick Penniman, a former journalist, was co-founder and director of the Huffington Post Investigative Fund, publisher of Washington Monthly and founder of the American News Project. He is executive director of Issue One, a bipartisan group working to reduce the influence of money in politics and to put everyday citizens back in control of our country.\n\nOur conversation began with Wendell and Nick talking about how their book Nation on the Take came to be. Listen using the streaming audio above, or read the transcript, slightly edited for clarity, below.\n\nTRANSCRIPT\n\nWendell Potter: I guess I\u2019m known most for leaving my job in the insurance industry and becoming an advocate for health care reform. And it became pretty clear to me toward the end of that health care reform debate that nothing would really get done that really benefits consumers in the way that it should until we do something about money in politics.\n\nMy first book, Deadly Spin, began to explain why we didn\u2019t get the health care reform that we needed and so this book that Nick and I have written goes a bit beyond that and also looks at other industries and it attempts to connect the dots to show how big money in politics affects us on a daily basis.\n\nNick Penniman: I came to this because I had spent more than a decade in Washington doing long form reporting and investigative reporting as a publisher and magazine editor. And most of the good stories that we did ultimately led back to some policy dysfunction, which ultimately led back to money in politics. It was a combination of that and watching the sausage making around Obamacare and around the attempt at financial reform that made me realize that we\u2019ve reached a point in this country in which the money power is so significant that it\u2019s hard to truly fix anything. So Wendell and I, after many soulful discussions about this, decided to team up and do this book.\n\nMichael Winship: It\u2019s a stunning indictment of the corrosive influence of money in politics. In the introduction, you have a sentence, \u201cWe the people are losing our faith in the dream of democracy as our collective power is increasingly eclipsed by a rigged system of politics and governance dominated by a handful of billionaires and a phalanx of well-financed special interests.\u201d Which is quite a statement.\n\nPotter: It is quite a statement. In fact, for a while, our working title for the book was Rigged. The system is rigged against regular people, and as we write in the book the system largely has been taken over by a few very, very wealthy individuals and families, and how public policy is so influenced by rich and entrenched special interests that in a sense we\u2019ve lost our ability to self-govern.\n\nPenniman: We also make the point that this is not something that is just newly upon our democracy. This problem has been metastasizing for more than 30 years quietly in Washington. You know, the number of lobbyists has gone through the roof, the amount of dark money in the system has gone through the roof, the number of billionaires who are writing bigger checks has gone through the roof. The amount of time members of Congress spend fundraising, same thing. Every single index that you could look at that defines the problem of money in politics has grown exponentially in the last thirty years. But it\u2019s occurred kind of quietly. Some reporters cover it, but they don\u2019t really cover the big picture writ large. It\u2019s no longer just that irksome thing that all Americans hate, right? It\u2019s really reached the point of stage IV cancer, where it\u2019s shutting down the body politic, it\u2019s shutting down our ability to self-govern.\n\nOne of the things you talk about is the impact of Citizens United and some of the other Court decisions that have crippled campaign finance reform. You describe it as \u201ccrop spraying gasoline onto a wildfire.\u201d\n\nPenniman: Yes, it was a terrible and misguided decision in many ways, and what it\u2019s done is it\u2019s created a real permissiveness within primarily the billionaire community to play much bigger and harder in politics than ever before. So it\u2019s almost more of the mentality and psychology that the decision created than the legal reality that it created. And what I mean by that is that it\u2019s not as if wealthy individuals weren\u2019t already pumping a lot of money into politics before 2010, before Citizens United. But they feel as if they have every right to do it and have no limits to it in the wake of Citizens United.\n\nYou have a great line in the book where you say that \u201ceven if the donor has no expectation of bending legislation, pressuring a government official for a favor, the process of raising it marinates the minds of politicians and the concerns of the wealthiest among us.\u201d\n\nThe people that they see day in and day out are the lobbyists, not regular folks back home and Capitol Hill is just overrun with lobbyists now compared to what it was just a few years ago. \u2014 WENDELL POTTER\n\nPotter: Yes, exactly. And we\u2019re not talking necessarily about the quid pro quo transactions. That really doesn\u2019t take place very much at all. It is the knowledge that an elected official has of who is writing the check, who\u2019s going to be there if and when this person decides to run for reelection, that they can expect another campaign check if they have demonstrated that they are voting the way the donor wants. So it is something that has really begun to influence the system in ways that it didn\u2019t when Nick and I were reporters covering politics many years ago. And as Nick said, it has happened largely without very much media scrutiny. The reporters who are covering government, covering politics in Washington pretty much ignore what\u2019s going on as they\u2019re writing stories about what politician said this or that or which politician is saying this or that on the campaign trail.\n\nPenniman: I would add that anyone who really loves fishing will tell you that the key to good fishing is to think like the fish. And that\u2019s what our politicians are required to do every day and the fish that they\u2019re trying to get to are \u2014 there are really two of them \u2014 wealthy individuals who can max out at $2,700 to their campaigns and lobbyists who can do the same. So what ends up happening is they end up thinking like those fish and they\u2019re not thinking like the folks back home in district who are working multiple jobs and who have a lot of needs.\n\nPotter: The people that they see day in and day out are the lobbyists, not regular folks back home and Capitol Hill is just overrun with lobbyists now compared to what it was just a few years ago.\n\nYou make mention of the townhouses on Capitol Hill, which are either run by lobbyists now or are call centers for party fundraising.\n\nPotter: That\u2019s right, both the Democratic and Republican congressional committees have offices a few doors away or a few feet away from the Capitol. Members of Congress leave their offices and go to these buildings, go to the cubicles and dial for dollars there. And the townhouses that we wrote about, they look at just first glance like someone actually lives there, but many of the townhouses around the Capitol and other buildings have been bought and are operated by special interests, whether it\u2019s a big corporation or a labor union or a lobbying firm. They just ring the Capitol.\n\nYou also make an excellent point that all the time spent fundraising is also time that could be spent crafting or better understanding legislation. Not to mention time spent with colleagues on the business of governance, and even just getting to know each other, which is no small thing.\n\nPenniman: What\u2019s amazing is that in this era of extraordinary political polarization, there is so little talk about whether or not our politicians even have the time to get together to sit down and talk and to go through legislation and to build common ground. When you\u2019re spending four to five hours a day just dialing for dollars or trying to recruit money from the lobbyists that you\u2019re supposed to be regulating, it\u2019s hard to find the time. And that\u2019s what Senator Tom Harkin from Iowa said when he left the Senate. He said there just isn\u2019t enough time for us as senators to work together anymore because we\u2019re all out there trying to raise the money.\n\nYou write in the book about how AT&T, for example, has 88 percent Hill coverage, meaning that 88 percent of all the members of Congress have gotten campaign contributions from AT&T. Same with Honeywell International, 87 percent from UPS, 80 percent from Lockheed Martin and on and on. What does that tell you?\n\nThe big corporations and entities are\u2026very bipartisan in their check writing. \u2014 WENDELL POTTER\n\nPotter: It tells you that they\u2019re very generous with the check writing. The big corporations and entities are able to do that and they\u2019re very bipartisan in their check writing. They in many cases write just as many checks to Democrats as they do to Republicans and they certainly pay a great deal of attention to who is a committee chair or ranking member of a committee or is in some other leadership capacity. They\u2019re very strategic. One of the things I used to do in my job in the insurance industry was administer the political action committee and there\u2019s a lot of thought that goes into who you write checks to, and you want to make sure that you\u2019re writing checks to people who can be persuaded to see things from your perspective and vote for the things that you want them to or vote against things you are not supporting when the time comes.\n\nPenniman: How many regular Americans have that kind of Hill coverage? You know, Bob Dole once quipped that there is no poor people\u2019s political action committee in Washington. So when you\u2019re underrepresented with the financial resources of politics, as most Americans are, then you\u2019re underrepresented with the lawmaking too.\n\nYou use the metaphor of a newborn baby named Eve, and all that child is going to be put up against as a result of lobbying and campaign contributions.\n\nPotter: We use that to just drive home the point of how we and those we love, our children and everyone that we know, including ourselves, are affected by this from cradle to grave. In the middle part of the book, we look at five different industries and show how these industries in one way or another are able to impact so much of Eve\u2019s life and her parents\u2019 life, whether it\u2019s their mortgage or the air that we breathe or the college debts that Eve\u2019s parents might have, everything is affected in one way or another because of public policy and public policy is so heavily influenced now by special interests.\n\nPenniman: We also are using that to take on the argument about government, the size of government. Our point is that in a country with 330 million people, a pretty significantly sized government will exist in a country as big as ours and as powerful as ours. And therefore, it is either going to be working for the best interest of the common good or it\u2019s not. So let\u2019s get over this kind of abstract argument about the size of government and realize that it exists and it\u2019s either going to be controlled by the special interests on behalf of the narrow interests of a few or it\u2019s going to be controlled by all of us on behalf of our common interests.\n\nPotter: And we use the term \u201cthe system.\u201d Big money has created its own system and we note that Eve can\u2019t escape the system, her parents can\u2019t, you can\u2019t, we can\u2019t collectively escape the system that has been created and that so many people see as being rigged against them.\n\nWhen you talk about that size of government and the necessity of that national government, you also talk about how all this influence has also trickled down to state and local governments.\n\nPotter: We do. We\u2019ve looked a lot at state and local governments and in the chapter in particular on fossil fuel. We looked at my state of Pennsylvania. I live in Pennsylvania and the lawmakers in Harrisburg and the previous governor were very, very close to the fossil fuel industry, the fracking companies, to the point that we\u2019ve seen a lot of communities just really affected adversely by the way that those companies were able to operate and influence lawmakers in Harrisburg, including the previous governor and even Governor Ed Rendell, Democratic governor, after he left office. So we look at not just what\u2019s going on in Washington but also how this is pervasive as well almost at any state capital and many municipalities as well.\n\nYou just used the energy industry as an example. Another is the banks and the too big to fail bailout of 2008. Since 1998, nearly $4 billion in contributions to federal candidates and super PACs have been made by the banks and the real estate interests and financial interests.\n\nPotter: Their contributions have been extensive and continue to be so and certainly the legislation that was finally approved by Congress, the Dodd-Frank Act, and other pieces of legislation that have been proposed to regulate the financial industry were written to a large extent by the lobbyists for financial institutions. And we point out in the book how the interest of the banks and mortgage companies were served first, and the challenges and the difficulties that a lot of average homeowners are having even yet today to keep their homes out of foreclosure.\n\nPenniman: The House Finance Committee in Washington, the nickname for it is the Cash Committee, not because they deal with finance but because it\u2019s such a lucrative perch to collect campaign contributions from. It\u2019s like winning the lottery ticket. Of the 435 members of the House, 60 of them are members of the finance committee because you just can rake in money from bank executives and bank lobbyists when you\u2019re on the committee. I remember watching Bill Moyers\u2019 show a number of years ago when he had Gretchen Morgenson on, the chief financial reporter for The New York Times, and when she was asked whether or not Dodd-Frank had tackled the big stuff, she said, \u201cNo, absolutely not. It hasn\u2019t and we could likely have another financial crisis as a result.\u201d And when asked why, she said, \u201cBecause the banks have hundreds of lobbyists in Washington and the American people have none.\u201d\n\nThe two of you go back even further from before the meltdown and talk about the repeal of Glass-Steagall during the Bill Clinton years.\n\nPotter: Yes, we need to remember that this is not an affliction that leans more toward the Republican Party than the Democratic Party. Both parties are very afflicted by this and when Bill Clinton and other Democrats in the 1980s saw the potential decline of union money and unionization, they realized that that would create a decline in income for the Democratic Party, so they went out and started actively recruiting money that they hadn\u2019t sought previously, corporate money. And a lot of that money came directly from Wall Street. They also went to the pharmaceutical companies and the health care companies and they went harder at Hollywood. But an active marriage occurred between Wall Street and the Democratic Party in the \u201880s and \u201890s and it culminated in 1999 in the repeal of Glass-Steagall with the \u200eGramm-Leach-Bliley legislation. Bill Clinton signed it and a lot of the people who worked in the White House and worked for him helped manufacture it.\n\nAnother one of your chapters is specifically about the pharmaceutical industry. I was wondering if you could tell us a little bit about the saga of Billy Tauzin.\n\nPotter: Billy Tauzin was a congressman from Louisiana. He rose to leadership initially in the Democratic party but during the Republican revolution, the Gingrich years, he came to the conclusion that he needed to change parties. So he became a Republican, was reelected and soon became a leader in the Republican party as well. And the leadership roles included a very influential role on a committee that wrote the legislation that pertains to health care and in particular the pharmaceutical industry. He became a favorite of the pharmaceutical industry and was there for them on a couple of very important occasions, in particular during the debate on the Medicare Part D prescription drug benefit in 2003.\n\nHe was very instrumental in making sure the pharmaceutical industry\u2019s interests were protected and the legislation was written largely by lobbyists for the industry who worked with him and a few other congressional leaders to shape the legislation in ways that led to huge profitability in the pharmaceutical industry. The pharmaceutical industry and the manufacturing companies have among the highest profit margins in the world of any companies and people in the US pay far more for medications, including people who are Medicare beneficiaries, than anywhere else in the world.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Corporations have a stranglehold on both parties.
