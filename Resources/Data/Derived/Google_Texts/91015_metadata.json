Recognizing the politics of the piece, the White House caved. Whatever Secretary of State Kerry gets out of the Iranians after 18 months of delicate diplomacy must now survive the nitpicks of a Congress not short of members hostile to the enterprise.\n\n\n\n\n\nvoted unanimously On Thursday, three powerful members of Congress determined to give the administration fast-track authority to push through a vastly ambitious trade pact with a dozen (so far) Asian nations known as the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Once this deal reaches final form, which is expected shortly, senators and representatives can put a thumb up or down but surrender all rights to question any TPP provision.\n\nRelated: Voters Want an Iran Nuke Deal\u2014If Congress Approves\n\nHere\u2019s the question, not too complicated: What the heck is going on in Washington? Congress wants in on a potentially historic foreign policy on Tuesday and wants out of another one two days later.\n\nThese two judgments are upside down. And both threaten to bite Americans in the backside down the road.\n\nThe problem is simply stated. I argue strenuously for a foreign policy process subject to the electorate\u2019s wishes\u2014a politicized foreign policy, you can say. But that\u2019s not what we\u2019re watching. What\u2019s unfolding is more or less the opposite.\n\nPoll upon poll lately\u2014Hart Research, Reuters/Ipsos, the Program for Public Consultation at the University of Maryland\u2014show that the majority of Americans favor an accord with Iran roughly in the form now understood in outline. They don\u2019t trust Iran any more than Iranians trust America, and many are O.K. with Congress weighing in. But on balance, they don\u2019t want this deal to die on Capitol Hill.\n\nRelated: U.S. Concerned Over Russia Lifting Ban on Missiles to Iran\n\nIn this case, we have a corruption of democratic process posing as democratic process. Unless you think there is something very wrong with the Constitution, the president must be able to reach agreements with other nations on behalf of the nation he stands for. Treaties require congressional approval, yes. Since there is no war with Iran, this can\u2019t possibly be construed as one.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re involved here,\u201d Senator Benjamin Cardin, the ranking Democrat on Foreign Affairs, said Tuesday. \u201cWe have to be involved here.\u201d With due respect, Senator, no you aren\u2019t no you don\u2019t. This injects politics into foreign policy all right, but one can\u2019t call it democratic politics.\n\nIt\u2019s precisely the obvious politics attaching to the TPP, on the other hand, that\u2019s about to send Congress sprinting in the opposite direction.\n\nWhen Bill Clinton was out selling Americans NAFTA in the 1990s, they drank a lot of snake oil before they knew what it would do to them. It\u2019s not going to go down so easily this time, by all appearances. And it shouldn\u2019t.\n\nRelated: Will This Trade Deal Block Some Generic Drugs from the U.S.?\n\nNone of the TPP\u2019s provisions have been shared with American voters and few even with members of Congress. Many have been written by the corporations\u2014Big Pharma, Big Data, and so on\u2014the accord is supposed to govern.\n\nNow what? Congress abdicates on legislation it has had no hand in shaping? It comes down to take it or leave it? Isn\u2019t this exactly the gripe on the Iran deal?\n\nWho can be surprised that large constituencies are already preparing to gang up against the TPP? Trade unions worried about job flight, Greens opposed to American investment in developing countries too desperate for dough to impose labor and environmental regulation, and plain small \u201cd\u201d democrats are going to make this a divisive issue because, regrettably, they\u2019ve been served one.\n\nA few weeks ago, this column remarked on the German foreign ministry\u2019s new effort to involve his country in the policy process so that the nation\u2019s conduct abroad reflects their aspirations. Washington hurdles in the opposite direction, which is to say the wrong one.\n\nRelated: Democrats Square Off Over Trade Negotiating Bill\n\nIs that a domestic backlash out in the mists of the middle distance? Maybe. With more certainty I see another taking shape abroad.\n\nA day after the Senate committee voted, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, fairly seething, declared that his negotiators were talking to diplomats from P5 + 1\u2014the U.S., Britain, France, Germany, Russia, and China\u2014and no nation\u2019s legislators. He spoke for his country, of course.\n\nIf you think this view isn\u2019t shared in P5 +1, think again. They are all behind the accord and want to see the sanctions blocking trade and Iran\u2019s integration into the global community removed.\n\nTip this deal over and Congress will exacerbate already evident tensions with Europe over the Ukraine crisis and further sharpen animosities between Beijing and Washington, which are unnecessary to begin with.\n\nRelated: Tokyo, U.S. Report Progress on Trade Talks\n\nAs to the TPP, it shapes up as a miscalculation across the Pacific just as fast-track does at home.\n\nOne, we haven\u2019t heard yet from domestic constituencies in Asia that are sure to object. Two, China is pointedly excluded, which makes the TPP look like a wedding party without the betrothed. Beijing has simply proceeded apace with its own remake of trade relations in the region. Three, Washington has been working overtime to keep Russia out of the TPP organization. One gets the idea, but it has no chance of going well.\n\nRussia has a lot of Pacific frontage, and its interdependence with the region\u2019s economies is extensive and irreversible. Asians won\u2019t buy another round of U.S.-inspired hostility if they\u2019re asked to take an interest. And again, Moscow is already responding by stepping up its own ties in Asia\u2014not least with China, as widely reported. A good Congress would insist these questions be addressed.\n\nThere are very big side bets in the Iran deal and the trade pact across the Pacific. (And one with Europe is now in negotiation, with its own set of gambles.) The stakes are high, but you get the impression Congress doesn\u2019t even know how many chips are on the table, to say nothing of the risks.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "In a single week, two interesting Congressional bills caught my attention.", "title": "Obama\u2019s Deals with Cuba, Iran, TPP Split Congress", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2015/04/20/Obama-s-Deals-Cuba-Iran-TPP-Split-Congress", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/iran-summit_2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2015/04/20/Obama-s-Deals-Cuba-Iran-TPP-Split-Congress", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/iran-summit_2.jpg", "title": "The Fiscal Times", "card": "summary", "creator": "@psmith7600"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "In a single week, two interesting Congressional bills caught my attention.", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0943\"", "article_summary": "I argue strenuously for a foreign policy process subject to the electorate\u2019s wishes\u2014a politicized foreign policy, you can say.\nCongress wants in on a potentially historic foreign policy on Tuesday and wants out of another one two days later.\nThere are very big side bets in the Iran deal and the trade pact across the Pacific.\nThis injects politics into foreign policy all right, but one can\u2019t call it democratic politics.\nIsn\u2019t this exactly the gripe on the Iran deal?"}
