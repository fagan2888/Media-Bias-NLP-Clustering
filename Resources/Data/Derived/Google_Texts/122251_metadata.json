Actor Shirley MacLaine received the Lifetime Achievement Award at the Boulder International Film Festival on Saturday. For more photos and a video of MacLaine, go to www.dailycamera.com. Cliff Grassmick / February 15, 2014 ( Cliff Grassmick )\n\nBostwick reminded MacLaine that the last time she was in Boulder was September 1972 when she was stumping for the doomed presidential campaign of Democrat George McGovern. He produced a picture of a long-haired MacLaine that ran in the Daily Camera following that visit.\n\nAsked why she is not very active in politics these days, MacLaine said, in part that, \u201cSome of those politicians who think they should be our leaders should start looking within and getting more scientifically soulful and understand what leadership is really about and what future of the human race is really about.\u201d\n\nPeople lined up around the block in advance of the program.\n\nBroomfield resident Robin Bell said her primary focus at this year's festival was to attend documentary screenings and talk to filmmakers as part of the research for her Ph.D. dissertation, but seeing MacLaine was an excellent bonus.\n\n\u201cI love her,\u201d Bell said. \u201cI look at creativity and she's a creative mind. She thinks outside the box and doesn't worry about what other people think.\u201d\n\nCentennial resident Rhonda Hendrickson was part of a mass of fans lined up along the red carpet awaiting MacLaine's arrival in hope of obtaining an autograph before the event.\n\nShe got the signature and a moment of face time with the actress.\n\n\u201cI'm so excited,\u201d Hendrickson said. \u201cI told her, \u2018You just made my year,' and it put a big smile on her face.\u201d\n\nMacLaine hinted that she might like to return to the Boulder Theater to put on her one woman show.\n\nAfter accepting her career achievement award from the Boulder International Film Festival's founding sisters, Kathy and Robin Beeck, MacLaine said that over the course of her lifetime she had determined that \"nothing is more important than film.\"\n\n\"I had to be here for this and to tell you to keep going with your films,\" she said to an audience populated with filmmakers and film lovers. \"We do what we do because we love it but honestly, I don't think any of us have any idea how important even the smallest film is.\"\n\nThe festival wraps up its 10th year today.
