Dwightghost (CC BY 2.0)\n\nIn a rite of passage for some, more than a million Americans are arrested for drunk driving every year.\n\nThe Federal Bureau of Investigation says that 1.2 million motorists were arrested in the United States in 2011 for offenses ranging from misdemeanor \u201cbuzzed driving\u201d to vehicular homicide, presenting public health officials with a seemingly intransigent problem on the nation\u2019s roadways.\n\nNow, at least two developers are hoping to popularize mobile phone apps for measuring a user\u2019s blood alcohol content, or BAC. Based in Burlingame, Calif., Breathometer offers a mobile app for iPhones and Android smartphones that displays a user\u2019s BAC within seconds with a connected breathalyzer.\n\n\"People think, 'Oh, I'm driving around the corner,' but it's not until they get pulled over that they realize they're over the limit,\" Charles Michael Yim, the company\u2019s chief executive, told Reuters. Yim says the device may help to prevent drunk driving by allowing motorists to ascertain their BAC \u2014 given that alcohol itself impairs judgment about one\u2019s level of intoxication.\n\nBreathometer\u2019s version of the mobile breathalyzer connects via the mobile phone\u2019s headphone jack, whereas a competitor called BACtrack connects to the iPhone via Bluetooth. Although handheld breathalyzers are not generally considered accurate enough to serve as court-admissible evidence, the devices meet standards set by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration with its capacity to detect BAC with accuracy of 0.01 percent, the salesmen claim.\n\nAvailable on the market since the 1950s, breathalyzers were approved for personal use by U.S. regulators in 2001, when BACtrack, based in San Francisco, sold its first mouthpiece device for $150. The mobile phone connectivity is the next logical step, according to Yim \u2014 offering the ability to share one\u2019s BAC via Facebook or Twitter.\n\n\"We are catering to a completely different audience that wouldn't have considered buying one before,\" Yim said.\n\nThe device is about the size of a car key.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "breathometer, bactrack, mobile phone breathalzyer app, mobile breathalyzer app", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Developers hope that a breathalyzer mobile phone app may help to prevent drunk driving.", "title": "Mobile Breathalyzer Apps Allow Users To Test Blood Alcohol Level And Share On Social Media", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/mobile-breathalyzer-apps-breathometer-and-bactrack-allow-users-test-blood-alcohol-level-and-share", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/17/mobile-phone-app-offers-practical-breathalyzer-motorists.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Developers hope that a breathalyzer mobile phone app may help to prevent drunk driving.", "title": "Mobile Breathalyzer Apps Allow Users To Test Blood Alcohol Level And Share On Social Media", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/mobile-breathalyzer-apps-breathometer-and-bactrack-allow-users-test-blood-alcohol-level-and-share", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/17/mobile-phone-app-offers-practical-breathalyzer-motorists.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/17/mobile-phone-app-offers-practical-breathalyzer-motorists.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Consumer News", "published_time": "2013-09-17T12:03:49-04:00", "modified_time": "2013-09-17T12:03:47-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Developers hope that a breathalyzer mobile phone app may help to prevent drunk driving."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fccfda\"", "article_summary": "Developers hope that a breathalyzer mobile phone app may help to prevent drunk driving.\nNow, at least two developers are hoping to popularize mobile phone apps for measuring a user\u2019s blood alcohol content, or BAC.\nDwightghost (CC BY 2.0)In a rite of passage for some, more than a million Americans are arrested for drunk driving every year.\nBased in Burlingame, Calif., Breathometer offers a mobile app for iPhones and Android smartphones that displays a user\u2019s BAC within seconds with a connected breathalyzer.\nThe mobile phone connectivity is the next logical step, according to Yim \u2014 offering the ability to share one\u2019s BAC via Facebook or Twitter."}
