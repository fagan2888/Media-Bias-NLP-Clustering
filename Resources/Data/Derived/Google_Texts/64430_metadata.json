It dusted the floor and collected in the folds of the blue tarp on top of it. It was in his hair, too, and on a speaker system playing the dusky, plodding electronica of Darkside.\n\nIt ran up his forearms \u2014 strong, a climber\u2019s \u2014 and some even worked its way out the door of the garage that now plays host to rolls of fiberglass, electric hand planers, jerry-rigged sawhorses, and lots and lots of foam. The music was momentarily drowned out by the squeaky sound of a saw.\n\nThe glare from three severe photography lights bounced off his circular glasses as murky drops of epoxy resin dripped onto his feet. He noticed my gaze.\n\nRaja Badr-el-din, the short, squinting man standing before me in an unassuming pair of dark blue shorts, a plain teal T-shirt, and stained flip-flops, was not meant to be into surfboards.\n\n\u201cIn order to make surfboards,\u201d he says, \u201cyou\u2019ve got to commit a pair of shoes to the cause.\u201d\n\nHe has committed far more than that.\n\nHe was raised primarily in Jordan, a country blocked almost entirely from the Mediterranean Sea by Israel. Its one coastal town, Aqaba, and the 17 miles of Red Sea coastline around it are best known for being raided by T.E. Lawrence during the First World War. Water sports? Not so much.\n\nAfter graduating from high school he traveled to the United States to study physics at Stanford. It was any proud parents\u2019 dream, and his were certainly that. Despite the challenges of freshman year engineering classes, there was nothing to suggest he would be anything other than a well-crafted Stanford \u201ctechie\u201d ready to make his mark on Silicon Valley.\n\nAnd then he started making things.\n\nFirst came skateboards. He bought one and \u201calmost immediately had the urge to build my own.\u201d He started doing so in his dorm room. He transformed it into a tiny workshop and began pumping out the most stylish boards on campus. He sourced sustainable wood and decorated each with his distinctive artwork \u2014 a colorful and playful style that toys with the ancient Islamic form of geometric design.\n\nHe wanted to make the best skateboard he could. It took 28 tries.\n\nBy the 29th they bored him. Each was no longer better than the previous. Quite simply, he had figured them out. And then a group of friends took him surfing.\n\n\u201cWe went to Santa Cruz and I was instantly hooked. I was like, \u2018oh yeah, there\u2019s something here for me,\u2019\u201d he explains with the goofy grin he gets when talking about his favorite things.\n\nWhen Raja decides he likes something, he does it a lot. In high school, when it was art, he could spend entire summers holed up in his house, painting. His freshman year of college it was climbing, and he was at the climbing wall or bouldering in the Santa Cruz Mountains virtually every day. \u201cOnce I start I want to get it right,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of a slippery slope.\u201d\n\nNow the endearingly bumbling engineer had a new obsession: California\u2019s most iconic of all. But he was tired of renting boards, and his roommate was out of town.\n\n\u201cIf I want to get a surfboard why don\u2019t I just shape it? If I can build a skateboard I can build a surfboard.\u201d\n\n\u201cWrong.\u201d\n\nHe took advantage of his roommate\u2019s absence and the dorm room paid the price. Raja was introduced to foam.\n\n\u201cThe entire room was white. The floor was white, the walls were white. Foam was all over my roommate\u2019s computer. I was like, \u2018oh \u2026 can\u2019t be doing this in a dorm room.\u2019\u201d\n\nAnd the board was useless.\n\n\u201cThe rails were wonky. The volume was all off. The fins were really close together and weren\u2019t straight.\u201d He tells the story with only the tiniest hint of embarrassment. \u201cI don\u2019t think I ever stood up on that board.\u201d\n\nThere were a lot of problems. But to Raja, the solution was singular.\n\n\u201cI hadn\u2019t spent enough time around surfboards.\u201d\n\nAs Raja had come to realize, the creation of a surfboard is a complicated, messy process. It all begins with a big piece of foam. Its deformities must be removed with an electric planer. After that a template is placed on the foam and used to trace the outlines of the board a \u201cshaper\u201d wants to create. Raja designs his templates with a software program called AKU-Shaper.\n\nTemplates are what Raja calls \u201cthe secret weapon.\u201d He explains that \u201cif anyone gets the template they can just copy it.\u201d Accordingly, shapers are intensely protective of their templates, and to share one with another is a remarkable gesture of trust.\n\nIn most professional shops a board is only shaped once and then the dimensions are plugged into a machine that can recreate it. But Raja, who operates off three main templates, is constantly fiddling with his.\n\nWhy? \u201cOh, the tail was sliding out. Or it was too floaty. I could put bigger fins or make it more concave. There\u2019s always 100 ways to solve a problem.\u201d\n\nOnce the template is penciled out the foam is cut with a handsaw. Then the electric planer is brought out again, this time to level the foam, which starts at a universal thickness, to the proper distribution. Most boards should be fatter in the middle and grow thinner toward the ends.\n\nNext up for shaping is the rail, which is the phrase for the board\u2019s edges. There is a humor to the terminology of board shaping; though intensely scientific, it is rooted in slang. The rail, for example, must be \u201cfloaty\u201d enough, but also \u201cgrabby\u201d enough. It can\u2019t be too \u201cskatey\u201d or it might slide away from the wave.\n\nAfter the rail is shaped, the foam shavings are cleaned off. Graphics, if so desired \u2014 and for Raja they almost always are \u2014 are then airbrushed onto the foam, along with the board\u2019s dimensions and the shaper\u2019s signature. He places his logo on there too. Mauji Surfboards, Arabic for wave.\n\nAt this point there is a good-looking surfboard under the lights. And it\u2019s not yet halfway done.\n\nThe board could be shaped perfectly, but if put in the sea as it is now, it would be destroyed by the water and the salt. It needs to be fiberglassed.\n\nFiberglass in its virgin state comes in big rolls. Light plays on the silver surface as the sheet is laid across the board, making it shimmer in a lunar sort of way. It cut to the rough length and width of the board. Then things get messy. The next part requires gloves.\n\nEpoxy resin is mixed with a hardener \u2014 just the right balance or it will be useless by the time it gets on the board. Raja once used a poly resin instead of an epoxy. He doesn\u2019t anymore. \u201cYou smell it and feel like you\u2019re dying inside.\u201d\n\nThe mucus-like resin is then poured on the board and spread out evenly over the fiberglass. The fiberglass and resin step usually is repeated three times on each side. Though it may seem industrial compared to the art of shaping, Raja considers it the hardest part of the process. It\u2019s critical too \u2014 determining the flex, weight, and durability of the surfboard.\n\nRaja does all this nonchalantly, explaining his actions as he works. When he slips up he laughs, handles it, and moves on. He looks assured, and he should be \u2014 he\u2019s good. But he wasn\u2019t always.\n\nThe dorm room foam incident didn\u2019t put Raja off making surfboards. It just forced him to adapt.\n\nHe fiberglassed that first board in the courtyard of Stanford\u2019s political science building. \u201cIt was 12 at night. I had to wait not to attract too much attention.\u201d\n\nFiberglassing, he would learn the hard way, is something best done in an enclosed place. When the resin dried a host of unwelcome visitors, from flower petals to insects, clung to it. But he had nowhere else to go. So he kept working in courtyards, generally in a dubious sort of understanding with his dorm staff.\n\nThe fire marshal was less understanding.\n\n\u201cHe saw the board drying and the different resins.\u201d That was that. Raja was told to stop.\n\nAt Stanford, 97 percent of all undergraduates live on campus. The university guarantees housing for all four years and, given the Silicon Valley pricing of Palo Alto, students take them up on the offer.\n\nIn the middle of his junior year Raja moved to Redwood City.\n\nThe place he now shares there has all the accoutrement of a dorm room \u2014 pizza boxes, beer cans, bags of chips \u2014 and one other thing that he is willing to commute 15 miles to class for: a garage.\n\nThere are no flower petals in the garage. There are no bugs.\n\nRaja has only been at the house for a few months, but in that time he has filled it with surfboards. Some seem decorative \u2014 a wooden one in the corner, for instance \u2014 but most of them are just there. The residual of a man honing his craft.\n\nUnder meek grins and off-kilter glasses Raja is deadly serious about surfboards. But leaving campus to make them is not something everyone can easily understand.\n\nAt school he is seen by many as a sort of a lovable eccentric. Many students might be able to empathize with an obsessive sense of focus. But stories of people leaving campus to pursue something are more likely to include tech startups and huge amounts of money than chunks of foam.\n\nHis parents aren\u2019t sure about it either. But Raja has a deal with them as old as college itself. \u201cJust don\u2019t flunk out.\u201d\n\nLike most projects, though, this one costs money. Materials don\u2019t come cheap (about $250 for each board). Nor do tools.\n\nSuch is his perfectionism, Raja is hesitant to charge market prices for his boards. I ask how long until he will.\n\n\u201cFive years until I bump my price another 100 bucks.\u201d\n\nMy eyebrows rise. He smiles.\n\n\u201cAs far as not being able to blame anything on the tools, I\u2019m almost there.\u201d\n\nUp until now he has been able to fund most of the project with cash he has leftover from selling skateboards. He supplements that with money from his allowance. \u201cI buy my books or whatever and then spend the rest of it on surfboards.\u201d The allowance comes from his parents. And though they are all right with him shaping while he is in school, his wish to stay in Redwood City to do so through the summer left them less happy.\n\n\u201cThey see a hobby, I see a project. I\u2019m trying to perfect this craft.\u201d\n\nHe told me this at a greasy Denny\u2019s table in Pacifica, a beach town just south of San Francisco. Earlier that day he had taken me surfing.\n\nSurfing in Northern California is nothing like surfing down south in Laguna Beach or San Diego. The beach was fogged in, turning the water beneath it grey. A cold northerly wind picked up frigid drops of water from the crests of waves and whipped them across our faces.\n\nBut it was beautiful.\n\nSea lions poked their heads out of the water. Sea gulls dove into it. Yellow wildflowers lined the beach, and evergreens colored the hillsides around it with the reminder that this is not L.A, this is not Hawaii, this is Northern California and things are different here.\n\nWaves broke on inhospitably large slabs of rock that jutted out into the sea from both ends of the cove.\n\nRaja paddled out far ahead of me, and even though he had forgotten his glasses and could hardly see the waves in front of him, I couldn\u2019t keep up.\n\nWe chatted for a few minutes once I caught up to him, and then he grew very quiet. He had been so excited to get out there he considered two hours of traffic \u201cso, so worth it.\u201d Now he was totally tranquil.\n\nI had expected him to approach surfing the same way he approached shaping \u2014 with the precision and perfectionism of an engineer. But instead of chasing the perfect spot from which to catch a wave, instead of obsessing over the physics of the water, he seemed content to just sit there.\n\nThe meditative aspect of surfing is a tired clich\u00e9, but for Raja completely true. This was a special thing.\n\nHaving seen that, eating pancakes at Denny\u2019s, I understood the anxiety he has for the summer. It is not easy to love something with such limited career paths. And the summer is just a taste of what he will face after graduation.\n\nTaking a break from his Oreo shake he tells me, \u201cI\u2019m not focused on making the most high-performance board. I\u2019m focused on making the board that will make you most stoked to get in the water.\u201d\n\n\u201cRight now it\u2019s about being able to make enough money to pursue those challenges.\u201d\n\nAnd as he talks about the future I realize that he has no idea what it holds. Few do, I suppose, but the way he spends his time has highlighted the uncertainty of it in a very stark way.\n\nAfter all, he is in this country on a student visa. Without full employment or an American marriage, it will soon be \u201cgoodbye Pacifica.\u201d\n\nFocus can blot out doubt. When he is shaping, or when he catches a wave, Raja\u2019s problems are a light year away. Sitting in the water waiting for one they are less so. Yet in the quiet uncertainty of the moment he is happy.\n\nMaybe, for Raja, it\u2019s all about compromise. This summer certainly will be. He tells me that at his father\u2019s urging he has accepted a Silicon Valley-style internship.\n\nSurfing is not opposed to balance, after all. For every obsessive bum living out of a car there are beaches full of doctors and lawyers and engineers, and they all look the same in a wetsuit.\n\nFloating on his board, I think Raja understands that.\n\n\u201cBut the real goal this summer is in the garage.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Max Walker-Silverman,Raja Badr-el-din,Stanford Univeristy,surfboard maker,surfboards,surfing,Culture & Features,Features,Frontpage Featured,Parks & Recreation,Politics & Gov,Sports", "description": "Raja Badr-el-din moved from Jordan to pursue physics at Stanford.
