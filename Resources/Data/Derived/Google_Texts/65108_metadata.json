But he\u2019s convinced of one thing: It won\u2019t be a positive experience.\n\nFlamm, who operates one of the largest orchards in Illinois, is among a number of farmers who will be doing some extensive math to figure out how to manage his business now that the national healthcare act \u2014 often referred to as Obamacare \u2014 is being rolled out.\n\n\u201cI can already see how it\u2019s shaping up. It\u2019s not going to be good,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a nightmare. There will be tons of paperwork. I can see the whole thing blowing up in their face.\u201d\n\nPresident Obama\u2019s signature legislation, designed to provide health insurance for all Americans, has gotten off to a rocky start, with website problems greeting those attempting to sign up for the program. Those without employer-provided insurance must purchase policies from a network of providers, so-called health insurance marketplaces.\n\nSince many farmers are self-employed, they may be more likely to deal directly with the provisions of ACA. Others, such as Flamm, who have 50 or more employees, also must decide how to follow the law from the employer side.\n\nMargaret Vaughn, executive director of the Illinois Rural Health Association, said the impact of the legislation is still uncertain. Many people who will be most affected are in a holding pattern.\n\n\u201cMost farmers purchase their own private insurance, with the exception of those whose spouses work outside the farm in positions in which their employers provide health insurance which covers their family,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThere has not been an immediate impact has far as the ACA, but everyone is apprehensive about their future coverage and taking a wait-and-see approach at this point.\u201d\n\nAdam Nielsen, Illinois Farm Bureau\u2019s director of national legislation, agreed that it is too early to tell how Obamacare will affect farmers.\n\n\u201cMany people are calling their congressmen right now, and telling them they\u2019ve been canceled,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not aware of what the situation is with Illinois farmers. A lot of them have off-the-farm jobs or a spouse who works off the farm and is covered by somebody\u2019s plan.\n\n\u201cThousands, probably, have individual polices. How is it affecting them? I don\u2019t know. I wish I did.\u201d\n\nACA also will have major implications for Frey Produce in Keenes, one of the state\u2019s largest producers of fresh-market pumpkins. The Wayne County farm employs as many as 400 workers during the peak season, and though many are migrants with government guest worker permits, they are still counted as employees for purposes of the ACA.\n\nThat means that the business would have to pay fines of $2,800 per employee unless they are all offered a company policy. And because the new law requires a minimum coverage threshold, it would drastically increase costs for the company and the employees, according to owner Sarah Talley-Frey.\n\n\u201cIt would bankrupt our company to send that money for these workers working six months and less,\u201d she said\n\nThat may result in reducing hours for seasonal employees and hiring more, so that all fall under the 30-hour workweek that \u2014 under the law \u2014 is considered full time.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re trying to do now is reduce the contract time period that they\u2019re here for, bringing in a higher number of workers and rotating them out more quickly so that they stay under the threshold of being a part-time employee,\u201d Talley-Frey said. \u201cMost of these guys during the season are used to getting 60 hours a week. It cuts the amount of time you can give them to less than half.\u201d\n\nFlamm has considered the same thing, but there is a problem: the available workforce.\n\n\u201cI would consider that, but we\u2019re short-handed all the time anyway,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you\u2019ve got somebody willing to come to work, you want them there. We hardly have enough help to get the job done anyway.\u201d\n\nTalley-Frey said the law may make it more difficult to get good workers.\n\n\u201cI think that they\u2019re going to be discouraged because they expect to work the hours that are necessary in our industry,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate that this law exists. You\u2019re faced with taking time and energy and productivity away from what you\u2019re doing for a living.\u201d\n\nThe full-time, domestic employees at Frey Farms have employer-sponsored health insurance now, but probably won\u2019t a year from now.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll have to drop all our domestic employees because we will be faced with the fines for guest workers,\u201d Talley-Frey said.\n\nOne thing going for Flamm, Talley-Frey and other ag employers is that they have a year to figure out how to deal with the law. That\u2019s because the Obama administration granted a year\u2019s delay before the employer mandate takes effect.\n\n\u201cWe dodged the bullet for one year,\u201d Talley-Frey said. \u201cBut we\u2019re going to have to figure out a way to make it work.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Farming , Agriculture , Ag, Agri, AgriNews, Ag News, Agribusiness , Farm, Farm Policy, Farm Bill, Farmland , Farm Equipment, Field, Tractor, Combine, Planter, Corn , Soybeans, Fertilizer, Fungicide, Herbicide, Seed, Soil, Micronutrients, Commodity , Nitrogen, Rain, Drought , Resistant , Weed, Crop Insurance, GPS, Precision Agriculture, Wheat, Beef, Pork , Animal, Barn, GMO, Biotechnology , Grain, Grain Bins, Livestock, Rural, Tillage, Farm Land, Acreage, Trucks, Nutrient, Hybrids, Farmer, Auction, Machinery , Implements, Cultivators, USDA, Export, Calves, Pasture, Farm bill, Planters, No Till, Corn Stover , Stalks, Canopy , Taxes, Biofuels, Ethanol, Soy Diesel, Fuel, Consulting, Classifieds , AgriTrucker, Chemical, Finance, Sales, Insect, Weather, Stock, Farm Bill, Wind Farm, Secretary of Agriculture, Sprayers, Acre ,  ,  \r\nAgronomic ,  , Agronomy,  , Angus,  , Anhydrous,  , Bushel, ,   \r\nConservation,  , Forage, ,  Hog,  , Horticulture,  , Silage,  , Sow, , Steer, , Land Leasing, Communication, Homes for Sale, Cattle, Dairy, Swine, Chemical, Silos, Augers, Equipment, Sprayers, Hay, Irrigation, Feed", "og": {"image": "http://agrinews-pubs.com/Images/Images/10619.jpg"}, "description": "AgriNews covers topics that affect local farm families and their businesses in Illinois and Indiana.
