I will continue to love you and honor you all the days of my life,\u201d each one said.\n\nThey wore suits and sparkling dresses, rather than tuxedos and wedding gowns \u2014 and the words they spoke were familiar. To celebrate Valentine\u2019s Day at Seton Hall University yesterday, couples who had been married as recently as 2011 or for 30, 40 and even 50 years gathered to renew their vows in the opulent setting of the Chapel of the Immaculate Conception on the South Orange campus.\n\nAs they stood side-by-side in the chapel\u2019s pews during a special mass led by the Rev. Warren Hall, they kissed their brides and grooms, organ music played and bells rang. They joined in song and prayer and candles were lit.\n\nSome wore red shoes in deference to the holiday, which was further celebrated in a reception where couples\u2019 photos scrolled across a video screen and first dance songs, including the Carpenters\u2019 \u201cClose to you,\u201d made up the playlist.\n\nThat chapel is where Kimberly Capadona and Juan Trillo were married 10 years ago. They met at Seton Hall Law School and had their first date on Valentine\u2019s Day 2000 \u2014 which Capadona did not realize was a date at all.\n\nAfter attending a basketball game together, Trillo invited her out to dinner in SoHo, where a friend was a chef at a restaurant.\n\n\u201cI became very shy at that point,\u201d says Capadona, who describes herself mockingly as \u201can angry lawyer\u201d unused to talking about romance. \u201cWe were such good friends, we were out every weekend with all our friends together. It was a shock but a pleasant one.\u201d\n\nThey were engaged in 2003 and married the next year at their alma mater, where Capadona also received her undergraduate degree. They live together in Jersey City and are planning a trip back to Italy to relive their honeymoon for their tenth anniversary.\n\n\u201cMy husband is my very best friend,\u201d Capadona says, tearing up as she thinks about their bond.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s selfless, he\u2019s kind and you know he\u2019s just the type of person you want in your corner.\u201d\n\n\u201cI always look to my parents who have been married for over 40 years for inspiration,\u201d she adds. \u201cThey\u2019re in love today and I always wanted that for myself.\u201d\n\nBetsey and Matt Sheprow of Sea Girt serve as a reminder that Valentine\u2019s Day can be a time to cherish all relationships, not just romantic ones. They coordinated with six other couples, with whom they have stayed friends since their college days in the 70s, to attend the event.\n\n\u201cWe forged this beautiful friendship and here we are 40 years later,\u201d Betsey says. \u201cWe lived together after college, we were in each others weddings, buried parents, celebrated births.\u201d\n\n\u201cNow we celebrate our childrens\u2019 weddings together.\u201d\n\nMarie and George Kalosieh have just that kind of long-term relationship that inspires couples like Capadona and Trillo and the Sheprows. This year, they celebrate their 50th anniversary.\n\nGeorge has just one Valentine\u2019s Day wish for his wife. \u201cI hope the next 50 are as good as the last 50,\u201d he says.\n\nRELATED COVERAGE\n\n\u2022 Valentine's Day in NJ: 10 restaurants with special menus, seating still available\n\n\u2022 Snow storm leaves florists feeling unloved ahead of Valentine's Day", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "Description": "To celebrate Valentine's Day at Seton Hall University yesterday, couples who had been married as recently as 2011 or for 30, 40 and even 50 years gathered to renew their vows in the opulent setting of the Chapel of the Immaculate Conception", "title": "Couples renew vows for Valentine's Day at Seton Hall", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Couples renew vows for Valentine\\u0027s Day at Seton Hall\", \"link\": \"http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2014/02/couples_renew_vows_for_valentines_day_at_seton_hall.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://imgick.nj.com/home/njo-media/width620/img/star-ledger/photo/2014/02/14282014-large.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"12209900\", \"pub_date\": \"2014-02-15T15:00:03Z\", \"author\": \"Ronni Reich | The Star-Ledger\", \"tags\": [] }", "twitter": {"image": "http://media.nj.com/star-ledger/photo/2014/02/14282014-small.jpg", "creator": "@RonniReich", "site": "@njdotcom", "card": "summary", "description": "To celebrate Valentine's Day at Seton Hall University yesterday, couples who had been married as recently as 2011 or for 30, 40 and even 50 years gathered to renew their vows in the opulent setting of the Chapel of the Immaculate Conception"}, "article_date_updated": "Saturday, February 15, 2014, 10:00 AM", "parsely-metadata": "{\"image_url\": \"http://media.nj.com/star-ledger/photo/2014/02/14282014-large.jpg\", \"author_name\": \"rreich\", \"author_nickname\": \"Ronni Reich | The Star-Ledger\", \"author_id\": \"5942\", \"source_blog_name\": \"New Jersey Real-Time News\", \"source_blog_url\": \"http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/\", \"sponsored_content\": \"0\" }", "og": {"site_name": "NJ.com", "description": "To celebrate Valentine's Day at Seton Hall University yesterday, couples who had been married as recently as 2011 or for 30, 40 and even 50 years gathered to renew their vows in the opulent setting of the Chapel of the Immaculate Conception", "title": "Couples renew vows for Valentine's Day at Seton Hall", "url": "http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2014/02/couples_renew_vows_for_valentines_day_at_seton_hall.html", "image": "http://media.nj.com/design/alpha/img/logo_njo.gif", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "NJ.com", "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Saturday, February 15, 2014, 10:00 AM", "article_author": "Ronni Reich | The Star-Ledger"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd417b\"", "article_summary": "RELATED COVERAGE\u2022 Valentine's Day in NJ: 10 restaurants with special menus, seating still available\u2022 Snow storm leaves florists feeling unloved ahead of Valentine's Day\nThey met at Seton Hall Law School and had their first date on Valentine\u2019s Day 2000 \u2014 which Capadona did not realize was a date at all.\nGeorge has just one Valentine\u2019s Day wish for his wife.\nTo celebrate Valentine\u2019s Day at Seton Hall University yesterday, couples who had been married as recently as 2011 or for 30, 40 and even 50 years gathered to renew their vows in the opulent setting of the Chapel of the Immaculate Conception on the South Orange campus.\n\u201cWe were such good friends, we were out every weekend with all our friends together."}
