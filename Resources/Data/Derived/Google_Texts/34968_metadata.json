Most of the benefits will be offered with no minimum participation requirements, which is unusual.\n\nThe benefits package will be consolidated into one bill for the employer as well as a breakdown on how much should be deducted from an employee\u2019s paycheck \u2013 which should save small business the administrative overhead, and headaches.\n\n\u201cThe goal of our exchange is to help ease the burden of employee health benefits administration and give employees more options for supplemental products,\u201d said BIA president Jim Roche.\n\nThe BIA will be working with CieloStar, a national payments and benefits technology company based in Minneapolis. Thus far, Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield in New Hampshire and Northeast Delta Dental have signed up to participate on the BIA exchange, and Minuteman Health is expected to join in the next few weeks.\n\nAlthough the BIA calls its offering a \u201cprivate healthcare exchange\u201d it is not to be confused with the public individual exchange or the SHOP exchange for groups offered through the Affordable Care Act.\n\nEmployees will not be able to choose a health insurance company, just choose from among the plans offered by the single insurer that the employer agreed to. And it will be up to the employer to choose how many of the 24 plans offered by Anthem it will offer their employees.\n\nAlthough an employer can do this without a broker, the site has a broker option right on its home page.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s meant to be broker-friendly,\u201d said Roche. In many cases, it would be the broker who would go onto the site on behalf of the employer.\u201d\n\nRoche said the BIA has held meetings with brokers in Concord, Portsmouth and Manchester \u2013 about 50 in all \u2013 but has yet to contact the NH Association of Insurance Agents, which declined to comment on the new initiative.\n\n\u201cWe are not displacing any brokers,\u201d said Paul Walther, chief marketer for CieloStar. \u201cThey can bring their own clients \u2013 we even set up a dashboard for them. It\u2019s not our intention to be the broker of record. We really want to work with them.\u201d\n\nBoth Roche and Walther said that they will be reaching out to more brokers in the coming weeks.", "article_metadata": {"fb": {"app_id": 357619467597909}, "description": "Goal is \u2018more options\u2019 for employees, employers", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "BIA launches private health, benefits exchangeGoal is \u2018more options\u2019 for employees, employersBy Bob SandersThe Business and Industry Association of NH is offering a sort of virtual benefits agency that is not meant to replace brokers but enhance them.\n\u201cThe goal of our exchange is to help ease the burden of employee health benefits administration and give employees more options for supplemental products,\u201d said BIA president Jim Roche.\nAlthough the BIA calls its offering a \u201cprivate healthcare exchange\u201d it is not to be confused with the public individual exchange or the SHOP exchange for groups offered through the Affordable Care Act.\nThus far, Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield in New Hampshire and Northeast Delta Dental have signed up to participate on the BIA exchange, and Minuteman Health is expected to join in the next few weeks.\nThe BIA will be working with CieloStar, a national payments and benefits technology company based in Minneapolis."}
