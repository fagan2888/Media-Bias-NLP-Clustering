We want to hear how he\u2019s changed his ways.\u201d\n\nThe pastor, a frequent preacher in prisons across the state, speaks first.\n\nWashington, who has served 12 years of a 20-year sentence for second-degree assault, has found peace in religion, the pastor says.\n\nWashington is the worship leader in the prison ministry. Before that, he completed drug treatment programs to kick the habit that has helped make him a repeat offender.\n\nNext up is Washington\u2019s forgiving wife, Carla.\n\nShe believes so much in her husband that she literally married him in prison, at a chapel there.\n\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t take marriage lightly,\u201d Carla says softly, but not ashamedly. \u201cI wanted to make sure he\u2019d changed his ways. He has. That\u2019s why I married him.\u201d\n\nCarla adds that Washington, if granted parole, would leave prison for a stable place. Her job at Mercedes-Benz can pay the bills to start, and near her Birmingham home, there\u2019s a church where Washington can volunteer.\n\nAs with most hearings inside an oversized room at the Montgomery headquarters of the state Board of Pardons and Paroles, there is no one here to oppose the parole. The prisoner is nowhere to be seen, either.\n\nIn Alabama, prisoners cannot be present to hear their fate, though the general public can attend. Besides his supporters and a reporter for The Daily Signal, there is no audience at Washington\u2019s hearing.\n\nAfter about 90 seconds of testimony, it\u2019s time to deliberate. The choice to free someone happens fast, and the board will preside over 80 or so cases today and upward of 7,000 this year.\n\nWalker and the two other board members huddle over the file detailing the prisoner\u2019s background.\n\nThey will decide Washington\u2019s fate right here, right now, without ever speaking to him or conferring with each other before this hearing.\n\nThe verdict: parole granted. The decision is unanimous, as usual.\n\n\u201cHallelujah,\u201d the pastor exclaims. Carla bows her head, thankful that she has the chance to get to know the man she married.\n\nUnusual Case\n\nJohnny Washington is one of the lucky ones.\n\nIn Alabama, the parole approval rate dropped from 43 percent in 2008 to 30 percent in 2013.\n\nThe seasoned, governor-appointed members of the parole board have a simple explanation for this.\n\nThey say recent reforms to the front end of the criminal justice system\u2014meant to keep more nonviolent offenders out of prison\u2014have left them fewer parole-worthy candidates.\n\nSo the board is forced to consider prisoners such as Kirk Chandler, convicted of sodomizing a young girl\u2014she attended his recent parole hearing all grown up, but still shattered\u2014and Tommy Boldin, convicted of murdering a man and nearly killing the responding police officer.\n\nThe board denied parole for both men on the same Wednesday in late June that they granted freedom to Washington.\n\n\u201cYou cannot outrun what happened in the past,\u201d veteran board member Robert Longshore tells The Daily Signal.\n\n\u201cThat got you to where you are. Some things you can\u2019t outrun ever.\u201d\n\nViolent inmates like these would not benefit much from Alabama\u2019s plan to ease its overcrowded prisons.\n\nRather, the bipartisan criminal justice reform legislation\u2014passed by state lawmakers in May but still awaiting funding\u2014would make changes designed to push the board to free more borderline prisoners. These men and women normally would be good candidates for early release in a resource-rich probation and parole system.\n\nAlabama is far from normal.\n\nOutside experts who have studied Alabama\u2019s parole history believe that the drop in paroles is owed to problems at the back end of the criminal justice system.\n\nThese observers say the parole board\u2019s decisions are influenced by the fact that if they vote to let a prisoner go, there aren\u2019t enough parole officers to properly supervise the inmate\u2019s re-entry into society.\n\nOverwhelmed probation and parole officers currently have caseloads of 200 inmates each (70 would be ideal, officers tell The Daily Signal).\n\nThe budget of the Board of Pardons and Paroles has shrunk about 30 percent since 2009.\n\nWith less attention applied to helping offenders stay sober and find drugs and housing, the odds are good they will commit another crime.\n\n\u201cThe function of parole academically and traditionally has been the protection of society through the rehabilitation of the offender,\u201d says Longshore, who has deliberated over Alabama parole cases for a decade. \u201cBut austerity budgeting for parole has changed the philosophy from one of supervision to [one of] surveillance.\u201d\n\n\u2018Not Functional at All\u2019\n\nElizabeth Planer and fellow probation and parole officers, squished into their trailer-sized Montgomery field office, say they want to do more.\n\n\u201cWe should be here to help provide assistance and empower,\u201d Planer explains.\n\nPlaner is the senior parole officer here, and her staff of 12 supervises more than 2,500 offenders. She says:\n\nIf I am supervising 200 people, I don\u2019t have time to help provide assistance and empower. I have time to write reports\u2014when they mess up. It\u2019s not proactive, it\u2019s very reactive. I am not saying we can cure everybody. But under the situation we are in now, we are not functional at all.\n\nOfficers such as Planer, who wear plainclothes but carry a badge and gun, have powers beyond the authority to arrest.\n\nTheir duties also require them to do pre-sentence investigations for every felony case that comes through Montgomery County circuit court.\n\nConsidered neutral parties, parole and probation officers compile information such as an accused offender\u2019s arrest history and personal background, and legal details surrounding the case. They then recommend how a judge should sentence the person.\n\nSteven Todd Hudson, in his seventh year as a Montgomery probation officer, says he conducts 15 to 20 pre-sentence investigations per month.\n\nThat number is high, Hudson shares proudly\u2014although it\u2019s not a matter of choice, because for the past two years, he has had to handle all of the cases that enter Circuit Court Judge William Shashy\u2019s courtroom. Typically, if staffing levels were what is considered appropriate, two officers would be assigned to each of six courtrooms in the county.\n\nBut perks come with the exclusivity of short staffing. Hudson says Shashy signs off on 98 percent of \u201cwhat I want.\u201d\n\nLike any parole and probation officer, Hudson wants the offenders he sees to succeed. Prison is failure.\n\nIf he has to revoke parole or probation and send someone to prison, which he says is rare, he takes it personally.\n\n\u201cIf they do end up in prison, I tell them it\u2019s because you put yourself there,\u201d Hudson says.\n\n\u201cShashy is a really great judge because he will give you every option before prison.\u201d\n\nAlthough Hudson and Shashy have made a successful team, they aren\u2019t keeping enough people from entering\u2014and returning to\u2014prison.\n\nIn fiscal year 2013, 40 percent of Alabama\u2019s admissions to prison were violators of parole or probation, many for \u201ctechnical\u201d reasons such as missing an appointment with an officer, according to data compiled by the Council of State Governments.\n\nOfficers in part attribute that number to themselves. Short-staffed, they can supervise only in name.\n\nBeverly Gilder, another Montgomery-based probation and parole officer, says she is able to spend only five to 10 minutes with each of the roughly 50 offenders she sees per day.\n\nObtaining employment is a requirement of supervision. Right now, Gilder hands inmates a printout listing the companies and other employers that will hire convicted felons.\n\nMontgomery\u2019s chicken plants are known to hire ex-offenders. Automobile suppliers, trucking companies and restaurants also welcome those seeking second chances.\n\nBut Gilder and her fellow officers don\u2019t have the time to open doors. As Planer says:\n\nWhen you come out of prison you are coming out in debt, with nothing, and out into an environment that is just negative all the way around. You are setting them up for failure if you are not giving them a chance.\n\n\u2018Job to Help\u2019\n\nSupervision has to be adequate for parole to pay off, officers say.\n\nParole is unique in that those who are freed before the end of their sentence automatically are subjected to supervision in the community.\n\nThe parole board sets release terms, such as determining how often the offender must meet with a parole officer, and whether the offender must get treatment for drug or alcohol issues.\n\nIn Alabama, unless an offender is sentenced to death or life without parole, he or she gets a parole date within 15 years. If the inmate loses his chance at parole the first time, the case is reviewed again every one to five years.\n\nBut those continually denied parole\u2014presumably because they\u2019ve been deemed too dangerous to release\u2014eventually serve their full sentence and are released with no supervision or conditions.\n\nAround half of the inmates under the Alabama parole board\u2019s jurisdiction complete their sentences in prison before being released without supervision.\n\nNationally, in 2012, one in five state inmates was released from prison without supervision.\n\nThe heart of the Alabama\u2019s reform effort tries to encourage the board to grant more parole.\n\nThe new law provides money to hire 100 more parole and probation officers. As of July 30, the state employed 237.\n\nThe law also forces the parole board to create guidelines, based on best practices and scientific research, that inform its decisions on whether to grant parole.\n\n\u201cThe state hasn\u2019t ever really done any meaningful analysis to find out what works with community supervision,\u201d says Bennet Wright, director of the Alabama Sentencing Commission. \u201cThis really is the next wave of criminal justice reform.\u201d\n\nThe guidelines, as described in the legislation, should \u201cpromote the use of prison space for the most violent and greatest risk offenders\u201d but \u201cnot create a right or expectation by a prisoner to parole.\u201d\n\nCurrently, Alabama\u2019s parole board members don\u2019t have to disclose the reasons they reject parole. That would change under the new reform. The idea is to heighten scrutiny of the board\u2019s decisions.\n\nIn Alabama and 23 other states, parole board files\u2014including disciplinary records and other documents related to an offender\u2019s case\u2014are sealed from the public, according to The Marshall Project.\n\nAnother reform encourages the use of guidelines for how much time and effort officers should spend with each probationer and parolee.\n\nWhen deciding the amount of attention to give, officers will be required to apply a risk-needs assessment focused less on the severity of the crime and more on the offender\u2019s likelihood of breaking the law again.\n\nBefore passage of the criminal justice legislation, Alabama\u2019s probation and parole agency already had been training officers with a tool originating in Ohio that has been adopted in other southern states. This system takes into account an offender\u2019s socioeconomic background, peer groups, family support and job prospects when determining his or her needs.\n\n\u201cThe problem with the way we supervise you now\u2014based on your offense\u2014is that it takes into account absolutely nothing about you as a person,\u201d Planer says, adding:\n\nBelieve it or not, most of my murderers are my best people. Most of them don\u2019t have any issues because they took care of their issue when they killed their issue. If we follow the idea that people are capable of change, then you can\u2019t only judge them based on the one crime.\n\nUnder the changes, those adjusting more slowly to the outside world will be punished less harshly for violating terms of parole.\n\nInstead of returning to prison, offenders who commit technical violations of probation and parole will endure short jail stays followed by continued supervision.\n\nIf they stay out of trouble, the reward can be great: The new law allows for early termination of parole for offenders considered low-risk.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want them in prison,\u201d Hudson says. \u201cMy job is to help them. I\u2019m here to make sure they are enjoying their freedom, spending time with their friends and family and doing the right thing.\u201d\n\nA Chance at Parole\n\nThe goal of parole is to reward those who are doing well.\n\nValerie Harris is living the incarcerated life better than most.\n\nHarris, 39, spends the time before her March 1, 2016, parole hearing at an alternative prison that declares that its mission is to \u201cbreak the cycle of recidivism.\u201d\n\nFree to dress in everywoman clothes, she serves her life sentence amid positive messaging and ample opportunity.\n\nThe halls of the privately run prison, called Alabama Therapeutic Education Facility, are lined with spanking clean white walls.\n\nFramed quotations, affixed to the walls every which way, are unavoidable:\n\n\u201cRISK BEING OPTIMISTIC.\u201d\n\n\u201cHAVING A BAD LIFE? CHANGE IT.\u201d\n\n\u201cSTICK WITH THE WINNERS.\u201d\n\nLately, Harris is behaving as if she has gotten the message.\n\nIn the unusual world of this medium-security prison, inmates (or residents, as officials call them) are able to govern themselves in a \u201crotated chain-of-command\u201d structure.\n\nHarris started at the bottom, as a \u201cservice crew\u201d member. She has risen to become \u201csenior coordinator,\u201d the top of the top.\n\nTo get there, she successfully completed a class to combat substance abuse.\n\nShe\u2019s taking a heat and ventilation class, with hopes of developing carpentry skills that will make her employable if she ever again sees the real world.\n\nShe\u2019s writing a business plan, to provide the blueprint for the nonprofit she hopes to start so she can help troubled teens.\n\nIn casual conversations, Harris uses textbook words such as \u201crecidivism.\u201d She recalls unprompted how states, and the federal government, are reforming the criminal justice system to help people like her.\n\n\u201cI have to stay up on the law,\u201d Harris says. \u201cI\u2019d be stupid not to, considering my case.\u201d\n\nCase Study\n\nHarris\u2019s case\u2014despite her seemingly uplifting circumstances\u2014is not all that it seems.\n\nIn 2006, she was sentenced to life in prison, with the opportunity for parole, under Alabama\u2019s tough three-strikes law officially called the Habitual Felony Offender Act.\n\nExperts in large part blame the law, passed when nationwide fear over repeat offenders was high, for Alabama\u2019s severely overcrowded prisons.\n\nIf you are convicted of a felony, the statute imposes additional prison time for prior felony convictions.\n\nThe offense Harris received a life sentence for, a conviction for trafficking cocaine, was not enough by itself to put her away for that long.\n\nIn fact, because she was convicted of selling such a small amount of cocaine\u2014more than 28 grams but less than 500\u2014under Alabama law, she would have been sentenced to a minimum of three years in prison.\n\nBut this was not her first offense, so Harris wasn\u2019t sentenced based on that crime alone. She already had been convicted for drug possession in both 1997 and 2002 and was sentenced to probation each time.\n\nBecause her 2006 trafficking offense is considered the most serious type of felony (Class A), the habitual offender statute required Harris to be punished more harshly because of the prior convictions\u2014no matter how minor.\n\n\u201cI certainly believe I would have imposed a more appropriate sentence under the circumstances of her case if our law had given me that discretion,\u201d says Teresa Pulliam, the Jefferson County Circuit Court judge who sentenced Harris on the drug trafficking conviction.\n\nHarris has had chances to overcome her tough sentence.\n\nAccording to Eddie Cook, the Alabama Board of Pardons and Parole\u2019s assistant director, Harris won parole twice before (in 2009 and 2013).\n\nBut once outside the confines of prison, she picked up a new drug charge.\n\nShe most recently was sent back to prison in March 2014.\n\nIn September, good behavior helped Harris get transferred from a maximum-security prison known for toxic conditions to the relative comforts of Alabama Therapeutic Education Facility.\n\nThe 381 residents staying here have been hand-selected by the Department of Corrections.\n\nAs she awaits yet another parole opportunity, Harris says she better appreciates the costs of her actions\u2014and all that she\u2019s lost.\n\nHarris lost her mom seven months ago. Harris was incarcerated during her mother\u2019s last days.\n\nShe got a tattoo of her mother\u2019s name, Annie, on her right forearm as a way to overcome the death.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not mad about where I am,\u201d says Harris, whose dark hair is showing gray strands. \u201cI feel like this was the hand I was dealt.\u201d\n\n\u2018Every Angle\u2019 to Free\n\nExperts say that under the new guidelines for the parole board, a case such as Harris\u2019s would be scrutinized for what it is\u2014not for what it was.\n\n\u201cUnder the guidelines, they will look at the totality of a person\u2019s case to determine if he or she is a good candidate for parole,\u201d says Andy Barbee, a research manager with the Council of State Governments, an outside group that helped Alabama enact its reforms.\n\nBarbee explains:\n\nThe length of a person\u2019s sentence\u2014and the sticker shock of that\u2014will not drive the decision. It\u2019s more about addressing things that relate to recidivism. \u2018Is the person getting programming? Have they developed new skills? Do they have a reentry plan?\u2019 They will be evaluated on a level assessment field.\n\nParole board members are more circumspect.\n\nIn interviews, the three men welcome the changes but reject the idea that the reform will alter how they do their job.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s what we already do now put in writing,\u201d says William Wynne Jr., who is in his eighth year on the board. \u201cWe will just memorialize our thought process.\u201d\n\nThe board members say they already take a comprehensive view of a case\u2014and look beyond the offense itself.\n\nDuring a reporter\u2019s attendance of a day of hearings, Walker, the normally cerebral chairman, pushes back at the grandmother of Alonzo Smith, who has just been denied parole.\n\nSmith is incarcerated for attempted murder, but that\u2019s not the problem, Walker tells his grandmother:\n\nWe are not letting him stay in prison. He\u2019s letting himself stay. He\u2019s been out of control even in prison. We look for every angle to let people out. The key is in his hands.\n\nWhen the board does deny parole, as in Smith\u2019s case, members insist they go out of their way to explain their reasoning\u2014even though they don\u2019t have to make that information public.\n\n\u201cBoards in the past\u2014and I\u2019m not being judgmental of prior parole boards\u2014just sat here, listened to the testimony, made a ruling, and said go and get on out of here,\u201d Longshore says.\n\n\u201cThis board feels for this process to mean anything we have to put something out there,\u201d he says. \u201cWe could not be clearer in how we do that now. But if they want to memorialize that process, we have no objection whatsoever.\u201d\n\nThe three board members acknowledge that the extra resources on the outside will push them to free more inmates. Longshore says:\n\nI can tell you why this whole thing will lead to more paroles. If we have more parole officers who can adequately supervise offenders, who can make sure they are in programs, marginal cases are more likely to be paroled. I can guarantee we will parole more people.\n\nWaiting for \u2018Lucky Day\u2019\n\nBack at Alabama Therapeutic Educational Facility, inmates can taste freedom but aren\u2019t there yet.\n\nFive-on-five hoops games and bouts of wall ball make the prison feel alive.\n\nIn a classroom decorated with the faces of presidents and birthday wishes written in magic marker, residents study for the GED, the next step in a life that hasn\u2019t followed the normal steps.\n\nA spacious, female-only, dorm-style room with eight neatly made beds and a private bathroom feels close to home. But a cat-themed calendar on the wall counts down the days to the real thing.\n\nValerie Harris, after blowing her previous chances at freedom, may get another chance.\n\nHarris says she regrets \u201cbeing selfish\u201d and taking her freedom \u201cfor granted.\u201d\n\nIf she\u2019s truly changed, another shot at parole will allow her to prove it.\n\n\u201cWe believe in rehabilitation; we believe in redemption,\u201d Longshore says. \u201cIf they go in there and do good things, they are a good parole prospect.\u201d\n\nAnd if she\u2019s not there yet, Harris says, it means she hasn\u2019t earned it.\n\n\u201cIf I don\u2019t make parole, it just means I have a little more room for growth,\u201d Harris says. \u201cI would see it as, \u2018It\u2019s just not my time.\u2019 Hey, I may be lucky one day. I still have a chance. I just can\u2019t give up.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "In part three of a series, we examine how a criminal justice reform plan in Alabama would encourage the state's parole board to free more prisoners early.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "In part three of a series, we examine how a criminal justice reform plan in Alabama would encourage the state's parole board to free more prisoners early.", "title": "Why 3 Powerful Men Will Parole More Prisoners in Alabama", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/Ala.Part-3-Feature.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-08-14T09:24:45+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1NcN9BC"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "In part three of a series, we examine how a criminal justice reform plan in Alabama would encourage the state's parole board to free more prisoners early.", "title": "Why 3 Powerful Men Will Parole More Prisoners in Alabama", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/Ala.Part-3-Feature.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Featured Topics", "tag": "crime", "published_time": "2015-08-10T03:01:30+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-08-14T09:24:45+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Alabama, criminal justice reform, parole board, prison reform, Habitual Offender Act, Mandatory Minimum, State Council of Governments, Cliff Walker"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc9f0\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThe function of parole academically and traditionally has been the protection of society through the rehabilitation of the offender,\u201d says Longshore, who has deliberated over Alabama parole cases for a decade.\nThe seasoned, governor-appointed members of the parole board have a simple explanation for this.\nAround half of the inmates under the Alabama parole board\u2019s jurisdiction complete their sentences in prison before being released without supervision.\nAccording to Eddie Cook, the Alabama Board of Pardons and Parole\u2019s assistant director, Harris won parole twice before (in 2009 and 2013).\nThe board denied parole for both men on the same Wednesday in late June that they granted freedom to Washington."}
