The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration’s (SAMHSA) Center for Substance Abuse Prevention (CSAP) has issued a funding opportunity announcement under its fiscal year 2015 Minority Serving Institutions (MSIs) Partnerships with Community-Based Organizations (CBOs) grants. Known by its short title “MSI CBO grants,” the purpose of this program is to prevent and reduce substance abuse and transmission of both HIV and hepatitis C virus (HCV) among at-risk young adults (ages 18-24), including African Americans, Hispanics/Latinos, Asian Americans/Pacific Islanders, and American Indians/Alaska Natives. The program seeks to address behavioral health disparities among racial and ethnic minorities by encouraging the implementation of strategies to decrease the differences in access, service utilization and outcomes among the racial and ethnic minority populations served.

To meet the needs of the program’s target populations, CSAP expects MSIs to partner with one or more CBOs to provide integrated substance abuse, HCV, and HIV prevention programs. Eligible MSIs include Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), Hispanic Serving Institutions (HSIs), Asian American and Native American Pacific Islander-Serving Institutions (AANAPISIs), and Tribal Colleges and Universities (TCUs).

With $10.5 million in funding available, up to 35 three-year projects will be awarded. Applications are due May 26, 2015. Read more about this funding opportunity at SAMHSA’s website.
