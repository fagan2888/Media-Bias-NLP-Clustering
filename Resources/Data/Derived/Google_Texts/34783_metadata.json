He is now a member of the judgment chamber.\n\nHe could not immediately be reached for comment.\n\nFigueredo, 83, was one of the seven officials arrested in Zurich in May in the incident which put the FIFA crisis in the spotlight.\n\nHe was extradited to Uruguay in December and faces charges of money laundering and taking kickbacks to sell media and marketing rights for football tournaments and matches across the Americas.\n\nUruguayan prosecutors said in February that Figueredo had agreed to hand over more than $10 million in stocks and property in a deal to reduce his punishment.\n\n(Editing by Andrew Roche)", "article_metadata": {"description": "FIFA ethics committee investigates one of its own members - Reuters News:     By Brian Homewood    .05/27/2016 8:54:13AM EST.", "author": "Reuters News", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "By Brian Homewood    ZURICH(Reuters) - A member of", "title": "Reuters News - FIFA ethics committee investigates one of its own members", "url": "http://townhall.com/news/politics-elections/2016/04/03/fifa-ethics-committee-investigates-one-of-its-own-members-n2142971", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/_townhall/resources/images/thog.png", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "By Brian Homewood    ZURICH(Reuters) - A member of", "title": "Reuters News - FIFA ethics committee investigates one of its own members", "url": "http://townhall.com/news/politics-elections/2016/04/03/fifa-ethics-committee-investigates-one-of-its-own-members-n2142971", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/_townhall/resources/images/thog.png", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "FIFA ethics committee investigates one of its own members, Reuters News, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "FIFA is trying to rebuild itself after an unprecedented crisis which has seen several dozen soccer officials, many of them former FIFA officials, indicted in the United States.\nThe ethics committee itself has investigated and banned a number of leading officials for unethical conduct, including former FIFA president Sepp Blatter and European soccer boss Michel Platini.\nBy Brian HomewoodZURICH(Reuters) - A member of the ethics committee responsible for rooting out corruption in soccer's governing body FIFA has himself been placed under a preliminary investigation, the watchdog said on Sunday.\nThe committee statement came after media reports said that possible links between the two had been revealed by documents among the so-called Panama Papers, a huge leak of data from Panama-based law firm Mossack Fonseca.\n\"Dr Borbely is currently looking into said allegations in order to determine if there is a breach against the FIFA Code of Ethics and decide any further measures.\""}
