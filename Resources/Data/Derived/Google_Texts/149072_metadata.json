The OSC noted that a similar case is pending with The Merit Systems Protection Board.\n\nThe VA last month agreed to settle the clerk\u2019s complaint and reinstate him with back pay and compensatory damages for emotional distress. His first day back on the job was Tuesday.\n\nFrink, who worked as a GS-5 time-and-leave clerk in the Baltimore Regional Office of the Veterans Benefits Administration, had asked the VA to update his service-connected disability payments file to add his child as a beneficiary. But the department could not locate his file after he arrived at the Baltimore office in February 2013.\n\nIn frustration, Frink wrote to Sen. Barbara Mikulski, D-Md., who forwarded questions to the VA\u2019s Baltimore office, which \u201cwas under scrutiny for the way it was processing veterans\u2019 benefits claims,\u201d the special counsel\u2019s office said. Within two weeks, VA managers discussed firing Frink \u201calthough no concerns had previously been documented regarding his performance,\u201d the OSC report said. He was terminated on July 12, 2013, before his probationary period ended.\n\nInvestigators determined that \u201cthe VA\u2019s allegations about Mr. Frink lacked evidentiary support; management\u2019s testimony was inconsistent and lacked candor; other witnesses did not corroborate the agency\u2019s version of the events; and termination was an excessive penalty for the alleged misconduct.\u201d Further, OSC found, \u201cone of the VA officials involved in Mr. Frink\u2019s termination showed animus, and all three officials involved had a clear motive to retaliate against him.\u201d OSC recommended disciplinary action against two of Frink\u2019s supervisors.\n\n\u201cThe constitutional right to petition Congress must be guaranteed for all Americans,\u201d said Special Counsel Carolyn Lerner, who is citing the case as an opportunity for all agency managers to better understand prohibited personnel practices. \u201cFederal agencies cannot deny their employees this right even if it leads to scrutiny of their operations. The VA\u2019s leadership worked with OSC to resolve this troubling case.\u201d\n\n(Image via Nirat.pix/Shutterstock.com)", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Charles S.
