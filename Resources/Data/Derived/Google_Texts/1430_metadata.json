Richard Beaven for The Wall Street Journal\n\nNew York state budget officials have restored nearly $7 million in annual funding for spinal cord injury research after an influential lobby of paraplegics put pressure on Albany lawmakers and Gov. Andrew Cuomo\u2018s administration.\n\nThe group, New Yorkers to Cure Paralysis, had tried unsuccessfully since 2010 to restore about $8.5 million in annual state funding for the research, which they argued is required to be spent by state law. Roughly $2 million was restored last year, and Mr. Cuomo\u2019s original 2014 budget earmarked a total of $4.9 million.\n\nThe paraplegics\u2019 group spent the last several weeks lobbying state lawmakers personally, and won a crucial ally in Assembly Majority Leader Joseph Morelle. In its final budget, which was signed into law last week, New York state officials ultimately gave the program $7.9 million, which includes $900,000 that went unspent last year. No reason for the increase was given. \u201cIt\u2019s just part of budget negotiations,\u201d said Morris Peters, a spokesman for the New York State Division of Budget.\n\nMedical researchers hailed the funding as a way to establish New York as a national leader in neurological research. The paraplegics\u2019 group included several rehabilitation facilities, medical centers and foundations across the state.\n\n\u201cThis funding also creates an opportunity to make important contributions to patient care and reduce health-care costs for multiple afflictions,\u201d including stroke and Parkinson\u2019s disease, said Mark Noble, professor of genetics, neurobiology and neurology at the University of Rochester Medical Center.\n\nThe lobbying group included retired New York state trooper Paul Richter, who was shot and paralyzed in 1973 during a traffic stop in Lake Placid, N.Y.; Wall Street financier David Carmel, who was paralyzed in a 1999 diving accident in Mexico; Nancy A. Lieberman, a Manhattan corporate attorney who was paralyzed in 2007 during a skiing accident in Colorado; and Paul Francis, a former New York state budget director who is not paralyzed but had his left arm amputated below the elbow after a bout of sepsis in 2012.\n\n\u201cWith this funding, state leaders are fulfilling a commitment to scientists and doctors who moved to New York, in part, because of this program,\u201d Mr. Carmel said. \u201cIt will also generate hundreds of high-paying jobs and encourage more life-science companies to move to our state.\u201d\n\nThe program was started in 1998 and paid for through a surcharge on state traffic fines but it was cut by former Gov. David Paterson\u2018s administration in 2010 amid a $9.2 billion budget shortfall.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "New York state budget officials have restored nearly $7 million in annual funding for spinal cord injury research after an influential lobby of paraplegics put pressure on Albany lawmakers and Gov.
