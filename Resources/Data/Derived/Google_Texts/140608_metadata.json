I\u2019ve seen some estimates of 56 separate votes, though some put the total a little higher.\n\nBut let\u2019s not forget their friends on the other side of the Capitol. As National Journal reports , Senate Republicans are at least going through the motions to keep their repeal crusade alive, too.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has proposed repealing Obamacare as part of the long-term highway bill currently being considered in the upper chamber. McConnell\u2019s office said Friday that the Senate would vote Sunday on an amendment to the highway legislation that would repeal the Affordable Care Act. The initial vote, which would cap debate on the repeal amendment, would need 60 votes.\n\nObviously, this is a ridiculous endeavor. The very idea of repealing an effective health care law is increasingly bizarre, and as Senate GOP leaders realize, there\u2019s zero chance of the repeal measure passing. The fact that Mitch McConnell sees this as a necessary part of the debate over highway spending is itself quite sad.\n\nSo why in the world is the Republican leader doing this, announcing an ACA repeal vote out of the blue? Apparently because McConnell is looking for an adequate pacifier for his far-right flank and this is the best he could come up with.\n\nThis gets a little complicated, but McConnell appears to see Obamacare repeal as a spoonful of sugar to help the medicine go down. The medicine, in this case, is the restoration of the Export-Import Bank. The Washington Post reported this morning on how the Senate Majority Leader hopes to get the highway bill through the chamber:\n\nMcConnell \u2026 set up votes on two controversial measures \u2013 a repeal of the Affordable Care Act, and a reauthorization of the Export-Import Bank of the United States \u2013 and did it in such a way that will make it difficult for other amendments to be considered. That move incensed [Sen. Ted Cruz] \u2013 who had announced his intention to offer other amendments, and who, like many conservatives, strongly opposes the bank\u2019s reauthorization, though it enjoys support from a supermajority of his Senate colleagues. While McConnell has personally spoken against Ex-Im reauthorization, Democrats said in June he had agreed to schedule an Ex-Im vote in order to get highly divisive trade legislation passed.\n\nThough McConnell said there was no deal, Cruz is now convinced that McConnell lied, which has apparently enraged the Texas Republican. Politico added\n\nTed Cruz took to the Senate floor Friday and charged that Mitch McConnell told a \u201clie,\u201d escalating his campaign against GOP leaders and challenging the traditions of the usually decorous chamber. In a scathing floor speech, the Texas firebrand accused the Senate majority leader of breaking his word to him and the rest of the GOP conference over McConnell\u2019s plans for the controversial Export-Import Bank, the country\u2019s chief export credit agency.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "description": "The very idea of repealing an effective health care law is bizarre.
