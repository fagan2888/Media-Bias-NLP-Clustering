(It\u2019s the second half of a split-squad day for the Rockies). It\u2019s fair to say the Friedrich is ahead of schedule and will make a bid for a spot in the rotation now that right-hander Jhoulys Chacin is out with a shoulder strain.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m throwing everything now,\u201d Friedrich said Wednesday morning. \u201cSome of the pitches I threw (Tuesday in live batting practice) felt really good. I was really able to let them go. I\u2019ve had no issues with the back. There are no brakes being put on me, so whatever I can handle, I can handle.\u201d\n\nBut is he far enough along to compete for a spot in the rotation? \u201cYes, but I\u2019ve been around this team long enough to know that we are going to need seven our eight guys through the course of our season.
