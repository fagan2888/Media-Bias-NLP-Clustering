The forum held at the University of Memphis Fogelman Executive Conference Center landed two days after Gov. Bill Haslam announced \u201cInsure Tennessee.\u201d\n\nIf approved by the Legislature early next year, the program would use Medicaid expansion dollars promised by the Affordable Care Act \u2014 but refused so far by Tennessee \u2014 to provide an alternative approach for health coverage for an estimated 200,000 Tennesseans with household incomes of up to 138 percent of the poverty level, or about $16,105 for an individual in 2014.\n\nMethodist Le Bonheur Health Care chief executive officer Gary Shorb outlined the health challenges facing Tennessee, ranked 42nd by America\u2019s Health Rankings with high rates of diabetes, cardiovascular disease and cancer.\n\nShorb said a statewide group of health care providers, business and civic associations called Coalition for a Healthy Tennessee has been formed to promote and advocate for the Insure Tennessee plan. It has about 90 members so far.\n\n\u201cAdvocating and supporting Insure Tennessee is the right thing to do and it certainly is going to be good for Tennessee and, after this forum, I hope you would agree it will be something you\u2019ll strongly advocate and promote,\u201d Shorb said.\n\nFirst Horizon National Corp. chief executive officer Bryan Jordan provided the keynote address for about 175 people gathered for the forum. Jordan outlined the wellness efforts, incentives and benefits at the company, parent to First Tennessee Bank, designed to encourage a healthy workplace.\n\nThe health care \u201ccrisis\u201d threatens public resources \u2014 accounting for 32 percent of the state budget \u2014 as well as economic opportunity for unhealthy citizens and a state competing for business, Jordan said. Promoting healthy behaviors and expanding access, two issues addressed by the Insure Tennessee plan, are needed, he said.\n\n\u201cEmployers cannot afford not to support health and wellness solutions,\u201d Jordan said. \u201cOur current health path is unsustainable. Dealing with this health crisis will require a public-private partnership, and this forum can be a great start.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"title": "Memphis forum highlights health crisis, rallies for Medicaid expansion", "og": {"url": "http://www.commercialappeal.com/business/memphis-forum-highlights-health-crisis-rallies-for-medicaid-expansion-ep-830680460-323464611.html", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.jrn.com/images/health_talks_11320257_ver1.0_640_480.jpg", "height": 427}, "type": "article", "description": "A business forum on Tennessee's health crisis rallied support for Medicaid expansion.", "title": "Memphis forum highlights health crisis, rallies for Medicaid expansion"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.jrn.com/images/health_talks_11320257_ver1.0_640_480.jpg", "title": "Memphis forum highlights health crisis, rallies for Medicaid expansion", "description": "A business forum on Tennessee's health crisis rallied support for Medicaid expansion.", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "https://twitter.com/memphisnews"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://media.jrn.com/designimages/logo-ca-icon-144.png", "__sync_contentCategory": "premium", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdec70\"", "article_summary": "Promoting healthy behaviors and expanding access, two issues addressed by the Insure Tennessee plan, are needed, he said.\nThe Tennessee Business Roundtable, a pro-business policy group based in Nashville, organized similar forums in major cities of the state.\nMethodist Le Bonheur Health Care chief executive officer Gary Shorb outlined the health challenges facing Tennessee, ranked 42nd by America\u2019s Health Rankings with high rates of diabetes, cardiovascular disease and cancer.\nDealing with this health crisis will require a public-private partnership, and this forum can be a great start.\u201d\nThe forum held at the University of Memphis Fogelman Executive Conference Center landed two days after Gov."}
