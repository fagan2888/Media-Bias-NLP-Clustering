No charges were immediately announced.\n\nNemtsov\u2019s killing shocked Russia\u2019s already beleaguered and marginalized opposition supporters. Suspicion in the opposition is high that the killing was ordered by the Kremlin in retaliation for Nemtsov\u2019s adamant criticism of President Vladimir Putin. The 55-year-old was working on a report about Russian military involvement in the eastern Ukraine conflict.\n\nBut Russia\u2019s top investigative body said it was investigating several possible motives, including that he was killed in an attempt to smear Putin\u2019s image. It also said it was looking into possible connections to Islamic extremism and Nemtsov\u2019s personal life.\n\nMany believe that Nemtsov\u2019s death in a tightly secured area near the Kremlin wouldn\u2019t have been possible without official involvement, and could be an attempt to scare other government foes.\n\nPutin dubbed Nemtsov\u2019s killing a \u201cprovocation.\u201d\n\nOne of Nemtsov\u2019s closest allies in the opposition, Ilya Yashin, said on Fcebook after the announcement that \u201cIt\u2019s hard to judge whether these are the real performers of if the investigation went down a false track.\u201d\n\nIn any case, he said, \u201cit\u2019s extremely important that the matter not be limited to detention of the shooters, whether these are the real killers or not. The key task is the identification and detention of who ordered\u201d the attack.\n\n\u201cFor the time being, it\u2019s very skimpy information, which tells us little, but it\u2019s good that the first results of the investigation has appeared,\u201d another opposition leader, former Prime Minister Mikhail Kasyanov, was quoted as telling the news agency Interfax.\n\nIn some previous killings of Kremlin critics, especially the murder of journalist Anna Politkovskaya in 2006, there has been wide criticism that those who ordered the killing have not been identified or prosecuted.\n\nThe North Caucasus region from which the suspects reportedly come includes Chechnya, where two separtatist rebels fought two wars against Russian forces over the past two decades and which now is in under the tight control of Kremlin-backed leader Ramzan Kadyrov.\n\nKadyrov has been widely criticized for brutality against opponents, including summary executions and abductions, and is a vehement defender of Putin. He blamed Western security services for Nemtsov\u2019s killing.\n\nThe suspects were identified as Anzor Gubashev and Zaur Dadaev. No further information was given about them, but opposition figures unearthed a statement from the Chechen government from 2010 in which a Zaur Dadaev was among the police troops awarded medals.\n\nKremlin critics say the spiteful nationalist propaganda on state television, which cast Nemtsov and other liberals as Western stooges, helped prepare the ground for his killing.\n\n\u201cThe atmosphere of mad aggression created by the state television \u2026 has signaled that you could do anything to the people expressing a different view, this will benefit the Motherland,\u201d Dmitry Muratov, the editor of the Novaya Gazeta, a newspaper critical of the Kremlin, told the AP on Friday.\n\nNemtsov was walking with a young Ukrainian woman, Anna Duritskaya, when he was shot. The woman has returned to Ukraine after questioning by police and the state news agency RIA Novosti on Saturday quoted her lawyer Vadim Prokhorov as saying she has not been called back to Russia for testimony in connection with the detentions.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Two suspects have been detained in the killing a week ago of opposition politician Boris Nemtsov, the head of Russia's federal security service said Saturday, an announcement received with both skepticism and reserved satisfaction by some of Nemtsov's comrades.", "Author": "Douglas  Ernst", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Two suspects have been detained in the killing a week ago of opposition politician Boris Nemtsov, the head of Russia\u2019s federal security service said Saturday, an announcement received with both skepticism and reserved satisfaction by some of Nemtsov\u2019s comrades.", "title": "Russia detains 2 suspects in killing of Boris Nemtsov", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/mar/7/russia-detains-2-suspects-killing-boris-nemtsov/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/03/04/Russia_Nemtsov.JPEG-0c01b.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/03/04/Russia_Nemtsov.JPEG-0c01b.jpg", "title": "Russia detains 2 suspects in killing of Boris Nemtsov", "description": "Two suspects have been detained in the killing a week ago of opposition politician Boris Nemtsov, the head of Russia's federal security service said Saturday, an announcement received with both skepti", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "news_keywords": "Politics, Russia, Vladimir Putin, Ukraine"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd014e\"", "article_summary": "He blamed Western security services for Nemtsov\u2019s killing.\nKremlin critics say the spiteful nationalist propaganda on state television, which cast Nemtsov and other liberals as Western stooges, helped prepare the ground for his killing.\nNemtsov\u2019s killing shocked Russia\u2019s already beleaguered and marginalized opposition supporters.\nAlexander Bortnikov, in comments shown on state television, said the two suspects were from Russia\u2019s North Caucasus region, but gave no details other than their names.\nSuspicion in the opposition is high that the killing was ordered by the Kremlin in retaliation for Nemtsov\u2019s adamant criticism of President Vladimir Putin."}
