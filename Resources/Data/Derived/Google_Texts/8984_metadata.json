Insurers must notify the exchange of their intent to apply by Feb. 16.\n\nMany consumers may welcome the fresh competition.\n\nCalifornia Insurance Commissioner Dave Jones has criticized the state exchange for a lack of insurers in some areas. Overall, four large insurance companies, led by Anthem Inc., controlled 94% of Covered California enrollment in its first year.\n\nUnitedHealth announced it was exiting California's individual health insurance market just prior to the launch of the Affordable Care Act in fall 2013. It canceled its remaining policies at the end of that year.\n\nUnitedHealth continued to serve California employers and workers. The company covers more than 3.1 million Californians.\n\nBut leaving the individual market usually means an insurer can't return to that business for five years.\n\nCuevas said \"we have been collaborating with regulators to determine the feasibility of 2016 market re-entry.\"\n\nUnitedHealth didn't comment on the criticism of its skinny health plans. It has defended them in the past as a product that some customers want.\n\nAnthony Wright, executive director of Health Access, said Covered California must close that loophole before allowing new insurers in.\n\n\"We want other health plans, but we want them to be good partners who make the Affordable Care Act work rather than punching holes through the intent of the law,\" Wright said. \"We want to nip this in the bud.\"\n\nThe Obama administration took steps late last year to limit the appeal of narrow employer plans. These policies typically cover doctor visits and preventive care but exclude major benefits such as hospitalization.\n\nCovered California offers a big opportunity for insurers. The exchange signed up 1.2 million people during the initial rollout and 217,000 have newly enrolled since Nov. 15.\n\nAfter taking a wait-and-see approach to Obamacare, UnitedHealth now participates in 23 state exchanges across the country.\n\nA spokeswoman for Covered California declined to comment ahead of Thursday's board discussion.\n\nThe exchange's longstanding policy has been to wait until 2017 to add health plans that had passed on the initial rollout.\n\nTwitter: @chadterhune", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Giant insurer UnitedHealth wants to join California's Obamacare market", "date": "2015-01-15", "googlebot": "index", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times", "author": "Los Angeles Times", "og": {"site_name": "latimes.com", "description": "Two years after spurning the state, insurance giant UnitedHealth Group Inc. wants to sell Obamacare coverage in California\u2019s exchange for 2016.", "title": "Giant insurer UnitedHealth wants to join California's Obamacare market", "url": "http://www.latimes.com/business/healthcare/la-fi-obamacare-unitedhealth-california-20150115-story.html", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-54b77524/turbine/la-fi-obamacare-unitedhealth-california-20150115", "type": "article"}, "x-servername": "lalvp12.13", "twitter": {"site": "@latimes", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "index,follow", "keywords": "obamacare, affordable care act, UnitedHealth, Covered California, Oscar", "fb": {"admins": 100000786395051, "page_id": 5863113009}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=373238146, app-argument=http://www.latimes.com/deeplinkid/82538040", "googlebot-news": "index", "msvalidate.01": "AAC9C18F70AC386BC4DCF4DDF9BF1786", "news_keywords": "obamacare, affordable care act, UnitedHealth, Covered California, Oscar", "y_key": "cee2fe4077f8d050", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "Description": "Two years after spurning the state, insurance giant UnitedHealth Group Inc. wants to sell Obamacare coverage in California\u2019s exchange for 2016.
