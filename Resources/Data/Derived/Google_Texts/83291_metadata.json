Credit: Rick Wood\n\nBy of the\n\nSaturday at a glance:\n\nPLAYER OF THE GAME\n\nBy the end of UW's four-point loss to Iowa, the play of Joe Schobert had fans asking whether the senior linebacker could spend some time on offense, too.\n\nWhy not?\n\nSchobert, who was an all-state safety and tailback at Waukesha West High School, was magnificent Saturday as UW fell to Iowa for the first time since 2009.\n\nLet the numbers tell the tale:\n\nEight tackles, including 3\u00bd for loss; five quarterback hurries, one of which resulted in an interception; three sacks; two forced fumbles; and one fumble recovery.\n\nSchobert drilled Iowa quarterback C.J. Beathard as he was releasing the ball, causing an errant throw and an interception by safety Michael Caputo. That gave UW the ball at its 45 in the third quarter and led to a field goal.\n\nSchobert forced a fumble by Beathard and recovered the ball at the Iowa 27 early in the fourth quarter. That led to zero points, however, because Joel Stave fumbled the ball at the Iowa 1.\n\nSchobert later forced a fumble by Iowa tailback Jordan Canzeri, but the Hawkeyes recovered at their 19.\n\nThrough five games, Schobert has nine sacks and 13 tackles for loss. He entered the day tied for the national lead in tackles for loss and tied for fourth nationally in sacks.\n\n\"I've been impressed with Joe ever since I started watching tape of him,\" UW coach Paul Chryst said, \"and then when you're around him...I'm not surprised because I think that he's earned the right where you expect it a little bit.\"\n\nOFFENSIVE PLAY OF THE GAME\n\nAt the time the 1-yard touchdown pass from Beathard to Iowa tight end George Kittle didn't seem all that significant.\n\nThe play helped Iowa take a 7-3 lead with 2:59 left in the first quarter, leaving UW with 32:59 to dig out of the four-point hole.\n\nUW couldn't muster enough offense to do that, however, making Beathard's play and Marshall Koehn's subsequent conversion huge.\n\nIowa took over at the UW 31 thanks to an interception and 15-yard return by cornerback Desmond King.\n\nThe Hawkeyes moved to the 1 on four plays, and on first and goal Beathard faked a handoff and rolled right.\n\nKittle, who entered the day with four catches for 69 yards and a touchdown, came across the field from left to right. When he came open on the right side, Beathard found him for an easy score.\n\nDEFENSIVE PLAY OF THE GAME\n\nUW's players and coaches will be sick \u2014 if they aren't already \u2014 when they review the lost fumble by Stave with the Badgers facing second and goal at the Iowa 1 in the fourth quarter with Iowa leading, 10-6.\n\nRight guard Micah Kapoi was pushed back just enough that his foot landed on top of one of Stave's feet. Stave, who according to Chryst took a false step forward after the snap, fell back toward the turf.\n\nInstead of holding onto the ball and settling for third and goal at about the 4, Stave tried to hand the ball to tailback Taiwan Deal.\n\nThe ball fell to the turf, Deal missed a chance to corral it and Iowa's Faith Ekakitie recovered at the 4.\n\nCrushing.\n\n\"I came close to it,\" Deal said. \"I felt it on my hip but I couldn't get it. There was too many Iowa defenders around.\"\n\nSPECIAL TEAMS PLAY OF THE GAME\n\nAfter an uneven start as a freshman, kicker Rafael Gaglianone made his final 14 field-goal attempts to finish 19 of 22.\n\nGaglianone won't be able to match that conversion rate of 86.4% no matter how well he kicks the rest of the 2015 season.\n\nThe sophomore made 2 of 3 attempts in the loss to Iowa, hitting from 46 yards twice and missing from 42. That left his season mark at 6 of 10 (60%).\n\nThe miss from 42 yards, with 11:43 remaining in the second quarter, turned out to be crucial.\n\nUW held a 3-0 lead at the time so the miss prevented the Badgers from padding the lead and hurt in the final quarter when Iowa was clinging to a 10-6 lead.\n\nThat meant UW had to go for a touchdown on its final possession rather than a potential game-winning field goal.\n\n\"I'm having a tough time with the wind,\" said Gaglianone, who missed from 52 in Week 3 against Troy and from 51 in Week 4 against Hawaii. \"It has been a different year. It has been a tough couple of games....\n\n\"But I've got to put that behind me and focus on next week.\"\n\nINSIDE THE HUDDLE\n\n\u25a0 UW defensive coordinator Dave Aranda, who had used a 2-4-5 scheme in each of the last three games because the Badgers faced spread offenses, stuck with that look for much of the game Saturday. The change came in how Aranda pared the down linemen. He opened with freshman Olive Sagapolu and Arthur Goldberg on early downs. He used Chikwe Obasih and Conor Sheehy together and went with Zander Neuville and linebacker T.J. Watt on passing downs. Watt, 6 feet 5 inches and 244 pounds, lined up over the center. Goldberg led the linemen in tackles with four. Sagapolu added two assisted tackles.\n\n\u25a0 Iowa was without two key players \u2014 wide receiver Tevaun Smith (knee) and left tackle Boone Myers (stinger). Smith was leading the Hawkeyes in yards per catch (19.6) and receiving yards per game (58.8). He also was tied for the team lead in touchdown catches (two).\n\nQUOTE OF THE GAME\n\n\"I thought the defense did a tremendous job continuing to battle, giving us opportunities. We just have to come away with something.\"\n\nBY THE NUMBERS\n\n4 Turnovers by QB Joel Stave (above)\n\n8 UW drives ending in Iowa territory\n\n10 Iowa points off UW turnovers\n\n14 Tackles by Iowa LB Cole Fisher\n\n33.3% UW's third-down conversion rate in the last three games (11 of 33)\n\n86 Rushing yards for UW\n\nUP NEXT\n\nUW (3-2, 0-1 Big Ten) at Nebraska (2-3, 0-1), 2:30p.m.Saturday\n\nThe loser of this game likely can bid farewell to its hopes of winning the Big Ten West title. Nebraska suffered a 14-13 loss Saturday at Illinois after the Illini scored twice in the fourth quarter. Wes Lunt threw two touchdown passes in the quarter, including a 1-yarder with 10 seconds left for Illinois.\n\nJeff Potrykus", "article_metadata": {"title": "Badgers report: UW vs. Iowa", "og": {"url": "http://www.jsonline.com/sports/badgers/badgers-report-uw-vs-iowa-b99588517z1-330555011.html", "image": {"width": 1800, "identifier": "http://media.jrn.com/images/b99588517z.1_20151003234256_000_g6rcqrsq.1-1.jpg", "height": 1126}, "type": "article", "description": "The player and plays of the game, inside the huddle, quote and by the numbers", "title": "Badgers report: UW vs. Iowa"}, "twitter": {"site": "@journalsentinel", "image": "http://media.jrn.com/images/b99588517z.1_20151003234256_000_g6rcqrsq.1-1.jpg", "description": "The player and plays of the game, inside the huddle, quote and by the numbers", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Badgers report: UW vs. Iowa"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "fb": {"admins": "journal.sentinel.1", "app_id": 227386193957280}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://media.jrn.com/designimages/logo-mjs-144-icon.png", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "He entered the day tied for the national lead in tackles for loss and tied for fourth nationally in sacks.\nThat gave UW the ball at its 45 in the third quarter and led to a field goal.\nUW held a 3-0 lead at the time so the miss prevented the Badgers from padding the lead and hurt in the final quarter when Iowa was clinging to a 10-6 lead.\nSchobert forced a fumble by Beathard and recovered the ball at the Iowa 27 early in the fourth quarter.\nThat led to zero points, however, because Joel Stave fumbled the ball at the Iowa 1."}
