Mr. Obama accordingly noted today that he had directed the Justice Department to investigate the shooting in Ferguson, but the agency\u2019s response was already underway before the statement. His comments thus seemed intended instead to alleviate concerns that he was not taking what had happened seriously enough.\n\nPhoto\n\nBut will the president\u2019s involvement actually have a positive effect? Many who have called on Mr. Obama to speak up may not realize that it could be counterproductive for him to be visibly involved in the debate. Research by a Brown University political scientist, Michael Tesler, shows that the mere mention of Mr. Obama, the first African-American president, polarizes the public along racial lines on issues ranging from health care to how people feel about his dog, Bo.\n\nThe Ferguson controversy may end up being as divisive as the Trayvon Martin case and the arrest of the Harvard professor Henry Louis Gates \u2013 two racially charged controversies that became more prominent and arguably more polarized after Mr. Obama addressed them.\n\nMr. Obama\u2019s statement reflected these competing tensions. His statement emphasized \u201chealing\u201d and the need to \u201cfind a way to come together going forward\u201d while carefully balancing calls for \u201cjustice\u201d with reminders of the need to maintain \u201cpublic safety\u201d in his characteristic \u201con the one hand; on the other hand\u201d style of rhetoric.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn the end, of course, Mr. Obama may feel obligated to continue to speak out about the case regardless of the political consequences. But it\u2019s important to note just how limited his bully pulpit is on this issue. Just as his efforts to push through his legislative agenda can stimulate partisan opposition, making him the face of the Ferguson debate could provoke a backlash that could undermine the emerging bipartisan conversation about race and criminal justice in this country.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20140814162321, "twitter": {"description": "The mere mention of Mr. Obama polarizes the public along racial lines on issues ranging from health care to how people feel about his dog.", "title": "How Race Undermines Obama\u2019s Bully Pulpit on Ferguson", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/15/upshot/ferguson-drama-another-example-of-obamas-shrinking-bully-pulpit.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003056287"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "creator": "BrendanNyhan", "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/08/15/business/15up-obama/15up-obama-thumbLarge.jpg", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/15/upshot/ferguson-drama-another-example-of-obamas-shrinking-bully-pulpit.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003056287", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/15/upshot/ferguson-drama-another-example-of-obamas-shrinking-bully-pulpit.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "thumbnail_width": 75, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "upshot", "hdl_p": "How Race Undermines Obama\u2019s Bully Pulpit on Ferguson", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/upshot/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "Aug. 14, 2014", "edt": "The New York Times on the Web", "keywords": "Obama  Barack,Ferguson (Mo),Race and Ethnicity,United States Politics and Government", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "Brendan Nyhan", "thumbnail_150": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/08/15/business/15up-obama/15up-obama-thumbLarge.jpg", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "per": "Obama, Barack", "thumbnail_150_width": 150, "byl": "By BRENDAN NYHAN", "thumbnail_150_height": 150, "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "The mere mention of Mr. Obama polarizes the public along racial lines on issues ranging from health care to how people feel about his dog.", "tom": "News", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/08/15/business/15up-obama/15up-obama-thumbStandard.jpg", "description": "The mere mention of Mr. Obama polarizes the public along racial lines on issues ranging from health care to how people feel about his dog.", "CG": "upshot", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "Aug. 14, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "News", "article": {"section_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/upshot", "section": "The Upshot", "modified": "2014-08-14", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/upshot/index.jsonp", "tag": "United States Politics and Government", "published": "2014-08-14", "section-taxonomy-id": "D64FAE4C-4425-4E5A-B898-6C8CB59F9957"}, "thumbnail_height": 75, "geo": "Ferguson (Mo)", "slug": "15up-obama", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20140814173608, "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/15/upshot/ferguson-drama-another-example-of-obamas-shrinking-bully-pulpit.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/08/15/business/15up-obama/15up-obama-videoSixteenByNine1050.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "The mere mention of Mr. Obama polarizes the public along racial lines on issues ranging from health care to how people feel about his dog.", "title": "How Race Undermines Obama\u2019s Bully Pulpit on Ferguson"}, "pdate": 20140814, "des": "United States Politics and Government", "articleid": 100000003056287, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "How Race Undermines Obama\u2019s Bully Pulpit on Ferguson", "col": "A Polarized Public", "PST": "News"}, "article_summary": "But he soon came under pressure to address events there more forcefully, prompting him to interrupt his vacation in order to make a public statement today.\nMany who have called on Mr. Obama to speak up may not realize that it could be counterproductive for him to be visibly involved in the debate.\nMr. Obama accordingly noted today that he had directed the Justice Department to investigate the shooting in Ferguson, but the agency\u2019s response was already underway before the statement.\nBut it\u2019s important to note just how limited his bully pulpit is on this issue.\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main storyIn the end, of course, Mr. Obama may feel obligated to continue to speak out about the case regardless of the political consequences."}
