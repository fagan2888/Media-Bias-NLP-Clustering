NASCAR Friends

At the Daytona 500 race, Mitt Romney's attempt to connect with voters went awry when he admitted that he didn't follow racing as closely as "some of the most ardent fans." "But I have some friends who are NASCAR team owners," he added. At the same event, he told a group of fans wearing plastic ponchos, "I like those fancy raincoats you bought. Really sprung for the big bucks." Romney later defended the comment , saying, "Look, I have worn a garbage bag for rain gear myself."
