(Photo: Patrick Oehler/Poughkeepsie Journal)Buy Photo\n\nArea CPAs answered some taxing questions as they helped callers navigate their annual income tax forms Wednesday night.\n\nQuestions on the annual Dial-A-CPA night ranged from deducting medical expenses and retirement contributions to whether taxpayers qualify for exemptions under the guidelines of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThis annual service to readers of the Poughkeepsie Journal is provided through the Mid-Hudson Chapter of the New York State Society of Certified Public Accountants. Six area accountants were on hand to answer more than 40 of your calls.\n\nTax returns for the state and federal levels are due to be filed on or before April 18. James Passikoff, a managing partner of Passikoff & Scott, located in Poughkeepsie, said the biggest piece of advice he can give to taxpayers is to start planning to file one year in advance.\n\n\u201cIf you are going to file your 2015 taxes, make sure to start planning in January 2015,\u201d Passikoff said. \u201cKeep a record of what you have. If you get a letter from a charity you donated to, keep that letter. Don\u2019t wait until you file.\u201d\n\nPassikoff said that another popular question was about taxable IRA and 401Ks withdrawals for medical expenses.\n\n\u201cIf you take money out of a retirement savings account for medical expenses, the first $10,000 is not penalized,\u201d Passikoff said. \u201cAlthough, you still have to pay income tax on that money.\u201d\n\nBuy Photo Tracey Niemotko, Professor of Accounting and School of Business Chairperson, Mount Saint Mary College, answers a call to the Poughkeepsie Journal's Tax Counsel Clinic on Wednesday in the City of Poughkeepsie.

This year those forms will be released for the first time, so it is a bit easier to see if you comply. I would say only about three or four of the people I've talked with don't qualify for one or more of the exemptions.\u201d\n\nShinder said forms like the 1095-A, 1095-B and 1095-C help determine if you need to comply with the new shared responsibility payment, the fee you might have to pay if you don't have health insurance.\n\nEditors\u2019 note: The experts assisting the Poughkeepsie Journal\u2019s Dial-A-CPA Night offer general advice and are not a substitute for individualized counsel from a professional hired by you who has full knowledge of your finances and tax and income patterns.
