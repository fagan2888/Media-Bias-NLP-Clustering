As an associate at Lindquist & Vennum, Natzel has more than met the challenge of establishing himself in a new profession.\n\nNatzel works with employers, third-party administrators, trustees, and employee benefit vendors to make and administrate plans for retirement, health benefits and the like. He also helps clients stay in compliance with HIPAA, the Affordable Care Act, ERISA and other related laws. It\u2019s not an area of law he long had designs on, but he enjoys it.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there are too many people who go to law school thinking they want to be an employee benefits attorney,\u201d said Natzel. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely a specialty practice. But I was introduced to it here at Lindquist, primarily thanks to the other attorneys working in our group. They\u2019re fantastic attorneys and good mentors.\u201d\n\nNatzel also works on Lindquist\u2019s M&A transaction team. Last year, in the role of employee benefits specialist, he worked on more than 50 M&A transactions ranging in size from $1 million to over $500 million.\n\nBut he is seen as a firm leader when it comes to health care reform issues. He created internal policies to help a manufacturing company determine eligibility for health coverage for its seasonal employees in accordance with the ACA. He also developed and helped implement strategies for a restaurant chain that had numerous variable hour employees to reduce its potential liability under the ACA.\n\nNatzel enjoys the practice area right now because it\u2019s constantly changing\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s always something new to learn,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have to give clients advice based on not only what has happened so far, but also where you think the law is going.\n\n\u201cI think my practice will continue to evolve as health care reform and the benefits landscape continues to change.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Lindquist & Vennum", "generator": "WordPress", "author": "Dan Heilman", "og": {"site_name": "Minnesota Lawyer", "description": "Lindquist & Vennum", "title": "Up & Coming: Joshua T.
