Kelly Webb, GM and VP for MediGain's ASC Billing Division.

The 20th Annual Becker's Ambulatory Surgery Center (ASC) Conference starts on Thursday and MediGain's GM and VP of the ASC Billing Division, Kelly Webb, will be giving a presentation. Along with being the current GM and VP of MediGain's ASC Billing Division, Kelly Webb is also the founder and former CEO of ASC Billing Specialists. Mr. Webb consults with doctors on how to maximize profits and has helped numerous ASCs improve revenues by as much as 40 percent. He also has 10 years of experience interacting with insurance companies and is the lead negotiator with medical insurance companies to receive 80 percent payment on surgery billed charges for out of network claims.

If you have had concerns about how your ASC will fare with the new health care changes, this presentation will be very beneficial. Do you know if your practice is ready for a mass influx of PPO patients? Are you aware the $5,000 deductible can kill your business if you don't have a strategy? These are questions that Kelly will answer during his presentation.
