The weather on Monday night fell to the low 40s.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nAt approximately 9:30 p.m., Border Patrol agents were called to rescue a man who had been attempting to scale the fence along the Texas/Mexico border between Progresso in Texas and Nuevo Progresso in Mexico. The man was a double amputee whose legs were both amputated below the knee, according to KRGV News. The man had been left hanging on the south side of the fence.\n\nThe fire department from nearby Weslaco, Texas, was called to the scene to assist with the rescue. The rescuers found the man to be suffering from hypothermia from being exposed to the cold night\u2019s air for approximately two-and-one-half hours. He had been abandoned by his smugglers after he became entangled in the fence.\n\nThe illegal immigrant was taken to a local hospital for treatment. He was then taken to the Weslaco Border Patrol Station where he will be processed for deportation.\n\nBreitbart Texas has previously reported about illegal immigrants who are left to die when they cannot keep up with their smugglers. In 2014, the bodies of nearly sixty illegal immigrants were found in Brooks County, nearly 100 miles from the border. In the first seven weeks of 2015, seventeen bodies were discovered.\n\nBob Price is a senior political news contributor for Breitbart Texas and a member of the original Breitbart Texas team.
