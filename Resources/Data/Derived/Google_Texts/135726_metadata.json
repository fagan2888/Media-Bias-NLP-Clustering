( Courtesy photo )\n\nThe Miracle Letter Program (MLP), a non-profit that helps local families in need, recently benefited from the \"DaVita\u00ae Way of Giving.\"\n\nDaVita HealthCare Partners, the leading independent medical group in America and leading provider of kidney care services, recently made a $1,000 contribution to Miracle Letter Program (MLP).\n\nIn December, DaVita Northeastern Colorado Dialysis presented MLP with a $1,000 check as part of the company's locally focused charitable giving initiative that helps nonprofit organizations throughout the United States grow and thrive.\n\nThe MLP is a project of the Santas of Sterling that provides assistance to northeast Colorado families facing a catastrophic event such as a serious illness, injury or disaster. Children or family members are encouraged to write a letter to Santa outlining the need and leave their application in the traveling candy cane mailboxes that are hosted by community businesses that partner with the MLP. The organization seeks to assist those who do not qualify for other assistance to help them through the difficult time.\n\nDaVita HealthCare Partners teammates chose to donate to MLP because they have seen firsthand how this organization contributes to the community in unique ways.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"We chose this nonprofit because they help those that are facing tough situations and may not yet qualify for other assistance. They put smiles on the faces of people of all ages,\" said Debbie Etl, a DaVita HealthCare Partners administrative assistant and \"facility elf.\"\n\nDaVita HealthCare Partners is dedicated to spreading ripples of citizen leadership through its Trilogy of Care - Caring for Our Patients, Caring for Each Other and Caring for Our World.\n\nTo learn more about DaVita HealthCare Partners' community engagement efforts, please visit DaVita.com/CSR.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.journal-advocate.com/sterling-local_news/ci_29362101/dialysis-center-donates-miracles", "sailthru.author": "Staff report", "ag": {"canon": "JournalAdvocate:article:29362101:view"}, "startDate": "2016-01-09T07:04:32-0700", "twitter": {"domain": "journal-advocate.com", "description": "The Miracle Letter Program (MLP), a non-profit that helps local families in need, recently benefited from the \"DaVita\u00ae Way of Giving.", "title": "Dialysis center donates for miracles", "url": "http://www.journal-advocate.com/sterling-local_news/ci_29362101/dialysis-center-donates-miracles", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site19/2016/0108/20160108__09ST_davita~1.jpg", "site": "@SterlingJA", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "sailthru.section": "Local News", "modificationDate": "2016-01-08T20:46:57-0700", "endDate": "2026-01-08T20:44:23-0700", "news_keywords": "Local News, Local News news, Sterling Colorado Local News news, Sterling Colorado news, Local News Sterling news, Local News Colorado news, US Local News news, world Local News news.", "byline": "Staff report", "pubDate": "2016-01-08T20:48:33-0700", "sailthru.date": "2016-01-09T07:04:32-0700", "sailthru.title": "Dialysis center donates for miracles", "verify-v1": "BXs3Tp/yfKM8u4D/sQH/llaXrumTjsEN3+pi+oLzohs=", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site19/2016/0108/20160108__09ST_davita~1_300.jpg", "description": "The Miracle Letter Program (MLP), a non-profit that helps local families in need, recently benefited from the \"DaVita\u00ae Way of Giving.", "sailthru.site": "journal-advocate.com", "msvalidate.01": "9DAB14005AD5A9FFA4CA0EF58CC794BA", "og": {"url": "http://www.journal-advocate.com/sterling-local_news/ci_29362101/dialysis-center-donates-miracles", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site19/2016/0108/20160108__09ST_davita~1.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "The Miracle Letter Program (MLP), a non-profit that helps local families in need, recently benefited from the \"DaVita\u00ae Way of Giving.", "title": "Dialysis center donates for miracles"}, "google-site-verification": "2iNkVYi6fQKhylL0pQaJF4qvYsz3qMnvr9EdKrmIbvw", "y_key": "b781c784225bf6e2", "sailthru.image.full": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site19/2016/0108/20160108__09ST_davita~1.jpg"}, "article_summary": "To learn more about DaVita HealthCare Partners' community engagement efforts, please visit DaVita.com/CSR.\nThey put smiles on the faces of people of all ages,\" said Debbie Etl, a DaVita HealthCare Partners administrative assistant and \"facility elf.\"\n( Courtesy photo )The Miracle Letter Program (MLP), a non-profit that helps local families in need, recently benefited from the \"DaVita\u00ae Way of Giving.\"\nDaVita HealthCare Partners is dedicated to spreading ripples of citizen leadership through its Trilogy of Care - Caring for Our Patients, Caring for Each Other and Caring for Our World.\nDaVita HealthCare Partners teammates chose to donate to MLP because they have seen firsthand how this organization contributes to the community in unique ways."}
