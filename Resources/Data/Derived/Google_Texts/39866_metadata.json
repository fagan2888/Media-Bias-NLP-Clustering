The measure will go on the ballot if two other committees and the full board give it the green light.\n\nThe site of the new shelter is undetermined. In any case the current facility, which dates to 1971, would be torn down. It is located off Cedar Street in Mason, near the Ingham County Jail.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s 45 years old and it is in need of some serious maintenance,\u201d Animal Control Director John Dinon said Friday. \u201cBut more importantly it was designed at a time when animal control functions were very different that they are today.\u201d\n\nHe said the current Ingham County shelter is inadequate for the adoption program in use now. There is only one entrance and there is little space for people to meet and bond with animals, Dinon said.\n\nA worker at the Ingham County Animal Control Shelter in Mason, works in one of the holding areas Friday.

Of the 529 animals that came in during the first three months of this year, 233 were adopted.\n\nAlong with the new 21,000-square-foot shelter \u2014 the current one is about 11,800 square feet \u2014 Dinon said the new tax also would provide:\n\nSix days of service instead of five. The shelter would be open Sundays in addition to Tuesdays-Saturdays.\n\nEleven more staff members, bringing the total to 30. This would include two new animal control officers, raising that total to eight. There would be patrols seven days a week instead of six.\n\nTwo public entrances instead of one \u2014 an entrance for picking up animals and another for dropping them off.\n\nRestoration of after-hours on-call service of the animal control officers for law enforcement. The 24/7 service was cut out of the department\u2019s budget in 2006.\n\nSpeaking to the committee on Thursday, Dinon said if the public was paying for a new shelter, they should expect improved services. He called the current level of service \u201cinadequate.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen you come to the shelter there 20 people in the lobby and two clerks serving them,\u201d he said.\n\nDinon was hired in October to replace Andy Seltz, who had resigned to run Livingston County\u2019s animal control department. Most recently Dinon, a Michigan State University graduate, served as outreach and engagement director for the U.S. Humane Society in Toledo, Ohio,\n\nFreeing up general fund money\n\nThe controller\u2019s office provided the committee three suggested proposals: A 0.14-mill increase for a new shelter only' a 0.31 mill proposal addressing a new shelter and raise money for staff, which current comes in large part from the county's general fund; and a 0.46-mill request covering the second option and increased services. The third option would replace the general fund money with millage money.\n\nThe department's annual budget is about $1.7 million, with $1 million coming from the county\u2019s general fund. Another $700,000 is generated by fees.\n\nWhat commissioners agreed on is a 0.35-mill proposal that builds a new facility, reduces the reliance on county general funds and increases some services. County officials say the millage would generate about $2.4 million in its first year and cost the owner of a home with a taxable value of $75,000 about $26 more in taxes annually.\n\nChief Deputy Controller John Neilsen said Friday the millage proposal would offset most of the county's contribution from the general fund \u2014 $600,000 to $700,000 \u2014 although the exact number still was being calculated.\n\nBuy Photo The Ingham County Animal Control Shelter is shown Friday.

The board has taken heat because no strategy was in place when it pursued a parks and trails millage in 2014 that voters approved. It just recently was able to put a grant process in place that allows communities to begin spending money, and it spent $70,000 for a consulting firm to come up with a plan to allocate the money.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going to get criticized for not having a plan,\u201d Tsernoglou said. \u201cWe know exactly what the money is going to be used for if we choose to do it.\u201d\n\nTwo Republican commissioners, Randy Maiville of Onondaga and Randy Schafer of Williamston, both cited the high amount of taxes that county residents pay already. Schafer casting the lone vote against the proposal.\n\nSchafer called the county\u2019s total levy of some 9.8 mills \u201castronomically high\u201d and said the county already has several special millages\n\nMaiville said the board could look into cutting other millage levies, particularly the health services millage, which was cut in October from 0.52 mills to 0.35 mills after many of the county\u2019s low income residents began qualifying for coverage under the Affordable Care Act and expanded Medicaid.\n\nThat reduction in the millage saved taxpayers about $1.1 million a year.\n\nContact Curt Smith at (517) 377-1226 or csmith@lsj.com.
