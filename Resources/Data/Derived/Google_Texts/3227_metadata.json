On Wednesday, Norfolk County Superior Court Judge Douglas Wilkins ruled that Fontbonne Academy, a Catholic all-girls school in Milton, cannot refuse to hire a man who is married to another man, despite the fact that Catholic teaching defines marriage as between a man and a woman. Ironically, this is exactly the scenario that the religious exemption amendment to the 1989 bill adding sexual orientation to our state employment non-discrimination laws was designed to prevent.\n\nAs Judge Wilkins pointed out, however, this was a case of \u201cfirst impression,\u201d meaning that the law had yet to be tested in court on this issue. Pinning his reasoning on the state\u2019s definition of employer, rather than the religious safe harbor provision that should apply, Judge Wilkins confined religious protection to schools that \u201climit membership, enrollment, admission or participation\u201d to members of the specific faith of the school.\n\nBut this is a dubious interpretation of the law at best and results in essentially eliminating protections for the vast majority of religious schools. Most faith-based schools, Catholic or otherwise, open their doors to students of other faiths or no faith at all. Fontbonne is no exception. Ironically, it is precisely this openness to diversity which the court said negates the school\u2019s right to define school culture and control its faith-based mission.\n\nThis is, frankly, preposterous. Apparently, religious schools in Massachusetts that wish to operate according to the tenets of their faith must now enforce an insular and exclusive membership of believers or else face crippling law suits for daring to maintain a religious identity. But Catholic schools, like most religious schools, have never been about exclusivity. Indeed, the very purpose of religious education is to inculcate the values and traditions of the faith in believers and non-believers alike.\n\nAccording to Judge Wilkins, another reason that Fontbonne did not qualify for the exemption is that it \u201cencourages debate, including on issues of same-sex marriage, and does not prohibit students from exploring and even advocating ideas and positions contrary to church teachings.\u201d Thus, according to Wilkins, religious schools that wish to qualify for the statute\u2019s explicit religious exemption must not only close themselves to non-believers, they must also actively squelch academic inquiry and prohibit diversity of thought.\n\nIt is hard to believe that the authors of the Massachusetts statute envisioned this result. Could our state legislature have possibly intended to require religious schools to wall themselves off from the world and suspend all intellectual debate in order to qualify as \u201creligious\u201d for purposes of the exemption? Unlikely. And, yet, that is exactly what Judge Wilkins\u2019 decision demands.\n\nUnfortunately, the court\u2019s ruling in the Fontbonne case was not the only blow to religious liberty in Massachusetts this week. Yesterday, the Board of Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center permanently terminated the medical privileges of Dr. Paul Church, a Harvard Medical School professor and urologist, who (consistent with his faith) spoke out against sex between men as medically unsafe and called on the hospital to stop promoting the gay lifestyle.\n\nFor more than half his life, Dr. Church has treated patients and conducted research on prostate and bladder cancer. But the hospital maintains that Church, who faithfully served the hospital for over thirty-five years, is guilty of \u201charassment\u201d and making statements that were \u201cdiscriminatory\u201d and \u201coffensive.\u201d In this case, the offensive language Church is accused of using is simply medical fact, easily viewable on the website of the Center for Disease Control, and the expression of his personal faith.\n\nBIDMC\u2019s efforts to silence Church demonstrate a lack of respect for his moral and religious convictions and his right to have those convictions inform his practice.\n\nYet, those same convictions have also driven Church to participate in medical missions throughout his career. He often volunteers his time giving essential healthcare to the poor in Mexico. Most recently, he travelled to Liberia, the African country at the center of last year\u2019s deadly Ebola virus outbreak. Tragically, the hospital has allowed its stated mission of providing \u201cextraordinary care, where the patient comes first\u201d to be impeded by the dictates of sexual identity politics.\n\nThe difference between the Fontbonne case and the Church case is that BIDMC is not a religious organization and, therefore, may not discriminate on the basis of religion or religious expression. What these two instances have in common, however, is that they both serve as harbingers of what is to come for people of faith in Massachusetts when their sincerely held beliefs conflict with the sentiments of the majority.\n\nMassachusetts Family Institute, the local Massachusetts affiliate of Focus on the Family, has been warning about this loss of religious freedom since before the Goodridge decision. Despite regularly being told that our arguments about this slippery slope were hysterical tactics in fear-mongering, the events of this week show our concerns to have been legitimate. We take no joy in being proven right. We are now witnessing the fulfillment of what commentator Rod Dreher has called the \u201cLaw of Merited Impossibility: It won\u2019t happen, and when it does, you bigots will deserve it.\u201d\n\nAndrew Beckwith is President of the Massachusetts Family Institute.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.", "article_metadata": {"shareaholic": {"site_name": "NewBostonPost", "language": "en-US", "url": "http://newbostonpost.com/2015/12/18/will-religious-liberty-survive-in-massachusetts/", "article_author_name": "Andrew Beckwith", "image": "http://newbostonpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/FontbonneAcademy.jpg", "site_id": "ab905d8abdbd23a369259b08e0927728", "shareable_page": "true", "keywords": "151B, Dr. Paul Church, Fontbonne, Paul Church, religious exemption, religious liberty"}, "description": "On Wednesday, Norfolk County Superior Court Judge Douglas Wilkins ruled that Fontbonne Academy, a Catholic all-girls school in Milton, cannot refuse to hire a", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"image": "http://newbostonpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/FontbonneAcademy.jpg"}, "keywords": "belief,church,religion,religion rights,freedom,justice,school,education,151b,dr. paul church,fontbonne,paul church,religious exemption,religious liberty", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Unfortunately, the court\u2019s ruling in the Fontbonne case was not the only blow to religious liberty in Massachusetts this week.\nBut Catholic schools, like most religious schools, have never been about exclusivity.\nBut this is a dubious interpretation of the law at best and results in essentially eliminating protections for the vast majority of religious schools.\nThe difference between the Fontbonne case and the Church case is that BIDMC is not a religious organization and, therefore, may not discriminate on the basis of religion or religious expression.\nCould our state legislature have possibly intended to require religious schools to wall themselves off from the world and suspend all intellectual debate in order to qualify as \u201creligious\u201d for purposes of the exemption?"}
