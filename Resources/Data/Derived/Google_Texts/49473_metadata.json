We get together. We play softball, basketball, we throw the football. We just fellowship, you know team building, and that's what it means to me,\" said Zaus Kirkland of Philadelphia.\n\nKirkland says Labor Day is known in history as people being off work and taking a break, but to him it is so much more than taking it easy.\n\n\"People getting together enjoying fellowship, good times, good laughter,\" said Kirkland.\n\nOregon was the first state to make it a holiday in 1887.
