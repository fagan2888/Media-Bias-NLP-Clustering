No more flu shots, no colonoscopies or other screenings, no pacemakers or surgery. \u201cIf I develop cancer, I will refuse treatment,\u201d he writes. He won\u2019t even take antibiotics to cure pneumonia or an infection, preferring instead to be carried off by the \u201cquick and relatively painless\u201d death untreated infection usually leads to.\n\nOr so he says.\n\nDebate over the health resources consumed by America\u2019s elderly have been ongoing for decades. As a candidate for Massachusetts governor in 1990, Boston University\u2019s John Silber famously generated sparks when he replied to a question about the surging costs of medical care for the elderly by asserting: \u201cWhen you\u2019ve had a long life and you\u2019re ripe, then it\u2019s time to go.\u201d President Obama has suggested the same thing, albeit far more tactfully. In 2009 he cited his grandmother\u2019s hip-replacement surgery during her final illness, publicly questioning whether such costly procedures for the terminally ill are a \u201csustainable model\u201d for health care.\n\nOver the years Emanuel has energetically weighed in on cost concerns, but that\u2019s not the focus of his Atlantic essay. His argument is not about dollars and cents, it\u2019s about quality of life. Death is a loss, but \u201cliving too long is also a loss\u201d \u2014 loss of vigor, of autonomy, of productivity, of smarts, of ambition. If we\u2019re to take him at his word, he cannot bear the thought of slowing down as he ages. He recoils from the way the old gradually learn to \u201caccommodate [their] physical and mental limitations\u201d \u2014 retiring from a profession, taking up hobbies, doing and daring less.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAs walking becomes harder and the pain of arthritis limits the fingers\u2019 mobility, life comes to center around sitting in the den reading or listening to books on tape and doing crossword puzzles.\u201d Emanuel, whose essay is accompanied by a picture of himself and two nephews on Mount Kilimanjaro, would rather die of pneumonia than live like that. He maintains he is \u201ccertainly not scorning or dismissing people who want to live on\u201d despite the debilities of old age. But it\u2019s hard to take that disclaimer seriously, when the whole point of his essay is that a diminished life isn\u2019t worth prolonging.\n\nHe mocks Americans who exercise, do mental puzzles, and consume \u201cvarious juice and protein concoctions\u201d in their quest to live longer. \u201cManic desperation,\u201d he calls it. \u201cMisguided.\u201d \u201cPotentially destructive.\u201d That\u2019s not scorn?\n\nMaybe Emanuel is merely being provocative. He acknowledges that 75 is an arbitrary age to designate as the boundary between a vibrant life and a feeble one. He admits there are \u201cmyriad people I know who are over 75 and doing quite well.\u201d At the start of his essay, he claims \u201cI am sure of my position\u201d \u2014 yet reserves the right, at the very end, to change his mind once he reaches his 75th birthday.\n\nEmanuel is 57 now, which gives him 18 years to reconsider his death wish, and to learn, perhaps, that the declines of advanced age can be a blessing as well as a curse. To be able to accept the pains and impediments of mortality requires a measure of courage and dignity that few of us are blessed with \u2014 or can even imagine \u2014 in our prime. Emanuel\u2019s own father, now 87, has slowed down considerably. His career is over. His son describes him as \u201csluggish,\u201d and seems confounded that the old man describes himself as happy.\n\nEmanuel may dread the prospect of ending up like his father.
