This time a town hall hosted by CNN and TV One at The Ohio State University as hosts Jake Tapper and Roland Martin reminded viewers repeatedly.\n\nWhile by now both candidates\u2019 basic stump speeches can be recited by even the most casual fan of Saturday Night Live, Sunday\u2019s event was saved by pointed questions concerning African-Americans in this country from Martin (like on the issue of minorities being locked out of unions and political consulting) and from the town hall audience.\n\nThe candidates received questions from a man who said he was both a one percent religious and ethnic minority in this country, a millennial small business owner and a Democrat who says she\u2019s been badly hurt by Obamacare.\n\nHere are the 4 best voter questioners from CNN\u2019s #Demtownhall:\n\nVictim of police shooting:\n\nThe first voter question of the night came from Terina Allen, whose brother Sam DuBose was shot in the head by a University of Cincinnati police officer during a routine traffic stop for a missing license plate last summer.\n\n\u201cAs Americans, we are \u2013 it\u2019s expected that we can speak out against terrorists, we can speak out against murders and killers of all forms except when that killer is a police officer,\u201d Allen said, noting her brother would have turned 44 on Saturday. \u201cAs president, what would you do to create a zero tolerance policy for unjust police killings, and to help to create a system of accountability that is greater than what we have right now,\u201d Allen asked Sanders.\n\nThe Vermont senator pledged to Allen that in a Sanders administration every death in police custody will result in \u201can automatic Department of Justice investigation.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy Department of Justice will investigate every killing of an American held in police custody or killed while being apprehended,\u201d Sanders vowed, repeating an audacious pledge he\u2019s made in the past.\n\nAs it stands now, no federal agency even tracks all officer-involved shootings or deaths in police custody. In fact, the Justice Department usually only intervenes in such cases if local officials ask them for assistance or if it is clear local departments are incapable of handling the investigation themselves.\n\nA former heroin addict:\n\nCrystal Oertle, a heroin addict for over 12 years, bravely stood up shared that as a mother who used to take her child with her to buy heroin daily she understands that she was \u201clucky not to be in prison,\u201d and asked Sanders, whom she she said she plans to vote for, about the failed war on drugs.\n\n\u201cMy question is what you plan to do with the failed drug policy that tends to want to incarcerate addicts instead of rehabilitate them,\u201d Oertle asked Sanders:\n\nSanders: We must look at addiction as a \u201chealth issue not a criminal issue\u201d #DemTownHall https://t.co/avxdNOphmH https://t.co/e9PHQK0hIA \u2014 CNN Politics (@CNNPolitics) March 14, 2016", "article_metadata": {"description": "By now, we've all heard the same old answers -- thankfully, the voters of Ohio asked different questions last night VIDEO", "author": "Sophia Tesfaye", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "By now, we've all heard the same old answers -- thankfully, the voters of Ohio asked different questions last night VIDEO", "title": "An exonerated death row inmate, heroin addict and Obamacare victim: The voters won CNN\u2019s Democratic town hall with these top 4 questions", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2016/03/14/an_exonerated_death_row_inmate_heroin_addict_and_obamacare_victim_the_voters_won_cnns_democratic_town_hall_with_these_top_4_questions/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/01/CNN-dem-debate.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "By now, we've all heard the same old answers -- thankfully, the voters of Ohio asked different questions last night VIDEO", "creator": "@@SophiaTesfaye", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/01/CNN-dem-debate.jpg", "title": "An exonerated death row inmate, heroin addict and Obamacare victim: The voters won CNN\u2019s Democratic town hall with these top 4 questions", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "An exonerated death row inmate, heroin addict and Obamacare victim: The voters won CNN\u2019s Democratic town hall with these top 4 questions", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, #demtownhall, 2016 Democratic primary, Bernie Sanders, CNN town hall, Election 2016, Elections 2016, Hillary Clinton, Video", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "This time a town hall hosted by CNN and TV One at The Ohio State University as hosts Jake Tapper and Roland Martin reminded viewers repeatedly.\nTopics: #demtownhall, 2016 Democratic primary, Bernie Sanders, CNN town hall, Election 2016, Elections 2016, Hillary Clinton, Video, Elections News, News, Politics NewsThere was yet another televised Democratic presidential showdown Sunday night.\nIn fact, the Justice Department usually only intervenes in such cases if local officials ask them for assistance or if it is clear local departments are incapable of handling the investigation themselves.\nAs it stands now, no federal agency even tracks all officer-involved shootings or deaths in police custody.\n\u201cAs president, what would you do to create a zero tolerance policy for unjust police killings, and to help to create a system of accountability that is greater than what we have right now,\u201d Allen asked Sanders."}
