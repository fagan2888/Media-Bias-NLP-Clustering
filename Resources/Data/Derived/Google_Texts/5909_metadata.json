Bob Beauprez to win this month\u2019s Colorado GOP gubernatorial primary, so they\u2019re hitting the airwaves with television ads aimed at boosting his nearest rival, former Rep. Tom Tancredo.\n\nProtect Colorado Values, a Democrat-backed 527 committee, released a reverse-psychology ad Thursday in the Denver media market that declares Mr. Tancredo is \u201ctoo conservative for Colorado\u201d because he\u2019s \u201cstill one of the country\u2019s strongest opponents of Obamacare.\u201d\n\nThe Affordable Care Act, of course, is hugely unpopular in Colorado, especially among Republicans. The primary election is June 24.\n\nPHOTOS: Eye-popping excuses in American political scandals\n\nColorado Republican Party chair Ryan Call condemned the ads, accusing \u201cliberal special interest groups\u201d of trying to manipulate the primary outcome and reminding voters that all four gubernatorial candidates oppose Obamacare.\n\nThat includes Mr. Beauprez, who has called on Democratic Gov. John Hickenlooper to \u201cstop this desperate attempt to manipulate Republican voters.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe reason they\u2019re running these ads is obvious: they want to avoid a legitimate challenge to John Hickenlooper in November,\u201d said Mr. Beauprez in a statement. \u201cI plan to give him all the challenge he can handle.\u201d\n\nThe same Democratic group is also running an anti-Beauprez ad that criticizes the former congressman for supporting \u201cspending bills\u201d while \u201cthe national debt ballooned $2 trillion,\u201d a message obviously designed to resonate with conservatives.\n\nA Magellan Strategies poll released Tuesday by the Beauprez campaign shows Mr. Tancredo with a two-point lead over Mr. Beauprez in the four-candidate primary. Also running are Secretary of State Scott Gessler and former Senate Minority Leader Mike Kopp.\n\nDenver pollster Floyd Ciruli said the Democrats\u2019 goal is \u201cto get not only what they perceive as the weakest candidate against Hickenlooper, but also the candidate that could potentially in their view cause the most damage and be the easiest to attack.\u201d\n\nComplete Colorado reports that Protect Colorado Values has invested $89,000 in running the ads on one Denver television station alone, and has contracted to air the spots on another station.\n\n\u201cI personally believe it is totally unethical, but it\u2019s obviously not illegal, nor is it unique,\u201d said Mr. Ciruli.\n\nThe only Republican who seems to like the television ads is Mr. Tancredo, apart from the line that calls him \u201ctoo conservative for Colorado.\u201d\n\n\u201cWith the exception of the last observation in that ad, everything else they said about me was accurate in terms of my opinion about Obamacare,\u201d said Mr. Tancredo. \u201cSo I\u2019m pretty amazed, excited. In fact, we could cut out that last little phrase and run it ourselves. But why should I? They\u2019re paying hundreds of thousands to do so.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Democrats really don't want former Rep.
