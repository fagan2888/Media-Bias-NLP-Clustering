This year Scardaci is charged with implementing major health reforms, including the rollout of an electronic records system for the county\u2019s behavioral health system and boosting county mental health and substance abuse treatment services, a sector that saw deep cuts during the recession.\n\n\u201cElectronic health records systems allow us to interface with other doctors and nurses, giving us a more complete understanding of the clients we serve,\u201d Scardaci said. \u201cIt\u2019s a big endeavor for us.\u201d\n\nScardaci, who took over the top post at the Department of Health Services in 2005, has overseen programs launched under the Affordable Care Act, including the expansion of Medi-Cal, California\u2019s low-income health program.\n\n\u201cRita\u2019s implementation of the Affordable Health Care act is top on my list,\u201d said Supervisor Shirlee Zane, following Scardaci\u2019s contract renewal. \u201cShe\u2019s also been great at leveraging state and federal funding so we can expand mental health and substance abuse programs.\u201d\n\nScardaci last year led public health initiatives outlining health disparities in Sonoma County, with a goal to increase access for low-income and underserved people. The recent \u201cPortrait of Sonoma County,\u201d released in May, will help drive new programs, Scardaci said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about the impact that education, and income, and health have on individuals,\u201d Scardaci said. \u201cIt outlines areas to improve health outcomes in our community, and that\u2019s where we\u2019re moving.\u201d\n\nScardaci\u2019s 2.5 percent salary increase brings her annual pay to $196,440. Health and human services, funded primarily by the state and federal government, comprise nearly a quarter of Sonoma County\u2019s $1.4 billion budget.\n\nYou can reach Staff Writer Angela Hart at 526-8503 or angela.hart@ pressdemocrat.com.
