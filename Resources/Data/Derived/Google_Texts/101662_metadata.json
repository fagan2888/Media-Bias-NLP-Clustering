According to the Post\u2019s Peter Hermann and Dana Hedgpeth, the Thomas Circle Singers were holding a charity benefit concert when some Grinch sneaked into the church\u2019s basement, went through the choristers\u2019 coats and purses, and made off with 15 debit and credit cards. \u201cWhile we were trying to help people in need we were being robbed,\u201d one singer told the Post. \u201cIt was terribly disappointing. \u2026 We didn\u2019t even think someone would want to do that kind of harm.\u201d\n\nAs a man who has caroled in large groups before and hopes to do so again, this story struck fear into my bass-baritone heart. Whether you\u2019re singing in the so-called sanctuary of some local church or harmonizing on the mean streets of your city or town, you should never forget that street crime doesn\u2019t take a holiday. How can Christmas carolers protect themselves? Here are six suggestions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nDon\u2019t be overcome by the music. It is easy for holiday carolers to become lost in the music they are singing, and imagine the entire world as some joyful and munificent winter wonderland. This is called \u201cletting your guard down,\u201d and you shouldn\u2019t do it. Never forget that Christmas carols are filled with lies, and that you should always remain alert and suspicious even as you are singing songs of love and good cheer. Perhaps also consider adding some crime-conscious carols to your group\u2019s repertoire, like \u201cA Carjacker\u2019s Christmas\u201d or \u201cSanta Got Robbed.\u201d I don\u2019t know if those songs actually exist, but if they don\u2019t, you should write them.\n\nBe aware of your surroundings. If caroling on public streets, keep track of where you\u2019re headed, so that you\u2019ll know if you have inadvertently strayed into a rough neighborhood. Carol during the daylight hours; if you must sing at night, stick to well-lit places. You should also constantly pinch yourself while singing, to remind yourself that the real world can be a cold and painful place. You can also ask the person standing next to you to pinch you every now and then, as long as you make clear that your request is not a sexual thing, but a public safety thing.\n\nKeep your valuables close. The Thomas Circle Singers made a critical mistake by leaving their wallets in an unsecured basement room during their concert. Never do this! Whether you\u2019re singing in a church or in someone else\u2019s home, never presume that your host has taken appropriate safety precautions. You are responsible for your own security. So keep your wallet in your pocket, and if you don\u2019t have a pocket, perhaps consider using a money belt, or one of those around-the-neck thingies that old people use to store their passports when visiting Europe.\n\nTake requests. \u201cGive the people what they want\u201d is a valuable life strategy in general, but it\u2019s especially applicable to holiday caroling outings. If an insistent audience member keeps yelling for \u201cSilent Night,\u201d don\u2019t enrage him by sticking to your set list. Fulfill his request. Make him happy. Take the following maxim to heart: A satisfied audience is an audience that is much less likely to rob you.\n\nLay off the wassail. For many people, a caroling party is less about the music than the wassail, or the eggnog, or the spiked cider, or whatever warm and liquored-up beverage you use as a vocal lubricant. There\u2019s nothing wrong with enjoying some overproof holiday cheer, but don\u2019t overdo it. Not only will excessive wassail consumption cause you to sing off-key, it will also make you less alert and more susceptible to malefactors. Wait until the caroling is concluded before hitting the punch bowl.", "article_metadata": {"fb-share": "Six Ways Christmas Carolers Can Stave Off Attacks by Vicious Criminals", "sailthru.author": "Justin Peters", "description": "The Washington Post published a very un-merry story on Thursday about a group of D.C.-area Christmas carolers whose efforts to spread seasonal cheer we ...", "og": {"site_name": "Slate Magazine", "description": "The Washington Post published a very un-merry story on Thursday about a group of D.C.-area Christmas carolers whose efforts to spread seasonal cheer we ...", "title": "Six Ways Christmas Carolers Can Stave Off Attacks by Vicious Criminals", "url": "http://www.slate.com/blogs/crime/2013/12/20/thomas_circle_singers_six_ways_that_christmas_carolers_can_avoid_being_robbed.html", "image": "http://www.slate.com/content/dam/slate/blogs/crime/2013/12/20/thomas_circle_singers_six_ways_that_christmas_carolers_can_avoid_being_robbed/454268015.jpg.CROP.cq5dam_web_1280_1280_jpeg.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The Washington Post published a very un-merry story on Thursday about a group of D.C.-area Christmas carolers whose efforts to spread seasonal cheer we ...", "title": "Six Ways Christmas Carolers Can Stave Off Attacks by Vicious Criminals", "url": "http://www.slate.com/blogs/crime/2013/12/20/thomas_circle_singers_six_ways_that_christmas_carolers_can_avoid_being_robbed.html", "image": "http://www.slate.com/content/dam/slate/blogs/crime/2013/12/20/thomas_circle_singers_six_ways_that_christmas_carolers_can_avoid_being_robbed/454268015.jpg.CROP.cq5dam_web_1280_1280_jpeg.jpg", "creator": "@justintrevett", "site": "@slate", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2013-12-20T12:23:00Z", "sailthru.promoheadline": "Six Ways Christmas Carolers Can Stave Off Attacks by Vicious Criminals", "sailthru.headline": "Six Ways Christmas Carolers Can Stave Off Attacks by Vicious Criminals", "parsely-page": "{\n  \"title\": \"Six Ways Christmas Carolers Can Stave Off Attacks by Vicious Criminals\",\n  \"link\": \"http://www.slate.com/blogs/crime/2013/12/20/thomas_circle_singers_six_ways_that_christmas_carolers_can_avoid_being_robbed.html\",\n  \"image_url\": \"http://www.slate.com/content/dam/slate/blogs/crime/2013/12/20/thomas_circle_singers_six_ways_that_christmas_carolers_can_avoid_being_robbed/454268015.jpg.CROP.thumbnail-small.jpg\",\n  \"type\": \"post\",\n  \"post_id\": \"230131220001\",\n  \"pub_date\": \"2013-12-20T12:23:00Z\",\n  \"section\": \"News and Politics\",\n  \"author\": \"Justin Peters\",\n  \"tags\": [\n    \"crime\",\n    \"christmas\",\n    \"Christmas Carols\"\n  ]\n}", "fb": {"app_id": 142011022527753}, "tw-line": "Six Ways Christmas Carolers Can Stave Off Attacks by Vicious Criminals", "keywords": "thomas circle singers christmas, thomas circle singers robbed, christmas safety tips, christmas carol safety tips, christmas crime prevention tips, how to avoid being robbed, the little drummer boy hate, santa got robbed", "google-site-verification": "jXqoqqPSmx_PWchRdG-IXu-X616Ee2Ptf_AiElI9LzQ", "sailthru.tags": "thomas circle singers christmas, thomas circle singers robbed, christmas safety tips, christmas carol safety tips, christmas crime prevention tips, how to avoid being robbed, the little drummer boy hate, santa got robbed", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/Slate"}, "sailthru.description": "The Washington Post published a very un-merry story on Thursday about a group of D.C.-area Christmas carolers whose efforts to spread seasonal cheer we ...", "sailthru.image.full": "http://www.slate.com/content/dam/slate/blogs/crime/2013/12/20/thomas_circle_singers_six_ways_that_christmas_carolers_can_avoid_being_robbed/454268015.jpg.CROP.cq5dam_web_1280_1280_jpeg.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdfe69\"", "article_summary": "How can Christmas carolers protect themselves?\nWhether you\u2019re singing in a church or in someone else\u2019s home, never presume that your host has taken appropriate safety precautions.\n\u201cGive the people what they want\u201d is a valuable life strategy in general, but it\u2019s especially applicable to holiday caroling outings.\nPhoto by Paul Gilham/Getty ImagesThe Washington Post published a very un-merry story on Thursday about a group of D.C.-area Christmas carolers whose efforts to spread seasonal cheer were recently thwarted.\nThere\u2019s nothing wrong with enjoying some overproof holiday cheer, but don\u2019t overdo it."}
