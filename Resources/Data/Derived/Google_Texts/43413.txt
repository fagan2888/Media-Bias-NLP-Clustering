Now more than ever you’re going to want to appear indispensable to your employer. While the concern used to be an employer finding someone more efficient than you and letting you go, these days you need to worry about R2D2 taking your job.

For example, Google started developing autonomous driverless cars in 2010 and plans to introduce them to the public by 2020.
