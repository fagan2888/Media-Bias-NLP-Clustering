Mario Diaz-Balart and Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) on April 23, 2014 in Doral, Florida. The protesters wanted to ask the politicians if they still want to repeal their constituents health care now that more than 8 million Americans have signed up for health insurance under the Affordable Care Act.

During that time, Republicans in the U.S. House have voted dozens of times to repeal, defund or dismantle it. Never have they voted on a bill to replace the health reform law. Now we know why: They\u2019re still working on coming up with a plan.\n\nLast week The Hill reported that a group of senior House Republicans is \u201cmaking headway\u201d in crafting legislation. \u201cGive us a little more time, another month or so,\u201d said House Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Fred Upton, R-Mich. \u201cI think we\u2019ll be pretty close to a Republican alternative.\u201d\n\nUpton is among a four-member task force assigned by House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., to develop an alternative to Obamacare. In December, Ryan vowed to reveal a plan in 2016 that would \u201creplace every word\u201d in the law that has been implemented in every state and insured millions of people. But apparently doing so is more challenging than anticipated. The group is still in \u201clistening mode,\u201d Upton said.\n\nWhen another lawmaker, Rep. Michael Burgess, R-Texas, was asked about replacing the law, he \u201cpretended to hide his face in a bannister in the Capitol building to avoid the question,\u201d The Hill reported.\n\nNow that sounds like the political party this country knows when it comes to offering workable reform that actually insures Americans. Look the other way. Hide. Ignore millions of uninsured people.\n\nIt isn\u2019t a mere six years that Republicans have had to offer a comprehensive plan. They\u2019ve had decades. Under Presidents Ronald Reagan, George Bush, Bill Clinton, and George W. Bush, they did nothing while the number of uninsured Americans grew and spending on health care soared. Even when they had healthy congressional majorities to address the health insurance problems plaguing constituents, they sat on their hands.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until Barack Obama was elected and Democrats held majorities in the House and Senate that reform finally became a reality. Those elected officials had been in \u201clistening mode\u201d for years. They knew uninsured Americans were dying and filing for bankruptcy due to medical bills. They acted. Now people with preexisting health problems can purchase coverage. Their plans cannot be canceled when they get sick. Young people can remain on their parents\u2019 plan into adulthood. The law raised taxes on the wealthy to generate revenue and actually pay for itself.\n\nThough Obamacare is not perfect, Republicans in Congress have refused to make minor legislative tweaks to fix it. They refuse to acknowledge that the law, which relies heavily on private-sector insurers, looks essentially like a model for reform that would have been crafted by conservatives.\n\nInstead, they\u2019ve wasted years fixated on repeal. And apparently they still don\u2019t have anything concrete to replace it. The country, which waited decades for reform, is supposed to just give them some more time. Americans won't be holding their breath.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://dmreg.co/1Szn8hx", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Republicans need \"a little more time\" to come up with their alternative to the health reform law", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600025120", "og": {"site_name": "Des Moines Register", "description": "Republicans need \"a little more time\" to come up with their alternative to the health reform law", "title": "Editorial: Repeal Obamacare and replace with ... nothing?", "url": "http://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/opinion/editorials/2016/04/26/editorial-repeal-obamacare-and-replace-nothing/83499910/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/desmoinesregister.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Republicans need \"a little more time\" to come up with their alternative to the health reform law", "creator": "@DMRegister", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/df98413a770709437c6466f022d986ab80df0232/c=864-0-4320-3456&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/DesMoines/2014/07/07/affordablecareact.jpg", "title": "Editorial: Repeal Obamacare and replace with ... nothing?", "site": "@DMRegister", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "p": {"domain_verify": "372c291dc2b106308d26264f4fba3b10"}, "fb": {"app_id": 169766623060429}, "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Persons/Paul Ryan", "gci-asset-type": "story", "gci-categories": "Persons/Paul Ryan", "title": "Editorial: Repeal Obamacare and replace with ... nothing?", "author": "The Register's Editorial", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "opinion/editorials", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/07685c83f895bf0c6199e8efe706d3aae1292b26/c=1296-0-3888-3456/local/-/media/DesMoines/2014/07/07/affordablecareact.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/ebf1a7a0cbe37ff421bdfb019e9283f02cf642ff/c=864-0-4320-3456/local/-/media/DesMoines/2014/07/07/affordablecareact.jpg", "contenttype": "story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/3a3d056d2f4b50884acd36c237db6d171e941ff0/c=288-0-4896-3456/local/-/media/DesMoines/2014/07/07/affordablecareact.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/2a6573745064622162eb3405ad5bd1daa4942810/c=0-270-5184-3186&r=x1683&c=3200x1680/local/-/media/DesMoines/2014/07/07/affordablecareact.jpg", "publishtime": "2016-04-26T21:44:42.703000-05:00", "shorthed": "Editorial: Repeal, no plan to replace", "articleid": 83499910, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/3658fd42755583d64b04f69690f6d4a6f28401aa/c=0-270-5184-3186/local/-/media/DesMoines/2014/07/07/affordablecareact.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/ed8bc1413d2cc061d591d579e7a65f8870c7ae19/c=1620-0-3564-3456/local/-/media/DesMoines/2014/07/07/affordablecareact.jpg"}}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070"}, "article_summary": "Never have they voted on a bill to replace the health reform law.\nLast week The Hill reported that a group of senior House Republicans is \u201cmaking headway\u201d in crafting legislation.\nDuring that time, Republicans in the U.S. House have voted dozens of times to repeal, defund or dismantle it.\nThey knew uninsured Americans were dying and filing for bankruptcy due to medical bills.\nThe protesters wanted to ask the politicians if they still want to repeal their constituents health care now that more than 8 million Americans have signed up for health insurance under the Affordable Care Act."}
