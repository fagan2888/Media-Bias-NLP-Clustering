When Abramson became executive editor in 2011, her salary was $475,000, or $84,000 less than her male predecessor\u2019s pay that year, Auletta reports. Also, during the three years she served as Washington bureau chief, she made $100,000 less than the man who replaced her in the position. Abramson, 60, recently had her lawyer contact Times management about her concerns of unequal compensation. That move, according to Auletta, only further damaged her relationship with her boss.\n\n>> Sign up for the AARP Money newsletter\n\nThe high-profile firing is likely a point of discussion in human resources offices across the country. \u201cIt is a wake-up call for other employers,\u201d says Sara Rix, a senior strategic policy adviser at the AARP Public Policy Institute. A recent survey by Indiana University found that female journalists make 83 percent of what their male peers make. The pay gap narrows to 6.6 percent when comparing women and men with 20 years of experience. It\u2019s 21.4 percent for workers with 10 to 19 years of experience.\n\nLooking at a wider range of jobs, not just journalism, the pay gap expands. Women working full time earned 77 cents for every $1 a man earned in 2012, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. More recent reports, though, show similar pay for younger men and women \u2013 for now. \u201cYounger women are always starting out at a narrow wage gap and then it widens,\u201d says Ariane Hegewisch, study director for the Washington-based Institute for Women\u2019s Policy Research. Men\u2019s pay progresses fastest between the ages of 25 and 35, Hegewisch says.\n\nMeanwhile, many women ages 25 to 40 interrupt their careers to take time out to raise children, making it difficult for them to catch up on compensation later, she says. \u201cThere are so many things operating [in pay issues], and not many of them are good,\u201d says Rix. For instance, female-dominated fields often pay lower wages. Another issue, Rix says, is that salaries aren\u2019t transparent, so women don\u2019t know that they are being offered less and, thus, don\u2019t negotiate for higher compensation.\n\n>> Get discounts on financial services with your AARP Member Advantages.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) has used Abramson\u2019s dismissal to argue for passage of the Paycheck Fairness Act, a bill that failed in his chamber last month. Among other things, the measure would prevent employers from retaliating against workers for disclosing wages in a complaint or investigation.\n\nPhoto: Ericsphotography/istockphoto\n\nAlso of Interest\n\nSee the AARP home page for deals, savings tips, trivia and more", "article_metadata": {"page_title": "blog", "twitter": {"description": "The abrupt firing this week\u00a0of Jill Abramson, the\u00a0first female executive editor of the\u00a0New York Times,\u00a0once again puts a spotlight on unequal pay between men and women doing similar jobs, as details continue to leak.
