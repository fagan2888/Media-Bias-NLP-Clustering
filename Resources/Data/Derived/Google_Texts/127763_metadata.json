This is the question on the minds of the political press corps. Sure, it\u2019s nice that he\u2019s open to any and all questions from reporters and voters alike, but does he have to answer them with his wishy-washy technocratic details? When\u2019s he going to start calling his opponents terrible names so reporters can sex up their Jeb stories a bit?\n\nEveryone wants to see some blood. The hope, now that Bush is tumbling from presumed frontrunner status, is that he\u2019ll be forced to mix it up a little instead of responding to questions with, say, a critique of the wording in subclause 2(b)(ii) of some education bill from 1995. The further you tumble from contention, the more you have to resort to weird humiliating stunts to get attention in this field of dozens of candidates.\n\nAnd there\u2019s no better place to start getting nasty than at Walt Disney World. Florida Gov. Rick Scott, a malevolent ghoul straight out of the German folk stories on which most classic Disney movies are based, held an economic summit yesterday at the sweltering Orlando money-suck where dreams come true. Bush, finally on some friendly turf, used the occasion \u201cto more forcefully attack opponents\u201d than he\u2019s previously been willing to do, according to the Washington Post. \u201cBush has mostly avoided sparring with Republican contenders,\u201d the Post writes, \u201csaying that he\u2019s not yet an official candidate and is eager to be a \u2018joyful\u2019 alternative for voters upset by partisan warfare. But that strategy doesn\u2019t appear to be working.\u201d\n\nAlright, so give us the skinny: what did he say? Did he call Scott Walker a dingdong? Did he throw a trash can at Ted Cruz? Did he literally murder Mike Huckabee?\n\nEhh, not really. He made the bold decision \u2014 you\u2019ll never believe this \u2014 to criticize Rand Paul on national security. He said that Paul was \u201cwrong about the Patriot Act.\u201d Bam! \u201cHe also delivered his most personal swipe yet at Rubio,\u201d the Post writes, \u201cin response to the senator\u2019s suggestions earlier in the day that Republicans should elect younger leaders.\u201d Okay, let\u2019s see this uppercut: \u201cIt\u2019s kind of hard to imagine that my good friend Marco would be critical of his good friend Jeb,\u201d Bush said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The press is desperate to see Jeb Bush start viciously trashing his opponents.
