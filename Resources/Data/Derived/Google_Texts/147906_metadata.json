Bush\u2019s administration, and has steadily declined in virtually every economic, industry and social policy sector, according to a study by the Center for Responsive Politics (CRP). Nearly 1,800 lobbyists stopped reporting their activities with Congress or the federal government between 2012 and 2013.\n\nRelated: Lobbyists Take a Financial Hit with Do-Nothing Congress\n\nYet roughly half those lobbyists have today gone \u201cunderground\u201d while still plying their trade, according to the CRP. They\u2019ve done this by changing their titles at their firms or working more informally without registering with Congress or federal agencies.\n\nAnd with President Obama\u2019s increased use of executive orders to advance his policy objectives in his second term, a fair number of those lobbyists can be found these days meeting behind the scenes with White House officials, trying to influence a raft of pending administrative decisions.\n\nOn Monday The New York Times reported that ever since Obama declared his intention of using executive orders to reshape immigration policy, \u201cthe process of drafting\u201d that policy \u201chas been conducted essentially behind closed doors, where lobbyists and interest groups invited to the White House are making their case out of public view.\u201d\n\nIn some cases, pro-immigration organizations have been pressing for unilateral action by the president on a wide range of issues \u2013 from granting certain categories of illegal immigrants a temporary \u201cparole in place\u201d designation to remain in this country, to massively expanding a 2012 administration directive granting work permits and deportation deferments to young immigrants or \u201cdreamers,\u201d according to The Times report.\n\nRelated: Voters Know What We Should Do on Immigration\n\nWhat\u2019s more, business groups and the Associated Builders and Contractors are making their cases privately against a new executive order that would block companies with a history of workplace violations from receiving federal contracts, The Times reported.\n\nThis flurry of secretive negotiations between largely faceless White House operatives and lobbyists whose work is increasingly done in the shadows is a troubling byproduct of the declining importance of Congress and Obama\u2019s rapidly expanding use of executive orders.\n\n\u201cIn the beginning there were questions about whether this [shift to increased executive action] would distance lobbyists from the policy-making process,\u201d said Sarah Bryner, research director of the Center for Responsive Politics. \u201cBut as we have documented, it seems to be the case that the industry has continued to do what they have always done \u2013 they just have moved off the public record.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is certainly not helpful for citizens who are interested in paying attention to what goes on in Washington,\u201d she added.\n\nRelated: House Greenlights Boehner\u2019s Lawsuit Against Obama\n\nObama took office in 2009 vowing to bring greater transparency to the government process and voicing disdain for lobbyists of all political stripes. On the campaign trail in Las Vegas before he was elected, Obama said, \u201cI\u2019m in this race to tell the lobbyists in Washington that their days of setting the agenda are over. They have not funded my campaign. They will not work in my White House.\u201d\n\nHe said he did not want to appoint to government agencies or to the White House staff anyone who was directly involved in lobbying, regardless of their support for his campaign or regardless of their previous government experience.\n\nBut things changed. Since parting company with GOP congressional leaders on most matters and pursuing a go-it-alone approach, the president and his advisers appear far more comfortable inviting lobbyists and special interest groups to the White House to hash out policy differences behind closed doors. And the administration has relaxed some of its rules to allow lobbyists to serve on committees and task forces.\n\nJennifer Friedman, a White House spokesperson, told The Times that in pursuing a new approach to policymaking, the administration \u201chas engaged a wide range of stakeholders and solicited input from groups and individuals representing a diverse set of views.\u201d\n\nRelated: \u2018Do-Nothing Congress\u2019 Gets Ready for An Unearned 5-Week Vacation\n\nAt the same time, many lobbyists have taken steps to lower their profiles in Washington, making it that much more difficult to track their activities and who they are representing.\n\nThis shift was influenced in part by the enactment in September 2007 of the Honest Leadership and Open Government act. The act strengthened public disclosure requirements on lobbying activities and fundraising.\n\nThe law was passed in the wake of the Jack Abramoff lobbying and influence peddling scandal. But a bad economy and a dearth of serious legislation have hastened the departure of some lobbyists as well.\n\nAnd just as the number of front-line lobbyists has declined in recent years, so has the amount of money being spent to influence legislation \u2013 or so it seems.\n\nLobbying spending by special interests hit a five-year low in 2013, according to the CRP \u2013 totaling $3.24 billion from the previous high of $3.55 billion in 2010.\n\nHowever, The Washington Post and other news organizations have reported that the decline in part reflects a growing trend away from traditional lobbying tactics and toward \u201csoft lobbying,\u201d rendering expenditures far less visible. Special-interest money funneled through non-profit groups, think tanks and grassroots organizations are not subject to federal disclosure rules.\n\n\u201cI think that this move toward lobbying, but by a different name, has resulted in less disclosure, and that\u2019s unfortunate,\u201d said CRP\u2019s Bryner.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Some say the once-formidable army of Washington lobbyists is dramatically shrinking in an era of a \u201cdo-nothing Congress.\u201d Yet roughly half those lobbyists have \u201cgone underground\u201d while still plying their trade \u2013 and many are meeting behind closed doors with the Obama administration to negotiate terms of new executive orders.", "title": "White House Negotiates with \u2018Underground\u2019 Lobbyists on Executive Orders", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/08/20/White-House-Negotiates-Underground-Lobbyists-Executive-Orders", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/04112013_White_House_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/08/20/White-House-Negotiates-Underground-Lobbyists-Executive-Orders", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/04112013_White_House_article.jpg", "creator": "@ericpianin", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Some say the once-formidable army of Washington lobbyists is dramatically shrinking in an era of a \u201cdo-nothing Congress.\u201d Yet roughly half those lobbyists have \u201cgone underground\u201d while still plying their trade \u2013 and many are meeting behind closed doors with the Obama administration to negotiate terms of new executive orders.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Some say that the once-formidable army of Washington lobbyists is dramatically shrinking in an era of a \u201cdo-nothing Congress\u201d that is passing little legislation of real substance.\nRelated: Lobbyists Take a Financial Hit with Do-Nothing CongressYet roughly half those lobbyists have today gone \u201cunderground\u201d while still plying their trade, according to the CRP.\nThis flurry of secretive negotiations between largely faceless White House operatives and lobbyists whose work is increasingly done in the shadows is a troubling byproduct of the declining importance of Congress and Obama\u2019s rapidly expanding use of executive orders.\nNearly 1,800 lobbyists stopped reporting their activities with Congress or the federal government between 2012 and 2013.\nAnd with President Obama\u2019s increased use of executive orders to advance his policy objectives in his second term, a fair number of those lobbyists can be found these days meeting behind the scenes with White House officials, trying to influence a raft of pending administrative decisions."}
