Ebsco Capital Buys PE-Backed All Current Electrical

The deal marks an exit for High Road Capital Partners

Ebsco Industries Inc. has acquired All Current Electrical Sales Inc. from High Road Capital Partners.

All Current resells electrical parts, including fuses and cable fittings, that are used for the commercial and industrial markets. Terms of the deal, which closed Feb. 17 and was announced Feb. 24, were not disclosed.

Ebsco made the deal through a new investment division, Ebsco Capital. The Birmingham, Alabama-based business is looking to acquire and grow middle-market companies and has about $300 million committed to making new investments. Ebsco Industries is a conglomerate made up of more than 40 businesses.

Under High Road, All Current increased its private-label electrical parts offerings. The selling PE firm, headquartered in New York, manages more than $470 million in committed capital. High Road looks to invest in companies with revenues between $10 million and $100 million, and Ebitda between $3 million and $10 million. The firmÂ’s most recent deal was the exit of Handi Quilter in December 2014. For more with the firm, watch our video interview with managing partner Rich Prestegaard.
