But the DOL\u2019s impending changes to the overtime exemption rules may be exactly that.\n\nAs if that wasn\u2019t stressful enough, you\u2019ll have far less time to prepare for the fallout of the overtime rule changes than Obamacare gave you.\n\nThe new rules won\u2019t be phased in over the course of a decade like the ACA\u2019s mandates. All signs point to the overtime rules taking effect before the end of 2016.\n\nThey\u2019ll affect 2016 budget, staff plans\n\nThat means the time to start prepping is now, since the overtime rules will affect your budget and staffing plans for the 2016 calendar year.\n\nAnd even without the final rules in hand yet (the comment period for the proposed rules just ended), there are steps employers would be wise to take now to brace for them \u2014 no matter what form the rules ultimately take:\n\n1. Audit employees\u2019 work hours\n\nAs you know, the DOL\u2019s poised to raise the minimum salary threshold to be exempt from overtime to $50,440. So the first step is calculating how many hours your employees who earn less than that are actually working.\n\nReason: You don\u2019t want to assume they work 40 hours per week only to be blindsided by the fact that they actually work 50 hours per week after the rule changes have reclassified those employees as non-exempt.\n\nNext, you\u2019ll want to weigh the cost of giving raises to those under, but near, the threshold \u2014 and who are most likely to work more than 40 hours per week \u2014 to avoid overtime obligations.\n\nNote: The DOL may allow you to count nondiscretionary bonuses, and possibly commissions, toward 10% of workers\u2019 salary levels. That may help to drag a few of your fence-sitters over the threshold without you having to give them a raise. But we won\u2019t know until the final rules are issued.\n\n2. Assess the effect on benefits offerings\n\nOne question you\u2019ll want to ask yourself: Will being reclassified as non-exempt make some employees no long eligible for certain benefits that they once had?\n\nIf so, do you want to change your benefits plans to enable those workers to keep their benefits \u2014 or might you want to eliminate those benefits to make up for any costs resulting from having to now pay those workers overtime?\n\n3. Expand time-tracking\n\nNo matter how you slice it, companies\u2019 non-exempt employee populations are about to swell.\n\nThat will require expanding systems to track more workers\u2019 hours to ensure proper overtime pay.\n\nIt couldn\u2019t hurt to visit with your tech department now to start discussing ways to implement or expand time-tracking systems.\n\n4. Revisiting remote work arrangements\n\nIt\u2019s time to ask yourself what the rule changes could mean for remote work \u2014 checking work email, taking phone calls after hours, etc.\n\nYou can dissuade or even prohibit non-exempt employees from doing these things after hours all you want. But here\u2019s the bottom line: Some are still going to do it \u2014 and when they do, you need a way to track that work time and compensate them for it.\n\nAgain, get together with your IT folks to determine the best ways to track employees\u2019 after-hours/at-home work.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that the DOL, in its Spring 2015 Regulatory Agenda, said it\u2019s seeking information on \u201c\u2026 [T]he use of technology, including portable electronic devices, by employees away from the workplace and outside of scheduled work hours \u2026\u201d\n\nAs a result, expect some rulemaking on this subject as well \u2014 like perhaps a definition of what qualifies as \u201cde minimis\u201d work.\n\nCurrently, the FLSA does say that \u201cde minimis\u201d work (typically five minutes or less) done beyond the 40-hour workweek by non-exempt employees is not compensable.\n\nHowever, the common practice of workers reading and responding to emails off the clock on their smartphones has complicated the issue of \u201cde minimis\u201d work.\n\n5. Create a communication plan\n\nIf you\u2019re not going to raise some workers\u2019 salaries \u2014 and they\u2019re about to be reclassified as non-exempt \u2014 you need a plan in place for how you\u2019ll break this likely upsetting news to them.\n\nSome issues you\u2019ll need to tackle:\n\nPunching a clock. More workers are going to have to do it, and it may seem like a demotion. How will you explain why it\u2019s now necessary?\n\nMore workers are going to have to do it, and it may seem like a demotion. How will you explain why it\u2019s now necessary? Loss of flexibility. For your current salaried workers, being turned into hourly employees means taking time off to go to the doctor or attend a child\u2019s event could result in less pay. Again, how will you break this news to them? And will you let them make up the time?\n\n6. Prepare for changes to the duties test\n\nIt appears the DOL may eliminate the \u201cconcurrent duties\u201d rule and require employees to spend more than 50% of their time exclusively on exempt duties for them to maintain an exempt classification.\n\nAssume those changes will be adopted and you could avoid unpleasant surprises down the road.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"description": "It would be hard for any regulatory change to be as impactful as the passage of the Affordable Care Act.
