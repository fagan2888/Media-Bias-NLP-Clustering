To the editor: In case anyone is still wondering why Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders has struck such a chord with the voters in this country, one has only to read The Times' article about Blue Shield's decision to increase compensation 64% for its most senior executives â€” some of whom already earn millions of dollars a year. ("Big hike in executive pay at nonprofit Blue Shield draws state scrutiny," Sept. 1)

This comes at a time when the company has been raising premiums on its customers in spite of having billions in surplus cash and a continuing windfall of millions of new customers from the Affordable Care Act.

Anyone want to take a guess as to whether or not the company's rank-and-file employees got a 64% increase in their paychecks?

To the editor: Oh, the irony: Two stories on the front page portend rate hikes for unsuspecting consumers whose biggest crime was obeying authority by conserving water and buying health insurance.

Water rates will probably rise because revenue is dropping as consumption drops. Long-neglected infrastructure compounds the situation, as executives will surely convince the California Public Utilities Commission that the consumer must pay for upgrades to the system.

And regarding Blue Shield, the cost of medical insurance will rise as more people seek coverage and the smarmiest guys in the room get wealthier. In both cases, high-level compensation is the elephant in the room.

It is past time to publicize bonus packages and fine those who receive them directly for infrastructure failures and creative accounting.
