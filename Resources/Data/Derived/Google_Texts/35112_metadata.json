U.S. planners were hopeful that this transfer would occur in the months after April\u2019s election. But this is a troubling assumption, according to Michael Rubin of the American Enterprise Institute. The April election is only the start of the presidential race. It\u2019s likely to last for months after that, keeping the Americans in country even longer.\n\n\u201cEven if the election is in April, that\u2019s the first round [in Afghanistan],\u201d Rubin said. \u201cWe may be talking about June or September before we know who the next president is.\u201d\n\nThe entire election would be delayed, Rubin added, if one of the dozens of presidential candidates is assassinated before the contest. This might seem a distant possibility to most Americans \u2013 but political assassinations in Afghanistan are common.\n\nLess than two months ago, the Taliban took the life of Logar Governor Arsala Jamal. Hanifa Safi, the provincial head of the Afghan ministry of women's affairs, was also killed last summer.\n\n\u201cIf there\u2019s an assassination of any candidate \u2013 and there are dozens of candidates from all over the country \u2013 then, by the Afghan constitution, it delays everything,\u201d said Rubin. \u201cIf someone \u2018offs\u2019 that random guy from some far-flung province, everything gets put on hold.\u201d\n\nRelated: This Unnoticed Law Could Cut Billions to Afghanistan\n\nThe latest delay in negotiations, combined with the prospect of election violence, underscores an uncomfortable truth for American politicians and military planners. Despite the Afghanistan war\u2019s unpopularity, the planned withdrawal of the majority of American troops is at risk without a radical change in policy between now and next summer.\n\nRight now, there are 68,000 U.S. troops in Afghanistan. Pentagon spokesperson Elissa Smith said that half of these troops would be removed by next February.\n\n\u201cAs the president announced, we will withdraw to 34,000 U.S. troops in Afghanistan by February 2014. These troops have been and continue to be removed in a phased approach, managed by the commander on the ground and the military chain of command,\u201d she said.\n\nNo decisions on long-term troop numbers, however, have been made.\n\n\u201cThe [bilateral security agreement or BSA] does not address the number of U.S. forces that may be present in Afghanistan after 2014, nor does it commit us to have forces in Afghanistan,\u201d said Smith. \u201cThe president has not yet made any decisions about how many U.S. troops to keep in Afghanistan after 2014, if the BSA is approved.\u201d\n\nIf the timeline does shift, tens of thousands of American lives could remain at risk. It also means that tens of billions of dollars beyond what the U.S. had already planned to spend would be spent. This would occur despite the fact that the American people and politicians have long grown war-weary.\n\n\u201cThe concern \u2026 is that the patience of the American Congress and the American people might be wearing thin,\u201d said Austin Long, an assistant professor of international affairs at Columbia University.\n\nBillions at Risk\n\nThe U.S. is expected to spend $32 billion in Afghanistan next year, according to official estimates. In earlier reports, The Fiscal Times estimated that the total savings of the so-called \u201czero option\u201d \u2013 or pulling out of Afghanistan completely \u2013 would total $111 billion.\n\nYet the evolving negotiations over the long-term security deal changes the fiscal picture. Without significant policy changes, and as the security agreement remains unsigned, the size and scope of U.S. operations are impossible to estimate.\n\nWhat\u2019s clear however is that any prolonged deployment is going to be expensive. Right now, the Pentagon is spending $5.9 billion per month. At this rate, an additional year would cost $70.8 billion.\n\nPolicy Changes Afoot?\n\nRight now, military planners, diplomats and politicians are trying to determine if this policy should change, according to Long. He said that Iraq provides important historic perspective. The 2006 midterm elections showed that the American public had grown tired of the war in Iraq. Politicians recognized this and adjusted policy accordingly, getting U.S. troops and money out of harm\u2019s way by the end of that decade.\n\nNow, the U.S. refuses to intervene with boots on the ground as Iraq descends into chaos. Diplomats, staff and military brass working in Afghanistan do not want the same thing to happen there, Long said.\n\n\u201cThe folks in Afghanistan at the senior level don\u2019t want it to come to that. We sunk so much into this. We can salvage something out of it with a minor commitment,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe patience in D.C. is pretty thin, both in the executive and in the legislature,\u201d Long added. \u201cIt\u2019s a real possibility we may end up with a situation like Iraq.\u201d\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The long-term security deal between the United States and Afghanistan is in danger of failing.
