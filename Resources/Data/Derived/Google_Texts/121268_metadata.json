Literally! Depending on the data you look at, between 20 and 22 percent of its total population lacks health insurance. That is terrible for those approximately one million very poor Texans who don\u2019t have any health insurance, plus another few million moderately poor who also don\u2019t have it. But fortunately, those poors have a former Republican governor named Rick Perry who really likes to travel to Iowa and New Hampshire and talk to the media, as you do when you\u2019re gunning to be a two-time presidential nomination loser. Rick Perry would like you to know that Texans are actually delighted to be uninsured.\n\nIn a recent interview with the New Hampshire Journal, Perry said, \u201cTexas has been criticized for having a large number of uninsured, but that\u2019s what Texans wanted. They did not want a large government program forcing everyone to purchase insurance.\u201d\n\nHmm, we aren\u2019t sure if it\u2019s strictly true that low-income Texans don\u2019t want health coverage although it\u2019s possible they might say they don\u2019t want Obamacare because it\u2019s socialism. But we are sure that during his tenure as governor, Perry decided not to expand the Texas Medicaid program, even though that meant a million very poor Texans fell into what is called the Medicaid expansion gap. What\u2019s the expansion gap? It\u2019s when you make too much money to qualify for Medicaid (you make more than $4,500 per year) and you are also too poor to qualify for subsidies to afford to buy insurance (you make less than $11,670). If you\u2019re a Texan and you\u2019re in this coverage gap, you\u2019re pretty poor, and as Rick Perry says, you have exactly what you wanted \u2013 no health insurance!\n\nAbout five million other Texans are uninsured who are not in the coverage gap. Some are eligible for subsidies but haven\u2019t gotten around to buying coverage. Some are Medicaid-eligible kids whose parents or guardians might not know they\u2019re eligible. Some are undocumented immigrants who will never, ever, ever be eligible for health insurance in U.S. America, because have you looked at your Congress lately? Some are morons who could afford insurance but aren\u2019t buying it because ObamaBenghaziAbortionGays, and yeah, this group probably legit enjoys being uninsured, plus their tinfoil hats are protecting them from measles.\n\nHey, maybe the new Republican Governor of Texas, Greg Abbott, will expand Medicaid or help low-income people access their ACA benefits! Haha, no. Abbott flirted with being health insurance-curious for a few minutes, but it didn\u2019t take. Uninsured low-income Texans will have to just keep on being psyched to be uninsured, because having health insurance takes away all of your freedom, as Ayn Rand pointed out when she wrote the Constitution. If low-income people are so happy not to have insurance, doesn\u2019t this make you wonder why most higher-income people have it? It is because rich people hate freedom.\n\n[Salon/KFF/MSNBC/NRO]", "article_metadata": {"description": "In terms of health insurance coverage rates, Texas is the worst. Literally!
