When asked during a debate what he planned to do after repealing the Affordable Care Act, Trump responded by saying he would create something \u201cwonderful,\u201d and allow the sale of insurance across state lines.Establishing a \u201cnational market\u201d for health insurance remains a popular idea among Republicans, and supporters say the removal of state barriers will create more competition and bring down the cost of health insurance.However, Kaiser Health News\u2019 Julie Rovner said the idea is not so simple.In the first of a series of videos called \u201cSounds Like a Good Idea,\u201d Rovner examines interstate selling \u2013 a proposal that has been around since at least 2005 \u2013 by looking at three states that already allow it: Georgia, Maine and Wyoming.Despite these allowances, and the agreement to it in the Affordable Care Act, \u201cnot a single insurance company has offered to sell a product approved in one state to people in another state,\u201d Rovner says.Why not?For one thing, complicated policies designed to limit costs make it difficult to create \u201cone size fits all\u201d policies that work in multiple areas \u2013 particularly due to network limitations.\u201cIf you\u2019re in Florida and you want to buy a plan from North Dakota, it\u2019s unlikely that North Dakota plan will have many healthcare options for you in the Sunshine State,\u201d she said.Yet the idea remains popular. Proponents say creating a national market would allow consumers to save money by buying cheaper insurance plans from states that require fewer benefits, which translates to less expensive premiums.The Affordable Care Act did cut back on these differences between states by creating minimum standards of care, but most Republican plans \u2013 including Trump\u2019s \u2013 count on the repeal of the health law.Rovner and other detractors, however, say this plan would actually incite a \u201crace to the bottom\u201d in which the insurance industry would come to resemble the credit card industry, with carriers moving to states with the loosest regulations on benefits and sales practices.\u201cThat could draw the healthier people out of their home states, leaving behind sicker people and causing insurance premiums there to rise,\u201d Rovner said. \u201cThat could put consumers on the hook if something happened.\u201dRegulatory issues would also be difficult. If a patient wanted to make a complaint regarding an out-of-state insurance policy, he or she would find their insurance commissioner powerless to do anything about it.\u201cIn short, selling insurance across state lines sounds like it would be a good idea, but it hasn\u2019t worked so far,\u201d she said.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.ibamag.com/news/the-problem-with-selling-health-insurance-across-state-lines-31937.aspx", "image": {"width": 200, "identifier": "http://www.ibamag.com/files/image/iStock_health-insur-financial-bills-medical_000079278591_Small.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "height": 200}, "site_name": "Insurance Business", "description": "It\u2019s a commonly cited Republican talking point \u2013 and one of Donald Trump\u2019s favorites \u2013 but evidence suggests there\u2019s a hitch", "title": "The problem with selling health insurance across state lines"}, "twitter": {"description": "It\u2019s a commonly cited Republican talking point \u2013 and one of Donald Trump\u2019s favorites \u2013 but evidence suggests there\u2019s a hitch", "title": "The problem with selling health insurance across state lines", "url": "http://www.ibamag.com/news/the-problem-with-selling-health-insurance-across-state-lines-31937.aspx", "image": "http://www.ibamag.com/files/image/iStock_health-insur-financial-bills-medical_000079278591_Small.jpg", "site": "@InsuranceBizUS", "card": "summary"}, "description": "It\u2019s a commonly cited Republican talking point \u2013 and one of Donald Trump\u2019s favorites \u2013 but evidence suggests there\u2019s a hitch", "author": "Caitlin Bronson"}, "article_summary": "Presumed Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump hasn\u2019t exactly been forthcoming in his plans for the US health insurance market.\nIf a patient wanted to make a complaint regarding an out-of-state insurance policy, he or she would find their insurance commissioner powerless to do anything about it.\u201cIn short, selling insurance across state lines sounds like it would be a good idea, but it hasn\u2019t worked so far,\u201d she said.\n\u201cThat could put consumers on the hook if something happened.\u201dRegulatory issues would also be difficult.\nProponents say creating a national market would allow consumers to save money by buying cheaper insurance plans from states that require fewer benefits, which translates to less expensive premiums.The Affordable Care Act did cut back on these differences between states by creating minimum standards of care, but most Republican plans \u2013 including Trump\u2019s \u2013 count on the repeal of the health law.Rovner and other detractors, however, say this plan would actually incite a \u201crace to the bottom\u201d in which the insurance industry would come to resemble the credit card industry, with carriers moving to states with the loosest regulations on benefits and sales practices.\u201cThat could draw the healthier people out of their home states, leaving behind sicker people and causing insurance premiums there to rise,\u201d Rovner said.\nWhen asked during a debate what he planned to do after repealing the Affordable Care Act, Trump responded by saying he would create something \u201cwonderful,\u201d and allow the sale of insurance across state lines.Establishing a \u201cnational market\u201d for health insurance remains a popular idea among Republicans, and supporters say the removal of state barriers will create more competition and bring down the cost of health insurance.However, Kaiser Health News\u2019 Julie Rovner said the idea is not so simple.In the first of a series of videos called \u201cSounds Like a Good Idea,\u201d Rovner examines interstate selling \u2013 a proposal that has been around since at least 2005 \u2013 by looking at three states that already allow it: Georgia, Maine and Wyoming.Despite these allowances, and the agreement to it in the Affordable Care Act, \u201cnot a single insurance company has offered to sell a product approved in one state to people in another state,\u201d Rovner says.Why not?For one thing, complicated policies designed to limit costs make it difficult to create \u201cone size fits all\u201d policies that work in multiple areas \u2013 particularly due to network limitations.\u201cIf you\u2019re in Florida and you want to buy a plan from North Dakota, it\u2019s unlikely that North Dakota plan will have many healthcare options for you in the Sunshine State,\u201d she said.Yet the idea remains popular."}
