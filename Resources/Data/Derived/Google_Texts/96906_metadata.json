David DiSano, a sheriff\u2019s public information officer.\n\nDeputies located the fishermen\u2019s boat in approximately 13 feet of water off the east coast of the lake late Thursday afternoon, the sheriff\u2019s office said.\n\nThe families of both men, Willie Hightower, 64, and Willie Ragins, 43, were notified, he said. Investigators are unsure what led to the accident, but DiSano said there is no indication of anything suspicious.\n\n\u201cIt was a very unfortunate incident,\u201d he said. \u201cThe families have been here three or four days now.\u201d\n\nTeronica Dixon, Ragins\u2019 sister-in-law, said the waiting had been \u201cterrible, terrible; it\u2019s not explainable.\u201d At least now there is an ending, Dixon said, though not the one her sister and Ragins\u2019 wife, Salesia Ragins, wanted.\n\n\u201cMy sister will be at ease and at peace,\u201d Dixon said. \u201cShe can take him home and put him to rest.\u201d\n\nDixon said her sister last talked to Ragins by phone about 10:20 p.m. Saturday and he said he expected to be home in a couple of hours. He never showed and by the next morning a worried Salesia Ragins was checking with hospitals and finally called the sheriff\u2019s office, Dixon said.\n\nDeputies found Ragins\u2019 green pickup truck parked near Lake Tarpon in Anderson Park, off U.S. 19 and a search of the lake began.\n\nOn Sunday, search crews recovered two coolers from the northern part of the lake, along with a chair attached to a post, a tackle box and life jacket. On Monday, crews located a red gas can and small red Thermos.\n\nAlso on Monday, searchers used vessels with sonar devices that offer a three-dimensional view of the bottom of the lake.\n\nRagins\u2019 pickup, with a boat trailer hitched to it, was still in the Anderson Park parking lot Wednesday evening as darkness set in and members of both men\u2019s families waited for any additional information from deputies after the bodies were found.\n\nDixon said her sister and Ragins had been together 25 years and married for 21 of those years. They have four children and six grandchildren, she said.\n\nHer brother-in-law loved to fish, she said, so a weekend excursion on Lake Tarpon was not unusual. She said the ordeal had been hard on the families of both men.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re here for both of them,\u2019 Dixon said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t want it to end like this.\u201d\n\nrblair@tampatrib.com\n\n(813) 371-1853\n\nTwitter: @RBlairTBO", "article_metadata": {"taboola-pub-time": "Wed, 01 Jan 2014 17:25:06 -0400", "Description": "TARPON SPRINGS \u2014 The bodies of the two Plant City fishermen missing on Lake Tarpon since Saturday night were found Wednesday afternoon, putting an end to a search that had been going on for fou", "og": {"site_name": "TBO.com", "description": "TARPON SPRINGS \u2014 The bodies of the two Plant City fishermen missing on Lake Tarpon since Saturday night were found Wednesday afternoon, putting an end to a search that had been going on for fou", "title": "Searchers locate bodies, boat of missing fishermen in Lake Tarpon", "url": "http://www.tbo.com/news/breaking-news/searchers-locate-bodies-of-missing-fishermen-in-lake-tarpon-20140101/", "image": {"width": 3264, "identifier": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20140101/ARTICLE/140109939/EP/1/1/EP-140109939.jpg", "height": 2448}, "updated_time": "2014-01-02T17:21:00Z-04", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "tbo.com", "description": "TARPON SPRINGS \u2014 The bodies of the two Plant City fishermen missing on Lake Tarpon since Saturday night were found Wednesday afternoon, putting an end to a search that had been going on for f", "title": "Searchers locate bodies, boat of missing fishermen in Lake Tarpon", "image": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20140101/ARTICLE/140109939/AR/0/AR-140109939.jpg", "site": "@TBOcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 522234267826834}, "msvalidate.01": "29E67031F86E7FB6DF9823924E21B8B4", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/tbocom", "published_time": "2014-01-01T17:25:06Z-04", "modified_time": "2014-01-02T17:21:00Z-04"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdfbf1\"", "article_summary": "Her brother-in-law loved to fish, she said, so a weekend excursion on Lake Tarpon was not unusual.\nDeputies found Ragins\u2019 green pickup truck parked near Lake Tarpon in Anderson Park, off U.S. 19 and a search of the lake began.\nDeputies located the fishermen\u2019s boat in approximately 13 feet of water off the east coast of the lake late Thursday afternoon, the sheriff\u2019s office said.\nTARPON SPRINGS \u2014 The bodies of the two Plant City fishermen missing on Lake Tarpon since Saturday night were found Wednesday afternoon, putting an end to a search that had been going on for four days, the Pinellas County Sheriff\u2019s Office reported.\nHe never showed and by the next morning a worried Salesia Ragins was checking with hospitals and finally called the sheriff\u2019s office, Dixon said."}
