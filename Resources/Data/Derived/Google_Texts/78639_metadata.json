He\u2019s not blaming the tour or the cars that stopped abruptly before he crashed through the back window of a team car. He\u2019s grateful to be alive, grateful for the care he received. And he\u2019s doing everything in his power to return to the sport he loves.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not dwelling on the accident,\u201d Crane said. \u201cIt was something that happened. It\u2019s kind of the cards I was dealt. I\u2019m making sure I control everything I can, to the best of my power, to help me heal and get back to where I want to get back to.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s even concerned about the impact his crash has had on other people, so he projects this incredible attitude intentionally.\n\n\u201cI think that will help a lot of people who have some emotional issues with this,\u201d Crane said. \u201cI\u2019m all right and I\u2019m progressing and I\u2019m on my way back to normal. It\u2019s an incredible sport, and the community of cycling has been absolutely incredible in supporting me through all this. I\u2019ve had some racers who I don\u2019t even know reach out to me, and cycling fans have reached out to me with their support. It\u2019s a sign of how special this sport is. I am really grateful for all of the support I\u2019ve gotten.\u201d\n\nCrane has surprised doctors with the pace of his recovery, but his sister Tela \u2014 also a cyclist \u2014 says he has a \u201clong road ahead of him\u201d in rehab. Among his injuries were a broken bone in his skull and a deep brain injury.\n\n\u201cWhat is helpful for me is to see that old side of Ian, he\u2019s stubborn and he wants to get back to where he was,\u201d Tela said. \u201cHe\u2019s working really hard at his rehab. He recognizes it is a long road, but he is committed to doing the best possible at his rehab training. He can\u2019t quite ride his bike yet but he can get really good at doing all of this rehab work so he can be in the best possible place when he can get back on his bike.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be while before he\u2019s cleared to ride outdoors and drive and things like that, just because of the brain injury, but he\u2019s already making plans with his coach for his indoor training this fall. He\u2019ll be spending a lot of time on the trainer, it sounds like, just to make sure he can be in a place where he could resume his career next season. That\u2019s the goal right now.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Cycling,Injuries,USA Pro Challenge", "language": "en, sv", "og": {"site_name": "All Things Colorado Sports", "description": "Ian Crane has maintained a positive and determined outlook since crashing on the last day of the USA Pro Challenge.", "title": "Cyclist Ian Crane focusing on recovery, not dwelling on accident", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/sports/2014/09/23/cyclist-ian-cranes-attitude-toward-crash-recovery-refreshing/26830/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/sports/files/2014/09/ian-crane.jpg", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "description": "Ian Crane has maintained a positive and determined outlook since crashing on the last day of the USA Pro Challenge.", "creator": "@johnmeyer", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/sports/2014/09/23/cyclist-ian-cranes-attitude-toward-crash-recovery-refreshing/26830/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/sports/files/2014/09/ian-crane.jpg", "title": "Cyclist Ian Crane focusing on recovery, not dwelling on accident", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "Ian Crane has maintained a positive and determined outlook since crashing on the last day of the USA Pro Challenge."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde3f7\"", "article_summary": "It\u2019s an incredible sport, and the community of cycling has been absolutely incredible in supporting me through all this.\nHe\u2019s grateful to be alive, grateful for the care he received.\nAnd he\u2019s doing everything in his power to return to the sport he loves.\n\u201cI\u2019m not dwelling on the accident,\u201d Crane said.\nHe recognizes it is a long road, but he is committed to doing the best possible at his rehab training."}
