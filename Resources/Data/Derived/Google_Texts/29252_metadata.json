Pat Roberts.\n\nWolf stopped at Hughes Park, S.W. 7th and Parkview, and spent about an hour speaking with supporters.\n\n\u201cPeople are so tired of negative politics,\u201d Wolf told about 10 people who gathered in the park.\n\nHe was speaking about campaign ads from his opponent, who is seeking a fourth term in the Senate.\n\nTopeka was one of three cities Wolf visited Saturday. He spent half an hour talking with people at a doughnut shop in Newton before visiting Topeka. From 3 to 4:30 p.m., Wolf was scheduled to appear at a candidate forum in Manhattan and was slated to return to Topeka from 6 to 8 p.m. for a rally and cookout at Hughes Park.\n\nChristy Lockard, of Tecumseh, said she supports Wolf in his Senate bid.\n\n\u201cI just like Milton,\u201d Lockard said. \u201cHe stands for everything I do. He wants to make the country better. Right now, it\u2019s stagnant. We need change.\u201d\n\nA recent SurveyUSA poll shows Roberts\u2019 advantage over Wolf narrowed to 20 percentage points, down from 33 points. The margin of error was plus or minus 3.8 percent.\n\nWolf, a Leawood radiologist, has drawn criticism from Roberts for posting X-rays of dead and injured people accompanied by jokes about the images on his Facebook page. The Kansas Board of Healing Arts is investigating Wolf\u2019s display.\n\n\u201cIf I have offended anyone, I apologize,\u201d Wolf said Saturday when questioned about the posts.\n\nHe said it was something he posted a long time ago on his private Facebook page.\n\nMark Saylor, a Topeka doctor, has been campaigning for Wolf by knocking on doors and talking to friends and neighbors about his support for Wolf.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t like the permanent political class who are in Washington,\u201d Saylor said.\n\nDoctors have a crass sense of humor, Saylor said, and Wolf\u2019s posts on Facebook were made before he knew he was going to run for Senate. Wolf has apologized for the posts, and people should move on to more important issues, Saylor said.\n\nJonathan Schumm brought his 14 children to the park to meet Wolf. Wolf introduced himself to all of the kids and flipped through a book with the youngest.\n\nAlso showing support at the gathering was Rep. Josh Powell, of Topeka.\n\nAfter a short meet-and-greet, Wolf walked with supporters to a covered shelter, where he talked about Roberts\u2019 \u201cnegative\u201d campaign.\n\nRoberts executive campaign manager Leroy Towns responded Saturday via telephone, saying the \u201cnegative campaign ads were started by Wolf.\u201d\n\nTowns also said Roberts remains on top.\n\nWolf is one week into his two-and-a-half-week tour.\n\n\u201cWe have been all over the state,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have met a lot of former Pat Roberts supporters on this trip.\u201d\n\nWolf mentioned several times that Roberts has been in Washington, D.C., for 47 years.\n\n\u201cNo one should be in Washington for 47 years, especially when Washington has lost its way,\u201d he said. \u201cSomething big is happening, and the polls are showing it. He is in a free fall right now. We are surging. We have a week and a half, and we are going to win this thing.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "News, Local, Ann Marie Bush", "og": {"site_name": "CJOnline.com", "description": "U.S. Senate candidate Milton Wolf's large bus rolled into Topeka on Saturday morning as part of his \"Save the Republic\" tour.", "title": "Wolf stops in Topeka as part of bus tour", "url": "http://cjonline.com/news/2014-07-26/wolf-stops-topeka-part-bus-tour", "image": "http://cjonline.com/sites/default/files/lead_photo/wolf2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "description": "U.S. Senate candidate Milton Wolf\u2019s large bus rolled into Topeka on Saturday morning as part of his \u201cSave the Republic\u201d tour, predicting \u201cwe are going to win\u201d against his opponent, Sen.
