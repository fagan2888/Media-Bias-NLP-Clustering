Three in five women support the requirement, even if it violates the personal religious beliefs of a company\u2019s owners. Among younger women, that support skyrockets.\n\nThe Republican war on women may already be making it difficult for conservatives to win women voters in 2016. Hillary Clinton makes it impossible: a strong 68 percent of independent women say they would vote for Clinton if she runs for president, as would 35 percent of Republican women. It\u2019s no wonder Republicans are in an all-out battle to attack every single thing Hillary Clinton says and does: if she runs for president, the Republicans are screwed.\n\nOf course, they wouldn\u2019t be if there were a credible conservative woman to run against her. Let\u2019s examine the G.O.P. track record on this front. It begins and ends with Sarah Palin. Personally delightful. Politically colorful. But not exactly a credible candidate for a party needing to win credibility with women voters\u2014or anyone else for that matter.\n\nSo who else is there? Well, most often the GOP 2016 contenders mentioned are all men. But there are some women who could and should be considered. When pressed to come up with some XX- chromosome contenders, Republicans most frequently mention South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley, New Mexico Governor Susana Martinez, and New Hampshire Senator Kelly Ayotte. One could even add Oklahoma Governor Mary Fallin to the list and point out that, generally, while Republicans are struggling to find support at the national level, the party is doing fairly well in those states. And it\u2019s worth noting that four of the nation\u2019s five female governors are Republicans.\n\nAs for the governors, Haley is charismatic but seems like a long shot; even within heavily Republican South Carolina, an equal percentage of voters disapprove of Haley as approve of her. But Fallin and Martinez are both more popular (64 percent of Oklahomans think Fallin is doing a good job, and 61 percent of New Mexicans rate Martinez favorably), plus Martinez hails from a coveted swing state. And yet the 2016 attention focuses on the likes of John Kasich (Ohio), Scott Walker (Wisconsin), Rick Snyder (Michigan), and Bobby Jindal (Louisiana). Yet Kasich and Walker are both far from popular, disliked by almost as many voters as they are liked. And polls show more voters actively disapprove of Snyder and Jindal than support them. That\u2019s in their home states!\n\nWhen it comes to the Senate, Republican presidential pickers tend to focus not on Ayotte but on Ted Cruz (Texas), Marco Rubio (Florida), and Rand Paul (Kentucky). But bear this in mind: Ted Cruz won 56 percent of Texas votes in 2012, only one percentage point more than John McCain earned in the Lone Star State in the 2008 presidential election. In 2010, 56 percent of Kentucky voters backed Rand Paul, but 58 percent backed McCain in 2008. In 2010 in Florida, Marco Rubio carried 49 percent of all voters; McCain lost the state in 2012 with 48 percent of the vote. In other words, even in their home states, Cruz, Paul, and Rubio aren\u2019t uniquely, nor even widely popular; they\u2019re just Republicans\u2014faring as well as other Republican candidates.\n\nBy comparison, in 2008 Obama won 54 percent of the New Hampshire vote, and McCain got 45 percent. But in 2010, Ayotte won statewide with 60 percent support. That makes Kelly Ayotte a uniquely popular Republican with broad bi-partisan appeal, especially compared with the other guys.\n\nOf course, Jindal, Kasich, Walker, Snyder, Fallin, and Haley have all signed extremely draconian laws restricting abortions, so their appeal to moderate voters is questionable. And certainly Rubio, Paul, and Ayotte would face a significant hurdle with voters who are fed up with Republican obstructionism at the federal level and rate Republicans in Congress in general lower than dirt.\n\nIf Republicans want to have a fighting change with women voters in 2016 and with mainstream American voters in general, abandoning their extremist and extremely unpopular anti-women agenda would also help. But in the meantime, some rebranding couldn\u2019t hurt. Out with the Palin, in with the new.\n\nAyotte and Martinez, and even Haley and Fallin, have all kinds of political and demographic advantages, in addition to the obvious reality that they would stop Hillary Clinton from automatically winning the \u201cvote for the first female president\u201d vote. Ayotte and Martinez in particular should be rolling off the tongues of the Republican chattering class as they name top contenders for the presidential ticket. But they aren\u2019t.\n\nWhy is that, exactly? There couldn\u2019t possibly be sexism within the Republican Party. After all, these folks don\u2019t believe sexism exists.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Gosh, I bet Republicans are starting to regret their systematic alienation of women.", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9Net 2016", "author": "Sally Kohn", "og": {"site_name": "Vanity Fair", "description": "Gosh, I bet Republicans are starting to regret their systematic alienation of women.", "title": "The One Thing Republicans Must Do to Have a Credible Shot at Defeating Hillary", "url": "http://www.vanityfair.com/news/politics/2014/07/hillary-clinton-republican-women", "image": "http://media.vanityfair.com/photos/54cabb99a298661966eeb9de/4:3/w_1200,h_630,c_limit/image.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.vanityfair.com", "description": "Gosh, I bet Republicans are starting to regret their systematic alienation of women.", "title": "The One Thing Republicans Must Do to Have a Credible Shot at Defeating Hillary", "image": {"src": "http://media.vanityfair.com/photos/54cabb99a298661966eeb9de/master/pass/image.jpg?mbid=social_retweet"}, "site": "@VanityFair", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"admins": 7802537, "app_id": 1591153417872059, "pages": 8810407571}, "viewport": "user-scalable=no, width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "keywords": "Politics,politics splash", "pubdate": "2014-07-09T08:00:00Z"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0395\"", "article_summary": "Three in five women support the requirement, even if it violates the personal religious beliefs of a company\u2019s owners.\nThe Republican war on women may already be making it difficult for conservatives to win women voters in 2016.\nIt\u2019s no wonder Republicans are in an all-out battle to attack every single thing Hillary Clinton says and does: if she runs for president, the Republicans are screwed.\nHillary Clinton makes it impossible: a strong 68 percent of independent women say they would vote for Clinton if she runs for president, as would 35 percent of Republican women.\nIf Republicans want to have a fighting change with women voters in 2016 and with mainstream American voters in general, abandoning their extremist and extremely unpopular anti-women agenda would also help."}
