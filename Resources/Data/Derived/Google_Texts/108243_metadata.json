The list was being updated by a five-member team.\n\n\"We are checking doctors' availability hourly due to the connectivity issues. We're also adding details of doctors who've reached out and volunteered to help,\" a Practo spokesman said.\n\nOn social media, citizens used hash tags such as #ChennaiRainsHelp to share helpline numbers, offer free food and drugs and even arrange conference calls for those out of credit on their mobile phones.\n\nAmmar Kanchwala, a Hyderabad-based IT executive, said he had used his own funds to add calling credits to about 50 mobile phone users who were stranded.\n\nSriharan Balan, a 25-year-old travel consultant in Chennai, was using Facebook to reach out to those in need and supplying them with home-cooked food. \"These are all my people. Obviously, I need to help them,\" he said.\n\nThree software developers also used data from several sources to build a dynamic map that shows flooded roads in the city.( http://bit.ly/1TtRB2e\n\nWhile 18,000 people have been evacuated from rooftops and outlying villages, many remain in dire need of basic supplies.\n\nOla, India's leading online taxi firm that last week worked with fishermen and professional rowers to co-ordinate boat rescues, said it was running temporary homes that were equipped with relief supplies.\n\n(Additional reporting and writing by Aditya Kalra; Editing by Douglas Busvine and Alex Richardson)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "BENGALURU/NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Tech enthusiasts across India joined hands to help tho", "title": "Residents resort to self-help as floods grip India's Chennai", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2015/12/03/Residents-resort-self-help-floods-grip-Indias-Chennai", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/india-flood_4.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2015/12/03/Residents-resort-self-help-floods-grip-Indias-Chennai", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/india-flood_4.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "BENGALURU/NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Tech enthusiasts across India joined hands to help tho", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0ee6\"", "article_summary": "The Indian military has struggled to evacuate thousands of residents stranded in and around Chennai.\nSriharan Balan, a 25-year-old travel consultant in Chennai, was using Facebook to reach out to those in need and supplying them with home-cooked food.\nThree software developers also used data from several sources to build a dynamic map that shows flooded roads in the city.\nPracto, a company that connects patients to doctors, issued a public Google document with a list of 57 doctors available for consultation.\n( http://bit.ly/1TtRB2eWhile 18,000 people have been evacuated from rooftops and outlying villages, many remain in dire need of basic supplies."}
