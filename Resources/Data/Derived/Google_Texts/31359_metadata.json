Following the horrific attacks in Paris, those rules of engagement were altered to allow convoys carrying oil to be bombed.\n\n\u201cOil is the black gold that funds ISIS\u2019s black flag,\u201d the Financial Times observed in October. \u201c[I]t fuels its war machine.\u201d ISIS controls most oil fields in Syria, producing 34,000 to 40,000 barrels a day. It also controls oil fields in northern Iraq, producing 8,000 barrels a day. Charging between $25 and $45 a barrel, ISIS generates $1.53 million a day in oil revenues \u2014 or more than a half billion dollars annually \u2014 causing one U. S. Treasury Department official to describe it as the world\u2019s \u201cbest-funded terrorist organization.\u201d\n\nAs allied forces conducted airstrikes in Syria, two thousand miles away in Belgium, authorities were searching Molenbeek, a mostly Muslim neighborhood in Brussels. At least three of the terrorists involved in the Paris attacks were believed to have ties to Molenbeek, among them the operation\u2019s mastermind Abdelhamid Abaaoud. For decades, the neighborhood has been home to young people who have embraced radical Islam. \u201c[I]n the 1970s,\u201d The Washington Post reported, \u201cSaudi Arabia and other Persian Gulf countries sent funding for rigid religious schools [and] Whabbi mosques.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s a long history to the use of oil revenue to foster radicalization and support terrorism. More recently, while the 9/11 Commission concluded the funding source of the Sept. 11 attacks on New York City and Washington \u201cremains unknown,\u201d Osama bin Laden was a member of the uber-wealthy bin Laden family of Saudi Arabia, whose construction business is heavily financed by state oil revenue. As a result, after Sept. 11, there was a national movement in the U.S. to reduce the consumption of foreign oil. Using Middle East oil was viewed as contributing to a risk to national security.\n\nThe best way to reduce oil consumption is to replace oil with another substance. Out of that concept came the Renewable Fuel Standard. Passed by the U.S. Congress in 2005 and beefed up in 2007 to become the Energy Independence and Security Act, the bipartisan legislation required U.S. oil companies to blend biofuels \u2014 mostly ethanol \u2014 into the national transportation fuel supply. When George W. Bush signed the bill, he said the RFS would make America \u201cless dependent on foreign sources of energy.\u201d\n\nThe RFS worked so well that by 2013 the federal government reported that ethanol comprised more than 10 percent of gasoline consumed in 22 states and the District of Columbia. So it was alarming to the renewable fuel industry and national security experts when Obama, who had supported biofuels and the RFS as a U.S. senator, as a presidential candidate in 2008, and then as president, did a sudden about-face and ordered the EPA to gut the RFS.\n\nThe first indication of a change came in November 2013 when the EPA disclosed its intention to reduce biofuels mandates by 15 to 20 percent a year, starting in 2014. Going forward, the new rules could even allow oil companies to refuse to distribute mandated levels of biofuels at their gasoline stations across the country \u2014 a potential death blow to the biofuel industry.\n\nIronically, after a lengthy delay, the diminished RFS is scheduled to become law on Nov. 30, the very day Obama will be arriving in Paris to attend the U.N. Convention on Climate Change. Since he has made climate change one of his signature issues, Obama will no doubt offer a spirited argument as to why his fellow world leaders \u2014 as many as 118 of them \u2014 should endorse efforts to reduce carbon pollution, the main cause of global warming. He will likely not discuss the fact that his own administration is gutting the RFS, the one piece of legislation proven to reduce oil consumption, which is not only a principal cause of carbon pollution but also, as the terrorist attacks in Paris serves as a reminder, a matter of national security.\n\nPaul Alexander, formerly of Iowa City, is a best-selling author, a playwright and a former Time magazine writer.
