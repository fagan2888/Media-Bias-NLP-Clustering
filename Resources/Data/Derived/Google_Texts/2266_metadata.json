The National Federation of Independent Businesses (NFIB) sponsored a public forum at the Columbus Library on Macon Road featuring eight of the nine candidates running for the seat being vacated by Lynn Westmoreland next year. Six republicans and two democrats lined the stage of the auditorium, as several small business owners and other concerned voters came out to hear how the candidates could distinguish themselves.\n\nCade Joiner owns a paper-shredding business in Griffin, Ga. Small business is a top priority of his this election season.\n\n\u201cI was looking to see what this lady and these gentlemen thought about small business, what their plans were, and how they plan to help the taxation situation we\u2019re facing as small business owners,\u201d Joiner said. \u201cAnd also the burden of regulation, what they can do to relieve that of small business owners.\u201d\n\nThe candidates spoke to relieving that pressure.\n\n\u201cA one size fits all policy on regulations is just not fair to the small businesses,\u201d West Point native and Republican candidate Drew Ferguson said.\n\nGeorgia State Senator Mike Crane did not agree with the recent executive announcement to pay overtime to salaried employees making less than about $47,500.\n\n\u201cI think the federal government has gone too far involving themselves in our employment negotiations,\u201d Crane said.\n\nFellow Republican candidate and business owner Chip Flanegan echoed Crane\u2019s remarks.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s my choice,\u201d Flanegan said.\u201dI\u2019m the owner, I get to make those decisions.\u201d\n\nFederal overreach seemed to be a common theme among most of the candidates. At one point, the candidates responded to how they would work with the next president and other members of congress. Republican candidate Richard Mix looked forward to working with \u201cPresident Trump.\u201d The Sharpsburg business owner also spoke to the cuts at Fort Benning having negative effects for the future.\n\n\u201cWhen we\u2019ve seen troop deployment go up, when troop count has been cut, that\u2019s a dangerous precedent,\u201d Mix explained.\n\n\u201cEach soldier there supplies three civilian jobs,\u201d Republican candidate Rod Thomas said.\n\nDemocratic candidate Tamarkus Cook said party lines shouldn\u2019t matter. The Coweta County pastor believes relationships are ultimately what make businesses successful.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act\u2019s impact on small businesses also drew ire and concern from each candidate.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s bad business, it\u2019s bad for business, and it hasn\u2019t helped the average worker achieve a more affordable healthcare plan,\u201d Republican candidate Jim Pace said.\n\nDemocratic candidate Angela Pendley says she wants to revise \u201cObamacare\u201d and accept federal funding to expand medicare and medicaid.\n\nAt the end of the night, business owner Cade Joiner says the candidate he elects to the 3rd Congressional District of Georgia must work to simplify his struggle of dealing with compliance issues and rampant red tape at the federal level.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d rather be spending my time going out and selling to new customers and creating jobs in the community.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Candidates running for Georgia's 3rd Congressional District are making their last pitch to voters before election day.", "application-name": "WRBL", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=399055571", "og": {"site_name": "WRBL", "description": "Candidates running for Georgia\u2019s 3rd Congressional District are making their last pitch to voters before election day.", "title": "Candidates clash at 3rd Congressional District Forum", "url": "http://wrbl.com/2016/05/19/candidates-clash-at-3rd-congressional-district-forum/", "image": {"width": 660, "identifier": "https://mgtvwrbl.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/3rd_congressional_forum_candidates.jpg", "height": 371}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Candidates running for Georgia\u2019s 3rd Congressional District are making their last pitch to voters before election day.", "creator": "@wrblnews3", "image": {"src": "https://mgtvwrbl.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/3rd_congressional_forum_candidates.jpg?w=640"}, "title": "Candidates clash at 3rd Congressional District Forum", "site": "wrblnews3", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "generator": "WordPress.com", "msvalidate.01": "25404283363C09DE121A55A903F03873", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.com.mediageneral.wrbl", "fb": {"pages": 20329594375}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "google-site-verification": "xCULh1uEoIaKWWUHadKZ-hQw2CzTaDpwKQYQSYT1VCk", "keywords": "3rd congressional district, forum, columbus, muscogee, library, macon road, georgia, lynn westmoreland, election, vote, ballot, tamarkus cook, republican, democrat, jim pace, mike crane, richard mix, drew ferguson, chip flanagan, angela pendley, rod thomas", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/WRBL3", "published_time": "2016-05-19T04:06:58+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-05-19T19:22:03+00:00"}, "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://wrbl.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/f2d00a10a5f1f1038952e3043b8312b5?s=16"}, "article_summary": "COLUMBUS, Ga. \u2013 Candidates running for Georgia\u2019s 3rd Congressional District are making their last pitch to voters before election day.\nCandidates running for Georgia's 3rd Congressional District are making their last pitch to voters before election day.\nCade Joiner owns a paper-shredding business in Griffin, Ga.
