He also discussed the ways in which church bylaws should be amended for greater legal protection in case of litigation.\n\n\u201cReligious freedom has never been more threatened in U.S. history,\u201d he claimed, and said that in all settings -- schools, families, businesses, and churches -- there is an uncertainty as to how legal issues will pan out.\n\nDacus says that the first line of defense are the Christian colleges that could potentially lose their tax exempt status, for being considered as discriminatory against LGBT students, similar to the way Bob Jones University lost its tax-exempt status for banning interracial marriages in 1983. Churches could also lose their tax-exempt status, but that would likely not happen until Christian institutions\u2019 tax-exempt statuses are taken away first, \u201cfor political reasons,\u201d Dacus added.\n\nFamilies may also be impacted by the ruling as well, Dacus said, in that a parent\u2019s failure to embrace the child\u2019s sexuality can be considered \u2018negligence,\u2019 resulting in the parent\u2019s loss of custody over the child.\n\n\u201cIf CPS (Child Protective Services) social workers try to take your children, please, please don\u2019t hesitate to contact us,\u201d Dacus said. \u201cWe will protect your children from being taken.\u201d\n\nThe ruling will also affect what is taught in public schools, he continued. Teachers who favor same-sex marriages are now \u201cempowered to promote same-sex marriage,\u201d and the social studies curriculum in public schools will likely include lessons on the contributions made by LGBT individuals. Dacus encouraged parents who are concerned about this to sign opt-out forms which would allow their children to be excused from sitting in during such lesson plans.\n\nDacus also discussed the ways businesses have been impacted. On the one hand, he mentioned the cases of a flower shop, a bakery, and a photographer refusing service to same-sex weddings, and that all of these businesses have lost their cases.\n\nOn the other hand, there are also Christian businesses that have won lawsuits, including a Christian T-shirt business in Kentucky that refused to print gay pride festival shirts that was vindicated by the court. The court ruled that the law protects the company\u2019s decision not to print shirts with speech that contradicts the company\u2019s beliefs, under the First Amendment.\n\nHobby Lobby is another Christian business that won a lawsuit. It challenged the contraceptive coverage requirement under the Affordable Care Act, claiming that the requirement went against their Christian principles. Dacus explained some of the major factors that led to Hobby Lobby\u2019s victory was that it was a closely held business, and that they had protection under the federal Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA). Though a similar result could apply to other closely held businesses, Dacus said, results could also differ depending on the state by state statutes on religious freedom.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know how [future cases will] to pan out,\u201d Dacus said. \u201cThat\u2019s why we have to be cautious.\u201d\n\nA similar uncertainty applies for churches and pastors, Dacus said. However, Dacus urged church leaders to adjust their policies and bylaws. He says that changes in the church\u2019s bylaws \u201cwill, for the time being at least, protect your churches.\u201d\n\nIn the revised version of their bylaws, churches should explicitly state their doctrine on marriage and sexuality. Bylaws should also include policies regarding the use of facilities and even church membership. PJI provides an outline on its website (pacificjustice.org) on how churches should revise their bylaws. Such revisions in church policies and bylaws will offer a stronger basis for protection under the First Amendment and a stronger likelihood for a church or pastor to win a lawsuit, in the case that a church and/or pastor face litigation and claims of discrimination.\n\nPJI, which was founded in 1997, consists of hundreds of volunteer affiliate attorneys across the nation, and offers pro-bono services for churches, pastors, and lay members facing legal issues regarding their religious freedom.
