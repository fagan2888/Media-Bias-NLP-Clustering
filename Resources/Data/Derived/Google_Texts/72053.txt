After one of the hottest days all summer on Wednesday– with a scorching 93 degrees– we’re cooling things off with big changes ahead. The ridge of high pressure keeps us nice and dry for Friday and Saturday– as morning clouds burn off for nice afternoon sunshine and temps near 80 degrees. That’s much warmer still than the normal of 72 for this part of late summer.

A system of low pressure called a cut-off low is heading our way and should be here by Sunday. It’s riding on the fast moving jet stream– but it will bring clouds, cooler temperatures and a chance of Sunday showers as well as some possible Cascade thunderstorms. The timing on the showers looks to be later in the day on Sunday.

A front right behind it looks to drop our temperatures even further– to highs in the mid 60s. Those are temperatures we were seeing as morning lows last week! Showers look likely for Monday and Tuesday morning. A brief break Wednesday and the forecast models look in pretty good agreement that we’ll see some rain back on Thursday. This weekend is the last full one of the official summer season– so hopefully you can get out and enjoy the Saturday sunshine at least. Sunday, ignore the clouds and focus on rooting on the Seahawks!
