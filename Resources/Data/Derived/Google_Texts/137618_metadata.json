Everyone complains about it, but sometimes it seems that no one can do anything about it.\n\nAn international company I advised was plagued by 800 regularly scheduled meetings on the management calendar, a function of a matrixed organization with hundreds of committees and task forces whose members had to be involved, whether in person or by video conference. The company wanted help. So I was asked to talk with\u2014you\u2019re expecting this, right?\u2014the committee on meetings.\n\nMeeting-averse smaller companies can operate by the bump-into method, in which spontaneous encounters in central open areas sometimes substitute for formal communications, but that doesn\u2019t work for everyone. Meetings are a fact of organizational life, so we\u2019d better make them more productive. Some of the keys involve not the meetings themselves but the company culture surrounding them.\n\n\u2013 Start with a strong culture in which everyone understands the company\u2019s purpose and values, which creates a foundation for trust. Trust means that people don\u2019t feel the need to meet about absolutely everything. People can act in their areas of accountability.\n\n\u2013 Begin meetings with affirming the larger mission, purpose and values. That saves participants from being bogged down in trivialities or petty disagreements.\n\n\u2013 Set norms about meeting discipline. Start on time, end on time. Only those invited can attend. If some send their assistants, soon everyone does, and no one in the meeting can actually do anything.\n\n\u2013 Use data and dashboards. Provide access to common indicators that alert everyone to situations, encouraging action without calling a meeting. Do reporting in advance by circulating materials. Minimize reporting on the spot, using meeting time for open questions. Advance materials are also a way to manage egos; if people are named and feels represented, they don\u2019t feel the same need to hog airtime just to show their relevance.\n\n\u2013 End with action commitments. Don\u2019t let people leave without next steps, or the only step will be another unproductive meeting.\n\nTo avoid getting camels\u2014horses designed by a committee\u2014use subgroups, and let them work it out in advance of formal meetings. Justice Stephen Breyer has described the Supreme Court process, which facilitates dialogue among dissenting voices.\n\nGordon Bethune\u2019s very successful turnaround of legacy Continental Airlines utilized many of these elements. Higher performance was helped by a common definition of success (on-time arrivals) with something in it for every constituency, coupled with a set of performance indicators. A daily cross-functional operations meeting of 15 minutes every morning went with lightning speed through the issues because data were available in advance, and trust was nurtured. Often problems revealed by the data tackled in self-organized conversations even earlier in the morning, and solved before the meeting began.\n\nRosabeth Moss Kanter (@RosabethKanter) holds the Ernest L.
