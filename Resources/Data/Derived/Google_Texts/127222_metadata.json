Within a matter of minutes on Google, you would have a pretty good idea of the price range for the product you want.\n\nBut in health care? Forget it.\n\nShining light on a system where the costs of the same procedure might range from $0 to $1,100. That\u2019s just one example.\n\nIt\u2019s well known to health policy types, but less so to consumers, that health care prices are utterly lacking in transparency and wildly variable.\n\nIf you\u2019ve ever looked at a bill for a health care procedure \u2014 and been astounded by the numbers you see \u2014 or thought that you would like to find the best price on an elective procedure \u2014 and been astounded that there\u2019s no easy way to compare prices \u2014 KQED is launching a new project for you.\n\nToday we bring you \u201cPrice Check,\u201d a community-created guide to health costs. Since no database yet exists where consumers can easily look up costs, we\u2019re commencing the work of creating one. But we need your help.\n\nThis summer and into the fall, we\u2019re turning to you, our community, to share \u2014 anonymously \u2014 what you have paid for some common procedures. We\u2019re starting with mammograms. (More on \u201cwhy mammograms?\u201d in a moment.)\n\nWe\u2019ve created a tool to make it easy to share what you paid. Visit the tool and take a look. If you don\u2019t have insurance and pay out of pocket \u2014 called self-pay \u2014 you can enter that price. If you have insurance, you can submit both what your health insurance paid and your own co-pay charge, if any.\n\nOnce you\u2019ve shared your costs, the tool will feed your information into a database so you can see how much mammograms cost elsewhere in the Bay Area and across California. Again, your submitted data are anonymous and confidential.\n\nWe want this project to have as much impact as possible, so we have teamed up with KPCC, our public radio friends in Southern California, and ClearHealthCosts.com, a New York City startup working to bring transparency to the health care marketplace.\n\nWe chose to start with mammograms, because it is a screening test that many women have at least every other year. Because it is a test that can be scheduled, women could, in theory, shop around for the best price. Yes, mammograms are covered as a preventive benefit under the Affordable Care Act, and patients are supposed to access them at no co-pay, but that doesn\u2019t always happen.\n\nLearn more: read all our PriceCheck coverage.\n\nClearHealthCosts did a pilot version of this project with WNYC public radio in New York in 2012. They found that 25-30 percent of the 400 respondents were paying for their mammograms. That\u2019s because some of the women chose out-of-network providers, or they weren\u2019t insured, or the mammogram simply wasn\u2019t covered.\n\nWe\u2019ll be able to compare California data with what ClearHealthCosts learned with WNYC \u2014 where women paid between $0 and $1,100 or more.\n\nIn other sectors of the economy, people often equate higher cost with higher quality, but in health care there\u2019s not a correlation between price and quality. We think people want quality care at a fair price. But just as there is little transparency in health costs, there are few good measures of quality. We believe that shining a bright light on health costs helps to drive discussion about quality metrics.\n\nWe\u2019re just at the start of this project. Over the next four months, we\u2019ll sample other common procedures. We\u2019re grateful to the Knight Foundation for funding this project through a Prototype Fund grant.\n\nPlease join us! We\u2019ll report what you share with us as soon as we have stories to tell.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Health care prices are utterly lacking in transparency and wildly variable.
