Marco Rubio continues his media blitz while promoting his new book, featuring an appearance on the Daily Show last night with Jon Stewart.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nFor a Republican, it\u2019s an important test. Can you face an aggressive liberal host with an audience giving him the upper hand in an argument? Some Republicans succeed but others struggle.\n\nRubio arguably performed well on the show, earning some respect from the audience, and finished by earning some begrudging admiration from Stewart.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re a Democrat. In your heart you\u2019re a Democrat,\u201d Stewart insisted after a discussion about government and conservatism. \u201cYou care about the things that have happened to you \u2026 so you have empathy and you understand it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think you misunderstand conservatism,\u201d Rubio replied, arguing that conservatives care about people and want them to succeed.\n\nRubio also managed to earn respect from the audience with self deprecation, joking that his book cover was photoshopped and bantering with Stewart\u2019s jokes about Florida.\n\nAt one point, Rubio earned chuckles from the audience with a joke, causing Stewart to react in mock horror.\n\n\u201cShun him!!\u201d he yelled at the audience.\n\nAs Stewart confronted him with a defense of government, Rubio successfully defended Republican skepticism about the system. Government had a role to play, Rubio argued, but crony capitalism had given big companies an unfair advantage.\n\nAt one point, Rubio referred to \u201cObamacare,\u201d prompting Stewart to clarify that Obama\u2019s health care bill was called the \u201cAffordable Care Act.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn Florida we call it Obamacare,\u201d Rubio quipped in response, pointing out that it was actually a bailout for insurance companies.\n\n\u201cListen, I agree with you on that, it\u2019s certainly a boon for the insurance industry, no question about that, I think you\u2019re right.\u201d Stewart admitted.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Sen.
