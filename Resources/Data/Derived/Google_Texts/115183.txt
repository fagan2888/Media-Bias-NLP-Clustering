Jim Zeigler has been a colorful fixture around Alabama's political scene for decades. Nowhere is that more obvious than on his website, www.zeiglerstory.com, and his Facebook page.

The Republican nominee for state auditor's website appears to be a copy of a Wikipedia page but a little exploration reveals the user-contributed encyclopedia site deleted Zeigler's actual bio page in May, saying "it seems to be nothing more than a promotional page."

On Facebook, Zeigler - a former Public Service Commissioner who made unsuccessful attempts for the state supreme court, state treasurer, civil appeals court, and state auditor - covers such topics as football, terrorism, breakfast and prayer. Here are a few of his more quotable quotes:

"It's the 40th anniversary of the state song "Sweet Home Alabama." I will use this at my inauguration if you elect me State Auditor..."In Birmingham they love the Auditor."

"I woke in the night and had composed a song in my dreams. I am not 100 percent sure it is original. Is this an original work of art, or have I just forgotten hearing it?

I fought the Lord and the --- Lord won.

I fought the Lord and the -- Lord won.

Who should I dedicate this song to? The Islamic Terrorists? Who?"

"Game of the year. Bama v. Texas A&M Oct. 18 in Tuscaloosa. #1 Alabama v. #2 Texas A&M. Mark it down now."

"How about this Saturday breakfast from all leftovers at the Zeigler estate? Gulf Shrimp brown-egg omelet with Belle Chevre goat cheese from Elkmont, Alabama. Rib-eye steak from Moseley's. Hashbrowns of Baldwin County sweet potatoes. Red Diamond Coffee. If I am going to be a fat-cat Republican, I want to eat like one."

"ISIS terrorists waited until Bama game kicked off and then beheaded another. British this time."

"Old fashion Southern breakfast. They don't call this Coffee County for nothing."

(On the Monte Sano Arts Festival) "I got to play a guitar made from pinewood and a cigar box. I played "Just a Bowl of Butterbeans." I have had several requests about playing, but I played anyway."

It's another Monday and it's sure to be a busy week in Alabama politics. Let's catch up on the weekend's news:
