Mr. Maverick made his long-awaited announcement official last night; he\u2019s going to run for re-election next year (via NBC News):\n\n\u201cI have decided to run for re-election,\u201d the Arizona senator told NBC News in an exclusive interview revealing his plans to pursue a sixth term on Capitol Hill. \u201cI\u2019m ready. I am more than ready. In some ways, I am eager.\u201d McCain is currently 78 years old but will be 80 by Election Day in 2016. He defended his vitality, saying that he is \u201cjust getting started\u201d when it comes to his Senate career. \u201cI say watch me,\u201d he said. \u201cTake a look. Take a look at my 18 hour days. Take a look at the hearings we have. Take a look at my legislative accomplishments.\u201d \u2026 McCain finally landed a dream job this year as chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee. From that perch, he can continue the committee\u2019s long tradition of bipartisanship. But the post also gives McCain an even bigger megaphone on national security, which he uses often to criticize President Barack Obama. \u201cI have never been more concerned about the security of this nation because of the feckless leadership of the president of the United States,\u201d he said. After winning the Republican Party\u2019s nomination for president in 2008, McCain has faced anger from conservatives who saw him as too moderate. Tea Party groups see him as a top target for a primary challenge. Last year, Arizona\u2019s state Republican Party censured McCain as too liberal, but today he says his home state relationships \u201chave improved significantly.\u201d \u2026 To win his own re-election, McCain said he will stress home state issues, including Arizona\u2019s drought, his work to benefit a local copper mine and his bipartisan legislation to reform the Department of Veterans Affairs after scandal at Phoenix VA Medical Center.\n\nMcCain survived a primary challenge from former Congressman J.D. Hayworth in 2010. He went on to win the general election handily over Democrat Rodney Glassman, with nearly 59 percent of the vote. Next year will be no different; conservatives have been looking for someone to boot Mr. McCain. Some were even thinking about reaching out to Sarah Palin, which the incumbent Republican laughed off.\n\n\u201cSarah and I have maintained a very close and warm relationship. That\u2019s just not in the realm of possibility,\u201d he told the Arizona Republic. Yet, the publication also mentioned State Sen. Kelli Ward, who said she\u2019s giving serious consideration to a 2016 primary challenge to Mr. McCain:\n\n\u201cI have been approached by many Arizonans who have asked me to throw my hat into the ring and run for the US Senate. People have come to know me by my principled conservative voting record and my interactive communication style which leads them to trust that I would continue to represent Arizona well, regardless of the office. I am listening and speaking with people, and a US Senate race is something under active consideration.\u201d\n\nObama\u2019s recent immigration initiatives have given what\u2019s left of the Tea Party movement a shot of adrenaline, according to the New York Times. McCain\u2019s support for comprehensive immigration reform is still seen as toxic:\n\nConservatives say emotions over immigration run so high that the issue could be even more politically potent than the Affordable Care Act. Like many of the economic concerns that animated Tea Party supporters, immigration issues play to people\u2019s anxieties about their financial well-being and the future. Many conservatives who have long mistrusted Mr. Obama because they think his policies will fundamentally alter America believe that his new immigration order will do just that, with millions of potential new foreign-born citizens even though the president\u2019s action does not call for a path to citizenship. The conundrum for the Republican Party is how to channel that energy. Turned against liberalism, as it was in the 2010 elections that ousted Democrats from power in the House of Representatives, it can deliver serious political advantage. But turned inward, as it so often has been over the last four years, it threatens to tear the party apart. In Virginia, Mr. Cantor\u2019s ouster so emboldened activists that they have started using \u201cto Cantor\u201d as a shorthand for defeating establishment Republicans.\n\nLast July, McCain said that the Republican Party can defeat Hillary in 2016, but that will only happen if they pass immigration reform (via Time):\n\nArizona Sen. John McCain said Thursday that he believes Republicans can defeat former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in 2016, but only if they pass immigration reform. \u2026 Passing immigration reform was the sole policy recommendation of the 2013 Republican Party autopsy into its 2012 rout, but the House Republican conference has repeatedly blocked any action on the measure since the Senate passed a reform bill last year. \u201cHopefully my colleagues in the House will realize the same demographics that I am referring to and that they will at least in some way bring up immigration reform, whether it\u2019s piecemeal, whether it\u2019s one-at-a-time,\u201d he said. \u201cI think as the 2016 campaign gets closer that my colleagues will recognize \u2026 that we are marginalizing the Republican Party,\u201d McCain added.\n\nAgain, as I wrote over at Townhall, Republicans should try and gobble as many Hispanic voters as they can in 2016. But, this it really isn\u2019t a doom and gloom scenario if we don\u2019t have a huge surge in Hispanic voters. We can still win without a massive boost in Hispanic support; it\u2019s just a much harder road to the White House. As Nate Cohn wrote, the lion share of Hispanic voters live in states that aren\u2019t competitive in national elections. Texas isn\u2019t going blue; Wendy Davis set the clock back on that Democratic initiative even further. And California isn\u2019t going red. That leaves the swing state of Florida, which Obama won by a slim margin in 2012. Admittedly, Republicans need to win Florida next year in order to win the election.\n\nNow, Rubio\u2019s soon-to-be official pollster said we need at least 40 percent of the Hispanic vote to win in 2016. Romney got 39 percent of the Hispanic vote in Florida, and lost the state by 0.9 percent. So, a slightly better performance with Hispanic and white voters can make up that deficit, right?\n\nThe one thing that is omitted from these demographic-national election discussions is that the electorate\u2013on average\u2013is still 75 percent white. Minor shifts in that massive voting bloc has a huge impact in national elections, even more than that from Hispanic voters\u2013who were only 10 percent of the electorate in 2012.\n\nIn a 2013 panel at the Brookings Institute, Sean Trende of Real Clear Politics said that Republicans could\u2019ve clinched the majority of the popular vote, and possibly the presidency, if they got 21 percent more Hispanic voters, 16 percent more Black voters, or 3 percent more white voters. He also mentioned that fewer whites voted in 2012 (72 percent) than in 2004 (77 percent). Why? Trende added that the areas where white turnout was down\u2013a huge cluster of counties stretching from upstate New York to New Mexico\u2013was where Ross Perot\u2019s message of economic populism resonated when he ran for president in the 1990s. They stayed home because Obama was too liberal, and Mitt Romney was just too unrelatable. Nevertheless, white working class whites have been flocking to the GOP, and it\u2019s a huge obstacle for Democrats in their campaign to retake the House, Senate, and the White House in the future. So, it\u2019s not a \u201cdo or die\u201d situation if Republicans don\u2019t pass immigration reform.\n\nNevertheless, McCain should watch out for Rep. Krysten Sinema (D-AZ), who Politico noted cruised to re-election, despite a Republican wave last year. Also, she\u2019s drifted toward the center, with the Times reporting that her party line votes have decreased, dropping \u201cto 73 percent from 80 percent this year.\u201d Yet, if Sinema decides not to run, Democrats pretty much have no one for 2016, but McCain will have to survive an expected primary challenge before he can start relaxing somewhat. For starters, he doesn\u2019t have as much cash to spend to fend off a more right-leaning candidate this year:\n\nif Sinema bows out, Democrats\u2019 top tier includes Mark Kelly, the astronaut and husband of former Rep. Gabby Giffords; Richard Carmona, the former surgeon general who lost a Senate bid to Jeff Flake in 2012; and former Gov. Janet Napolitano, if she could be lured away from the president of the University of California. Democrats see all three as extremely unlikely to run. The next rung of potential candidates includes Phoenix Mayor Greg Stanton, Rep. Ann Kirkpatrick and Rep.-elect Ruben Gallego. Wildcard: McCain\u2019s cash. In 2010, McCain fended off a primary challenge by dumping $20 million into the race to batter his opponent, former Rep. J.D. Hayworth. Much of that cash was left over from his presidential bid and won\u2019t be at his disposal when his number is called in 2016. That could lead to more parity on the airwaves, especially if a challenger wins help from conservative groups wary of McCain.\n\nWell, here we go.\n\n**This post has been updated to clarify Rep. Sinema\u2019s voting record with her party. Oh, and Texas certainly isn\u2019t going blue.\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "The day has arrived. .", "title": "I\u2019m running again in 2016, my friends", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2015/04/07/im-running-again-in-2016-my-friends/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary", "creator": "@JazzShaw"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "article": {"published_time": "2015-04-07T12:41:02+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-04-07T19:28:24+00:00"}, "keywords": "Arizona, immigration, primary, Republicans, Tea Party,", "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd38f4\"", "article_summary": "\u201cI think as the 2016 campaign gets closer that my colleagues will recognize \u2026 that we are marginalizing the Republican Party,\u201d McCain added.\nI\u2019m running again in 2016, my friendsposted at 8:41 am on April 7, 2015 by Matt VespaYes, the entire conservative wing of the Republican Party just made a huge eyeroll.\nBut, this it really isn\u2019t a doom and gloom scenario if we don\u2019t have a huge surge in Hispanic voters.\nAs Nate Cohn wrote, the lion share of Hispanic voters live in states that aren\u2019t competitive in national elections.\nAgain, as I wrote over at Townhall, Republicans should try and gobble as many Hispanic voters as they can in 2016."}
