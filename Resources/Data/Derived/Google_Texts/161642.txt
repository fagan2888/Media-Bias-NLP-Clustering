Powerful social forces will drive the healthcare industry to innovate, overcoming institutional and political inertia, says healthcare consultant and futurist Ian Morrison. But things may not get 'serious' until 2018.

Morrison served up the opening keynote at the National Healthcare Innovation Summit on May 14 in Boston, delivering a somber message concerning the urgent need for innovation in healthcare. The two-day summit, organized by the Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society, is focused on how to spur and sustain innovation.

Morrison told the innovation summit audience that in the short term, there would be lots of agitation and planning. There are two competing visions for the U.S. healthcare system, he said: The Berwickinian Nirvana (named for Donald Berwick, former CMS Administrator) of the large ACOs that encourage rationalization of the delivery system and the atomistic view of a consumer armed only with high deductible health plans that will impose market discipline on providers."

"Those two visions need to be reconciled," he said.

There is so much work left to do that requires innovation. Morrison rattled off a few: clinical integration, health IT as platform, learning to live on Medicare, managing business model migration, building a culture of quality and accountability.

"We have the anatomy of an accountable care organization but none of the physiology," he commented.

"When you get in the Triple Aim work, you have to think in different kinds of innovations," Morrison said. "You have to open your mind. You've got to get serious. I don't think we're going back to the 1970s. The purchasers have had it; theyâ€™re not going to take it anymore."

Some of what he's observed about the U.S. healthcare system as he's traveled around the country include:
