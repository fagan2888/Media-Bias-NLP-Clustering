Danny Damiani/USA TODAY NETWORK-Wisconsin (Photo: Danny Damiani/USA TODAY NETWORK-Wisconsin)Buy Photo\n\nEDITOR: The USA TODAY NETWORK-Wisconsin editorial pages have included several opinion pieces over the past weeks about the Supreme Court race, which Wisconsin voters will decide on April 5.\n\nI write in support of Judge JoAnne Kloppenburg. Judge Kloppenburg has superb legal and judicial qualifications, including her current service as the presiding judge on the Wisconsin Court of Appeals, District 4. Before being elected to the Court in 2012, she represented the people of Wisconsin as an assistant attorney general at the Wisconsin Department of Justice. Her broad legal experience included handling complex cases in constitutional and environmental law as well as supervising attorneys in criminal matters.\n\nAs impressive as her qualifications are, it is her strong commitment to a non-partisan judiciary that spurred me to make a public endorsement. Judge Kloppenburg shares my staunch allegiance to courts free of partisan politics, where everyone gets a fair shake. I urge your readers to learn about Judge Kloppenburg. I think when they do they will see that her intelligence, integrity, independence and experience are qualities that make her a good choice to serve all the people of Wisconsin on the Wisconsin Supreme Court\n\nAnn Walsh Bradley is a justice on the Wisconsin Supreme Court.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://wrtnews.co/1MHqcLg", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Justice Ann Walsh Bradley endorses JoAnne Kloppenburg for Wisconsin Supreme Court.", "og": {"site_name": "Daily Tribune Media", "description": "Justice Ann Walsh Bradley endorses JoAnne Kloppenburg for Wisconsin Supreme Court.", "title": "Kloppenburg committed to non-partisan judiciary", "url": "http://www.wisconsinrapidstribune.com/story/opinion/readers/2016/04/01/kloppenburg-committed-non-partisan-judiciary/82515284/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/wisconsinrapidstribune.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Justice Ann Walsh Bradley endorses JoAnne Kloppenburg for Wisconsin Supreme Court.", "title": "Kloppenburg committed to non-partisan judiciary", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/59cff5bac8de7f040b55aeb6dadb1fe8916ec27c/c=0-0-3246-3246&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2016/03/28/WIGroup/Appleton/635947850313700611-APC-KloppenburgMUG-032816-dtd8.JPG", "creator": "@wrtribune", "site": "@wrtribune", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=885558265", "fb": {"app_id": 132335483492709}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": "wisconsin, supreme court, joanne kloppenburg, Rebecca bradley"}, "article_summary": "Judge Kloppenburg shares my staunch allegiance to courts free of partisan politics, where everyone gets a fair shake.\nJudge Kloppenburg has superb legal and judicial qualifications, including her current service as the presiding judge on the Wisconsin Court of Appeals, District 4.\nI urge your readers to learn about Judge Kloppenburg.\nAs impressive as her qualifications are, it is her strong commitment to a non-partisan judiciary that spurred me to make a public endorsement.\nI write in support of Judge JoAnne Kloppenburg."}
