While employers continue to search for \u201canything they possibly can\u201d to contain rising costs, they are not shifting the financial burden for health coverage onto workers as fast or as hard as they once did through higher co-pays and having employees pay a larger percentage of the premiums.\n\nMore employers now are looking for different solutions to high costs such as wellness or moving to high-deductible plans with an HSA or HRA attached to a contribution from the company, she said.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t want to push too much on to the employees. If they can change any other features of the plan, then they can save costs without having to push costs to the employees,\u201d McPhee said. \u201cThey look at it as, \u2018What can I afford? What did I do last year and what can I do this year to keep this the same as much as possible and still afford it?\u2019\u201d\n\nSome of that thinking stems from a tightening labor market, she said.\n\nAs employers have a harder time finding skilled or qualified workers, they become more hesitant to make major changes in their health plans through cost-shifting.\n\n\u201cRight now, attraction and retention is huge in the workplace,\u201d McPhee said. \u201cNobody can find anybody.\u201d\n\nMany employers generally reported year-to-year premium increases of 3 percent to 5 percent from 2014 to 2015, although some individual employers experienced higher changes \u2014 in some instances much higher \u2014 depending on the composition of their workforce and their benefits package.\n\nThe average annual premium paid this year by the 178 survey respondents for a family health plan in West Michigan is $13,776. The average reported annual premium for a one-person health plan is $5,004.\n\nAverage premiums are across all product lines \u2014 HMO, PPO and point-of-service plans \u2014 and reflect the costs of policies after employers alter benefits to mitigate cost increases.\n\nThe moderation of annual rate adjustments the last few years could change in 2016 as a grandfathered clause expires for health plans with benefit packages that do not comply with the Affordable Care Act. That will force those employers to move to ACA-compliant plans that meet federal coverage and affordability mandates and follow different underwriting methods that are used to set rates.\n\n\u201cNext year, things are going to start to get crazy\u201d for employers with grandfathered health plans, McPhee said.\n\n\n\nLOWER RATES AHEAD?\n\nSmall employers using Priority Health or Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan can, on average, expect small premium decreases for 2016.\n\nBased on claims trends, Blue Cross Blue Shield in the spring projected a 2.2-percent average rate decrease for clients statewide, and an average of 4.8 percent for Blue Care Network policies. West Michigan small businesses could see premium decreases of 1.35 percent for Blues policies and 3.95 percent for Blue Care Network in 2016.\n\nActual premium adjustments will vary based on an employer\u2019s benefits package and where they are located in the state. Averages also are calculated prior to employers making any changes in their benefits packages when they renew policies.\n\nPriority Health plans to implement an average rate decrease in the small group market of 2.1 percent for HMO policies and 8.3 percent for PPO products, said Chief Marketing Officer Joan Budden.\n\nNationally, the National Business Group on Health this month reported that large-employer members project average rate increases of 6 percent for 2016 policy renewals before making any benefits changes, and 5 percent after changes.\n\nAmong the employers Mick Young works with in the region, one-third generally saw premium increases of 8 percent or more this year. A third had premium increases of 4 percent to 8 percent, and the remaining third had changes of 4 percent or less.\n\nYoung, a principal and business leader for benefits firm Mercer in Grand Rapids, doubts whether the rate moderation of the last few years can continue much longer. While changes in claims trends and benefits designs have affected premiums, costs continue to rise at care providers.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing that\u2019s changed in our system of delivery,\u201d Young said. \u201cI see us having to pay the piper for the moderation of the last four to five years.\u201d\n\n\n\nGROWTH IN WELLNESS\n\nElsewhere in The Employers\u2019 Association survey, wellness remains a steady growth area with 42 percent of respondents saying they now offer some form of a workplace wellness program, versus 33 percent in 2010. Employers for years have been showing an increased willingness to invest in wellness to improve the health and productivity of workers and curtail rising medical claims.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019d rather pay to keep people healthy overall. That\u2019s certainly more cost-effective,\u201d McPhee said.\n\nHealth plans over the years have been offering more products for wellness. One of the latest entries is Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan\u2019s introduction this fall of an online wellness platform from WebMD Health Services for clients who want to start a wellness program.\n\nThe WebMD service offers online employee health-risk assessments, plus health coaching and information accessed via a mobile app or website. Blue Cross Blue Shield made the service available at no cost to clients of all sizes, although it may prove most beneficial to small and mid-sized businesses that typically lack the administrative staff needed to run a wellness program.\n\nThe service is designed for easy adoption by small and mid-sized employers that have wanted to move into wellness benefits but don\u2019t have the structure to manage it.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a product that they just implement into their employee base and it just runs itself,\u201d said Cindy Bjorkquist, director of health and wellness programs at Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan. \u201cIt was designed to help that small and middle group have this off-the-shelf product that you can implement right away and just go with it.\u201d\n\n\n\nPUSH FOR HIGHER DEDUCTIBLES\n\nThe Employers\u2019 Association\u2019s 2015 survey results also indicate continued movement toward high-deductible health plans as a long-term cost-saving strategy.\n\nAgents say transitioning to a high-deductible plan can over time affect claims as employees make better decisions about how and when they access the system, largely because they are paying more out-of-pocket costs for their care.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a change in utilization. The likelihood of going to get those services is diminished to some degree,\u201d said Greg Kuhn, a senior health care adviser with the Grand Rapids office of benefits firm Mercer. \u201cPeople choose a little wiser as to what services they see and what services they go for.\u201d\n\nAs a result, employers with high-deductible plans tend to experience a lower medical claims trend by two to three percentage points, potentially, although \u201cevery case is different and based on its demographics and the plan\u2019s experience,\u201d Young said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to generalize.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Employers in West Michigan generally held firm this year in the health coverage they offer employees, incorporating only \u201cmild\u201d changes in...", "generator": "runengine.com", "rights": "www.MiBiz.com", "og": {"url": "https://mibiz.com/item/22877-hold-steady-employers-hold-off-on-drastic-changes-to-benefits-as-they-look-to-cut-costs", "image": "http://mibiz.com/media/k2/items/cache/917b2b1694191b5ac0d6ca8bab732af0_XL.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Employers in West Michigan generally held firm this year in the health coverage they offer employees, incorporating only \u201cmild\u201d changes in...", "title": "HOLD STEADY: Employers hold off on drastic changes to benefits as they look to cut costs"}, "image": "https://mibiz.com/media/k2/items/cache/917b2b1694191b5ac0d6ca8bab732af0_S.jpg", "title": "HOLD STEADY: Employers hold off on drastic changes to benefits as they look to cut costs", "author": "Mark Sanchez", "keywords": "The Employers\u2019 Association,Maggie McPhee,Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan,Priority Health,Joan Budden,National Business Group on Health,Mick Young,Mercer,health benefits,health insurance,Cindy Bjorkquist,Greg Kuhn", "original-source": "https://mibiz.com/item/22877-hold-steady-employers-hold-off-on-drastic-changes-to-benefits-as-they-look-to-cut-costs"}, "article_summary": "Actual premium adjustments will vary based on an employer\u2019s benefits package and where they are located in the state.\n\u201cNext year, things are going to start to get crazy\u201d for employers with grandfathered health plans, McPhee said.\nAs employers have a harder time finding skilled or qualified workers, they become more hesitant to make major changes in their health plans through cost-shifting.\nAverages also are calculated prior to employers making any changes in their benefits packages when they renew policies.\nWhile changes in claims trends and benefits designs have affected premiums, costs continue to rise at care providers."}
