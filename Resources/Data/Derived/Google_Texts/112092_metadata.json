The final rules affirm the $44 fee for the second year.\n\nHHS has not proposed the amount of the fee for the third and last year of the program.\n\nHHS also finalized that the fee will be paid in two installments. For example, of the first year's $63 fee, employers would make a payment of $52.50 per participant by Jan. 15, 2015, and an additional payment of $10.50 during the fourth quarter of 2015.\n\n\u201cWe recognize that the reinsurance collections provided for in the Affordable Care Act will result in substantial upfront payments from contributing entities for the reinsurance program. Therefore, in consideration of the comments received, we are finalizing our proposal to collect contributions via two payments,\u201d the final rules said.\n\nLike the earlier proposed rules, the final rules will exempt \u2014 for 2015 and 2016 only \u2014 self-insured and self-administered plans from the fees. HHS said its reading of the law is that such plans \u201cshould not be a contributing entity,\u201d adding that few plans will qualify for the exemption.\n\n%%BREAK%%\n\n\u201cVery few plans are self-administered,\u201d said Amy Bergner, managing director of human resources solutions at Pricewaterhouse-Coopers L.L.P. in Washington.\n\nStill, that exemption means that other plan sponsors will have to pay more than they otherwise would in order to raise the mandated $25 billion, said Rich Stover, a principal with Buck Consultants L.L.C. in Secaucus, N.J.\n\nThe fee has drawn fire from some members of Congress who have introduced bills to repeal it. Rep. Pat Tiberi, R-Ohio, who has introduced a repeal bill, earlier said \u201cit is simply outrageous that employers will be forced to pay the tax while they will get nothing in return.\u201d\n\nBut the likelihood of a repeal winning approval is low, observers say. A repeal \u201cwould mean that a significant amount of money would have to be raised elsewhere,\u201d said Gretchen Young, senior vice president of health policy with the ERISA Industry Committee in Washington.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Business Insurance", "description": "Employers will be allowed to pay a controversial health care reform law fee in two installments and have certainty on the amount of the fee during the second year of the three-year program under final rules issued Wednesday by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.Authorized by the...", "title": "Final HHS rules set PPACA reinsurance fee amounts, payment schedule - Business Insurance", "url": "http://www.businessinsurance.com/article/20140306/NEWS03/140309892", "image": "http://www.businessinsurance.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/CB/20140306/NEWS03/140309892/AR/0/department-of-health-and-human-services.jpg", "type": "article"}, "image_src": "http://www.businessinsurance.com/assets/rwd/bi-logo-footer.png", "description": "Employers will be allowed to pay a controversial health care reform law fee in two installments and have certainty on the amount of the fee during the second year of the three-year program under final rules issued Wednesday by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.Authorized by the...", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no, minimal-ui", "title": "Final HHS rules set PPACA reinsurance fee amounts, payment schedule - Business Insurance"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2c04\"", "article_summary": "Like the earlier proposed rules, the final rules will exempt \u2014 for 2015 and 2016 only \u2014 self-insured and self-administered plans from the fees.\nTherefore, in consideration of the comments received, we are finalizing our proposal to collect contributions via two payments,\u201d the final rules said.\nEarlier, HHS had set the first-year fee at $63 per plan participant and had proposed a $44 fee for the second year.\nThe final rules affirm the $44 fee for the second year.\nHHS has not proposed the amount of the fee for the third and last year of the program."}
