Here, the probabilities of rising from the bottom 20% to the top 20% range widely, between just 6.7% (one-third less than in the best locales) down to merely 2.6% (around one-quarter of the probability in the best locales), among these 21 bottom-ranked cities.\n\nIn other words: virtually all of this nation\u2019s class-rigidity still remains in the U.S. South, even after the Civil War. New Dixie has replaced the aristocracy\u2019s black slaves of Old Dixie, by the local (white) aristocracy\u2019s institutionalized bigotry against poor people, now of all ethnic groups. What used to be their purely racist bigotry has, it seems, devolved into a crushing, pervasive, classist, bigotry in the South.\n\nExplaining this would produce controversy, and unfortunately the researchers don\u2019t even try. However, it is a striking finding, which demands an explanation.\n\nFor a century after Abraham Lincoln was shot in 1865, the North\u2019s Protestant aristocracy increasingly supported the Republican Party, which gradually became, in a sense, the new version of the old aristocratic Southern Democratic Party, but now spread nationwide: oriented more toward concerns about the \u201cfree market\u201d than about democracy. Government became subordinated to economics\u2014not just any economics, but \u201cfree market\u201d economics, whereas economics had virtually nothing to do with the U.S. Constitution, which was instead concerned with political matters: government.\n\nWith the advent of Democratic President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, and his \u201cNew Deal\u201d reforms and regulations during the Great Depression, and his starting of the Social Security system, this aristocratic hostility toward the Democratic Party intensified even more.\n\nIn FDR\u2019s re-nomination acceptance speech in 1936, he said, \u201cEconomic royalists complain that we seek to overthrow the institutions of America. What they really complain of is that we seek to take away their power. Our allegiance to American institutions requires the overthrow of this kind of power. In vain they seek to hide behind the flag and the Constitution.\u201d This was a speech that could be given today.\n\nThen, as if to add insult to Protestant aristocratic outrage, the Catholic Democratic President John F. Kennedy finally committed the Democratic Party against the unquestionably bigoted South; and next, the remarkably progressive Democratic Texan President Lyndon Baines Johnson fatefully sealed this FDR-type Democratic Party, with the Civil Rights Acts, and also Medicare and Medicaid \u2014all done to serve mainly the very same people, the middle-class and the poor, whom aristocrats traditionally have wanted instead to be suppressed, if not again enslaved (such as was the case in the Old South). For example, labor unions are routinely suppressed by aristocrats, because such unions challenge the \u201cfree market\u201d\u2014 they challenge aristocrats\u2019 hired managers, who no longer possess unrestrained control when a labor union is present.\n\nAristocrats call this \u201cfree market\u201d of theirs simply \u201cfreedom,\u201d meaning their own freedom, but also meaning (though never mentioning) the \u201cfreedom\u201d of millions of have-nots to suffer unto their graves (via such class-rigidity as prevails especially in the South, and in underdeveloped countries around the world). These financial elite also sometimes call this free-market economics \u201ctough love.\u201d But no matter what the rationalization, the result for its victims is basically like a kiss of death; this is more that type of \u201clove,\u201d even when the proponents themselves actually sincerely believe it to be some sort of \u201clove,\u201d for the people who are actually suffering from this one-sided \u201cfreedom\u201d of the aristocracy.\n\nRepublicans are proud of this \u201cfreedom,\u201d or \u201cdiscipline,\u201d or \u201ctough love\u201d: they even sometimes call it the \u201copportunity society.\u201d That\u2019s what pervades the South, the very same region of this country where economic opportunity is actually the lowest.\n\nHowever, apparently enough Americans support this Orwellian operation, so that Republicans constitute a major party, which includes some of the very same people who suffer from it. This is the only way to explain the continued existence of the Republican Party as being a major political party in the U.S.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Despite platitudes about opportunity, America's southern states suffer the greatest income inequality", "title": "Class warfare in Dixieland", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Despite platitudes about opportunity, America's southern states suffer the greatest income inequality", "title": "Class warfare in Dixieland", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2013/12/20/class_warfare_in_dixieland/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2012/05/confederate_flag_rect.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Despite platitudes about opportunity, America's southern states suffer the greatest income inequality", "title": "Class warfare in Dixieland", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2012/05/confederate_flag_rect.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Eric Zuesse", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, AlterNet, American South, class, Income inequality, Inequality", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Government became subordinated to economics\u2014not just any economics, but \u201cfree market\u201d economics, whereas economics had virtually nothing to do with the U.S. Constitution, which was instead concerned with political matters: government.\nFor example, labor unions are routinely suppressed by aristocrats, because such unions challenge the \u201cfree market\u201d\u2014 they challenge aristocrats\u2019 hired managers, who no longer possess unrestrained control when a labor union is present.\nIn other words: virtually all of this nation\u2019s class-rigidity still remains in the U.S. South, even after the Civil War.\nWhat used to be their purely racist bigotry has, it seems, devolved into a crushing, pervasive, classist, bigotry in the South.\nThis is the only way to explain the continued existence of the Republican Party as being a major political party in the U.S."}
