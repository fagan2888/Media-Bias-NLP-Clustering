They are produced by growing viruses in animal cells. The main difference between them and regular flu vaccines is that the influenza A and B viruses are grown in mammalian cells rather than hens\u2019 eggs. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), cell-based flu vaccines are being developed due to a higher level of flexibility over egg-based vaccines. This process would also provide a faster way to develop vaccines in the case of a flu pandemic, as the cells used are frozen and stored to ensure availability.\n\nThe cell-based technology that has been approved is located at a facility in Holly Springs, North Carolina. The FDA\u2019s approval of Flucelvax in 2012 allowed this technique to be used for the first time throughout the U.S., though it\u2019s been available in various European countries for some time. Now, the Novartis Holly Springs facility will be the first in the U.S. to manufacture Flucelvax. \u201cThis new capability demonstrates the effectiveness of a multi-use approach to emergency preparedness,\u201d Robin Robinson, Director and Deputy Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR) at Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, said in a statement.\n\n\"Cell-culture technology is the first major advancement in influenza vaccine production in the US in more than 40 years. We are proud to be at the forefront of this innovation, which will allow us to deliver on our public health and health security commitments,\" Andrin Oswald, Division Head of Novartis Vaccines, said in a news release. \"With this award-winning, state-of-the-art facility, we will be able to not only offer US consumers an antibiotic- and preservative-free alternative for the yearly seasonal flu vaccination, but also be better prepared for future pandemic threats.\" Cell-based vaccines have been used for polio, rotavirus, hepatitis, smallpox, rubella and chickenpox.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "flu vaccine, cell-based flu vaccine, influenza", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "In what the HHS calls a \u201cmilestone\u201d in battling influenza, the FDA has recently allowed a U.S. facility\u2019s to manufacture a cell-based flu vaccine.", "title": "A \u2018Milestone\u2019 In Fighting Influenza: Cell-Based Flu Vaccine Approved By FDA", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/milestone-fighting-influenza-fda-approves-us-facility-manufacture-cell-based-flu-vaccine-288720", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/17/flu-vaccine.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "In what the HHS calls a \u201cmilestone\u201d in battling influenza, the FDA has recently allowed a U.S. facility\u2019s to manufacture a cell-based flu vaccine.", "title": "A \u2018Milestone\u2019 In Fighting Influenza: Cell-Based Flu Vaccine Approved By FDA", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/milestone-fighting-influenza-fda-approves-us-facility-manufacture-cell-based-flu-vaccine-288720", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/17/flu-vaccine.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/17/flu-vaccine.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2014-06-17T18:33:10-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-06-17T19:06:46-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "In what the HHS calls a \u201cmilestone\u201d in battling influenza, the FDA has recently allowed a U.S. facility\u2019s to manufacture a cell-based flu vaccine."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0158\"", "article_summary": "Cell-based flu vaccines, or cell culture technology, are an alternative to the traditional egg-based process used to make regular flu vaccines.\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), cell-based flu vaccines are being developed due to a higher level of flexibility over egg-based vaccines.\nThough a cell-based flu vaccine named Flucelvax was approved by the FDA in 2012, the approval of this particular facility would increase the capacity for seasonal influenza vaccine production \u201cby at least 50 million doses,\u201d an HHS statement reads.\n\"Cell-culture technology is the first major advancement in influenza vaccine production in the US in more than 40 years.\nThe cell-based technology that has been approved is located at a facility in Holly Springs, North Carolina."}
