Details about the what each company and group is doing can be read here.\n\nHHS Secretary Sylvia Burwell said, \"We are working to provide taxpayers with the tools and information they need to file their returns and answer their questions.\"\n\nBurwell's department has also rolled out online resources of its own to help people understand the tax effects of Obamacare, as has the Internal Revenue Service.\n\nThis year is the first that tax filers will be required to declare on their income tax returns whether they had health coverage. The ACA required people to have such coverage, be it through their employers' health plans, privately purchased insurance, Medicare or Medicaid, or face a tax penalty.\n\nThis is also the first year that people who received federal tax credits that helped them pay premiums for health plans purchased on government-run Obamacare exchanges are required to file forms that reconcile the money they received with their incomes.\n\nThe tax credits were based on estimates of annual income people made when they applied for the insurance plans, so some people will owe the government money back, and others will get more money than they did if their actual incomes were different from their estimates.\n\nThe Treasury Department does not have official estimates on how many people will owe refunds for subsidies they received, or how many people will get additional money as a result of underestimating their incomes. But the department, according to a senior official who spoke on background, expects that the majority of people who do end up owing money back from their subsidies will owe an amount that is less than what they are owed in their overall tax refund.", "article_metadata": {"AssetType": "cnbcnewsstory", "description": "Obama administration officials have partnered with large tax preparers and nonprofits to educate people about the tax effects of Obamacare.", "news_keywords": "Obamacare, tax penalty, IRS, taxes right, preparers, tax fines, filers", "author": "Dan Mangan", "og": {"site_name": "CNBC", "description": "Obama administration officials have partnered with large tax preparers and nonprofits to educate people about the tax effects of Obamacare.", "title": "Obamacare tax could hit 6M, but lots more avoid", "url": "http://www.cnbc.com/2015/01/28/getting-obamacare-related-tax-returns-right.html", "image": "http://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2015/01/28/102376890-458860356.1910x1000.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Obama administration officials have partnered with large tax preparers and nonprofits to educate people about the tax effects of Obamacare.", "creator": "@_DanMangan", "url": "http://www.cnbc.com/2015/01/28/getting-obamacare-related-tax-returns-right.html", "image": {"src": "http://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2015/01/28/102376890-458860356.1910x1000.jpg"}, "title": "Obamacare tax could hit 6 million\u2014but lots more will duck it", "site": "@CNBC", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "al": {"ios": {"app_name": "CNBC Business News and Finance", "app_store_id": 398018310}}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=398018310", "keywords": "Health Insurance, Health Care, Health Insurance, Obamacare, Taxes, US: News, Politics, H & R Block Inc, Jackson Hewitt Tax Service Inc, Treasury Department, IRS, business news", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/cnbc", "published_time": "2015-01-28T16:11:18-0500", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/dan.mangan.54", "section": "Health Insurance", "modified_time": "2015-01-28T16:56:03-0500", "tag": "IRS"}, "pageNodeId": 102376837, "GOOGLEBOT": "unavailable_after: 31 Dec 9999 23:59:59 GMT"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0bec\"", "article_summary": "The groups and companies are offering a combination of in-person assistance and online assistance during this tax season.\nThis year is the first that tax filers will be required to declare on their income tax returns whether they had health coverage.\nThe ACA required people to have such coverage, be it through their employers' health plans, privately purchased insurance, Medicare or Medicaid, or face a tax penalty.\nLarge tax firms and preparation software involved in the initiative include H&R Block, Jackson Hewitt, Liberty Tax Service, TurboTax and FileYourTaxes.com, according to a press release issued by HHS.\nSome consumer advocates have called on the Obama administration to align the Obamacare enrollment season with tax season, because that is the time when most Americans are getting a refund, which in turn could make it easier or more desirable to buy an insurance plan."}
