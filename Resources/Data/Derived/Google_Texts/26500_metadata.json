You'll never get there!\n\n\n\nERIC BOLLING (2/26/2014): In five months, 4 \u2014 allegedly, 4 \u2014 million people have signed up. They expect to get 3 more million in one month? Wow, this is going to be a disaster.\n\nSo deadline passed. Give us the total.\n\n\n\nBARACK OBAMA (4/1/2014): 7.1 million Americans have now signed up for private insurance plans through these marketplaces. 7.1.\n\nSTEVE DOOCY (4/2/2014): How real are those numbers? CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER (4/1/2014): This is a phony number. FOX NEWS GUEST (4/1/2014): I actually think the White House is straight up lying about these numbers. BRAD BLAKEMAN (4/3/2014): This is a sham!

JOHN BARRASSO, R-WY (3/30/2014): I think they're cooking the books on this.\n\nSo how do you explain this rather fortuitous increase?\n\n\n\nBARACK OBAMA (4/1/2014): 7.1 million folks have health insurance because people got the word out. And we didn't make a hard sell.\n\nWord of mouth, really? You didn't make a hard sell? The signup was the centerpiece of your State of the Union address. You talked it up on Ellen, on Rachel Ray, on The Tonight Show, enlisted an army of professional athletes,\n\nevery actor in Hollywood,\n\nyou sat between two ferns! (audience applause)\n\nAnd then, there was whatever the hell this is!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo listen to me,\n\nA talking pup you see,\n\nIf you get health insurance\n\nPreventive care is now free.\n\nDidn't give the hard sell?? For God's sake, you taught a dog to rap about health insurance! Even the Taco Bell chihuahua was like, \"Yo quiero we get it.\" (audience laughter)\n\nBut apparently, according to Brent Bozell of the conservative Media Research Bullshit \u2014 I mean, Center (audience laughter) \u2014 the government had a secret Obamacare enrollment selling weapon.\n\n\n\nBRENT BOZELL (3/31/2014): For more than a year, the Spanish-language television network Univision has embarked on their own company-wide effort to get Latinos signed up for the exchanges.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Daily Kos", "description": "Last night, Jon Stewart mocked the right-wing reaction to the successful Obamacare enrollment numbers, and had Al Madrigal explain Fox News's fevered ravings about how the Spanish TV stations here ...", "title": "Jon Stewart mocks right-wing disbelief over Obamacare enrollments", "url": "http://www.dailykos.com/story/2014/4/9/1290707/-Jon-Stewart-mocks-right-wing-disbelief-over-Obamacare-enrollments", "image": "http://www.dailykos.com/assets/fb_default.png", "type": "article"}, "csrf-param": "authenticity_token", "fb": {"app_id": 170357783709}, "twitter": {"description": "Last night, Jon Stewart mocked the right-wing reaction to the successful Obamacare enrollment numbers, and had Al Madrigal explain Fox News's fevered ravings about how the Spanish TV stations here ...", "title": "Jon Stewart mocks right-wing disbelief over Obamacare enrollments", "site": "@dailykos", "card": "summary", "creator": "@BruinKid"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9ba5\"", "article_summary": "BARACK OBAMA (4/1/2014): 7.1 million folks have health insurance because people got the word out.\nFor God's sake, you taught a dog to rap about health insurance!\nBARACK OBAMA (4/1/2014): 7.1 million Americans have now signed up for private insurance plans through these marketplaces.\nAnd we didn't make a hard sell.\nYou didn't make a hard sell?"}
