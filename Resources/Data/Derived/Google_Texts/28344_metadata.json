In 2007, during a speech on parental notification for abortion, Garcia said that \u201ca pregnant teen \u2014 I mean, most women are emotional roller coasters \u2014 but a pregnant teen is an emotional roller coaster going at warp-speed.\u201d\n\nGarcia also has voted against bills that would prohibit employment discrimination against victims of domestic violence, prohibit punishing employees who file complaints relating to paycheck equity and create buffer zones around abortion clinics. In a March interview, she said that she opposes the Violence Against Women Act because New Hampshire state law protects women. Domestic violence only became a distinct crime in new Hampshire earlier this year.\n\nThe race currently leans Democrat. Rep. Ann McLane Custer is leading by around 11 percent, according to the latest polling.\n\nNew Hampshire Republicans are taking flack this week after GOP Senate nominee Scott Brown dismissed women\u2019s rights as issues people don\u2019t care about. He said that while \u201cwomen\u2019s issues are very important,\u201d his focus is on things \u201cpeople care about,\u201d such as \u201cimmigration, border security, veterans\u2019 issues, where we stand when it comes to Obamacare.\u201d In September, Brown distanced himself from the New Hampshire Republican Party when they endorsed personhood, an extreme measure that would outlaw all abortion and possibly some forms of contraception.\n\nDuring his time in the Senate representing Massachusetts, Brown had a mixed record on women\u2019s issues; he voted against the Paycheck Fairness Act but voted for the reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act. He also cosponsored a bill that would have allowed employers limit coverage of contraception for moral reasons.\n\nWomen\u2019s issues have been playing a large role in this election. An August poll from Emily\u2019s List found that 70 percent of \u201cdrop off\u201d women voters said that the chance to vote against an anti-choice candidate was \u201cvery motivating.\u201d The poll also found that 44 percent of swing voters said that reproductive rights were their top reason to vote for a Democratic candidate and that messaging about women\u2019s health made voters more likely to vote for a generic Democratic candidate. Since the 1980s, women have been more likely to identify as Democrats, and Obama won the women\u2019s vote by 11 percent in 2012.\n\nBut the GOP\u2019s efforts to change their messaging to be less offensive to women so far are falling flat; a recent poll by two Republican groups found that women consider the party to be \u201cintolerant\u201d and \u201cstuck in the past,\u201d and that 49 percent of them have a negative view of Republicans. Outside of New Hampshire, Democrats in North Carolina, Iowa, Colorado and Alaska have been criticizing their Republican opponents for their stance on women\u2019s issues, specifically their opposition to reproductive rights.\n\nAmelia Rosch is an intern for ThinkProgress.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "The Republican candidate for the House of Representatives called women \"emotional rollercoasters.\"", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "The Republican candidate for the House of Representatives called women \"emotional rollercoasters.\"", "title": "House Candidate Who Called Women \u2018Emotional Rollercoasters\u2019 Says No One Cares About Women\u2019s Rights", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/politics/2014/10/03/3575505/nh-gop-women/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/AP699339648958-e1412345948564.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The Republican candidate for the House of Representatives called women \"emotional rollercoasters.\"", "title": "House Candidate Who Called Women \u2018Emotional Rollercoasters\u2019 Says No One Cares About Women\u2019s Rights", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/AP699339648958-321x214.jpg", "creator": "@lifesarosch", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-politics", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/AP699339648958-e1412345948564.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/AP699339648958-e1412345948564.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2014-10-03T10:52:15+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb567\"", "article_summary": "Politics House Candidate Who Called Women \u2018Emotional Rollercoasters\u2019 Says No One Cares About Women\u2019s Rights CREDIT: AP Images - Jim Cole New Hampshire GOP candidates Scott Brown (second to right) and Marilinda Garcia (far right) have both criticized Democrats' focus on women's issues.\nThroughout her time in the state house, Garcia has made anti-women comments and has a record of voting against bills supporting women\u2019s issues.\nWomen\u2019s issues have been playing a large role in this election.\nOutside of New Hampshire, Democrats in North Carolina, Iowa, Colorado and Alaska have been criticizing their Republican opponents for their stance on women\u2019s issues, specifically their opposition to reproductive rights.\nSince the 1980s, women have been more likely to identify as Democrats, and Obama won the women\u2019s vote by 11 percent in 2012."}
