Rick Santorum (R-PA) and Rep. Cresent Hardy being stumped when asked to list any of his accomplishments, Republican presidential candidate Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) chalked it up to them signing up at the last second.\n\nPartial transcript as follows:\n\nWALLACE: Let\u2019s talk about your record. This week, a Nevada congressman, Crescent Hardy, endorsed you. But like Rick Santorum, the former senator before him, he had some trouble listing any accomplishment of you during your time in the Senate. Here he is.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nQUESTION: Is there one thing you could name over the last year that you\u2019ve seen firsthand on The Hill that he has done that demonstrates presidential character, to be able to get things done?\n\nCRESCENT HARDY, NEVADA CONGRESSMAN: On the Hill, I have not seen that. He\u2019s been running for a presidential race most of this year.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nWALLACE: Senator, why can\u2019t officials who support you, who come out to endorse you, name a specific accomplishment of your time in the Senate?\n\nRUBIO: Well, in fairness to these folks, right, they\u2019re signing up at the last second. They\u2019re inspired by our message. They want to be a part of our team. We haven\u2019t provided them, you know, all this information. I\u2019m more than happy to tell you about my record. I\u2019m very proud of it.\n\nWALLACE: Incidentally, maybe you ought to start doing that, huh?\n\nRUBIO: For example, we passed sanctions \u2014 yes, well, we are, and we do, but we, obviously, you can\u2019t make people read something. And these are last minute things. It\u2019s not fair to them.\n\nHere\u2019s the bottom line, I\u2019m more than happy to talk about our record. And I mean it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s \u2014 number one, I\u2019ve worked in the Senate where for four out of the last five years nothing happened because of Harry Reid. And yet, despite that, I actually worked with Bernie Sanders, who I don\u2019t agree on anything, but we were able to work together to bring V.A. accountability. You can now fire senior executives at the V.A. because of my work.\n\nThere are now additional sanctions on Hezbollah because I got the Senate to pass that unanimously, but the way. We passed the Girls Count Act, which goes after human trafficking by \u2014 by leveraging foreign aid from the United States government to ensure that all kids around the world are getting birth certificates so they don\u2019t fall prey to modern day slavery.\n\nWe led the effort to deal with the Obamacare bailout fund before anyone was talking about that. We were out there leading the effort on that. And today the Obamacare bailout fund is gone.\n\nWALLACE: Well, what \u2014\n\nRUBIO: We helped impose sanctions on human rights violators in Venezuela.\n\nWALLACE: Senator, one thing \u2014\n\nRUBIO: And I\u2019m very proud of what we\u2019ve done despite the fact that Washington isn\u2019t doing anything.\n\nWALLACE: Senator, one of the things that you don\u2019t mention, and I think everybody would say was your biggest accomplishment, was the Gang of Eight comprehensive immigration reform bill that was passed in 2013. Let me ask you a question, was that a good bill? Was that a reasonable compromise on the immigration problem?\n\nRUBIO: Not \u2014 not as a final package. And I said that at the time, Chris. And if you go back \u2014 and we\u2019ll provide you that \u2014 you\u2019ll see that throughout that debate in the Senate, I kept saying over and over, this is the best we can do here in this Senate, run by Harry Reid, but this is going to have to change when it gets to the House. It\u2019s not strong enough. I\u2019ve said that repeatedly. That\u2019s how the process works. You know that.\n\nWALLACE: But \u2014 but you said you supported \u2014 you said you supported the bill when \u2014 after passage. And you said during the \u2014 the fight that it had important reforms that conservatives had been working for, for years. I mean you voted for it.\n\nRUBIO: It did. Well, sure, because it\u2019s the best we could do in a Senate run by Harry Reid. And we did get the Democrats to agree on a lot of things conservatives have pushed for, but it wasn\u2019t enough. And I warned about that repeatedly. I said, this is now going to go to the House and they\u2019re going to make it even stronger.\n\nBut here\u2019s the good news, when I\u2019m president of the United States, we\u2019re not going to do it that way. I don\u2019t need to do it Harry Reid\u2019s way. We can do it our way, which is, we\u2019re going to enforce our laws and we\u2019re going to secure our border first. And until we do that, nothing else is going to happen on immigration.\n\nWALLACE: Finally, let\u2019s talk about Super Tuesday. I don\u2019t have to point out to you, you have not won a state yet. In the polls of all 11 states who are people \u2014 will go to the polls on Tuesday, you are trailing. If you go through Super Tuesday and you still haven\u2019t won a state, can you still be a viable candidate?\n\nRUBIO: Oh, absolutely. First of all, Super Tuesday is going to award a lot of delegates, and we\u2019re going to pick up a lot of delegates. Here\u2019s the bottom line, you need 1,237 delegates to be the Republican nominee. Donald Trump will never have that number of delegates. I don\u2019t care how long I have to work. I\u2019ll go to all 50 states and every territory. He will never get those delegates. I am going to get those delegates, and I will be the Republican nominee.\n\nWALLACE: But you \u2014 you could go 0-15 and you could still be the nominee?\n\nRUBIO: And we\u2019re going to pick up a lot of delegates this week.\n\nWALLACE: You could still be 0-15 and \u2014 and \u2014 and be the nominee?\n\nRUBIO: Because we\u2019re going to pick up a lot of delegates. Sure. And that\u2019s not the plan, by the way, but sure. I mean absolutely we can because we\u2019re going to pick up a lot of delegates. And we\u2019re going to pick up a lot of delegates next week. And then come March 15th, I expect this race will be significantly narrowed. More Americans will now know the truth about Donald Trump after we\u2019ve spent two weeks banging away on it, and people will see what they\u2019re about to fall con to, and then we are going to start winning states when the states start awarding all of their delegates, and that includes Florida. We feel very optimistic about that, now more than ever especially.\n\nWALLACE: Senator Rubio, thank you. Thanks for taking the time to talk with us.
