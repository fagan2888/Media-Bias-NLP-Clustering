Several hundred organizers clad in blue marched in Washington, D.C. on Saturday to show support for law enforcement in response to nationwide racial concerns over policing tactics.

The march, which was organized by the wives of three local police officers, began at the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial and ended with a rally outside the Capitol building.

Marchers carried signs with the slogan “Blue lives matter” a play off of the national #blacklivesmatter that trended following a series of deaths of unarmed black men at the hands of white police officers.

Organizers at the “Sea of Blue” march said on Twitter that the event was “long overdue” and were fed up with the anti-police attitudes that led to the killings of two NYPD officers last month.

Others used the social media platform to criticize the march, blasting organizers for turning the national conversation into an issue of “us v. them.”

“Speakers take an ‘Us vs Them’ stance on Policing,” one user said, tweeting photos from the event.

“Doubtful MLK would use the #BlueLivesMatter HT,” another female user tweeted.

The march comes just after reports of a shooting in St. Alberta, Canada that sent two officers to the hospital.

The officers were shot around 3 a.m. MT Saturday while confronting a suspect about a stolen vehicle found near a casino, Canada’s CBC reported.

One officer is in critical condition and the other officer’s condition is described as “very grave” Royal Canadian Mounted Police Asst. Comm. Martin Degrend, told CBC.
