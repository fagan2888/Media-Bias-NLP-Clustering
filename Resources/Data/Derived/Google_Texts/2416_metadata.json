After continuous attempts to contact him for four days, Mr. Iuso's family came to the hospital Monday morning, demanding to see hospital surveillance footage.

CMS launches new ACO dialysis model\n\nCMS is launching a new accountable care organization model to improve care coordination for patients with kidney failure and control costs for end-stage renal disease treatments. The model, called the Comprehensive ESRD Care Model, is based off CMS' experience with other programs, such as the Pioneer ACO and Medicare Shared Savings Program. Under the CEC Model, nephrologists and other providers team up with dialysis facilities to create ESRD Seamless Care Organizations, which function like ACOs. The model is meant to prompt providers to support patients both in and out of the dialysis facility. ESCOs are at risk for Medicare Part A and B spending, dialysis services and quality outcomes of their assigned beneficiaries.\n\n9.
