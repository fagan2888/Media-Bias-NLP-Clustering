His financial skills with his company Berkshire Hathaway have led to him being dubbed \u201cThe Oracle from Omaha.\u201d\n\nMr. Buffett is the second-richest man in America, just behind Microsoft Founder Bill Gates. Mr. Buffett is the third-richest man in the world. His net worth is estimated at $44.6 billion.\n\nSo there is one obvious question that needs to be asked.\n\nWhy am I subsidizing Warren Buffett?\n\nMr. Buffett\u2019s company receives subsides from the government to build unprofitable wind turbine farms to generate power from the wind. Mr. Buffett has been quite candid about why he does this.\n\nBack in April, Mr. Buffett made the following statement: \u201cI will do anything that is basically covered by the law to reduce Berkshire\u2019s tax rate. For example, on wind energy, we get a tax credit if we build a lot of wind farms. That\u2019s the only reason to build them. They don\u2019t make sense without the tax credit.\u201d\n\nWhat does that mean in plain English?\n\nIt means taxpayers are subsidizing Mr. Buffett and Berkshire Hathaway.\n\nWhat it means is there are millions of real Americans out there worried about their jobs and their kids\u2019 futures who are subsidizing the second-richest man in America.\n\nIt means there are millions of real Americans who have lost their health insurance or who have seen their health care costs skyrocket who are subsidizing the third-richest man in the world.\n\nDuring the 2012 election, Barack Obama repeatedly invoked the so-called \u201cBuffett Rule\u201d against Mitt Romney. This is something Buffett allegedly came up with that said the rich should pay at least 30 percent of their income in taxes.\n\nMr. Buffett is simply a liberal hypocrite. He claims he thinks the wealthy should pay their \u201cfair share\u201d of taxes, yet does everything possible to minimize his personal and corporate tax liability.\n\nCongress returns next week for the lame duck session of Congress. The Democrats have stated reauthorization of the Wind Power Production Tax Credit, the Buffett subsidy, is one of their major priorities. This is one of the reasons why so many of these wealthy liberals like Tom Steyer, contributed so heavily to Democrats this year. They want their cronyist payback.\n\nWhen the Republicans in the House of Representatives crafted their tax package this year, they killed the Wind Power Production Tax Credit. The credit had expired at the end of 2013 and the House GOP made certain it stayed dead. Unfortunately, these subsidies are like monsters in 1950s-era horror movies. You aren\u2019t really sure if they are dead until the credits roll and even then they could be back for a sequel. If this were a horror movie, this subsidy might be called \u201cThe Creature from the Potomac Lagoon.\u201d\n\nIf this past week\u2019s elections said anything, it said Americans are tired of the crony-liberalism that has been going on since the Obama Regime took over. Real Americans are tired of the government being used to enrich the well connected while everyone else suffers.\n\nIn the lame duck session, deals will be cut quickly and the bills will be Nancy Pelosi specials. In other words, the senators and members of Congress will have to pass the bills to see what is in them.\n\nThat isn\u2019t what the American people voted for.\n\nThe House Republicans should make it clear that they are going to come in, fund the government until January and let the new GOP majority vote on the spending priorities.\n\nOne thing almost everyone agrees on is that real Americans don\u2019t need to be subsidizing Mr. Buffett.\n\nMr. Buffett has done quite well on his own.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Congress returns next week for the Lame Duck session of Congress.
