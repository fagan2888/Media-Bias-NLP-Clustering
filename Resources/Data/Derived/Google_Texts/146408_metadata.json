It was clear and concise.\n\nIt outlawed the following methods: \u201cTorture, cruel, inhuman, degrading treatment or punishment, or prolonged detention without charges or trial.\u201d It was based on five decades of experience.\n\nRelated: War Powers for Obama: How Far Should a President Go?\n\nPresident George W. Bush, Vice President Dick Cheney and the leaders of the CIA threw out the rule book as they set out on their global crusade against terrorism. This was unwise.\n\nAnyone who was in New York or Washington after 9/11 remembers the fear \u2014 every day, every night, every time the phone rang \u2014 that there would be another attack. I sat down with George Tenet, the director of Central Intelligence, not long after 9/11. The exhaustion, the fear \u2014 and the terror \u2014 that I saw in his eyes is an image I will never forget.\n\nFear trumped wisdom for the next seven years.\n\nCIA Director John Brennan said on Thursday that some intelligence officers used \u201cabhorrent\u201d methods on the people they detained after the attacks. He said it was \u201cunknowable\u201d whether the so-called enhanced interrogation techniques \u2014 EITs, in CIA jargon, torture in plain English \u2014 yielded useful intelligence.\n\nRelated: CIA Torture Report Casts New Light on GITMO Prisoners\n\n\u201cWe have not concluded that it was the use of EITs,\u201d Brennan said, \u201c\u2026 that allowed us to obtain useful information from detainees.\u201d\n\nThis much we know: The CIA threw out the rule book instructing its officers that torture does not work as a method of gathering intelligence. And out with the rule book went the agency\u2019s institutional knowledge and hard-won wisdom.\n\nDuring the Korean War, the CIA created clandestine prisons \u2014 the biggest was in the Panama Canal Zone \u2014 where suspected Russian double agents were injected with drugs and brutally interrogated. The agency gave four suspected North Korean double agents the same treatment in occupied Japan.\n\n\u201cLike Guantanamo,\u201d a charter member of the CIA, Tom Polgar, told me in a 2005 interview. \u201cIt was anything goes.\u201d\n\nRelated: $443M GITMO Fight Could Lead to Another Executive Order\n\nThe CIA searched for many years for a magic potion \u2014 a truth serum that would draw confessions from incarcerated subjects, especially suspected enemy spies \u2014 using LSD, heroin, amphetamines and other \u201cspecial techniques in CIA interrogations,\u201d to quote from a 1952 CIA report.\n\nThe legendary CIA Director Allen Dulles approved an expanded program code-named ULTRA, in which, to cite one among many examples, seven prisoners at a federal penitentiary in Kentucky were dosed with LSD daily for 11 weeks. When the agency slipped the drug to an unsuspecting army civilian employee named Frank Olson, he jumped out of the window of a New York hotel.\n\nAll the subjects of these tests were human guinea pigs in the Cold War. They were expendable. The CIA destroyed most of the records of these tests. But a 1956 progress report described the continuing \u201cplanning of overseas interrogations\u201d and new \u201cspecial interrogation\u201d techniques under research and development.\n\nIn 1964, the CIA secretly incarcerated Yuri Nosenko, a KGB defector, suspecting he knew something about the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. With the approval of Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy, the CIA threw Nosenko into a secret prison at the CIA\u2019s training grounds in Virginia. As if in a Soviet gulag, under a single bare light burning 24 hours a day, Nosenko suffered psychological assault, physical hardship and solitary confinement for nearly four years.\n\nRelated: Torture Report - Another Obama Insult to Allies\n\nCIA Director Richard Helms finally determined that the agency had kept an innocent man \u201cin durance vile \u2026 against the laws of the United States.\u201d\n\nDuring the Vietnam War, thousands of enemy combatants were interrogated, often fatally, in search of intelligence under the CIA\u2019s Phoenix program. But that search proved largely futile. Helms said the CIA \u201ccould not determine what was going on\u201d inside the enemy\u2019s camp. At the root of this failure was \u201cour national ignorance of Vietnamese history, society and language,\u201d Helms lamented. That was, in part, why the enemy won the war.\n\nWhen Nosenko died in 2008, Clair George, a former chief of the CIA\u2019s clandestine service, told The Washington Post that his incarceration had been \u201ca terrible mistake.\u201d But after all, George said: \u201cYou can\u2019t be in the spy business without making mistakes.\u201d\n\nWhat, then, did we learn from our mistakes with \u201cenhanced interrogation techniques\u201d \u2014 or, if you prefer, torture?\n\nRelated: The CIA's Spying on Senate Staff Complicates Torture Report\n\nThe CIA had firmly rejected cruel and unusual punishment, Richard Stolz, chief of the clandestine service under Presidents Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush, said in 1988 \u2014 \u201cnot only because it is wrong, but because it has historically proven to be ineffective.\u201d The CIA\u2019s 1990s codes of conduct stated: \u201cInhumane physical or psychological techniques are counterproductive because they do not produce intelligence and will probably result in false answers.\u201d\n\nI added the emphases for reasons that may be obvious. Former leaders of the CIA \u2013 and Cheney \u2014 insist that torture works.\n\nThat is false. The Senate report released Wednesday makes this painfully clear. It uses the CIA\u2019s own records to make an irrefutable case. The report contains no great revelations about violations of the Geneva Convention in the CIA\u2019s secret prisons, the \u201cblack sites.\u201d\n\nBut it shows that the claim that torture worked is a delusion, and the insistence that it produced unique intelligence is a lie.\n\n\u201cThe use of the CIA\u2019s enhanced interrogation techniques was not an effective means of obtaining accurate information or gaining detainee cooperation,\u201d the Senate report says. \u201cMultiple CIA detainees fabricated information, resulting in faulty intelligence \u2026 on critical intelligence issues, including the terrorist threats which the CIA identified as its highest priorities.\u201d\n\nThis information comes from the CIA\u2019s own records. And false intelligence is worse than no intelligence.\n\nRelated: Prosecutions for CIA Torture Still Seem Unlikely After Senate Report\n\nThe report looks at 20 of the most prominent examples of \u201cpurported counterterrorism successes that the CIA has attributed to the use of its enhanced interrogation techniques.\u201d In some of those cases, \u201cthere was no relationship between the cited counterterrorism success and any information provided by detainees.\u201d In the rest of the 20 cases, \u201cthe CIA inaccurately claimed that specific, otherwise unavailable information was acquired from a CIA detainee \u2018as a result\u2019 of the CIA\u2019s enhanced interrogation techniques.\u201d\n\nThese are lies that CIA officers told to themselves, to one another and then repeated to their colleagues in the government of the United States.\n\nWe must leave the questions of deception for another day, but they begin with self-deception \u2014 a grave danger in the business of secret intelligence.\n\nBetter to conclude with two pieces of wisdom. One is something Helms told me a long time ago. He started out in the CIA in the very beginning, back in 1947, and served as director for seven years \u2014 until President Richard M. Nixon cut his throat, figuratively speaking, in 1972. Helms was talking about political assassination. Let\u2019s forget about the laws of man and God and war, he said. It\u2019s a practical question: If you try to kill their leaders, why shouldn\u2019t they try to kill yours?\n\nRelated: John Dean on Nixon, Impeachment and Obama\n\nA professionally distinguished and highly intelligent former FBI counterterrorism agent, Ali H. Soufan, said much the same today on page one of The New York Times. His words broke my heart, hardened by six postings in Afghanistan. Soufan knows whereof he speaks: He witnessed, and warned against, the use of torture by the CIA in the darkest days of the black sites.\n\n\u201cWe played into the enemy\u2019s hands,\u201d he said. \u201cNow we have American hostages in orange jumpsuits because we put people in orange jumpsuits.\u201d\n\nTim Weiner is a Pulitzer Prize-winning former national security correspondent for The New York Times.
