Bostic Sr., pastor of the Mt. Olive Apostolic Original Holy Church Of God. \u201cThere should be a rule for the whole city, not only one part.\u201d\n\nThe City Council last month approved spending $127,682 to buy the cameras and the Automated License Plate Recognition (ALPR) devices, which police Cmdr. Dave Bertini praised as \u201ca great investigative tool.\u201d Bertini said some residents of Belle Haven, frustrated by criminal activity, suggested the cameras. \u201cLast year, there were numerous shootings \u2026 and people were very tense,\u201d he said.\n\nAlthough they voted 5-0 to authorize the license-plate readers, council members raised questions about how long the data would be stored and who would have access to it. Council members Ray Mueller and Kirsten Keith will work with City Attorney Bill McClure to draft guidelines before the cameras are turned on in late November.\n\nAn ALPR device photographs license plates within its vicinity. Each plate number is fed into a database, which local police use to compare with a \u201chot sheet\u201d of stolen cars or those suspected of criminal activity, Bertini said. In addition, the data is uploaded to a server at the Northern California Regional Intelligence Center, which is funded by federal, state and regional agencies including the Department of Homeland Security.\n\nSan Jose, East Palo Alto, San Francisco and Oakland are among a number of California cities where police use similar technology. Typically, the information is kept by the intelligence center for one year, but Menlo Park officials are debating whether to cut that down to six months.\n\n\u201cThe one-year period is based on the California attorney general\u2019s opinion,\u201d said Bertini, who favors the longer approach. \u201cSometimes, we have an investigation and it can take months before we get the information that would lead us to go check vehicles.\u201d\n\nMueller, however, believes one year is too long and said no one has convinced him why it\u2019s considered \u201cbest practice.\u201d\n\nHovering above Menlo Park\u2019s debate is the national conversation over the role technology plays in tracking citizens\u2019 daily activities, from how tech companies scoop up the web-surfing habits of consumers to the National Security Agency\u2019s use of vast amounts of data. At the City Council meeting last month, Cherie Zaslawsky, a Menlo Park resident, said \u201cgovernment-sponsored surveillance has a pretty grim track record.\u201c She added: \u201cOur police do a great job. Why don\u2019t [we] let them do it without spying on our everyday lives?\u201d\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union released a 34-page report this summer that cast a critical eye on the Northern California Regional Intelligence Center. \u201cLicense plate data are widely shared in California\u2019s Bay Area through [the center], although the full extent of sharing is not publicly known,\u201d the report stated.\n\nAlready, Menlo Park officers have access to license-plate information shared by police departments in other cities: more than 10 agencies in the region have signed contracts to share information through the intelligence center. Bertini said officers underwent training before being given access to the data and are aware that misuse of the information is a crime.\n\nPolice said there have been 38 shootings in Menlo Park between April 2011 and last month, the vast majority of them in or near Belle Haven. Those include three homicides and nine offenses registered as \u201cattempted murder,\u201d according to police.\n\nPlans call for installing the four fixed cameras at entry points to the community, Bertini said, with the images stored for 90 days and only police officers having access.\n\nIn a recent interview, Bostic, whose mother founded the church he now leads, cautioned that the cameras could lead to racial profiling. More than half of Belle Haven residents are African-American, while Menlo Park overall is majority white. \u201cDon\u2019t segregate and put cameras on this side and think we are going to agree with that,\u201d Bostic said.\n\nCouncil member Mueller, while voting with all of his colleagues to authorize the cameras, raised a similar caution. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s appropriate to say that it\u2019s OK to fix cameras on one neighborhood because of the crime that happened there,\u201d he said.\n\nBertini pointed out that technology can help make a community safer.\n\n\u201cWe had a homicide last year, where we had a suspect vehicle description. If we had the cameras in place, we could have gone back to check the cameras and maybe we would have been able to see the suspect vehicle or even get a license plate,\u201d he said. \u201cAlmost in every case we have a vehicle description or a suspect description.\u201d\n\nMap: Shootings in Menlo Park as registered and categorized by the police department in the last three years.
