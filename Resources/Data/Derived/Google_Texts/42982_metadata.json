(AP Photo/ Evan Vucci)\n\n4867462\n\nThe head of the agency that oversees President Barack Obama\u2019s health-care legislation suggested it should not be held responsible for the 12 Obamacare health insurance co-ops that closed their doors to customers last year, according to prepared testimony he is scheduled to deliver today before the Senate Finance Committee.\n\nAndy Slavitt, acting administrator for Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), was not apologetic in his testimony and accepted no personal responsibility for the co-op failures in 15 states, according to an advance copy of his testimony obtained by The Daily Caller News Foundation. The closures sent millions of Americans scrambling for new health insurance just in time for Christmas at the end of 2015.\n\nSlavitt defended CMS\u2019s oversight system for the co-op\u2019s by citing a July 2013 Department of Health and Human Services inspector general\u2019s report that approved CMS safeguards.\n\nHe told the senators the IG determined, \u201cCMS established a prospective oversight system to safeguard co-op funding and ensure timely implementation of the program.\u201d He did not mention the IG report had been released before the co-op program actually began offering health insurance policies in November 2013.\n\nHe also disclosed that CMS conducted site visits in 2015 for only about half of the Obamacare health co-ops, despite clear signs that a wave of financial failures were sweeping the co-op system. Slavitt blamed the defaults on other culprits: an obscure federal advisory committee, the center\u2019s giant actuarial consultant Deloitte Consulting, and congressional budget cuts that affected the co-op program.\n\nWhy Don't Liberals Take Personal Responsibility?

He did say an unspecified number face a financial condition that demanded \u201cenhanced oversight\u201d or are mandated to create a \u201ccorrective action plan.\u201d Co-ops serving Maine, Massachusetts and New Hampshire are considered in perilous financial condition and could close their doors by the end of this year.\n\nState regulators in Vermont never approved another Obamacare co-op due to a \u201cfatally flawed\u201d financial plan and the fact that the co-op arranged a sweetheart financial deal for its president.\n\nSlavitt is a former executive at United Health Group, the nation\u2019s largest health insurance company who received a rare \u201cethics waiver\u201d to join CMS. Obama nominated him to continue as the permanent CMS administrator, and he still faces a future Senate confirmation vote to keep his job.\n\nThe acting administrator told senators, \u201cit is too early to tell how much money may be recovered,\u201d of the $2.5 billion that was appropriated for 24 experimental non-profit health insurance cooperatives.\n\nThe co-op program was inserted into the Obamacare reform law to satisfy political activists who wanted a universal single payer program, an option that remains a favorite of self-described socialist and presidential candidate Bernie Sanders of Vermont. The co-op program was supposed to compete with commercial insurers.\n\nSlavitt succeeded Marilyn Tavenner, who resigned after the failure of the Obamacare launch. The way he responds to the co-op debacle could determine his confirmation prospects in front of the Senate. Slavitt told the Senate committee CMS has begun a \u201crecovery process\u201d for the failed co-ops and \u201conce the wind down of these CO-OPs is complete, we will use every available tool to recoup Federal funding.\u201d\n\nBased on CMS loan data, the total amount awarded to the failed co-ops constitutes at least $1.4 billion of the $2.5 billion allocated for the program. Slavitt revealed in his testimony that despite the financial distress sweeping through all the co-ops in 2015, CMS officials conducted site visits to only 15 states. The co-ops operate in 26 states.\n\n\u201cSince March 2015, CMS has conducted site visits of CO-OPs in 15 states,\u201d he said in his prepared testimony. He did not identify any of the states.\n\nSlavitt said some of the responsibility for the failures could be traced to an obscure federal advisory committee appointed by the Government Accountability Office that established the \u201cframework\u201d for the co-ops.\n\n\u201cThe framework for implementing the CO- OP Program was based on a report submitted by a Federal Advisory Committee appointed by the Government Accountability Office,\u201d he told the Senate committee.\n\nHe additionally pointed a finger at the CMS actuarial consultant, Deloitte Consulting. He told the Senators the application process \u201cwas rigorous, objective, and conducted with input and expertise from an independent party, Deloitte Consulting, LLP.\u201d\n\nSlavitt criticized Congress for reducing the original $6 billion appropriation to $2.5 billion. Congress shaved $2.2 billion off the program when Democrats held majorities in both the Senate and House. A second cut amounted to $3.5 billion, which came in 2012 after Senate leaders and Vice President Joe Biden negotiated a sweeping new 2012 federal budget that avoided the \u201cfiscal cliff.\u201d\n\nThe Senate passed that bill by a margin of 89\u20138, which included 49 Democrats and Sen. Sanders.\n\nInterest in the troubled co-op program is drawing the attention at other Senate committees too.\n\nYesterday, Sen. Ron Johnson , the Republican from Wisconsin who chairs the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, wrote Slavitt and demanded that CMS spell out how much money taxpayers lost in the co-op program.\n\n\u201cThe number of failed CO-OPs and the anticipation of additional closures raise concerns about how CMS will recoup the $2.4 billion it loaned to the 23 CO-OPs,\u201d Johnson, a Wisconsin Republican, told Slavitt.\n\nSenator Orrin Hatch , the Republican chairman of the finance committee said in his opening remarks that CMS \u201ccooked their books\u201d from the very beginning.\n\nThe Utah senator noted that CMS redefined the billions of dollars given to the co-ops in \u201csolvency loans\u201d as \u201cassets.\u201d Actuaries normally consider debt a liability for a company.\n\nHe said the co-ops \u201cwere doomed to fail from the outset.\u201d\n\nFollow Richard on Twitter\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
