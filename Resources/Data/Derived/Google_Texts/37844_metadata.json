John Bel Edwards by name.\n\n\u201cWe need legislators with records of success in the private sector but also representatives in government who can bring real-world experience to Washington,\u201d he said.\n\nBoustany, who co-authored legislation to gut the Affordable Care Act that was ultimately vetoed, said he continues to believe \u201cObamacare\u201d must be entirely repealed and replaced.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not aware of anything Obamacare has done right in the health care arena,\u201d he said, offering unspecific proposals of how to replace it. He called for policies that increase transparency among insurers and more flexibility for small businesses and states.\n\n\u201cThe Obamacare approach is very top down,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to unleash American innovation and let different models of delivery explain up. What works in Boston, Massachusetts, is going to be different than what works in Baton Rouge or Crowley.\u201d\n\nBoustany also decried Medicaid expansion, another opportunity made possible under the Affordable Care Act, which was long blocked under the Jindal administration.\n\nEdwards signed an executive order on his second day in office to begin the process of expanding the state-federal government program, which will extend coverage to 300,000 additional people by July.\n\nBoustany said without reform to improve Medicaid coverage and properly reimburse doctors for accepting Medicaid clients, the expansion will result in flooded emergency rooms.\n\n\u201cThis is a recipe for disaster,\u201d he said.\n\nEdwards responded in an emailed statement that states expanding Medicaid have demonstrated cost savings and improved coverage.\n\n\u201cThe results are showing that people covered under Medicaid expansion are now more likely to have a primary care doctor than they were before, more likely to get prescription drugs than they were before, and more likely to get medical care on the front end, rather than waiting for serious \u2014 and more expensive \u2014 illnesses to occur before getting medical treatment,\u201d he said. \u201cStates expanding Medicaid are also saving money, which would help us here in Louisiana in this current budget crisis as well.\u201d\n\nUnshackling small businesses from \u201coverly burdensome regulations mandated by Obamacare\u201d would spur economic activity, Boustany said.\n\nBoustany also touched on the recession-like effects that the plummeting oil prices are having on Louisiana\u2019s economy, calling for policies that match people who are losing their jobs en masse on the production and exploration side with job openings that are still available in refineries and manufacturing.\n\nAt the national level, he said the country needs to \u201cbuild out a better pipeline to establish a more efficient market within the United States\u201d while coordinating with Canada and Mexico.\n\nBoustany also touted his efforts to get new veterans clinics in Lafayette and Lake Charles as examples of being able to deliver results to Louisianians.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not afraid to go to bat for Louisiana when the chips are down,\u201d he said.\n\nBoustany also said he\u2019s looking forward to working under a new White House administration, when President Barack Obama leaves office at the end of this year. But he was mum on whether he was backing a specific candidate, only saying that he would support the Republican nominee.\n\nOn Thursday, Donald Trump will hold a presidential campaign rally at the Baton Rouge River Center. Asked specifically if he\u2019d support Trump, Boustany avoided commenting directly on the controversial candidate.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to support the Republican nominee,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s better than the alternative.\u201d\n\nBoustany already faces fierce Republican competition for the seat. So far, Congressman John Fleming, of Minden, State Treasurer John Kennedy and retired Air Force Col. Rob Manness, of Madisonville, have all announced they are running. Last week, Democrat Caroline Fayard, a New Orleans lawyer, also announced her bid.\n\nVitter announced he would not be seeking re-election after he lost the race for governor in November.\n\nFollow Rebekah Allen on Twitter, @rebekahallen.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Baton Rouge, LA /News/: Republican Congressman Charles Boustany said Monday he has the proven track record as a conservative that Louisiana voters are looking for in their next U.S. senator, to take on challenges like repealing the Affordable Care Act and growing the economy.
