(AP Photo/Eric Risberg) The Associated Press\n\nSAN FRANCISCO (AP) \u2014 A survivor of a 2008 head-on crash on the Golden Gate Bridge spoke Sunday from her wheelchair to help inaugurate a new mobile median safety barrier for the iconic San Francisco span.\n\nSan Francisco Bay Area physician Grace Dammann, paralyzed since the crash, spoke at a foggy ceremony on the bridge to express her happiness at the new barriers.\n\nThe project's chief engineer, Ewe Bauer, and U.S. Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., cut a giant red ribbon on one of the distinctive yellow trucks that will move around the 1-foot-wide safety barriers on the bridge's six lanes.\n\nWhile the dignitaries talked, work crews kept at their assignments, including painting new dividing lines on the bridge roadways.\n\nThe Golden Gate Bridge Highway and Transportation District closed the bridge to private traffic this weekend for the longest period in its seven-decade to install the safety barrier and do other work.\n\nOfficials shut the bridge to all but pedestrians, cyclists and buses starting early Saturday. Crews by Sunday already had finished installing the barriers, made of steel-clad concrete blocks, and were confident of reopening the bridge to commuters by their target of 4 a.m. Monday PDT, spokeswoman Priya David Clemens said.\n\nThe suspension bridge opened in 1937, and previously has closed only for shorter periods, including for celebrations and work projects.", "article_metadata": {"zone": "us/articles", "keyword": "Collections: US", "title": "Crash survivor inaugurates bridge safety barrier", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "SAN FRANCISCO (AP) \u2014 Golden Gate Bridge shut down to private vehicles early Saturday so workers can install a moveable median barrier designed to prevent head-on collisions, part of an effort to increase safety along the iconic structure, according to Lt.
