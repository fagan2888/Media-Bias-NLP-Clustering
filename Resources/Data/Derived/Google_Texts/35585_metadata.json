But it argues it doesn\u2019t need to pay attention to the claims because it cannot properly be given notice.\n\nBunk, responds attorney Larry Klayman of Freedom Watch, who brought the case alleging OPEC members, such as Saudi Arabia and Iran, engaged in \u201cillegal price fixing\u201d in the U.S. in violation of antitrust laws.\n\nWND reported the case alleges OPEC participated in conspiracy, price-fixing, hampering distribution and limiting production.\n\nKlayman said he had served the organization, as documented by its response, through a personally delivered notice to Frederick Luger, intake officer for OPEC in Vienna, who was given a copy of the summons and complaint.\n\nWhile a federal appeals court confirmed that was not sufficient, it did say there were ways to accomplish the service so the case could move forward and sent it back to the district court for such action.\n\nKlayman this week submitted a response to OPEC\u2019s latest arguments, contending there is no way to provide service of the lawsuit.\n\nIn a filing with the federal court, Klayman explained: \u201cThis court must not, respectfully, place the laws of Austria and other foreign policy considerations above the laws of the United States. An absurd restriction on service of process under Austrian law does not take precedent over the entirety of U.S. antitrust law. For this reason, declining to provide a means of service of process would be an abuse of discretion as it would in effect nullify U.S. antitrust law for a specific defendant, one that has engaged in price-fixing and illegal activities for too long.\u201d\n\nHe said that as long as the defendant \u201cdoes business within the United States, it is bound to obey the laws of the United States and it is the duty of this court to ensure that defendant does just that.\u201d\n\n\u201cOPEC\u2019s location outside of the United States does not shield it from liability for its illegal activities,\u201d Klayman wrote. \u201cIt is well established that U.S. antitrust laws allow for extraterritorial application and provide for the right to exercise jurisdiction over foreign conduct that affects the United States.\u201d\n\nHe noted OPEC\u2019s latest claim \u201cthat it cannot be served under any circumstances.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s no more than an attempt, Klayman said, \u201cto inoculate itself from and effectively thumb its nose at U.S. antitrust law.\u201d\n\nHe noted the appeals court decision had said service is possible, even if the process does not comply with Austrian law.\n\n\u201cPlaintiff ultimately wants no more than to simply serve defendant\u2019s United States counsel, which will prejudice no party. Defendant can present any other legal defense when they respond to the served complaint, such as by way of motion to dismiss or for summary judgment. However, at this stage of the litigation this court must simply consider the issue of service of process.\u201d\n\nThe original complaint argued that without OPEC\u2019s anti-competitive agreement, more oil would be in production, and the result would be lower prices.\n\n\u201cEven when OPEC members produce to the full extent of their capacity, they produce far less oil than they would were they operating in a competitive market, because they artificially restrict their production capacity as part of their price-fixing scheme,\u201d the complaint alleged.\n\n\u201cThe \u2026 nature of OPEC\u2019s price-fixing conduct is further confirmed by its course of dealing with non-members. OPEC has met with these non-members and has secured their agreement to limit production and has thereby increased the price of gasoline and other petroleum products over competitive levels,\u201d the complaint said..\n\nKlayman previously brought legal action against Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez and Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad on behalf of torture victims, advancing the case against Iran to the point of obtaining a default judgment.\n\nKlayman also won a nearly $2 million unpaid judgment against Cuban interests in 1996 over the shooting down of an airplane.\n\nHe also recently obtained a court ruling that the National Security Agency\u2019s spy-on-Americans programs likely violate the Constitution. And he\u2019s suing President Obama over his amnesty plans.\n\nThe claim against OPEC alleges that \u201cas a form of economic terrorism,\u201d OPEC\u2019s actions \u201care designed to severely harm the economics or strategic interests of the United States and Western Europe in particular.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe illegal conduct of the defendant, and its constituent members and co-conspirators, is thus intended at this time to also influence the American presidential and congressional elections of 2012 by destabilizing the economy to further their pro Islamic and communist agendas,\u201d the complaint said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Free Press For A Free People Since 1997", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.1", "og": {"site_name": "WND", "description": "The \u201ceconomic terrorism\u201d imposed on the world by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries is back before a federal court in Washington with an attorney seeking a court instruction on the proper way to serve OPEC with notice of the lawsuit.
