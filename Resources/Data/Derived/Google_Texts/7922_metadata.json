What is unusual here is not Amazon's relentless desire to gain margin from its suppliers, but the suppliers' growing resolve to hold the line. If other suppliers adopt the same attitude, that might have significant implications for Amazon's pell-mell growth.\n\nThe confrontations indicate that Amazon's long-stated desire to sell everything to everybody might be taking a back seat. The biggest book release in the middle of June is the new J. K. Rowling novel from Hachette; the biggest movie is \"Lego.\" Amazon is basically telling its customers to go elsewhere for them, which is a very un-Amazon thing to do.\n\nMore from The New York Times:\n\nTimeline: Bank of America and the Financial Crisis\n\nIn Tough Market, Investment Banks Seek Shelter or Get Out\n\nEndowment Chief to Exit at Harvard\n\n\n\nAmazon started refusing preorders for the Time Warner movies in mid-May. That frustrated some customers, who voiced their displeasure on its forums.\n\n\"This has got to be the most eagerly awaited 2014 movie being released so far \u2014 kids movie, adults like it too, the first good 2014 film,\" wrote one movie buff about \"Lego.\" \"Oh well, Amazon may be digging their own grave if they keep this up.\"\n\nThe retailer's page for the movies says that customers' only option is to sign up to be notified when they become available.\n\nFeds shift Obamacare data tech to Amazon\n\n\n\n\"The Lego Movie\" is not even featured in Amazon's list of forthcoming \"Kids & Family\" movies. Such lists are a big driver of preorders. The Blu-ray of \"The Lego Movie,\" due out next week, languishes at No. 18,183. The Blu-ray of \"300\" is ranked 105,389.\n\nA Warner Bros. spokesman said it was the company's \"general policy not to comment on contract terms or any other proprietary information having to do with our partners.\"\n\nAn Amazon spokesman declined to comment.", "article_metadata": {"AssetType": "partnerstory", "description": "Amazon, embroiled in a standoff with a book publisher, is using the same hardball techniques with new movies from Warner Home Video.", "news_keywords": "Amazon.com, Amazon, Warner Home Video, 'Lego' movie", "author": "David Streitfeld", "og": {"site_name": "CNBC", "description": "Amazon, embroiled in a standoff with a book publisher, is using the same hardball techniques with new movies from Warner Home Video.", "title": "Why Amazon won't let you buy the 'Lego' movie", "url": "http://www.cnbc.com/2014/06/11/amazon-stops-taking-advance-orders-for-lego-and-other-warner-videos.html", "image": "http://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2014/06/06/101737926-The_LEGO_Movie_Videogame.1910x1000.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Amazon, embroiled in a standoff with a book publisher, is using the same hardball techniques with new movies from Warner Home Video.", "title": "Amazon Stops Taking Advance Orders for \u2018Lego\u2019 and Other Warner Videos", "url": "http://www.cnbc.com/2014/06/11/amazon-stops-taking-advance-orders-for-lego-and-other-warner-videos.html", "image": {"src": "http://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2014/06/06/101737926-The_LEGO_Movie_Videogame.1910x1000.jpg"}, "site": "@CNBC", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "al": {"ios": {"app_name": "CNBC Business News and Finance", "app_store_id": 398018310}}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=398018310", "keywords": "Retail, Retail, Internet Retail, US: News, Media, Publishing, Movies and Entertainment, Amazon.com Inc, business news", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/cnbc", "published_time": "2014-06-11T06:38:59-0400", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/CNBC", "section": "Retail", "modified_time": "2014-06-11T06:39:16-0400", "tag": "Amazon.com Inc"}, "pageNodeId": 101749685, "GOOGLEBOT": "unavailable_after: 31 Dec 9999 23:59:59 GMT"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc6dc\"", "article_summary": "The Blu-ray of \"The Lego Movie,\" due out next week, languishes at No.\nAn Amazon spokesman declined to comment.\nFeds shift Obamacare data tech to Amazon\"The Lego Movie\" is not even featured in Amazon's list of forthcoming \"Kids & Family\" movies.\nThe biggest book release in the middle of June is the new J.
