He collapsed but was able to finish the match before being helped to the back.\n\nWWE immediately announced that Rollins' scheduled match with Roman Reigns will not take place at Survivor Series on Nov. 22 in Atlanta, and that he was stripped of the WWE title.\n\nA tournament to crown a new WWE champion will be held at the event and could include a final four of Reigns, Dean Ambrose, Alberto Del Rio and Kevin Owens.\n\nWith the title picture wide open, it gives WWE the possible opportunity to elevate a rising star on the roster. Most insiders, however, point to Reigns, Rollins' former championship tag-team partner, as the most likely successor to his title.\n\nJohn Cena also is on hiatus during the month of November and isn't expected back until mid-December. It can't be ruled out, however, that the 15-time world champ could be asked to come back for the tournament in order to strengthen the lineup.\n\nOrton, 35, who has had a shoulder problem for most of his career, is expected to have surgery to repair a dislocated shoulder.\n\nFrom MRI results, it was determined that Orton suffered a Bankart lesion in his shoulder, stretched ligaments and a partially torn rotator cuff.\n\n\u201cAt this point it's a matter of when he dislocates the shoulder again, and not if,\u201d said WWE doctor Steve Daquino. \u201cSurgery seems imminent, and recovery time for such a surgery would be four to six months.\u201d\n\nRollins' injury comes in the midst of a successful run on top for the former Shield member who appeared headed for a possible Wrestlemania main event next April at AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas.\n\nHe told the WWE website that he was genuinely touched by the outpouring of support from fans.\n\n\u201cWell, you know, for someone who is as universally despised as I am, I was pretty overwhelmed with the amount of love that I received from all of the fans in the WWE Universe,\u201d said Rollins. All of the well wishes and, just in general, all the concern that everyone had for me as a person and as a performer. So, I don't do this very often, but I would like to extend a thank you to them. Their support means a lot to me and it's going to go a long way in my recovery and help me mentally get back to where I was at.\u201d\n\nRollins will undergo reconstructive surgery on his knee Tuesday under Dr. James Andrews in Birmingham, Ala.\n\nWhen Rollins does return, the stage will be set for him to come back as a top babyface intent on exacting revenge against The Authority, who stripped him of his world title.\n\nBut with Wrestlemania season around the corner and ratings near an all-time low, it might to be time for WWE creative to pull a rabbit out of its collective hat.\n\nMonday Night Raw\n\nWWE's Monday Right Raw returns to the North Charleston Coliseum on Dec. 7.\n\nThe last local televised Raw, which airs live on USA network, was held June 24, 2013.\n\nTentatively scheduled for the show is an eight-man tag-team match pitting Roman Reigns, Randy Orton, Dean Ambrose and Kane against Seth Rollins and The Wyatt Family (Bray Wyatt, Luke Harper and Erick Rowan). With Orton and Rollins now sidelined, replacements could be named, or most likely the bout will become a six-man match.\n\nSeats start at $15 (plus applicable fees) and are available at the North Charleston Coliseum advance ticket office, charge by phone at 1-800-745-3000 or online at Ticketmaster.com.\n\nClash For Kids\n\nThe WNC Chapter of Toys for Tots is teaming up with Col. Tim, the owner of Florida's Coastal Wrestling Association, to put on a pro wrestling fundraiser Nov. 14 at the North Carolina National Guard Armory in Clyde.\n\nThe show features\u201cThe Beast Master\u201d Rick Link and The American GI plus a special appearance by Bobby Fulton.\n\nAll toys and money collected at the event will be used to help families in eight counties in western North Carolina. Tickets are $10, or bring a new or unopened toy valued at $10 or more and get in for $5. Doors open at 6:30 p.m. and the action starts at 7:30.\n\nFor more information, call (828) 777-2610.\n\nReach Mike Mooneyham at 843-937-5517, or follow him on Twitter at @ByMike Mooneyham and on Facebook at Facebook.com/MikeMooneyham.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "WWE scrambling as Rollins goes down with injury, Sports, \r\nSportsFP LatestNews, \r\nMike Mooneyham, \r\nMike Mooneyham, Mooneyham Column,Pro wrestling,Seth Rollins,Summer Slam,WWE", "og": {"site_name": "Post and Courier", "description": "The news only seems to get worse for WWE.", "title": "WWE scrambling as Rollins goes down with injury", "url": "http://www.postandcourier.com20151108/151109352/wwe-scrambling-as-rollins-goes-down-with-injury", "image": {"url": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20151108/PC20/151109352/AR/0/AR-151109352.jpg", "identifier": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20151108/PC20/151109352/AR/0/AR-151109352.jpg"}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The news only seems to get worse for WWE.", "title": "WWE scrambling as Rollins goes down with injury", "app": {"country": "US", "name": {"ipad": "Post and Courier", "iphone": "Post and Courier", "googleplay": "Post and Courier"}, "id": {"ipad": 603721271, "iphone": 603721271, "googleplay": "com.Synapse.PandC"}}, "site": "@hsprepzone", "image": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20151108/PC20/151109352/AR/0/AR-151109352.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "metered": "yes", "p": {"domain_verify": "c6511264bdb6fa45c6bb985fb86d3ab2"}, "fb": {"app_id": 146078808769941}, "tout": {"article": {"id": 151109352}}, "keywords": "WWE scrambling as Rollins goes down with injury , Sports, \r\nSportsFP LatestNews, \r\nMike Mooneyham, \r\nMike Mooneyham, Mooneyham Column,Pro wrestling,Seth Rollins,Summer Slam,WWE", "article": {"published_time": "2015-11-08T15:00:00Z", "modified_time": "2015-11-08T01:08:00Z", "author": "Mike Mooneyham"}, "msvalidate.01": "05BAEC9D8820FA9F10D57DB6EB3C6192", "google-site-verification": "rAW9DX7yfiFF82k05QGF6LbZBkxcKxMTzAwNv0OCKAM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "description": "The news only seems to get worse for WWE."}, "article_summary": "Most insiders, however, point to Reigns, Rollins' former championship tag-team partner, as the most likely successor to his title.\nWWE heavyweight champion Seth Rollins suffered meniscus tears during a match in Dublin, Ireland, and will be out for six to nine months.\nWWE immediately announced that Rollins' scheduled match with Roman Reigns will not take place at Survivor Series on Nov. 22 in Atlanta, and that he was stripped of the WWE title.\nWith the title picture wide open, it gives WWE the possible opportunity to elevate a rising star on the roster.\nRollins is expected to be out for six to nine months, and his title has been declared vacant."}
