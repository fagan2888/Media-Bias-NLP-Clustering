The Dachel Media Update is sponsored by Aperture International.\n\nVariety covered her on Sept 30 in Sinclair Chooses Sharyl Attkisson to Charge Into Sunday-News Arena.\n\n. . .Attkisson at times has been a controversial figure in the TV-news business. In her 2014 book, \u201cStonewalled,\u201d she suggested she could not get stories about a slow pace of early enrollment under Obamacare or about the 2012 attack on a U.S. compound in Benghazi on the air at CBS News. She has in the past also alleged the federal government hacked into her personal computer with spyware. A lawsuit regarding those allegations is still in process, she said. And while Sinclair in the past has been associated with programming that has a conservative political bent, Attkisson maintained none of these elements would affect her reporting or the way she presents her stories.\n\n\u201cThe way I view most of what I do is these are not political stories. They are oversight stories, inappropriate secrecy. These things persist from administration to administration,\u201d she said, adding: \u201cI\u2019ve always been someone who is fairly critical of government secrecy and improper government oversight, before the lawsuit. That\u2019s always a theme that won\u2019t change.\u201d\n\nHer view of TV news is that many outlets could be doing stories of greater depth, but the corporations that own them remain leery of such stuff, and the \u201cpushback campaigns\u201d they generate. Big media companies can often have alliances with political parties or politicians, not to mention advertisers, all of which puts duress on the news divisions they own. \u201cIn the good old days, which weren\u2019t that long ago, the news networks were OK with that sort of pushback and created an infrastructure that expected it and sometimes it meant you were doing a good job,\u201d she said. \u201cBut it\u2019s only fairly recently that they got squeamish.\u201d\n\nSharyl's a distinguished journalist who was not willing to compromise her principles to remain in the national news. The autism community trusts her because of her coverage of vaccine safety and the link between vaccines and the autism epidemic when no one else the mainstream press was willing to do so. She has investigated many government controversies and continues to do so.\n\nFull Measure is a frightening prospect to many who don't want to see honest coverage of controversial topics.\n\nHannah Groch-Begley at Media Matters referred to five-time Emmy Award winning Sharyl Attkisson as a \"discredited former CBS reporter\" and says her work was \"shoddy and inaccurate.\"\n\nSharyl Attkisson Got A Show After Years Of Pushing Misinformation And Conspiracies\n\nDiscredited former CBS reporter Sharyl Attkisson will host a weekly news show on Sunday mornings starting October 4 on Sinclair Broadcast Group stations, which include ABC, CBS, NBC, and Fox affiliates. Attkisson has a lengthy record of shoddy, inaccurate reporting, and she has pushed a bizarre conspiracy theory that the government hacked her home electronics.\n\nIn case anyone need a refresher course on what Sharyl has done in the past 11 years, see these stories.\n\nVaccines Don't Cause Autism, and Guns Don't Kill People\n\nQ&A with Sharyl Attkisson (C-Span)\n\nDachel Media Review: Sharyl Attkisson Resigns from CBS,\n\nSharyl Attkisson - Stonewalled\n\n\n\nAperture International provides visionary products that translate scientific breakthroughs into outstanding health benefits for our clients worldwide.
