Even more signed up through their State-based Marketplaces.\u201d\n\nLast year, 462,000 people selected plans in the first. HHS is warning people to be cautious about any year to year comparisons because the enrollment period started earlier and is longer in 2015, but enrollment is growing. People are coming back. Open enrollment is becoming a habit.\n\nThe news gets even better for Democrats as the ACA isn\u2019t just expanding access to affordable health insurance, it is also fueling a jobs boom in the health care industry. The health care industry created 44,900 new jobs in October. For the year, the health care sector has created almost as many jobs in 2015 (407,000) than they did in 2013 and 2014 combined (410,000).\n\nThe Republican response to the increase in ACA enrollment has been silence. The Republican response to the fact that the ACA has been fueling private sector job growth has been to deny reality by claiming that the ACA is killing jobs and small businesses.\n\nPresident Obama and Democrats have won. ObamaCare is not only working, but it is creating jobs and helping the economy. The question for 2016 isn\u2019t if the country should keep the ACA, but how hard are Democrats willing to fight to keep and build on what President Obama has accomplished?\n\nThe silence of Republicans speaks volumes as the success of the ACA is sweeping across the country.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The news that more people signed up for ObamaCare in the first week this year than last year combined with skyrocketing private sector job growth under the ACA has sent the Republican Party into silence.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "author": "Jason Easley", "og": {"site_name": "Politicus USA", "description": "The news that more people signed up for ObamaCare in the first week this year than last year combined with skyrocketing private sector job growth under the ACA has sent the Republican Party into silence.", "title": "Republicans Beaten Down By Facts As Job Growth And ACA Signups Skyrocket", "url": "http://www.politicususa.com/2015/11/12/republicans-beaten-facts-job-growth-aca-signups-skyrocket.html", "image": "http://15130-presscdn-0-89.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/ryan-mcconnell-sad-feat.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-11-13T10:19:49+00:00", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 523732690, "app_id": 113462415332922, "pages": 186473214703370}, "keywords": "Editors' Picks,Featured News,Issues,ACA signups skyrocket,job growth under obamacare,Obamacare,obamacare signups,politicususa,liberal,politics,sarah jones,jason easley,barack obama,hillary clinton,bernie sanders,msnbc,media", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/PoliticusUSA", "section": "Issues", "published_time": "2015-11-12T17:04:19+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-11-13T10:19:49+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "ACA signups skyrocket, job growth under obamacare, Obamacare, obamacare signups"}, "article_summary": "The Republican response to the increase in ACA enrollment has been silence.\nFor the year, the health care sector has created almost as many jobs in 2015 (407,000) than they did in 2013 and 2014 combined (410,000).\nOpen enrollment is becoming a habit.\nThe silence of Republicans speaks volumes as the success of the ACA is sweeping across the country.\nThe Republican response to the fact that the ACA has been fueling private sector job growth has been to deny reality by claiming that the ACA is killing jobs and small businesses."}
