We found Radioactive material from Mosul university,\u201d the same Twitter user Muslim al-Britani wrote. \u201cWe\u2019ll find out what dirty bombs are and what they do. We\u2019ll also discuss what might happen if one actually went off in a public area.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cThis sort of bomb would be terribly destructive if went off in LONDON becuz it would be more of a disruptive than a destructive weapon.\u201d\n\nIraq informed the U.N. in July about the missing uranium and warned about this very situation.\n\n\u201cTerrorist groups have seized control of nuclear material at the sites that came out of the control of the state,\" Iraq\u2019s U.N. ambassador wrote in a letter to U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon. \u201cThese nuclear materials, despite the limited amounts mentioned, can enable terrorist groups, with the availability of the required expertise, to use it separate or in combination with other materials in its terrorist acts.\u201d\n\nIn light of the recent claims, Rubin said Western nations need to be prepared\u2014whether or not Britani\u2019s claims are true.\n\n\u201cMaybe Britani is lying, and maybe he\u2019s not. But Western officials would be foolish to assume that just because something hasn\u2019t happened yet, it won\u2019t,\u201d Rubin told the Free Beacon. \u201cThe terrorist groups have the motivation and, thanks to post-withdrawal vacuum created in Iraq, the means to strike the West like never before.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Whether or not the claims are true, this needs to be taken seriously. .05/26/2016 20:03:09PM EST.", "author": "Leah Barkoukis", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Whether or not the claims are true, this needs to be taken seriously.", "title": "Leah Barkoukis - The Islamic State Claims to Have 'Radioactive Device' in Europe", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/leahbarkoukis/2014/12/09/the-islamic-state-claims-to-have-radioactive-device-in-europe-n1929494", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2014/307/2823d99b-152d-4859-be9e-282a57d9f275.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "Whether or not the claims are true, this needs to be taken seriously.", "title": "Leah Barkoukis - The Islamic State Claims to Have 'Radioactive Device' in Europe", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/leahbarkoukis/2014/12/09/the-islamic-state-claims-to-have-radioactive-device-in-europe-n1929494", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2014/307/2823d99b-152d-4859-be9e-282a57d9f275.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "The Islamic State Claims to Have 'Radioactive Device' in Europe, Leah Barkoukis, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "\u201cO by the way Islamic State does have a Dirty bomb.\n\u201cThe terrorist groups have the motivation and, thanks to post-withdrawal vacuum created in Iraq, the means to strike the West like never before.\u201d\nWe found Radioactive material from Mosul university,\u201d the same Twitter user Muslim al-Britani wrote.\n\u201cTerrorist groups have seized control of nuclear material at the sites that came out of the control of the state,\" Iraq\u2019s U.N. ambassador wrote in a letter to U.N.
