Nonetheless, lawmakers show no signs of letting up, opting to continue enacting a complicated web of laws related to the medical procedure. This legislative session, Louisiana has exemplified that strategy, advancing several different attacks on reproductive rights at the same time. Here\u2019s what the lawmakers in the Pelican State have been spending their time on:\n\n1. Passing a bill to shut down abortion clinics and turn doctors into criminals.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Louisiana legislature gave final approval to House Bill 388, a piece of legislation that will require abortion providers to obtain admitting privileges from local hospitals. That unnecessary requirement, which is directly modeled on a new law in Texas that\u2019s forcing dozens of clinics to close, is specifically intended to compromise women\u2019s access to legal abortion services. In addition to shutting down at least three of the state\u2019s five existing clinics, HB 388 threatens to turn private physicians into criminals by limiting the number of abortions they\u2019re allowed to perform before needing to be officially classified as an \u201cabortion provider\u201d \u2014 a designation that isn\u2019t exactly attractive to medical professionals, considering all of the other restrictions on providers included in the new legislation.\n\n2. Trying to force comatose pregnant women to remain on life support against their families\u2019 wishes.\n\nLouisiana lawmakers are currently advancing House Bill 1274, a measure that would make it harder to take incapacitated pregnant women off of life support, even if that\u2019s what their loved ones want to do. Critics have decried the legislation as essentially forcing women\u2019s bodies to be used as incubators. The measure was spurred by a recent controversy in Texas in which a brain-dead pregnant woman\u2019s family sued to take her off life support after a hospital there forced her to remain hooked up to machines against their wishes. The lawmaker who introduced the measure, Rep. Austin Badon (D), claims that it will protect the sanctity of life because \u201cwe have a responsibility to that unborn child, to give that unborn child a chance.\u201d\n\n3. Asking women to read a pamphlet about \u201cabortion risks\u201d written by abortion opponents.\n\nUnder House Bill 1262 \u2014 which has already passed the House and is awaiting action in the Senate \u2014 a woman would be required to read a pamphlet containing biased information about the mental health risks of abortion before being allowed to continue with the procedure. Even though research has proven that abortion is not actually linked to mental health issues, Rep. Barry Ivey (R) claims that his bill is necessary in light of the \u201cpotential psychiatric issues\u201d that can result from ending a pregnancy. HB 1262 stipulates that the pamphlet will be created by a 14-member task force that includes state lawmakers, psychologists, and \u201ccrisis pregnancy center\u201d employees who counsel women against having abortions.\n\n4. Defeating attempts to improve the state\u2019s dismal sex ed laws.\n\nEven though Louisiana\u2019s lack of adequate sex ed requirements has been directly tied to endemic rates of HIV infection among African American youth, and one lawmaker referred to the failure to provide kids with accurate medical information as a \u201cform of child abuse,\u201d the legislature recently defeated two different measures that would have improved the state\u2019s sexual health classes. Lawmakers killed an effort to mandate comprehensive sex ed in public schools \u2014 marking the third time in the past five years that particular measure has been voted down. They also defeated a bill that would have surveyed public school students about their sexual activity in an attempt to develop better public health programs.\n\n5. Working on banning Planned Parenthood from providing sex ed materials in public schools.\n\nLawmakers may not be willing to vote for measures that would improve sex ed, but they\u2019re happy to advance legislation to move in the opposite direction. Accusing Planned Parenthood employees of using sex ed materials as a scheme to sell more abortions, the legislature is considering a measure that would bar abortion providers from providing any information about sexual health in public schools. In reality, Planned Parenthood is the biggest sex ed provider in the country, and has a long history of providing these type of health resources to teens. Nonetheless, House Bill 305 would effectively reinforce the stigma surrounding abortion, suggesting that every employee connected with an abortion provider must be morally corrupt.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "Louisiana is working to shut down abortion clinics, resist sex ed, go after Planned Parenthood, and undermine pregnant women's bodily autonomy.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "Louisiana is working to shut down abortion clinics, resist sex ed, go after Planned Parenthood, and undermine pregnant women's bodily autonomy.", "title": "Louisiana\u2019s War On Women: The 5 Worst Attacks On Reproductive Rights Launched This Year", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/health/2014/05/22/3440497/louisiana-war-women/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/shutterstock_102526367.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Louisiana is working to shut down abortion clinics, resist sex ed, go after Planned Parenthood, and undermine pregnant women's bodily autonomy.", "title": "Louisiana\u2019s War On Women: The 5 Worst Attacks On Reproductive Rights Launched This Year", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/shutterstock_102526367-321x214.jpg", "creator": "@Tara_CR", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-health", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/shutterstock_102526367.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/shutterstock_102526367.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2014-05-22T11:01:14+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/tculpressler"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca696\"", "article_summary": "Health Louisiana\u2019s War On Women: The 5 Worst Attacks On Reproductive Rights Launched This Year CREDIT: ShutterstockThe last several years have brought a record-breaking number of abortion restrictions on the state level.\nThis legislative session, Louisiana has exemplified that strategy, advancing several different attacks on reproductive rights at the same time.\nNonetheless, House Bill 305 would effectively reinforce the stigma surrounding abortion, suggesting that every employee connected with an abortion provider must be morally corrupt.\nDefeating attempts to improve the state\u2019s dismal sex ed laws.\nWorking on banning Planned Parenthood from providing sex ed materials in public schools."}
