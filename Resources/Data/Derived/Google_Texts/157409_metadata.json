(AP) \u2013 A former state technology manager involved in building the software behind Oregon\u2019s troubled health insurance exchange notified the state Monday that she may file a lawsuit for defamation and wrongful termination.\n\nCarolyn Lawson, the former chief information for the Oregon Health Authority, alleges that she was asked to resign in December because she objected to making public statements she deemed false. Her claim says managers at the Health Authority and the insurance exchange, known as Cover Oregon, \u201cprivately threatened and publicly scapegoated\u201d her.\n\nOregon is the only state that still doesn\u2019t have an online capability allowing the general public to quickly enroll in insurance under the new federal health care law. Lawson and her staff were responsible for overseeing the early technology development for Cover Oregon.\n\nThe failures have created tremendous political pressure for Gov. John Kitzhaber, who championed the exchange, and state legislators who overwhelmingly backed it.\n\nLawson\u2019s lawyer, David Angeli of Portland, alleges that OHA and Cover Oregon officials \u201cresponded to the criticism by organizing, encouraging, allowing, tolerating and/or engaging in a substantial cover-up\u201d in order to protect certain people and point the finger at Lawson and others.\n\nAngeli filed a tort claim notice with the Department of Administrative Services, a required precursor to an eventual lawsuit. He claims the state\u2019s actions amount to defamation, intentional infliction of emotional distress, wrongful termination and a violation of Oregon\u2019s whistleblower protections.\n\nThe claim names the Oregon Health Authority, Cover Oregon and senior officials at each: Tina Edlund, interim director of OHA, and Patty Wentz, the communications director; as well as Bruce Goldberg, interim director of Cover Oregon and Rocky King, the former director.\n\nKarynn Fish, a spokeswoman for the Oregon Health Authority, and Amy Fauver, Cover Oregon\u2019s chief communications officer, both declined to comment.\n\nResponsibility for the project lied with Lawson\u2019s technology team until May 2013, when a federal grant ran out unexpectedly early and Cover Oregon took over. Internal documents released under Oregon\u2019s public records law showed that Cover Oregon officials believed they received substandard code when they took on full responsibility for the project.\n\nLawson disputes that narrative. Her claim says Cover Oregon officials were deeply involved as early as June of 2012 and deserve a large share of the blame.\n\n\u201cCover Oregon\u2019s inability to articulate clear business requirements, establish any clear scope for the project, or provide effective leadership rank high among the easily provable reasons why the project failed.\u201d\n\nLawson alleges Wentz told her it was part of her job to deliver \u201ctalking points\u201d that Lawson believed were \u201cmisleading and/or not entirely truthful.\u201d\n\nShe alleges that Wentz told her: \u201cSomebody has to be held to blame for this \u2013 it\u2019s going to be Rocky (King), or it\u2019s going to be Oracle, or it\u2019s going to be you. We want it to be Oracle, but it can be you if you want.\u201d The claim says Lawson viewed that statement as a threat.\n\nOracle was the project\u2019s chief contractor and has billed $160 million to date. King went on medical leave and later stepped down as Cover Oregon\u2019s chief.\n\nCopyright 2014 The Associated Press.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Carolyn Lawson, the former chief information officer for the Oregon Health Authority, says managers at the Health Authority and the insurance exchange, known as Cover Oregon, \"privately threatened and publicly scapegoated\" her.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"url": "http://sacramento.cbslocal.com/2014/03/18/former-official-involved-with-cover-oregon-may-sue-for-defamation/", "image": {"width": 652, "secure_url": "https://cbssacramento.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/cover-oregon.jpg?w=652", "identifier": "https://cbssacramento.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/cover-oregon.jpg?w=652", "height": 325}, "type": "article", "description": "Carolyn Lawson, the former chief information officer for the Oregon Health Authority, says managers at the Health Authority and the insurance exchange, known as Cover Oregon, \"privately threatened and publicly scapegoated\" her.", "title": "Former Official Involved With Cover Oregon May Sue For Defamation"}, "twitter": {"image": "https://cbssacramento.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/cover-oregon.jpg?w=652", "description": "Carolyn Lawson, the former chief information officer for the Oregon Health Authority, says managers at the Health Authority and the insurance exchange, known as Cover Oregon, \"privately threatened and publicly scapegoated\" her.", "site": "/social/", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Former Official Involved With Cover Oregon May Sue For Defamation"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "News, Sports, Weather, Traffic and the Best of Sacramento", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "application-name": "CBS Sacramento", "article": {"publisher": "http://sacramento.cbslocal.com/social/", "author": "http://sacramento.cbslocal.com/social/"}, "keywords": "affordable care act news, national, affordable care act, cover oregon", "google-site-verification": "44caXBf4kjHeKKAT7ZZ89NaCX25utL_yRSa-qGpwIhY", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://sacramento.cbslocal.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/1e592dab1a834e9f02fdb648f19487a6?s=16", "news_keywords": "affordable care act, cover oregon"}, "article_summary": "Her claim says Cover Oregon officials were deeply involved as early as June of 2012 and deserve a large share of the blame.\nKarynn Fish, a spokeswoman for the Oregon Health Authority, and Amy Fauver, Cover Oregon\u2019s chief communications officer, both declined to comment.\nHer claim says managers at the Health Authority and the insurance exchange, known as Cover Oregon, \u201cprivately threatened and publicly scapegoated\u201d her.\nResponsibility for the project lied with Lawson\u2019s technology team until May 2013, when a federal grant ran out unexpectedly early and Cover Oregon took over.\nThe claim names the Oregon Health Authority, Cover Oregon and senior officials at each: Tina Edlund, interim director of OHA, and Patty Wentz, the communications director; as well as Bruce Goldberg, interim director of Cover Oregon and Rocky King, the former director."}
