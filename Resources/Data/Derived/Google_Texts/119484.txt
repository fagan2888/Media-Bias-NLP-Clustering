Aberdeen, SD

A man whose journey KELOLAND News has followed since 2014 has come to an end.

A Facebook post shared by KELO's Erich Schaffhauser says former Aberdeen firefighter Matt Cler passed away Saturday afternoon after a years-long battle with Fibrolamellar Hepatocellular Carcinoma, a rare form of cancer.

He spoke with KELOLAND News about the importance of donating blood and staying positive despite his situation.

"You can't just sit around and cry about it," Cler told KELOLAND News in December 2014. "You're not going to get anywhere; you're not going to make any progress, and it's always good just to stay optimistic about things."
