A group of about 100 protestors picketed on the Matanzas Pass Bridge to Fort Myers Beach on Saturday, demanding leaders do something about water quality in Southwest Florida.

John Heim, with the Southwest Florida Clean Water Movement, led the protest and said he's appalled by the water and wants leaders to educate the public on what's going on and how they're being affected.

"People here today realize that we're 100 percent tourism-based as a community and an economy, and they're up here basically voicing their opinions and fighting for their lives, quite honestly. They know without clean water, we'll lose our billion dollar tourism industry," Heim said.

Representatives with Southwest Florida Clean Water Movement said they plan to take legal action if nothing is done soon to stop the releases.
