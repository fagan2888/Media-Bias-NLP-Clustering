One student told him, \"this is not part of your First Amendment right.\"\n\nBut the students weren't the only ones with a faulty grasp of what the First Amendment entails. A campus police officer initially told the preacher that he could continue to speak about his views only if he put away the sign and refrained from making incendiary statements comparing abortion to the Holocaust.\n\n\"What I'm here to tell you is that on campus we have additional rules other than just freedom of speech,\" the officer told the preacher. When pressed, the officer maintained that university administrative ordinances prohibited offensive and demeaning public expressions.\n\nObviously, the cop was wrong\u2014something that a second officer realized immediately after appearing on the scene. This cop, a sergeant, demonstrated a much stronger awareness of the law. He calmly put the other officer in his place, stating, \"My only concern is that there is no physical violence. If everybody is going to stay and yell and scream, that's fine. As long as there's no violence, we're done.\"\n\nLater, a mob of students approached the preacher and damaged his sign.\n\nThe frightening and frustrating exchange was captured on video. According to The Daily Emerald:\n\nHistory major Allison Rutledge was the first to damage the anti-abortion activist\u2019s poster. She stood on it and claimed that the activist didn\u2019t have a right to display the graphic imagery. The video doesn\u2019t make it clear when the anti-abortion activist\u2019s sign ends up on the ground (it cuts before the action happens). \u201cThis is my property,\u201d the activist said as Rutledge stood on his sign. \u201cJust leave us alone.\u201d The video cuts after a while, but Rutledge is later seen leading a chant in order to get the anti-abortion activist to leave University of Oregon property. \u201cAll I\u2019d like to say about why I decided to actually take the sign from him is I realized it was his property, but it was a piece of paper. I considered the sign obscene and offensive and intending to anger and start a scene,\u201d Rutledge said when contacted for comment. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to look at that obscenity.\u201d She called the incident a tussle before saying that she felt emotionally threatened by the anti-abortion activist\u2019s sign. \u201cThere\u2019s a limit to what people should be forced to look at,\u201d Rutledge said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t like it and we actually made him put his sign away. We had no problem with his opinion, but it was his sign. You can\u2019t just show whatever you want.\u201d\n\nThis is a sentiment one encounters often on public university campuses: You can't just show/say/think whatever you want. There's just one problem with it: it's wrong in a very precise legal sense. People have an explicit, Court-recognized right to engage in very offensive and disturbing speech on public property. Even if that speech is \"triggering\" (a claim made by the student-protesters, who wanted to shield others from the emotional harm of seeing the sign). Even if that speech is deeply racist and contemptible, as it was on the SAE bus at the University of Oklahoma.\n\nSomething to note: As Reason's Stephanie Slade and Katherine Mangu-Ward have both pointed out, people who would like to live in a world with stricter parameters on acceptable speech should actually be in favor of more privatization and fewer government-run or government-owned spheres of influence. The First Amendment prevents public institutions from taking punitive actions against people for possessing abhorrent views. If students want to live on a campus where offensive speech can result in institutional punishment, they should check out those greedy, profit-driven (or religiously-motivated) private colleges\u2014and demand more of them.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "'What I'm here to tell you is that on campus we have additional rules other than just freedom of speech,' said the cop.", "title": "Students Attack 'Triggering' Anti-Abortion Sign, Cop Says Free Speech Has Limits on Campus", "url": "http://reason.com/blog/2015/03/13/students-attack-triggering-anti-abortion", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14262567252321.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "'What I'm here to tell you is that on campus we have additional rules other than just freedom of speech,' said the cop.", "title": "Students Attack 'Triggering' Anti-Abortion Sign, Cop Says Free Speech Has Limits on Campus", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14262567252321.jpg", "creator": "@robbysoave", "site": "@reason", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 17548474116}, "article": {"tag": "HomePage", "published_time": "2015-03-13T15:35:00+00:00", "author": "http://reason.com/people/robby-soave"}, "msvalidate.01": "212A68A07785B3080038A845C4EE8905", "google-site-verification": "-AmMiilAN-pnjWt369CUWae-VQ-b9wmH4fSGyhbkQxw", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcdc22\"", "article_summary": "People have an explicit, Court-recognized right to engage in very offensive and disturbing speech on public property.\nStudents at the University of Oregon clashed with an adult anti-abortion preacher earlier this week, eventually grabbing his graphic sign, tearing it, and stomping on it.\nYou can\u2019t just show whatever you want.\u201dThis is a sentiment one encounters often on public university campuses: You can't just show/say/think whatever you want.\n\"What I'm here to tell you is that on campus we have additional rules other than just freedom of speech,\" the officer told the preacher.\nThe video doesn\u2019t make it clear when the anti-abortion activist\u2019s sign ends up on the ground (it cuts before the action happens)."}
