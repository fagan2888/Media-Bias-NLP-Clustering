These reminders frequently come as Walker seeks to distinguish himself from political opponents in Wisconsin\u2014the ones, he claims, who\u2019ve sent his family death threats and harassed his kids on Facebook; the \u201cliterally thousands of protesters outside our family home\u201d in Wauwatosa. Some of these protesters have, according to Walker, driven past the house and given him the finger as he and his family raked leaves on a Sunday afternoon after church and before the Packers game.\n\nSpeaking in 2012 to a teleconference with activists from Ralph Reed\u2019s Faith and Freedom Coalition, Walker said his faith has enabled him to rise above the \u201cvitriol, and the constant, ongoing hatred\u201d during the recall election he faced in the wake of his anti-union legislation, which has crippled the state\u2019s once-iconic labor movement. Along with the unmistakable contrast of his church-going family with the profane and progressive activists, Walker cited two Bible verses. He didn\u2019t recite them, but for anyone who knows their Bible\u2014as Walker, the son of a Baptist pastor, does\u2014the meaning was clear. The verses that helped him withstand the hatred were Romans 16:20 (\u201cThe God of peace will soon crush Satan under your feet. The grace of our Lord Jesus be with you\u201d) and Isaiah 54:17 (\u201cno weapon forged against you will prevail, and you will refute every tongue that accuses you.\u201d)\n\nShould he run for president, Walker may very well turn out to be the 2016 cycle\u2019s evangelical favorite\u2014not because he ticks off a laundry list of culture war talking points, pledges fealty to a \u201cChristian nation,\u201d or because he\u2019s made a show of praying publicly to curry political favor. Although by no means universal, some conservative evangelicals\u2014those who eschew the fever swamps of talk radio, yet share the same political stances of the religious right\u2014are weary of the old style of campaigning. They\u2019re turned off by the culture war red meat, the dutiful but insincere orations of piety.\n\nEmphasizing that ours is a \u201cChristian nation\u201d and pushing \u201chot button issues\u201d as a style of campaigning has been detrimental to evangelicals, said Mary Jo Sharp, who teaches apologetics at Houston Baptist University and analyzes political campaigns as part of a class she teaches there. \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to hear\u201d that kind of rhetoric, she said. \u201cChristians are not supposed to be the dividers.\u201d\n\nOver the course of his political career in Wisconsin, Walker \u201chasn\u2019t presented as any kind of culture warrior,\u201d said Hunter Baker, Associate Professor of Political Science at Union University, a Southern Baptist school in Jackson, Tennessee. \u201cOne of the worst things that ever happened with conservative Christians,\u201d said Baker, was that they \u201cgive in to a tribal impulse,\u201d by questioning \u201care we getting the respect we perceive we once had, are we losing ground, we need to mobilize, we need to increase our force.\u201d That, he added, \u201cis a losing strategy. It gives people the sense you\u2019re working from resentment.\u201d\n\nIn an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal last month, Russell Moore, president of the Southern Baptist Convention\u2019s Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission, wrote that in 2016 evangelicals won\u2019t be looking to candidates to \u201cknow the words to hymns,\u201d \u201crepeat clich\u00e9s about appointing Supreme Court justices who will \u2018interpret the law, not make the law,\u2019\u201d or to use \u201c\u2018God and country\u2019 talk borrowed from a 1980s-era television evangelist.\u201d\n\nMoore \u201chas a good feel of the pulse of evangelicals\u201d and \u201crepresents a wide segment\u201d of them, said Tobin Grant, a political scientist at Southern Illinois University and blogger on religion and politics for Religion News Service. Unlike his predecessor, Richard Land, known for inflaming the culture wars, Moore\u2019s \u201cfocus is more on religious and social concerns than directly political ones\u201d and has \u201cless interest in changing DC and more interest in keeping DC out of the way of the church,\u201d Grant said.\n\nThese evangelicals are listening for a candidate who can signal he is \u201cone of us\u201d without pandering. Both evangelical and Catholic candidates who have earned the culture warrior label for their strident pronouncements\u2014Ted Cruz, Rick Santorum, or Mike Huckabee\u2014are seen as embarrassing embodiments of stereotypes these conservative Christians would like to shed.\n\nInstead, they are looking at a candidate like Walker, or even Jeb Bush (a Catholic), who is personally religious and, crucially, \u201cgets\u201d evangelical culture. Bush\u2019s Right to Rise PAC recently signed Jordan Sekulow, executive director of the American Center for Law and Justice, as a senior advisor\u2014a move the Christian Broadcasting Network\u2019s David Brody called the move \u201ca big get\u201d for courting the evangelical vote. While Sekulow has been at the forefront of the culture wars, the ACLJ is also one of several religious right legal firms who, for example, brought legal challenges to the Affordable Care Act\u2019s contraception coverage requirement.\n\nWalker hits the right evangelical notes without overplaying his hand\u2014and that\u2019s exactly the way they want him to keep it. John Mark Reynolds, professor of philosophy and provost at Houston Baptist University, said that Walker \u201cwould do well to do nothing to appeal to us. We get it. He\u2019s one of us. He sounds like one of us. He leans forward like one of us. He answers questions like one of us.\u201d\n\nEvangelicals, said Reynolds, \u201cwill fall out of their chairs to vote for someone who would defend them in their cultural belonging but doesn\u2019t embarrass them intellectually.\u201d\n\nFor decades, the Republican presidential primaries have been marked by a now-predictable pattern: the candidates scramble over one another to present themselves as the most trusted ideologue, the most \u201cauthentic\u201d Christian. In both 2008 and 2012, white evangelicals made up 26 percent of the electorate, according to exit polling data, and they overwhelmingly voted Republican. In 2012, 78 percent of them voted for Mitt Romney, while in 2008, 74 percent voted for John McCain. In two of the first three primary contests, they make up a majority of Republicans\u201456 percent of Iowa caucus-goers and 64 percent of South Carolina GOP primary voters in 2012.\n\nAs a result, despite no single figure emerging as the universal evangelical favorite in either primary election, the candidates competed to maximize their share of this crucial bloc. They tallied up endorsements from prominent pastors and religious figures and strained to be the candidate most vociferously opposed to abortion, same-sex marriage, and even, in 2012, contraception. They gave speeches at churches and evangelical universities and submitted to interviews by televangelists. To the extent that he fell short of those expectations, John McCain\u2019s 2008 selection of Sarah Palin as his running mate served to assuage evangelical doubts.\n\nIn 2011, former Texas governor Rick Perry\u2019s first campaign move was to host a massive prayer rally, The Response, in Houston\u2019s Reliant Stadium, bankrolled by the sine qua non of the culture wars, the American Family Association. This year, Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal replicated that strategy\u2014even though for Perry it apparently reaped no real electoral benefits. For Huckabee, who may well reprise his 2008 run in 2016, it meant bringing a preacher\u2019s style to the campaign trail, which he then parlayed into a lucrative deal with Fox News. In 2004, it meant preachers crisscrossing swing states like Ohio, campaigning simultaneously for George W. Bush\u2019s reelection and the state\u2019s ban on same-sex marriage.\n\nBut just three election cycles later, opposing same-sex marriage, particularly portraying it as catastrophic to the maintenance of \u201cChristian values,\u201d clashes profoundly with rapid and unprecedented changes in the law and cultural attitudes. Facing what many on both sides believe to be an inevitable Supreme Court decision invalidating those bans, the Republican presidential candidates are unlikely to talk about same-sex marriage directly. Ben Carson\u2019s hasty apology for his claim that homosexuality is a choice (proven, he claimed, because people go into prison straight and come out gay) is just one sign that the campaign rhetoric on this issue will be subject to a new kind of scrutiny.\n\nInstead of talking about opposition to marriage equality, evangelical activists say, religious freedom has become the new defining mantra. Unlike marriage equality, on which white evangelicals, particularly Millennials, are divided, religious freedom unifies them like no other issue but abortion.\n\n\u201cWhat will matter to evangelicals,\u201d Moore wrote in his Wall Street Journal op-ed, \u201cis how the candidate, if elected president, will articulate and defend religious-liberty rights.\u201d\n\nThe religious liberty issue is, for evangelicals, a \u201cfour-alarm fire,\u201d said Denny Burk, Professor of Biblical Studies at Boyce College, part of the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary in Louisville, Kentucky. He said evangelicals expect the candidates \u201cto have the courage of their convictions to persuade people about what\u2019s going on.\u201d\n\nFrom the Hobby Lobby litigation to cases involving florists, bakers, and photographers refusing to provide services for same-sex ceremonies, the issue has been percolating in the evangelical community for years. In recent weeks, conservative Christians have talked and written prolifically about Barronelle Stutzman, a Washington state florist found liable under the state\u2019s anti-discrimination laws for refusing to provide flowers for a long-time gay customer\u2019s wedding, and Kelvin Cochran, the Atlanta fire chief fired after revelations about anti-gay comments he wrote in a book.\n\nCongressional Republicans are listening, too; they have introduced the Child Welfare Provider Inclusion Act, which would exempt faith-based providers from having to place children for foster care or adoption with same-sex couples if that conflicts with \u201ctheir sincerely held religious beliefs or moral convictions.\u201d\n\nGiven the level of division over these issues, it\u2019s not clear that voters who aren\u2019t conservative Christians would view the change in emphasis as a tamping down of the culture wars. Legal exemptions to permit florists, caterers, social service providers, or other businesses to refuse service to LGBT people are hotly contested, both in legal circles and in the court of public opinion. In another context, the Hobby Lobby litigation, in which the Supreme Court ruled that the contraception coverage requirement under the Affordable Care Act violated a closely-held corporation\u2019s rights under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, was one of the most scrutinized and debated religious freedom cases in recent memory.\n\nEvangelicals insist that they don\u2019t want special treatment in these instances; they just want \u201cto be left alone,\u201d said Reynolds. The government should \u201clet people live their private lives, including their businesses, and let the market determine whether they survive.\u201d (Reynolds noted, however, that he is opposed to proposed state laws, championed by many religious right advocacy groups, to permit businesses to refuse service to LGBT people based on religious objections, saying such laws would be \u201coverreaching.\u201d)\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want tropes or identity politics or blowing the dog whistle and hoping everyone gathers around,\u201d said Burk. \u201cI want to see a real vision for carrying this out.\u201d That vision, said Burk, should include pledges about judicial nominees and promises not to appoint cabinet officials who will put \u201cany person of faith, not just Christians, in a position that\u2019s going to compromise their conscience.\u201d\n\n\u201cSimply throwing out some family values rhetoric won\u2019t be sufficient,\u201d said Brian Mattson, a theologian and a principal at Dead Reckoning TV, a digital outlet that provides programming aimed at Millennials from a \u201cdistinctly Christian worldview.\u201d Instead, he said, the Republican conversation about religious freedom should be (and, he predicted, will be) \u201cmore substantive\u201d about the Free Exercise Clause, the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, and other laws and policies.\n\nBut not all evangelicals are convinced by Moore\u2019s call for a different sort of rhetoric. Moore, said Keith Miller, an attorney who works for Hillsdale College and contributes to the evangelical blog Mere Orthodoxy, \u201cspeaks for a good number of evangelicals who do want a new tone.\u201d But, he added, \u201cI don\u2019t really think that despite the endless stories to this effect, I don\u2019t think the evangelical bloc, to the extent it is a bloc, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s changed that much.\u201d\n\nEvangelicals likewise remain divided on immigration. While some evangelical leaders have advocated for immigration reform, including a path to citizenship, Miller said, \u201cthe evangelical on the street is closer to Rush Limbaugh on immigration.\u201d While Perry\u2019s record on immigration hurt him in 2012, his \u201coops\u201d moment was probably more defining. And even though some evangelicals favor reform, they think it is unlikely that either Bush or Marco Rubio\u2014both of whom have supported reform in the past\u2014would make it a centerpiece of any campaign.\n\nAs for the other candidates, Chris Christie, even to conservatives, came across badly after \u201cBridgegate\u201d; Reynolds described Christie as a \u201cnarcissist\u201d who is \u201ctemperamentally unsuited to be in the White House.\u201d Huckabee, said Reynolds, \u201cembarrasses evangelicals by fitting cultural stereotypes.\u201d Ben Carson is well-known through his 1996 book, popular with evangelicals, Gifted Hands, but is, said Reynolds, \u201crunning on the Newt Gingrich plan that this is really good for my career.\u201d While Rand Paul\u2019s libertarianism is appealing to some evangelicals, they said, his historic position on Israel is a dealbreaker while Ted Cruz, said Reynolds, is \u201cacerbic\u201d and \u201cnot a nice person.\u201d\n\nCruz, like Walker, is the son of a Baptist pastor, but not all evangelicals admire his speaking style or cultural cues in the same way. \u201cI\u2019m not impressed\u201d with Cruz, said Mattson, adding that he speaks in a way that is \u201cdecidedly phony to me.\u201d\n\nIn contrast, Walker speaks the right language, \u201cbut not in a polarizing way,\u201d said Mattson. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t sound pandering like a Huckabee and doesn\u2019t come across as strident and divisive like Santorum. He\u2019s winsome.\u201d\n\nStill, though, Walker does play a good-versus-evil hand. At last month\u2019s Conservative Political Action Conference, he drew criticism from both liberals and conservatives for comparing protestors to the Islamic State, saying \u201cIf I can take on 100,000 protesters, I can do the same across the globe,\u201d a comment that could be seen as a salvo in Walker\u2019s own brand of culture war (though he later said he didn\u2019t mean to conflate the two).\n\nWithout calling much attention to it, Walker assures evangelicals that he emerges from the same subculture and speaks their language. After CPAC, Walker spoke at the National Religious Broadcasters Convention, where he reportedly talked about how to discern whether God is calling him to a presidential run.\n\nFor Reynolds, Walker speaks \u201cin a biblical cadence\u201d and uses \u201cbiblical expressions,\u201d sending cues that others in a \u201cbiblically illiterate society\u201d might not pick up on. Although of course no one is making early predictions, Reynolds said, \u201cI could see Scott Walker pulling this off.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Religion Dispatches", "description": "When speaking to religious audiences, Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker likes to remind people that he goes to church and knows his Bible.
