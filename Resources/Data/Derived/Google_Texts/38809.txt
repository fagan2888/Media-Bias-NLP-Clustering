Gov. Sam Brownback is trying to reorganize the licensing of foster care homes and the state workers who determine whether people are eligible for Medicaid.

Brownback issued an executive order last week to move foster home licensing to the state Department for Children and Families from the Department of Health and Environment, as of July.

DCF already oversees child welfare services.

The order also moves the Medicaid eligibility workers from DCF to KDHE in January 2016.

The health department oversees the Medicaid program that provides health coverage to the poor and disabled.

The governor must allow legislators to consider the order, but if neither the House nor the Senate rejects it by mid-March, it will take effect.

Brownback says the reorganization will streamline the administration of both programs.
