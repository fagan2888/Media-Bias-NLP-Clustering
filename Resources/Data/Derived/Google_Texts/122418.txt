LAKELAND, Fla. (AP) - A Publix employee in central Florida is celebrating his 50th year working for the grocery store chain.

Larry Delaney is something of a rarity at Publix. In the company’s 83-year history, only 16 employees have reached the 50-year milestone.

The Ledger reports (http://bit.ly/1n2MY1S ) that Delaney’s achievement was marked Friday with congratulatory signs and a surprise party with family and colleagues at the Lakeland warehouse where he works.

Delaney is a retail improvement specialist. His first job was as a produce clerk at a Publix in Fort Myers in April 1964.

Delaney has the third-longest tenure among active Publix employees. Another Lakeland colleague celebrated his 50th anniversary in August, and a Jacksonville produce clerk has spent 53 years with the company.

Publix officials lauded Delaney’s energy and passion for his work.
