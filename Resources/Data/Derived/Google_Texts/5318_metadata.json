Photo courtesy of House Committee on Education and the Workforce Dem.\n\nInasmuch as the Affordable Care Act has become a partisan issue, Democrats have apparently been chicaned into believing it\u2019s a liberal law. This is a scam on the level of group therapy. (I hated group therapy. If I ever find my inner child, I\u2019m having an abortion.) Any actual liberals should be foaming at the mouth trying to overturn this stupid, gargantuan, legislative mess.\n\nMeanwhile, you constantly hear the ACA\u2019s supporters caterwauling that though this may not be a universal, single-payer plan, \u201cit\u2019s a step in the right direction.\u201d The fact that these people always seem to use these exact words should give you some indication as to how based this protestation is on fact, and how based it is on idiots lazily parroting talking points. My God, another person said \u201cit\u2019s a step in the right direction\u201d \u2013 I haven\u2019t been so shocked since Rosie O\u2019Donnell came out of the closet.\n\nNot only is this argument irritating, it\u2019s patently false. This law is not a step in the same direction as single-payer. It\u2019s a step in the opposite direction. To people with brain cells, this will be mind-numbingly obvious, but for the defenders of the ACA, let me explain:\n\nAn individual mandate makes health care more expensive for everyone, including the poor. Once customers are mandated to buy something from someone, the sellers raise the price. It\u2019s a basic market principle. That\u2019s how monopolies work. That\u2019s why you could put an orphanage of children through Harvard with the amount of money it takes to buy a chimichanga at Disneyland.\n\nSellers raising the price, by the way, is exactly what\u2019s happened since the ACA passed. As early as January of 2013, according to the New York Times, \u201cHealth insurance companies across the country are seeking and winning double-digit increases in premiums for some customers\u2026.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the Times, that bastion of objectivity, leapt to the law\u2019s defense in the same article, claiming one of its \u201cbiggest objectives\u201d was to \u201cstem the rapid rise in insurance costs for consumers.\u201d\n\nRight. And when Chris Brown refused to apologize for savagely beating a woman, his \u201cbiggest objective\u201d was to apologize. That\u2019s why the first album he released after the beating, F.A.M.E., was an acronym for Forgiving All My Enemies \u2013 or, as they say in Germany, Mein Kampf. It\u2019s because he was sorry.\n\nExcuse me? One of the law\u2019s \u201cbiggest objectives\u201d was to prevent insurance companies from hiking up rates, so it instituted the mandate that not only allowed, but encouraged insurance companies to hike up rates? To whom does this make sense?\n\nNow that millions of Americans \u2013 4.8 million, according to Forbes \u2013 face the prospect of being thrown off their health plans in favor of plans that comply with the new regulations, their medical costs are going to rise even more. Recipients of these new plans are going to have to shell out exorbitant amounts of money to buy coverage for medical issues that will never apply to them. Is it really necessary for eighty-five-year-year-old Grandma to dig into her retirement fund in order to purchase insurance for prenatal care? What are the odds that she\u2019s going to need it?\n\nNot to mention, this mangled leviathan of a law contains an embarrassing panoply of idiotic, self-contradictory regulations. Case in point: according to Forbes, under the ACA, insurers \u201ccharge 50 percent more to smokers.\u201d So, health insurance companies can\u2019t charge extra for pre-existing conditions, but pre-pre-existing conditions are fair game?\n\nAren\u2019t Democrats supposed to be the party that supports the right of Americans to choose what to do to their own bodies? Wasn\u2019t that the idea behind Roe v. Wade? Why has it suddenly become perfectly acceptable for this party to legislatively bully people about a personal, private health decision?\n\nAll of the above points should give you some idea as to the ethics and logic the people responsible for this law applied to it \u2013 especially since Congress, in its most revealing statement about how fabulous the ACA is, exempted themselves from it.\n\nEntrusting health care to these people is like hiring Teddy Kennedy for a driving instructor.\n\nMeanwhile, every ACA supporter you encounter will respond to all of these points with the same sophisticated, well-thought-out, nuanced argument: \u201cYou suck. You just don\u2019t like Obama because he\u2019s black.\u201d\n\nThat, or they\u2019ll start in with their infantile squealing about how nobody should try to overturn the ACA because it\u2019s \u201csettled law,\u201d as if no one in the country has ever repealed a law before.\n\nYes, it\u2019s settled law right now. So? Prohibition was settled law. Abortion bans were settled law. Proposition 8 was settled law. Why only in the case of this floundering behemoth should \u201csettled law\u201d be impervious to criticism?\n\nMainly, the reason Democrats favor the ACA doesn\u2019t seem to be the law\u2019s own merits, but the fact that its opponents tend to be Republicans \u2013 particularly Republicans of the the-only-man-inside-you-should-be-Jesus variety.\n\nWe saw the clearest crystallization of this idea when it came to the requirement that employees\u2019 insurance plans cover birth control. Because Catholics publicly groused against the contraceptive mandate, and the Catholic Church denounces artificial birth control, people seemed to think opposing the mandate was tantamount to opposing contraception altogether.\n\nThat certainly would explain why ACA advocate Sandra Fluke \u2013 remember her? \u2013 delivered a speech whining about how \u201cwe\u2019re still having the debates we thought were won before I was even born.\u201d\n\nWell, no, actually, \u201cwe\u2019re\u201d not. The debate that was won before she was born was about whether birth control should be legal. The debate over birth control in the ACA is about whether birth control coverage should be mandatory in employees\u2019 heath insurance plans \u2013 something the President insisted was necessary because \u201cI don\u2019t think a college student in Colorado Springs should have to choose between textbooks or the preventative care she needs.\u201d\n\nExcept that, according to Planned Parenthood, birth control pills can cost as little as $15 a month. Before the ACA rolled around, did you ever hear people complaining about the cost of contraception driving them into bankruptcy? This is like demanding that insurance plans cover Band-Aids.\n\n\u201cBut I don\u2019t think college students should have to choose between textbooks and the Band-Aids they need. Think of all the families who won\u2019t be able to feed their children because they\u2019ve been forced to spend their entire income on Band-Aids!\u201d\n\nAt any rate, hopefully Sandra Fluke is getting plenty of use out of all that free birth control \u2013 though somehow, after hearing that voice of hers, I doubt it.\n\nMeanwhile, once a lot of the most prominent adversaries of the contraceptive mandate turned out to be social conservatives like Rush Limbaugh and Mitt Romney, who agitated against modern, liberal views on social and reproductive issues, Fluke\u2019s fellow Democrats made the same imbecilic leap she did. They conflated opposition to the mandate with opposition to those liberal views. Ergo, anyone who holds said views should support the mandate. After all, the enemy of your enemy is your friend.\n\nExcept that sometimes, the enemy of Hitler is Stalin.\n\nWhat actually should bother the \u201cliberal\u201d proponents of this law is that the pointless costs the ACA incurs are, by definition, going to hurt poor people the most. Even the surcharge for smokers strikes a tougher blow against the poor than the rich, inasmuch as poorer people are more likely to smoke: Gallup found that, across eight income brackets in the American population, \u201cSmoking Decreases as Income Increases.\u201d\n\nWhen you think about it, that makes sense. Have you ever been to South Central? People there must take one puff of a cigarette and think, \u201cThis air is cleaner.\u201d\n\nIt is true that people who can\u2019t afford to buy private coverage have the option of accepting public assistance. They\u2019re not the issue. In fact, their coverage situation should be the liberal objective \u2013 a single-payer system like those in Canada and Britain would take this public option and expand its availability to the entire population, not just the poor. The issue is the people who can barely afford private coverage, and who suddenly have to shoulder this now-mandatory, increasingly expensive financial burden. They\u2019re the ones who are screwed.\n\nReach Contributor Sameer Suri here.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The reason Democrats favor the ACA doesn\u2019t seem to be the law\u2019s own  merits, but the fact that its opponents tend to be Republicans - particularly Republicans of the the-only-man-inside-you-should-be-Jesus variety.", "author": "Sameer Suri", "og": {"url": "http://www.neontommy.com/news/2013/11/liberal-argument-against-obamacare", "image": "http://www.neontommy.com/sites/default/files/sameerpic.jpg?1384663555", "type": "article", "description": "Obamacare is only really good for liberals in that it makes conservatives angry.", "title": "The Liberal Argument Against Obamacare"}, "twitter": {"account_id": 19560893}, "revisit-after": "1 day", "p": {"domain_verify": "4f67b85b5e96bc75e43aefc386ed9fb0"}, "google-site-verification": "Gd7gRPMvk-fLgqZF-yo5Ax5NmoCw6MBzipcz9xhUGgk"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc97a3\"", "article_summary": "We saw the clearest crystallization of this idea when it came to the requirement that employees\u2019 insurance plans cover birth control.\nThe debate that was won before she was born was about whether birth control should be legal.\nWhy only in the case of this floundering behemoth should \u201csettled law\u201d be impervious to criticism?\nInasmuch as the Affordable Care Act has become a partisan issue, Democrats have apparently been chicaned into believing it\u2019s a liberal law.\nProhibition was settled law."}
