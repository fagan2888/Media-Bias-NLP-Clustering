Hutchinson fire officials say space heaters are to blame for two house fires this weekend.

The first happened around 7:15 p.m. Saturday in the 300 block of West 6th Avenue (pictured). Crews arrived to find flames emanating from the second floor windows and the roof.

Battalion Chief Jeremy Unruh said firefighters attempted to enter the home but found it too hot at the top of the stairs. They were forced to battle the fire from the outside until it was safe for them to enter the home and put out the rest of the fire.

Crews got the fire under control in about 45 minutes.

Two people were in the home at the time of the fire, one of whom suffered minor injuries and refused treatment. One firefighter also suffered minor injuries in a fall. He was not hospitalized.

Unruh said a space heater was the cause of the fire. Damage to the home is estimated at $30,000.

The second fire occurred just after 2 p.m. Sunday in the 200 block of East 11th Avenue. Battalion Chief Rex Albright said arriving crews found heavy smoke coming from the back of the home.

It took firefighters about 30 minutes to extinguish fire they found on two levels of the home.

Everyone got out of the house safely.

Albright said the cause of the fire was an overloaded circuit that was powering a space heater. Damage to the home is also estimated at $30,000.

Firefighters say space heaters should be placed at least three feet away from any combustibles. Plug them directly into an outlet or power strip, and don't use an extension cord.
