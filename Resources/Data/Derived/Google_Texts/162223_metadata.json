Daniel L. Simmons, Sr. during his funeral services at Greater St. Luke AME Church June 30.\n\nCOLUMBIA \u2013 Gov. Nikki Haley has led the state through more tumult in the past six months than many leaders face in their entire careers: The shootings of nine Charleston churchgoers in June, the subsequent and successful charge to remove the Confederate battle flag from Statehouse grounds in July and historic flooding that killed 19 this month.\n\nOnline To stay up-to-date on South Carolina politics, go to palmettopolitics.com or download the Palmetto Politics app for iOS or Android.\n\nIt was a tumultuous year that raised the governor\u2019s political profile and has her on the short list for other national Republican offices.\n\nA prominent critic of Haley\u2019s first term, Clemson University political science professor David Woodard, had only praise for the governor\u2019s second term \u2014 as did the people he\u2019s polling.\n\n\u201cI think she\u2019s just doing splendidly right now,\u201d Woodard said. \u201cI\u2019ve been asking about Nikki Haley and she is very popular among Republican voters. Now, I realize that\u2019s not the full electorate, in other words: if they\u2019re holding her responsible for any of these things, it\u2019s not apparent in their approval of her.\u201d\n\nResearch published by political science professors from Carnegie Mellon University and Boston University in 2011 found that voters affected by natural disasters \u201crespond to powerful, random events as well as the actions that the politicians take in response.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen the governor and president do respectively request and approve a disaster declaration, they typically nullify the negative effect of the damage and may often garner a reward,\u201d professors John T. Gasper and Andrew Reeves found. \u201cThe effect of a disaster declaration is much stronger for the governor than it is for the president.\u201d\n\nRecord-breaking rainfall across the state led to historic and deadly floods the first week of October. An emergency declaration requested by Haley on Oct. 2 was approved the next day by the federal government. Two days later in a rare move, Haley received verbal approval for a major disaster declaration, which was formally issued later in the day.\n\nThe disaster put Haley back in the spotlight.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going to stop until this final situation is taken care of,\u201d Haley assured the public on Oct. 6, following disastrous dam breaks, large quantities of water heading toward the Lowcountry and a rising death toll.\n\n\u2018Stepped out front\u2019\n\nAs he watched the disaster unfold, Bob McAlister empathized with Haley and her team. He remembered sleeping in his office for a week during Hurricane Hugo when he was Gov. Carroll Campbell\u2019s deputy chief of staff and communications director.\n\n\u201cThe worst thing a leader can do in a crisis is to be timid and not be aggressive,\u201d McAlister said. \u201cThe tipping point is when people are afraid and they don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen.\u201d\n\nHugo hit in September 1989, two years into Carroll\u2019s first term. McAlister, who now runs his own public relations shop, McAlister Communications in Columbia, has no doubt that the response helped secure a second term for Carroll.\n\n\u201cCarroll Campbell played a major role; he was an unproven commodity and there was a real partisan divide in that the Legislature,\u201d McAlister said. \u201cWe were in the minority. But Carroll, just like Gov. Haley, stepped out front and said: \u2018We\u2019re going to fix it and we\u2019re going to be better than before\u2019 and he proceeded to getting it done.\u201d\n\nHaley called for evacuations in several areas out of caution over the threat of rising river levels. While some areas saw that flooding, announcements to evacuate over flood worries in Georgetown or Jamestown along the swollen Santee River didn\u2019t materialize \u2014 even as dams broke elsewhere with limited warning.\n\nMcAlister said it\u2019s easy to criticize a decision, as many did Campbell\u2019s early call to evacuate the coast.\n\n\u201c(Campbell said) \u2018I\u2019d rather take a risk saving lives than endangering them, and of course that turned out to be the right call,\u201d McAlister said. \u201cHad Hugo not done the damage it did or veered off and gone somewhere else he would\u2019ve been subject to severe criticism. But a leader in a crisis doesn\u2019t worry about critics.\u201d\n\nCollege of Charleston political science professor Gibbs Knotts credits Haley\u2019s success to several critical factors.\n\n\u201cIt goes back to being able to take decisive action, putting a good team around her and being able to talk with the people on the ground and empathize with the folks,\u201d Knotts said. \u201cShe can connect with people through ... television and social media.\u201d\n\nHaley, 43, said in her \u201cNew South\u201d speech this September that she handles her own Instagram and Facebook accounts, the latter of which saw thousands of likes and positive comments on multiple posts throughout the disaster.\n\nThat speech at the National Press Club in Washington came amid much buzz over her as a potential presidential running mate.\n\n\u201cIf a nominee asks me to sit down, of course I\u2019ll talk to them, and I\u2019ll go from there,\u201d Haley said.\n\nA cabinet post?\n\nA more immediate and prominent role may be Haley as chairman of the Republican Governors Association.\n\nHaley has raised funds and worked for the RGA\u2019s executive committee since 2011 has helped her gain more recognition as the country\u2019s youngest, current governor and only female Indian American. Time on the committee helped propel careers of Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal and former Texas Gov. Rick Perry.\n\nCurrent RGA vice chairwoman New Mexico Gov. Susana Martinez could also snag the spot as Republicans are in need of attracting Latino voters, especially as the party tries to mitigate damage rendered to the voting block by candidates. VP and cabinet buzz also swirls around Martinez, a two-term governor, former district attorney and member of the committee since 2011.\n\nThe executive committee election will be decided by 31 Republican governors, at the annual conference on Nov. 19. The term would cover the critical span of the 2016 presidential election cycle.\n\nThe RGA chair position brings a lot of attention, S.C. GOP Chairman Matt Moore said. Haley\u2019s proven her executive ability during the unprecedented year of tragedies.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about being a confident, skilled governor, which she is, and presenting a very positive vision for where the Republican Party is going, and she\u2019s doing that as well,\u201d Moore said. \u201cShe has not been afraid to speak on not only the party\u2019s direction, but when presidential candidates step out of line.\u201d\n\nHe added her work with the RGA can\u2019t be underestimated either.\n\n\u201cI know she did a good job at helping the RGA fundraise and as a top surrogate for them,\u201d Moore said about Haley. \u201cThey\u2019d be wise to put her talents to work.\u201d\n\nNew Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, served with Haley when he was RGA chairman, attended her inauguration this year and reached out to her in support during the recent flooding.\n\nChristie, who is running for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination, did not comment on Haley\u2019s most recent tragedy, but spoke highly of her when he backed her on removing the Confederate battle flag.\n\n\u201cGovernor Haley has demonstrated what it means to be a leader during extremely difficult and tragic times for her state and our country,\u201d Christie said in a June 23 statement.\n\nSandy caused $39 billion in damages to New Jersey in October 2012 and became a defining moment of Christie\u2019s legacy, just as many see the events of 2015 will define Haley\u2019s.\n\n\u201cStrong people need strong leaders and strong leaders need strong people,\u201d McAlister said. \u201cAnd in these three crises South Carolina had both.\u201d\n\nNationally syndicated columnist Jack Kelly recently wrote a column titled \u201cInexperience isn\u2019t a liability\u201d in which he named his \u201cdream cabinet\u201d should a Republican Party win.\n\n\u201cFortunately, there are many qualified people on a deep Republican bench to fill them,\u201d Kelly wrote. \u201cI\u2019m thinking in particular of South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, who has drawn well-deserved praise for how she\u2019s handled the Charleston church shooting, the Confederate flag flap and the recent flooding.\u201d\n\nMany observers didn\u2019t speculate on Haley\u2019s next move. Woodard would be surprised by a vice presidential selection, and suggested, like Knotts, that a cabinet post would fit.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s about figuring out what she\u2019s going to do next in life,\u201d Knotts said. \u201cWhether she wants to wade into the national political environment, but getting the amount of media coverage and being able to handle things, those are the types of things people can remember you for.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Gov.
