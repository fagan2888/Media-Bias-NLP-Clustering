Facebook (né TheFacebook.com) will celebrate its 10th birthday next week. It seems like just yesterday that college students were up in arms over high schoolers being allowed to use the social network. Now everyone—your 13-year-old cousin and her Facebook drama, your uncle that hates Obamacare, your grandma who comments on all your pictures, YOUR MOM—is on Facebook.

To be more precise: There are over 1.1 billion users on Facebook now.

If you've seen The Social Network, you already know the story: Mark Zuckerberg allegedly stole the idea from two Armie Hammers and used it to get back at his ex-girlfriend, The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo, and then screwed Spider-Man out of the company and Justin Timberlake was there for some reason and had a one-night stand with the Fifty Shades of Grey girl. That classic story.

But here's the real question: How much time have you spent on Facebook over the years?!
