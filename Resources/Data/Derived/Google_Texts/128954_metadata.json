LOUIS \u2014 Madison Bumgarner once again put the San Francisco Giants well on the road to a playoff victory.\n\nBumgarner pitched shutout ball into the eighth inning and the Giants combined just enough hitting with a couple of defensive flubs by St. Louis to beat the Cardinals 3-0 Saturday night in the NL Championship Series opener.\n\nBumgarner set a major league postseason record with 26 2/3 consecutive scoreless innings on the road.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s pretty cool,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s stats for everything nowadays. I\u2019ve happened to have a little extra good luck on the road.\u201d\n\nMaybe, although his numbers show that perhaps it\u2019s more than luck. In four postseason road starts, he\u2019s 4-0 with an 0.59 ERA.\n\nThe left-hander, already a key part of two World Series championship teams in San Francisco, was in complete command.\n\nBut 20-game winner Adam Wainwright made another early exit for the Cardinals. In his two playoff outings this month, he\u2019s failed to last even five innings.\n\n\u201cI think there\u2019s a scenario out there where I give up one run,\u201d Wainwright said. \u201cAs ugly as it was, I would say my arm felt better than last time.\u201d\n\nPablo Sandoval got three hits as San Francisco won for the 12th time in its last 13 postseason games, including three straight victories to erase a 3-1 deficit in the 2012 NLCS against St. Louis.\n\n\u201cMan, exciting to be in October, you know,\u201d Sandoval said. \u201cLast year I was home watching the game on TV.\u201d\n\nJake Peavy gets the Game 2 start for the Giants on Sunday night against Lance Lynn.\n\nBumgarner, who began the playoffs by throwing a shutout at Pittsburgh in the wild-card game, gave up four hits in 7 2-3 innings.\n\nBumgarner bested the mark of 23 straight postseason scoreless innings on the road set by Art Nehf of the New York Giants from 1921-24.\n\nThe Cardinals\u2019 threatened against him only in the seventh on consecutive one-out singles by Yadier Molina and Jon Jay, but Kolten Wong tapped out and pinch-hitter Tony Cruz fanned.\n\nThe Giants\u2019 bullpen finished with hitless relief as Sergio Romo got the last out in the eighth and Santiago Casilla closed for a save.\n\nWainwright was 20-9 during the regular season, including 5-0 with a 1.38 ERA in September with two complete games and a shutout. He\u2019s piled up a major league-high 512 2-3 innings the last two years.\n\nThe right-hander admitted before this series that his pitching elbow had bothered him during a start in the division series at Dodger Stadium.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not 100 percent,\u201d Wainwright said. \u201cI think it was 100 percent better than it was the last time I pitched, I\u2019ll say that.\u201d\n\nIn two October starts this year, Wainwright has permitted eight earned runs in nine innings. He\u2019s 0-4 with a 5.14 ERA in his last five postseason appearances \u2014 he lasted 4 2-3 innings against the Giants after going just 4 1-3 innings in the NLDS opener vs. Los Angeles.\n\nThe Cardinals twice failed to seal the deal defensively in the Giants\u2019 two-run second.\n\nThird baseman Matt Carpenter\u2019s fielding error with the bases loaded on Gregor Blanco\u2019s soft one-hop liner at his feet was their first error of the postseason.\n\nSandoval doubled to start the inning when rookie right fielder Randal Grichuk gloved the ball but couldn\u2019t hang on as he ran into the wall. Travis Ishikawa, 0 for 5 with five strikeouts and a walk against Wainwright, had an RBI single on a jam-shot bloop just over Carpenter\u2019s head in shallow left.\n\nWong misplayed a double-play ball at second base in the third, and Brandon Belt\u2019s sacrifice fly made it 3-0.\n\n\u201cWe make a few plays and we can still be out there playing right now,\u201d manager Mike Matheny said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Bumgarner set a major league postseason record with 26 2/3 consecutive scoreless innings on the road.
