Ted Cruz (R-TX) would \u201callow unlimited direct contributions by citizens and lawful permanent residents of the United States to candidates in Federal elections.\u201d That quote is not from a commentator critical of the bill. Nor is it from a policy analysis explaining the bill\u2019s effects. That\u2019s actually a quote from the text of the bill itself. If nothing else, the Tea Party senator isn\u2019t trying to hide the ball here.\n\nYet, while Cruz is quite upfront about his bill\u2019s intentions in the text of the legislation, the title of the bill is more misleading \u2014 Cruz named his legislation allowing billionaires to write unlimited checks to political candidates the \u201cSuperPAC Elimination Act of 2014.\u201d Eliminating all limits on campaign donations would indeed deal a serious blow to the continued viability of SuperPACs, which are a mechanism high-dollar donors use to evade the still-existing limits on donations directly to candidates, but it would deal this blow because there is little reason to evade a limit that no longer exists.\n\nAlthough the Supreme Court has largely eliminated restrictions on wealthy individuals and corporations who want to use their fortunes to influence elections, the Court currently still permits campaign finance regulation that targets a very narrowly defined form of corruption. Federal or state legislation may still target so-called \u201cquid pro quo\u201d corruption, where a donor offers \u201cdollars for political favors,\u201d even under this Supreme Court\u2019s very narrow view of what kinds of campaign finance legislation is permissible. For this reason, the Roberts Court still allows limits on the amount of money that can be given directly to candidates \u2014 as opposed to donations to outside groups such as SuperPACs \u2014 because a donor who writes a massive check to a politician is particularly likely to secure political favors in return.\n\nCruz\u2019s bill, however, would eliminate one of the few forms of campaign finance regulation that Roberts Court deems acceptable \u2014 or, at least, that it finds acceptable for the time being.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "The problem with American elections, according to Ted Cruz, is that very wealthy campaign donors do not have enough power to shape their outcomes.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "The problem with American elections, according to Ted Cruz, is that very wealthy campaign donors do not have enough power to shape their outcomes.", "title": "Ted Cruz Introduces Bill That Would Eliminate All Limits On Campaign Donations", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/justice/2014/06/03/3444422/ted-cruz-introduces-that-would-eliminate-all-limits-on-campaign-donations/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Ted-Cruz-e1401815683769.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The problem with American elections, according to Ted Cruz, is that very wealthy campaign donors do not have enough power to shape their outcomes.", "title": "Ted Cruz Introduces Bill That Would Eliminate All Limits On Campaign Donations", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Ted-Cruz-e1401815683769-321x214.jpg", "creator": "@imillhiser", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-justice", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Ted-Cruz-e1401815683769.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Ted-Cruz-e1401815683769.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2014-06-03T14:01:45+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/IanMillhiserPublic"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fddeb3\"", "article_summary": "Justice Ted Cruz Introduces Bill That Would Eliminate All Limits On Campaign Donations CREDIT: AP Photo/Alex BrandonA bill introduced on Tuesday by Sen.
