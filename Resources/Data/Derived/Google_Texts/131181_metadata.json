Obama has redefined the black vote, as a necessary, no-margin-of-error 95% bloc majority to offset his similar creation of an increasingly monolithic 65% bloc white vote. We are no longer individual voters, but, in Chicago-politics style, merely faceless \u201cLatinos,\u201d \u201cAsians,\u201d \u201cAfrican-Americans,\u201d \u201cgays,\u201d \u201cwomen,\u201d and now \u201cwhites.\u201d\n\nObama issues a new initiative\u2014and the nation snoozes. He wastes the day on the golf links\u2014and the nation snoozes. He smear his critics, invites a rapper to the White House whose latest album cover has a dead white judge lying in front of the White House\u2014and the nation snoozes. He cozies up to America\u2019s enemies and snubs our friends\u2014and the nation snoozes. For the nth time, he blusters about closing down Guantanamo\u2014and the nation snoozes. He opens the border even wider to welcome in more illegal aliens and future constituents\u2014and the nation snoozes. Lame duckestry means not even being able to wake up your opponents.\n\nThere is so far no Obama legacy, except the creation of Donald Trump, a $20 trillion debt and zero interest rates\u2014and the gift of flat energy prices that came despite not because of Obama\u2019s efforts. Almost every major bureaucracy is awash in scandal or charges of incompetence. The common theme of the disasters at the GSA, EPA, ICE, IRS, NASA, Secret Service, and VA is ideological subversion and ingrained hostility to meritocracy. Would anyone be surprised that another government official pled the 5th, created fake email personas, resigned at 5 PM on a Friday afternoon, declared a foremost mission Muslim outreach, or withheld subpoenaed documents?", "article_metadata": {"page-title": "President Obama's Radical Policies Damaged America", "pinterest": "nopin", "og": {"site_name": "Works and Days", "description": "A tiny man, boxed in by his own radical policies.", "title": "Obama: The Lamest Duck", "url": "https://pjmedia.com/victordavishanson/obama-the-lamest-duck/", "image": "https://pajamasmed.hs.llnwd.net/e1/victordavishanson/user-content/2/files/2016/02/article_banner_template_11-18-15-1.sized-770x415xc.jpg", "updated_time": 1464348990, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A tiny man, boxed in by his own radical policies.", "title": "Obama: The Lamest Duck", "url": "https://pjmedia.com/victordavishanson/obama-the-lamest-duck/", "image": "https://pajamasmed.hs.llnwd.net/e1/victordavishanson/user-content/2/files/2016/02/article_banner_template_11-18-15-1.sized-770x415xc.jpg", "site": "@PJMedia_com", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "President Obama's Radical Policies Damaged America", "pinterestDescription": "Obama: The Lamest Duck", "fb": {"app_id": 149848758413844}, "keywords": "barack obama", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Obama: The Lamest DuckPresident Obama is boxed in a state of paralysis\u2014more so than typical lame-duck presidents.\nObama has redefined the black vote, as a necessary, no-margin-of-error 95% bloc majority to offset his similar creation of an increasingly monolithic 65% bloc white vote.\nHe opens the border even wider to welcome in more illegal aliens and future constituents\u2014and the nation snoozes.\nWe are no longer individual voters, but, in Chicago-politics style, merely faceless \u201cLatinos,\u201d \u201cAsians,\u201d \u201cAfrican-Americans,\u201d \u201cgays,\u201d \u201cwomen,\u201d and now \u201cwhites.\u201dObama issues a new initiative\u2014and the nation snoozes.\nHe cozies up to America\u2019s enemies and snubs our friends\u2014and the nation snoozes."}
