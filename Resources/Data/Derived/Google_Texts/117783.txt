A Washington Post reported who has been held in captivity for more than 500 days was allowed by Iran to have a Christmas dinner with his family.

The Post reported on Friday that reporter Jason Rezaian was granted the time with his family, which the publication’s editor noted was a rare reprieve.

“We are enormously pleased that our colleague Jason was permitted to spend extended time with his mother Mary and his wife Yegi,” Post executive editor Martin Baron said in a statement.

“And yet, we have to note, this visit is a rare exception in the 522 days of tragic, unjust imprisonment of a good, honorable and innocent man.

“We welcome this act of basic humanity, and we encourage his jailers in Iran to follow up by doing all that justice and decency require: Release Jason from prison and allow him a return to life as a free man who can spend time with his family where and whenever he pleases.”

Rezaian, 39, was sentenced on charges of espionage earlier this fall after already serving a lengthy time behind bars.

The Post has repeated criticized Iran’s actions, calling his trial and sentencing a “sham” and arguing that he has done nothing wrong.

The U.S. government has also called for Rezaian to be released.

Members of Congress critical of the Obama administration’s nuclear deal with Iran sought to link Rezaian’s release to those talks.

Rezaian holds citizenship in both Iran and the United States.

Yeganeh Salehi, the reporter’s wife, told The Post that this is the first time she’d been able to bring her husband a home-cooked meal and have an extended visit in months.
