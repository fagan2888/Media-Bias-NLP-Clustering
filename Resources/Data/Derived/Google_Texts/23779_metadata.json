Obama has frequently claimed that hurricanes and other weather events will get more severe as humans emit more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.\n\nBut the facts aren\u2019t on the president\u2019s side when it comes to hurricanes. NHC experts will likely report to Obama Thursday they expect a relatively weak hurricane season this year, possibly continuing the U.S. \u201churricane drought\u201d even longer.\n\nIt\u2019s been 3,503 days since a Category 3 or greater hurricane has made landfall in the U.S., according to storm data. The last major hurricane to make landfall in the U.S. was in 2005 when Hurricane Wilma hit Florida. Experts have dubbed this nine-year and seven-month period as a \u201churricane drought.\u201d\n\nThe lack of major hurricanes hitting the U.S. in the last decade has baffled scientists, and some have attributed the hurricane \u201cdrought\u201d to dumb luck. A recent study by NASA found that the U.S. has just been lucky this past decade when it comes to major hurricanes.\n\n\u201cWhen we looked qualitatively at the nine-year drought, they aren\u2019t inactive seasons,\u201d lead author Timothy Hall with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration\u2019s Goddard Institute for Space Studies said in a statement. \u201cI don\u2019t believe there is a major regime shift that\u2019s protecting the U.S.\u201d\n\nSo far, the consensus among scientists is that global warming will cause fewer hurricanes, some of which will be made more intense as humans increase carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere. But even that\u2019s been elusive so far as major storms seem to be bypassing the U.S.\n\nThe National Interagency Coordination Center reported that the \u201c2014 Atlantic Hurricane season was the least active in twenty years with only eight named storms in the Atlantic basin.\u201d NICC noted that no named storms made landfall in the U.S., but one tropical storm did hit Hawaii in August 2014.\n\nFor 2013, the National Hurricane Center reported there were \u201cTHERE WERE NO MAJOR HURRICANES IN THE NORTH ATLANTIC BASIN FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE 1994\u201d and that \u201cTHE NUMBER OF HURRICANES THIS YEAR WAS THE LOWEST SINCE 1982.\u201d (Capitalization in the original).\n\nDespite this, Obama staffers keep arguing that global warming will endanger more Americans living on the coasts as storms get more severe.\n\n\u201cEven if climate change were not a factor, the president would be urging people to be vigilant,\u201d White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest told reporters on a conference call. \u201cBut what the preponderance of scientific evidence tells us is that climate change is having an impact on more violent and more frequent storms.\u201d\n\nBut Earnest\u2019s claim the science is on his side may be premature. Hurricane expert Dr. Ryan Maue has data showing that globally hurricane numbers are way down from where they were in the 1970s as well as where they were in the 1990s.\n\nWeather forecasters predict that this year\u2019s hurricane season will be \u201cbelow normal\u201d with \u201ca 70 percent likelihood of 6 to 11 named storms\u2026 of which 3 to 6 could become hurricanes\u2026 including zero to 2 major hurricanes,\u201d according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.\n\n\u201cWhile a below-normal season is likely (70 percent), there is also a 20 percent chance of a near-normal season, and a 10 percent chance of an above-normal season,\u201d NOAA reported, adding that the presence of a weak El Ni\u00f1o this year could intensify storms.\n\n\u201c\u201dhe main factor expected to suppress the hurricane season this year is El Ni\u00f1o, which is already affecting wind and pressure patterns, and is forecast to last through the hurricane season,\u201d Dr. Gerry Bell, the lead hurricane forecaster at NOAA said in a statement.\n\n\u201cEl Ni\u00f1o may also intensify as the season progresses, and is expected to have its greatest influence during the peak months of the season,\u201d Bell said. \u201cWe also expect sea surface temperatures in the tropical Atlantic to be close to normal, whereas warmer waters would have supported storm development.\u201d\n\nFollow Michael on Twitter and Facebook\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
