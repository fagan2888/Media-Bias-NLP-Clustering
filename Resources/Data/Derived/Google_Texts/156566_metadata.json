But few, if any, railroads are expected to meet the deadline. Now lawmakers are proposing to give railroads another five to seven years to get the task done.\n\nThe technology uses GPS, wireless radio and computers to monitor train position. It can automatically brake to prevent derailments due to excessive speed, collisions with other trains, trains entering track where maintenance is being done or going the wrong way because of a switching mistake. It\u2019s all aimed at preventing human error, which is responsible for about 40 percent of train accidents.\n\nA preliminary review of the Amtrak train\u2019s event data recorder, or \u201cblack box,\u201d shows it was traveling at 106 mph in an 80 mph zone just before it entered a curve where the speed limit is 50 mph, National Transportation Safety Board member Robert Sumwalt said Wednesday. The train\u2019s engineer applied maximum braking power seconds before the crash, but it was too late.\n\n\u201cWe feel that had such a system been installed in this section of track, this accident would not have occurred,\u201d Sumwalt told reporters.\n\nAt least seven people were killed and about 200 injured in the derailment.\n\nThe Philadelphia accident shares similarities with a 2013 derailment in New York on the Monday morning after Thanksgiving. A Metro-North commuter train derailed in the Bronx, killing four and injuring dozens of others. The train\u2019s engineer had fallen asleep and failed to slow the train from 82 mph to the maximum authorized speed of 30 mph as it entered a curve. An NTSB investigation concluded that crash would also have been prevented by positive train control.\n\nNot counting Tuesday\u2019s derailment, the NTSB has investigated 29 passenger and freight train accidents that officials say could have been prevented by positive train control since 2004. Sixty-eight people died and more than 1,100 were injured in those crashes. The board has been urging installation of the technology, or its precursors, for 45 years.\n\nIn 2008, a month after a commuter train and a freight train collided in Chatsworth, California, killing 25 people, Congress passed a law requiring that positive train control be installed by Dec. 31, 2015. But railroads have long complained that complications will prevent them from meeting that deadline.\n\nIn March, the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee approved a bill that would give railroads until 2020 to install the technology, and another two years after that if they need more time. The Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen, which opposed the bill, complained at the time that some of its provisions would make it virtually impossible for federal regulators to ever force freight railroads to implement the technology.\n\nAt least three of the bill\u2019s key sponsors \u2014 Sens. John Thune, R-S.D., Roy Blunt, R-Mo., and Claire McCaskill, D-Mo. \u2014 have each received more than $100,000 in contributions to their campaigns and political committees from the rail industry over the course of their careers in Congress, according to the political money-tracking website OpenSecrets.org.\n\nThe three senators said in statements or through their aides that reports by government agencies show railroads need more time. One of the hurdles is getting all the railroads to agree on systems that will work on everyone\u2019s tracks despite differing policies and operations. Such interoperability is necessary because freight railroads frequently operate on each other\u2019s tracks. Commuter railroads and Amtrak also often operate on freight rail tracks.\n\nAmtrak has been one of the more aggressive railroads in installing the technology. Three years ago, Amtrak announced it expected to finish installing positive train control throughout its busy Northeast Corridor by the end of 2012. While positive train control is in operation in much of the corridor between New York and Boston and on some other Amtrak lines in the Midwest, other portions still lack the technology. Amtrak officials didn\u2019t reply to questions from The Associated Press about why the technology hadn\u2019t been installed on the Philadelphia tracks where the derailment took place.\n\n\u201cFor decades we have seen preventable derailments and collisions occur,\u201d said former NTSB Chairman Deborah A.P. Hersman. \u201cIf we do not implement technology such as PTC to prevent these events, we will continue to see them for the foreseeable future.\u201d\n\nSen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., a commerce committee member who voted against the bill, blamed the Federal Railroad Administration in part for not leaning hard enough on railroads over the past seven years to get the job done.\n\n\u201cThere is more evidence than ever that it is irresponsible and reprehensible to grant so long an extension,\u201d Blumenthal said.\n\nOne of the obstacles is the cost to industry of implementing positive train control, estimated in the billions of dollars. A Republican-controlled House panel approved deep spending cuts to Amtrak\u2019s budget on Wednesday just hours after the Philadelphia accident. An attempt by Democratic lawmakers to boost Amtrak spending by $1 billion was rebuffed.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The deadly Amtrak derailment near Philadelphia appears to be yet another accident that didn't have to happen.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "The deadly Amtrak derailment near Philadelphia appears to be yet another accident that didn\u2019t have to happen.", "title": "Safety technology might have prevented deadly Amtrak crash", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/may/14/safety-technology-might-have-prevented-deadly-amtr/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/05/14/f2cb8d6e6b996315760f6a706700b611.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/05/14/f2cb8d6e6b996315760f6a706700b611.jpg", "description": "The deadly Amtrak derailment near Philadelphia appears to be yet another accident that didn't have to happen.", "card": "summary", "title": "Safety technology might have prevented deadly Amtrak crash"}, "Author": "Joan Lowy", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Disaster Accident, Philadelphia, National Transportation Safety Board, Congress"}, "article_summary": "An NTSB investigation concluded that crash would also have been prevented by positive train control.\nIt can automatically brake to prevent derailments due to excessive speed, collisions with other trains, trains entering track where maintenance is being done or going the wrong way because of a switching mistake.\nOne of the obstacles is the cost to industry of implementing positive train control, estimated in the billions of dollars.\nNot counting Tuesday\u2019s derailment, the NTSB has investigated 29 passenger and freight train accidents that officials say could have been prevented by positive train control since 2004.\nThree years ago, Amtrak announced it expected to finish installing positive train control throughout its busy Northeast Corridor by the end of 2012."}
