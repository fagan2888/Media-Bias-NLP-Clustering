Jebsen Center of Exercise in Medicine at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology.\n\nVarious studies of older adults, college students, adolescents and children each have concluded that the standard formula was wrong for them.\n\n\"The traditional formula can underestimate heart rate max by up to 40 beats per minute in seniors,\" Wisloff said, \"and starts becoming inaccurate already at the age of 30 or 40 years.\"\n\nA better formulation for both sexes would be 211 minus 64 percent of age. Should your brain revolt at the thought of the math required to determine maximum heart rate with those numbers, Wisloff's lab has posted a simple calculator online.\n\nBear in mind that knowing your maximum heart rate is \"not needed to have effective training sessions,\" Wisloff pointed out. \"But many people find it motivating\" -- especially when the formula is correct.\n\n\u2013Gretchen Reynolds, The New York Times", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://health.heraldtribune.com/files/2013/06/26well_physed-tmagArticle-cropHF.jpg"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}}, "article_summary": "Bear in mind that knowing your maximum heart rate is \"not needed to have effective training sessions,\" Wisloff pointed out.\nShould your brain revolt at the thought of the math required to determine maximum heart rate with those numbers, Wisloff's lab has posted a simple calculator online.\n\"The traditional formula can underestimate heart rate max by up to 40 beats per minute in seniors,\" Wisloff said, \"and starts becoming inaccurate already at the age of 30 or 40 years.\"\nYou might reasonably assume that the maximal heart rate formula of 220 minus age is based on a large, reliable body of data, since it is so widely used as the basis of the target-heart-rate posters hanging in your local gym.\nVarious studies of older adults, college students, adolescents and children each have concluded that the standard formula was wrong for them."}
