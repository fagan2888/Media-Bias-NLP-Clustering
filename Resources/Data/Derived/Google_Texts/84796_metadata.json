First the Hobby Lobby decision, now this.\n\nThings you can only learn on Fox News, this time courtesy of anchor Jon Scott:Not only that, said Scott, but White House press secretary Josh Earnest appeared to be \"thumbing his nose at the Supreme Court\" by dismissing the decision.\n\nNow, if you're scratching your head and wondering how the Supreme Court managed to issue a ruling against Obamacare without you finding out about it, don't despair: There was no Supreme Court decision. Instead, a D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals panel ruled that Obamacare does not authorize subsides in states with federally-run exchanges. The panel's decision, however, was far from definitive: two previous courts had reached the opposite conclusion, and shortly after the ruling, a third court weighed in, upholding Obamacare exchanges. Nonetheless, it took Scott nearly five minutes to finally clear things up:\n\n\n\nThe appeals court in Richmond, which is a separate appeals court from the one in D.C., just issued a ruling on apparently the very same topic. They decided that the Obamacare subsidies are legal. So you've got two courts, equal in status\u2014two appeals courts\u2014with very different rulings. That would seem like it's going to hasten this decision in the lap of the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nYeah, it hadn't \"just issued a ruling.\" That ruling had been out for nearly an hour, yet Scott still managed to botch the story from the start. I guess it's better to get things right late than never, but I really do feel bad for the thousands of Fox viewers who were no doubt crushed to learn that despite reports to the contrary, Obamacare lives on.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Daily Kos", "description": "Not even the Fox Chyron writers got the story as wrong as Jon Scott\n\nThings you can only learn on Fox News, this time courtesy of anchor Jon Scott:\n\n...", "title": "Fox News anchor breaks the news: Supreme Court rules against Obamacare", "url": "http://www.dailykos.com/story/2014/7/22/1315796/-Fox-News-anchor-breaks-the-news-Supreme-Court-rules-against-Obamacare", "image": "http://images.dailykos.com/images/95924/story_image/breakingonfox.jpg?1406052413", "type": "article"}, "csrf-param": "authenticity_token", "fb": {"app_id": 170357783709}, "twitter": {"description": "Not even the Fox Chyron writers got the story as wrong as Jon Scott\n\nThings you can only learn on Fox News, this time courtesy of anchor Jon Scott:\nObamacare has taken two consecutive hits now from...", "creator": "@jedlewison", "image": {"src": "http://images.dailykos.com/images/95924/story_image/breakingonfox.jpg?1406052413"}, "title": "Fox News anchor breaks the news: Supreme Court rules against Obamacare", "site": "@dailykos", "card": "summary_large_image"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd01da\"", "article_summary": "Now, if you're scratching your head and wondering how the Supreme Court managed to issue a ruling against Obamacare without you finding out about it, don't despair: There was no Supreme Court decision.\nThat would seem like it's going to hasten this decision in the lap of the U.S. Supreme Court.\nCircuit Court of Appeals panel ruled that Obamacare does not authorize subsides in states with federally-run exchanges.\nNonetheless, it took Scott nearly five minutes to finally clear things up:The appeals court in Richmond, which is a separate appeals court from the one in D.C., just issued a ruling on apparently the very same topic.\nNot even the Fox Chyron writers got the story as wrong as Jon ScottNot even the Fox Chyron writers got the story as wrong as Jon ScottObamacare has taken two consecutive hits now from the Supreme Court."}
