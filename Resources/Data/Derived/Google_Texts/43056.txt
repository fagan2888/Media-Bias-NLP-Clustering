Bill Maher tonight tackled Jonathan Gruber‘s comments about the stupidity of American voters by agreeing 100 percent with what he said. Maher played a montage of him saying in past interviews that Americans are, in fact, stupid.

Maher jokingly called himself Gruber’s “soulmate” and couldn’t fathom how this was controversial. He cited studies showing how few Americans can name the three branches of government and how people dislike Obamacare but like individual parts of it.

Canadian MP Chrystia Freeland defended Americans a bit, arguing that it’s not their fault if they don’t know all the intricacies of health care reform. She and Maher fought a bit, and Maher said, “Gruber was right, he just said what people don’t want to hear.”
