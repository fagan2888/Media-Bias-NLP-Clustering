Bourgeois High School and deliberately exposing the student to HIV. The HIV-positive 37-year-old was charged on Friday with felony carnal knowledge of a juvenile and intentional exposure to the AIDS-causing virus.\n\nThis past Wednesday, Terrebonne Parish authorities arrested Nesby at H.L. Bourgeois High School after investigators were tipped off to the alleged incident by a school resource officer. Nesby was first employed by the school as a teacher and freshman track coach around a year ago. Authorities first questioned Nesby about alleged sexual misconduct toward a student back in early May.\n\n\"We can establish the fact that there was an encounter that happened,\" Terrebonne Parish Sheriff's Chief of Detectives Malcolm Wolfe told WWLTV. \"We continued our investigation where we established more evidence that something did happen, and at that point we got a warrant for his arrest.\u201d\n\nIntentional exposure to the AIDS-causing virus was only added to Nesby\u2019s charges after detectives discovered he was HIV-positive through the course of their investigation. He has since been fired from the high school but denies his part in all of the allegations. Authorities say the 16-year-old student had no way of knowing that Nesby was HIV-positive, but they are unable to comment on when the incident took place.\n\nEach felony charge Nesby is facing carries a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison. Upon having his second felony charge added on Friday, Nesby\u2019s bond has been doubled from $500,000 to $1 million while he awaits trial.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "hiv, positive, teacher, derrick, nesby", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "A Louisiana HIV-positive teacher has been charged with felony carnal knowledge of a juvenile and intentional exposure to the AIDS-causing virus after deliberately infecting his 16-year-old male student with the virus.", "title": "HIV-Positive Teacher Exposes 16-Year-Old Male Student To Virus [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/hiv-positive-louisiana-teacher-charged-deliberately-exposing-16-year-old-student-virus-286136", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/03/derrick-nesby.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A Louisiana HIV-positive teacher has been charged with felony carnal knowledge of a juvenile and intentional exposure to the AIDS-causing virus after deliberately infecting his 16-year-old male student with the virus.", "title": "HIV-Positive Teacher Exposes 16-Year-Old Male Student To Virus [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/hiv-positive-louisiana-teacher-charged-deliberately-exposing-16-year-old-student-virus-286136", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/03/derrick-nesby.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/03/derrick-nesby.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2014-06-03T12:00:46-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-06-03T12:00:45-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "A Louisiana HIV-positive teacher has been charged with felony carnal knowledge of a juvenile and intentional exposure to the AIDS-causing virus after deliberately infecting his 16-year-old male student with the virus."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc2e7\"", "article_summary": "Louisiana school teacher and track coach Derrick Nesby has been accused of having sex with a 16-year-old male student at H.L.\nBourgeois High School and deliberately exposing the student to HIV.\nBourgeois High School after investigators were tipped off to the alleged incident by a school resource officer.\nHe has since been fired from the high school but denies his part in all of the allegations.\nThe HIV-positive 37-year-old was charged on Friday with felony carnal knowledge of a juvenile and intentional exposure to the AIDS-causing virus."}
