In FY2014 the deficit was $483 billion; in FY2015 it\u2019ll be $468 billion.

Nor can we reliably predict what form the resulting fiscal crisis will take. It could mean an inexorable deterioration of the US economy.25 Or it could be more abrupt, with creditors losing faith and pulling their funds from the United States overnight, throwing the country into a vicious debt spiral, another deep recession, and ultimately a lower standard of living here and around the world.\n\nThis outcome is not inevitable, but it grows dangerously more likely as policymakers delay taking action. Continued failure to reform the main drivers of current and future spending and debt\u2014principally Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security, and the Affordable Care Act\u2014will eventually force deep and highly destabilizing policy changes. Only by acting soon and maintaining a longterm commitment to controlling spending can policymakers avoid a potentially irreversible decline in Americans\u2019 standard of living.\n\nThat\u2019s quite similar to the warnings in the CBO report itself.\n\nAlso, worth noting, the CBO lowered its projections of economic growth:\n\nLast August, CBO projected real GDP growth averaging 2.7 percent per year for 2014 through 2018; CBO now anticipates that real GDP growth will average 2.5 percent annually over that period. The revision mainly reflects a reduction in CBO\u2019s estimate of potential output and therefore of the current amount of slack in the economy.
