You walk away with a repaired toaster, and a skill.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very empowering,\u201d said Lo, 44, a waste reduction and recycling specialist with Hennepin County\u2019s Department of Environmental Services. \u201cIf you can fix a belt on your vacuum cleaner, maybe you start to think, \u2018I can fix this lamp.\u2019 It\u2019s a whole mind-set that starts once you fix something.\u201d\n\nLo, of Minneapolis, was a Star Tribune copy editor when she saw that there were too few recycling bins for all the paper being discarded. \u201cI\u2019d scrounge around in the basement for containers,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople started asking me questions: \u2018Where should I take this?\u2019 \u2018What about packing peanuts and bubble wrap?\u2019 \u201d\n\nShe discovered that she liked being a resource for people, so she joined an AmeriCorps program, which connected her to the Minnesota Green Corps, which placed her with Hennepin County. The first Fix-It clinic opened in 2012.\n\n\u201cEverybody has broken stuff, but we may not know how to fix it or what\u2019s needed, so we throw it away and buy new,\u201d Lo said. \u201cThe clinics are a way to not have to throw something away.\u201d\n\nShe\u2019s thrilled about the success of the clinics, but would like to attract more kids. \u201cAt home, they tend to hear, \u2018Don\u2019t take that apart. Don\u2019t make a mess.\u2019 Here\u2019s a chance to do all those things they\u2019re naturally curious about and inclined to do.\u201d\n\nNot everything is fixable, and participants are expected to help, so she admits the clinics aren\u2019t for everyone.\n\n\u201cIt does take a little bit of time,\u201d she said, adding that there\u2019s no shame in paying someone else to repair something for you. The point is to try to fix what you have.\n\nAnd if that blender or iPod really is kaput, \u201cat least now you can make a good decision about throwing it away.\u201d There\u2019s also info on drop-off sites for electronics recycling.\n\nLo wants to expand our definition of re-use and recycle.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d like see more interest in reducing the amount of food we throw away, not overbuying at the grocery store. Those aren\u2019t really expiration dates on the labels, as in, food isn\u2019t going to poison you. There\u2019s just no reason we have to waste that much food.\u201d\n\nHer recycled profession has paid off in many ways.\n\n\u201cThe repair spirit is starting to spread,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd it never hurts to be called awesome.\u201d\n\nYou can find a Fix-It clinic near you at the Hennepin County web site.", "article_metadata": {"description": "&nbsp;.", "og": {"site_name": "Star Tribune", "description": "&nbsp;.", "title": "Minneapolis' Nancy Lo is a champion of home repair \u2013 and the nation is noticing", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/minneapolis-nancy-lo-is-a-champion-of-home-repair-and-the-nation-is-noticing/372481351/", "image": {"url": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_145825199144239.jpg?h=630&w=1200&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "width": 1200, "identifier": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_145825199144239.jpg?h=630&w=1200&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "&nbsp;.", "title": "Minneapolis' Nancy Lo is a champion of home repair \u2013 and the nation is noticing", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/minneapolis-nancy-lo-is-a-champion-of-home-repair-and-the-nation-is-noticing/372481351/", "image": {"src": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_145825199144239.jpg?h=560&w=750&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "identifier": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_145825199144239.jpg?h=560&w=750&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces"}, "site": "@StarTribune", "card": "summary"}, "article": {"tag": "Fixit Clinic"}, "google-site-verification": "bLXTXkzm4dJ8hcJy1LXawtxXxGP3JhInARj69uCiMiM", "news_keywords": "Fixit Clinic"}, "article_summary": "\u201cI\u2019d like see more interest in reducing the amount of food we throw away, not overbuying at the grocery store.\n\u201cIt\u2019s very empowering,\u201d said Lo, 44, a waste reduction and recycling specialist with Hennepin County\u2019s Department of Environmental Services.\nAnd if that blender or iPod really is kaput, \u201cat least now you can make a good decision about throwing it away.\u201d There\u2019s also info on drop-off sites for electronics recycling.\n\u201cEverybody has broken stuff, but we may not know how to fix it or what\u2019s needed, so we throw it away and buy new,\u201d Lo said.\nThere\u2019s just no reason we have to waste that much food.\u201dHer recycled profession has paid off in many ways."}
