The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) said on Sunday they are taking the warning from the hacking collective Anonymous seriously regarding a threat of attack by ISIS. The group released a statement the Islamic State terrorist group is planning to launch more attacks in Paris, the U.S., Indonesia, Italy and Lebanon on Sunday.

“We have … made the proper notifications as we continue to work closely with our law-enforcement and private-sector partners to keep our community safe,” the FBI said.

OpParisIntel, the Anonymous campaign against the Islamic State online, released a statement Saturday saying it had uncovered information regarding new terror plots “on Paris and the world” scheduled for Sunday Nov. 22.

The group also warned the Islamic State may be planning an attack at the WWE Survivor Series event set to take place in the Philips Area in Atlanta on Sunday night. The developments come after the Paris attacks last week and an announcement on Sunday from Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel, who said schools and subways will be closed due to a “serious and imminent” threat from the Islamic State and other Islamists.

Brussels is now on its second day under the highest threat level and the manhunt continues for a suspect missing since the Nov. 13 attacks in France. On Saturday, as PPD previously reported, the U.S. Embassy in Belgium issued a “shelter in place” order after local authorities raised the threat of an Islamic terror attack to imminent.

“We only take the responsibility of warning civilians (in case the authorities do not act well enough),” the hacker group’s statement read. “The goal is to make sure the whole world, or at least the people going to these events, know that there have been threats and that there is possibility of an attack to happen.

The statement suggested people reframe from attending events with large crowds, especially church services, which is antithetical to the message from Westerner leaders who argue citizens must go on with their lives as to not allow terrorists to terrorize. The statement also said “the risk of any churches outside Paris/France being targeted is low.”

“Another goal is to make sure Daesh knows that the world knows and cancels the attacks, which will disorientate them for a while.”

The group published a list of potential targets, including:

-Cigales Electroniques with Vocodecks, RE-Play & Rawtor at Le Bizen (Paris)

-Concrete Invites Drumcode: Adam Beyer, Alan Fitzpatrick, Joel Mull at Concrete (Paris)

-Demonstration by Collectif du Droit des Femmes (Paris)

-Feast of Christ the King celebrations (Rome/Worldwide)

-Al-Jihad, One Day One Juz (Indonesia)

-Five Finger Death Punch (Milan)

-University Pastoral Day (Holy Spirit University of Kaslik, Lebanon)
