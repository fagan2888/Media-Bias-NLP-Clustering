State Sen. Dan Hughes wrapped up his first short session at the state capitol recently and found success with the majority of the legislation he introduced. Sen. Hughes introduced six bills during the session and indicated four of them passed, with one dying in committee and one on the legislative floor.\n\nSen. Hughes recapped the session to a crowd of more than two-dozen gathered at the Bieroc Cafe Thursday morning. He credited his success to working ahead, behind the scenes, talking to colleagues and making sure they understood the issues.\n\nA bill authorizing the use of sales tax to construct workforce housing, LB 860, found success by being rolled into another bill. Sen. Hughes said the legislation would allow municipalities to construct middle value homes with sales tax revenue.\n\nSen. Hughes was also behind LB 1038A, which appropriates $1 million from the general fund to the Department of Agriculture to fund a bill introduced by Sen. Al Davis which is intended to help address invasive species of plants in river basins. \"That's pretty significant,\" said Hughes.\n\nA hazing bill stemming from a 2015 incident at Cambridge High School, which Hughes said previously was designed to protect younger Nebraskans, also passed. The bill, LB 710, expands state hazing statutes to the high school level.\n\nOther legislation introduced by Sen. Hughes targeted technical changes to how the State Fire Marshall Agency operates. He said the bill, LB 712, was similar to a lot of other bills introduced, intended to allow government to operate more efficiently, \"not just creating new laws.\"\n\nSen. Hughes reiterated comments made previously that he and several other senators would be working over the summer to develop property tax relief options. He indicated sales tax exemptions would likely be examined closely and said we have exemptions for more than half of what we pay in sales tax.\n\nHe said the state received approximately $133 million in property taxes, that should have come from sales and income taxes, under today's TEEOSA school funding formula. He said the formula didn't anticipate such a huge run-up in agriculture land values.\n\n\"To me it's indicative the formula is flawed. We need to have a serious look at how we tax in Nebraska,\" said Hughes.\n\nMcCook Community College Vice-President Andy Long spoke in support of Medicaid expansion at the state level during Thursday's meeting, saying to him it just made sense.\n\nSen. Hughes said he was against previous efforts but was sure it would be brought back again. He indicated the upcoming presidential election would likely impact the Affordable Care Act, one way or another, and also help shape the future of the Medicaid expansion debate.\n\nSen. Hughes indicated funding for Medicaid expansion at the state level, tied to previous introduced legislation, wasn't sustainable and the number of those in rural Nebraska impacted was minimal.\n\n\"I don't know if it's that big of an issue in rural Nebraska,\" he said.\n\nWEC expansion is still being mentioned during discussions related to the long-term plans for the Department of Corrections, according to Hughes. He said the McCook facility had recreational and classroom needs that would likely be prioritized.\n\nSen. Hughes said the shorter 60-day session was more intense than last year's 90-day session, his first as a Senator. Legislative bills not acted on are also not carried over, like they would be during the longer session, which he said added to the dynamic.\n\nDespite the shorter session legislators still have plenty of time, according to Hughes, he estimated 15 days could have been cut from the session and the same amount of work accomplished.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.mccookgazette.com/story/2301026.html", "type": "article", "site_name": "McCook Gazette", "description": "McCOOK, Neb. -- District 44.
