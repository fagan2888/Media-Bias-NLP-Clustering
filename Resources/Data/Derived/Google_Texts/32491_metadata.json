Job gains for the previous two months were revised up by 44,000.\n\nInspiring even more good cheer, however, is news that average hourly earnings for private nonfarm payrolls actually rose 9 cents last month.\n\nThe Good News in November\u2019s Report\n\nFor months, stagnant wage growth has muted excitement about strong job growth. Wages rose an average of 2.1 percent over the year, barely above inflation. The strain that\u2019s had on workers\u2019 pocketbooks helps explain some of the disconnect between impressive economic figures and many Americans\u2019 economic malaise.\n\nAs with all month-to-month government figures, however, one month\u2019s spike is typically suspect and it will take a longer-term trend to make the optimism stick. Left-leaning economist Dean Baker, director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research, argues that this month\u2019s 9 cent/hour growth (and 4 cents for private-sector production and nonsupervisory employees) simply makes up for poor wage growth in the previous two months and that the three-month average is still too low.\n\nWage growth was much stronger in November\u2013which is very good sign. But some perspective is important. pic.twitter.com/G4etc7ivWw \u2014 Ben Casselman (@bencasselman) December 5, 2014\n\nBut there was other good news. The average workweek for private nonfarm payrolls increased by 0.1 hour to 34.6 hours and by 0.2 hour in manufacturing, potentially increasing workers\u2019 earning potential. Factory overtime hours also increased. Job growth was broadly based across all industries, too, although the highest gains remain in professional and business services.\n\nMaking Sen$e\u2019s \u201cSolman Scale U7\u201d metric of unemployment, which adds to the officially unemployed part-timers looking for full-time work and \u201cdiscouraged\u201d workers, decreased to a record low since we started calculating it in 2011 \u2014 13.73 percent.\n\nInvoluntary part-time workers decreased \u2014 by about 200,000; these are workers who are working part-time jobs because they can\u2019t find full-time work, and their elevated numbers have been a consistent dark spot in employment reports during the recovery. There are still some 6.7 million involuntary part-timers.\n\nWe explored the underreporting of part-time workers last month when we discovered that people who work 35 hours or more at multiple part-time gigs are actually counted as full-time workers because of their total hours clocked. Furthermore, the headline number of jobs added does not distinguish between full and part-timers. \u201cSo if you\u2019re on for an hour,\u201d the Peterson Institute\u2019s Justin Wolfers told us in November, \u201cyou\u2019re counted as having a job.\u201d Most job gains, however, have been full-time.\n\nVirtually all the job growth in the recovery has come in full-time jobs. pic.twitter.com/3wTKGcuBaS \u2014 Ben Casselman (@bencasselman) December 5, 2014\n\nThe trend of voluntary part-timers is a different story. Their numbers have risen \u2014 by almost 300,000 from October to November alone. To Baker, that\u2019s good news, too, because it signifies that people who were working full-time just for the sake of having health insurance through their employer are now able to work the hours they want to work while obtaining coverage through exchanges. A victory for the Affordable Care Act, he thinks.\n\nIt\u2019s Not Enough\n\nThe number that hasn\u2019t budged, though, is the labor force participation rate, holding at about 62.8 percent all year. In October, some 92 million people were not in the labor force, which also means that they weren\u2019t counted as officially unemployed because they weren\u2019t actively looking for a job. Even when adjusting labor force departures for demographic trends (baby boomer retirement, for example), there aren\u2019t enough jobs, says Baker, for all the people who still need one.\n\nConservative economist Michael Strain of the American Enterprise Institute agreed with some of Baker\u2019s concerns about persistent weak spots in the labor market.\n\nLittle change in\u2026 # of long-term unemployed Labor force part. Employment rate Involuntary part-time workers Marginally attached workers \u2014 Michael R. Strain (@MichaelRStrain) December 5, 2014\n\nHow Did We Get to 321,000?\n\nBut the number that shocked and awed this morning was 321,000 jobs. Given the volatility of all monthly data, however, and the fact that the Bureau of Labor Statistics conducts two separate surveys that paint often contrasting pictures of the labor market, a little more explication of the employment situation is in order.\n\nConsider this: The survey of 60,000 individual households (on which the unemployment rate figure is based) paints a much weaker portrait of November\u2019s job gains. It says only 4,000 more people were employed in November. But what about those 321,000 jobs?\n\nThe larger figure comes from a different and, many economists argue, more reliable survey of employers. Baker puts almost all of his stock in the employer survey, as does Wolfers, who weighs the employer survey about 80 percent and the household survey 20 percent. The BLS also encourages looking at the payroll survey for the most accurate estimate of jobs.\n\nBut if the household survey reflects conversations with actual workers, why is it less reliable? One reason is that it often shows big swings from month to month. In October, the same survey said 683,000 more people were employed \u2014 that doesn\u2019t even compare to the 4,000 it showed for November. There\u2019s no way either of those are true, Baker says. \u201cYou find often very crazy numbers that clearly didn\u2019t happen in the world\u201d in that survey, he adds.\n\nThe employer survey is less volatile in part because it\u2019s a bigger sample. (The much smaller household survey has a month-to-month sampling error four times that of the payroll survey.) And not only is the employer survey sample bigger (144,000 business and government agencies representing 554,000 establishments), but when the BLS makes contact with one employer, they\u2019re also finding out data about many employees; its reach is far wider.\n\nComparing Apples to Oranges\n\nThere are also minor differences in how the data for each survey are collected. For starters, the household survey is more inclusive of different kinds of employment situations, counting self-employed workers, unpaid family workers, agricultural workers and private household workers.\n\nWhen the BLS asks households about their employment status, they want to know whether individuals were employed during the calendar week that includes the 12th of the month, called the reference week. Surveying employers, the BLS is interested in how many people were employed during the pay period that includes the 12th of the month, and that pay period could be weekly, biweekly or monthly. Theoretically, then, Baker explains, someone could have been counted as employed in that payroll pay period, but tell a surveyor they\u2019d been laid off during the reference week in the household survey.\n\nLikewise, the household survey counts employees who are absent from work without pay \u2014 perhaps on extended disability or maternity leave \u2014 whereas the payroll survey does not.\n\nThe two surveys really are apples to oranges; one looks at people, the other looks at jobs, and that will always be a source of discrepancy. For example, as the BLS points out, it\u2019s possible that a person who changed jobs could be on two different employers\u2019 payrolls during the same reference week. That would count as two jobs, whereas in the household survey, this person would, of course, only identify as having one job.\n\nEven when Americans do work multiple jobs, they\u2019re only counted as having one job in the household survey. They either have a job or they don\u2019t. In the employer survey though, each of those nonfarm payroll positions would be a unique job.\n\nWhat both surveys have in common, though, is sampling error, and although one survey\u2019s is bigger than the others, it\u2019s a reminder that taking any one month\u2019s figures too seriously is an economics faux pas. To be statistically significant, the household survey has to show changes of plus or minus 436,000 employed people, and the employer survey has to show movement of plus or minus 94,000 jobs. That introduces a lot of variance. Add or subtract those figures from Friday\u2019s reported numbers, and you\u2019ll see how easily one month\u2019s good news can become bad news or vice versa.\n\nKeep Your Eyes on Payrolls\n\nThe bottom line here is that data between months is noisy. And the takeaway is that when you want to know what happened to employment, look at the payroll survey.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Friday's jobs report showed a surprisingly high 321,000 jobs were added in November.
