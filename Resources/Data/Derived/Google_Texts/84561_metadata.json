The Air Force will fully support the GAO's independent process. Once resolved, we look forward to proceeding with the development and fielding of the LRS-B aircraft.\u201d\n\nThe protest, which GAO has 100 days to adjudicate, was expected by industry observers and the Defense Department, in part because of the bomber\u2019s price tag, which is estimated to come in above $100 billion over the next few decades.\n\nThere\u2019s no way of knowing how much of a case the Lockheed-Boeing team has against Northrop because so many details about the new bomber program remain top secret. And the Air Force wasn\u2019t exactly forthcoming about why it had picked Northrop when it announced the award in a Pentagon press briefing last month.\n\nRelated: The Pentagon\u2019s New Bomber Faces a Potentially Costly Delay\n\nLooking at both proposals, the effort\u2019s selection team came to the conclusion that the Northrop bid \u201cwas the best value for the war fighter and the taxpayer, and we're not going into any other details relative to what those source selection criteria were,\u201d William LaPlante, assistant secretary of the Air Force for acquisitions, said at the time.\n\nIt\u2019s also unclear how much of an impact the work-stop order will have on the nascent program. Nearly $2 billion was appropriated for the effort between fiscal 2011 and 2015.\n\nSpeaking at the Pentagon briefing, Lt. Gen. Arnold Bunch, LaPlante\u2019s military deputy, said if the program \u201cwere to go to the GAO there's a 100-day timeframe for that, and we'll monitor and we won't stipulate or make any assumptions as to what the ramifications of that would be.\u201d\n\nThe protest and resulting halt puts the Air Force\u2019s weapons-buying policies under the microscope once again. The service has a bad track record of managing big-ticket items, such as the KC-46A Tanker and the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter.\n\nRelated: Air Force Gets Wrong Price Tag for New, Budget-Busting Bomber\n\nThe fighter is years behind schedule and plagued with cost overruns and technical glitches. The effort has cost around $400 billion to date, making it the most expensive weapons program in U.S. history. The fighter program is expected to cost more than $1 trillion over its lifetime.\n\nFor now, even one of the Air Force\u2019s chief critics is willing to give the service and the GAO time to sort out the protest.\n\n\u201cI think everybody expected a challenge on a weapons system of this magnitude but I\u2019m sorry, that\u2019s their right,\u201d Senate Armed Services Committee chair John McCain (R-AZ) told The Fiscal Times.\n\nAir Force leaders are confident the protest won\u2019t overturn the award, which would be a major embarrassment.\n\n\u201cI am confident that we collectively \u2014 and again, 'we' the Air Force, but we had independent peer reviews, as well \u2014 that, collectively, we did a very thorough job,\u201d Air Force Secretary Deborah Lee James said during a Nov. 10 press conference at the Dubai Air Show, according to Defense News.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Work on the U.S. Air Force\u2019s new, budget-busting Long Range Strike-Bomber has come to a complete halt, following a protest by the industry team that lost out on the highly-lucrative contract award.", "title": "Why the Air Force\u2019s $100 Billion Bomber Program Has Come to a Halt", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/11/10/Why-Air-Force-s-100-Billion-Bomber-Program-Has-Come-Halt", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/635570048174454101-AIR-BTN-New-bomber.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/11/10/Why-Air-Force-s-100-Billion-Bomber-Program-Has-Come-Halt", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/635570048174454101-AIR-BTN-New-bomber.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Work on the U.S. Air Force\u2019s new, budget-busting Long Range Strike-Bomber has come to a complete halt, following a protest by the industry team that lost out on the highly-lucrative contract award.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdbce2\"", "article_summary": "\u201cI am confident that we collectively \u2014 and again, 'we' the Air Force, but we had independent peer reviews, as well \u2014 that, collectively, we did a very thorough job,\u201d Air Force Secretary Deborah Lee James said during a Nov. 10 press conference at the Dubai Air Show, according to Defense News.\nAir Force leaders are confident the protest won\u2019t overturn the award, which would be a major embarrassment.\nWork on the Air Force\u2019s new Long Range Strike Bomber has come to a halt following a protest by the team that lost out on the massive contract.\nThe Air Force will fully support the GAO's independent process.\nRelated: Air Force Gets Wrong Price Tag for New, Budget-Busting BomberThe fighter is years behind schedule and plagued with cost overruns and technical glitches."}
