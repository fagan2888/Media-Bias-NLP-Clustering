Via someone on Twitter whose name I can't quite dig up from my memory banks, today's chart of the day follows the declining appreciation of dreary execution relative to showy strategery over the past half century. This happens to be a pet issue of mine, and it also seems apropos in light of the Obamacare website fiasco. Always remember: amateurs talk strategy; professionals talk logistics.

POSTSCRIPT: This chart is, of course, meaningless since both words have multiple meanings. That's OK. Don't go all OCD on me. Just savor the alleged cultural evolution and add some humorous and/or bitter observations about it in comments.
