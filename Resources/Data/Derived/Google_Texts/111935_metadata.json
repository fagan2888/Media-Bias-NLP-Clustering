Those who haven\u2019t prepared for the radical format transition are exhaling contentedly, while those who have worked furiously to make the deadline are understandably indignant about the delay.\n\nWith a stroke of his pen, President Obama authorized yet another implementation deferment to the ICD-10 coding system after the Senate approved the measure as part of the Sustainable Growth Rate \u201cdoc fix\u201d legislation on April 1. The ICD-10 delay is a late add-on item to HR 4302, initially drafted to stall a 24 percent Medicare reimbursement cut to physicians for one year.\n\nWhile there is really no way of knowing how many providers are in a position to make the ICD-10 conversion, forwarding the Oct. 1, 2014 implementation date to next year after several false starts has caught many off guard, including Mike Lovett, executive vice president and general manager of Horsham, Pa.-based NextGen.\n\n\u201cIt definitely came as a surprise \u2013 everyone I\u2019ve spoken to has said another delay would not happen,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not sure what happened or how it even got on [legislators'] radar.\u201d\n\nLovett acknowledges that some providers are behind in gearing up for the ICD-10 shift, but also exudes frustration that his clients now have to hurry up and wait.\n\n\u201cThis rewards those who weren\u2019t organized,\u201d he said. \u201cIt lets them off the hook.\u201d\n\nTo be sure, NextGen and its clients \u201cput a lot of work\u201d into getting ready and the delay \u201conly clouds over what has to happen,\u201d Lovett said. \u201cNow we\u2019re looking at spending more on education.\u201d\n\nThe EHR Association's comment was neutral regarding the ICD-10 delay, focusing instead on the SGR fix.\n\n\"Vendors have been working to support our clients, including providers, hospitals, ACOs and other stakeholders, through the transition to ICD-10,\" said EHR Association Chair Mickey McGlynn, of Siemens. \"The EHR Association is concerned that this proposed legislation further delays a permanent fix to the SGR formula payment system, which we view as integral to moving toward a value-based payment system.\"\n\n'Unfortunate\u2019 situation\n\nWatertown, Mass.-based athenahealth is also dismayed at the delay, with Ed Park executive vice president and COO calling it an \u201cunfortunate\u201d situation.\n\n\u201cIt is alarmingly clear that healthcare is operating in an environment where there is no penalty for not being able to keep pace with necessary steps and deadlines to move the industry forward,\u201d he said. \u201cOur system is already woefully behind in embracing technology to drive information quality, data exchange and efficiency, and delays like this only hinder us further.\u201d\n\nPark sees instability within the provider sector regarding ICD-10 and calls legislators\u2019 actions \u201ca significant distraction to providers and inappropriately invokes massive additional investments of time and money for all. The issue is even more serious when considered in association with another short-term SGR fix and 2013\u2019s meaningful use Stage 2 delay.\u201d\n\nChris Powell, president of Wayne, Pa.-based Precyse also sees the postponement as a negative.\n\n\u201cWe are disappointed as our clients have spent considerable time and resources ensuring preparedness for Oct. 1, 2014,\u201d he said.\n\nEven so, Powell said the decision strengthens his resolve to continue on the course of helping providers position themselves for the transition when it finally comes.\n\n\u201cThis change cannot deter us from our goals to improve the overall level of clinical documentation that will in turn improve the quality of the data and drive delivery of the best healthcare in the world,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2018Breathing room\u2019\n\nThough these latest developments may cause consternation among those who dutifully followed preparation protocols, there is no doubt that others will appreciate the extra time, says Mike Nolte, COO of Atlanta-based MedAssets.\n\n\u201cA one-year delay provides welcome breathing room for some organizations coping with ongoing financial pressures and concurrent 2014 regulatory mandates, including complying with provisions of the Affordable Care Act and attestation for Stage 2 meaningful ose,\u201d he said. \u201cOur position is that adoption of ICD-10 remains a question of \u2018when\u2019 not \u2018if.\u2019 And we encourage our clients to proceed with plans and preparations in full force.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Healthcare industry response to yet another postponement of ICD-10 coding ranges from relief to resentment.
