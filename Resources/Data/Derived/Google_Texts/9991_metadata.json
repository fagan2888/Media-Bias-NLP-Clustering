Here\u2019s what life taught me in the second half.\n\nIn July, I learned that that the fleur-de-lis represents French pride, pineapples symbolize welcome, chevrons telegraph masculine dominance and rank, laurel wreaths are the sign of champions, and the ancient egg-and-dart motif means nothing less than life and death. Knowing what motifs mean matters. Using the right one in the right place separates the amateur decorator from the pro.\n\nLesson: Think twice before you wallpaper a baby girl\u2019s room in pink chevron-patterns, or put chairs covered in fleur-de-lis fabric in a Japanese tea room.\n\nIn August, I came to terms with my attachment issues. While clearing out my elderly parents\u2019 home, where they had lived for almost 50 nears, I let go of a lot of stuff. It felt like opening a vein. In the process, I came across an old brown crocodile purse my mother had kept tucked inside a red velvet drawstring bag, like a bottle of expensive liqueur. Inside, I found a brittle, folded-up menu from a big night mom had with my father, at a posh hotel in France decades earlier. It was a dinner she talked about for years. The butter came curled, she said. And they had escargot.\n\nThough tempted to cling, I looked again at the purse, too pass\u00e9 to be fashionable, the handle cracked with age. I asked myself why she saved it, why I should. She saved it, I realized, to remind her of her dashing younger life, and to show me who she once was. The purse had done just that. I let it go.\n\nLesson: Whether you keep an object or let it go won\u2019t change your connection to a loved one.\n\nIn September, I sent my youngest child off to college, and got predictably invested in her dorm d\u00e9cor. In a fit of mothering, I filled carts with bedbug-proof mattress protectors, extra-long twin sheets, and accessories to coordinate with her comforter. Back home reality hit: While I had created her nest, mine was as empty as a discarded eggshell.\n\nGrief expert Russell Friedman consoled me. \u201cThe definition of grief is the conflicting feelings caused by the end of or change in a familiar pattern or behavior,\u201d said Friedman, co-author of \u201cMoving On.\u201d\n\n\u201cAn empty nest is that and more,\u201d he said, then gave me this advice, and I am not making this up, I swear: \u201cRemodel.\u201d\n\nI perked up. \u201cI\u2019m great at that,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cOnly this time,\u201d he said, \u201cthe remodeling is of your heart, your head, and, to a lesser degree, your home.\u201d\n\nLesson: The job of the empty nester is to ask: Who am I now? Then think about how her home can reflect that. Maybe that playroom becomes an art studio?\n\nIn October, I spoke with someone who looks at real estate from the left, logical side of the brain, not the right, emotional one, which I use. Patrick Bet-David, a California-based financial adviser, is to the romantic notion of home ownership what sunshine is to fog.\n\n\u201cI was sold an American dream,\u201d said Bet-David, 34, who immigrated from Iran 23 years ago. But the dream of owning a home was one he was willing to wait for. He rents.\n\n\u201cBut being a tenant just isn\u2019t the same,\u201d I said. \u201cYou can\u2019t paint or plant or plaster the way you want.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut you can be nimble,\u201d he said.\n\nHis advice: Don\u2019t buy a house unless you have 12 months of house payments saved, and you plan to stay 10 years.\n\nLesson: \u201cMy message isn\u2019t don\u2019t buy a home,\u201d said Bet-David, who\u2019s buying his first home next month.\n\n\u201cMy message is the American dream is not home ownership. The American dream is freedom.\u201d\n\nIn November, I toured the home of the future, a home so smart it tells you when you\u2019re being stupid. The smart home helps you eat right, exercise and take better care of yourself. \u201cHealth starts at home,\u201d said Michael Voll, of Dais Technologies, the company behind many of the smart features of the Intelligent Home, in Lake Nona, Fla.\n\nIn the kitchen, digital technology prompts healthy food choices and easy meals. In the master, an interactive mirror relays your weight, BMI, blood pressure, hydration level, and a little tough love: \u201cMarni, you\u2019re up 2 pounds, better hit the treadmill.\u201d\n\nWhile I\u2019m not sure I want my freezer telling me to drop that pint of ice cream I\u2019m going for, on the other hand, this is just the kind of house America needs.\n\nLesson: Home technology will soon play a much larger role in helping us be healthier.\n\nIn December, I talked to homeowners who were downsizing up. They\u2019re moving into smaller homes to have bigger lives. Lori Brown, 55, of Chicago, said good-bye to her 4,000- square-foot home in a lovely suburb, to move to a smaller luxury condo. \u201cWe\u2019re excited,\u201d said Brown, who\u2019s looking forward to urban living. \u201cBefore, when I thought of people downsizing, I\u2019d think they were compromising, but that\u2019s not it at all. We\u2019re making an upgrade.\u201d\n\nLesson: Dream, plan, do. That\u2019s my plan \u2014 and my wish for you \u2014 in 2014.\n\nSyndicated columnist and speaker Marni Jameson is the author of \u201cHouse of Havoc\u201d and \u201cThe House Always Wins\u201d (Da Capo Press).
