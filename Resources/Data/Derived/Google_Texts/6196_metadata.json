(Photo: Milt Savage photo)Buy Photo Story Highlights The River Run Boat Dockin\u2019 Contest is a boisterous celebration of watermen culture.\n\nThe Salisbury contest is part of a circuit of events across the Eastern Shore.\n\nBoats compete to see who can pull in and tie up the fastest.\n\nAlaska races sled dogs. Wisconsin throws cow chips. Delaware chunks \u201cpunkins.\u201d\n\nMeet the Eastern Shore of Maryland\u2019s entr\u00e9e into the world of unusual sports: boat docking.\n\nOver four decades, it has grown from a curiosity during the annual National Hard Crab Derby in Crisfield into a full-fledged regional activity.\n\nIn its seventh year, the River Run Boat Dockin\u2019 Contest on the Wicomico River in Salisbury has distinguished itself as one of the best places on the circuit to get an up-close view of the action.\n\nThe competition plays out around the dock bar at Brew River Restaurant. And don\u2019t let the name fool you: There\u2019s nothing slow about the way these drivers dock their boats.\n\n\u201cI hold my breath and say a prayer\u201d every time one of the boats swings past the bar, says Wes Hanna, the restaurant\u2019s owner.\n\nFor the uninitiated, Hanna offers this description of the sport: \u201cIt\u2019s how fast you can dock your boat, which is hard enough when you\u2019re doing it slow.\u201d\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a deeper meaning, enthusiasts say the contests pay tribute to the rapidly disappearing culture of Chesapeake watermen.\n\n\u201cThese guys are blue-collar, hard workers, but they\u2019re extremely skilled at what they do,\u201d Hanna said.\n\nHere\u2019s how it goes down: In separate classes, crews of small boats and big boats must dock and tie up their boats on all four posts. A final shootout round determines the winners.\n\nFestivities get underway Friday, with the Captain\u2019s Party at Brew River, which features practice runs and live music starting at 5 p.m.\n\nThe official contest begins at 1 p.m. Saturday. Doors open at 11 a.m. An after-party and live music follow.\n\njcox6@dmg.gannett.com\n\n410-845-4630\n\nOn Twitter @Jeremy_Cox\n\nIF YOU GO\n\nSEVENTH ANNUAL RIVER RUN BOAT DOCKIN' CONTEST\n\nWhen: 1 p.m. Saturday, Sept. 6, (doors at 11 a.m.)\n\nWhere: Brew River, Salisbury\n\nCost: $10 adults, $5 children 8 and under\n\nCall: 410-677-6757\n\nWeb: brewriver.com\n\nRead or Share this story: http://www.delmarvanow.com/story/entertainment/culture/2014/09/01/brew-river-boat-dockin-watermen/14816187/", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Spectators can watch the boats from a dock bar in the middle of the action.", "og": {"site_name": "Delmarva Daily Times", "description": "Spectators can watch the boats from a dock bar in the middle of the action.", "title": "Brew River to host 7th annual boat dockin\u2019", "url": "http://www.delmarvanow.com/story/entertainment/culture/2014/09/01/brew-river-boat-dockin-watermen/14816187/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/delmarvanow.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Spectators can watch the boats from a dock bar in the middle of the action.", "creator": "@MyDelmarvaNow", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/2bf845856a16b1964f62c46453d5983fbcc8ed88/c=0-0-1216-1216&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/Salisbury/2014/08/29/-ms1-boat.dock-21.jpg20120908.jpg", "title": "Brew River to host 7th annual boat dockin\u2019", "site": "@MyDelmarvaNow", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=858745131", "fb": {"app_id": 179822335370394}, "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/dtreporterjeremycox"}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": "River Run Boat Dockin\u2019 Contest, Brew River, Salisbury, Maryland"}, "article_summary": "(Photo: Milt Savage photo)Buy Photo Story Highlights The River Run Boat Dockin\u2019 Contest is a boisterous celebration of watermen culture.\njcox6@dmg.gannett.com410-845-4630On Twitter @Jeremy_CoxIF YOU GOSEVENTH ANNUAL RIVER RUN BOAT DOCKIN' CONTESTWhen: 1 p.m. Saturday, Sept. 6, (doors at 11 a.m.)Where: Brew River, SalisburyCost: $10 adults, $5 children 8 and underCall: 410-677-6757Web: brewriver.comRead or Share this story: http://www.delmarvanow.com/story/entertainment/culture/2014/09/01/brew-river-boat-dockin-watermen/14816187/\nFestivities get underway Friday, with the Captain\u2019s Party at Brew River, which features practice runs and live music starting at 5 p.m.\nBuy Photo Benny Horseman, captain of the Tough Luck II, throws his last two lines for a winning time of 25.7 seconds in the Mystery Money Bag contest during the Fifth Annual River Run Boat Dockin' Contest at Brew River in Salisbury in 2012.\nIn its seventh year, the River Run Boat Dockin\u2019 Contest on the Wicomico River in Salisbury has distinguished itself as one of the best places on the circuit to get an up-close view of the action."}
