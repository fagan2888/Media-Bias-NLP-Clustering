But when gridlock becomes the norm the conflicts are endless, infinite, predictable and just plain dull: in a way, the opposite of news.\n\n\n\nThis dynamic has already ruined the Sunday talk shows. Who can stand that spectacle anymore?\n\nA recent task force of American Political Science Association put it this way:\n\nThe United States used to be viewed as a land of broad consensus and pragmatic politics in which sharp ideological differences were largely absent; yet, today, politics is dominated by intense party polarization and limited agreement among representatives on policy problems and solutions.\n\nIn a fascinating paper on \u201cphilanthropy in a time of polarization,\u201d three authors \u2014 Steven Teles, Heather Hurlburt and Mark Schmitt \u2014 take up the question. They point out that leaders in these grantmaking foundations operate from assumptions that extreme polarization can be overpowered by \u201cstrong ideas and persuasive research\u2026[that] will motivate elected officials\u201d to act. They believe in the message of bipartisanship and urge foundations to \u201cstay above the political fray.\u201d\n\nThe way Obama\u2019s health care reform became law shredded that script. Elites in Washington believed that a compromise would emerge by \u201ccombining a broad goal favored by liberals with ideas traditionally supported by conservatives.\u201d Nothing like that went down. One side passed the bill. The other demonized it and continues the fight to this day. Teles, Hurlburt and Schmitt write:\n\nFoundations have traditionally seen themselves as part of civil society \u2013 as mediating institutions that form a bridge between dispassionate knowledge and political advocacy. Their resources, many in the sector have hoped, could fund objective, nonpartisan research that would take the edge off partisan conflicts and pave the way for broadly accepted social progress.\n\nThat view of American politics no longer makes sense. Nothing has taken the edge off partisan warfare, least of all \u201cobjective, nonpartisan research.\"\n\nIs \u2018objectivity\u2019 in journalism dead ?\n\nIt\u2019s tricky to compare foundation officers and journalists because officially the mainstream press has no theory of change, no policy agenda \u2013 indeed, no politics at all. Officially, journalists are merely out to get the story, tell the truth, inform us about what\u2019s going on, and in special circumstances share their opinion.\n\nBut anyone who observes its work cannot help but notice that the Washington press corps shares a certain world view, analogous in many ways to the typical foundation officer\u2019s. (Steve Coll moved easily from the Washington Post to the New America Foundation and on to the deanship of Columbia Journalism School. Walter Isaacson editor of Time magazine, CEO of CNN, is now president of the Aspen Institute.)\n\nHere are some of the components of this shared world view. Recognize them?\n\n\u201cSuccessful candidates move to the middle\u2026\u201d\n\nPoliticians who know how to get things done cut deals among insiders on both sides of the aisle. (Ronald Reagan working with Tip O\u2019Neill is the usual reference point.)\n\nTo \u201ccede the ideological center\u201d is the political mistake par excellence.\n\nReuters\n\nAnd as Thomas E. Mann and Norman J. Ornstein wrote in the Washington Post:\n\n\u2018Both sides do it\u2019 or \u2018There is plenty of blame to go around\u2019 are the traditional refuges for an American news media intent on proving its lack of bias.\n\nWhat if the ideological center is effectively gone? What if striking deals with insiders from both parties no longer describes the way world works? For as authors Teles, Hurlburt and Schmitt put it: \u201cPundits who say that \u2018nothing can get done without bipartisan support\u2019 no longer have the evidence on their side.\u201d\n\nWhat are the options?\n\nUnder these conditions, political journalists have a choice. They can try to muddle through with the framework they had before extreme polarization became too obvious to ignore. If they take this route, they will write well-informed articles about the trend. They will report the data about polarization without drawing any conclusions about their own practices. Or, they can recognize that they too have a world view, and that its assumptions have gone bust.\n\nIf they choose the latter, what then?\n\nInstead of trying to stay in the middle between polarized extremes and avoid criticism, political journalists and their bosses could recognize that there is no escape from charges of bias because these charges are just a further aspect of polarization. If you\u2019re going to be attacked anyway, might as well let it rip.\n\nThat\u2019s what the Washington Post did when earlier this month it hired Chris Mooney to cover the environment in blog form. Mooney is the author of two books \u2014 The Republican War on Science and The Republican Brain (subtitle: The Science of Why They Deny Science \u2013 and Reality) \u2014 that leave no doubt about where he stands.\n\n\n\nIn announcing his appointment, the Post described Mooney as a writer with a distinctive voice and a consistent argument: \u201cthat people\u2019s preconceptions \u2013 political, religious, cultural \u2013 color the way they view science.\u201d\n\nBeing transparent about point of view is the honest approach for reporters\n\nNewsrooms are better off with reporters who know their beats, nail their arguments, make clear where they\u2019re coming from and meet high standards of verification, always. Intellectual honesty is a more reliable basis for trust than a ritualized objectivity. A clear voice is more valuable than a nonpartisan veneer.\n\nCalling out falsehoods that have gotten traction is another thing journalists can do once they realize that extreme polarization is a feature, not a bug. Ever since the fact-checking site, Politifact, won the Pulitzer Prize for \u201cseparating rhetoric from truth to enlighten voters,\u201d fact checking has become routine in the coverage of politics. Now the press needs to take the next step: identify the worst offenders, deny them respectability and platform, raise the cost in reputation for relying on falsehoods: in a word, fight. \u201cDetached from the partisan fray\u201d won\u2019t cut it.\n\nThe non-profit investigative newsroom, ProPublica.org, calls what it does \u201caccountability journalism.\u201d It is the only kind of journalism ProPublica is interested in doing. Here\u2019s how they describe it:\n\nOur work focuses exclusively on truly important stories, stories with \u2018moral force.\u2019 We do this by producing journalism that shines a light on exploitation of the weak by the strong and on the failures of those with power to vindicate the trust placed in them.\n\nThat is a view of the world as strong as polarization is deep. Political journalists need to adopt a similar view or they will slide into irrelevance. There is one other option: savvy analysts of the game. Winners and losers, who\u2019s up, who\u2019s down, strategy and tactics. That really isn\u2019t journalism, though. It\u2019s scorekeeping.\n\nJay Rosen, Associate Professor, Arthur L.
