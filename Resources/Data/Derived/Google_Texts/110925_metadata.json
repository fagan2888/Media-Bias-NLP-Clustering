The devices, despite some enhanced features, failed to truly wow gadget geeks. Many of the details about the phones had leaked out or been rumored for months, leaving few surprises for Tuesday\u2019s presentation. At the same time, the strategy behind the new devices failed to impress many analysts \u2013 who were surprised, unpleasantly, by the pricing of the iPhone 5C.\n\nWall Street Bought the Rumor, Sold the News\n\nApple\u2019s share price had climbed nearly 30 percent since late June, helped by anticipation for its new releases \u2013 and a pair of tweets from Carl Icahn last month in which the activist investor revealed he had taken \u201ca large position\u201d in the stock and was pushing the company to buy back more shares. That investor optimism faded quickly once the new devices were announced. Analysts at Bank of America, Credit Suisse, J.P. Morgan and UBS all downgraded the stock, which plunged about 5 percent Wednesday, adding to a 2 percent slide on Tuesday. The stock, which had broken back above $500 in recent weeks, had fallen back to $470.\n\nSo the \u2018C\u2019 Doesn\u2019t Stand for Cheap\n\nThe slew of downgrades came, in large part, in response to the pricing of the colorful new polycarbonate-backed iPhone 5C. In the U.S., Apple will sell 16GB versions of the devices for $549 and 32GB versions for $649 to customers who don\u2019t sign a service contract with a wireless carrier. Those prices are just $100 less than the supposedly high-end iPhone 5S \u2013 and they\u2019re far higher than the $400 or so that many on Wall Street were expecting if Apple was really going to make a push to grow its presence in China and other emerging markets. \u201cSo much for the low end,\u201d Credit Suisse analysts wrote on Wednesday, while also noting that the specs of Apple\u2019s new phones are \u201cnot quite on par\u201d with high-end competitors.\n\nAnd It Doesn\u2019t Stand for China, Either\n\nApple did announce that it had gotten approval to run its devices on China Mobile\u2019s network, potentially allowing it to reach the carrier\u2019s 700 million subscribers. Yet it didn\u2019t announce a formal deal with China Mobile to start selling its phones right away, and given its iPhone 5C pricing, UBS analyst Steven Milunovich said that Apple could struggle to make gains against much cheaper Android phones in China even once it does land that deal.\n\nMilunovich noted that the 5C prices could cut into sales of the 5S rather than expand Apple\u2019s appeal to lower-end buyers. \u201cThose prices would appear to maximize the risk of cannibalization and minimize emerging market penetration,\u201d Milunovich wrote in downgrading Apple from Buy to Neutral. \u201cApple seems to be protecting its premium brand and margins at the expense of market share.\u201d Steve Jobs may be gone, but his pricing playbook for Apple lives on.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Apple\u2019s two new iPhones, announced to much fanfare Tuesday, have landed with a bit of a thud.
