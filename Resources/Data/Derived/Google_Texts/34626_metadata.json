But America\u2019s business community, typically a crucial pillar of support for Republicans, still is not convinced.\n\nAt best, many Wall Street executives and business leaders are befuddled by what policies a President Trump would pursue because the candidate has outlined few specific proposals or named few advisers in key areas.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt worst, they fear the economic consequences of Trump\u2019s brash rhetoric and pledges to scrap trade deals, deport millions of undocumented workers, and punish corporations that move operations outside the United States.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re looking at a Trump-Clinton election as probably not the best choice for anybody,\u201d said former House majority leader Eric Cantor, a Republican who is now vice chairman at investment bank Moelis & Co.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a businessman . . . [but] he\u2019s been on so many sides of every issue that you never know.\u201d\n\nThe rupture occurring within the Republican Party over Trump\u2019s stunning takeover is sending tremors through executive suites across the country.\n\nAfter bashing Wall Street and pushing a populist, antiestablishment theme throughout the primary, the presumptive GOP nominee has signaled in recent days that he\u2019s now ready to start courting America\u2019s corner offices for support and political cash for the general election ahead. But there are signs that support will not materialize, at least not to the extent it has for Mitt Romney, John McCain, and George W. Bush in past GOP campaigns.\n\nAFP/Getty Images/File 2014 Former House majority leader Eric Cantor.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump named a well-connected hedge-fund manager last week as his campaign finance chairman and announced that he will no longer almost exclusively self-fund his campaign.\n\nThe Trump campaign did not respond to requests to comment for this story.\n\nCantor said he will back Trump, despite disagreeing with much of what the candidate says, but other industry officials predict Trump will have a hard time attracting support from the financial sector \u2014 and he even risks losing support to Hillary Clinton. She was New York\u2019s senator for two terms, but her platform as a presidential candidate isn\u2019t particularly friendly to them.\n\n\u201cI think most Wall Street money will be with Hillary Clinton,\u201d said Brian Gardner, a Washington analyst with investment bank Keefe Bruyette & Woods Inc. \u201cThere are relationships there. There\u2019s familiarity. So even to the extent that some people on Wall Street don\u2019t support her policies, I think there\u2019s just a comfort level with her versus Donald Trump.\u201d\n\nThe GOP has long been the party of big business, despite some frayed ties amid the rise of the Tea Party movement.\n\nThe US Chamber of Commerce, the most powerful business lobby in town, doesn\u2019t endorse in presidential races but has spent tens of millions of dollars in key congressional races in recent cycles \u2014 almost entirely to benefit Republican candidates. Wall Street overwhelmingly favored Romney in the 2012 race.\n\nA broad defection of Wall Street and other business support to Clinton would be a major reversal from recent years \u2014 all the more notable as Clinton has been pushed to adopt a more populist tone by her Democratic rival Bernie Sanders.\n\nA decision by Republican-leaning executives to sit out this cycle could undercut Trump and the Republican National Committee\u2019s efforts to raise enough cash to compete.\n\nMore business leaders might yet embrace the bombastic billionaire \u2014 once the shell shock fades. A few major figures lined up behind Trump after he clinched the mantle of presumptive nominee. Casino mogul and GOP megadonor Sheldon Adelson said he would support Trump. So did Home Depot cofounder Ken Langone, who was supporting Governor John Kasich of Ohio in the primary season.\n\nStill, many in the financial sector are wary, insiders say.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no consistency of message,\u201d one financial executive said. \u201cNo one is in the know.\u201d\n\nThe Trump campaign has convened few meetings with executives or trade groups to discuss proposals. Nor has he named many policy advisers that would hint at the direction he would take in the Oval Office.\n\nOn the stump, he has said he wants to kill the 2010 Dodd-Frank law, the complex and sweeping response to the 2008 market meltdown. Much of the legislation is opposed by Wall Street\u2019s lobbyists in Washington. But Trump also spent the entire primary campaign slamming his opponents for maintaining ties to investment companies and big banks.\n\nTrump has bashed hedge fund managers as \u201cgetting away with murder\u201d for enjoying the so-called carried interest tax loophole, which allows them to pay a lower tax rate on income than the average worker. By wanting to trash the loophole, Trump is aligning himself with President Obama and the Democratic primary field \u2014 hardly a typical position for the GOP nominee.\n\nTrump hasn\u2019t actively sought money from Wall Street or elsewhere, largely self-funding his primary campaign. He\u2019s changing course now that he faces the prospect of a general election tab of $1 billion or more.\n\nJEFF SCHEID/LAS VEGAS REVIEW-JOURNAL/AP/FILE Casino mogul and Republican megadonor Sheldon Adelson said he would support Donald Trump.\n\nClinton is way ahead. Trump has raised only about $540,000 from the finance, insurance, and real estate sector, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonpartisan organization that tracks political money.\n\nClinton has raised more than $40 million from those industries. (Former Florida governor Jeb Bush still outpaces them all, having raised more than $68 million from the sector before he dropped out of the race.)\n\nOn Thursday, Trump named Goldman Sachs veteran Steven Mnuchin, chief executive of hedge fund Dune Capital Management LP, to be his national finance chairman. Mnuchin, who has done business with Trump, according to the campaign, \u201cbrings his expertise in finance to what will be an extremely successful fund-raising operation for the Republican Party.\u201d\n\nSome industry insiders believe many in the financial sector will keep their wallets closed.\n\nDespite his boasts of potent negotiating prowess, the real estate mogul\u2019s rhetoric makes buttoned-up business types nervous, industry officials say. Some of his positions \u2014 particularly on trade and immigration \u2014 run counter to Corporate America\u2019s agenda. His unscripted remarks also can cause heartburn.\n\nMost recently, Trump said he might try to get China and other US creditors to accept less than 100 cents on the dollar to cut the national debt during tough economic times. It\u2019s the kind of off-the-cuff statement that could seriously rattle financial markets if made by the commander in chief.\n\nBond market experts were aghast. The Clinton campaign seized on the comments as evidence of Trump\u2019s instability, putting out a statement from former Obama economic aide Gene Sperling saying Trump\u2019s suggestion amounted to embracing a possible default on the national debt.\n\n\u201cIt would risk a global financial meltdown, drive up interest rates for Americans for decades, and seriously harm middle-class families,\u201d Sperling said in the statement.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s preposterous,\u201d Cantor said of Trump\u2019s debt comments. Such remarks worry him, he said, but \u201cI attribute that to more of Donald Trump\u2019s rhetoric when he\u2019s in a campaign environment.\u201d\n\nOther Trump foes in the industry are less forgiving.\n\n\u201cEven if you suspect Trump might win, if you contribute to his campaign, you\u2019re buying a ticket on the crazy train,\u201d said Tony Fratto, a former Bush administration official and outspoken Trump critic, whose consulting firm Hamilton Place Strategies advises major financial firms.\n\nHe pointed to controversial Trump comments about women and minorities, among others. \u201cYou own everything that he does and says as long as he\u2019s a candidate. . . . That\u2019s an enormous risk.\u201d\n\nEven if the business elite in Manhattan office towers and Washington\u2019s K Street don\u2019t rally to Trump, his insurgent campaign could find allies on Main Street. Many small-business owners worry less about trade and immigration, and in some cases disagree with big business.\n\nLast month, the head of a major small-business trade group, Juanita Duggan, a former White House aide to presidents Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush, attended a meeting with Trump in Washington. She emerged from the meeting, where she presented her group\u2019s policy agenda, with a positive view of the presumptive GOP nominee.\n\n\u201cHe was very gracious, he asked very penetrating questions, and he has an excellent command of facts,\u201d Duggan said in an interview. \u201cHe was impressive.\u201d\n\nFor the 325,000 members of her group \u2014 the National Federation of Small Business \u2014 top concerns include taxes, over-regulation, and the Affordable Care Act, which the group sued to overturn in a case that the group ultimately lost before the Supreme Court. The positions Trump has sketched out in these areas \u201clook like they are headed in the right direction,\u201d such as his proposal to have a single flat business tax rate of 15 percent for big and small corporations, and a pledge to eliminate the estate tax, Duggan said.\n\n\u201cWe definitely would need more information about how this all fits together,\u201d she said, \u201cbut some of the top line things he\u2019s talked about are things that NFIB has been support[ive] of for years, decades.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"eomportal-loid": "4.1.3603525852", "eomportal-id": 418703, "description": "Trump will have a difficult time persuading industry to back him, some industry officials said, and he risks losing support to Hillary Clinton.", "eomportal-instanceid": 16, "og": {"city": "Washington", "site_name": "BostonGlobe.com", "description": "Trump will have a difficult time persuading industry to back him, some industry officials said, and he risks losing support to Hillary Clinton.", "title": "Wall Street befuddled, alarmed by Donald Trump and may turn to Democratic ticket - The Boston Globe", "url": "https://www.bostonglobe.com/news/politics/2016/05/08/wall-street-befuddled-alarmed-donald-trump-and-may-turn-democratic-ticket/T1o4HZYA8pryPuMmxz71xJ/story.html", "image": "http://c.o0bg.com/rf/image_585w/Boston/2011-2020/2016/05/06/BostonGlobe.com/National/Images/21c1e430a64548f49b422e7033fee5d0-a606bc0920144f36b7c0a54c286d947a-0.jpg", "state": "DC", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"account_id": 95431448, "card": "summary", "site": "BostonGlobe"}, "robots": "noarchive", "news_keywords": "Donald Trump,Wall Street,Hillary Clinton,Eric Cantor, Donald J Trump, Hillary Rodham  Clinton, Eric  Cantor, Mitt  Romney, John  McCain, George W  Bush", "eomportal-lastUpdate": "Thu May 26 18:32:17 EDT 2016", "fb": {"admins": 507486035, "app_id": 103933749691726, "pages": 5637143257}, "keywords": "Donald Trump,Wall Street,Hillary Clinton,Eric Cantor, Donald J Trump, Hillary Rodham  Clinton, Eric  Cantor, Mitt  Romney, John  McCain, George W  Bush, Bernard  Sanders, Sheldon G  Adelson, Barack  Obama, Jeb  Bush, Gene  Sperling, Ronald Wilson  Reagan, George  Bush,Republican Party, Home Depot Inc, Center for Responsive Politics, Goldman Sachs Group, Dune Capital Management, Supreme Court, Twitter,Home Depot Inc|HD|NYSE, Goldman Sachs Group|GS|NYSE", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/globe"}, "flashsale": "false", "viewport": "width=device-width, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "eomportal-uuid": "30891476-156e-11e6-a604-5a82f07ffb35"}, "article_summary": "\u201cNo one is in the know.\u201dThe Trump campaign has convened few meetings with executives or trade groups to discuss proposals.\nThe rupture occurring within the Republican Party over Donald Trump\u2019s stunning takeover is sending tremors through Wall Street.\nThe Trump campaign did not respond to requests to comment for this story.\nWall Street overwhelmingly favored Romney in the 2012 race.\n\u201cI think most Wall Street money will be with Hillary Clinton,\u201d said Brian Gardner, a Washington analyst with investment bank Keefe Bruyette & Woods Inc. \u201cThere are relationships there."}
