She had knee surgery about a decade ago. She\u2019s also had back surgery and suffers from a spinal disease.\n\nThe 71-year-old Louisville resident said she is \u201cfairly savvy\u201d when it comes to dealing with salespeople\u2014but a few weeks ago she invited a medical supplies salesman into her home.\n\nWhen the salesman left, Lonergan was the new owner of a back brace she didn\u2019t need.\n\n\u201cI knew the thing wasn\u2019t going to work,\u201d she said.\n\nFor two weeks, she tried to return the brace. She called and left messages, but only got \u201cthe run-around.\u201d\n\nA new requirement for Medicare beneficiaries and physicians aims to prevent situations like Lonergan\u2019s.\n\nStarting this week, Medicare beneficiaries who need durable medical equipment\u2014such as walkers, wheelchairs and oxygen tanks\u2014are required to meet with physicians face-to-face before getting their prescriptions.\n\nKeeping with requirements of the Affordable Care Act, the face-to-face exams must be conducted within six months before a new prescription for durable medical equipment is created.\n\nAccording to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, a new prescription is needed when:\n\nFor all claims for purchases or initial rentals\n\nWhen there is a change in the prescription for the accessory, supply, drug, etc.\n\nIf a local coverage determination (LCD) requires periodic prescription renewal (i.e., policy requires a new prescription on a scheduled or periodic basis)\n\nWhen an item is replaced\n\nWhen there is a change in the supplier\n\nWhen required by state law\n\nThe new rule is supposed to help stop fraud and put an end to medical supplies companies taking advantage of older patients, said Michelle List, social services program coordinator for Senior Medicare Patrol, a part of Louisville Metro Department of Public Health & Wellness.\n\nList said Medicare loses about $60-$90 million a year to fraud.\n\nFraud commonly stems from medical supplies companies \u201charassing beneficiaries,\u201d List said.\n\n\u201cThe way we see it, typically, they\u2019re calling them or sending faxes to doctors for approval for equipment,\u201d she said.\n\nBut Lonergan said she doubts the new face-to-face requirement will do much to stop the fraud.\n\nShe said the fraud for durable medical equipment has \u201cbeen an ongoing thing for a very long time.\u201d\n\n\u201cEspecially if you get some of the older people, it will be real easy to slip something in there they didn\u2019t need and they will never know it,\u201d Lonergan said.\n\nThough the requirements for face-to-face exams are now in effect, the enforcement of the rule will begin later in the year, according to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.\n\nLonergan said she hopes the enforcement is strict, because rules like the new face-to-face requirement may encourage some doctors to team with medical supplies companies to boost sales of certain equipment.\n\n\u201cThere could be people that go into the doctor\u2019s office, not know much about the doctor, because they need a brace and it could all be set up,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI could see how they could set it up, it could be very easy, the (medical supply) company finds a few people a sends them to the doctor\u2019s office, for money people will do the strangest of things.\u201d\n\nShe said she sees accessibility as perhaps another downside to the new rule. For Lonergan, getting to the doctor for the face-to-face exams will not be an issue because already makes visits a few times a month.\n\nBut for other people, she said, getting to a doctor can be a hassle.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re not making it easy,\u201d she said.\n\nHere is a list of medical supplies that qualify as durable medical equipment:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "89.3 WFPL", "description": "Jean Lonergan has been a Medicare beneficiary since 1998.
