Kimi Lee is a San Francisco-based graphic designer and mobile game illustrator. These two women are members of the designer base for Shutterfly, Inc.\u2019s Tiny Prints stationery and customizable products division. From opposite sides of the country, both designers embrace an initial low-technology approach to how they create the products many have purchased.\n\n\u201cIt starts with a lot of writing and drawing,\u201d Woodman said of her design process. \u201cI do a lot of sketching and looking through magazines and pulling things of interest.\u201d\n\nLee shares this approach, opting to conduct background research and sketch by hand. Both women use a computer to finalize their designs, only once a concrete idea has jelled.\n\nEach designer\u2019s start in this industry, however, is where the common ground ends.\n\nWoodman is an Augusta, Ga., native. Completing an undergraduate degree at University of Georgia, she sought further training at the Portfolio Center in Atlanta for graphic design. After graduating in 1994 and working for a design firm for nine years, she noticed \u201ca niche missing in the stationery world,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cFifteen years ago, there was a hole in the stationery market. It was pretty basic stuff,\u201d she said.\n\nIt was back then, in the year 2000, that she began her career in stationery starting simplyput and selling her line wholesale to over 400 stores nationwide.\n\n\u201cWe would send things ourselves,\u201d she said, of distributing her products to consumers. Through 2005, she focused exclusively on cards, but broadened her scope as the market became more creative.\n\nLee\u2019s interest in design and illustration began at an early age with a natural attraction to doodling.\n\n\u201cI used to scribble on anything I could get my hands on,\u201d she said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t until my early high school years did I teach myself how to use programs such as Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator,\u201d taking her skills from \u201cjust being hand-drawn illustrations to graphic art.\u201d\n\nAfter graduating in 2005 from University of California, Davis with a degree in design, she didn\u2019t originally look to a career in stationery design, though it was an already present aspect of her life.\n\n\u201cI would design and make my own birthday cards, letter sets, party invitations and more to give away as gifts to my friends and family,\u201d Lee said. \u201cAfter college, I was actually seeking a career in the gaming industry as an artist, but was then given the opportunity to work with Tiny Prints.\u201d\n\nLee got involved with Tiny Prints through a friend who knew the company was looking for designers. \u201cLearning more about them and what they did, I felt it would be a great fit and was really excited about the opportunity,\u201d she said.\n\nThe Tiny Prints brand, which operates tinyprints.com and weddingpaperdivas.com, remains the largest acquisition by Shutterfly, according to Zacks Investment Research. It was acquired in 2011 for $146.5 million in cash and nearly 4 million shares of Shutterfly common stock.\n\nLee and Woodman are two of 35 Tiny Prints featured designers, who compete with more recognizable brands like Hallmark and Vera Bradley.\n\nIn an effort to remain continuously creative in an ever-changing industry, both designers have nuanced approaches to how they get inspired.\n\n\u201cI am inspired by simple, everyday things that I randomly encounter throughout my day,\u201d Lee said, noting that she also loves \u201cto wander around parks, fabric and clothing stores for inspiration.\u201d\n\nWoodman takes a more pop culture route in her search for muses. She always creates a playlist of unique artists whose messages resonate with her. Currently on her playlist is New Zealand singer-songwriter Lorde. Now an owner of a retail location in the White Provisions district of Atlanta, her competitors also, admittedly, inspire her, she said.\n\nEven though both designers have come to the Tiny Prints brand and stationery design from two different points of view, the advice they have for others interested in graphic design is complementary.\n\n\u201cThe only thing I can tell people is that they really will benefit from a kick ass education,\u201d Woodman said. \u201cGo somewhere that has a great design department [and] work in the real world so that one day they can tear it down.\u201d\n\nLee\u2019s suggestion: be authentic.\n\n\u201cI do believe it is important to stay true to your personal design aesthetic and style once you find it,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s what makes you unique, which is really important in the design industry. They\u2019re always looking for something fresh.\u201d\n\nMoving forward, Lee says she would like to expand her personal brand by continuing work with Tiny Prints and potentially looking into children\u2019s book and mobile app illustrations.\n\nWoodman says she is focused on managing her relationship with Tiny Prints, as well as building the simplyput brand locally.\n\nTo see both designers individual designs visit kimilee.com and simplyputpaper.com.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Ashley Woodman,Business,design,digital photo retailer,Kimi Lee,Photography,Redwood City,Shutterfly,Tre\u2019vell Anderson,Business & Money,Features,Culture & Features,Frontpage Featured", "description": "San Francisco-based Kimi Lee and Atlanta-based Ashley Woodman embrace an initial low-technology approach for creating products for Shutterfly, Inc.\u2019s Tiny\u2026", "generator": "WordPress 3.5", "robots": "noodp,noydir"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcbc25\"", "article_summary": "These two women are members of the designer base for Shutterfly, Inc.\u2019s Tiny Prints stationery and customizable products division.\nThe Tiny Prints brand, which operates tinyprints.com and weddingpaperdivas.com, remains the largest acquisition by Shutterfly, according to Zacks Investment Research.\nWoodman says she is focused on managing her relationship with Tiny Prints, as well as building the simplyput brand locally.\nCompleting an undergraduate degree at University of Georgia, she sought further training at the Portfolio Center in Atlanta for graphic design.\nLee and Woodman are two of 35 Tiny Prints featured designers, who compete with more recognizable brands like Hallmark and Vera Bradley."}
