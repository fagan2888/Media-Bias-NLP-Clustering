Jim Abeler\u2019s name won\u2019t be at the top of the voting list in the Minnesota House of Representatives.\n\nAfter not seeking re-election last year, the Anoka Republican\u2019s eight-term run at the Legislature wrapped up this week.

Copyright Minnesota House of Representatives; Photo by Paul Battaglia\n\nAbeler is known for his expertise in health and human services, his collaborative nature and his independent streak \u2013 his voting record regularly aligned with the needs and wants of his constituents, but not always the Republican Party.\n\n\u201cI was truly a citizen legislator. I was a chiropractor, a charter school founder, a father, a volunteer in the community \u2013 just a regular person who thought I needed to go make a difference,\u201d Abeler said.\n\nGoing into the job, he had never even taken a political science course.\n\nThere have been two rounds of redistricting during his tenure, but most recently he has represented House District 35A, which includes Anoka and Ramsey. It becomes the job of newly-elected Republican Rep. Abigail Whelan.\n\n\u201cOut in this neck of the woods people just wanted me to keep it off their back. They\u2019re up to their necks in their family, paying their bills, their taxes and getting the schools going \u2026 so they\u2019re grateful for somebody who they trust who would do their best,\u201d Abeler said.\n\nWhen Abeler\u2019s predecessor, former House Rep. Charlie Weaver, announced that he wasn\u2019t running in the 1998 election, Abeler decided to go for it.\n\nJust off founding PACT Charter School, which had its roots in Anoka and has since moved to Ramsey, Abeler saw some of the hurdles that stood between the state government and its citizens.\n\n\u201cWhen we founded the charter school, I became aware of some challenges in education,\u201d Abeler said. \u201cWe did the school as an experiment to see if we included parents more if that would be productive.\u201d\n\nWhile Abeler is no longer involved with PACT, the charter school has continued to grow over the past 20 years, with a current enrollment of 650 students and 2,000 more on a waiting list.\n\nA freshman\n\nAbeler won that first election in a close contest against DFL\u2019s Jerry Newton, who now represents House District 37A, by 393 votes \u2013 just 2 percent. During the campaign he knocked on 10,000 doors. Rep. Jim Abeler (R-Anoka) at work as the chairman of the Health and Human Services Committee in 2012. File photo, ABC Newspapers\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s only 190 people changing their mind,\u201d Abeler said. \u201cThat\u2019s pretty close in a district like ours.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s run against Newton twice and says they have since become good friends.\n\nThe day Abeler was sworn into office his wife Barb gave birth to the couple\u2019s sixth son, Judson, who turned 16 this week on Abeler\u2019s last day in office.\n\nLooking back, he said, \u201cit isn\u2019t really a job I would recommend for someone with a young family.\u201d\n\nIn Abeler\u2019s first term, he joined a battle to save the Anoka Technical College, which was slated to close after a 13-2 vote by the Minnesota State Colleges and Universities Board of Directors.\n\nDan Erhart, who at the time was a commissioner on the Anoka County Board, asked for Abeler\u2019s help.\n\nEventually, the college would stay with help from dozens of community leaders and staff at the college\n\n\u201cI think that the MnSCU system was surprised that a punk freshman could win. It became a policy fight and a political fight and a statement that MnSCU needs to worry about access, and they never tried to close another school after that.\u201d\n\nHuman services\n\nGoing in, Abeler assumed that he might become more involved on educational issues at the state level. That didn\u2019t turn out to be the case.\n\nInstead, he became a leader in the realm of health and human services.\n\nAnoka County Administrator Jerry Soma was leading the county\u2019s human services division when Abeler was first elected. Like many rookie legislators, Abeler asked to come in and learn more about the county\u2019s human services programming. \u201cWe did the dog and pony show in the conference room where all the departments came in and talked about what they did and the issues they were having,\u201d Soma said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t anything unusual.\u201d\n\nBut what happened next was.\n\nHe remembers getting a call from Abeler asking why county staff hadn\u2019t given any input on the state\u2019s latest health and human services bill.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t get a lot of calls like that,\u201d Soma said.\n\nSo staff went through the bill line by line and offered suggestions, Soma said.\n\nThe bill died in committee.\n\nBut it was the start of a long relationship between Abeler and Soma and it kicked off what would become the defining work of Abeler\u2019s legislative career.\n\nThis was when Abeler first began to learn about the realm of people living with disabilities and the services they rely on, often for life.\n\nThe humanity of it drew him in.\n\nWhen Abeler came into office in 1999 Republicans were in the majority for the first time in 12 years.\n\n\u201cI thought that I would broaden out my expertise to become an expert in more areas,\u201d Abeler said. \u201cTo my surprise, my focus narrowed \u2013 instead of growing broader, I went deeper.\u201d\n\nIn 2011, Abeler was named the chairman of the Health and Human Services Committee, which would turn out to be his most difficult, and most gratifying, work.\n\n\u201cIt turned out to be a bucket list thing,\u201d Abeler said. \u201cA once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.\u201d\n\nBut that chance came with a huge challenge. Gov. Mark Dayton has just been elected, replacing Gov. Tim Pawlenty, and the state was facing a $6 billion budget shortfall.\n\nThe system needed to be retrenched, Abeler said, and it was his job to lead that effort, along with newly named Health and Human Services Commissioner Lucinda Jesson.\n\nJesson was a reformer, Abeler said, and they were well-matched.\n\n\u201cIt was the hardest time of my life, I think,\u201d Abeler said. \u201cI didn\u2019t sleep well for four months, knowing that if I messed up somebody could die. I didn\u2019t want anybody to come to harm.\u201d\n\nWhen the budget was finally put together at the end of March in 2012, a fiscal analyst told Abeler nobody was going to die from it.\n\n\u201cIt sounds crude, but I just relaxed,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I slept eight hours that night.\u201d\n\nFrom November to March, he took 400 meetings from the public, lobbying groups, advocates and nursing home administrators.\n\nHe looked to successes in the private sector, at models like Mary T in Coon Rapids, to improve services for people with disabilities.\n\nFor Abeler, how that difficult task was tackled was just as important as the end result.\n\n\u201cFor once in my life, I was able to set the tone of a whole niche of government,\u201d Abeler said. \u201cThe tone was respectful. It was caring and humanitarian but it was frugal. It was focused on outcomes and the welfare of the clients.\u201d\n\nHe was able to preserve mental health services, in particular for adolescents, something that was close to his heart after Anoka experienced a series of young people dying by suicide.\n\nThe chairmanship changed Abeler\u2019s mind on term limits for House members, which was something he thought he could support. Abeler was in his 13th year at the Legislature when he was named to the leadership position.\n\n\u201cIt took all the knowledge and experience I had to fill the role,\u201d he said.\n\nAbeler has been the recipient of more than 60 awards, with most of the accolades coming from nonprofits and advocacy groups for the clients that receive services under the health and human services umbrella.\n\n\u201cI think that shows how effective he is as a legislator and that other groups have noticed the impact he has had on policy,\u201d said Kathy Tingelstad, a former Republican legislator from Andover who represented the neighboring district.\n\nIn 1999 Tingelstad was charged with mentoring a group of new legislators, including Abeler.\n\n\u201cJim is very intelligent and has a keen understanding of things. He caught on much faster than any other legislator I\u2019ve known.\u201d\n\nShe calls him creative and innovative, particularly when it was time to tackle that human services budget.\n\n\u201cI think he really looks at issues holistically,\u201d she said. \u201cThe way he voted on an issue had to be in balance with his conscience and his constituents. There have been too many legislators who vote only with their caucus.\u201d\n\nTaking a stand\n\nIn 2008 Abeler made headlines, along with Tingelstad, when the pair was among eight Republicans who voted to override Pawlenty\u2019s veto of the transportation bill that included $6 billion in new taxes over 10 years to fund transportation infrastructure.\n\nIt started the year before when there was talk of finding money and the most obvious was a user fee.\n\n\u201cWe were persuaded that we were going to do the right thing, not the easy thing,\u201d Abeler said. \u201cI asked around and I surveyed people and talked to business leaders, and they all said you better vote for this because we need the roads.\u201d\n\nLess than a year earlier, the I-35W bridge had collapsed and the state had no plan, or funding, in place to fix hundreds of decaying bridges, he said.\n\nBut bucking the party line changed Abeler\u2019s trajectory in politics.\n\n\u201cIt made me both a hero and a goat by different groups. After counsel and prayer and consideration, I decided to vote to override the governor.\u201d\n\nOut of that money came the third lane on Highway 10 between Egret and Hanson boulevards. Abler said it was the only new road in the state to be built from those funds. The rest has been used to repair more than 180 defective bridges.\n\nAlmost seven years later, Abeler is still sure he made the right call.\n\n\u201cPeople loved me and people hated me,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I knew I did the right thing. I didn\u2019t feel bad, I didn\u2019t ask for forgiveness. Because we needed roads.\u201d\n\nThe next week both Tingelstad and Abeler were not supported at their respective endorsement conventions. Abeler won a Republican primary and kept his seat. Tingelstad did not seek re-election.\n\nThis was not the only time Abeler put himself in a controversial spot, which included his involvement in trying to improve the state\u2019s health insurance exchange under the Affordable Health Care Act. He knew the bill was going to pass, but he wanted a chance to make it better.\n\nTingelstad said his ability to work with both Republicans and Democrats is notable.\n\nAbler is proud of his collaborative spirit.\n\n\u201cI learned very early on that you can get a lot done if you don\u2019t care who gets the credit,\u201d he said.\n\nHe found himself on four or five conference committees a year, where the real action happens, he said.\n\nHe spent a lot of time making suggestions about other legislators\u2019 bills and authored more than 500 himself, offering countless amendments before they were presented.\n\n\u201cThe goal was to focus on the end result, which was better services delivered in a better way for the people who need it,\u201d Abeler said. \u201cLaws are going to get passed. You want them as good as they can be, that was my motto all the way through.\u201d\n\nThings change\n\nIn 2012 the Democrats had control of the House, Senate and the governor\u2019s office.\n\nNow in the minority, Abeler said there was less for him to do. The phone stopped ringing the day after the election.\n\nHe said he tried to offer help and his expertise, but it wasn\u2019t well received by the Democrats.\n\n\u201cThey just weren\u2019t that interested,\u201d he said. It was a letdown.\n\n\u201cWhere it has evolved to, even in my 16 years, is that things have become much more polar, more personal and frankly more petty, to the detriment of the product \u2013 and the product is services to the people or enabling businesses to be successful or opportunities you try to create,\u201d Abeler said.\n\nHe began to turn his attention to federal politics and thought maybe that was where he should head next.\n\nLast year he made a run for the U.S. Senate seat held by Democratic Sen. Al Franken. Abeler didn\u2019t get the Republican Party\u2019s endorsement, which went to Mike McFadden after 10 ballots over two days, but he wasn\u2019t surprised. He ran against McFadden in a primary anyway.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t want to have any regrets,\u201d Abeler said. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to look back and wonder what might have happened.\u201d\n\nHe spent much of the year traveling the state, meeting people and learning about communities. He lost the primary, but said he learned a great deal.\n\nNow he will continue his work as a chiropractor, something he kept up two or three days a week while in office. He also manages the commercial and retail buildings he owns.\n\nAbeler has already taken on contracts to lobby in the areas of disabilities and autism.\n\nHe also says he will \u201cprobably run for something again.\u201d\n\nBut for now, he quotes Bilbo Baggins from \u201cThe Hobbit.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going on an adventure.\u201d\n\n[email protected]", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "ABC Newspapers", "description": "This will be the first legislative session in 16 years Rep.
