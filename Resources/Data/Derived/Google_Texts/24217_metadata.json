Jerry Brown was suprisingly cautionary, defying predictions that he would tout such expansionary projects as high-speed rail and the twin water tunnels under the Sacramento Delta.\n\nThe most-telling moment came after he celebrated, to applause from the gathered lawmakers in the state Capitol, putting the budget in surplus and paying down the $26 billion debt left him in 2011 by the exiting Arnold Schwarzenegger administration.\n\n\u201cYou should applaud,\u201d Gov. Brown said, departing from his prepared text. \u201cBecause there might not be much coming after this,\u201d meaning new surpluses. That was an obvious reference to the sharp declines in stock markets so far this year.\n\nYet there was much he celebrated. He touted raising the state\u2019s mimimum wage to $10 this year from $8 when he took office. That jump also has encouraged Los Angeles, San Francisco and other cities to raise their minimum wages yet higher, to $15 over the next few years. Actually, a higher minimum wage, especially in low-wage areas such as the Inland Empire, mainly will kill entry-level jobs \u2013 even as another recession may loom.\n\n\u201cMost importantly \u2013 and this is truly monumental \u2013 we have wholeheartedly embraced the Affordable Care Act,\u201d he said. \u201cAs a result, we are now enrolling 13.5 million Californians in Medi-Cal and another 1.5 million in Covered California.\u201d We would contend that it should not be a matter of pride that one-third of Californians are getting medical welfare.\n\nHe called for fixing the state\u2019s crumbling roads, but insisted that \u201c[d]oing so without an expanded and permanent revenue source is impossible.\u201d Actually, the state just needs to spend highway taxes and fees on repairs instead of siphoning off the money to the General Fund.\n\nSince he is running to replace Gov. Brown in 2018, Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom\u2019s heart must have skipped a beat when the governor quipped that he might change the state Constitution to run for a fifth term.\n\nIn sum, the speech made it clear that the one legacy Gov. Brown values above all others is that he did not bust the budget.", "article_metadata": {"geo.placename": "Santa Ana", "geo.region": "US-CA", "content_section": "commentary", "description": "Opinion: Brown mixes caution with celebration | state, brown, gov, wage, million, year, actually, californians, most, minimum", "geo.position": "33.745573;-117.867834", "og": {"site_name": "The Orange County Register", "description": "In his State of the State address Thursday, Gov.
