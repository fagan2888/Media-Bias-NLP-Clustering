(Photo: Getty Images)\n\nHillary Clinton may not have a serious opponent for the Democratic nomination \u2014 except herself.\n\nThe Clintons\u2019 unfortunate tendency to be their own worst enemy is on display, again, with reports that, as secretary of state, Hillary Clinton conducted official business solely from a personal email account.\n\nThis is a problem \u2014 and not only because it presents a particularly unflattering contrast with the move by former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush to release a flood of official emails.\n\nIt illustrates Clinton\u2019s reflexive impulse to secrecy over transparency, a tendency no doubt bolstered by the bruising experience of her White House years, yet one that she would be well advised to resist rather than indulge.\n\nAnd \u2014 not that shoe-on-the-other-foot comparisons have much power to embarrass in politics these days \u2014 but it contrasts with Democrats\u2019 howls of outrage over disclosures that operatives in the George W. Bush White House conducted official business on private email accounts.\n\nIndeed, Clinton herself was once worked up about this very issue.\n\n\u201cWe know about the secret wiretaps, the secret military tribunals, the secret White House email accounts,\u201d she said back then.\n\nSo what to make of the revelation that Clinton avoided official email entirely while at State? This had to be a deliberate decision. After all, the issue of the Bush emails was still in the news.\n\nAnd, as the Washington Post\u2019s Philip Bump reports, the email domain clintonemail.com that she appears to have been using was created on Jan. 13, 2009, the very day Clinton\u2019s confirmation hearings began.\n\nTo back up: The Federal Records Act requires agencies to maintain records of official business, including emails. The National Archives, which oversees such collection, had this to say in 2013 about the use of personal email accounts:\n\n\u201cWhile agency employees should not generally use personal email accounts to conduct official agency business, there may be times when agencies authorize the use of personal email accounts, such as in emergency situations when federal accounts are not accessible or when an employee is initially contacted through a personal account. In these situations, agency employees must ensure that all federal records sent or received on personal email systems are captured and managed in accordance with agency recordkeeping practices.\u201d\n\nSo far, the explanation from Clintonworld about the failure to comply with this basic rule of modern archiving has been inadequate and unpersuasive.\n\nClinton spokesman Nick Merrill \u201cdeclined to detail why she had chosen to conduct State Department business from her personal account,\u201d reported the New York Times, which broke the story. Merrill said that because Clinton was communicating with other State Department officials on their government accounts, she had \u201cevery expectation they would be retained,\u201d the Times added.\n\nThis has the distinct odor of hogwash. First, the basic rule that government business is to be transacted from government accounts doesn\u2019t have a well-we\u2019ll-capture-it-anyway exception.\n\nSecond, the government records to be retained aren\u2019t only intra-agency communications. If Clinton is emailing with world leaders or others about official business, the entire point of the Federal Records Act is to ensure that those communications are captured for history.\n\nThis should have been clear. Certainly, the intersection of email and federal records law has been evolving. Former Secretary of State Colin Powell used a private account \u2014 what he describes in his memoir as \u201cthe then-newfangled email system\u201d \u2014 to communicate with staff and foreign counterparts. His successor, Condoleezza Rice, rarely used email to transact business but employed her government address when she did.\n\nNonetheless, by the time Clinton assumed office in 2009, \u201cnobody in government understood that a high-level official would solely use a private email system,\u201d said Jason R. Baron, a lawyer at Drinker Biddle & Reath and former director of litigation for the National Archives and Records Administration. If officials also used private accounts, he added, regulations in place at the time provided that \u201cyou need to transfer those emails to an official record-keeping system.\u201d\n\nWhat is the legitimate reason for conducting official business on a personal back-channel? Why, if not for purposes of secrecy, would Clinton choose to operate that way?\n\nThat Clinton has recently turned over 55,000 pages of email records in response to an overdue burst of documentary housekeeping by State does not excuse her lack of compliance while in office.\n\nThat her proto-campaign describes her activities as complying with \u201cboth the letter and spirit\u201d of the rules would be jaw-dropping, if it weren\u2019t so sadly familiar.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://post.cr/1BVbSrc", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Conducting official business solely from a personal email account is a problem.", "og": {"site_name": "Post-Crescent Media", "description": "Conducting official business solely from a personal email account is a problem.", "title": "Hillary\u2019s impulse is secrecy", "url": "http://www.postcrescent.com/story/opinion/columnists/2015/03/08/hillarys-impulse-secrecy/24426547/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/postcrescent.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Conducting official business solely from a personal email account is a problem.", "title": "Hillary\u2019s impulse is secrecy", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/4e06aaba79b63bec3711fedb22a4879f9b3998a2/c=500-0-2500-2000&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/Appleton/2015/03/05/B9316486811Z.1_20150305092144_000_G34A4PVC0.1-0.jpg", "creator": "@postcrescent", "site": "@postcrescent", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=880652726", "fb": {"app_id": 117306038338949}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb6dd\"", "article_summary": "\u201cWe know about the secret wiretaps, the secret military tribunals, the secret White House email accounts,\u201d she said back then.\nTo back up: The Federal Records Act requires agencies to maintain records of official business, including emails.\nConducting official business solely from a personal email account is a problem.\nHillary Clinton conducting official business solely from a personal email account is a problem.\nSo what to make of the revelation that Clinton avoided official email entirely while at State?"}
