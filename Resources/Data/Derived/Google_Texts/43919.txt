The makers of Fat Tire Amber Ale are coming to Pennsylvania.

New Belgium Brewing will be working with a dozen distributors in the state to introduce the Belgian-inspired brand to Quaker Staters, the company announced on Tuesday.

“Pennsylvania has been on the horizon for a while now and we are thrilled to secure our distributing partners and hit the ground running this fall,” said New Belgium Brewing’s East Coast Division Sales Director, Rich Rush. “We enjoyed getting to know all of the PA distributors through the last six months of the interview process, and truly feel that we couldn’t have made a bad choice. With that said though, we’re excited to move forward with our selected partners.”

New Belgium’s expansion to Pennsylvania marks the 39th state of distribution.
