Since the contract was made public in November 2013, opponents have questioned its worth and labeled the group\u2019s leader, Gary Alexander \u2014 who led welfare departments in Rhode Island and Pennsylvania \u2014 a conservative ideologue hired to reinforce Republican Gov. Paul LePage\u2019s campaign themes.\n\nThe department, in a written statement, said the Alexander Group will be penalized $450,000, which is approximately what still remained unpaid in the $925,000 contract with the Rhode Island-based firm. DHHS notified the Alexander Group of the decision in a letter dated Thursday.\n\n\u201cWe determined there was value contained in the content that was produced under this agreement,\u201d reads a statement from DHHS. \u201cBut serious problems with citations in the text of two reports warranted both financial penalties and an end to future work to be performed under the contract.\u201d\n\nAlexander said in a written statement Friday that despite the problems, he remains proud of the content of the report.\n\n\u201cWe hold ourselves to the highest possible standard of professional conduct,\u201d he wrote. \u201cSo much as a comma out of place in a report, or in this case, missing some citations, is a failure on our part to live up to that standard. \u2026 But grammatical errors do not undermine the substantive analysis and policy recommendations offered by the reports. Our goal was to give Maine practical reforms to help lift the poor out of poverty and support the neediest like the intellectually disabled, poor children and elderly while delivering value to the taxpayers.\u201d\n\nThe total amount paid to the Alexander Group for the contract, after the penalties, will be $474,760, about $239,000 of which was state funds, according to DHHS. The rest came from federal Medicaid and Temporary Assistance for Needy Families accounts.\n\nLast month, Phil Coyne, assistant special agent in charge of the federal Health and Human Services Office of the Inspector General in Boston, said investigators would be reviewing whether federal funds spent on the contract were used appropriately.\n\nIn addition to terminating the contract \u2014 including payments \u2014 DHHS levied a penalty of 40 percent for the most recent \u201cBaseline Analysis\u201d report, which contained plagiarized sections uncovered by the BDN. That penalty equates to about $145,000, which had not yet been paid to the Alexander Group.\n\nThe department also levied a 25 percent fine for a previous \u201cMedicaid Expansion Analysis,\u201d which equals about $27,000 in state and federal funds. That amount has been reimbursed to DHHS with a check from the Alexander Group.\n\nThe Alexander Group was awarded a $925,000 no-bid contract last year to study the state\u2019s social services programs and come up with recommendations to save money. The contract was controversial from the start, but came under withering scrutiny last month after the Bangor Daily News discovered that portions of the report had been plagiarized. On May 23, LePage stopped payments on the contract while the allegations were examined.\n\nOn Thursday, LePage said during a business trade show in Lewiston that he was disappointed with the state\u2019s handling of the contract and hoped it would become an \u201ceducation moment\u201d about the necessity of requiring deposits from state contractees and guaranteed coverage of legal costs.\n\n\u201cI do believe that we need to be a little bit tougher and use a little bit more foresight when we sign contracts,\u201d LePage said. \u201cI\u2019m trying to work with those that negotiate contracts instead of just saying, \u2018You have to.\u2019 I\u2019m trying to get them to understand the rationale and how it works.\u201d\n\nLePage said that as governor he takes responsibility for the flawed contract.\n\nLePage spokesman Peter Steele wrote in response to emailed questions late Friday afternoon that no actions had been taken so far to improve or alter the development and administration of contracts but that \u201cthis is something that will be worked on.\u201d\n\nDemocrats and others, including House Minority Leader Ken Fredette, R-Newport, have called for the Alexander Group to reimburse the state in full, which will not happen, according to Friday\u2019s announcement.\n\nHouse Speaker Mark Eves, D-North Berwick, has been one of the loudest critics of the contract, which he has argued was designed to affirm positions already taken by LePage and many Republicans, including their opposition to expanding Medicaid in Maine under the federal Affordable Care Act. On Friday, Eves said the contract \u201chas been an egregious waste of taxpayer dollars.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe governor and his administration must be held accountable for using state and federal funds meant for struggling families and hungry children to pay for campaign talking points,\u201d said Eves. \u201cIt\u2019s a relief to see the contract has finally been canceled. It should have never been issued in the first place. Maine people deserve a full refund. Anything less is not good enough.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "AUGUSTA, Maine \u2014 The Maine Department of Health and Human Services announced Friday that it has terminated the controversial Alexander Group contract after revelations that portions of the report were plagiarized.
