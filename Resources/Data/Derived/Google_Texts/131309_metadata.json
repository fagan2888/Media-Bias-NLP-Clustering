Macfadyen, Noozhawk Publisher | @noozhawk | Published on 01.10.2014 12:50 p.m.\n\nWhat were you reading on Noozhawk this week?\n\n1. Police Finally Subdue Man Barricaded in Santa Barbara Home\n\nNicola Zeno Mollo Jr. had quite the day Jan. 8. First, the Santa Barbara tough guy allegedly beat up a puppy. Then he allegedly kicked a 61-year-old woman down the stairs after apparently threatening to kill her.\n\nWhen Santa Barbara police arrived at his house in the 800 block of Bath Street, he decided to go for his full 15 minutes of fame. After a nearly nine-hour standoff, he was taken into custody and slapped with a slew of felony charges.\n\nIt\u2019s not yet known what set off the 39-year-old lunatic. Maybe he got up on the wrong side of a wet bed again. Perhaps the puppy disrespected him. Or someone might have finished off the last of his Froot Loops.\n\nWhatever it was, the 4-month-old dog was the first victim, according to Sgt. Riley Harwood, a police spokesman. When the 61-year-old woman \u2014 a relative of Mello\u2019s, no less \u2014 tried to come to the puppy's rescue, the tirade apparently escalated.\n\n\u201cMollo responded by pointing a handgun at the victim, threatening to kill her, and then kicking her down a flight of concrete stairs,\u201d Harwood said.\n\nThe woman suffered multiple injuries, including a broken ankle, and was taken by other relatives to Goleta Valley Cottage Hospital, which reported the incident to authorities.\n\nHarwood said Mollo has \u201ca history of violence\u201d that includes guns, and he\u2019s reportedly even a member of one of those fearsome \u201coutlaw\u201d motorcycle gangs, no doubt the one with training wheels and colorful propellers on their helmets.\n\nPolice arrived on the scene about 6 p.m., carrying with them a felony warrant charging battery, brandishing a firearm and cruelty to animals. Mollo wasn\u2019t impressed.\n\nAbout 11 p.m., after hours of futile negotiations, officers fired several rounds of tear gas into the house. Still he didn\u2019t budget. An hour later, the SWAT team moved in.\n\n\u201cThey made partial entry into the residence, and had a confrontation with the suspect, who was wielding a machete,\u201d Harwood said. \u201cHe was shot with a less-lethal shotgun round, and then retreated and barricaded himself in the upper level of the residence.\u201d\n\nNegotiators were able to re-establish contact and Harwood said they finally convinced Mollo to surrender around 2:30 a.m. Grinning maniacally as he was taken into custody, the lifelong loser seemed to be quite proud of the ruckus he caused, which includes dozens of inconvenienced neighbors and likely tens of thousands of dollars in law-enforcement expenses that the rest of us will be paying for.\n\nMollo was being held without bail at Santa Barbara County Jail on charges of assault with a deadly weapon, battery resulting in bodily injury, brandishing a firearm, felon in possession of a firearm and terrorist threats, Harwood said. Additional charges may be filed.\n\n2. Badly Decomposed Body Found Near Santa Barbara Park\n\nSanta Barbara police are investigating an apparent suicide after badly decomposed remains were found hanging from a tree in a ravine near Franceschi Park on the Riviera.\n\nSgt. Riley Harwood, an SBPD spokesman, said a gardener working nearby stumbled on the scene in the 1400 block of Mission Ridge Road while investigating a foul odor the afternoon of Jan. 8.\n\nThe remains are believed to be that of an adult male. The cause of death and the circumstances are under investigation.\n\nClick here for free suicide prevention resources that are available 24 hours a day.\n\n3. Sansum Clinic Won\u2019t Accept Blue Shield Patients Under Covered California\n\nSansum Clinic patients with Blue Shield individual health-insurance plans will be able to keep their doctor, just as someone had promised repeatedly. Unfortunately, they\u2019ll be paying much more expensive, out-of-network rates for the privilege. It\u2019s the thought that counts, right?\n\nThe nonprofit Sansum is an in-network provider for Anthem Blue Cross individual plans, whether sold through insurance brokers and companies or on the Covered California insurance exchange that's supposed to buck up Obamacare. Sansum officials were unable to reach a similar agreement with Blue Shield, however, although employer-sponsored Blue Shield health plans are not affected \u2014 for now.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very important for patients to know that if they want to come to Sansum Clinic through the (Covered California) exchange, they need an Anthem Blue Cross plan,\u201d marketing director Jill Fonte told our Giana Magnoli.\n\n4. Motorcycle Crash Sends Goleta Man to Hospital\n\nA Goleta motorcyclist was hospitalized Jan. 5 after he rear-ended a car on Santa Barbara's Westside.\n\nAccording to police, the 24-year-old man drove his Honda 600 motorcycle into an Infiniti sedan that had stopped on West Mission Street to make a left turn into a driveway.\n\nThe man, whose identity was not released, was taken to Santa Barbara Cottage Hospital with abrasions and other injuries, then cited for failing to have a proper license and insurance, said Sgt. Riley Harwood, an SBPD spokesman.\n\nHarwood said the Infiniti driver complained of pain after the collision, but she was not hospitalized. The incident remains under investigation.\n\n5. \u2018Tino\u2019 Ziliotto Remembered for Grace, Groceries, and as Sub Sandwich-Making Legend\n\nFor more than 60 years, Valentino \u201cTino\u201d Ziliotto owned Santa Barbara\u2019s Italian Grocery. He was a fixture at the store and deli, and was known far and wide for his skills as a sub sandwich maker. He died Jan. 2 at age 86.\n\nBorn and raised in the same Voluntario Street house where he died, Ziliotto leaves behind multiple generations of fans he treated more like family than customers.\n\nDavid Bolton, executive director of the California Missions Foundation, is one of them. He first met Ziliotto in the late 1970s while attending Santa Barbara Junior High School, a few blocks away from the deli at 415 E. De la Guerra St.\n\n\u201cHe was such a nice guy in terms of how he treated his customers,\u201d Bolton told our Lara Cooper. \u201cHe would be behind the counter making sandwiches, and his wife, Edith, would be working the cash register.\u201d\n\nZiliotto\u2019s death is not the only era\u2019s end for the family. His niece, Deanna Morinini, told us that they\u2019ve signed a lease on a new location for the store and will soon be moving to 210 W. Carrillo St., the site of a former Carrows restaurant.\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\nCan you really resist a polar bear cub taking its first, uncertain steps?\n\n(Toronto Zoo video)\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\nThere were 74,453 people who read Noozhawk this past week.
