President Barack Obama has endorsed Mayor Mitch Landrieu in his reelection bid, Landrieu's campaign announced Monday.

"Today, with the city poised for even more progress, there is no question that Mitch has earned a second term as mayor - and I hope the people of New Orleans will give him one," Obama said in a written statement that also included Landrieu's grateful response.

"Through thick and thin, he has been a true friend to the people of New Orleans, and with his help New Orleans is on the right path," Landrieu said of the president.

Both Obama and Landrieu are Democrats whose party has had a dominant hold on New Orleans for decades.

Landrieu faces former Civil District Judge Michael Bagneris, NAACP local chapter president Danatus King and entertainer Manny "Chevrolet" Bruno in the Feb. 1 municipal election. Like Landrieu, Bagneris and King are also Democrats. Bruno has not announced a party affiliation.
