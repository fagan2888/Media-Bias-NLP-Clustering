Civil rights legend Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga., publicly repudiated President Barack Obama’s controversial judicial nominee Michael Boggs on Monday, calling his record “in direct opposition to everything I have stood for during my career.”

In his statement, Lewis expressed grave concern and caution in his decision to speak out. “I have tried to refrain from making public statements out of respect for my colleagues and the Senate process,” Lewis said. “I believe it is important to allow each candidate to be evaluated according to his or her own merits and to allow the Senate judicial nomination process to take its course.”

Boggs currently serves as a judge of the Georgia Court of Appeals. His record has drawn the scorn of many Democratic lawmakers, who have criticized President Obama for dealmaking gone awry. Inquiring minds wondered where Lewis, who had remained noticeably on the sidelines, stood.

Rep. David Scott, D-Ga., nearly disowned Lewis on Twitter on Sunday night after Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., claimed that Lewis had signaled his support for Boggs in a private conversation.
