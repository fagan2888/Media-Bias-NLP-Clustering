There have been tensions in the southern province of Sweida, residents say, after the government tried to renege on an agreement to allow young men to serve in local defense forces and instead draft them into the army.\n\nA Syrian who speaks regularly to security officials and leaders from Mr. Assad\u2019s minority Alawite sect, an important component of his base, said recently that a growing number would welcome a political settlement. But with Mr. Assad\u2019s inner circle adamantly opposed to any compromise, he said, the country will face a long insurgency.\n\n\u201cNobody believes it will end in 10 years as long as he is in power,\u201d he said, speaking on the condition of anonymity for his safety. He added that Alawites kept their discontent largely underground because most believed that their choice was between Mr. Assad and extremists bent on slaughtering them.\n\nIn Istanbul, Antakya and the nearby town of Reyhanli this month, numerous insurgents and civilian activists who oppose Mr. Assad, Nusra and Islamic State, also known as ISIS, said that most of Syria would eventually be controlled either by those extremist groups or by the government.\n\nThe fall of the army base at Wadi al-Deif, which straddles an important supply route in Idlib Province, proved the Nusra Front\u2019s dominance, they said. Other insurgents had long besieged the base without victory. Nusra succeeded after seizing much of the province from Harakat Hazm and the Syrian Revolutionaries Front, two of several groups that until recently, American officials were calling the opposition\u2019s new hope.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThose groups had received sophisticated American-made TOW antitank missiles, and their commanders expected to act as the ground force in the American-led campaign against ISIS. But lately they say the flow of American aid has dwindled as Washington\u2019s strategy shifts to building a new force from scratch.\n\nHow exactly the Wadi al-Deif battle unfolded remains murky, with different commanders giving different versions. But reports and images from the operation make two things clear: antitank missiles were used, and Nusra claimed the victory. That means that the American-backed fighters could advance only by working with the Nusra Front, which the United States government lists as a terrorist group, or that they have lost the weapons to the Nusra fighters, effectively joined the group or been forced to follow its orders.\n\nPhoto\n\nOne commander of a group that received antitank missiles said that some F.S.A. fighters were forced to operate them in the battle on behalf of the Nusra Front, which had captured them from American-backed groups \u2014 a turn of events that he worried would lead the United States to cut off support.\n\nHe bitterly likened the F.S.A. to prostitutes, speaking on the condition of anonymity to avoid alienating American officials. \u201cIf I wear Arabic dress and let my beard grow, the West will hate me and Nusra will love me, and vice versa. We are kissing everyone\u2019s rear to get support.\u201d\n\nAbu Kumayt, a fighter with the Syrian Revolutionaries Front who said he fought in the battle under cover, gave a slightly different version. He said that groups with the antitank missiles fought alongside Nusra fighters and under their command \u2014 but that only Nusra and its Islamist ally Ahrar al-Sham were allowed to enter the base when it fell. Nusra, he said, lets groups vetted by the United States keep the appearance of independence, so that they will continue to receive American supplies.\n\nHis group\u2019s commander, Jamal Maarouf, has been unable to enter Syria since his fighters were driven from their base in Idlib Province this fall. In his house in Reyhanli, near Antakya, he blamed anemic Western support and a mistake that he and other fighters made: They initially welcomed Nusra\u2019s foreign jihadists, believing that they would help bring victory.\n\n\u201cNo F.S.A. faction in the north can operate without Nusra\u2019s approval,\u201d Mr. Maarouf said, adding that the front had either bought or terrorized F.S.A. fighters into compliance. \u201cNusra cannot cover every area so they still need them. But once they take control, they will confiscate all weapons or oblige those factions to pledge allegiance.\u201d\n\nIn southern Syria, rebels trained and equipped under a covert C.I.A. program retain more freedom of movement and have claimed advances recently, but insurgents familiar with the battles say most of their successes have come with the help of Nusra fighters who weaken government defenses with suicide bombings.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Maarouf and his men, echoing a common new refrain in the Syrian opposition, said they believed that the United States and other countries wanted Syria\u2019s territory split between Mr. Assad and the Sunni extremist Islamists, to simplify the complex battleground and justify an eventual settlement that would keep Mr. Assad, or most of his government, in power.\n\nWhen their visitors reacted with blank looks and silence, another fighter, Abu Humam, said: \u201cYou feel dizzy \u2014 imagine how we feel. It is like this weather.\u201d He pointed to thick fog outside the window.\n\nOutside, he confided that his family, including a 3-month-old baby, was stranded in the government-controlled city of Idlib. He could not enter Syria to see them.
