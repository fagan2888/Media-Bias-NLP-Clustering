This progress is due in part to a \"concerted attention by hospitals throughout the country to reduce adverse events,\" partially spurred by HHS inititiatives, according to an Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) report.\n\nThe CDC report also contained HAI data collected on the state level, which was then compared to the national data. Not all states, however, reported enough data to be included in the report, and for those that were included, the results were a mixed bag. While 16 states performed better than the nation as a whole on three or more infections, eight performed worse on three or more infections, according to the CDC.\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- check out the CDC report\n\n- read the CDC statement\n\n- read the Consumers Union statement\n\n- see the AHRQ report (.pdf)\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nUpdated medical errors report shows progress\n\nDrop in HACs saves thousands of lives, $12B in costs\n\nMedicare to penalize hospitals with highest rate of HACs\n\nInfection prevention for ICU patients extends lives, saves hospitals thousands\n\nHospital medical errors now the third leading cause of death in the U.S.\n\n6 ways hospitals can address medical errors better", "article_metadata": {"description": "Despite Medicare's recent announcement that it will\u00a0penalize hospitals with the highest rates of hospital-acquired infections, a new Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u00a0report\u00a0indicates that healthcare facilities nationwide made significant progress toward reducing these\u00a0deadly patient harms.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "Despite Medicare's recent announcement that it will\u00a0penalize hospitals with the highest rates of hospital-acquired infections, a new Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u00a0report\u00a0indicates that healthcare facilities nationwide made significant progress toward reducing these\u00a0deadly patient harms.", "title": "CDC report indicates progress on HAI reduction", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/cdc-report-indicates-progress-hai-reduction/2015-01-15", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "Care Delivery,catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTIs),Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC),central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSIs),Department of Health & Human Services (HHS),hospital acquired conditions (HACs),hospital acquired infections (HAIs),methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA),Patient Care & Outcomes", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Care Delivery,Patient Care & Outcomes"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9860\"", "article_summary": "The CDC report also contained HAI data collected on the state level, which was then compared to the national data.\n\"Hospitals have made real progress to reduce some types of healthcare-associated infections--it can be done,\" CDC Director Tom Frieden, M.D., said in a statement about the report.\nThe need to continue the fight against HAIs was echoed by Lisa McGiffert, director of Consumers Union's Safe Patient Project, in a statement about the CDC report.\nDespite Medicare's recent announcement that it will penalize hospitals with the highest rates of hospital-acquired infections (HAIs), a new Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) report indicates that healthcare facilities nationwide made significant progress toward reducing these deadly patient harms.\nWhile 16 states performed better than the nation as a whole on three or more infections, eight performed worse on three or more infections, according to the CDC."}
