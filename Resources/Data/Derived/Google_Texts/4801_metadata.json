Hicks urges O\u2019Keefe to harness these abandoned ballots. \u201cThat\u2019s not even, like, lying and stealing,\u201d she says. \u201cIf someone throws out a ballot, like, if you want to fill it out, you should do it.\u201d\n\nAlso, voters claiming to be confined can request emergency ballots as late as 5:00 p.m. on Election Day, sight unseen, and receive and return them via e-mail before polls close two hours later. There is no mechanism to confirm the legitimacy of such e-mail addresses, especially on such short notice.\n\nElection officials hope to combat fraud by comparing computerized signature records with those on ballot envelopes. This hardly comforts Adams County Libertarian and Green Party watcher Harvie Branscomb.\n\n\u201cIn this county, about 70 percent of the ballot envelopes are reviewed by election judges, and the remainder are approved automatically by computer and unseen by humans,\u201d Branscomb tells me. \u201cI am seeing some apparently non-matching signatures on return-mail ballot envelopes that are being approved for counting.\u201d\n\nColorado voters should husband their ballots, keep them from strangers, and shred them if they prefer not to vote. They also should drop them off as late as possible. Even imagining perfect honesty, leaving marked ballots sitting around between mid-October, when officials sent them to voters, and Election Day could leave some lost, slipped twixt the cracks, or gone with the wind.\n\nAs demonstrated by Senate Democrat Al Franken\u2019s 312-vote 2008 victory in Minnesota and former Republican president George W. Bush\u2019s 537-vote 2000 win in Florida, a rounding error\u2019s worth of disputed ballots can make a loser a victor \u2014 and vice versa.\n\nA smattering of innocently misplaced, carefully fictionalized, or maliciously destroyed mail-in ballots could determine whether Cory Gardner reaches the Senate or Mark Udall (who voted 99 percent with Obama) remains. That outcome, in turn, could decide whether Harry Reid plays second fiddle with or returns as conductor of America\u2019s favorite 100-member symphony.\n\nAnd that\u2019s why Marilyn Marks worries.\n\n\u2014 Deroy Murdock is a Manhattan-based Fox News contributor and a media fellow with the Hoover Institution on War, Revolution, and Peace at Stanford University.", "card": "summary", "title": "An Avalanche of Ballots in Colorado, by Deroy Murdock, National Review"}, "tweettext": "An Avalanche of Ballots in Colorado", "msvalidate.01": "E48498F585100158A880ED1615918208", "robots": "follow, index", "sailthru.title": "An Avalanche of Ballots in Colorado", "keywords": "Deroy Murdock", "fb": {"app_id": 129250807108374}, "sailthru.tags": "An Avalanche of Ballots in Colorado, Deroy Murdock, National Review", "google-site-verification": "OOtPjyj3i8ggfSXzZ7MPoTiwFy_JnfzKMPkjZ5bhpk0", "copyright": "\u00a9 National Review, Inc.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "Deroy Murdock, Politics, Nation, World"}, "article_summary": "Its mail-in ballots should be returned to sender.\nA Colorado clean-elections advocate found this mail-in ballot in a U.S.\nColoradans now vote universally on mail-in ballots, whether they want to or not.\nA smattering of innocently misplaced, carefully fictionalized, or maliciously destroyed mail-in ballots could determine whether Cory Gardner reaches the Senate or Mark Udall (who voted 99 percent with Obama) remains.\nAlso, apathetic voters sometimes dump mail-in ballots in wastebaskets near P.O."}
