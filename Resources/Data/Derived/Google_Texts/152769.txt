While the country remains transfixed by the catfight between Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders, and all the rest, America must occasionally be reminded that there is currently a president in the White House, and that it would be best if he stayed alive for the next 316 days. Thankfully, the president’s doctor has declared that the state of Barack Obama’s health is strong.

After seven years of continual stress and irregular sleep, Obama’s wrinkles have deepened and his countenance has grown noticeably grayer since the golden days of his 2008 campaign, seeming to suggest poor health. Not so, says White House physician Dr. Ronny L. Jackson, who released Obama’s long-form physical-checkup results on Wednesday. Obama has a low resting heart rate (56 b.p.m.), low blood pressure (110/68), 20/20 vision, and low cholesterol—a shockingly normal bill of health for a man in charge of leading the free world and protecting the United States from Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un, among other threats.

According to The New York Times, Obama weighs 175 pounds—half a Taft, historically speaking—which is five pounds less than his last physical exam in June, thanks to a combination of exercise and a good diet.

The report does contain one bombshell: Obama occasionally takes Nexium for his mild acid-reflux symptoms, which, if Republican lawmakers had their way, would disqualify him from the presidency. (The founders said nothing about acid reflux in the U.S. constitution.) Other medications used by the president include Vitamin D, taken daily, and the occasional piece of nicotine gum, which, ironically, is not covered by Obamacare.

Trump, whose physician recently declared that he would be “the healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency,” has yet to come up with any insults about Barack Obama’s health.
