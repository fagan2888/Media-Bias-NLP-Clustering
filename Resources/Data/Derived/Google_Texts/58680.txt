School is out for the summer and pools across eastern North Carolina are opening up for their busiest time of the year.

While swimming is a great way to cool off and have fun, it can also be dangerous. Donetta Wylie manages Fitness Connection in Greenville. She says everyone should swim with a buddy. Also, if a someone can not swim, she encourages everyone to wear a life jacket or to stay in areas where they can touch the bottom.

Wylie says it is always better for parents to swim with their child and to also monitor where they are when not in the pool.

The Fitness Connection pool officially opened Memorial Day, but Wylie says now that school is out, the kids are pouring in. "Everyone is very gracious around here so they know to keep their kids contained or the splashing to a minimum. Everyone is, 'hey you can make sure that you squirt somewhere else!' So everyone's really nice around here about it," she said. "Overcrowding, we're not too crowded over here. It does get pretty packed, but it's only for a small amount of time."

The pool at Fitness Connection is open every day of the week until Labor Day.
