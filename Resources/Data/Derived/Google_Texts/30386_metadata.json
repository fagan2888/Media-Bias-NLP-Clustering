Lindsey Graham said Sunday that a report on the Benghazi attack released late last week is \u201cfull of crap.\u201d\n\nThe GOP-led report found no failures in intelligence of the 2012 attack on the U.S. consulate in Libya and also found that any misinformation released after the attack was incorrect on accident, not in a deliberate attempt to mislead people.\n\nBut Mr. Graham, South Carolina Republican, said on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d that the report is inaccurate and that the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence that released the report accepted a \u201cbunch of garbage.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m saying the House Intelligence Committee is doing a lousy job policing their own,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said the select committee, led by Rep. Trey Gowdy, South Carolina Republican, will get to the bottom of what really happened in the attack that killed four Americans.\n\n\u201cThis report puts all the blame on the State Department and absolves the intelligence agencies,\u201d Mr. Graham said. \u201cAt the end of the day, everybody is pointing fingers at everyone else. That\u2019s why you need a select committee.\u201d\n\nRep. Adam Schiff, California Democrat, said he hopes the report from the House committee will allow the select committee to work on solutions to ensure a similar attack never takes place instead of searching for conspiracies in the past.\n\n\u201cCalling it crap doesn\u2019t change the fact that it was an exhaustive, objective review,\u201d he said. \u201cI think we\u2019ve had the final say on many of these conspiracy theories.\u201d\n\nHe said the report has completely exonerated the administration from any wrongdoing or intentional misleading.\n\n\u201cAt a certain point you have to be willing to accept the answer that there was no conspiracy if you can\u2019t produce evidence of one,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Sen.
