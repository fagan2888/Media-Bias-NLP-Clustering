WEST CHESTER, Ohio (AP) — Donald Trump dodged when asked to clarify controversial remarks about Arizona Sen. John McCain after he was quizzed by a well-known veteran and father of a slain prisoner of war.

During a campaign event near Cincinnati Saturday, Keith Maupin, whose son was killed in Iraq after being taken prisoner, asked Trump to clarify comments he made in July about McCain, a former Vietnam War prisoner of war and the GOP’s 2008 presidential nominee.

“You made a comment to John McCain that you don’t think that captured soldiers are heroes,” Maupin, a Marine Corps veteran, told Trump during the event at a suburban Cincinnati convention center. Maupin’s son Matt, a U.S. Army sergeant, went missing from his unit in Iraq in 2004. His remains were recovered in 2008. “What I’d like you to do is just clarify that, because I think it’s important for all these people here, and for a lot of veterans in Ohio.”

The question came as Trump, the GOP presidential front-runner, vied with Ohio Gov. John Kasich in the GOP primary in Ohio, the most competitive of the winner-take-all-states in Tuesday’s voting.

Trump had said of McCain in July, while campaigning in Iowa, “He’s a war hero because he was captured. I like people who weren’t captured.”
