At $10 an hour, \u201cI make so little that I can\u2019t afford a premium,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI got lucky when I got married,\u201d she said. Her husband has coverage.\n\nBenjamin showed up in blue scrubs with her 5-year-old daughter Aspen on Tuesday to support legislation that would impose fees on large employers that pay low wages and provide no health insurance. The money would go into a fund to support the state\u2019s growing Medicaid costs.\n\nThe legislation would apply to companies with 250 or more workers who earn less than $12 an hour.\n\nIt might also make Colorado unique. According to supporters, no other state has a similar law in effect.\n\nThe news conference, held at the Capitol, featured legislators, workers and a small business owner who contend that large companies gain a competitive edge by letting governments cover the medical expenses of their employees.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, too many people working for large companies have to get onto government assistance through Medicaid,\u201d said Democratic Rep. Crisanta Duran of Denver, the House majority leader. \u201cThe rest of us are picking up the tab.\u201d\n\nThe news conference raised questions about the number of companies affected, how they would be identified and notified and how to count employees in companies with variable wages.\n\nRepublicans voiced skepticism.\n\n\u201cI have not seen an official version of the bill, but from a draft it is not clear how this bill actually helps entry-level employees, and from what I heard about the press conference, there are a lot more unanswered questions about what the bill does,\u201d said House Minority Leader Brian DelGrosso, a Loveland Republican.\n\nDan Pilcher, executive vice president of the Colorado Association of Commerce and Industry, said its members are studying the bill and are taking no immediate position.\n\nThe bill would charge applicable employers a fee ranging from 25 cents to a dollar for each hour worked by employees under the $12 wage cap. A state board would set the actual assessment.\n\nSupporters estimate that the fees, with federal matching funds, could generate $80 million to $130 million yearly toward medical care costs.\n\nMedicaid enrollment has surged in Colorado following the state\u2019s decision to raise income eligibility limits and allow unmarried adults to qualify, an option available to states under the federal Affordable Care Act.\n\nFederal and state spending for Medicaid in Colorado totaled nearly $6 billion in fiscal 2014, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation.\n\nOne supporter, Rachelle Bainter, came to Tuesday\u2019s news conference sporting her McDonald\u2019s shirt with its golden arches and \u201cI\u2019m lovin\u2019 it\u201d slogan.\n\nShe said she suffers from chronic anemia and high blood pressure and depends on Medicare and Medicaid to pay her medical bills because she could not afford $954 a month in rent otherwise.\n\nAfter 28 years at McDonald\u2019s, she said, she has no health insurance and earns $8.65 an hour. McDonald\u2019s offers health care plans but they have been widely criticized as being too costly for employees.\n\nDavid Olinger: 303-954-1498, dolinger@denverpost.com or @dolingerdp", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Colorado bill targets large companies without health insurance plans", "title": "Colorado bill targets large companies without health insurance plans", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/04/05/colorado-bill-targets-large-companies-without-health-insurance-plans/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160328__Co_legp1.jpg", "height": 448}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160328__Co_legp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2016-04-05T16:35:14+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-14T23:14:00+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "McDonald\u2019s offers health care plans but they have been widely criticized as being too costly for employees.\nFederal and state spending for Medicaid in Colorado totaled nearly $6 billion in fiscal 2014, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation.\nWhat she has never been paid, despite her field of work, is a dollar of health insurance by any of them.\nAfter 28 years at McDonald\u2019s, she said, she has no health insurance and earns $8.65 an hour.\n\u201cUnfortunately, too many people working for large companies have to get onto government assistance through Medicaid,\u201d said Democratic Rep.
