Every year at about this time, Supreme Court watchers antsy about upcoming decisions start tweeting @SCOTUSblog to get answers directly from the high court.

But the highest court in the land doesn’t have a blog — it doesn’t have a Twitter account, or for that matter any social media account whatsoever.

Although the account has the disclaimer, “Seriously, only a private blog about the Supreme Court of the U.S. Not the Justices,” many Twitter users nonetheless think they’re tweeting the court — and the results can be hilarious.

The court is expected to rule on same-sex marriage next week — some say Monday. And the blog replied to nervous Nellies on both sides of the issue in the form of an MT, or modified tweet, with the response preceding the original tweet.

Imagine how the Framers feel MT @JohnBauters Sick to my stomach over potential @SCOTUSblog rulings on #gaymarriage & #FairHousing — SCOTUSblog (@SCOTUSblog) June 22, 2015

Another hot button issue that’s predicted to be announced by the court on Friday is the provision of Obamacare governing subsidies.

A plain reading of the act would indicate that subsidies are only available to those purchasing a health care plan through a state exchange. But the Justice Department argued that that wasn’t the intent.

Asswipes actually not subsidized MT @MrBadXample I hope @SCOTUSblog derail #Obamacare so the ass wipes in @RedStates lose their subsidies! — SCOTUSblog (@SCOTUSblog) June 22, 2015

The blog also responded to claims that the high court is racist.

Correlation not causation MT @Ray_Shall_Truth #CharlestonShooting happens cuz this racist @SCOTUSblog doesn’t think #BlackLivesMatter — SCOTUSblog (@SCOTUSblog) June 22, 2015

We keep trying MT @jakecovo @SCOTUSblog u racist bigots have ruined my country I feel ashamed and terrified RESIGN NOW — SCOTUSblog (@SCOTUSblog) June 22, 2015

And when critics think they’re complaining directly to the court for one of its recent decisions, the replies can be just as funny.

We were going for Pandora’s Box. MT @cericme: @SCOTUSblog Congratulations on opening a HUGE can of worms and abused. — SCOTUSblog (@SCOTUSblog) June 30, 2014

Finally, the tweets coming from those who are shocked at the replies they believe are coming from the Supreme Court can be just as hilarious:

The passive aggressive way @SCOTUSblog is answering right now is horrible considering the position they just put women in. Not okay. — Yes I Know (@WollyWollenberg) June 30, 2014
