When the makeup proved to be impossibly\u2014almost comically\u2014hard, every student but Carson walked out. (He heard some students saying that they\u2019d claim they never saw the notice about the makeup.) Then, when Carson was alone, an instructor and a photographer for the Yale Daily News, who snapped his picture, told him that he\u2019d been tricked\u2014but he had also demonstrated that he was the most honest student in the class. Then, Carson remembered, they handed him a ten-dollar bill.\n\nLast week, the Wall Street Journal cited this episode as a problem with Carson\u2019s biography, one that went to his credibility and\u2014because he is largely running on his inspirational life story\u2014to the heart of his campaign. Reporters at the Journal couldn\u2019t find a photo of him in the Yale Daily News; they couldn\u2019t find a course with the name Perceptions 310. But there was, in fact, a problem with the expos\u00e9 itself, which became clear in the next few days: Carson\u2019s story held up a lot better than the Journal had implied.\n\nThere may not have been a captioned photo in the Daily News, but there was an article that described just such a prank having been pulled off by the Yale Record, a humor publication, in January, 1970. It involved a parody edition of the News. The title of the class was Psychology 10, a mistake that Carson blamed on his ghostwriter\u2014not the most gracious move but fair enough. It\u2019s hardly material, and he was writing decades after the fact. BuzzFeed found a Record staff member who recalled helping with the prank, and was \u201c99% certain the way Carson remembers it is correct,\u201d including the difficulty of the makeup questions and how, \u201cat the end, what few students remained \u2014 it may have just been one or two, I wasn\u2019t there \u2014 received a small cash prize.\u201d Some of the commentary that followed suggested that the story still reflected poorly on Carson, because he couldn\u2019t tell the difference between the Record and the Daily News, and because he fell for the stunt, as, presumably, no sophisticated Eli should. This line of attack, with its undertones of \u00e9litism, is not likely to do him any damage with his supporters.\n\nAnother expos\u00e9, by Politico, about whether Carson was offered admission to West Point\u2014he never seems to have formally applied\u2014fell flat for what are, at root, similar reasons. \u201cGifted Hands\u201d can be a confusing book, because the narrative jumps back and forth in the timeline. Carson presents a series of vignettes related to his high-school career, during which he was active in R.O.T.C., and to his college-admissions decisions. There is a Memorial Day parade \u201cat the end of my twelfth grade,\u201d which would have been May, 1969, in Detroit, which he marched in; \u201cafterward,\u201d an encounter with General William Westmoreland at a banquet that celebrated Medal of Honor winners; and, \u201clater,\u201d an offer of \u201ca full scholarship to West Point,\u201d which he \u201cdidn\u2019t refuse \u2026 outright,\u201d and is mainly presented as important because it gives him confidence going into the college-admissions process\u2014which happens at the beginning of twelfth grade, not the end\u2014and the faith, in \u201cthe fall of 1968,\u201d to apply only to a single college, Yale.\n\nThe jumbled way that the book is written can suggest that we are in a time loop. This happens a lot when Carson tells stories or lays out plans, and it is a real point of criticism. (Similarly, if you diagram the hoax-exam story, it sounds like it happened when he was a junior, not a freshman.) But the individual parts are not only plausible but have some real backup. Politico notes that Westmoreland was not in Detroit that Memorial Day, but he was in Detroit in February, 1969, for a banquet a lot like the one Carson describes. Much has been made of Carson\u2019s saying that he was offered a West Point scholarship, given that there is no cost for attending, but in that sense everybody who goes gets a scholarship. And it is more than likely that an Army general would have explained it in those terms to a teen-ager from inner-city Detroit whom he wanted to recruit. The nomination process for West Point does work in a more personal way than, say, the common app. As my colleague Hendrik Hertzberg wrote on Twitter, \u201cIf it\u2019s true that Westmoreland told Carson he could have a West Point appointment for the asking, Carson\u2019s garbled version is forgivable.\u201d Again, the fact that Carson doesn\u2019t talk about it in the way that someone more savvy might is not going to hurt him.\n\nBesides\u2014and this may be the real reason that the West Point story is weak\u2014it hasn\u2019t been disputed that Carson grew up the child of an impoverished, functionally illiterate single mother. Nevertheless, he was accepted to Yale and succeeded there. He went on to the University of Michigan Medical School and became first a resident, then a distinguished surgeon, at Johns Hopkins. There is every reason to believe that he could have gone to West Point if he had pursued it. These facts also point to a weakness in another line of debunking, about whether Carson was really as angry as he remembered being as a fourteen-year-old; he had plenty of things to be angry about. Saying that he was actually always happy-go-lucky, and never needed, as he writes, a religious experience to put aside his hostility and his violent tendencies is also not likely to be a campaign killer, though it does point to how very strange this political season has been. It clearly plays into evangelical Christians\u2019 love of a redemption story\u2014but arguing that people shouldn\u2019t be moved by it because it feels saccharine is, in the absence of real evidence that he has fabricated the basic narrative, more of an aesthetic response than a political one. Ben Carson was a fine student and an exceptional doctor. He is just a very bad candidate for President.\n\nThe odd thing is that the Carson campaign is what might be called a target-rich environment for journalists\u2014or it should be. He has been utterly dismissive of climate change, and he has fostered the idea that vaccines cause autism. The numbers for his tax plan, insofar as there are any, don\u2019t add up. He has said that Joseph, of the coat of many colors, built the pyramids in order to store the grain of the seven fat years\u2014a statement that, as I\u2019ve written, was troubling not because we expect our Presidents to be up on the distinction between Early and Middle Kingdom dynasties but because Carson presented it as an example of why one should reject the theories of experts and scientists and turn, instead, to the Bible. Similarly, his claim that none of the signers of the Declaration of Independence had experience in elective office, when a great number of them did, is significant not only because it is false but because it speaks to a particular view of history and politics. (Carson later amended the statement to say that none had federal experience. Of course, they couldn\u2019t have, because there was no federal government when the Declaration was signed.) He has suggested that President Obama might declare martial law, and that the 2016 elections might be cancelled amid scenes of untenable civil disorder. He has compared Obamacare to slavery and to Nazism. He has also made what PolitiFact judged to be outright false statements in the last Republican debate about his ties to a nutritional-supplement company. (In contrast, PolitiFact rated Carson\u2019s description of West Point\u2019s \u201cscholarships\u201d as mostly true.)\n\nPerhaps the problem isn\u2019t that the media is too partisan but that, in looking at Carson, there was a hope that there might be a non-partisan way to address a campaign whose success is hard for observers of American politics to understand. There is a sense that we are going to wake up one day and Carson and Donald Trump will have departed, and then we can get back to differentiating among the traditional politicians. But what is the mechanism for that? If Carson were onstage only because of his life story, and Trump only because of his celebrity, the two of them would not, together, be getting half of the support of Republicans in every poll. This campaign is not actually a prank being pulled on the public, which will have a moment when the photographer comes out and explains the joke.
