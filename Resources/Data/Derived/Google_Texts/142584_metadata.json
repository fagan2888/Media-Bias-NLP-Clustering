It doesn\u2019t just happen out of nowhere.\n\nPerhaps the Huffington Post is trying to reignite their base by reliving the \u201chorror\u201d of Limbaugh\u2019s Sandra Fluke comments.\n\nRush Limbaugh \u2014 apparently not content with having caused the Sandra Fluke firestorm \u2014 waded into the birth control debate once more on his Wednesday show. This time, the subject was the Supreme Court\u2019s recent ruling in the so-called Hobby Lobby case.\n\nIn reference to the birth control comments, Limbaugh was reiterating a question a caller posed the day before.\n\n\u201cWe had a caller yesterday that asked me this question,\u201d Limbaugh said. \u201cWhen did birth control pills become so important to the human condition that the federal government requires every insurance policy to cover them? Eye exams, dental exams, dental work are not mandated by Obamacare, but contraception is. Birth control pills are.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhich is worse?\u201d Limbaugh asked. \u201cTo go blind from lack of regular eye exams, or to get pregnant? And again, pregnancy is something that you have to do to \u2019cause. It doesn\u2019t just happen to you while you\u2019re walking down the street except in the case of sexual abuse. But in a normal, everyday flow of events, pregnancy requires action that has consequences, and yet we treat it as a great imposition that women need to be protected from. It\u2019s a sickness. It\u2019s a disease, it\u2019s whatever and there\u2019s got to be a pill for it. And yet, they wouldn\u2019t have the problem if they didn\u2019t do a certain thing. It\u2019s that simple.\u201d\n\n\u201cRush Limbaugh\u2019s Thoughts On The Hobby Lobby Case Are As Gross As You\u2019d Imagined,\u201d the article is titled.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Hannah Bleau", "description": "'When did birth control pills become so important to the human condition that the federal government requires every insurance policy to cover them?'", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "The Huffington Post is mad at Rush Limbaugh again, this time after his comments on pregnancy and women\u2019s health.
