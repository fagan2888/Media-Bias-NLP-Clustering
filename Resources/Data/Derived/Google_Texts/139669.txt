SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. — With starting pitching projects such as Jon Gray, Jeff Hoffman, Eddie Butler and Kyle Freeland, the Rockies are hoping for a better future.

With Zack Greinke on the mound, Arizona is all about the here and now.

The 2009 American League Cy Young Award winner makes his Diamondbacks debut Monday night in the season opener vs. the Rockies. Arizona gave Greinke a six-year, $206 million contract to help take the D-Backs from also-rans to contenders.

Asked how he handles the pressure of being Arizona’s new ace, Greinke told Arizona reporters: “I don’t try to wrap my mind around it. It doesn’t cross my mind ever, really.”

Pitching for the Los Angeles Dodgers last season, Greinke went 19-3 and was the runner-up for the NL Cy Young Award. His 1.66 ERA was the second-lowest ERA in Dodgers history. Greinke has posted 15 or more victories in each of the last five seasons, but a 20-win season has eluded him.

Greinke, on Arenado. Greinke has had his way with the Rockies, going 7-3 with a 3.69 ERA in 17 career games (16 starts) against them. He has also dominated third baseman Nolan Arenado, who has hit just .208 (5-for-24) with three doubles and two RBIs vs. Greinke.

But Arenado evolved into one of baseball’s best young hitters last season, belting 42 homers and driving in 130 runs. Arenado has certainly captured the attention, and respect, of Greinke.

“He can hit every pitch,” the veteran right-hander said. “That’s probably the toughest part. Every pitch in every location. There’s not many guys that can do that. I don’t know how he did it.

“It seems like he figured out how to hit the ball in the air more and not strike out, and he still has power. It’s like the perfect combination to hit. Early on, it seemed like he hit more groundballs. … Now he’s more line drives, flyballs. With his power and not striking out, that’s about as good as it gets.”

Spring forward. Left-handed reliever Jason Gurka was slipping off the Rockies’ radar. After putting up a 9.39 ERA in nine games with Colorado last season, Gurka, 28, was removed from the 40-man roster at season’s end.

Monday, however, he will be in the Rockies’ bullpen, thanks to an outstanding performance in spring training that was the result of an improved changeup.

“He basically outpitched the entire camp,” manager Walt Weiss said. “He was dominant. I don’t put all my eggs into the spring training basket, but there was a confidence that he showed this spring that lined up with the performance.”

The former Baltimore Orioles minor-leaguer finished his spring with a 1.69 ERA and 20 strikeouts in 10 innings.

Roster finalized. Colorado set its opening-day roster by placing six players on the disabled list Sunday.

Infielder Daniel Descalso (fractured left hand), right-handers Jon Gray (abdominal strain) and Jason Motte (shoulder strain) and left-handers Tyler Anderson (oblique strain) and Tyler Matzek (anxiety) were sent to the 15-day DL, retroactive to March 25. Right-handed reliever Jairo Diaz, who underwent Tommy John surgery on his right elbow, was placed on the 60-day DL.

The Rockies’ players on the 60-day DL — Diaz, as well as right-hander Adam Ottavino (elbow) and shortstop Jose Reyes, who is on the restricted list — do not occupy slots on the club’s 40-man roster, which is full.

Rockies LHP Jorge De La Rosa (9-7, 4.17 ERA in 2015) at D-backs RHP Zack Greinke (19-3, 1.66), 7:40 p.m. Monday, ROOT; 850 AM

Both opening-day starters have credentials. De La Rosa is the Rockies’ franchise leader in wins (78) and strikeouts (877), and his 48-16 record (.750 winning percentage) at Coors Field surpasses everyone else. Greinke is simply one of the best pitchers of his generation, and he has been paid for it. He shocked the baseball world by signing a six-year, $206.5 million deal with Arizona after a remarkable season in which he posted a 1.66 ERA for the Dodgers — the majors’ lowest since Greg Maddux in 1995. Greinke has made only one opening-day start, back in 2010 with Kansas City when he was coming off his first Cy Young Award. In 17 career games (16 starts) vs. the Rockies, Greinke is 7-3 with a 3.69 ERA. De La Rosa is 9-8 with a 2.94 ERA vs. the D-backs, but he has fared poorly at Chase Field, going 1-7 with a 4.22 ERA in 10 starts.
