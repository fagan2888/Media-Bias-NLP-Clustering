NORTHFIELD, Ill., Dec. 17, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Focusing only on ACA year-end reports risks painful IRS penalties for missed ACA deadlines that can occur at almost any time during the year. Passport's ACA software is designed to help businesses predict and manage ongoing ACA guideline compliance throughout the year.

"We discovered that many companies assume that the Affordable Care Act reporting requirements are like the W-2 year end reporting process - just fill out the forms and send them to the employee and IRS. Not so."

-- John Miller, President, Passport Software

Passport's Affordable Care Act Management Software provides simple employee data entry screens for easy setup. Over a dozen management reports help anticipate ACA-related obligations to avoid penalties. Easily track offers of insurance, calculate Safe Harbor options, and monitor employee hours worked totals. Includes 1094-C and 1095-C reporting, with electronic filing as required.
