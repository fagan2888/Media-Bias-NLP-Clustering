In 2006 she pleaded guilty to drug charges.\n\nIn February of last year Jennifer Darger started her in-home day care. Following city ordinance, she had a pre-opening inspection and a random inspection in May. She passed both.\n\n\"From the time she started until now she has had no citations or anything,\" said Todd Rhinehart, Environmental Health Specialist/Code Enforcement.\n\nBut that clean record doesn't go back terribly far. Eight years ago, Darger pleaded guilty to felony drug charges, but that didn't stop her from being licensed to run an in-home day care.\n\n\"City and state ordinances only require us to check back five years. So if it's prior to that we would have no record of it,\" said Rhinehart.\n\n\"The law delineates the types of criminal convictions that would prohibit a person from working or residing in a regulated child care program,\" said Carroll Forsch, Assistant Director of Child Care Services, S.D. Dept. Of Social Services.\n\nThe city and state only checks for felonies in the last five years, not misdemeanors.\n\nSo what does it take to be licensed with Sioux Falls?\n\n\"They comply with all the regulations with kids. They have to keep it under 12, stay within ratios for kids under 4. In order to get checked they have to complete a background check. An abuse and neglect check. We do a sex offender check and then they have to have First Aid and CPR,\" said Rhinehart.\n\nIf Darger is found guilty, she may not be allowed to open another day care again.\n\nDecisions at the state and city levels are made with a child's safety in mind.\n\n\"If the provider was substantially out of compliance with the regulations, situations are reviewed on a case by case basis,\" said Forsch.\n\n\"We look at everyone that comes in and if there's any question we do discuss it amongst the peers and make decisions at that point,\" said Rhinehart.\n\nThe Sioux Falls Health Department has revoked Darger's license, pending the ongoing investigation.\n\nNews\n\nGeneral {{Title}} Remove Change News General Courts Web Only Crime Outdoors Events Center Non-Homepage Boredom Busters Pipeline Positively KELOLAND Technology Hunger Affordable Care Act Shops Flooding Remembering 9/11 Drought JazzFest Spring Storm Honor Flight Spencer Anniversary\n\nDoApp Health News Business News Sports\n\nAgriculture Markets Livestock Crops Politics\n\nHealthBeat Cancer Children's Health Heart Health Wellness & Nutrition General Health Beat Women's Health RX Resources What's Going Around OTC Diabetes Recalls Dental Health Men's Health\n\nPolitics South Dakota Legislature Budget Congress Taxes General Local Campaign President US Senate New Laws US House Iowa Ballot Issues Local Races Minnesota Gubernatorial\n\nEducation Funding College Elementary High School Pre K School Supplies Middle School\n\nSports Professional College High School Sports Zone Headlines Summit League Tournament Olympics\n\nBusiness Industry Your Money Matters Development Gas & Energy Legislation Economy/Stocks Employment General Health Care Technology Education Funding Tourism Banking/Finance Housing Transportation Insurance Meetings & Events Retail & Restaurants All Industries On The Move Shops Agriculture\n\nFeatured Stories Eye on KELOLAND Inside KELOLAND\n\nWeather Snow Forecast Records Rain Flooding Drought WX Corner General\n\nWorld News\n\nInvestigates GEAR UP\n\nSponsored Done\n\n\u00a9 2016 KELOLAND TV.
