All previous F-35 aircraft have been built at Lockheed Martin\u2019s Fort Worth production hub in Texas. The Italian F-35A/AL-1 successfully completed an 88-minute flight out of Cameri Air Base, about 60 miles north of Turin.\n\nRelated: The $1 Trillion Question for the F-35: Is the U.S. Buying an Inferior Plane?\n\nThe aerial debut was the \u201cfirst-ever F-35 flight outside the United States,\u201d Lockheed said in a statement.\n\nThe jet was assembled at a plant in Cameri that is owned by the Italian government and operated by the firm Finmeccanica.\n\nWhile the maiden voyage may not be on par with the Wright Brothers\u2019 first flight at Kitty Hawk, it marked a milestone for the nearly $400 billion F-35 effort, which has been plagued by production delays and cost overruns that have helped make it the most expensive weapons program in U.S. history.\n\nA bad showing would have been an embarrassment for the F-35 program, especially since Rome plans to buy 90 Joint Strike Fighters for its air force and navy.\n\nRelated: Marine Corps Declares Its Problem-Plagued F-35 Ready for Combat\n\nSeveral countries besides the U.S. and Italy have contributed to the cost of developing the F-35, including Australia, Great Britain, Canada, Denmark, the Netherlands, Norway and Turkey.\n\nThe test flight was the latest in a string of good news for the F-35 program.\n\nIn July, the Marine Corps declared its first squadron of F-35B jets ready for combat, and just last week the Air Force received its first pair of operational F-35A aircraft.\n\nEarlier this summer, incoming Joint Chiefs of Staff chairman Gen. James Dunford indicated to the Senate Armed Services Committee that the Defense Department was reviewing the total projected purchase of 2,443 aircraft for the U.S. military.\n\nHowever, Pentagon press secretary Peter Cook recently dismissed that idea.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not making any formal evaluation or revisit to those objectives at this particular moment in time,\u201d he said during a press briefing in August.\n\nStill, Cook didn\u2019t close the door entirely.\n\n\u201cWith all programs going forward \u2026 every program is going to be reviewed,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cObviously, the budget situation here in Washington will have a big impact on that, but there is nothing at this point to indicate any formal review of this number. But there will be the standard budget review of all programs going forward to FY 17.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The first F-35 Joint Strike Fighter assembled outside the U.S.", "title": "The F-35 Program Gets a Major Boost in Italy", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/09/08/F-35-Program-Gets-Major-Boost-Italy", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/F-35-head-on.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/09/08/F-35-Program-Gets-Major-Boost-Italy", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/F-35-head-on.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "The first F-35 Joint Strike Fighter assembled outside the U.S.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8aa2\"", "article_summary": "All previous F-35 aircraft have been built at Lockheed Martin\u2019s Fort Worth production hub in Texas.\nThe aerial debut was the \u201cfirst-ever F-35 flight outside the United States,\u201d Lockheed said in a statement.\nThe first F-35 Joint Strike Fighter assembled outside the U.S. made its inaugural flight on Monday.\nThe test flight was the latest in a string of good news for the F-35 program.\nRelated: Marine Corps Declares Its Problem-Plagued F-35 Ready for CombatSeveral countries besides the U.S. and Italy have contributed to the cost of developing the F-35, including Australia, Great Britain, Canada, Denmark, the Netherlands, Norway and Turkey."}
