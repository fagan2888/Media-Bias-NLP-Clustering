Efforts to make a homeless shelter out of the old Long's Warehouse building in Meridian have come to a halt.

Clinic director Christie Rainer tells Newscenter 11 the People's Charity Clinic has been notified by the building's owner that it must vacate the building by Monday afternoon. She says this comes after a visit from fire chief Anthony Clayton, who says the building is not up to code. The clinic now has to figure out what to do long-term.

"And what we were told is that no matter how hard we tried, this building would never be up to code," Rainer says. "And basically none of the building's in Meridian would be up to code."

Rainer says 65 people will be impacted by this. She tells us South Harbor Shelter will open next week, which can assist two families.
