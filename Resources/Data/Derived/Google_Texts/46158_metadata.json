Rick Perry and Illinois Democratic Gov. Pat Quinn butted heads Friday over their two very different plans for their respective states, with Perry unveiling an ad designed to entice Illinoisans to make the move away from liberal governance to the Lone Star State.\n\nPerry battled Quinn during a segment on CNN\u2019s \u201cCrossfire,\u201d hosted by former Obama aide Van Jones and former Republican Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich. Quinn went after the Texas governor for not taking federal money in order to implement Obamacare.\n\n\u201cWhy not accept the money from Washington to have more people with health coverage?\u201d he asked. \u201cWe\u2019ve that in Illinois. I can\u2019t understand why Texas doesn\u2019t want to have everyday people \u2013\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, the answer is very straightforward, governor,\u201d Perry interjected. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to bankrupt our state. Because we know what\u2019s going to happen\u2026 The key is access to health care. And what you\u2019re talking about doing with Obamacare is \u2014 I\u2019m trying to find people who are for it now, because it\u2019s coming apart as we watch.\u201d\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s the bigger question,\u201d Perry later asked. \u201cWould you rather make the decisions for healthcare for Illinois \u2014 you and your legislature \u2014 or would you rather a bureaucrat from Washington DC? Because that\u2019s what we\u2019ve got with Obamacare. They\u2019re making the decisions for YOU.\u201d\n\nQuinn countered that he\u2019s \u201cwalked across Illinois, from the Mississippi River to Lake Michigan. And we have a decent healthcare for everyone. And you can\u2019t have a system \u2014 as you have in Texas \u2014 where there\u2019s Rolls-Royce coverage for some people and no coverage whatsoever for lots of hard-working people!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy are 1,000 people a day moving to the state of Texas if it\u2019s such a terrible place, man?\u201d Perry asked incredulously. \u201cThat\u2019s what I want you to tell me. Why?\u201d\n\nCNN also ran a new ad from Perry\u2019s office, now airing in Quinn\u2019s home state. The ad labels Illinois 48th in job creation and urges people to seek economic opportunity by packing up and moving to Texas.\n\nQuinn was thrown on the defensive. \u201cWe\u2019re not 48th in job creation, he\u2019s wrong about that,\u201d he began, his voice rising. \u201cNot only that, we have more people with college degrees, more people who have graduated from high school! We\u2019re number one when it comes making sure we build building in a 21st century way \u2014 we just got that award. Top ten in energy efficiency. We can teach you a few things.\u201d\n\n\u201cCompetition\u2019s good,\u201d Perry responded. \u201cAnd you put your policies into place \u2014 and let\u2019s face it, Illinois has liberal policies, from the standpoint of tax and regulatory, they are \u2014 and people can get to pick where they want to live. And it\u2019s ok for them to move to Indiana or Illinois or wherever. But they\u2019re moving to Texas!\u201d\n\nFollow Brendan on Twitter\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
