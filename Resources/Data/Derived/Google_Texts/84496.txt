In order to decrease rapid turnover of healthcare employees and increase employee engagement, hospitals and other healthcare institutions must commit to three key strategies, according to a white paper published this week by Press Ganey.

Targeted engagement strategies can build a powerful health organization that succeeds at the levels of patient experience, employee retention and financial success, the white paper noted.

"Successful engagement strategies require a scientific measurement approach, deep data insights and definitive actions tailored for each engagement tier," author Barbara Reilly, Ph.D., senior vice president of employee, nurse and physician engagement at Press Ganey, said in an announcement. "To build a high-performing organization, healthcare leaders need a focused understanding of where to drive change in order to create and sustain an engaged, patient-centered culture that reduces stress for caregivers and suffering for patients."

Critical drivers of engagement include:

The relationship between employee engagement and key patient experience performance metrics, including "likelihood to recommend"

Behaviors and best practices that distinguish high-performing organizations committed to sustained improvement

Actionable strategies driven by engagement levels to help build and sustain high-performing teams

Hospitals around the country are struggling to combat problems related to high staff turnover rates and employee dissatisfaction. A 2015 survey found that 3 out of 4 U.S. healthcare workers would leave their current positions for jobs with better pay.

Reilly said that the way to improve workforce relations is to adhere to the same types of data-driven, collaborative methods currently being used to improve patient experience.
