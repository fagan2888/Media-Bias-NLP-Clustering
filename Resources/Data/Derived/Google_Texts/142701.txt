The 2014 FIL World Lacrosse Championships in Denver, Colorado, which began on July 10 and ends July 19, showcased the best lacrosse teams around the world.

The Iroquois Nationals’ debut was much anticipated after they were denied entry into England for the 2010 games based on the country’s refusal to acknowledge the team’s Iroquois passports. As a result, the team did not compete at the world championships in Manchester.

But this year, a much happier story unfolded for the Nationals. The team competed against the world’s top players from Australia, Canada, England, Japan and the USA in the top tier Blue Division. They were the only indigenous team to compete as a sovereign nation.

Their final game is set for July 19 against Australia for the third place title in the championships. The Nationals beat Australia in their first matchup on July 14, 12-10.

Following the Nationals game at 2:00pm MST, team USA faces Canada for the championship win at 7:00pm MST.
