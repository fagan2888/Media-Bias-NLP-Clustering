Really vast. Iowa and New Hampshire? Not so much.\n\nThey\u2019re definitely not big enough for two ambitious Texas Republicans, both laying the groundwork to run for president, which may explain the elbows that Gov. Rick Perry and Sen. Ted Cruz have directed at each other.\n\nThe latest jab came Thursday, when Perry dismissed the idea that Cruz \u2014 for all his star power \u2014 has remade Texas politics. \u201cWe all get our 15 seconds of fame, right?\u201d he asked. \u201cWhether it was Ann Richards or whether it was George W. Bush or whether it was Rick Perry or whether it\u2019s Ted Cruz. \u2026 Ask me in eight years if Senator Cruz has made an impact on the state.\u201d\n\nWhen it comes to 2016, only one of these Texans can survive, at most. Since they occupy pretty much the same turf \u2014 the states\u2019 rights, anti-Obama, tea party side of the GOP tent \u2014 they\u2019re natural rivals.\n\nPerry spent an hour with Washington reporters Thursday over lunch hosted by the Christian Science Monitor, itself a sign of his ambitions. It\u2019s a venue that Cruz has yet to tackle.\n\nIdeologically, there\u2019s hardly any daylight between the two. Both would drastically curb federal power. Both revile President Barack Obama\u2019s policies on gun control, border security and energy. Perry has resisted the health care overhaul; Cruz triggered a government shutdown with demands to repeal Obamacare.\n\nPerry was no fan of that. Stumping in Iowa a few weeks after the government reopened, he called that episode a sign of dysfunction in Washington.\n\n\u201cEverybody gets to go out and do their thing. That\u2019s his thing. My thing is governing,\u201d he said.\n\nPerry\u2019s calling card is job creation. He barnstorms the country luring companies to Texas. He boasted Thursday that since he became governor, 37 percent of new private sector jobs created in the country were in Texas, thanks to the business climate he has cultivated.\n\n\u201cThink about that. One out of 12 people in America live in Texas. And 3 out of 8 new jobs,\u201d he said.\n\nIt\u2019s a boast that draws a snort from Cruz.\n\n\u201cNothing drives me crazier than politicians who run around talking about the jobs they\u2019ve created,\u201d the freshman senator said a month ago in Austin. \u201cPoliticians are very good at killing jobs, but they don\u2019t create jobs.\u201d\n\nThe men and their staffs are careful to avoid tough, direct criticism. Cruz press secretary Catherine Frazier, whose previous boss was Perry, offered this when asked about the governor\u2019s latest volley: \u201cSenator Cruz has the utmost respect for Governor Perry and his leadership in Texas. He is proud to partner with him in representing 26 million Texans and defending the conservative principles that have made and will keep Texas strong for generations to come.\u201d\n\nAt this month\u2019s state GOP convention in Fort Worth, Perry ran a distant fourth, far behind Cruz, in a presidential straw poll.\n\nStill, he\u2019s eyeing another run. Calling his 2012 campaign \u201cpainful\u201d and \u201cvery humbling,\u201d he vowed that he would be far more ready in 2016, mentally and physically. If he does run, he said, it would be because \u201cI\u2019m a patriot. \u2026 I\u2019m a competitor.\u201d\n\nHe offered a scathing critique of the Obama administration on border security and climate policy.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not a scientist,\u201d he said. But he insisted blaming carbon dioxide for climate change is far from settled science. \u201cShort term, I\u2019m substantially more concerned about Iran changing the temperature of New York\u201d \u2014 an allusion to a nuclear attack \u2014 than about the possible impact of climate change decades from now.\n\nFollow Todd J.
