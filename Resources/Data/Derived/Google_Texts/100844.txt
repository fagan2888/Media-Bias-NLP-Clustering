Washington (CNN) Despite stagnant poll numbers and gathering momentum behind his establishment rivals, Jeb Bush is getting critical reinforcements from a major figure in the financial industry.

According to a report from the Wall Street Journal , former AIG CEO Maurice "Hank" Greenberg is donating $10 million to the super PAC supporting Bush's presidential campaign. In an interview Wednesday with the newspaper, Greenberg didn't deny making the contribution but declined to discuss it.

"Right to Rise Super USA," the super PAC receiving Greenberg's donation, raised over $100 million in the opening weeks of the campaign and pledged a "shock and awe" political effort that would overwhelm Bush's rivals and lock up the GOP nomination.

But despite the super PAC already spending a staggering $47 million on advertising, as reported by the Wall Street Journal, Bush's numbers have cratered since the beginning of his bid. The avalanche of advertising from "Right to Rise USA" has done little to move the needle in a campaign crowded by a large GOP field and dominated by media magnet Donald Trump.

The donation comes not a moment too soon, with the high-stakes contests in Iowa and New Hampshire now weeks away, and Bush and his allies need all the help they can get to make an impression with primary voters and breathe life into a struggling campaign.
