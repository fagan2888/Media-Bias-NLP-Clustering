Nowhere is that tougher than in Stapleton \u2013 Denver\u2019s most popular new community, where parks, restaurants and new schools lure buyers willing to reach into the $400s, $500s and $600s for new products. But Stapleton\u2019s master developer Forest City has brought in builders who are going the extra mile to create opportunities for first-time and other deserving buyers to get out of renting, into owning a home.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cEverybody in Denver needs to be worried about affordability,\u201d says Gene Myers, CEO of New Town Builders, up for a Grand Award for Innovation from the U.S. Department of Energy for its trend-setting, super energy-efficient designs in Stapleton\u2019s Conservatory Green and Willow Park East neighborhoods. Myers has seen stories ranking Denver as becoming the least-affordable market that\u2019s not on a coast \u2013 ahead in price from other powerhouse areas like Austin and Phoenix. Homebuilding, he adds, has an outsized impact on Colorado\u2019s economy \u2013 one that could turn negative.\n\n\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, New Town has been working to keep some of its Stapleton plans affordable since 2006 \u2013 including innovative row homes, where about one of six plans is an income-qualified unit. Myers says all of his buyers have liked the arrangement; while he\u2019s found that potential buyers on the affordable-end have been willing to save a little more and reach a little further for the opportunity to live in Stapleton, than they might have for a resale home elsewhere.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile Myers looks ahead to another 160 income-qualified units in Willow Park East and Conservatory Green, \u2018Gete\u2019 Mekonnen with Northeast Denver Housing Center, a non-profit, is wrapping up a sell-out of 18 Spruce Townhomes in Stapleton\u2019s Central Park West, where prices started in the mid-$100s. \u201cAt Stapleton, it\u2019s about more than housing,\u201d he says. \u201cThe matrix that makes it successful involves how close you are to schools, shopping and jobs.\u201d NDHC already has contracts on another 20 units, and is looking at 20-to-30 more for a site now in planning.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWe encourage families to talk with us,\u201d he adds, noting that NDHC has free counseling on routes to home ownership in association with CHFA and organizations. \u201cIt\u2019s always good to be educated about what it takes.\u201d On previous income-qualified offerings from either builder, buyers have been eligible to buy if income was no larger than $51,150 for a household of two; $63,900 for a household of four.\n\n\n\n\n\nMekonnen and Myers say it\u2019s important to families with limited incomes to choose locations like Stapleton where jobs, shopping and recreation are close, keeping commuting and transportation costs low. \u201cThe stability of homeownership is what it\u2019s all about,\u201d says Myers. \u201cKids are able to thrive in one school, letting them stay put, where teachers can know who they are.\u201d To visit the whole range of affordable offerings in Stapleton\u2019s newest neighborhoods, from central Stapleton take Central Park Boulevard north past I-70, to Northfield Boulevard and turn left a half mile to Uinta, then turn right on 49th Place.\n\n\n\n\n\nWHERE: New Town Builders, and Northeast Denver Housing Center, each continuing to create affordably priced homes in Stapleton, Forest City\u2019s master-planned community with 55 parks, 38 miles of trails, more than 100 shops/stores, 15 minutes from downtown; Commuter Rail arrives 2016\n\n\n\n\n\nPHONE: 855-Go-4-Tour (855-464-8687)\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "As rents rise rapidly, Stapleton\u2019s builders are determined to bring affordable new homes to Denver\u2019s most popular community", "title": "As rents rise rapidly, Stapleton\u2019s builders are determined to bring affordable new homes to Denver\u2019s most popular community", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/06/05/as-rents-rise-rapidly-stapletons-builders-are-determined-to-bring-affordable-new-homes-to-denvers-most-popular-community/", "image": {"width": 300, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150605_012147_Stapleton-New-Town-Builders-Myers-Schwaderer-Sun-6-7-15.jpg", "height": 224}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2015-06-05T13:22:45+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-24T11:35:15+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Nowhere is that tougher than in Stapleton \u2013 Denver\u2019s most popular new community, where parks, restaurants and new schools lure buyers willing to reach into the $400s, $500s and $600s for new products.\nMyers has seen stories ranking Denver as becoming the least-affordable market that\u2019s not on a coast \u2013 ahead in price from other powerhouse areas like Austin and Phoenix.\nWHERE: New Town Builders, and Northeast Denver Housing Center, each continuing to create affordably priced homes in Stapleton, Forest City\u2019s master-planned community with 55 parks, 38 miles of trails, more than 100 shops/stores, 15 minutes from downtown; Commuter Rail arrives 2016PHONE: 855-Go-4-Tour (855-464-8687)\nHomebuilding, he adds, has an outsized impact on Colorado\u2019s economy \u2013 one that could turn negative.\nMeanwhile, New Town has been working to keep some of its Stapleton plans affordable since 2006 \u2013 including innovative row homes, where about one of six plans is an income-qualified unit."}
