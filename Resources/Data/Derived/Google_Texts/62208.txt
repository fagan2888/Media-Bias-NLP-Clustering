Greg Brannon, a former doctor, current Tea Party candidate, and one-time recipient of a coveted endorsement from Sen. Rand Paul, has already been revealed to be rather out there, shall we say, in his views. But a new scoop from BuzzFeed shows that Brannon’s paranoia, fondness for conspiracy theories and general loopiness is even more all-consuming than was previously believed.

Today, Brannon is within striking distance of winning the GOP nomination to the U.S. Senate. But back in 2012, Brannon, while speaking on local radio in North Carolina, had different, scarier things on his mind.

Referencing a non-binding U.N. sustainable development plan that’s long been a bugaboo of the conspiracy-addled political fringe, Brannon railed against Agenda 21, Obamacare, the National Defense Authorization Act and the global conspiracy to make him sick through vaccinations.

“This scam of Agenda 21, this scam of humans are poisoning the earth, is a scam,” Brannon explained. “They are using that to control you, to control me, to control life.”
