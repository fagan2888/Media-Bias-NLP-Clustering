It's become a Tucson Christmas tradition: Thousands of children and their families are expected to be lined up early Sunday morning for what is known as "Ramon's Miracle on 31st Street."

This is the 45th year founder Ramon Gonzales is hosting this event and he said it's actually gotten so popular, the event has been held at the giant AVA Amphitheater at Casino Del Sol, located off Valencia Road on the city's southeast side, for the past four years.

Gonzales and with several volunteers spent all day Saturday making gift bags, organizing toys, and making sure everything was set before the big day.

Though there were mountains of toys for children of all ages, both for boys and girls, Gonzales is afraid there still isn't enough for the nearly 10,000 children expected to show up.

So he's asking the community for help. Gonzales said they need more toys mainly for toddlers and pre-teens, both for boys and girls.

Last year, they had about 25 bicycles to give away. This year, they only have three, Gonzales said.

To donate a gift, contact Ramon Gonzales at (520) 971-8271. Donations can be dropped off at 2019 W. Ajo Way or any time during the event Sunday, at the AVA Amphitheater at Casino Del Sol, located at 5565 W. Valencia Road.

The event is scheduled to begin at 9 a.m.
