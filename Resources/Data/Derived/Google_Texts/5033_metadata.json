More than 25 nations, including the U.S., are taking part in search efforts across an area of 2.24 million nautical miles, from central Asia to the southern Indian Ocean.\n\nBut no one can find it.\n\nRelated: Four Other Planes That Vanished Mysteriously\n\nDid the pilots bring it down or hijack it? Were they forced to change course? New material from the Thai government on Tuesday strengthened the notion that the jet veered sharply westward after communication was lost \u2013 but the reasons remain unclear.\n\nPatrick Smith, an airline pilot, air travel blogger and author of Cockpit Confidential, has been following the developments and says that some of the wilder theories about what occurred can be dismissed, while one can\u2019t \u2013 at least not yet:\n\nThe Radar Ruse. One notion is that the missing jet \u201ctucked up underneath a Singapore Airlines 777, causing the two planes\u2019 radar signatures to appear as one,\u201d reports Smith.\n\nThe theory is from a self-described hobby pilot and aviation enthusiast, Keith Ledgerwood, who wrote on his Tumblr that \u2013 disguised beneath the other plane and with its communication systems turned off \u2013 the Malaysia jet flew on, undetected for hours until it finally broke away and likely crashed somewhere.\n\nThis idea, says Smith, fails to explain how the Malaysia jet could have completed its secret diversion without being seen once it separated from the Singapore flight \u2013 to say nothing of why such a difficult and elaborate plot would have been undertaken by someone in the first place.\n\nThe theory is really about \u201can aviation hobbyist showing off a little,\u201d says Smith. He says that if the Malaysia plane had been flying just below the Singapore 777, \u201cthe latter plane\u2019s radar altimeter, displaying physical distance to objects below, would have shown it.\u201d\n\nThe Hijacking Notion. The \u201clong history of air piracy did not begin and end with September 11th, 2001,\u201d says Smith. So \u201cit\u2019s important not to view every hijacking through the crucible of the 9/11 template. People hijack planes for different reasons \u2013 it may even have been a rogue crewmember.\u201d\n\nIf Flight 370 was hijacked, as some investigators have suggested, Smith says there are still many unanswered questions. \u201cDid the plane land somewhere, possibly to be used later as an airborne weapon of some kind, perhaps loaded with a nuclear or biological weapon? I seriously doubt it.\u201d\n\nHe suspects the plane instead crashed into the ocean and will be discovered there eventually. \u201cRemote as some airports are, none are small or unwatched enough to accept a Boeing 777 without it being obvious,\u201d he says.\n\nThe Disintegration Idea. Smith calls this idea \u201cwacky.\u201d \u201cWould it be possible for the 777 to have climbed clear out of the atmosphere, so high that \u2018it disintegrated,\u2019 went into orbit or otherwise became impossible to track or locate?\u201d\n\nThe answer, he says, is a definite no. \u201cTotally impossible. At a certain altitude, a plane\u2019s engines will no longer provide enough power and the wings will no longer provide enough lift. The plane will no longer be able to sustain flight. All commercial passenger jets have maximum certified cruising altitudes below 50,000 feet or so. Even this altitude isn\u2019t always reachable. The maximum altitude at a given time depends on the plane\u2019s weight, the air temperature and other factors.\u201d\n\nThe Emergency Response. Here\u2019s one theory that actually merits attention. This theory explains Flight 370\u2019s abrupt off-course turn as a response to an in-flight emergency of some kind, perhaps an electrical fire or a tire that went aflame in the front landing gear.\n\nPilot Chris Goodfellow advanced this idea on Google+ and then in Wired, saying that, while aiming to make an emergency landing, the crew was overcome by smoke or fumes. With the autopilot on and its course reprogrammed, \u201cthe plane then continued on for a time before crashing.\u201d\n\nSmith says this theory \u201cis described as \u2018startlingly simple,\u2019 but there\u2019s nothing startling about it. Goodfellow, in fact, puts forth the same idea that I did\u201d several days ago.\n\nOn March 14, Smith wrote on his blog:\n\n\u201c\u2026Was the crew diverting to a nearby airport because of a fire or some other emergency? Did the plane crash shortly thereafter; or were the pilots overcome by smoke or fumes, at which point [the] plane continued for a length of time? It\u2019d be interesting to see what some of their divert options were at the point when the jet fell out of contact\u2026\u201d\n\nSmith says that other people have also suggested \u201cthe same thing, more or less, once it was revealed that the plane had made an off-course turn. This remains a perfectly plausible theory \u2014 a lot more plausible than some of those we\u2019ve been hearing.\u201d\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Ten days after it vanished, the theories about what happened to", "title": "4 Wild Theories About Malaysia Airlines Flight 370", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/03/18/Malaysia-Airlines-Flight-370-Four-Wild-Theories", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/slides/03122014_POTD.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/03/18/Malaysia-Airlines-Flight-370-Four-Wild-Theories", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/slides/03122014_POTD.jpg", "creator": "@maurmack", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Ten days after it vanished, the theories about what happened to", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd7fc7\"", "article_summary": "Ten days after it vanished, the theories about what happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 are traveling faster than a selfie at the Academy Awards.\nOne notion is that the missing jet \u201ctucked up underneath a Singapore Airlines 777, causing the two planes\u2019 radar signatures to appear as one,\u201d reports Smith.\nHe says that if the Malaysia plane had been flying just below the Singapore 777, \u201cthe latter plane\u2019s radar altimeter, displaying physical distance to objects below, would have shown it.\u201dThe Hijacking Notion.\nThe Beijing-bound Boeing 777 with 227 passengers and 12 crewmembers on board is the subject of intense worldwide scrutiny.\nThe maximum altitude at a given time depends on the plane\u2019s weight, the air temperature and other factors.\u201dThe Emergency Response."}
