The voters spoke, this dictators agenda was decisively rejected. It's officially RINO season on the 162 traitorous sellouts\n\n\"Republicants\" were elected in 2010, based on their \"PROMISE\" to stop Obamacare. only to have the GOP \"Leadership\" BETRAY us once again! I am SPEECHLESS! Totally stunned that we find ourselves in this same INSANE situation and we are always powerless to stop this! We need to start a petition to remove Boehner from the \"Betrayer of the House\" Position! IMMEDIATELY. Our country and way of life cannot survive if this is allowed to continue!\n\nI wonder how much Boehner was offered, or what they have on him to bring him to so badly betray the nation? He needs to be stripped of his office, impeached, and the same for Obama. The RINO's need to be dumped, for good.\n\nIt was preposterous to give the defeated Democrats anything except a stop-gap bill to fund the government through January, at which point the incoming Republican majorities should have exercised control over everything. If the Democrats don\u2019t like that deal, let them shut down the government in a fit of pique, and tell voters how they party they just threw out of power should be allowed to control their lives for an extra year. Not only would that be smart politics \u2013 giving the Republicans more fiscal leverage to stand up for America against Obama\u2019s amnesty, instead of just funding for the Department of Homeland Security \u2013 but it would represent more sensible and responsible government. All of this multi-trillion-dollar monstrosity is linked together; all of it should be on the table; funding for Obamacare and amnesty removed and the flab should be liposuctioned out of every agency at once in a comprehensive plan for fiscal sanity and increased American liberty.\n\nVoters also spoke when they reelected that \"dictator\" handily. Weird, huh?We're all going to die?Help us, Ted Cruz, you are our only hope!Woah, Republicans will control everything in January? Weird how I missed an entire presidential election!\n\nI am intrigued, however. How do you remove funding for not doing something?\n\n\n\nThe GOP fought for what is important to them. Protecting themselves by upping the donation caps of their donors to their PACs and paying off their Wall Street cronies. This unpopular nonsense was more important to them than fighting to retain what remains of our constitutional republic, instead choosing to accede to the executive's usurpation of their legislative authority.\n\nWe are at the \"awkward stage\". Too late to work\n\nwithin the system, but too early to shoot the bastards.\n\nRevolution is not murder.\n\nThe Declaration specifically authorized it and made it our Duty!\n\nWhen the banches of the federal goverment are routinely violating the Constitution and seizing powers that they are not allowed, then the federal government has no legal authority over the states or their citizens. By abrogating the Constitution, they have made themselves illegal.\n\nIs Boehner up for reelection on 2016?\n\nTimmy is there a Tea Party in your district? Call them and email them, prompt them to start a recall. Surely there is someone p*ssed off enough in your district?\n\nNO SURPRISE , NO BETRAYAL\n\nAs Palin alluded\n\nUntil our fellow CONSERVATIVES educate themselves enough to vote for conservatives in the PRIMARIES,\n\nNOTHING will change.\n\nTHEY are the problem, the RINOs who were elected are doing what they always have.\n\nGEORGE SOROS IS THE PUPPETMASTER TO OBAMA THE PUPPET. HE SAID HE WOULD MAKE THIS NATION SOCIALIST AND BY GOLLY HE IS!!!!! We need help in finding out how to rally together to stop this from happening to our children and grandchildren RIGHT THIS SECOND!!!!!!!!!!\n\nim guesing 0bumbas nsa has a nice dossier on all of these spineless wesels like boener. years ago they all probably had a strange person in black clothes walk up to them at a diner and put a manilla envelope on the table. inside were pics of them with a red ball in their mouth getting whipped in a hotel by some 400 pound woman. maybe them dressed like a boy scout getting spanked by some fat guy that looked like santa. maybe pics of them on a donor trip to the dominican where they had a 14 year old hooger girl sent to their cabana. im sure from injustice john roberts to boener they got a nice blackmail file to make them all dance like a circus monkey. has to be because these vile pigs couldnt be that shameless and crooked. i hope. liberals dont care since they celebrate and covet twisted behavior\n\n\"They\" didn't offer Boehner anything, or have anything on him. He is a member in good standing of \"they\". He acted in the best interests of the ruling elite and is as dependent on the \"stupidity\" of the American voters as the other supporters of big government, amnesty and Obamacare.\n\nIt is our stupidity, but also our helplessness! Lately not one leader appeared and said the things we want them, politicians, to do. Even Cruz and Lee, and Sarah don't mention the new party. That would be the only solution in the situation where we have leftist revolution going full frontal assault on America.\n\nInsanity is believing that the GOP leadership would Not BETRAY their promises. Those of us who have been paying attention since Bush 41 have seen this over and over and over again. Say one thing to get elected and then don't do what you say you'll do once you do get elected. We have done what we can! We voted. They have ignored us. Now what? Wait to vote again? As if that will change anything. The next election the D's are going to come in and trample the R's, if they keep this up. What should we focus on? Do what you can to take care of your family, your finances and your own life. These vermin will do NOTHING to help us in these areas. What is that melody I hear? I believe it is the fat lady warming up back stage!\n\nThose running for reelection should be primary'ed and defeated so that true conservatives are on the ballot. The real problem rears its ugly head if they win the primaries; then we're left without any meaningful choice as, one the one hand we'll get RINOs who'll sell out the country so that the MSM and the establishment will like them, and on the other hand we'll get DEMs who'll sell out the country to cement their power and usher in their Fascistic dreams...\n\nSimple... it's time for a Revolution. It is clear that Washington has no regard for the people of this country... ballots or bullets... I guess we now know ballots don't work.\n\nTHIS ^^^^ Nothing else will now work . WE vote in a ton of Repubs and still the speaker screws us !! Our government is so gone .It's all for Elites and to H_ll with us !!\n\nThis is more than an agenda. It's a not so silent coup. Your country has been taken over from the inside, and the Republicans won't help you. The best thing that can come out of that election is for Americans to stop being so naive, and dump the Republican party. It's even more dangerous than the Dems, because it lies to those who will believe. Now that you have seen the election - unless you see Palin, Paul, Cruz, and the others you believe in jump the corrupted Republican machine - you should no longer put your support behind them. You can use what you've seen to make the right choice. Choose America.\n\nDerpity, derpity, derp. It's over, the fat lady is singing. The only consequence elections have anymore is that the oligarchs have to spend more money buying the new batch. Chump change when you can print all the money you need and import new \"voters\".\n\nHow about a 2016 national landslide election to equal no other for Sarah Palin, POTUS elect! Once in office, ObamaScare and dozens of other socialist ProgLib programs, policies, departments will be \"dust in the wind\" in short order under a Palin administration! Let's reclaim our country!!\n\nI wanted to say that these repubics are very much in touch. First, we know that politicians in Russia, Turkey, Iceland, France, Greece (you name it) are corrupt. Why do we still believe that ours are not? Second, IMO, there are forces that pull all the strings. They give the money and tell the crooks and scum in politics: you do your Kabuki theater and we will continue our businesses, whether it is GM or Solyndra or Facebook or Comcast or AT&T, et al. They need us to go to work and politicians are making this spectacle and we are dumb enough to believe them that it is done for us, little people!\n\nYes, fascists/commies of the olden days are gone, these are neo-fascists/commies. They saw how the rulers in China and Russia changed the playbook and follow the pattern.\n\nIt is time for every good Conservative to quit the GOP and join the Independent American Party. The Independent American Party is the only conservative party in the USA.\n\nGod I dig her,,,, any chick that can drop an elk at 475yards in one pull is okay by me.. I'm picturing her pretty agreeable to scaring the wildlife away with a few cattle calls of her own !\n\nHouse republicans should nominate and elect Sarah Palin or Michelle Bachman speaker.\n\nGood point about Wall Street, actually. And yes, that provision allowing parties to raise more money for themselves? That's aimed directly at the teabaggers.What is it with conservatives and always wanting to shoot people?The Declaration of Independence is the BOSS OF YOU and says you have NO CHOICE but to shoot up John Boehner!The final arbiter about the Constitutionality of a law isn't the Supreme Court anymore. it's the Breitbart comments section.Bretibart commenters are so smart. Good thing they've taken on the duty of Constitutional interpretation.I can't wait for these Constitutional scholars to point to the Constitutional provision allowing for recalls of elected federal officials.Trashing the government?FOCUS! We're talking about Boehner here.You sure have given this A LOT of thought. Hmmm...The GOP is explicitly the party of Wall Street. Not sure why teabaggers pretend to be surprised by this.Remember Bob Reich's commando assault on the beaches of Jesusland? Conservative resistance is futile!Of course Republicans will do nothing to help you. THAT'S THEIR PLATFORM!Why oh why do Democrats have fascist dreams of everyone having health insurance, and Wall Street isn't able to trample on the taxpayers?And back to the bullets...Voting against the GOP is definitely the right choice for America.Wall Street thanks you for voting Republican!Yeah, how about that! Sigh. God doesn't love me enough to make it happen.All joking aside, a truly populist Democratic Party, in addition to better exciting our base,make some inroads with some of these disaffected conservative types. If our party sounded consistently like Elizabeth Warren, the impossible could happen.Ah, you say such sweet things, but come election time, you always go back to your true love.Who wants to hear more about the mating calls of conservative men?I'm sure we could find bipartisan agreement to make that happen.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Daily Kos", "description": "Today's source material:\n\n\n\n1.
