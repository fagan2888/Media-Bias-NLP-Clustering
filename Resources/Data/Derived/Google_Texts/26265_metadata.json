The tunes here include the Lemonheads\u2019 peppy version of \u201cMrs. Robinson\u201d; Simple Minds\u2019 gruff take on the Beach Boys\u2019 \u201cSloop John B\u201d (the perfect backdrop to a sinking yacht); and the theme from Goldfinger, redone by Sharon Jones & the Dap-Kings as a wedding ballad.\n\nIf Scorsese goes for baroque in his depiction of wretched excess \u2014 how many times must we watch someone snort cocaine, toss cash like confetti or cavort with hookers before we get the idea? \u2014 so be it. This master of contemporary cinema has earned the right to be self-indulgent, even at the risk of alienating his audience. And for every repetitive episode, there\u2019s usually a moment of sublime insanity to make up for it.\n\nAs for the extended scene in which a Quaalude-addled DiCaprio tumbles down a country club\u2019s brick steps and contorts himself into a pretzel before performing the Heimlich maneuver on a choking Hill, you\u2019ll view it as the breaking point or the comedic highlight of this already-gonzo film.\n\nJordan Belfort\u2019s eventual rebirth as a motivational speaker provides a key segue to the heedless wealth and ever-shrinking middle class that continue to bedevil the U.S. economy today. No one ever went broke overestimating the public\u2019s hunger for get-rich schemes \u2014 not least of them Martin Scorsese.", "article_metadata": {"page_title": "'The Wolf of Wall Street': Not for the Sheepish", "estimated_publish_date": "2016-01-29", "Last-Modified": "2015-03-25T14:55:54.875-04:00", "keywords": "Leonardo DiCaprio movies, Martin Scorsese movies, dark comedies, Martin Scorsese mob movies, 1980s excess, movies for grownups, Leonardo DiCaprio new movie, Martin Scorsese new movie", "houseAds": "commercial", "paywallStatus": "off", "isArticle": "true", "author": "Susan Wloszczyna", "comments": "on", "source": "aarp_org", "type": "info", "description": "Scorsese, DiCaprio cash in with a darkly comedic true story of brokers gone wild", "s43": "31.Entertainment|MyPersonalTime", "robots": "index,follow", "Subject1": "DCSubjects:Entertainment/Movies for Grownups/Movie Styles/Comedy", "fb": {"app_id": 114175878660191}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "language": "english", "og": {"site_name": "AARP", "description": "Scorsese, DiCaprio cash in with a darkly comedic true story of brokers gone wild", "title": "Martin Scorsese's Wolf of Wall Street Movie Review,Trailer Stars Leona... - AARP", "url": "http://www.aarp.org/entertainment/movies-for-grownups/info-12-2013/leonardo-dicaprio-wolf-wall-street-movie-review.html", "image": "http://cdn.aarp.net/content/dam/aarp/entertainment/movies-for-grownups/2013-12/200-leonardo-dicaprio-wolf-wall-street.imgcache.rev1387817644688.jpg", "type": "article"}, "contentId": "/content/aarpe/en/home/entertainment/movies-for-grownups/info-12-2013/leonardo-dicaprio-wolf-wall-street-movie-review", "aarpeContent": "true", "IALevel1": "entertainment", "IALevel2": "movies-for-grownups", "IALevel3": "info-12-2013", "action": "read", "dateToday": "2016-05-24"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9b49\"", "article_summary": "No one ever went broke overestimating the public\u2019s hunger for get-rich schemes \u2014 not least of them Martin Scorsese.\nThis master of contemporary cinema has earned the right to be self-indulgent, even at the risk of alienating his audience.\nAnd for every repetitive episode, there\u2019s usually a moment of sublime insanity to make up for it.\nAnd what would a Marty movie be without a killer soundtrack?\nThe tunes here include the Lemonheads\u2019 peppy version of \u201cMrs."}
