Unfortunately, interpreting exactly what the leaders of the Russian government mean when they make public statements can be a bit tricky these days.\n\nFor instance, with regard to the Russian invasion of Ukraine\u2019s Crimean peninsula, words that have historically been translated as \u201clocal self-defense units\u201d have turned out to actually mean \u201cRussian soldiers in uniforms stripped of insignia.\u201d\n\nRelated: 13 Deadly Weapons Russia Has Sent To Syria\n\nSimilarly, in early comments about Russia\u2019s object in Syria, Putin himself promised that the objective was to defeat \u201cISIS.\u201d As it turned out, in that context \u201cISIS\u201d actually meant \u201canybody that Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad needs us to drop bombs on to ensure he retains a hold on power.\u201d\n\nOn Monday, new remarks by Admiral Vladimir Komoyedov, who chairs the Defense and Security Committee in the Russian Federation Council, discussed the future of Russian involvement in Syria using another word with a questionable definition: \u201cvolunteers.\u201d\n\nSpeaking to the government-run Interfax news service on Monday, Komoyedov said, \u201cIt is likely that groups of Russian volunteers will appear in the ranks of the Syrian army as combat participants.\u201d\n\nNow, to anyone who has been paying attention to the ongoing rebellion in eastern Ukraine, what exactly constitutes a Russian \u201cvolunteer\u201d is very unclear indeed. Confronted with overwhelming evidence that uniformed Russian troops were operating inside Ukraine and engaging in combat with Ukrainian government forces in support of the separatists, Putin repeatedly referred to the soldiers there as volunteers. Any enlisted Russian soldiers fighting there, he said, were probably just on vacation.\n\nRelated: Why Donald Trump Is Vladimir Putin\u2019s Favorite Presidential Candidate\n\nHowever, evidence collected by international monitors, including the social media posts of individual Russian soldiers, made it clear that the so-called volunteers were in Ukraine at the orders of their superiors.\n\nSo, a week after one of Putin\u2019s surrogates assured the Russian people that the Kremlin\u2019s military intervention in Syria would be limited to airstrikes, another Russian lawmaker appears to be opening the door to the introduction of ground troops.\n\nInterfax reported that Komoyedov said volunteers fighting in Syria might be motivated by \u201cideas\u201d or \u201cOf course, money most likely.\u201d Interfax suggested that volunteers might be paid as much as $50 per day.\n\nAlso on Monday, Komoyedov said that it is possible that Russia will escalate its involvement in Syria to include the use of naval power. The Russian Navy has several ships positioned in the eastern Mediterranean, including the guided missile cruiser Moscow.\n\n\u201cArtillery strikes have not been ruled out,\u201d he said, according to the state-run RIA Novosti news service. \u201cThe ships are prepared \u2026 But there is no sense in doing this yet, the terrorists are located where artillery can't reach them.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "A top Russian official on Monday opened the door to the possibility that Russian \u201cvolunteers\u201d could soon be on the ground in Syria, fighting beside dictator Bashar al-Assad\u2019s forces.
