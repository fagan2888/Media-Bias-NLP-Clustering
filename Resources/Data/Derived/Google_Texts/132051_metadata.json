Hence the term \u201cObamacare.\u201d\n\nBut his energy and climate change efforts are equally ambitious.\n\nTake his Clean Power Plan, for example, which sets a very aggressive goal for the United States to source 28% of its power from renewable sources by 2030.\n\nI\u2019m not going to get into the scientific arguments over climate change. Rather, let\u2019s look at the unforeseen effects that the Clean Power Plan is already having on many Americans.\n\nTwo controversies have already bubbled to the surface\u2026\n\nControversy #1: Renewable Energy Transmission Lines\n\nThe bottom line with any kind of power is that it needs to get from where it\u2019s generated to the people who need it.\n\nThat requires transmission lines. Lots of them.\n\nEarlier this year, a report from Edison Electric Institute, the utility trade group, found that of the almost $48 billion in U.S. transmission projects through 2025, 46% of them are aimed at getting renewable power to the masses.\n\nBut some of them are already stirring up a hornet\u2019s nest.\n\nFor example, Texas-based Clean Line Energy Partners has riled landowners in Arkansas and Missouri. The company builds transmission lines to carry solar- and wind-generated power\u2026 but who wants an electric transmission line running through their property?\n\nNaturally, environmental groups that oppose the Keystone XL oil pipeline and other conventional energy projects firmly support these clean energy transmission line projects.\n\nAs it is, \u201cNIMBY\u201d is coming back to bite these environmental groups, with the proposals receiving pushback from landowners and state governments alike.\n\nSo the companies behind such projects are turning to the federal government. They want the Feds to use eminent domain to override private property rights and just seize the necessary land to build the clean power transmission network.\n\nControversy #2: Higher Electric Rates\n\nThe current U.S. electric grid is a real feat of engineering. More than 3,200 utilities come together to make up the grid, distributing power over 2.7 million miles of power lines.\n\nWith greater use of renewable power, such as rooftop solar systems and increased energy conservation, the end result has been lower electric usage.\n\nGreat, right?\n\nWell, not if you\u2019re an electric utility and your main source of income is what you charge customers for usage!\n\nThat damage is starting to get real for many utilities. Their decades-long business model is shorting out.\n\nSo much so, in fact, that the system of utilities charging customers based on electric usage is actually being phased out.\n\nInstead, utilities are increasingly turning towards the use of fixed monthly fees, no matter how much power customers use.\n\nAnd they\u2019re raising these fees by double-digit percentages \u2013 to $25 or more per month.\n\nThe vice president of the non-profit Edison Foundation, Lisa Wood, told The Wall Street Journal, \u201cThe [electricity] grid is becoming a more complex machine, and there needs to be an equitable sharing of its costs.\u201d\n\nUh-oh.\n\nEvery time I hear the words \u201cfair share\u201d or \u201cequitable share,\u201d I know it means more money out of my pocket.\n\nBut there\u2019s no denying that most of an electric utility\u2019s costs are fixed. They need a certain amount of income to survive. Industry analysts believe utilities need to raise sales volume by 1% annually just to maintain the grid system.\n\nBut sales are decreasing, not increasing. So now we have rapidly rising \u201cservice availability\u201d fees to pay every month in order to maintain our electric grid system.\n\nIf you think it\u2019s unfair that you conserve energy, or use less by yourself than a family of four, yet still be forced to pay a fixed fee, you\u2019re not alone. Turns out maintaining a \u201clegacy\u201d is expensive.\n\nGood investing,\n\nTim Maverick", "article_metadata": {"description": "The increasing use of renewable energy is hitting home with many Americans.
