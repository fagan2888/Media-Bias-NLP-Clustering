He called for tolerance and opposition to \u201cinjustice, discrimination,\u201d and defense of religious liberty.\n\nCheers rose from crowds outside the White House perimeter, and the assembled dignitaries applauded.\n\nThe pope commended Obama for his efforts to combat global warming while there is time to act, knowing as he did that Republicans and some Democrats oppose the administration\u2019s climate change initiatives.\n\nSpeaking repeatedly about a \u201ccommon home\u201d shared by people around the world and the responsibility to protect God\u2019s planetary creation, Francis aligned himself with the American president.\n\n\u201cI find it encouraging that you are proposing an initiative for reducing air pollution,\u201d he told Obama as dragonflies danced above the throngs and a squirrel scampered along the limbs of a shade tree.\n\n\u201cIt seems clear to me also that climate change is a problem we can no longer [leave] to our future generations,\u201d he continued. \u201cSuch change demands on our part a serious and responsible recognition.\u201d\n\nWithout specifically naming Cuba and its normalized relations with the United States and the Vatican\u2019s role in reaching out to the Castro government, the pope urged U.S. leaders to \u201cmend broken relationships\u201d and \u201copen new doors.\u201d\n\n\u201cI would like all men and women of goodwill in this great nation to support the efforts of the international community to protect the vulnerable in our world and to stimulate integral and inclusive models of development so that our brothers and sisters everywhere may know the blessings of peace and prosperity, which God wills for all his children,\u201d he added.\n\nThe pontiff spoke of the world\u2019s poor and vulnerable as \u201cexcluded,\u201d and he borrowed from Martin Luther King Jr.\u2019s \u201cI have a dream\u201d speech to evoke a compact America\u2019s leaders owed their citizens. And those citizens rose up to collect.\n\nIn 1963, the civil rights leader said America had defaulted on the \u201cpromissory note\u201d represented by the Constitution and Declaration of Independence in denying citizens, especially African-Americans, their rights.\n\nStanding before America\u2019s first African-American president, the pope referenced the country\u2019s history of racism, slavery and segregation to make a broader point about embracing the excluded and marginalized.\n\n\u201cTo use a telling phrase of the Rev. Martin Luther King, we can say that we have \u2018defaulted on a promissory note\u2019 and now is the time to honor it,\u201d Francis said. Injured and overlooked, the environment is issuing \u201ccries to heaven,\u201d and \u201cpowerfully strikes our homes, our cities, our societies,\u201d he said.\n\nObama\u2019s welcome statement highlighted topics about which he and the pontiff agree, including climate change, Cuba, and peace through diplomacy. He ignored rifts with the Catholic Church over same-sex marriage and abortion rights.\n\nLike Francis, the president spoke of defending religious liberty \u2013 a topic about which the administration and the church have sparred in the past because of the Affordable Care Act\u2019s mandated contraception coverage.\n\n\u201cWe cherish religious liberty,\u201d Obama assured the pope. \u201cIt was the basis for so much of what brought [the United States] together. \u2026 But around the world at this very moment, children of God, including Christians, are targeted and killed because of their faith,\u201d he added. \u201cBelievers are prevented from gathering at their places of worship and the faithful are imprisoned and churches are destroyed.\u201d\n\nThe president, praising Francis prior to a private meeting in the Oval Office, said Americans of all faiths admire the pontiff\u2019s moral leadership.\n\n\u201cYou remind us that in the eyes of God, our measure as individuals and our measure as a society is not determined by wealth or power or station or celebrity,\u201d Obama said, \u201cbut how well we hew to Scripture's call to lift the poor and the marginalized.\u201d\n\nObama asserts that he and the popular Francis share \u201cvalues\u201d and perspectives that move beyond religion, making a president and a pope valuable allies in an unsettled period in history.\n\n\u201cWe love you, Pope Francis!\u201d a man shouted at the conclusion of the South Lawn pomp.\n\nThe president smiled.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Pope Francis lost no time advocating for the Earth\u2019s delicate climate and for immigrants and \u201cthe excluded\u201d during brief remarks on the White House lawn Wednesday morning. \nAs...", "title": "Pope Francis, Obama Cite Common Causes | RealClearPolitics", "fragment": "!", "twitter": {"site": "@RealClearNews", "card": "summary"}, "og": {"url": "http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2015/09/23/pope_francis_obama_cite_common_causes_128191.html", "image": "http://images.rcp.realclearpolitics.com/321773_5_.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Pope Francis lost no time advocating for the Earth\u2019s delicate climate and for immigrants and \u201cthe excluded\u201d during brief remarks on the White House lawn Wednesday morning. \nAs...", "title": "Pope Francis, Obama Cite Common Causes | RealClearPolitics"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1415921935346245}, "tweetmeme-title": "Pope Francis, Obama Cite Common Causes | RealClearPolitics", "keywords": "immigration,u.s.-cuba relations,climate change,Barack\n  Obama,Pope Francis,", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdacda\"", "article_summary": "\u201cWe love you, Pope Francis!\u201d a man shouted at the conclusion of the South Lawn pomp.\nObama\u2019s welcome statement highlighted topics about which he and the pontiff agree, including climate change, Cuba, and peace through diplomacy.\n\u201cIt seems clear to me also that climate change is a problem we can no longer [leave] to our future generations,\u201d he continued.\nPope Francis lost no time advocating for the Earth\u2019s delicate climate and for immigrants and \u201cthe excluded\u201d during brief remarks on the White House lawn Wednesday morning.\nThe pope commended Obama for his efforts to combat global warming while there is time to act, knowing as he did that Republicans and some Democrats oppose the administration\u2019s climate change initiatives."}
