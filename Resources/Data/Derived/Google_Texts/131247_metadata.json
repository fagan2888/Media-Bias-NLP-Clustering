Will it require a procedural vote to overcome a filibuster? How much support it will have in the Senate and then the House? That\u2019s according to its author, Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.), chairman of the Commerce Committee.\n\nAll those factors depend on the answer to one other question: What exact language is going into the provision on clean energy tax credits? Lawmakers have mentioned geothermal, fuel cell and biomass energy sources, but they have been vague on the specifics. Meanwhile, other industry advocates have called for their clean energy sources to be included, including carbon-capture technology.\n\nDemocrats threatened on Tuesday to block the entire FAA bill if it doesn\u2019t include the energy tax provisions they said were mistakenly left out of last year\u2019s catchall bill that extended tax credits for wind and solar power. The deal to include the left-out provisions was already set, according to Sens. Harry Reid (D-Nev.) and Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), and the tax title in the FAA bill will simply fix that mistake.\n\nBut Thune and other Republicans have said it\u2019s not quite as simple as copying and pasting the excluded tax language into this particular bill. The FAA bill\u2019s tax title is still under negotiation and it\u2019s not clear exactly which clean energy sources will be included, Thune said.\n\nDemocrats have already signaled their support for the underlying FAA bill by voting to allow debate on the measure. But until the details are worked out on the tax title, the bill\u2019s path forward isn\u2019t entirely clear.\n\n\u201cThe sooner that thing can get released, and everybody has a chance to react to it and look at it and decide what they want to do in terms of amendments, the sooner I think we can get through the broader package,\u201d Thune told reporters Thursday.\n\nThune expects the negotiations to go on through next week, and a final vote could be forthcoming then.\n\nWhile Schumer said the missing tax credits are for geothermal, fuel cell and biomass energy sources, Thune said discussions were focused on Section 48 of the Internal Revenue Code, which includes geothermal power, fuel cell, microturbines, combined heat and power systems and small wind energy.\n\nLobbyists for these various factions of the energy industry are watching the back-and-forth with keen interest. Nobody quite knows what to expect. Curt Beaulieu, a senior counsel at Bracewell LLP, which represents members of the geothermal and fuel cell industries, said it\u2019s not entirely clear which credits will apply to residential or commercial power systems.\n\nMoreover, there are two sections of the Internal Revenue Code that Democrats say were also supposed to be included in last year\u2019s package, Beaulieu said. Section 45 includes tax credits for a wide range of energy sources, including biomass and some hydropower. And Section 25(D) includes solar, small wind, geothermal and fuel cell energy sources.\n\nWith various types of clean energy sources being tossed about, it\u2019s unclear what types Democrats are really asking to be included in the FAA bill to make amends for last year\u2019s \u201cmistake.\u201d Not to mention that some Republicans say it wasn\u2019t as much of a mistake as Reid and Schumer have described. Now that the discussion of green energy tax credits has begun, other groups, including carbon-capture advocates, have asked lawmakers for consideration.\n\nThe FAA bill by itself is uncontroversial and has support from both parties. But the possibility of an ever-growing list of energy tax credits could threaten its livelihood, especially in the Republican-dominated House, Thune said.\n\n\u201cI think the narrower you keep this, and the truer to whatever agreements there had been \u2014 either informal or formal \u2014 in the past, the easier it will be to get this across the finish line,\u201d he said. \u201cIf this thing becomes a Christmas tree, then you\u2019re going to start running into objections from both sides.\u201d\n\nThere already have been objections from conservative groups including Americans for Prosperity, Heritage Action for America and Americans for Tax Reform.\n\nAmericans for Prosperity is \u201cstrongly leaning\u201d toward issuing a \u201ckey vote\u201d alert calling on members to oppose the bill, said Director of Federal Affairs Chrissy Harbin. That could sway some Republicans against it, especially in the House, although it\u2019s unclear which lawmakers would go so far as to oppose an entire FAA bill because of tax extenders.\n\nSens. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) and Mike Lee (R-Utah) are two potential allies in the fight against the bill, Harbin said. A staffer for Lee said he can\u2019t comment on the senator\u2019s stance on the bill until he actually sees what the tax credits are. A staffer for Flake said via email, \u201cIt\u2019s definitely a concern.\u201d\n\nThe total cost of the energy package adds up to $1.4 billion, compared to $26 billion for last year\u2019s wind and solar credits, Harbin said. AFP didn\u2019t vocally oppose last year\u2019s package because it also included an end to the ban on crude oil exports. But now it\u2019s different. Plus, the group doesn\u2019t like the rest of this FAA bill anyway, Harbin said.\n\nThe tax credits in question, regardless of the details, already are a much smaller ask from Democrats than the wind and solar tax credits that passed last year. According to Beaulieu, in addition to being relatively cheap, these tax credits arguably need a boost to gain some market share because they are less established in the energy industry.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/icons/browserconfig.xml", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "The fate of a bipartisan bill reauthorizing the FAA lies in the hands of lawmakers crafting an unrelated provision to extend tax credits for clean energy.", "og": {"site_name": "Morning Consult", "description": "The fate of a bipartisan bill reauthorizing the FAA lies in the hands of lawmakers crafting an unrelated provision to extend tax credits for clean energy.", "title": "FAA Bill Hinges on Clean Energy", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 1216, "identifier": "https://morningconsult.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Subway-20.jpg", "height": 1080}, "updated_time": "2016-04-07T17:24:39-04:00", "url": "https://morningconsult.com/2016/04/07/clean-energy-variable-faa-bills-path-forward/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The fate of a bipartisan bill reauthorizing the FAA lies in the hands of lawmakers crafting an unrelated provision to extend tax credits for clean energy.", "creator": "@morningconsult", "image": "https://morningconsult.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Subway-20.jpg", "title": "FAA Bill Hinges on Clean Energy", "site": "@morningconsult", "card": "summary"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#2b5797", "robots": "noodp", "msapplication-TileImage": "/icons/mstile-144x144.png", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Morning-Consult-183517831660100/", "section": "Congress", "published_time": "2016-04-07T17:24:13-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-07T17:24:39-04:00"}, "theme-color": "#ffffff"}, "article_summary": "All those factors depend on the answer to one other question: What exact language is going into the provision on clean energy tax credits?\nThe unanswered questions about the FAA bill generally are: When exactly will the Senate vote to pass it?\nDemocrats have already signaled their support for the underlying FAA bill by voting to allow debate on the measure.\nThe FAA bill\u2019s tax title is still under negotiation and it\u2019s not clear exactly which clean energy sources will be included, Thune said.\nNow that the discussion of green energy tax credits has begun, other groups, including carbon-capture advocates, have asked lawmakers for consideration."}
