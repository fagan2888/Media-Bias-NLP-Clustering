Christmas Eve is one of the busier holiday travel days as millions across the nation are trying to reach destinations in time for celebrations.

There are nearly 100 million travelers on the roads or in the skies this holiday season in the U-S. Air travel is expected to be up over last year by one percent. Christmas Eve is certainly one of the busier travel days of the holiday season. That is evident at Wichita's Mid-Continent Airport Christmas Eve as fliers are trying to get to destinations in time for family celebrations.

Diane Mannion, of Dallas, was waiting to catch a flight from Wichita to London after visiting relatives here. She describes the airport crowds as, "Well it's pretty crazy. But you've got to do what you've got to do. We want to go see our family." Her daughter Courtney says, "Yea, it's crazy. There's lots of people. And it's a little slow over there. BUT? But we get to fly and see other families. So that's nice."

A traveler from Clay Center at Mid-Continent has a last name perfect for the season. Nicole Noel says, "So far it's been good. Driving here wasn't too bad."

Ashton Lofgreen caught an early morning flight from Chicago's O'Hare Airport to Wichita. She says, "You know it wasn't as bad as I expected it to be this morning. But it was my first time flying out on Christmas Eve. I expected it to be bad but it wasn't all that bad. I think I got out just in time. A snow storm coming in sounded like."

No snow or other weather factors to delay arrivals and departures in Wichita made for most flights to be on time, which is what travelers like to experience at Christmas or any other time.
