The man was still hospitalized.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t immediately clear if the pot cake directly led to the man\u2019s comatose state, or if he had ingested other substances or had underlying medical problems.\n\nAn official at Puerta de Hierro de Majadahonda hospital confirmed the man went into a comatose state, but declined to reveal further details, citing privacy issues. The hospital official spoke on condition of anonymity because she wasn\u2019t authorized to be identified by name.\n\nA total of 11 people were affected by eating the cake, Chivite said. Ten of them were hospitalized, the hospital official said. Chivite said they were treated for irregular heartbeat.\n\nJose Dominguez de Posada, dean of Madrid\u2019s Alfonso X University, said the students were all male and aged between 18 and 22 and the most affected was studying veterinary sciences. Dominguez de Posada said the university campus houses about 12,000 students.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Spanish man in a coma, 10 hospitalized after eating pot cake", "title": "Spanish man in a coma, 10 hospitalized after eating pot cake", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/02/16/spanish-man-in-a-coma-10-hospitalized-after-eating-pot-cake/", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140216__p_d4c2752d-17d3-44e8-8f4f-352e20d65fdblsoriginalph.jpg", "height": 413}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140216__p_d4c2752d-17d3-44e8-8f4f-352e20d65fdblsoriginalph.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-02-16T15:26:47+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T13:55:55+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "A total of 11 people were affected by eating the cake, Chivite said.\nThe comatose man wasn\u2019t responding to stimulus when admitted to a Madrid hospital, but he later recovered, city emergency services spokesman Javier Chivite said.\nTen of them were hospitalized, the hospital official said.\nThe hospital official spoke on condition of anonymity because she wasn\u2019t authorized to be identified by name.\nIt wasn\u2019t immediately clear if the pot cake directly led to the man\u2019s comatose state, or if he had ingested other substances or had underlying medical problems."}
