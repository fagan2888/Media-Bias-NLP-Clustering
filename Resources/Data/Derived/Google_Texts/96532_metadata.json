It is a testament to the players, researchers and advocates who have worked to expose the true human costs of a sport so many love. Though not perfect, it is fair.\"\n\nThe next step for the challengers would be to take their appeal to a larger panel of judges at the Third Circuit or to seek a Supreme Court hearing. However, legal experts say both options stand little chance because the appeals court ruled overwhelmingly in favor of the settlement, The Times reported.\n\n-----\n\nPancreas Cell Transplants Reduce Type 1 Diabetes Patients' Risk of Complications: Study\n\nPeople with type 1 diabetes who received transplants of insulin-producing pancreas cells had a significantly reduced risk of severe drops in blood sugar that can lead to seizures and even death, a new study says.\n\nThese islet cell transplants are allowed in other countries, but in the United States are available only as part of research. These findings may help efforts to gain U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval of this type of transplant for the small number of type 1 diabetes patients at high risk for such severely low blood sugar, the Associated Press reported.\n\nThe U.S. National Institutes of Health-funded study included 48 patients who had at least one islet cell transplant. After one year, 88 percent had not suffered severely low blood sugar and their blood sugar levels remained in near-normal ranges.\n\nAfter two years, 71 percent of patients were still doing that well, according to the study in the journal Diabetes Care.\n\nAlso after one year, 52 percent of the patients no longer required insulin shots and others used lower insulin doses, the AP reported.\n\n\"Cell-based diabetes therapy is real and works and offers tremendous potential for the right patient,\" according to study lead author Dr. Bernhard Hering, University of Minnesota. He and his colleagues say they will seek an FDA license for the therapy.\n\nAbout 1 million Americans have type 1 diabetes, in which the immune system destroys the pancreatic cells that make insulin. They depend on regular insulin shots to survive, but can still suffer complications due to fluctuating blood sugar levels.\n\n-----\n\nTeen Ordered to Undergo Chemotherapy Says New Mass Found in Lungs\n\nA Connecticut teen who was ordered by the courts to receive chemotherapy for Hodgkin lymphoma revealed on her Facebook page Saturday that a new mass has been found in her lungs.\n\nCassandra Callender, 18, was in remission after five months of chemotherapy she underwent when she was 17. She had fought against having the treatment for her cancer, saying she did not want to poison her body, the Associated Press reported.\n\nAt the time, she and her mother said they wanted to investigate more natural alternative treatments.\n\nCallender is now legally old enough to make her own treatment decisions and said in a text message to the AP that she is \"moving forward with alternative treatments.\"\n\n-----\n\nLarge Health Coverage Gains for Minorities Under Affordable Care Act\n\nImmigrants, minorities and low-wage workers had the most significant gains in health insurance coverage under the Affordable Care Act during its first full year, according to a New York Times analysis.\n\nThe largest rise in coverage rates was among immigrants of all backgrounds, including more than a million legal residents who are not citizens.\n\nThe analysis also found that Hispanics accounted for nearly one-third of adults who gained coverage, even though Hispanics account for just 17 percent of the overall U.S. population, The Times reported.\n\nOther minority groups also had large gains, along with low-wage workers such as cashiers, hairdressers, waiters, cooks and dishwashers.\n\nBy the end of the Affordable Care Act's first full year, 2014, the number of low-income people who were newly-insured was so large that it stopped the decades-long widening gap in coverage between poor and better-off Americans, The Times reported.\n\nHowever, the law has a long way to go before achieving the objective of universal coverage, partly due to the fact that 19 states have refused to expand their Medicaid programs for the poor.\n\n\n\n\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2016 HealthDay.
