The center is a certified application counselor organization, meaning it can assist people in enrolling into the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act -- what is commonly known as Obamacare.\n\nToday, the center held a health insurance enrollment open house, inviting people to come in and talk with its counselors and start the application process. About 50 people came through Tuesday morning. Quality of Life also held a similar session in Anniston.\n\n\n\nBarnes, 57, has some special circumstances which made it harder to determine just what he might be eligible for. A songwriter, Barnes had been living off royalties for several songs he wrote that were recorded by Brian McKnight. However, those royalties are currently being used by the IRS and a bank to pay debts and taxes, he said. He lives with his father and has virtually no income and no health insurance. His question -- what do I qualify for?\n\n\"I didn't have a clue when I got up this morning,\" Barnes said. \"That's why I was rushing to get over here. I feel like this has really helped.\"\n\n\n\nDennis Wright, a certified counselor with Quality of Life, said Barnes probably needs to check with the IRS before proceeding. But since the deadline for open enrollment continues until March 31, 2014, he has time to gather his information.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Affordable Care Act", "title": "No insurance and special circumstances?
