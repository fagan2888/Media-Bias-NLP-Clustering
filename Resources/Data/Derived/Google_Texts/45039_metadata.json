But it\u2019s happening and reforms are needed in order to stop it.\n\nThere\u2019s something disturbing about seeing someone buy groceries with an EBT card only to load them into the back of their Cadillac or Lexus, but the feds in Washington don\u2019t seem to care. They\u2019re all too happy to let states side-step the asset tests, allowing millionaire lottery winners and people with vacation homes spend your tax dollars on their groceries, rather than preserving our safety nets for the truly needy.\n\nIn fact, the Obama Administration has actively encouraged states to use backdoors to sign up people onto the welfare rolls without verifying their assets.\n\nFederal law limits the value of assets non-disabled food stamp recipients under 60 at $2,250. The law does exclude some types of property from being counted, and then states are also able to determine other exemptions from the asset tests for home values and vehicles, so the asset limits vary around the country. But as food stamp enrollment and spending has exploded, even in the face of a recovering economy, so has the use of loopholes by states.\n\nThe use of one particular loophole, Broad-Based Categorical Eligibility, has skyrocketed from just 7 states using it in 2001, rising to 13 by 2007. As of April of this year, 42 states were using this loophole to skirt asset tests. While some of these states retain some form of asset testing when they use BBCE, their asset limits are higher than federal law.\n\nThis policy enables people with lots of expensive toys like boats, vacation homes, and RV\u2019s to get Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits, or food stamps. The problem is those benefits are intended for the disabled, elderly, the unemployed poor, and our other vulnerable neighbors.\n\nBecause spending on food stamps and other welfare programs has gotten out of hand, a number of states have started looking at ways to protect their limited resources for those in true need. There\u2019s no reason our tax dollars set aside to protect someone\u2019s disabled grandmother should also be going to the 30-year-old with two jet skis.\n\nA wave of states have finally come to their senses and started enforcing asset tests on their welfare recipients. The Maine Department of Health and Human Services just announced a policy change that \u201cwill impose a $5,000 asset test to households without children\u201d that receive the state\u2019s food stamps through the SNAP program.\n\nUnder the rule, those applying or re-applying for SNAP benefits will be required to disclose certain assets. If those assets exceed $5,000 in value, the applicant will be ineligible for benefits.\n\nThe rule only applies to able-bodied childless adults receiving the benefits and does not include \u201cequity in a home or a household\u2019s primary vehicle.\u201d The state does however consider \u201cthe balance of bank accounts, snowmobiles, boats, motorcycles, jet skis, all-terrain vehicles, recreational vehicles, campers, and other valuable assets.\u201d\n\nUp until this point, Maine like many other states, allowed food stamp recipients to keep their boats and expensive toys while taking money meant to help those really in crisis. While this move doesn\u2019t quite bring Maine in line with federal asset limits, it\u2019s definitely a step in the right direction. There\u2019s just no reason to use the money from hard-working people to pay the bills of someone who has tens of thousands of dollars in the bank.\n\n\u201cMost Mainers would agree that before someone receives taxpayer-funded welfare benefits, they should sell non-essential assets and use their savings,\u201d said Maine Gov. Paul LePage. \u201cHard-working Mainers should not come home to see snowmobiles, four wheelers or jet skis in the yards of those who are getting welfare. Welfare is a last resort, not a way of life.\u201d\n\nAsset tests are an important means of keeping those people off welfare programs who do not truly need the help. Michigan, which had stricken its asset test, restored it recently after discovering several high-profile cases of lottery winners who were still collecting food stamps. In fact, in 2013, after restoring the asset test, the state identified more than 7,000 lottery winners who were receiving welfare benefits at the time of their jackpots, including individuals whose winnings were in the millions of dollars. Under the old policy, they would not have been removed from the program.\n\nIt is estimated that four million people receiving food stamps have assets higher than the federal limits. Nationally, about 21% of the households on food stamps with assets higher than the federal limits are able-bodied childless adult households. This is the same population that is being added to Medicaid rolls as part of ObamaCare. The same population that is robbing resources from those who need it most.\n\nAs DHHS Commissioner Mary Mayhew said,\n\n\u201cWhen people see that some are using welfare as a first line of defense to keep their boats and motorcycles, rather than using welfare as a safety net, it hurts the public perception of the program.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s time to look to the states for leadership to protect our public safety nets. Our governors and our state legislatures should be stepping up and putting an end to this problem, even in the face of a lax attitude from Washington. It\u2019s time for our states to be better than what Washington expects of them.\n\n_____\n\nKristina Ribali is the Senior Coalitions Director for The Foundation for Government Accountability.
