Noemie Emery questions the legitimacy of Obamacare in the public mind based on the procedural chicanery through which it became law in the face of the opposition it faced. Her article is “A slight case of bastardy.” It elaborates on points made elsewhere by others in a useful and thought-provoking way.

Emery does not mention any of the foundational lies of Obamacare that have been central to this series, but I think they bear on her point as well. These are certainly among the basic lies that were repeated over and over by Obama and the Democrats leading up to passage of the law:

1. If you like your plan, you can keep your plan. 2. If you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor. 3. Families will on average save $2500 annually. 4. Obamacare won’t add a dime to the deficit.

The list is not exhaustive, but it seems to me to hit the highlights. Lies all, central to the passage of the law, and colossal in their falsity. How can a law passed on the back of such lies ever be legitimate?
