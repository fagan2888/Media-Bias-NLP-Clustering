Pink wrote in his classic book, Spiritual Discipline:\n\nDivine assistance is imperative if we are to meet the Divine requirements. We need Divine mercy to pardon and cleanse, power to subdue our raging lusts, quickening to animate our feeble graces, light on our path that we may avoid the snares of Satan, wisdom from above for the solving of our varied problems. Only God Himself can relieve our distresses and supply all our need. His assistance, then, is to be sought: sought prayerfully, believingly, diligently and expectantly; and if it be thus sought, it will not be sought in vain.\n\nIt is amazing how often we approach spiritual discipline as though we can accomplish it on our own power. No we need to approach spiritual growth on bended knee asking for God\u2019s assistance through His Holy Spirit. Sanctification does not come through our own efforts, but by the Holy Spirit\u2019s work in our lives.\n\nThis is Shane Vander Hart with your Caffeinated Thought of the Day.\n\nRemember you can listen to Caffeinated Thoughts Radio on air at 8:00a and 6:00p on Saturdays on The Truth Network 99.3 FM if you live in the Des Moines/Ames Metro area. You can also listen online live here. Also we are on iTunes!", "article_metadata": {"shareaholic": {"site_name": "Caffeinated Thoughts", "language": "en-US", "url": "https://caffeinatedthoughts.com/2014/12/caffeinated-thought-day-spiritual-discipline/", "article_author_name": "Shane Vander Hart", "image": "https://caffeinatedthoughts.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/weight-training-1024x686.jpg", "site_id": "965f58835b5900850067f65116487024", "article_published_time": "2014-12-26T07:00:30+00:00", "shareable_page": "true", "article_modified_time": "2016-05-26T05:30:14+00:00", "keywords": "a.w. pink, divine assistance, holy spirit, sanctification, spiritual discipline, caffeinated thoughts radio, faith & theology", "wp_version": "7.7.1.0"}, "description": "Shane Vander Hart: It is amazing how often we approach spiritual discipline as though we can accomplish it on our own power.
