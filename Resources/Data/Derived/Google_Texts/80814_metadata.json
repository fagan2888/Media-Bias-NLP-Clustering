Today (Nov. 19), the FDA announced that it has approved the fish for consumption in the US, although they can only be raised in \u201cland-based, contained hatchery tanks in two specific facilities in Canada and Panama.\u201d The fish cannot be bred or farmed in the US, and if they are raised in locations outside of those two facilities, they cannot be sold in the US.\n\n(AquaBounty)\n\n\u201cThe FDA has thoroughly analyzed and evaluated the data and information submitted by AquaBounty Technologies regarding AquAdvantage Salmon and determined that they have met the regulatory requirements for approval, including that food from the fish is safe to eat,\u201d said Bernadette Dunham, director of the FDA\u2019s Center for Veterinary Medicine, in the announcement.\n\nAlthough the FDA is also providing guidance documents to help food producers label any products made with this genetically engineered salmon, the guidelines are voluntary. It is also accepting public comments beginning on November 23 about labeling requirements. The announcement did not include information about when the fish could become available to consumers in the US.\n\nAquAdvantage Salmon has faced serious opposition fromenvironmentalists who worry that the farmed fish will escape their enclosed farms and outcompete natural salmon in the wild, thus potentially driving the already dwindling species out of existence. The FDA addresses these concerns, saying that the mega-salmon will not have a significant environmental impact \u201cbecause of the multiple and redundant measures being taken to contain the fish and prevent their escape and establishment in the environment.\u201d\n\nEnvironmental groups, however, were not persuaded. \u201cFood & Water Watch will be examining all options to stop this controversial and unnecessary GMO fish from reaching the marketplace. We urge President Obama to overturn FDA\u2019s approval and stop GMO salmon from reaching consumers\u2019 dinner plates,\u201d the organization said in a statement this morning.\n\n(Image via Elena Shashkina/Shutterstock.com)", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Deena Shanker", "description": "The AquAdvantage Salmon can reach the same size as conventional salmon in half the time.", "og": {"site_name": "Government Executive", "description": "The AquAdvantage Salmon can reach the same size as conventional salmon in half the time.", "title": "The FDA Approved the First Genetically Modified Animal For Human Food Consumption", "url": "http://www.govexec.com/management/2015/11/fda-approved-first-genetically-modified-animal-human-food-consumption/123879/", "image": "http://cdn.govexec.com/media/img/upload/2015/11/19/111915salmon.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://cdn.govexec.com/media/img/upload/2015/11/19/111915salmon/open-graph.jpg", "description": "The AquAdvantage Salmon can reach the same size as conventional salmon in half the time.", "site": "@govexec", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "The FDA Approved the First Genetically Modified Animal For Human Food Consumption"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-11-20T02:00:00Z", "sailthru.images.full": "http://cdn.govexec.com/media/img/upload/2015/11/19/111915salmon.jpg", "sailthru.title": "The FDA Approved the First Genetically Modified Animal For Human Food Consumption", "keywords": "fda, food labeling, salmon", "fb": {"admins": 578600878}, "sailthru.images.thumb": "http://cdn.govexec.com/media/img/upload/2015/11/19/111915salmon/sailthru-thumbnail.jpg", "sailthru.tags": "fda,channel-management,type-story,length-short,site-govexec", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/GovernmentExecutive"}, "sailthru.description": "The AquAdvantage Salmon can reach the same size as conventional salmon in half the time."}, "article_summary": "The US Food and Drug Administration made a landmark announcement this morning: It has approved the first genetically modified animal for human consumption in the US.\nWe urge President Obama to overturn FDA\u2019s approval and stop GMO salmon from reaching consumers\u2019 dinner plates,\u201d the organization said in a statement this morning.\n\u201cFood & Water Watch will be examining all options to stop this controversial and unnecessary GMO fish from reaching the marketplace.\nAlthough the FDA is also providing guidance documents to help food producers label any products made with this genetically engineered salmon, the guidelines are voluntary.\nThe initial application for AquAdvantage Salmon, which can reach the same size as conventional salmon in half the time, was filed in 1996."}
