A vote this year is highly unlikely, with the Senate set to recess this week until early 2014.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Harry Reid has indicated he is opposed to bringing such a bill to the floor in January, saying he agreed with the Obama administration's call to give the delicate negotiations a chance to work.\n\nShould the landmark interim deal collapse, the proposed sanctions would require Iran to reduce its oil production and would apply new penalties to the Islamic republic's engineering, mining and construction industries.\n\nThe new legislation was introduced as negotiations were set to resume Thursday in Geneva between Iran and world powers in the so-called P5+1: the United States, China, Britain, France, Russia and Germany.\n\nEdited by Bonnie Malkin", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "GSAGenre": "uspolitics", "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02750/Rouhani_2750991k.jpg"}, "site": "@Telegraph", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "keywords": "iran, us, sanctions, bill, veto, obama, , US Politics,World News,News", "DCSext.cmsSect": "News;World_News;Iran;North_America;USA;Wire_copy;US_Politics", "DCSext.Channel": "news", "DCSext.MLC": "/news/worldnews/us-politics", "DCSext.Content_Type": "Story", "news_keywords": "iran, us, sanctions, bill, veto, obama,", "WT.cg_n": "news", "title": "White House says it would veto Iran sanctions bill", "section-id": 6227, "GSACategory": "worldnews", "tmgads.pagetype": "Story", "DCSext.akamigeo": "US", "tmgads.section": "news-worldnews-us_politics", "GSAMLC": "news/worldnews/uspolitics", "GSAArticleType": "Story", "DCSext.pd": 1, "WT.cg_s": "worldnews", "description": "Twenty-six US senators introduced new Iran sanctions legislation, despite an intense White House lobbying campaign", "tmgads.channel": "news", "article-id": 10529409, "DCSext.Category": "worldnews", "DCSext.Level": 4, "DC.date.issued": "2013-12-19", "robots": "noarchive,noodp", "GSASectionUniqueName": "news-world_news-us_politics", "last-modified": "2013-12-19", "fb": {"admins": "686953094,531239902,100002344351237", "app_id": 120118784736295}, "article": {"publisher": 143666524748, "contenttype": "story", "section": "World", "wordcount": 397, "embedcount": 0, "tag": "US Politics", "subsection": "US Politics", "videocount": 0, "internallinkcount": 7, "imagecount": 1, "externallinkcount": 0}, "DCSext.articleId": 10529409, "tmgads.articleid": 10529409, "tmgads.level": 4, "tmgads.geo": "US", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"White House says it would veto Iran sanctions bill   \",\"link\": \"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/us-politics/10529409/White-House-says-it-would-veto-Iran-sanctions-bill.html\",\"image_url\": \"http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02750/Rouhani_2750991k.jpg\",\"type\": \"post\",\"post_id\": \"10529409\", \"pub_date\": \"2013-12-19T22:40:35Z\",\"section\": \"World\",\"authors\": [\"TMG\"],\"tags\": [\"Story\",\"News\",\"World News\",\"Iran\",\"North America\",\"USA\",\"Wire copy\",\"US Politics\"]}", "GSAChannel": "news", "author": "AFP", "GSAChannelName": "News", "og": {"site_name": "Telegraph.co.uk", "description": "Twenty-six US senators introduced new Iran sanctions legislation, despite an intense White House lobbying campaign", "title": "White House says it would veto Iran sanctions bill", "url": "http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/us-politics/10529409/White-House-says-it-would-veto-Iran-sanctions-bill.html", "image": "http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02750/Rouhani_2750991k.jpg", "type": "article"}, "DCSext.Genre": "us-politics", "DCSext.cf": 1, "tmgads.zone": "news.worldnews.us-politics", "DCSext.author": "AFP", "DCSext.articleFirstPublished": "2013-12-19 22:40"}, "article_summary": "Twenty-six US senators introduced new Iran sanctions legislation earlier Thursday, despite an intense White House lobbying campaign.\nThe White House has warned Congress that President Barack Obama would veto a bill threatening new sanctions on Iran , saying it could derail diplomacy aimed at sealing a comprehensive nuclear deal.\n\"If it were to pass, the president will veto it,\" White House spokesman Jay Carney said.\nBut the White House appears alarmed that the move could undermine the Iranian negotiating team or offer the Islamic Republic an excuse to walk away from the negotiations.\n\"Current sanctions brought Iran to the negotiating table and a credible threat of future sanctions will require Iran to cooperate and act in good faith,\" said Menendez in a statement introducing the legislation."}
