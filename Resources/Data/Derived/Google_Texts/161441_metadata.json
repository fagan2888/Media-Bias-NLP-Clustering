The bill is up for a vote on Friday.\n\nRep. Robert Aderholt (R-Ala.), the sponsor of the WIC funding measure, blamed Democrats for blocking the WIC funds. \"The House has passed a funding bill previously to keep the WIC program operational, and the Senate said no,\" he told The Huffington Post, referring to the House spending bill that would have defunded the Affordable Care Act as a price for keeping the government open. \"We'll pass a [WIC] funding bill today, and the Senate should take yes for an answer.\"\n\nHouse Republicans have also introduced a separate resolution to reopen the World War II memorial in Washington, D.C., but veterans told HuffPost that they oppose that measure as well. Democratic leaders and President Obama have condemned the piecemeal approach, and have said they will not settle for anything but a comprehensive, clean spending bill that funds the entire government.\n\n\"These piecemeal efforts are not serious, and they are no way to run a government,\" White House spokeswoman Amy Brundage said. \"If House Republicans are legitimately concerned about the impacts of a shutdown -- which extend across government from our small businesses to women, children and seniors -- they should do their job and pass a clean CR to reopen the government. The president and the Senate have been clear that they won\u2019t accept this kind of game-playing, and if these bills were to come to the president\u2019s desk he would veto them.\"\n\n\n\nAlso on HuffPost: 2013 Government Shutdown 2013 Government Shutdown\n\n1 of 242 John Boehner Speaker of the House Rep.
