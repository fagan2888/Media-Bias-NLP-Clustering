The 61 delegates Kentucky had on the line and Oregon\u2019s 74 will be divided proportionally among the two candidates based on results in those states \u2014 and that\u2019s the bad news for Sanders. He needs to win by overwhelming margins the rest of the way to stand a chance at catching Clinton.\n\nHere are five takeaways from Tuesday\u2019s primaries:\n\nClinton finally wins a state\n\nWith an all-but-insurmountable delegate lead, Clinton didn\u2019t need to win Kentucky.\n\nBut she\u2019s surely glad she did, however narrow her victory.\n\nHer triumph \u2014 particularly in a largely white, working-class state \u2014 will prevent Clinton from limping into California\u2019s June 7 primary on a string of May losses.\n\nIn Kentucky, Clinton learned the lessons of Indiana, where Sanders outspent her on television, nearly $2 million to $0. Unlike Indiana, where she held just three events, Clinton devoted much more time to campaigning in Kentucky.\n\nShe held 11 campaign stops over three visits, spread over a two-week span. And she played up the economic credentials of her husband, Bill Clinton \u2014 the last Democrat to carry Kentucky in a general election, in 1992 and 1996.\n\nAlso helping Clinton with the registered Democrats who voted in Kentucky\u2019s primary: Her carefully cultivated status as President Barack Obama\u2019s natural heir.\n\nThe party\u2019s gains have been hard-won in the state. Former Gov. Steve Beshear fought to set up a state program for Obamacare that became a national model \u2014 only to watch Republican Gov. Matt Bevin strive to dismantle it. The changes of the Obama era are still not secured in Kentucky \u2014 so Sanders\u2019 big-picture liberalism feels much less feasible there.\n\nBut Sanders wins Oregon\n\nSanders\u2019 win in Oregon wasn\u2019t nearly enough to put him in a realistic place to overtake Clinton in the number of pledged delegates \u2014 but it did mean he\u2019ll close Tuesday\u2019s contests with more delegates that day than Clinton, and it\u2019ll keep his campaign chugging along.\n\nThe largely white, liberal, homogenous state was the perfect place for a Sanders victory. He was so confident he\u2019d win Oregon that he spent the days leading up to the primary campaigning in California and Puerto Rico.\n\n\u201cLet me be as clear as I can be: I agree with you. We are in \u2019til the last ballot is cast,\u201d Sanders told supporters in Carson, California, late Tuesday night.\n\nSanders turned his election-night speech into a rant against media and political establishment figures who are increasingly calling on him to exit the race. He touted California\u2019s positioning as a delegate gold mine.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t tell Secretary Clinton, she might get nervous: I think we\u2019re going to win here in California,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cAnd as all of you know, California has 475 pledged delegates.\u201d\n\nWhat that means: Sanders has staked everything on staying in the race until the last votes are counted.\n\nThis race will stay messy\n\nSuddenly, the party that expected to sit back and watch Republicans duke it out at their convention in Cleveland is fretting that chaos could come to Philadelphia.\n\nThe turmoil at Nevada\u2019s Democratic convention over the weekend spilled into Tuesday night. After reports that the state chairwoman faced threats from Sanders supporters, his campaign manager Jeff Weaver said on CNN that \u201cwe condemn that, absolutely, categorically.\u201d\n\nWeaver promised peace at the Democratic National Convention.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s not going to be any violence in Philadelphia \u2026 I guarantee you that. We hope for a fair and orderly convention,\u201d he said.\n\nBut Sanders\u2019 supporters might not be easy to mollify.\n\nThe big question is whether what happened in Nevada will occur again.\n\n\u201cWhat happened at that convention was unacceptable,\u201d said Democratic National Committee Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz, laying the blame heavily on Sanders\u2019 supporters by saying they should \u201caddress process concerns in a civil way\u201d in a Tuesday night interview with CNN\u2019s Wolf Blitzer.\n\n\u201cThe bottom line is, we have the same rules in place that elected Barack Obama, and these rules were adopted by state parties around the country in 2014,\u201d she said. \u201cThey were followed, and even if the Sanders supporters were frustrated, there is never a place for violence and intimidation to be resorted to.\u201d\n\nBut is Kentucky actually over?\n\nMore people voted for Martin O\u2019Malley in Kentucky than the margin between Clinton and Sanders at the end of the night, a margin close enough to make a recount possible.\n\nWith all precincts reporting, Clinton held a 1,923 vote lead over Bernie Sanders, the office of Kentucky Secretary of State Alison Lundergan Grimes told CNN.\n\nThe state\u2019s results don\u2019t become official until May 31. Sanders has a week to request in writing a re-canvass that would involve Kentucky officials manually checking voting machines to make sure that the totals are correct.\n\nSanders spokesman Michael Briggs told CNN that the campaign will \u201ctake a close look at the numbers\u201d and decide Wednesday whether to challenge Kentucky\u2019s results.\n\nWhat may bother Sanders\u2019 supporters: Lundergan Grimes went on CNN before all the votes were in and called Clinton the \u201cunofficial\u201d winner of Kentucky.\n\nLundergan Grimes is a big Clinton supporter. Her father, an influential Democrat in Kentucky, is a long-time Clinton ally, too. Would she have made the same \u201cunofficial\u201d declaration for Sanders?\n\nYes, the Republican race really is over\n\nWhile the Democratic race rolls on, the GOP contest \u2014 the one with Donald Trump, 17 candidates and personal insults that everyone was exercised about \u2014 is officially over, done and boring.\n\nThe best political experts could do was muse about mail-in ballots in Oregon.\n\nIt\u2019s a vote-by-mail state, and ballots were sent out three weeks before the primary. Trump had just won on the East Coast, and Ted Cruz and John Kasich were just about to strike a deal that would\u2019ve theoretically given Kasich a clean one-on-one shot at Trump in Oregon.\n\nOf course, both Cruz and Kasich dropped out after the Indiana primary. But Oregon voters still had the option of going with one as a protest vote.\n\nThat didn\u2019t happen. With more than half the vote in, Trump was on course to take two-thirds of the state\u2019s GOP support.\n\nOutside the election-night spotlight, Trump\u2019s campaign did everything possible to stay in the news Tuesday night.\n\nFirst, he filed a personal financial disclosure claiming he earned at least $560 million last year. And he taunted Clinton via Twitter.\n\nThen, Trump\u2019s campaign and the Republican National Committee announced a joint fundraising agreement to form two committees that will allow individual donors to give up to $449,400 and will help state parties.\n\nWhy that move matters: It\u2019s the latest demonstration of the reality that this is Trump\u2019s Republican Party now.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Bernie Sanders won more delegates than Hillary Clinton on Tuesday night -- but not enough to slow Clinton's march to the Democratic presidential nomination.
