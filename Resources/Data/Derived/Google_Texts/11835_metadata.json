And it's all Obama's fault.\n\n\u201cIraqi troops battled to dislodge an al Qaeda splinter group from the city of Tikrit on Monday,\u201d reports the Hindustan Times, \u201cafter its leader was declared caliph of a new Islamic state in lands seized this month across a swathe of Iraq and Syria.\u201d\n\nThe caliphate claims worldwide authority over all Muslims, and poses a challenge not to U.S. control in the region\u2014because we have none-- but to Iran\u2019s control of Iraq.\n\nSo no matter who wins, we are pretty much doomed to an outcome that will cost America hugely in the future. Currently, Russia is sending military aid to Iraq to bolster the current government. In response to the crisis, President Obama has sent Iraq an autographed copy of his book, a $25 gift card from Starbucks, and outtakes of planted questions from a recent press conference on Iraq.\n\nIt\u2019s hilarious. I\u2019ve seen it.\n\nWhat\u2019s not hilarious is that they lost China, they lost Iraq\u2026and Iran, and Libya, and Afghanistan and Pakistan AND they tried mightily to lose Egypt. Fortunately, the U.S. trained officers of the Egyptian Army have more sense than they do.\n\nWho are the \u201cthey\u201d in this scenario?\n\nWell despite what our own prophet of doom, Dr. Ron Paul, says about Iraq-- he blames it squarely on G.W. Bush-- this is all president Obama\u2019s fault.\n\nHe\u2019s the \u201cthem\u201d here.\n\nBecause here\u2019s the thing: Let\u2019s pretend for a moment that Obama actually cared about foreign policy and national security.\n\nI know that\u2019s hard to do, but please try.\n\nObama can\u2019t fight wars and then expand welfare; he can\u2019t fight wars and expand social security disability; he can\u2019t fight wars and have Obamacare too.\n\nIn short, Obama and his leftist friends have decided that the only common defense that they care about is defending the government\u2019s reach to every corner of American society.\n\nSo national security can be damned.\n\nWe just can\u2019t afford to make the country secure right now.\n\nThere are too many free telephones, birth control, and bailouts for Obama cronies to give away with your money to afford a luxury item like a free and secure country.\n\n\u201cI knew from the start that if I left the woman I love--the Great Society,\u201d said president Lyndon Johnson about America\u2019s involvement in Vietnam, \u201cin order to fight that bitch of a war, then I would lose everything. All my programs. All my hopes. All my dreams.\u201d\n\nObama and his friends will not make the same mistake that Johnson, the old liar, claims he made.\n\nThe Obama folks: many of them are, after all, the folks who toppled LBJ in 1968, the Democrat who created the Great Society.\n\nLBJ once said Gerald Ford couldn\u2019t walk and chew bubble gum at the same time.\n\nActually Ford was a gifted athlete.\n\nIt\u2019s LBJ and his contemporary liberal friends who can\u2019t do two things at once.\n\nAnd this is part of the reason why the Obama administration is so obsessed with spying by the NSA.\n\nBeing the amateurs that they are, they have no idea what the real job of the intelligence community is.\n\nThey think that spying is a cheap substitute for national defense, which it is not.\n\nThat type of policy only leads to the gutting of our national liberty and the gutting of our national defense, all in the name of defending our liberty to have free phones, free birth control, and free money.\n\nThe loss of the Middle East is a loss that even LBJ would be ashamed of.\n\n\u201cTell me something Lieutenant,\u201d said Hippy in author Karl Marlantes\u2019 epic depiction of the Vietnam War, Matterhorn, written from the viewpoint of a Marine infantry company. \u201cJust tell me where the gold is. Yes, the gold, the f---ing gold, or the oil, or uranium. Something. Jesus Christ, something out there for us to be here.\u201d\n\nWell, the gold is now at home. The Federal Reserve has it, as Dr. Ron Paul would no doubt remind us.\n\nBut the oil? That\u2019s in the Middle East.\n\nAnd even an old, grizzled Marine knows deep down that that is something worth fighting for.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "They Lost China, and Iran, and Iraq, and Libya, and Afghanistan and Pakistan and... - John Ransom - Personal Finance, Financial Advice, Money, Business News, Real Estate, Mortgages, Investments, Stocks, Ransom Notes Radio, John Ransom", "og": {"site_name": "finance.townhall.com", "description": "A victory beyond the wildest dreams of Osama bin Laden is within reach of fighters from ISIL.
