NEW YORK (AP) — Some 330 dogs are set to run — and spring, balance, whirl and weave — the agility course at the Westminster Kennel Club dog show.

Saturday’s contest is a recent and fast-expanding addition to the nation’s premiere canine event. The roster of competitors is up more than 45 percent from Westminster’s first agility contest last year.

The competitors span 74 dog breeds and varieties, and 15 hopefuls are mixed-breeds. The agility competition allowed them to return last year to Westminster for the first time since the show’s early years in the late 1800s.

The sport entails dogs navigating an obstacle course of jumps, tunnels, ramps and other items as quickly and cleanly as they can. Handlers use voice and body signals to guide the animals through a complex route.
