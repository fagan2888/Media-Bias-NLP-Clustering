Glenn Beck and Glenn Greenwald do not agree on much in the world today.

However, the two came together Friday to roundly denounce a potential 2016 general election between Hillary Clinton and Jeb Bush.

Appearing on Beck’s radio show, Greenwald, an investigative journalist known for breaking the Edward Snowden story, said a potential race between the two is “sickening and depressing.” He added that “horror and nightmares” consume his mind when he thinks of a Hillary Clinton presidency.

“When I say Hillary Clinton — President Hillary Clinton, what crosses your mind?” Beck asked.

“Horror and nightmares,” Greenwald said. “I think that having a Jeb Bush vs. Hillary Clinton election, as sickening and depressing as that is, will be really clarifying. Because, where is American meritocracy in this, right?”

“Here’s what I want. I want Elizabeth Warren vs. Ted Cruz,” Beck responded. “Let’s have a real debate! You couldn’t get further apart than those two. And in strange ways, their principles of the Constitution bind them together.”

“How much more interesting and healthy and enlivening would that be to have a real debate?” Greenwald asked the host.

Last month, Beck announced he was “done” with the Republican Party after they failed to stand against Obamacare and illegal immigration, adding that they were “torpedoing the Constitution.” (RELATED: ‘I’ve Made My Decision — I’m Out.’ Glenn Beck Leaves The Republican Party)

“Hillary Clinton and Jeb Bush are interchangeable,” Beck said.

“They have the same funders, the same backers,” Greenwald said. “Wall Street is just praying for Jeb Bush/Hillary Clinton.”
