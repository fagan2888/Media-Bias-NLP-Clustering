After hours standing in the dark, Zimmer saw the sun rise. Under its light, a line of Bernie Sanders supporters was illuminated.\n\nZimmer left her home in Victor, Idaho, at 5 a.m. to get a good spot at the Sanders rally on March 18. When she finally arrived a little after six, there were already 40 people in queue. By the time doors opened three hours later, that crowd had swelled to thousands. Approximately 3,200 people attended the Idaho Falls rally, with showings from Idaho\u2019s panhandle, Montana, and Jackson Hole.\n\nWhile the Teton County GOP is seemingly divided over a 21-19 vote that named Donald Trump the party\u2019s chosen one (prompting GOP county chair JuliAnne Forrest to resign last week), local Democrats are coming together in the name of Sanders.\n\nTwelve-year resident Marcus Stauffer, 38, is the front office manager at a local hotel. He was among the Jackson contingent in Idaho Falls to see Sanders. \u201cBernie seems completely different [from other candidates],\u201d he said. \u201cBy not having to answer to special interests, he can focus on doing good to improve the lives of average Americans.\u201d\n\nBoots on the ground\n\nThe Sanders campaign has relied heavily on grassroots organizers. According to statistics released by The New York Times, Hillary Clinton has enjoyed more than double the media coverage than Sanders. Trump, meanwhile, has received almost five times as much. Sanders\u2019 lack of coverage in mainstream media is so blatant it has been termed the \u201cBernie Blackout.\u201d\n\nDespite the lack of major media coverage, the Sanders movement is gaining traction in Jackson Hole. According to Wyoming voter registration data from the Secretary of State\u2019s website, from January to March of this year, 42 people registered as Democrats in Teton County, nearly double the number of Republican registrations in the same timeframe.\n\nDr. Justin Vaughn is Boise State University\u2019s resident expert on political institutions, specifically the presidency. He has been following the Sanders campaign very closely. \u201cI think in some ways, the fact that there is this media blackout has reinforced the enthusiasm the younger voters have for [Sanders],\u201d he said.\n\nThe Bernie campaign\u2019s Wyoming director, Shelby Iseler, says Sanders\u2019 magnetism has less to do with him and more to do with the movement itself. \u201cI noticed this when I first started supporting the senator: it\u2019s not about him,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s about a grassroots movement, a political revolution. He sends a very inclusive message. Whoever you are, you have a right to be a part of this Democratic process.\u201d\n\nDemocratic Party members in Jackson are on the front lines of this word-of-mouth campaign as the deadline to register for the Wyoming caucus nears. After March 25, residents who have not registered to vote as Democrats cannot participate in the Democratic caucus on April 9.\n\nArtist Aaron Wallis is part of the boots-on-the-ground Sanders campaign team in Jackson. As a volunteer, he is going door-to-door, calling people who have shown interest in the campaign, and spreading his passion for Sanders by word of mouth. \u201cI certainly feel that Bernie is the first candidate in at least my lifetime that has the courage to take on the banks and corps that made America unlivable for so many people,\u201d he said.\n\nLast weekend, Teton County\u2019s Sanders campaign organizers Nathaniel Greene and Curt Allain took over the community room at the Jackson Whole Grocer. Through their efforts, the grocery store has become campaign headquarters, facilitating hands-on training for volunteers and public information distribution. Their goal is to inform the public about campaign platforms, to make the caucus system more digestible, and to promote the absentee ballot process.\n\nBecause the Democratic caucus happens in early April when many folks will be out of town, the absentee ballot has become critical to the campaign.\n\nWren Fialka, a massage therapist who works in Teton Village, has been carrying absentee ballots with her everywhere she goes. \u201cThis is the most important election we\u2019ve ever had,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve always been pretty active in getting people to vote because I think we have all of these rights and privileges, and we\u2019ve become pretty apathetic.\u201d\n\nGreg Epstein agreed. The head of production at Teton Gravity Research fears people are disenfranchising themselves. \u201cVoter suppression is happening enough in our country, we don\u2019t need to implement it by apathy,\u201d he said.\n\nEnsuring people have the opportunity to be heard is a key goal of Sanders advocates. The caucus system is not an easy process and Stauffer hopes to remove voting barriers through an informed electorate.\n\n\u201cI am doing my best to get the message out,\u201d he said. \u201cMostly with people at work and with friends. I think my goal is to help people understand the confusing nature of the Wyoming caucus process in order to help people be enfranchised, or to keep them from being disenfranchised based on work schedules in the seasonal industry. For a lot of people, they leave town in April, or they work, or they just can\u2019t afford to give up two-thirds of their day. If they\u2019re not aware of the absentee ballot process, they\u2019ll miss out.\u201d\n\nSocial media: the aid and the blade\n\nEpstein is actively encouraging the absentee ballot process as well. His venue of choice has been through social media. \u201cYou look at social media where Bernie Sanders is winning the war, and you have to look at the demographic that uses social media. It\u2019s the younger generation. That generation is the future of this country,\u201d he said.\n\nSanders couldn\u2019t agree more. As he pointed out Friday in Idaho Falls: \u201cWe have received more votes from people under 30 than Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump combined.\u201d\n\nAs the Sanders campaign proves, mainstream media does not dictate the newsworthiness of a candidate. Instead, social media has become the heart and soul of grassroots movements.\n\nHowever, those without high-speed Internet access are left in the dark. Epstein thinks that in areas where broadband is not as accessible, there is a very obvious trend away from the Sanders campaign. \u201cYou don\u2019t get the same access to high speed broadband in rural areas that you do in places like Jackson. There are a lot of parts of [Wyoming] that don\u2019t get it. So are they getting their information through social media? No. Are they watching Fox News? You betcha.\u201d\n\nUnsurprisingly, Fox News recently published the article \u201cDoes Sanders Really Want to Win?\u201d It questioned whether Sanders was even actually interested in becoming president. In the article, author William Whalen said that if Sanders wanted to be the future POTUS, he would need \u201cto call out Clinton in more glaring terms. Otherwise, he\u2019s gum on her shoe.\u201d\n\nMainstream media campaigns like this make it seem like Sanders does not have a chance at the nomination. However, as Vaughn pointed out, \u201cBernie has won more states than Ted Cruz, but you don\u2019t hear the media trying to get [Cruz] to drop out. There is this irony that younger Sanders enthusiasts are aware of and maybe it motivates them more.\u201d\n\nOne percent and dissenters\n\nEven with media blackouts haunting the Sanders campaign, Stauffer thinks the movement is finding good footing in Jackson partially because of the valley\u2019s economic disparities.\n\n\u201cWe are in an area where you have to see firsthand the kind of obscene amount of wealth that has been generated over the last couple decades for only a select few,\u201d he said. With so much wealth in the area, Stauffer sees tax dodging as a flagrant abuse of the political system. \u201cWe see these people every day with multimillion dollar homes in dozens of places, but they claim residency here in Wyoming just trying to avoid paying taxes somewhere else\u2014even though their tax load would probably be more than you and I make in a year.\u201d\n\nStauffer believes the Sanders\u2019 platforms that advocate single-payer healthcare and public universities are not impossible. There is plenty of money to make those things a reality, he said, but without the campaign reforms Sanders is demanding, the people with money will continue to be the only people with influence.\n\n\u201cThe only way we change America,\u201d Sanders said in Idaho Falls, \u201cis if millions of people stand up and fight back, and that is what the political revolution is about. Conservatives as well as progressives can agree that we have a rigged economy when there are so few with so much, and so many with so little.\u201d\n\nJackson is no stranger to one-percenters. Christy Walton, one of the heirs to the Walton fortune, listed her Jackson home with Jackson Hole Real Estate a few years ago for $12.5 million. In contrast, the average employee of Wal-Mart makes about $8.81 per hour, according to IBISWorld Industry Reports. Based on Wal-Mart\u2019s full-time status of 34 hours per week, it would take an average employee more than 806 years to earn enough money to afford Walton\u2019s Jackson home.\n\nSanders has made Wal-Mart itself a campaign platform. The Vermont senator sees it as the poster boy for a rigged economy. Wal-Mart, Sanders explained to the Idaho Falls crowd, does not pay its employees a living wage, leaving the middle class to pick-up the check on food stamps, Medicaid, and subsidized housing for its employees. \u201cOn behalf of the wealthiest family in America, thank you for paying their welfare,\u201d he quipped.\n\nAll pay, no product\n\nToday, many middle class folks continue to struggle to pay their health insurance premiums under the Affordable Care Act. Worse yet, even with health insurance many are still left with staggering medical bills. Now back to Molly Zimmer, 54. She can attest to this firsthand. Recently, a member of her immediate family had what doctors classified as a panic attack. Unfortunately for the Zimmer family, however, the symptoms seemed like a heart attack. After tests and a single night of observation in the hospital, the Zimmer family accrued more than $25,000 in medical expenses not covered under their current healthcare plan.\n\n\u201cThis was for a non-life-threatening procedure. No surgery, no stitches, just him in a bed with a heart monitor,\u201d Zimmer said. Even with a monthly health insurance premium of $1,000 for a family of three, Zimmer will have to pay up. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t raise the issue if I thought [healthcare affordability] only concerned me, but nearly every family I know faces a similar situation. We\u2019re not an isolated occurrence. It just seems like everyone on both sides of the hill is on the brink, thinking one major medical occurrence could cripple them.\u201d\n\nIf Sanders\u2019 healthcare reforms are passed, the senator\u2019s goal is that, \u201cmillions of people will no longer have to choose between healthcare and other necessities like food, heat and shelter.\u201d\n\nAccording to Zimmer, many people are afraid electing Sanders will cause astronomical tax hikes. But U.S. citizens are already paying into the system through taxes currently collected. The only thing that needs to change is how those tax dollars are being spent, she said. \u201cWe understand it\u2019s not \u2018free college\u2019 or \u2018free healthcare.\u2019 It\u2019s our tax dollars that are being spent, but we want a better return on our investment.\u201d\n\nShe would like to see her tax dollars used on Sanders platforms like single-payer universal healthcare and education, rather than on massive international wars and government subsidies for mega-firms like Wal-Mart.\n\nBoise State\u2019s Vaughn is not particularly enthused by the Affordable Care Act (ACA). \u201cIt\u2019s an incredibly compromised, flawed piece of legislation,\u201d he said, \u201cand either we will abandon it in favor of a single-payer system like most of the wealthy, developed world; or abandon it in favor of market-driven healthcare, similar to what we had before. Right now we have the worst possible combination of those things.\u201d Vaughn also noted that ACA forces people to buy insurance without actually being provided healthcare.\n\n\u201cPeople are just tired,\u201d Zimmer said. \u201cThey are tired of feeling like they\u2019re not getting any return on their investment. They\u2019re tired of being afraid a chisler bite will set them back $2,300 for a rabies shot. They\u2019re tired of poor education\u2014Idaho has some of the worst schools in the nation\u2014, and Sanders wants to give them a better return.\u201d\n\nStauffer thinks that voters in Jackson have a key role to play in the election cycle. \u201cIn [sparsely populated areas] like Wyoming, you have such a significant voice. Whether you\u2019re voting for Sanders or Clinton, hopefully its Sanders, this is the time to let your voice be heard.\u201d PJH\n\nComments\n\ncomments", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://planetjh.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/160323Buzz1.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 526300947519080}, "generator": "WordPress 4.4.3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Last weekend, Teton County\u2019s Sanders campaign organizers Nathaniel Greene and Curt Allain took over the community room at the Jackson Whole Grocer.\nChristy Walton, one of the heirs to the Walton fortune, listed her Jackson home with Jackson Hole Real Estate a few years ago for $12.5 million.\nArtist Aaron Wallis is part of the boots-on-the-ground Sanders campaign team in Jackson.\nEpstein thinks that in areas where broadband is not as accessible, there is a very obvious trend away from the Sanders campaign.\nHe has been following the Sanders campaign very closely."}
