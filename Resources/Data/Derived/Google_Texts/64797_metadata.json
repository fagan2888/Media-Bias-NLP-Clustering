In this version of \u201cDownfall,\u201d Adolf Hitler was informed that after his meeting with former White House employee Valarie Jarrett, he will be seeing a Jewish doctor for a prostate cancer check.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want a Jew like Feingold poking around my bum,\u201d Hitler replied in the subtitles. \u201cJust make an appointment with Dr. Steiner.\u201d\n\nHitler\u2019s aides informed him the Dr. Steiner is now out of his network, thanks to the ACA.\n\nIn the parody video, Hitler reacted incredulously and went on an anti-Obamacare rant that ended in his suicide.\n\nFriess was a major supporter of former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum (R)\u2019s unsuccessful 2012 run for the presidency. During the campaign, Friess said that if women want access to birth control, all they have to do is put an aspirin \u201cbetween the knees,\u201d like the \u201cgals\u201d did \u201cback in my day.\u201d\n\nWatch the video, embedded below:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": {"width": 800, "identifier": "http://www.rawstory.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Hitler-parody-from-Friess-screencap-800x430.png", "height": 430}, "title": "GOP megadonor uses played-out Hitler meme to make attack on Obamacare"}, "fb": {"app_id": 212555972273585}, "viewport": "width=device-width, user-scalable=yes, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=0.1, maximum-scale=10.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce92b\"", "article_summary": "In the parody video, Hitler reacted incredulously and went on an anti-Obamacare rant that ended in his suicide.\nSeven years later, Friess is perhaps using it to try and capture a youthful, edgy vibe around resistance to the ACA.\n\u201cI don\u2019t want a Jew like Feingold poking around my bum,\u201d Hitler replied in the subtitles.\nKnow Your Meme reported that the video has been used as a meme since 2006, when video gamers used substituted captions to complain about the lack of new features in the then-new iteration of Microsoft\u2019s \u201cFlight Simulator X\u201d game.\nFriess was a major supporter of former Pennsylvania Sen.
