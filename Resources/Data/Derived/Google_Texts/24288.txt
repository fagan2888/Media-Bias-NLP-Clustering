AUSTIN, Texas -- The future of ridesharing companies in Austin could be determined at an upcoming city council meeting.

Uber has implied it will pull out of the city if its drivers are required to undergo fingerprint background checks.

In October, the Austin City Council took a step toward requiring drivers for Uber, Lyft and other ridesharing companies to do so by passing a resolution.

Members are expected to vote on an ordinance that would amend the city code to add the regulations Thursday.

Taxi and limo drivers are already required to undergo fingerprint background checks and say companies such as Uber and Lyft should, too.

Meanwhile, Uber has said their name-based background checks are good enough.
