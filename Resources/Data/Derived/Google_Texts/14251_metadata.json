It's only takes 50 seconds for the Franklin Institute's chief bioscientist, Jayatri Das, to demonstrate something fundamental about your brain.\n\nShe starts with a clip that's been digitally altered to sound like jibberish. On first listen, to my ears, it was entirely meaningless. Next, Das plays the original, unaltered clip: a woman's voice saying, \"The Constitution Center is at the next stop.\" Then we hear the jibberish clip again, and woven inside what had sounded like nonsense, we hear \"The Constitution Center is at the next stop.\"\n\nThe point is: When our brains know what to expect to hear, they do, even if, in reality, it is impossible. Not one person could decipher that clip without knowing what they were hearing, but with the prompt, it's impossible not to hear the message in the jibberish.\n\nThis is a wonderful audio illusion.\n\nThe reason is that we still think of our senses\u2014sight, hearing, touch\u2014as reflecting the outside world, purely. But they don't. They provide us with a mixture of the world out there and our own expectations.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Feel your brain at work as it transforms gibberish into an intelligible sentence", "author": "Alexis C.
