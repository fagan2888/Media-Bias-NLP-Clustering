John Kasich is cruising to re-election in part for things out of his control \u2013 a nationwide economic recovery that has pumped jobs and hope into Ohio, and the implosion of the campaign of his Democratic challenger, Cuyahoga County Executive Ed FitzGerald.\n\nBut also as a matter of political reality, Republican Kasich deserves that re-election. He has proven himself a good governor \u2013 and an excellent fiscal manager of Ohioans' money.\n\nHis vision on issues critical to Cleveland, from the Cleveland schools plan to making the city's Opportunity Corridor a reality to protecting Lake Erie, has been transformative for Northeast Ohio.\n\nEven a strong FitzGerald would have been hard-pressed to beat Kasich, who showed foresight and political acumen by pushing through a needed Medicaid expansion that allowed Ohio access to federal funds and made this benefit of the Affordable Care Act available to low-income residents across the state.\n\nThat was a gutsy piece of leadership that had Kasich going against his own party in making an end run around the state legislature to have the State Controlling Board push it through. During Thursday's endorsement interview, Kasich said he is confident that the Medicaid expansion won't be thwarted legislatively in Ohio.\n\nKasich also showed his independence by proposing \u2013 and continuing to push for -- higher severance taxes on hydraulic fracturing for the oil and gas industry than what House Republicans have embraced.\n\nHe is more than ready for a second term during which he can solidify these and other important policies \u2013 including by naming a Lake Erie czar to oversee intensified efforts to address toxic algal blooms and by making sure that the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' shortsighted efforts to dump river dredge in Lake Erie don't continue.\n\nKasich deserves that re-election, for his vision and his efforts to be a governor of all the people, from Steubenville, to Lima, to Medina and Cleveland.\n\nAbout our editorials Editorials express the view of the Editorials express the view of the editorial board of The Plain Dealer and Northeast Ohio Media Group -- the senior leadership and editorial-writing staff.

FitzGerald's inexplicable driver's license omissions, along with his defensive and inadequate response to both revelations, overtook his ability to press his policy views.\n\nFitzGerald, 46, also tarnished his strong early record as Cuyahoga County's first elected executive with his failure to release his county parking and swipe-card records that are clearly public information.\n\nAlso in the race is Green Party candidate Anita Rios, 60, the daughter of Texas migrant workers who settled in Toledo. A mental health caseworker who is currently unemployed, Rios is articulate and committed but not ready for the governorship.\n\nKasich, 62, is ready to move Ohio significantly forward in a second term -- in part by nudging the state Republican Party closer to the middle.\n\nKasich, for instance, said during the endorsement interview that he sees no need for a right-to-work law in Ohio. That is a message the far right of his party must heed, to avoid another bruising and costly ideological fight.\n\nKasich also said he strongly supports the Common Core educational standards taking effect in Ohio this academic year. Now he must ensure that the legislature does not give in to irrational fear and derail Common Core, while also making sure schools have the resources to implement the standards.\n\nKasich already stood up to GOP lawmakers in managing to water down ill-advised legislation that froze the state's energy-conservation and renewable-energy mandates for two years.\n\nKasich, however, should have vetoed Senate Bill 310 altogether, as it contradicts his own stated vision for Ohio's energy policy, when he said in 2011 that \"our commitment to [clean alternative, renewable and advanced energy sources] shouldn't [waver] despite the fact that their costs aren't yet where we want them to be.\"\n\nThe governor needs to make sure the committee formed to study the mandates gives them a fair shake and isn't just a tool of the electric utilities and of the large energy consumers that are expected to oppose them.\n\nKasich doesn't hesitate to preen over improved employment numbers, including restoring the bulk of the 350,000 jobs lost during predecessor Ted Strickland's administration \u2013 and rightfully so.\n\nHis efforts to boost the rainy day fund to $1.5 billion and to reduce regulations have helped establish a pro-investment climate in Ohio \u2013 although the governor needs to start returning some of the surplus to localities, many of which have responded to state cuts by raising taxes at the local level.\n\nStill, the lack of transparency of Kasich's privatized JobsOhio economic development arm makes it hard to determine whether state job-attraction policies are working. With the legislature stepping in to bar the state auditor from examining JobsOhio's books in any meaningful way, it's impossible to know whether its policies are effective or justified.\n\nKasich's overall record, however, speaks to his ability to see past partisanship to issues of critical importance to all of Ohio, including urban Ohio and to those who live in Northeast Ohio. He can solidify that record with a second term focused on addressing current threats to Lake Erie, expanding the state's funding for public education, including for early education, and reinforcing the state's investment in energy innovation and the Third Frontier.\n\nHe clearly deserves the chance to do so.\n\nListen to an audio file of the Oct. 23 endorsement interview with the three candidates:", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "'algae-blooms','anita-rios','ed-fitzgerald','elections-2014','endorsements-2014','gray','jobsohio','john-kasich','ohio-governor','right-to-work-ohio','senate-bill-310','toledo-water-crisis'", "title": "John Kasich for Ohio governor: endorsement editorial", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"John Kasich for Ohio governor: endorsement editorial\", \"link\": \"http://www.cleveland.com/opinion/index.ssf/2014/10/john_kasich_for_ohio_governor.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://imgick.cleveland.com/home/cleve-media/width620/img/opinion_impact/photo/16158333-standard.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"14281360\", \"pub_date\": \"2014-10-24T08:59:24Z\", \"author\": \"Editorial Board\", \"tags\": [\"@mobile\",\"algae-blooms\",\"anita-rios\",\"ed-fitzgerald\",\"elections-2014\",\"endorsements-2014\",\"gray\",\"jobsohio\",\"john-kasich\",\"ohio-governor\",\"right-to-work-ohio\",\"senate-bill-310\",\"toledo-water-crisis\"] }", "twitter": {"image": "http://media.cleveland.com/opinion_impact/photo/16158333-thumb_square_large.jpg", "description": "The editorial board of the Northeast Ohio Media Group and The Plain Dealer endorses John Kasich for governor of Ohio.", "card": "summary", "site": "@clevelanddotcom"}, "article_date_updated": "Friday, October 24, 2014,  6:13 AM", "parsely-metadata": "{\"short_title\": \"\", \"image_url\": \"http://media.cleveland.com/opinion_impact/photo/kasich7jpg-971f605a52df2d86.jpg\", \"author_name\": \"neomgeditorial\", \"author_nickname\": \"Editorial Board\", \"author_id\": \"10948997\", \"source_blog_name\": \"Opinion, Editorials, Letters and Columns\", \"source_blog_url\": \"http://www.cleveland.com/opinion/index.ssf/\", \"sponsored_content\": \"0\" }", "og": {"site_name": "cleveland.com", "description": "The editorial board of the Northeast Ohio Media Group and The Plain Dealer endorses John Kasich for governor of Ohio.", "title": "John Kasich for Ohio governor: endorsement editorial", "url": "http://www.cleveland.com/opinion/index.ssf/2014/10/john_kasich_for_ohio_governor.html", "image": "http://www.cleveland.com/static/aff/static/img/logos/logo_fb.jpg", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "cleveland.com", "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Friday, October 24, 2014,  4:58 AM", "article_author": "Editorial Board", "Description": "The editorial board of the Northeast Ohio Media Group and The Plain Dealer endorses John Kasich for governor of Ohio."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcaf2c\"", "article_summary": "Kasich's overall record, however, speaks to his ability to see past partisanship to issues of critical importance to all of Ohio, including urban Ohio and to those who live in Northeast Ohio.\n\u2022 Email general questions or comments about the editorial board to Elizabeth Sullivan, opinion director for the Northeast Ohio Media Group.\nDuring Thursday's endorsement interview, Kasich said he is confident that the Medicaid expansion won't be thwarted legislatively in Ohio.\nAbout our editorials Editorials express the view of the Editorials express the view of the editorial board of The Plain Dealer and Northeast Ohio Media Group -- the senior leadership and editorial-writing staff.\nKasich, for instance, said during the endorsement interview that he sees no need for a right-to-work law in Ohio."}
