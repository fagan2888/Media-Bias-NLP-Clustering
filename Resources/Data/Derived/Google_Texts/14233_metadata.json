Dr. Gruber is responsible for the words on that video. I just found it. It was out there in plain sight. I\u2019m just finding it and showing it to people,\u201d Weinstein said.\n\nHe told WPHT morning host Chris Stigall that he was inspired to investigate some of the architects of the ACA after he and his family were one of the many people kicked off their insurance about a year ago. Weinstein didn\u2019t have confidence in the mainstream media and politicians to get to the bottom of it.\n\n\u201cYou just knew that [the politicians] weren\u2019t telling the truth and the media was simply cheerleading either for or against the law,\u201d he said.\n\nWeinstein has been sifting through hours of video of Dr. David Cutler, Zeke Emanuel, and Dr. Gruber since, but he only found this video within the past week. Weinstein teased that this is not even the most damning of what he has found.\n\n\u201cI think that it might actually come out today\u2026I have an idea of what\u2019s going to come out, and I think that it\u2019s going to be crazy.\u201d\n\nHe hinted to WPHT\u2019s Chris Stigall that the people with Megyn Kelly and Fox News are trying to get a comment from the White House on one of his videos. Even though has been reached out to by the likes of Kelly and CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper, he maintains that there is nothing special about what he did, and says that any other everyday citizen could do it too.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just a regular person\u2026I\u2019m an investment advisor\u2026If I can make a difference, anybody can make a difference. All I did was explore Google. If you have a subject that\u2019s really bothering you, go figure it out.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Weinstein has now made news for leaking a video that depicts one of the architects of the Affordable Care Act encouraging a lack of transparency in government.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"url": "http://philadelphia.cbslocal.com/2014/11/12/richard-weinstein-affordable-care-act-passed-because-of-the-stupidity-of-the-american-people/", "image": {"width": 830, "secure_url": "https://cbsphilly.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/3-on-your-side.jpg?w=830", "identifier": "https://cbsphilly.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/3-on-your-side.jpg?w=830", "height": 469}, "type": "article", "description": "Weinstein has now made news for leaking a video that depicts one of the architects of the Affordable Care Act encouraging a lack of transparency in government.", "title": "Richard Weinstein: Affordable Care Act Authors Used The 'Stupidity Of The American People'"}, "twitter": {"site": "CBSphilly", "image": "https://cbsphilly.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/3-on-your-side.jpg?w=830", "description": "Weinstein has now made news for leaking a video that depicts one of the architects of the Affordable Care Act encouraging a lack of transparency in government.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Richard Weinstein: Affordable Care Act Authors Used The 'Stupidity Of The American People'"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "News, Sports, Weather, Traffic and Philly's Top Spots", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "application-name": "CBS Philly", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/cbsphilly", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/cbsphilly"}, "keywords": "1210 wpht, affordable care act, chris stigall, democrats, health insurance, obamacare, republicans, richard weinstein aca information, affordable care act, audio, blogs, heard on, politics, politics, syndicated local, watch + listen", "google-site-verification": "44caXBf4kjHeKKAT7ZZ89NaCX25utL_yRSa-qGpwIhY", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://philadelphia.cbslocal.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/40f9fbf792243f0932e0cab4dbd46d10?s=16", "news_keywords": "1210 wpht, affordable care act, chris stigall, democrats, health insurance, obamacare, republicans, richard weinstein"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd88bf\"", "article_summary": "Dr. Gruber is responsible for the words on that video.\nWeinstein didn\u2019t have confidence in the mainstream media and politicians to get to the bottom of it.\n\u201cI\u2019m not responsible for the words on that video.\nPHILADELPHIA (CBS) \u2014 According to Richard Weinstein, voters have a right to know that the authors of the Affordable Care Act think it passed because of the \u201cstupidity of the American voter.\u201dWeinstein has now made news for leaking a video that depicts one of the architects of the Affordable Care Act encouraging a lack of transparency in government.\nWeinstein has been sifting through hours of video of Dr. David Cutler, Zeke Emanuel, and Dr. Gruber since, but he only found this video within the past week."}
