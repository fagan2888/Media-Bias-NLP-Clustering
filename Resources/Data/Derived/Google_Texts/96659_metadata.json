Pre-election polls had forecast losses only in Taipei, Taichung and Keelung.\n\nPremier Jiang Yi-huah \u2014 the head of the Cabinet \u2014 resigned Saturday night after the defeats, while President Ma Ying-jeou, who is also Nationalist Party chairman, said he would make changes.\n\n\u201cI must express apologies to the Nationalist Party and its supporters for making everyone disappointed,\u201d Ma told a news conference. \u201cI\u2019ve received the message people have sent via these elections. It\u2019s my responsibility and I will quickly offer a party reform plan to address everyone\u2019s demands. I won\u2019t avoid responsibility.\u201d\n\nThe heavy losses point to an electorate that is souring on Ma\u2019s forging of closer ties with mainland China. The defeats will make it tougher for the Nationalists to hold onto the presidency in 2016 and jeopardize six years of landmark talks with China that have led to 21 agreements.\n\nThose trade and investment deals have lifted Taiwan\u2019s half-trillion-dollar economy, while raising Beijing\u2019s hopes for political reunification. Beijing has claimed sovereignty over Taiwan since the Chinese civil war of the 1940s, but since taking office in 2008, Ma has set aside the old disputes to ease tensions through talks.\n\nTaiwanese have been watching closely as Beijing takes a hard-line stance on demands for democratic rule in Hong Kong, a semiautonomous Chinese city that has been gripped by more two months of pro-democracy protests.\n\n\u201cWe want to send the Nationalists a warning,\u201d said Lin Wen-chih, a 48-year-old film producer who voted for the winning independent Taipei mayoral candidate, Ko Wen-je. \u201cTaiwan is an independent country. We don\u2019t want the Nationalists to take measures that would have it eaten up (by China).\u201d\n\nPreliminary results show that the chief opposition Democratic Progressive Party gained most in Saturday\u2019s vote. The DPP favors continuing talks with China\u2019s Communist leadership, but disputes the dialogue framework that binds the two sides under Beijing\u2019s jurisdiction, instead preferring talks in an international setting.\n\nA weakened Nationalist Party, also known as the Kuomintang, or KMT, may erode Ma\u2019s mandate before 2016 to sign a pact with China to cut import tariffs, set up official representative offices on both sides and push for a meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping. If the opposition party wins the presidency, Beijing is likely to suspend deals with Taiwan.\n\nAlan Romberg, East Asia Program director with the Stimson Institute, a think tank in Washington, said the opposition party remains a wild card in Taiwan-China relations.\n\n\u201cThe Democratic Progressive Party has made a number of adjustments over time, moving from outright opposition to various economic ties to acceptance of such ties as important,\u201d he said.\n\nWhen Democratic Progressive Party President Chen Shui-bian ruled the island from 2000 to 2008, he angered China by advocating for constitutional independence. Beijing threatened then to use force to stop the move.\n\nIn March, Ma\u2019s government faced thousands of student-led protesters who occupied parliament and nearby streets in Taipei to stop ratification of a service trade liberalization agreement with China.\n\n\u201cThe electorate in general is not happy with the KMT running the country overall, and they\u2019re also not happy with the local administration run by the KMT, and they want to have someone new to be in office,\u201d Democratic Progressive Party Secretary-General Joseph Wu said.\n\nTaiwanese elected a total 11,130 people to local offices Saturday after months of fierce campaigning marked by personal insults, truck-mounted loudspeakers and firecracker shows.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Taiwan's pro-China ruling Nationalist Party suffered stronger-than-expected defeats in municipal elections Saturday, dealing a stiff blow to a president who has staked his reputation on closer ties with Beijing, and leading the premier to resign.", "Author": "Ralph Jennings", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Taiwan\u2019s pro-China ruling Nationalist Party suffered stronger-than-expected defeats in municipal elections Saturday, dealing a stiff blow to a president who has staked his reputation on closer ties with Beijing, and leading the premier to resign.", "title": "Taiwan\u2019s pro-China ruling Nationalist Party dealt setback in local polls", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/nov/29/taiwan-pro-china-ruling-nationalist-party-election/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/11/29/taiwan-electionjpeg-03472.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/11/29/taiwan-electionjpeg-03472.jpg", "title": "Taiwan\u2019s pro-China ruling Nationalist Party dealt setback in loc", "description": "Taiwan's pro-China ruling Nationalist Party suffered stronger-than-expected defeats in municipal elections Saturday, dealing a stiff blow to a president who has staked his reputation on closer ties wi", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "news_keywords": "Politics, China, Beijing, Taipei, Ma Ying Jeou"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd97e\"", "article_summary": "\u201cI must express apologies to the Nationalist Party and its supporters for making everyone disappointed,\u201d Ma told a news conference.\nWhen Democratic Progressive Party President Chen Shui-bian ruled the island from 2000 to 2008, he angered China by advocating for constitutional independence.\nAlan Romberg, East Asia Program director with the Stimson Institute, a think tank in Washington, said the opposition party remains a wild card in Taiwan-China relations.\nPremier Jiang Yi-huah \u2014 the head of the Cabinet \u2014 resigned Saturday night after the defeats, while President Ma Ying-jeou, who is also Nationalist Party chairman, said he would make changes.\nIf the opposition party wins the presidency, Beijing is likely to suspend deals with Taiwan."}
