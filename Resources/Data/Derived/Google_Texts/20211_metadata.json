In addition to presenting his own opinions, Obama responded to questions submitted by users of two blogs with large followings in the Charlotte area\u2014BlogHer and SheKnows.\n\nDespite its trouble passing through Congress, Obama lauded the controversial Paycheck Fairness Act because of its capacity to address income disparity between men and women. This proposal would make it legal for employees to share compensation data in an effort to better inform employees who suspect they may have been discriminated against.\n\n\"When women succeed here in America then the whole country succeeds,\" Obama said.\n\nTo illustrate his personal connection to the gender wage gap, Obama discussed his experiences watching his grandmother navigate challenges of being a female income earner. Despite being the primary wage-earner in his family, he said she was compensated unfairly compared to men in similar positions, one of the many anecdotes he used to inspire the crowd during the discussion about wage inequality. He then transitioned from discussion of past wage discrimination to modern economic challenges that must be addressed by referencing his two teenage daughters.\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got two daughters, I expect them to be treated the same as somebody\u2019s sons who are on the job,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nThe conversation about equality of women in the workforce resonated with many in the audience of approximately 200, including Deidre Coleman, a Charlotte mother of a four-year-old girl.\n\n\u201cHopefully by the time [my daughter] is out in the world, everything will come to fruition and she will be able to get equal pay for her equal education,\" she said.\n\nOne of the main challenges Obama acknowledged regarding equal wages was the lack of representation of women in Science, Technology, Engineering and Math\u2014commonly known as STEM\u2014careers. He cited better access to educational opportunities as one way of overcoming the issue.\n\nObama noted that access to early childhood education could expose students to STEM fields from a young age. However, he pointed out that the average cost of childcare in North Carolina is $16,000 per year, which can mean access to quality care is cost-prohibitive for many families. When students do not have access to early childhood education, they are already entering elementary school at a disadvantage, he said. One of his goals is to reform the current tax code to give more families access to early childhood education, despite skeptics that doubt how realistic such initiatives would be given current federal budget constraints.\n\n\u201cWe know [education] is the smartest investment we can make as a society,\u201d Obama said. \u201cPeople say, well that\u2019d be nice if we could afford it. But the truth is if we closed a few corporate tax loopholes that are not contributing to the economy right now, then we could afford it.\u201d\n\n\n\nIssues related to the cost of higher education also arose during the discussion, with Obama pointing to the availability of online learning options, improvement of loan counseling prior to borrowing and better academic support systems as potential initiatives to address increasing costs. He highlighted the state\u2019s historic emphasis on higher education and called on legislators to renew that focus.\n\n\"North Carolina did better economically than other parts of the mid-Atlantic and Southeast because of the Research Triangle and emphasis on education,\" Obama said.\n\nThe passage of the Affordable Care Act\u2014which mandated large employers to offer health insurance to their employees\u2014was another positive Obama cited when the topic of discussion shifted to healthcare. He lauded Microsoft for refusing to collaborate with companies that don\u2019t offer paid sick leave for their employees while acknowledging the future progress needed in that area of economic policy as well.\n\n\u201cHealthcare should be a right, not a privilege, in this country,\u201d he said.\n\nEven for those who work in more affluent industries that provide more robust benefits, Wednesday's discussion showed that policymakers and businesses still have more work to do. Among them was Christine Nelson, a public defender who attended the event.\n\n\u201cIn terms of empowering women, even in the legal field where it\u2019s a male dominated field, it's important that people are working for us to make sure that we\u2019re seen as equals,\u201d she said.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://ds4q8c259towh.cloudfront.net/20160415XJlq9-dXcb/dist/img/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ffffff", "description": "The Chronicle is Duke University's independent student newspaper where you can find campus news, Blue Devil sports coverage, features, opinions and breaking news online and in print four days a week.", "generator": "Gryphon 20160217001 (Foundry 6.1-20150615001)", "og": {"site_name": "The Chronicle", "description": "The Chronicle is Duke University's independent student newspaper where you can find campus news, Blue Devil sports coverage, features, opinions and breaking news online and in print four days a week.", "title": "President Obama visits Charlotte, talks education and workforce equity", "url": "http://www.dukechronicle.com/article/2015/04/president-obama-visits-charlotte-talks-education-and-workforce-equity", "image": "http://ds4q8c259towh.cloudfront.net/20160415XJlq9-dXcb/dist/img/dtc-ph.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@DukeChronicle", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "TheChronicle", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://ds4q8c259towh.cloudfront.net/20160415XJlq9-dXcb/dist/img/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "application-name": "TheChronicle", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca8fa\"", "article_summary": "\"North Carolina did better economically than other parts of the mid-Atlantic and Southeast because of the Research Triangle and emphasis on education,\" Obama said.\nPresident Obama visits Charlotte, talks education and workforce equityBy Sarah Kerman | Thursday, April 16 2015Photo by Khloe Kim | The ChronicleCHARLOTTE, N.C.\u2014President Barack Obama held a private town-hall discussion addressing obstacles facing working-class families and women at a local children's library Wednesday afternoon.\nHe cited better access to educational opportunities as one way of overcoming the issue.\n\u201cHopefully by the time [my daughter] is out in the world, everything will come to fruition and she will be able to get equal pay for her equal education,\" she said.\nObama noted that access to early childhood education could expose students to STEM fields from a young age."}
