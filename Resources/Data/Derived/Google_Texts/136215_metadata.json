Cannon: On health care, Walker and Rubio offer Obamacare lite\n\n\n\nREPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL candidates Gov. Scott Walker and Sen. Marco Rubio have put forward plans to repeal and replace Obamacare. Unfortunately, their \u201creplace\u201d proposals are best described as \u201cObamacare lite.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe centerpiece of both \u201creplace\u201d plans is a refundable tax credit for health insurance. Yet such tax credits already exist, in Obamacare. Also like Obamacare, the Walker/Rubio tax credits would allow Washington to decide how much coverage you purchase, penalize you if you don\u2019t buy that government-defined plan, and conceal massive redistribution of income under the rubric of tax cuts.\n\n\n\nWhy bother repealing Obamacare, only to recreate its worst features?\n\n\n\nConservatives who lean toward tax credits cry slander when critics label them Obamacare lite \u2014 just as conservatives who supported an individual mandate in the 1990s cried slander when critics argued it amounted to a government takeover of health care. But let\u2019s look at the facts.\n\n\n\nA health-insurance tax credit functions exactly like an individual mandate. Under both proposals, if you choose not to buy a government-designed health plan \u2014 even if you want to buy coverage, just less than the government requires \u2014 the IRS takes more of your money. Under Walker\u2019s plan, the effective penalty can reach $7,800 for a family of four.\n\n\n\nUnder a tax credit, Washington would exercise as much control over your health plan as it does under Obamacare\u2019s individual mandate. Just as Congress must define what level of coverage lets you avoid that explicit penalty, it would define what level of coverage lets you avoid a tax credit\u2019s implicit penalty. Special interests would have the same incentive and ability to force you to buy coverage you don\u2019t want, as with Obamacare.\n\n\n\nAgain like Obamacare, the Walker/Rubio tax credits are \u201crefundable.\u201d So if you have no income-tax liability, or if it\u2019s just less than the amount of the credit, you get a check from the government. We don\u2019t have numbers on Walker\u2019s or Rubio\u2019s plans, but Obamacare\u2019s \u201ctax credits\u201d are roughly 80 percent government spending. With a Republican imprimatur on such spending, Obamacare supporters could probably increase spending more than they could under Obamacare itself.\n\n\n\nHow would Walker and Rubio pay for their new spending? Would they keep Obamacare\u2019s tax increases? Raise taxes elsewhere? Would they finance new health care spending by cutting existing health care programs? If so, chalk up yet another way their plans would resemble Obamacare.\n\n\n\nConservatives can offer a better \u201creplace\u201d plan that is politically feasible by expanding a bedrock conservative initiative: health savings accounts, or HSAs, which have already enabled 14.5 million Americans to save more than $28.4 billion for their medical expenses tax-free.\n\n\n\nExpanding HSAs would give workers a $9 trillion effective tax cut, without cutting spending or increasing the deficit, and would drastically reduce government control over Americans\u2019 health decisions. Most important, \u201clarge\u201d HSAs would spur innovations that make health care better, cheaper, and more secure \u2014 particularly for the most vulnerable.\n\n\n\nBecause Congress does not tax employer-paid health insurance premiums, the vast majority of Americans with private coverage get it through an employer. Yet employers finance such coverage with money they would otherwise pay workers \u2014 an average of $12,000 per worker with family coverage, for a total of $735 billion this year, and $9.1 trillion over 10 years.\n\n\n\nLarge HSAs would let workers take that money as a tax-free HSA contribution, and thereby let taxpayers own and control $9 trillion of their earnings that someone else currently controls. That\u2019s an effective tax cut equal to all of the Reagan and Bush tax cuts combined, and nine times more than taxes would fall by repealing Obamacare. Workers could use those funds to remain in their employer plan, purchase better coverage elsewhere, buy medical care directly, or save for future medical needs. All tax-free.\n\n\n\nMoreover, Large HSAs involve no income redistribution and create no dependence on government. They would bring health care within reach of those with low-incomes by turning hundreds of millions of other Americans into cost-conscious consumers who force prices downward.\n\n\n\nAs with tax credits, government would define which health plans consumers could purchase with tax-free Large HSA funds. But those rules would be far less restrictive because consumers wouldn\u2019t have to buy coverage to get the tax benefits. Few special interests would demand mandated coverage of their services if they know consumers have the freedom not to buy it. Large HSAs would thus allow innovations that Obamacare and tax credits inhibit, including higher deductibles, health plans with a total-satisfaction guarantee, and pre-existing-conditions insurance.\n\n\n\nFor decades, prominent conservatives advocated an individual mandate. The left then picked up the idea and gave us Obamacare. Before they once again fall into the same trap, conservatives should drop any support for the implicit mandate of health-insurance tax credits. Expanding HSAs is more compassionate and provides a direct route toward freedom and better health care.\n\n\n\nMichael F.
