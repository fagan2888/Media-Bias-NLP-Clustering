A man was killed on New Year’s Eve after he fell off a train-station platform and landed on the track just as a train was pulling in.

The accident occurred around 10:30 p.m. at DART’s Walnut Hill Station, just a few feet from Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital Dallas east of N. Central Expressway. Dallas Area Rapid Transit spokesman Mark Ball says that according to witnesses, “the man fell from the platform onto the tracks as a southbound Red Line train pulled into the Walnut Hill station.”

Ball says the man “was under the train for a bit” before rescue workers freed him and transported him to the hospital.

“He was breathing, but not conscious when he was taken to Presbyterian,” says Ball. “He died at the hospital just before 11:30 p.m.”

The man has not been named, and the Dallas County Medical Examiner’s Office says his next of kin has not yet been notified.
