They noted that Olivarius-Mcallister is from the United Kingdom before making crude comments about women from the U.K.\n\n\u201cThe sheriff is aware,\u201d Dan Bender, spokesperson for the sheriff\u2019s office, told The Post. A few minutes after speaking with The Post, Bender issued a statement with Smith\u2019s apology.\n\n\u201cI would like to apologize to Miss Mcallister, a reporter with the Durango Herald, and the citizens of La Plata County for this unprofessional incident involving inappropriate comments made by members of my staff,\u201d Smith said in the statement. \u201cI do not condone this type of behavior as it is in direct conflict with the new culture I am trying to develop at the La Plata County Sheriff\u2019s Office.\u201d\n\nThe statement said the sheriff is taking \u201cimmediate steps to deal with the deputies involved,\u201d but it did not say what that would entail. Smith called the reporter Thursday night to apologize.\n\nRichard Ballantine, chairman of the Herald\u2019s governing board, said in a statement emailed to the Post: \u201cThese are unfortunate comments from anyone, especially from public employees. The Herald condemns this kind of language. We have confidence in Sheriff Sean Smith taking proper action.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "La Plata Sheriff apologizes for derogatory comments made by deputies", "title": "La Plata Sheriff apologizes for derogatory comments made by deputies", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/08/28/la-plata-sheriff-apologizes-for-derogatory-comments-made-by-deputies/", "image": {"width": 445, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150828__Untitledp1.jpg", "height": 403}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150828__Untitledp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-08-28T16:44:12+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-22T06:08:41+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fccabe\"", "article_summary": "The La Plata County Sheriff has apologized after an incident that involved three deputies accidentally leaving a crude voice mail for a female reporter at the Durango Herald.\nSheriff Sean Smith issued a public apology minutes after The Denver Post asked for comment from the department.\nHe and two other deputies proceeded to denigrate the reporter, making derogatory statements about her appearance.\nWe have confidence in Sheriff Sean Smith taking proper action.\u201d\nRichard Ballantine, chairman of the Herald\u2019s governing board, said in a statement emailed to the Post: \u201cThese are unfortunate comments from anyone, especially from public employees."}
