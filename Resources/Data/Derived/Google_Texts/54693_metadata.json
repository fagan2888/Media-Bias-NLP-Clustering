Gov. Dean also has another speech scheduled for September 23 at the Saint Anselm College New Hampshire Institute of Politics.\n\nThe speaking engagements have many speculating as to whether Dean might be considering another run for President of the United States.\n\nDean says that\u2019s unlikely, but did have several comments about the Affordable Care Act and the Health Care Exchange right here in Vermont. He says the system that will be put into place has problems:\n\n\"I'm intending to support Hillary, assuming she runs,\" Dean said.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe that rate-based regulation or even individual budget-based regulation is going to work. I think we have to get rid of fee-for-service medicine,\u201d said Dean.\n\nDean penned an Op-Ed in the Wall Street Journal in July, and was critical of the Independent Payment Advisory Board. VPR\u2019s Hamilton Davis responded to some of Dean\u2019s thoughts in a conversation with Mitch Wertlieb on August. 7th.\n\nDean says that Vermont is doing a better job than most states, but there are still problems with a system where the more procedures physicians perform, the more they get paid. He took to Twitter to continue the debate:\n\n@CitizenCohn I want to end fee for service medicine because it creates global budgets, encourages investment in wellness, not illness \u2014 Howard Dean (@GovHowardDean) July 30, 2013\n\nDean explained that he feels the incentive should be on long-term wellness rather than treating patients after they are already very sick.\n\n\u201cWhat we should be incentivized to do is keep people out of hospitals, out of MRI machines, out of ICUs. If you got rid of fee-for-service and pay people by the patient, then the whole emphasis would be to keep people healthy. And finally, we\u2019d have a wellness system. But we don\u2019t get paid to keep people well in this system that we have. We get paid when they get really sick,\u201d said Dean.\n\nAs for future political aspirations, Dean says a Presidential run is unlikely, but didn\u2019t rule out the possibility.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m intending to support Hillary, assuming she runs. So the answer is it\u2019s unlikely. I often not-so-jokingly say it\u2019s easy to get in the first time because you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re getting into. But the second time you should see a psychiatrist, hopefully not on a fee-for-service basis,\u201d said Dean.", "article_metadata": {"category": "VPR News", "description": "Former Vermont Governor Howard Dean made waves when he spoke at an AFL-CIO conference in Iowa last month.
