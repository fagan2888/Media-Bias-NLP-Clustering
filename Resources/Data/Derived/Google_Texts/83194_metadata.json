Advantage and IU Health Plans even talked about merging back in 2013 before talks broke down.\n\n\n\nNow, Indianapolis-based Anthem\u2019s advantages in size and resources are set to grow even larger after the insurer announced July 24 it will buy Connecticut-based Cigna Corp. for $54.2 billion in cash, stock and debt.\n\n\n\nExperts say the deal will give Anthem an even greater edge over smaller rivals in negotiating leverage with hospital systems and in resources to invest in consumer-friendly technology and marketing.\n\n\n\nThe combined Anthem and Cigna would create a company with more than $115 billion in revenue and $5 billion in profits. Just in Indiana last year, Anthem reported revenue of $4.9 billion and profit of $389 million.\n\n\n\nBy contrast, Advantage\u2019s revenue was $407 million last year, while IU Health Plans\u2019 revenue was $132 million. Two other health plans created by health care providers\u2014Physicians Health Plan in Fort Wayne and SIHO Insurance in Columbus\u2014are even smaller.\n\n\n\nBut the leaders of those plans say the future of health care is in their favor, not in the older model mastered by Anthem, which negotiated the largest discounts with providers and then sold access to them to employers.\n\n\n\nThe future, spurred on by changes from Obamacare, will hinge on close collaborations between health plans and providers that reward doctors and hospitals for keeping patients healthier\u2014and their medical spending lower.\n\nPerry Perry\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what we\u2019ve been doing for years,\u201d said Vicki Perry, CEO of Indianapolis-based Advantage, which is owned by St. Vincent Health, Franciscan St. Francis Health and two other hospital systems. She expects the consolidation of Anthem and Cigna, as well as a $37 billion deal that would unite Hartford-based Aetna Inc. and Louisville-based Humana Inc., to open up gaps in local markets.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe mergers, if approved, we believe that this could create a lot of good opportunities for growth in the small to midsize groups,\u201d she said.\n\n\n\nRough start\n\n\n\nMaybe so, but the first year of Obamacare\u2019s reforms to the health insurance market were not kind to Advantage and its peers.\n\n\n\nAdvantage recorded a loss of $10.7 million, according to its annual financial filing with the Indiana Department of Insurance. Advantage had also lost $9 million in 2012.\n\n\n\nThose losses forced St. Vincent and Franciscan to each pour $6 million in cash into Advantage last year. Messages left for representatives of the hospital systems were not returned.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe infusion from our partners just shows their commitment to our strategy,\u201d Perry said.\n\n\n\nThat strategy has involved doubling the size of its Medicare Advantage population over the past two years, to 22,500 seniors.\n\n\n\nMedicare Advantage is an alternative to traditional Medicare in which the federal program pays private insurers to handle the health benefits of seniors that choose their plan. More than three of every 10 Medicare beneficiaries are now covered by such plans.\n\n\n\nBut ramping up its Medicare business comes with temporary financial challenges, Perry noted. When a health plan first signs up a Medicare Advantage customer, the Medicare program assumes that person will have modest medical spending. Perry estimated Medicare\u2019s initial payments are about 70 percent, on average, of what members truly cost to insure.\n\n\n\nIt takes Advantage about 18 months to fully document that its members have more illnesses than the Medicare program assumed, and to get \u201ctrue up\u201d payments to cover the extra services needed to treat those illnesses.\n\n\n\nThe other problem is Obamacare\u2019s new taxes on health insurers. Advantage shelled out a whopping $8.3 million for those taxes for 2014.\n\n\n\nSome of that stems from the 50,000 Hoosiers Advantage insures. (It also handles another 36,000 Hoosiers in self-funded employer health plans, which are taxed separately.)\n\n\n\nBut a lot of those taxes come from Advantage\u2019s Medicare customers. Medicare rules do not allow Advantage or other health plans to include those taxes in its pricing for Medicare Advantage until after it has already paid them.\n\n\n\nFor a plan like Advantage that is growing its Medicare business, that means a lot of new customers whose premiums aren\u2019t covering the Obamacare taxes.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s difficult to get ahead of that,\u201d Perry said.\n\n\n\nIU Health also took a large hit from Obamacare taxes, paying nearly $1.8 million, according to its annual financial filing at the Indiana Department of Insurance.\n\n\n\nThat fee, along with increased investments to launch into new markets, led IU Health to a $2 million loss in 2014. IU Health spent more on marketing to launch itself onto the Obamacare exchanges in three small Indiana markets and to start growing its presence in the employer market.\n\n\n\nIt seems to be working. IU Health\u2019s employer accounts have grown from 50,000 people to 80,000 since last year. It added 1,600 Medicare Advantage members last year, boosting its total to 10,400. And it signed up 1,200 more customers on the Obamacare exchanges this year.\n\n\n\nThe IU Health hospital system, which gave IU Health Plans $4 million last year, appears ready to spend money now to pick up business.\n\n\n\nFor 2016, IU Health Plans is growing its Medicare Advantage plan from 33 counties to 75. And IU Health Plans is expanding its Obamacare exchange presence from 17 to 62 counties\u2014including the Indianapolis area. On the exchanges, IU Health Plans also requested a 16.5-percent price cut that, if approved, would make them about 11 percent cheaper than market leader Anthem.\n\n\n\nLast, IU Health Plans is planning a big push into the employer market next year. Its message is that, by choosing IU Health\u2019s narrow network of providers (which includes IU Health facilities as well as some independent practices, such as Indianapolis-based American Health Network), IU Health Plans can keep patients healthier and spending less.\n\n\n\n\u201cBecause we don\u2019t include the universe of all available physicians, it\u2019s much easier for us to engage them in programs that lead to these results,\u201d said Jim Parker, president of IU Health Plans.\n\n\n\nBetting on broad\n\n\n\nBy contrast, large insurers such as Anthem and Minnesota-based UnitedHealthcare have typically offered broad-network plans that include nearly all doctors and hospitals. That has appealed to employers, giving Anthem and United large market shares and the big brand names that go with that, as well as huge negotiating leverage with doctors and hospitals.\n\n\n\nAnthem\u2019s combination with Cigna could boost its negotiating leverage even more and, the companies hope, give them the numbers needed to invest in the resources to keep patients healthier. That could include expensive IT tools for patients. Or it could be the myriad medical specialists necessary to manage care for patients with diabetes, heart disease, mental health issues or cancer.\n\n\n\n\u201cIf we thought they had an advantage before in terms of investment, now that they\u2019ve doubled their size, think what that means,\u201d said Dhan Shapurji, an Indianapolis-based health plan consultant for Deloitte.\n\n\n\nThat said, he thinks provider-owned plans can save money via narrow networks and managing patients\u2019 health and\u2014if they do that successfully\u2014could negate the size advantage of the big players. It\u2019s just not clear yet which set of offerings will get traction in the marketplace.\n\n\n\nFort Wayne-based Physicians Health Plan of Northern Indiana is betting it can keep costs down with a mix of efforts to keep patients healthier, partnerships with hospitals that want to keep some of their business out of Anthem\u2019s hands, and technology companies that are trying to develop solutions for small health plans.\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m hopeful that\u2019s how we\u2019re going to be able to compete,\u201d said Mike Cahill, president of Physicians Health Plan. \u201cJust trying to slug it out with Anthem and United head-to-head, that\u2019s a losing proposition.\u201d\u2022", "article_metadata": {"description": "Mega-mergers among Anthem Inc. and its fellow health insurance giants could put pressure on provider-owned health plans such as Advantage Health Solutions and Indiana University Health Plans.
