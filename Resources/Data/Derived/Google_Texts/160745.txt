Zach Miller was given substantial attention Saturday.

As the leading scorer for the University of Denver lacrosse team, visiting Rutgers had a keen eye on the true freshman from the Seneca Nation of Indians in New York.

Because of this weekend’s Denver March Powwow at the Denver Coliseum — and the event organizer’s interest in Miller — the 19-year-old was the center of attention at Peter Barton Lacrosse Stadium.

He didn’t disappoint in front of a snowed-over crowd that included his mother, four siblings, the Medicine Heart Dancers and American Indian drummers and singers. Miller tied for a team-high four points to help lead the Pioneers to a 17-11 victory in their Big East Conference debut.

“I didn’t see the dancers (at halftime), but I knew they were going to be here,” Miller said. “It means a lot, seeing that I have all the support behind me, that people are really looking up to me — especially the native community. Having my family out here is awesome, and we went to the Powwow (on Friday night) to get a little taste of home.”

Freshman midfielder Tyler Pace (four goals), sophomore attack Jack Bobzien (three goals) and senior middie Jeremy Noble (three assists) also had four-point games in DU’s fourth consecutive victory.
