I\u2019m beginning to feel that a change needs to be made. And that comes in response to conversations with our network partners. It comes in response to fan data that we look at. We\u2019re constantly surveying our fans to get their sense of what they see out on the floor. I\u2019m talking to players and general managers, and our owners of course.\u201d\n\nChange would be difficult, because though some coaches say they hate using the strategy, they clearly believe it can be effective. Silver said league data shows it is being used at a 5 1/2 times greater rate than last season.\n\nMostly used on Shaquille O\u2019Neal when he played, coaches now find Houston\u2019s Dwight Howard, Detroit\u2019s Andre Drummond and the Clippers\u2019 DeAndre Jordan to be targets. And though it slows the game and has drawn more criticism this season as techniques such as jumping on a player\u2019s back during a free throw or fouling an inbounds passer have increased, nobody seems to have a good solution.\n\nSilver said a rule change would require approval by 20 of the league\u2019s 30 teams.\n\n\u201cSo we\u2019re nowhere near that point where we\u2019re even starting to count heads,\u201d Silver said. \u201cAnd I think there is a reason when the constitution and bylaws were written of the NBA that those founders decided that it should take two-thirds of teams to change a rule. I think it should be a very deliberate process, you know, and nothing should be done harshly, which is why I\u2019m not in favor of changing the rule midseason.\u201d\n\nSo he believes owners will consider it at their April meeting with the hope of having something to vote on during their July meeting.\n\nSilver began his remarks on a somber note by sending his condolences to Oklahoma City assistant coach Monty Williams and his five children. Williams\u2019 wife, Ingrid, was killed this week after a car accident.\n\nHe praised Toronto as host of the NBA\u2019s first All-Star Game not in the U.S. despite its frigid temperatures, joking that the events are indoors. He said the league is always trying to take its game to Europe, but that it remains difficult without further changes to the schedule.\n\n\u201cNow, having said that, one of the things that we\u2019re continuing to talk to the Players Association about is the length of the season, the length of the preseason, when it is we should start the league, when it is that we should ultimately finish and get the draft in,\u201d Silver said.\n\n\u201cSo having an All-Star Game internationally has to be part of those larger discussions. It\u2019s something we\u2019d love to do one day. It\u2019s not going to happen in the next two, three, four years, but I think down the road it could be a really exciting element for the NBA.\u201d\n\nNext year\u2019s All-Star Game is in Charlotte, North Carolina. No plans are set beyond that.\n\nSilver added he wanted to see the draft remain in June.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Adam Silver: No \u201cHack-a-Shaq\u201d rules change this NBA season", "title": "Adam Silver: No \u201cHack-a-Shaq\u201d rules change this NBA season", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/02/13/adam-silver-no-hack-a-shaq-rules-change-this-nba-season/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160213__BN20160214_C6_BNSP14ALLSTARPLUGp1.jpg", "height": 447}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160213__BN20160214_C6_BNSP14ALLSTARPLUGp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2016-02-13T22:02:45+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-18T02:46:50+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "TORONTO \u2014 Adam Silver said Saturday no changes are coming to Hack-a-Shaq this season, though he seems to favor some rule adjustment.\n\u201cSo having an All-Star Game internationally has to be part of those larger discussions.\nHe praised Toronto as host of the NBA\u2019s first All-Star Game not in the U.S. despite its frigid temperatures, joking that the events are indoors.\nSilver said league data shows it is being used at a 5 1/2 times greater rate than last season.\nSilver said the strategy of intentionally fouling poor shooters away from the ball has increased this season, which has caused him to rethink his stance."}
