Gen. Ion Mihai Pacepa, who defected to the U.S. in 1978 after serving as Romanian President Nicolae Ceausescu\u2019s top official, was praised by the current Romanian government in an Aug. 16 letter and invited to visit the country as an honored guest. The government wants him to enlighten a new generation in Romania about the tyranny of the communist era in response to revisionists attempting to rehabilitate the Ceausescu regime.\n\nAngered by the official restoration of Pacepa and his revealing new expose of communism\u2019s continuing war against the West, \u201cDisinformation,\u201d a group of Romanian lawyers and human rights activists are preparing documentation to be sent to The Hague to prosecute him, according to a Romanian blog.\n\nIn addition, a contributor to an Internet forum commenting on the National Catholic Register\u2019s review of Pacepa\u2019s new book identified himself as a Romanian prosecutor and an attorney active in the field of human rights who is familiar with the plan.\n\n\u201cI am aware that Pacepa\u2019s crimes will be brought before the International Criminal Court of Justice for crimes against humanity committed for 27 years while he was at the helm of the Romanian Securitate,\u201d he wrote.\n\nPacepa is the co-author with Prof. Ronald Rychlak of \u201cDisinformation: Former Spy Chief Reveals Secret Strategy for Undermining Freedom, Attacking Religion and Promoting Terrorism\u201d and a companion documentary, both published by WND Books this year. His first book, \u201cRed Horizons,\u201d published in 1987, is credited with helping bring about the overthrow and execution of Ceausescu.\n\nPacepa has been accused of involvement in crimes by Ceausescu that he publicly exposed and some that he prevented from happening.\n\n\u201cWe knew we had put together a powerful book,\u201d Pacepa said of \u201cDisinformation,\u201d \u201cbut we did not suspect it to be so devastating for the Kremlin and for the Romanian communists that they would go to any length, including the physical liquidation of its main author.\u201d\n\nRomania\u2019s decision to commend him \u201cgave those communists a terrible blow,\u201d he said.\n\nThe letter from Romania was signed by Andrei Muraru, executive president of the Romanian Institute for the Investigation of the Crimes of Communism and for the Remembrance of the Romanian Diaspora, which is directly responsible to the prime minister.\n\nIt acknowledged Pacepa played \u201ca major role in unmasking the criminal nature of the communist dictatorship in Romania, and especially the illegal and despotic role of the political police of the totalitarian regime.\u201d\n\n\u201cRed Horizons,\u201d published in 1987 while Ceausescu was still at the height of power, notes that the first things Pacepa reported to the U.S. government after defecting in 1978 were Ceausescu\u2019s orders to assassinate two Radio Free Europe employees (Noel Bernard and Emil Georgescu), two of his main political critics in the West (Paul Goma and Virgil Tanase) and three major Securitate, or secret police, defectors (Constantin Dumitr\u0103chescu, Ion Iacobescu and Constantin R\u0103u\u0163\u0103).\n\nSome of Pacepa\u2019s revelations were republished in 2009 in the book \u201cCold War Radio: The Dangerous History of American Broadcasting in Europe,\u201d by Richard H. Cummings, former director of Radio Free Europe, and in 2010 in \u201cCold War Broadcasting: Impact on the Soviet Union and Easter Europe,\u201d edited by A. Ross Johnson and R. Eugene Parta.\n\nPacepa\u2019s revelations prevented the planned assassinations, and the designated killer of R\u0103u\u0163\u0103, whose identity was revealed by Pacepa, was arrested by the FBI and committed suicide.\n\nHit squads\n\nThe Romanian letter to Pacepa was issued two weeks after a national television channel in the country declared July 28, 2013, to be \u201cPacepa Day,\u201d commemorating 35 years since the spy chief\u2019s defection to the U.S. The station organized an unprecedented, six-hour prime-time program to celebrate the event, as WND reported.\n\nBut Romanian communists have persuaded the country\u2019s justice system to condemn as \u201ctraitors\u201d all Romanians who broke with communism when it was in power and helped the U.S. win the Cold War.\n\nOn Aug. 17, 1978, just a month after Pacepa defected, the Ceausescu regime served two death sentences on him. Two days later, the dictator created an investigative team charged to name the purported crimes committed by Pacepa. In 1980, Gen. Emil Macri, who headed the team, charged that Pacepa sabotaged Ceausescu\u2019s orders to assassinate \u201cenemies\u201d and \u201cdefectors\u201d in the West. The report was never released by Ceausescu, and a few years later, Macri died in a suspect helicopter accident. In 1996, the report was published in \u201cThe White Book of the Securitate,\u201d a four-volume collection of Securitate documents issued by the new Romanian Intelligence Service, the SRI.\n\nIn \u201cRed Horizons,\u201d Pacepa reported Ceausescu\u2019s joint operation with Yugoslavian leader Marshal Josip Broz Tito to kidnap Wladimir Dapcevic, a Belgian citizen of Yugoslavian origin. The operation ended with Dapcevic being accidentally killed by the Securitate\u2019s Anti-Terrorist Unit, which was not subordinated to Pacepa\u2019s DIE. Pacepa says he revealed the super-secret Tito-Ceausescu plan \u2013 which in the 1980s was known to only a handful of people in Romania and Yugoslavia \u2013 because he wanted to expose the criminality of communist tyrants to the world.\n\nCeausescu created a special Securitate unit, U.M. 0195, staffed with about 1,000 officers and given the single task of assassinating Pacepa in the United States.\n\nAlthough the assassination squads never found Pacepa, he remains under deep cover because of ongoing threats.\n\nAs late as 2004, Romania still had arrest warrants for Pacepa at its borders. To this day, his personal property has not been returned to him. And, despite the lifting of the death sentence, some elements of the Romanian government still threaten his life.\n\nSome long for dictator\u2019s return\n\nThe new book by Pacepa and Rychlak shows how Ceausescu engaged in a long-term disinformation campaign to present himself to the West as an anti-Soviet leader with whom it could do business. In a visit to the White House in 1978, President Jimmy Carter praised Ceausescu as a \u201cgreat national and international leader.\u201d\n\nRychlak, a professor of law at the University of Mississippi, told WND that Pacepa \u201cdid indeed work for an evil man who might, if he were still around, legitimately face prosecution in the ICC: Nicolae Ceau\u0219escu.\u201d\n\n\u201cPacepa, however, risked his life to break with that regime and let the West know the truth,\u201d Rychlak said.\n\nRychlak noted Pacepa convinced President Reagan to change course on Romania, \u201cand he was a hero to the movement inside Romania that convicted Ceausescu of genocide.\u201d\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, as some Germans longed for a return of Hitler\u2019s regime, some Romanians long for a return to the Ceausescu era. These are the people behind the ridiculous claims being made against Pacepa,\u201d he said.\n\nRychlak pointed out that he has worked with, written about and even taught a course on the International Criminal Court.\n\n\u201cAnyone who says Pacepa should face prosecution not only disregards the historical truth of what happened in Romania but also misuses this international judicial structure,\u201d he said. \u201cThe ICC is designed to elevate the rule of law over politics.\u201d\n\nRychlak said the political activists who continue to bring such charges \u201cundercut the very purpose of the court and impede the promise of international justice.\u201d\n\nRychlak noted that at The Hague, Pacepa would be in good company. In 2011, a leftist religious group filed a petition with the ICC accusing Pope Benedict XVI of \u201ccrimes against humanity.\u201d The request for prosecution was among more than 9,000 that have been rejected. The ICC has opened investigations into only eight cases \u2013 all of African genocide.\n\n\u2018We\u2019ll have Polonium for you\u2019\n\nAs Pacepa contemplated the attempt to prosecute him before the U.N. court, he recalled the cautionary tale of defector Alexander Litvinenko of the Russian Federal Security Service, the FSB, the successor to the communist KGB.\n\nIn 2005, Litvinenko revealed that al-Qaida leader Ayman al-Zawahiri was trained by the FSB in Dagestan, Russia, and sent to Afghanistan to infiltrate al-Qaida and take over its leadership.\n\nThe revelation was so devastating for the Kremlin that the FSB killed Litvinenko in London with Polonium-210.\n\n\u201cThe Western world remained quiet, and al-Zawahiri became the leader of al-Qaida,\u201d Pacepa said.\n\nHe said the U.S., in its war against Islamic supremacists, still is threatened by the \u201cscience\u201d of disinformation.\n\n\u201cThe disinformation machinery is now doing its best to prevent the West from getting any other Pacepas \u2013 top-ranking sources who can tell the West things that not even the most sophisticated CIA satellites can: what terrorist despots have in mind, and what their most secret plans against us are,\u201d he said.\n\nPacepa said the message to potential defectors is: \u201cIf you defect, you\u2019ll end up at the International Criminal Court of Justice; if the Court does not indict you, we\u2019ll have Polonium for you, as we now know where you are.\u201d\n\n\u2018Objective eyes\u2019\n\nIn the past five years, 6,284 people sentenced by Romania\u2019s communist justice system for assisting the U.S. in the defeat of the Soviet empire have asked to have their sentences canceled, Pacepa points out.\n\nOnly three have succeeded, however, and that was because of media pressure.\n\nIn 2009, for example, Romania\u2019s Supreme Court declined for the third time to cancel a death sentence given by Ceausescu to Constantin Rauta for defecting to the U.S. Pacepa, points out that Romania will soon be protected by a ground-based ballistic missile defense system Rauta, now a reputable aerospace engineer, helped develop.\n\n\u201cIt is now the time for Romania to look back on communism\u2019s crimes with objective eyes,\u201d Pacepa said.\n\nBut he acknowledged that \u201ccondemning the heresies of the past and rehabilitating its victims seems to be the most difficult step in the transition from tyranny to democracy.\u201d\n\nHe noted it wasn\u2019t until 1998 that the German parliament adopted a law canceling the sentences given to Klaus von Stauffenberg, who had led a plot to assassinate Hitler, and other Germans who helped the Allies defeat Nazism.\n\nGermany needed half a century to condemn Nazism completely, because that heresy was born in Germany and was rooted in her soil, Pacepa said.\n\nCommunism and its political police were not born in Romania, he argued, but were \u201cimported from the Soviet Union, and Romania should not wait for new generations to repudiate them.\u201d\n\nPacepa said Muraru, the author of the letter commending Pacepa, should be acknowledged for \u201chis determination to persuade this generation of Romanians to honor their fellow citizens who helped Romania fight communism.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is an enormous task,\u201d he said. \u201cWe wish him success.\u201d\n\nOrder \u201cDisinformation: Former Spy Chief Reveals Secret Strategy for Undermining Freedom, Attacking Religion and Promoting Terrorism\u201d or the companion film, \u201cDisinformation: The Secret Strategy To Destroy The West.\u201d Get both the book and DVD together \u2013 at a very special reduced price.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Free Press For A Free People Since 1997", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.1", "og": {"site_name": "WND", "description": "Just as the former Soviet bloc\u2019s highest-ranking defector is being officially commended by the government of his native land for aiding the downfall of communism in the region, defenders of the old regime are threatening to bring him before the International Criminal Court of Justice in The Hague on crimes against humanity.
