That\u2019s compared to potential savings of $173 million over 10 years if Idaho expanded its Medicaid program and accepted federal funds to cover the vast majority of the costs, but Idaho lawmakers leery of Obamacare have been unwilling to go that route thus far.\n\nThe state-funded plan, outlined by Statesman reporter Bill Dentzer in a Sunday story here, would be free both from federal strings and any federal aid. It would cover basic preventive health care for people in the state\u2019s coverage gap \u2013 those who earn too much to qualify for Medicaid, but not enough to qualify for subsidized health insurance plans through the state\u2019s YourHealthIdaho.org insurance exchange.\n\nEmergency room visits, acute care, hospitalizations and prescriptions would not be covered, Dentzer reports, and the state would continue its existing reliance on county indigent funds and the state catastrophic fund to pay for crisis care.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s an excellent first step. I think it\u2019s an Idaho solution,\u201d Rep. Fred Wood, R-Burley, a retired physician, told the Statesman. \u201cI don\u2019t view this necessarily as a substitute for (Medicaid expansion). I view it as now Idaho is making an attempt to take care of the indigent population for which we have an obligation, and we\u2019re doing it with a solution that we think that we can afford.\u201d\n\nPossible funding could come through higher tobacco taxes, Dentzer reports; Idaho\u2019s cigarette tax of 57 cents per pack is among the lowest in the nation. You can read his full report here.\n\nMeanwhile, William Moran, head of an initiative drive that\u2019s seeking to raise Idaho\u2019s cigarette tax to lower state college and university tuition, sent out a guest opinion to Idaho newspapers saying the state can do both: Enact the Otter Administration\u2019s health coverage proposal, and pass the \u201cCollege, Not Cancer\u201d initiative. Moran writes that Otter\u2019s plan would reportedly double the state\u2019s cigarette tax to raise $20 million a year for the health initiative; the initiative he\u2019s helping champion would raise it $1.50 per pack to lower college tuition; you can read his article here.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Otter Administration is proposing a state-funded partial alternative to Medicaid expansion that could deliver basic primary care for 78,000 Idahoans who now have little or no access to health care coverage, Idaho Statesman reporter Bill Dentzer reported over the weekend, at a cost to...", "og": {"site_name": "Spokesman.com", "description": "The Otter Administration is proposing a state-funded partial alternative to Medicaid expansion that could deliver basic primary care for 78,000 Idahoans who now have little or no access to health care coverage, Idaho Statesman reporter Bill Dentzer reported over the weekend, at a cost to...", "title": "Otter Administration floats plan to address health coverage gap without expanding Medicaid", "url": "http://www.spokesman.com/blogs/boise/2015/dec/07/otter-administration-floats-plan-address-health-coverage-gap-without-expanding-medicaid/", "image": "https://media.spokesman.com/img/logos/sr200.png", "updated_time": "2015-12-07T16:46:02.261559", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@SpokesmanReview", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "index, follow", "fb": {"app_id": 316254480466}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes", "googlebot": "index, follow"}, "article_summary": "It would cover basic preventive health care for people in the state\u2019s coverage gap \u2013 those who earn too much to qualify for Medicaid, but not enough to qualify for subsidized health insurance plans through the state\u2019s YourHealthIdaho.org insurance exchange.\nMoran writes that Otter\u2019s plan would reportedly double the state\u2019s cigarette tax to raise $20 million a year for the health initiative; the initiative he\u2019s helping champion would raise it $1.50 per pack to lower college tuition; you can read his article here.\nThe state-funded plan, outlined by Statesman reporter Bill Dentzer in a Sunday story here, would be free both from federal strings and any federal aid.\nI think it\u2019s an Idaho solution,\u201d Rep.
