The Denver Post debate between U.S. Senate candidate Mark Udall, the Democratic incumbent, and Rep. Cory Gardner, his Republican challenger, took place on Oct. 7, 2014, in the Denver Post Auditorium. Below are clips of each candidate’s responses to each question. All video by Eric Lutzens, Hyoung Chang, Lindsay Pierce and Mahala Gaylord of The Denver Post. To improve load time, we’ve put three videos on each of eight pages.

Mr. Gardner: You’ve been accused of waging an eight-year battle to outlaw birth control. Please explain where you stand on birth control, including your positions on the IUD and the morning-after pill.

Mr. Udall: We know you support a woman’s right to choose. But given the advances in the scientific understanding of fetal development, where pregnant mothers know at which week their babies grow fingernails and can swallow, would you support a ban on late-term abortions? And if so, at what week?

Separate questions for both candidates regarding the Affordable Care Act.

Mr. Udall, you’re up first. In your first Senate debate in 2008 when you were asked about health-care reform, you said, “I’m not for a government run-solution.” You voted for the Affordable Care Act, which has expanded the government’s Medicaid coverage for millions of low-income Americans. How is this not a government-run solution?
