I\u2019ve got a pen . . . and I can use that pen to sign executive orders and take executive actions,\u201d he asserted. \u201cOne of the things that I\u2019m going to be talking to my Cabinet about is how do we use all the tools available to us.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s already made good on his promise to act unilaterally \u2014 delaying the ObamaCare mandate on businesses again last week and changing the rules for immigration enforcement.\n\nBut what Obama didn\u2019t say is that, behind the scenes, he\u2019s radically increasing the government\u2019s reach. His tools aren\u2019t laws or even executive orders \u2014 it\u2019s thousands of new pages of new rules in the Federal Register, the nation\u2019s official book of regulations, controlling everything from home finance to car deals to city zoning.\n\nAn unelected, unappointed shadowy network of leftie advocates are rewriting these rules \u2014 posing a direct threat to Congress\u2019 legislative authority. Yet alarmingly few lawmakers are aware of its clout. Likewise, few in the private sector know about its unchecked power and influence over business and finance \u2014 or even local housing and school policies.\n\nSchools can\u2019t suspend bullies\n\nOne troubling new area of regulation: rules for discipline at your children\u2019s schools, so that teachers can no longer kick students who misbehave out of the classroom. They\u2019re relaxing the protocols for punishing even violent kids, compounding fears about classroom safety in a post-Newtown world.\n\nNew school-discipline guidelines issued last month by Education Secretary Arne Duncan are based on a \u201cframework\u201d recently formulated by the New York-based Dignity in Schools Campaign.\n\nFollowing Dignity\u2019s recommendations, the administration is pressuring schools to keep disruptive minority students in the classroom. The new federal guidelines call for a moratorium on suspensions, now demonized as \u201cracist\u201d because they have a \u201cdisparate impact\u201d on black students. They also discourage school authorities from bringing police onto campuses even in some violent cases.\n\n\u201cRacial discrimination in school discipline is a real problem today,\u201d Duncan claimed in announcing the new policy. But chances are he outsourced this \u201csolution.\u201d\n\n\u201cI doubt he had anything to do with the actual drafting of these guidelines,\u201d said former Education Department official Hans Bader, maintaining he gave the job to \u201cleft-wing radicals.\u201d\n\nIndeed, Duncan\u2019s guidelines adopt Dignity\u2019s recommendation that schools enroll troubled kids in \u201crestorative circles\u201d and other culturally sensitive programs instead of suspending them.\n\nUnder this \u201cpositive approach,\u201d offenders are allowed to negotiate the consequences for their bad behavior, which usually involves anger-management counseling and \u201cdialogue sessions,\u201d in which teachers join unruly students in \u201ctalking circles\u201d to foster greater \u201ccultural understanding.\u201d Talk invariably turns to racism and \u201cwhite bias.\u201d\n\nDignity says the powwows \u201ccombat bias that contributes to disproportionate discipline.\u201d\n\nOf course, they also provide rowdy minorities an excuse for continued bad behavior.\n\nNew York City public schools recently adopted \u201crestorative counseling\u201d as an alternative to suspensions, now banned as a punishment for one-time minor infractions.\n\n\u201cTaking a restorative approach to discipline changes the fundamental questions that are asked when a behavioral incident occurs,\u201d the department\u2019s new discipline code states. Instead of asking who\u2019s to blame and how they should be punished, it addresses \u201cunderlying factors\u201d that lead youth to act out.\n\nThe administration is tying school funding to compliance with its discipline guidelines, while at the same time threatening discrimination lawsuits.\n\nBut relaxed discipline policies threaten to undo the benefits of zero tolerance policies started in 2004. Under the Impact School initiative, New York schools partnered with the NYPD to crack down on campus crime, resulting in a 55% plunge in violent school incidents, according to city data.\n\nForced integration of the suburbs\n\nThe fingerprints of radical social engineers are all over housing policy as well.\n\nAffordable-housing zealots helped craft a sweeping new federal regulation that created a controversial \u201chousing-discrimination database,\u201d which the administration hopes to use to reshape the demographics of every neighborhood in America.\n\nIt\u2019s part of an ambitious agenda to eliminate \u201cracial segregation,\u201d ZIP code-by-ZIP code, through the systematic dismantling of \u201cexclusionary\u201d building ordinances across America.\n\nIt\u2019s started here in New York\u2019s Westchester County, where HUD is withholding millions of dollars in funding until the area relaxes restrictions on subsidized housing.\n\nBut that\u2019s just the beginning of a nationwide campaign to force suburbs to accept Section 8 and other low-income residents.\n\n\u201cThe battle for zoning in Westchester County [will be] the battle everywhere,\u201d warned Westchester County Executive Rob Astorino. \u201cThis is about changing every block, every neighborhood to the viewpoint of federal bureaucrats at HUD.\u201d\n\nThe agency\u2019s 34-page \u201cAffirmatively Furthering Fair Housing\u201d mandate, soon to be codified as law in the Federal Register, is the brainchild of the National Fair Housing Alliance, a radical leftist group based in Washington.\n\nNFHA helped draft the legal and technical language in the regulation, and coached other activists to propose ways to strengthen the rule in public comments solicited by HUD. NFHA even prepared letter-writing templates using the same language for other activist groups.\n\nNFHA worked closely with Sara K. Pratt, HUD\u2019s chief of fair-housing enforcement. HUD officially lists NFHA, which happens to be Pratt\u2019s old shop, as a \u201cpartner.\u201d The two recently announced a joint media campaign \u201cto fight housing discrimination,\u201d for which Pratt\u2019s office awarded NFHA more than $2 million in grants. Pratt worked several years for NFHA as a director, trainer and consultant.\n\n\u201cHUD uses a network of crony advocates to help create, improve and finalize new rules,\u201d said Cornelia Mrose, a housing analyst who recently prepared a study examining the development of HUD\u2019s suburban integration rule for the American Enterprise Institute, a free-market think tank in Washington. \u201cAnd it uses this same network of crony advocates to execute and enforce rules.\u201d\n\nNFHA conducts discrimination investigations for HUD using \u201ctesters\u201d to pose as renters and homebuyers in minority communities across the country.\n\nAdded Mrose, \u201cThere\u2019s no division of power here \u2014 it\u2019s all rolled into one.\u201d\n\nShe warns the close collaboration between activists and federal agencies within the Obama administration has \u201ccorrupted\u201d the otherwise public rules-making process and created a powerful \u201ccrony advocacy empire\u201d impervious to influence from average citizens.\n\nWhile citizen opposition was passionate \u2014 decrying the regulation as \u201cforced integration\u201d and \u201caffirmative action on a ZIP code level,\u201d while warning of Section 8 housing crime and lower property values \u2014 HUD disregarded them as \u201clow-quality comments.\u201d\n\nRecreating the mortgage crisis\n\nAs if that weren\u2019t enough, Obama\u2019s new credit cop, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, is out to recreate the conditions that caused the 2008 mortgage collapse by pressuring banks to make loans to people who can\u2019t afford them in the name of racial \u201cfairness.\u201d And it\u2019s happening behind closed doors.\n\nCFPB won\u2019t let private citizens or reporters into meetings with its 25 paid advisers, the Consumer Advisory Board, whose taxpayer-compensated members include trial lawyers who make a living suing banks, former ACORN activists, and even a member of the Democratic National Committee. Some have taken hundreds of thousands of dollars in federal grant money to ferret out discrimination in housing and lending.\n\n\u201cThey want input from liberal activists and Democratic partisans without public scrutiny,\u201d said Competitive Enterprise Institute official John Berlau, who last year represented a Mississippi businessman barred from a Consumer Advisory Board meeting in what Berlau says was a \u201cclear violation\u201d of the Federal Advisory Committee Act.\n\nOne influential CFPB adviser, Ellen Seidman, happens to be one of the architects of the disastrous housing policies that caused the mortgage crisis. Seidman encouraged subprime lending in \u201cunderserved\u201d communities as a top Clinton bank regulator enforcing the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA). \u201cGrowth in the subprime credit market indicates that credit needs in many low- and moderate-income areas are being met,\u201d she said in 1999. She also cheered the relaxation of credit standards and the development of the subprime securities market.\n\n\u201cWithout CRA as an impetus,\u201d Seidman said, \u201cthis market would likely not have developed.\u201d\n\nNow Seidman is helping rewrite the rules for home lending. CFPB recently released new mortgage rules that, despite claims of tightening standards, require no minimum credit scores or down payments and even count payments from \u201cgovernment assistance programs\u201d as qualifying income for low-income borrowers.\n\nRadical advisers also have opened up a new \u201cfair lending\u201d front \u2014 car loans.\n\nCFPB has sued the nation\u2019s largest car lender, Ally Bank, for $100 million over discrimination charges.\n\nAlly denies the allegations, arguing it prices for risk, not race. Indeed, the administration failed to take credit scores and other key risk factors into account in its investigation \u2014 just as it failed to take them into account shaking down almost three dozen mortgage lenders \u2014 including Bank of America and Wells Fargo \u2014 for a combined $810 million over alleged lending discrimination.\n\nDiscriminating against minority borrowers would be a deplorable crime if true. But investigators have no direct evidence it\u2019s occurring. Cases are based exclusively on statistics showing \u201cdisparities\u201d in loan outcomes by race. For the first time, federal civil-rights enforcers are relying on stats, rather than actual acts or intent, to prove racism.\n\nThey assume \u201cstatistically significant\u201d disparities in loan rates between whites and minorities proves lenders are discriminating against minorities. But there\u2019s a fundamental flaw: They\u2019re not comparing whites and minorities with the same credit backgrounds.\n\nThey\u2019re missing their credit scores, debt-to-income ratios and other key information that influences lending decisions (like down payments and trade-ins) in their computer screens. In short, they\u2019re making reckless allegations.\n\nThough investigators argue crunching the raw data is sufficient to prove racism if it shows \u201csignificant\u201d racial gaps in loan pricing, they won\u2019t define \u201csignificant\u201d \u2014 despite repeated bipartisan requests by Congress.\n\nCritics complain even the dubious statistical threshold they\u2019re using to trigger discrimination investigations is arbitrary and capricious.\n\n\u201cCFPB refuses to release any sort of analysis or methodology as to how they reached their conclusions,\u201d National Auto Dealers Association spokesman Baily Wood said.\n\n\u2018Working the system\u2019\n\nIn the 1970s, Saul Alinsky, the Chicago socialist, father of community organizing and Obama idol, wrote \u201cRules for Radicals\u201d as a training manual for stealth \u201crevolution.\u201d He advised activists to cut their hair and clean up their mouths so they could \u201cwork in the system\u201d and change it from the \u201cinside.\u201d\n\nOnly by operating inside the establishment, he said, could this new \u201cvanguard\u201d of leftists really hope to redistribute power and wealth \u201cfrom the Haves to the Have-Nots.\u201d\n\nThe strategy has worked beyond his wildest dreams.\n\nIt took a few decades, but Alinsky\u2019s coat-and-tie radicals are fully deployed inside the power corridors of Washington \u2014 including, of course, the West Wing, where Alinsky\u2019s star pupil controls the show. And they\u2019re collaborating with the most militant elements of the nonprofit sector.\n\nTogether, both the washed and unwashed of Alinsky\u2019s \u201cRules for Radicals\u201d gang are now writing the rules regulating industry and society.\n\nPaul Sperry is a Hoover Institution media fellow and author of \u201cThe Great American Bank Robbery.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "New York Post", "twitter": {"description": "Last month, President Obama declared he\u2019ll \u201cact on my own,\u201d that he doesn\u2019t need Congress to exercise his power.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not just going to be waiting for legislation.
