These are the same people whose disaffection with the former dictator government ignited the uprising.\n\nAccording to Green and the International Republican Institute, which monitored the elections, only 46 percent of eligible youth voted in the parliamentary elections. That\u2019s less than in 2011, before the Arab Spring.\n\n\u201cYoung people did not vote,\u201d Green said. \u201cIn the land of the Arab Spring, that\u2019s a problem.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s also a problem because young people are undoubtedly a factor in the country\u2014and will be even more so in the future.\n\nThough the youth unemployment rate in the country is at 31 percent, 57 percent of the Tunisian population is college-educated.\n\nIn another sign of progress, there are more Tunisian women than men studying in universities.\n\nBut a better informed society doesn\u2019t necessarily lead to engagement.\n\n\u201cIt is not that young people are not politically active,\u201d Green said. \u201cIt may be that they don\u2019t see a connection to an opportunity to affect real change.\u201d\n\nGreen and fellow Tunisia experts Alexis Arieff, an analyst in African affairs at the Congressional Research Service, and Shantayanan Devarajan, the chief economist of Middle East and North Africa region at The World Bank, spoke at The Heritage Foundation Friday about the country\u2019s transition to democracy.\n\nTo truly reach democracy, the experts say, Tunisia will not only have to better connect to its youth, but it will also need to diversify a state-driven economy that had been known for \u201ccrony capitalism\u201d under Ben Ali.\n\nIt also must overcome security concerns. The Tunisian government reports that 2,400 of its people have traveled to Syria to fight with the Islamic State and other extremist groups since 2011.\n\nArieff perhaps best captured the challenge facing Tunisia.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a disconnect between international praise and internal anxiety,\u201d she said.\n\nWhile Tunisia\u2019s ultimate legacy will be shaped in the years to come, Green is confident to predict the future.\n\n\u201cTunisia\u2019s success will inspire other countries,\u201d he told The Daily Signal. \u201cOther countries will look and say, \u2018This is an example of a largely Muslim country which is now a largely Muslim democracy: growing, vibrant, tolerant, a voice of moderation.\u2019 One that is a significant and responsible part of the community of democracies.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Four years since Tunisia became known as the birthplace of the Arab Spring, the tiny North African country is fast becoming something else: a democracy.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Four years since Tunisia became known as the birthplace of the Arab Spring, the tiny North African country is fast becoming something else: a democracy.", "title": "\u2018We Need Inspirations All Over the World Right Now\u2019: Why This Small North African Country Might Be It", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150118_Tunisia.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-01-17T22:19:15+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1zoYxHk"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Four years since Tunisia became known as the birthplace of the Arab Spring, the tiny North African country is fast becoming something else: a democracy.", "title": "\u2018We Need Inspirations All Over the World Right Now\u2019: Why This Small North African Country Might Be It", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150118_Tunisia.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "International", "tag": "Africa", "published_time": "2015-01-18T03:01:54+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-01-17T22:19:15+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Tunisia, Arab Spring, Ambassador Mark Green, North Africa, International Republican Institute, Congressional Research Service, World Bank, democracy, The Economist"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc570\"", "article_summary": "\u201cWe need inspirations all over the world right now.\u201dSince Green\u2019s visit, Tunisia has gone on to have presidential elections in November and a runoff between presidential candidates in December.\nThat\u2019s less than in 2011, before the Arab Spring.\nFour years since Tunisia became known as the birthplace of the Arab Spring, the tiny North African country is fast becoming something else: a democracy.\nThough the youth unemployment rate in the country is at 31 percent, 57 percent of the Tunisian population is college-educated.\nWhile Tunisia\u2019s ultimate legacy will be shaped in the years to come, Green is confident to predict the future."}
