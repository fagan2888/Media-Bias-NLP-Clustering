The summary below highlights a number of today\u2019s important benefits issues and the related deadlines. Of special interest are the latest provisions to take effect under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and its companion law, the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (jointly, the \u201cAffordable Care Acts\u201d or \u201cACA\u201d).\n\nHealth Care Plans\n\nEmployer Mandate for Employers With 50 to 99 Employees Goes Into Effect\n\nOn January 1, 2016, the employer shared responsibility rules under the Affordable Care Acts, and applicable penalties, go into effect for employers with 50 to 99 full-time equivalent employees. (The rules went into effect on January 1, 2015 for employers with 100 or more full-timers.) Employers that are subject to the so-called \u201cemployer mandate\u201d must offer acceptable health coverage to at least 95% of their full-time employees.\n\nEmployers should be monitoring their employee headcount to determine whether they are subject to the mandate starting in 2016. If the rules apply, employers must ensure that they are offering essential health benefits coverage that provides at least \u201cminimum value,\u201d and that the cost of such health coverage does not exceed the statutory limit (generally, 9.5% of W-2 income).\n\nACA Reporting Obligations\n\nFor 2015, \u201capplicable large employers\u201d or \u201cALEs\u201d are required under the ACA to file information returns regarding employer-provided health insurance. Generally, an ALE is an employer that, during the year in question, had 50 or more full-time equivalent employees.\n\nIn addition, all employers providing self-insured health coverage \u2014 whether ALEs or not \u2014 must file information returns for 2015, giving information not only about employees, but about other covered individuals (spouses, dependents) as well.\n\nThe forms to be used depend on the employer\u2019s status:\n\nAn ALE, including a self-insured ALE, should file a Form 1095-C for each employee who was a full-time employee for any month of 2015. Form 1094-C (a transmittal form giving employer information) must accompany the Forms 1095-C.\n\nfor each employee who was a full-time employee for any month of 2015. Form 1094-C (a transmittal form giving employer information) must accompany the Forms 1095-C. A self-insured non-ALE should file Forms 1095-B with a simple transmittal form, Form 1094-B.\n\nThe Internal Revenue Service (IRS) will accept paper forms from non-ALEs and from ALEs filing less than 250 Forms 1095-C. An ALE filing 250 or more Forms 1095-C must file electronically. Paper filings are due by February 28, 2016 , while electronic filings are due by March 31, 2016 .\n\nImportant: Each employee must receive a copy of the Form 1095-B or 1095-C giving his/her individual information. In the case of an ALE, forms must be mailed to employees by January 31, 2016 , which is before the required IRS filing date.\n\nFees Due in January for ACA Reinsurance Program\n\nThe Affordable Care Acts require insurance issuers and self-funded group health plans to pay fees for 2014, 2015, and 2016 to fund the \u201cTransitional Reinsurance Program.\u201d Typically, insurers will remit the fees for fully insured plans.\n\nThis year, there is good news for some plans \u2014 self-funded plans are generally not required to pay the fees for 2015 and 2016.\n\nWhere required, the fee for 2015 is $3.67 per participant per month (or $44 per participant per year). The fee can be paid in one installment or two:\n\nIf paying in one installment, the 2015 fee is due January 15, 2016.\n\nIf paying in two installments, the first installment of $33 per participant is due January 1, 2016, and the second installment of $11 per participant is due November 15, 2016.\n\nFor additional details on how to pay the fee, click here .\n\nIncrease in Health FSA Limit\n\nUnder the ACA, a cafeteria plan was originally required to limit the amount that a participant could contribute to a health flexible spending arrangement to $2,500 per year (or less). Since the contribution limit has now risen to $2,550, cafeteria plans should be amended to incorporate the increased limit.\n\nTax-Qualified Retirement Plans\n\nDecember 1 Notice Deadline for Calendar-Year 401(k) Plans\n\nAdministrators of calendar-year 401(k) plans may need to issue the following year-end notices to plan participants by December 1, 2015:\n\nQDIA Notice . Where a 401(k) plan uses a qualified default investment alternative (\u201cQDIA\u201d) as the investment fund for participants who fail to make timely investment elections, the employer must provide an annual notice describing the QDIA and the rights of participants at least 30 days before the beginning of each plan year.\n\nAutomatic Enrollment Notice . Where a 401(k) plan contains automatic enrollment features, the employer must provide an annual notice explaining automatic enrollment and the right to opt out at least 30 days before the beginning of each plan year.\n\nSafe Harbor Notice . Where a 401(k) plan provides safe harbor contributions designed to automatically satisfy applicable nondiscrimination requirements, the employer must provide an annual notice explaining the safe harbor design at least 30 days before the beginning of each plan year.\n\nNews About Determination Letters\n\nPlan sponsors whose employer identification numbers end in -5 or -0 are in \u201cCycle E\u201d of the IRS\u2019s determination letter program. Cycle E plan sponsors must apply for new determination letters by January 31, 2016 . Each determination letter application must be accompanied by an amended and restated plan document.\n\nAfter Cycle E closes on January 31, 2016, plan sponsors will no longer be required to request new determination letters every five years. The IRS has announced that it is scaling back its determination letter program \u2014 effective January 1, 2017, it will issue determination letters only to new plans and terminating plans.\n\nThe scope of the determination letter program is changing, the IRS says, because the IRS needs to \u201cmore efficiently direct its limited resources.\u201d Going forward, the IRS intends to focus on different ways to help plan sponsors comply with the qualified plan document requirements.\n\nDiscretionary Plan Amendments\n\nAny plan sponsor that made discretionary changes to a tax-qualified retirement plan during the 2015 plan year must formally adopt a written plan amendment embodying the changes by the last day of the plan year \u2014 December 31, 2015 for calendar-year plans.\n\nFiduciary Duty to Review Plan Asset Performance\n\nSponsors of pension, 401(k), and 403(b) plans have a fiduciary duty to monitor the investment performance of plan assets. Many observers suggest that it is appropriate for investment performance reviews to take place on a quarterly basis. It is generally acknowledged that a plan sponsor is well served by hiring a qualified investment advisor to help with reviews.\n\nEven in the case of a 401(k) or 403(b) plan that provides for participant-directed investments, investment performance reviews are required, because the suitability of the investment choices available to plan participants must be assessed periodically. Such fiduciary concerns also apply to investment of plan assets under a nonqualified deferred compensation plan.\n\nAs the calendar year comes to a close, plan sponsors should begin to focus on a year-end review early in the first quarter of next year. And, to the extent that a plan sponsor has not implemented a periodic review process, strong consideration should be given to developing appropriate plan administrative procedures. At a minimum, such procedures would deal with engaging a qualified investment advisor, developing and drafting investment policy statements for each plan, setting periodic review dates, and creating a process by which all these actions are memorialized.\n\nDefined Contribution Plans Must Allocate Forfeitures by Year-End\n\nIn general, qualified defined contribution plans may not carry unallocated suspense accounts from one plan year to the next. The IRS makes specific exceptions to this rule for suspense accounts arising from (a) the correction of excess annual additions and (b) assets transferred from a terminated defined benefit plan to be allocated over a seven-year period. Otherwise, the IRS expects all plan assets to be allocated among participant accounts at year-end.\n\nGenerally, whether a defined contribution plan reallocates forfeitures, applies them as a credit toward employer contributions, or applies them as a credit toward plan expenses, there should be no unallocated forfeitures remaining at year-end. Plan documents may contain language specifically addressing when forfeitures must be applied.\n\nBenefit Limits for 2016\n\nMost benefit limits affecting tax-qualified retirement plans remain unchanged for 2016. However, sponsors of defined benefit plans will experience an increase in PBGC premiums. The limits for 2016 are shown below:\n\nAnnual Benefit Plan Limits\n\nClick here to view the table.\n\nReminder: Summary Plan Descriptions\n\nAn updated summary plan description (SPD) must be furnished every five years if changes have been made to information in the SPD, or if the related plan has been updated during that time period. (Otherwise, a new SPD must be furnished every 10 years.) In the interval between updated SPDs, plan participants must receive a summary of any \u201cmaterial modifications\u201d to their plan no later than 210 days after the end of the plan year in which the modifications were adopted.\n\nImmigration News\n\nH-1B Visa Lottery Certain for April 1, 2016\n\nEach year, U.S. employers scramble to obtain H-1B visas for the foreign national professionals they employ. In the past three years, the demand for new H-1B visas has exceeded availability on the first day of filing, April 1. Only 85,000 H-1B visas become available each year, and in 2015 the number of new H-1B petitions filed exceeded 230,000.\n\nAs the 2016 filing season approaches, employers should assume, once again, that there will be more demand for H-1B visas than there are numbers available.\n\nThe earliest filing date for the next allotment of H-1B visas is April 1, 2016. If \u2014 as is certain \u2014 more H-1B petitions are filed than there are numbers available, the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services will subject all petitions submitted on the first day to a random selection to determine which will be processed. The H-1B petitions not selected in this lottery will be returned to the employers who filed them, and the affected workers will be unable to seek H-1B status for another year.\n\nGiven the importance of getting new H-1B petitions filed on the first day of the 2016 filing season, we advise employers to work with counsel to have the petitions prepared well before the end of March, 2016. There is no guarantee that any particular petition will be selected in the H-1B visa lottery, but unless the petition is filed on April 1, 2016, it will stand no chance of acceptance.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=c27efa0c-4dca-4482-b931-766d8db84492", "image": "http://www.lexology.com/images/share/lexology-facebook.png", "description": "2015 comes to a close, plan sponsors may wish to review their employee benefit plans and programs and consider various new rules that take effect in\u2026", "title": "2015 year-end employee benefits round-up | Lexology"}, "Description": "2015 comes to a close, plan sponsors may wish to review their employee benefit plans and programs and consider various new rules that take effect in\u2026", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Form 1094-C (a transmittal form giving employer information) must accompany the Forms 1095-C.for each employee who was a full-time employee for any month of 2015.\nAfter Cycle E closes on January 31, 2016, plan sponsors will no longer be required to request new determination letters every five years.\nThis year, there is good news for some plans \u2014 self-funded plans are generally not required to pay the fees for 2015 and 2016.\nACA Reporting ObligationsFor 2015, \u201capplicable large employers\u201d or \u201cALEs\u201d are required under the ACA to file information returns regarding employer-provided health insurance.\n(The rules went into effect on January 1, 2015 for employers with 100 or more full-timers.)"}
