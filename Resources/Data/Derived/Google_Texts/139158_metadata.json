Cory Booker today addressed the killings in Newark for the first time since leaving City Hall in October.\n\n\"It\u2019s grievous,\" he said at an event in Edison, where he attended the swearing-in of Mayor Thomas Lankey. \"Any time you have over 100 people murdered in Newark, it should capture the focus of everyone who represents it.\"\n\nBooker oversaw steep reductions in crime during his first years in office, but Newark\u2019s homicide rate has been moving upward through 2013, when the city recorded 111 murders, the most in 23 years.\n\nBooker said he\u2019s looking at several programs to overhaul the U.S. criminal justice system and end the war on drugs, which he said fuels much of the violence.\n\n\"I can say as a mayor who has been fighting on the front lines for years, the drug war is an abject failure,\" Booker said. \"It\u2019s consumed egregious amounts of taxpayers\u2019 dollars. It hasn\u2019t achieved the public-safety aims of our streets, it\u2019s consumed human potential, it is a massive government overreach.\"\n\nHe said the real answer to fighting crime is addressing poverty and poor education.\n\n\"All of these things are things we should be working collaboratively on,\" Booker said.\n\nIn the meantime, Newark\u2019s leaders say the city can\u2019t wait.\n\n\"Nobody would argue with the need for a holistic approach over the long term, but our citizens need help right now,\" said North Ward Councilman and mayoral candidate Anibal Ramos. \"I requested federal emergency funding (to) bolster the ranks of the police department immediately and pay for increased overtime so we can flood high crime areas with more police.\"\n\nBooker would not comment on whether those dollars would be available but said he has been talking with U.S. Attorney Paul Fishman about immediate strategies.\n\nHe also said the violence was not confined to Newark.\n\nThe Star-Ledger reported today that New Jersey has seen a seven-year high in homicides statewide.\n\n\"Looking at the whole state, we have serious, serious violence issues,\" Booker said.\n\nStill, for Newarkers crime is the most important issue. While the city has seen drops in nonfatal shootings and overall crime in 2013, the shooting deaths have created a perception of fear and increasing hopelessness.\n\n\"There was a time when you could scare kids with jail or death,\" said South Ward Councilman and mayoral candidate Ras Baraka, \"That stuff doesn\u2019t work anymore.\"\n\nBaraka has long advocated for the kind of holistic approach that Booker discussed today. He said to change attitudes on the street young people needed to be engaged through school, home, with music, even through the older gang members that many youths admire.\n\n\"A lot of the time, these kids are looking up to people who are causing the damage,\" Baraka said. \"We\u2019re going to have to pressure them to help us.\"\n\nCentral Ward Councilman and mayoral candidate Darrin Sharif said he wants the city\u2019s corporate and academic leaders to form a plan to address the youth violence.\n\n\"Sit down at a table and have a real serious discussion about the massive investment we have to make,\" Sharif said. \"Even before that we have to have a Marshall Plan in reconstructing our neighborhoods.\"\n\nFormer state Assistant Attorney General Shavar Jeffries, who is also running for mayor, said Booker and the city council\u2019s decision to cut more than 160 police officers in 2010 was still wreaking havoc on city streets.\n\n\"The unfortunate fact is that Newark does not have the policing resources necessary to keep our residents safe,\" Jeffries said. \"When the city council decided to lay off 170 cops, it set the stage for what we\u2019re experiencing now, and there\u2019s no way around that.\"\n\nFOLLOW THE STAR-LEDGER: TWITTER \u2022 FACEBOOK \u2022 GOOGLE+\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "'@crime','@mobile','@newsletter-politics','@river','@starledger','cory-booker','essex-county','newark','newark-shootings'", "title": "Cory Booker addresses uptick in Newark violence at Edison event", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Cory Booker addresses uptick in Newark violence at Edison event\", \"link\": \"http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2014/01/cory_booker_addresses_uptick_in_newark_violence_at_edison_event.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://imgick.nj.com/home/njo-media/width620/img/star-ledger/photo/2014/01/14021354-standard.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"11915749\", \"pub_date\": \"2014-01-01T20:40:19Z\", \"author\": \"David Giambusso/The Star-Ledger\", \"tags\": [\"@crime\",\"@mobile\",\"@newsletter-politics\",\"@river\",\"@starledger\",\"cory-booker\",\"essex-county\",\"newark\",\"newark-shootings\"] }", "twitter": {"image": "http://media.nj.com/star-ledger/photo/2014/01/14021354-thumb_square_large.jpg", "creator": "@Giambusso", "site": "@njdotcom", "card": "summary", "description": "After overseeing dramatic reductions in crime during Booker's first years in office, Newark's homicide rate has been creeping slowly upward until 2013 when the city had 111 murders, more than any year than in the past 20 years"}, "article_date_updated": "Thursday, January 02, 2014, 12:23 PM", "parsely-metadata": "{\"image_url\": \"http://media.nj.com/star-ledger/photo/2014/01/-73e5bc6e5b53170d.jpg\", \"author_name\": \"dgiambus\", \"author_nickname\": \"David Giambusso/The Star-Ledger\", \"author_id\": \"5470\", \"source_blog_name\": \"New Jersey Real-Time News\", \"source_blog_url\": \"http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/\", \"sponsored_content\": \"0\" }", "og": {"site_name": "NJ.com", "description": "After overseeing dramatic reductions in crime during Booker's first years in office, Newark's homicide rate has been creeping slowly upward until 2013 when the city had 111 murders, more than any year than in the past 20 years", "title": "Cory Booker addresses uptick in Newark violence at Edison event", "url": "http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2014/01/cory_booker_addresses_uptick_in_newark_violence_at_edison_event.html", "image": "http://media.nj.com/design/alpha/img/logo_njo.gif", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "NJ.com", "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Wednesday, January 01, 2014,  3:39 PM", "article_author": "David Giambusso/The Star-Ledger", "Description": "After overseeing dramatic reductions in crime during Booker's first years in office, Newark's homicide rate has been creeping slowly upward until 2013 when the city had 111 murders, more than any year than in the past 20 years"}, "article_summary": "\"Looking at the whole state, we have serious, serious violence issues,\" Booker said.\nEDISON \u2014 As homicides surge in the city he governed for seven years, U.S. Sen.
