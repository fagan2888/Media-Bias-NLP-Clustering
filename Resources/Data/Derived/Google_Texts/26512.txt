In a rare TV interview with Greta Van Susteren on Tuesday, conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh argued the VA should outsource some — if not all — of its services to the private sector because the federal government is just not “equipped” to handle providing health care to the nation’s veterans.

He also said the unacceptable state of the VA provides a glimpse into where the United States’ health care system is heading with Obamacare.

“There have been problems with the VA that you can probably chronicle since the beginning of the VA, and the overriding problem is that this is something that government just can’t do,” he said.

Limbaugh accused the Obama administration of doing the exact same thing he accused doctors of while pitching Obamacare.

“One of the things that he accused doctors of doing was doing unnecessary surgeries to line their pockets… Look at what’s happened here, that’s the exact thing that happened,” he continued. “We had bureaucrats working at the VA who massaged waiting lists and ran people through waiting lists who had not been treated, all so they could receive a bonus.”
