Allen was doing relief work in Bethel Acres, the scene of a deadly tornado, and most recently in Guthrie, where wildfires destroyed homes.\n\n??\n\nA disaster relief organization helping tornado and wildfire victims across the state said money donated, more than $70,000 dollars is missing.\n\nAmerica\u2019s Disaster Relief fired Tonia Allen, the woman leading the charity\u2019s efforts in Oklahoma on Thursday. Allen was doing relief work in Bethel Acres, the scene of a deadly tornado, and most recently in Guthrie, where wildfires destroyed homes.\n\n\u201cWe suspected something was wrong,\u201d said Bethel Acres homeowner, Shirley Cox.\n\nMore than a year later, since tornados ripped through the Bethel Acres area, Cox and her family are still trying to get back in their home.\n\n\u201cI do think she had good intentions when all this started,\u201d said Cox.\n\nLast May, Cox and her husband signed a building contract with the now former State Director of America\u2019s Disaster Relief, but they had a feeling something wasn\u2019t right.\n\n\u201cWe were ready to get out of the contract when these churches stepped up and started helping us,\u201d said Cox.\n\nThe CEO of America\u2019s Disaster Relief, Jan France said she\u2019s been getting a lot of questions.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve gotten a lot of phone calls, texts, and emails from people telling me something is not right, and you need to check into this, and you need to check into that,\u201d said France.\n\nFrance said more than $70,000 dollars is unaccounted for in the organization's Oklahoma account. Funds were also transferred to the organization\u2019s Texas account. She said both accounts are now overdrawn, allegedly by Allen.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just been devastating. I can\u2019t tell you how much sleep I have lost,\u201d said France. \u201cThere have been nights; I haven\u2019t even gone to bed till 5:30, 6:00 in the morning.\u201d\n\nAllen raised red flags for the Guthrie Chamber of Commerce this past May. She wanted to help families there who lost their homes after the wildfire, and was quick to defend her reputation and the organization at that time.\n\n\u201cI think proof is more in your actions than your talk,\u201d said Allen, during an interview with News 9\u2019s Evan Anderson. \u201cCall the Attorney General\u2019s office, ask have we been investigated, check with the Secretary of State.\u201d\n\nNews 9 did some checking and learned America\u2019s Disaster Relief is a legally registered organization in the state, and there hadn\u2019t been any negative reports against it, until now. The organization earned a Gold Rating from GuideStar for their openness and disclosure.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s sad. It was so many people affected that need the help, and not just us,\u201d said Cox.\n\nAllen has until July 18th to hand over receipts, contracts, and other paperwork to the organization. France said she has yet to see any of those documentations.\n\nAllen is not facing any criminal charges right now. News 9 reached out to Allen for a comment, but her phone was no longer accepting calls.\n\nFrance said America\u2019s Disaster Relief is currently in \u201crecovery mode\u201d itself.\n\n?\n\n?", "article_metadata": {"wn-build": "XSLT-7.1-17", "Description": "A disaster relief organization helping tornado and wildfire victims across the state said money donated, more than $70,000 dollars is missing.", "og": {"url": "http://www.news9.com/story/26001402/americas-disaster-relief-says-former-state-director-mishandled-donation-money", "image": "http://KWTV.images.worldnow.com/images/4192204_G.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "A disaster relief organization helping tornado and wildfire victims across the state said money donated, more than $70,000 dollars is missing.", "title": "America's Disaster Relief Says Former State Director Mishandled Donation Money"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://KWTV.images.worldnow.com/images/4192204_G.jpg", "description": "A disaster relief organization helping tornado and wildfire victims across the state said money donated, more than $70,000 dollars is missing.", "card": "summary", "title": "America's Disaster Relief Says Former State Director Mishandled Donation Money"}, "wnreadableurl": "americas-disaster-relief-says-former-state-director-mishandled-donation-money", "ROBOTS": "index,follow,noarchive", "owner": "KWTV", "fb": {"app_id": 538140636230283}, "date": "2014/07/11", "KEYWORDS": "oklahoma city,okc,media,news,weather,tv,cbs,local,tornado,storm,oklahoma,newsok,channel 9,channel nine,news 9,television,this morning,live radar,kwtv,sports,video,live streaming,interactive", "wn-version": "ContainerE-Story", "wn-base": "IIS25", "verify-v1": "d5ZN+GNiazjgWlnr3WHikwraMvFljdUSLMgex4CGnc8=", "news_keywords": "oklahoma city,okc,media,news,weather,tv,cbs,local,tornado,storm,oklahoma,newsok,channel 9,channel nine,news 9,television,this morning,live radar,kwtv,sports,video,live streaming,interactive"}, "article_summary": "The CEO of America\u2019s Disaster Relief, Jan France said she\u2019s been getting a lot of questions.\nFrance said America\u2019s Disaster Relief is currently in \u201crecovery mode\u201d itself.\nAmerica\u2019s Disaster Relief fired Tonia Allen, the woman leading the charity\u2019s efforts in Oklahoma on Thursday.\nA disaster relief organization helping tornado and wildfire victims across the state said money donated, more than $70,000 dollars is missing.\nLast May, Cox and her husband signed a building contract with the now former State Director of America\u2019s Disaster Relief, but they had a feeling something wasn\u2019t right."}
