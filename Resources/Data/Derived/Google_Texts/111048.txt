Sunflower Community Action and Toys For Tots paired up to get 220 children presents for Christmas.

Carolina Hernandz of Sunflower Community Action says this is the fourth year for the toy drive.

"Every year we see an increase in families coming in here so we just continue to decide to do it," Hernandz said.

Many of the families that were targeted for gifts are in low income situations.

"It's a blessing," said Domina Johnson, "not having a job and I have to do what I have to do for my kids, so I try to get in all the organizations if I can."

Johnson says that the toy drive was a big benefit to her family, both for emotionally and financially. She says that if she was ever in the position to donate toys for needy families, she would.
