With public opinion titling increasingly against them (both on the issue of education itself and the U.S. Senate race that\u2019s turning, in some respects, into a referendum on the issue), these groups have been cranking out missive after missive in an attempt to prove that down is up.\n\nFortunately, the truth keeps shining through. Take for example, Ned Barnett\u2019s excellent essay in Sunday\u2019s edition of Raleigh\u2019s News & Observer. As Barnett patiently explains in the piece, the claims in recent political ads that spending state education spending has increased by \u201ca billion dollars\u201d doesn\u2019t hold water:\n\nThe $1 billion increase Wilburn refers to is deeply misleading. Most of that spending includes state contributions to pension and health funds and salary adjustments. It\u2019s not in any real world sense spending for the education of North Carolina\u2019s public school students. In the real world, spending for education is down. Wilburn could have learned that by going to the financial officer for her own school district. There has been a slight increase in special education funding, but the overall funding for the 5,400-student Yadkin County school district is down. Denise Bullin, the executive director of finance for Yadkin County schools, has been in the job for two years. In regard to state funding, she says, \u201cWe have experienced a reduction in both years.\u201d As for Wilburn\u2019s televised statements, Bullin said, \u201cI don\u2019t agree with that.\u201d The state\u2019s funding for Yadkin County schools fell from $30.8 million in 2012-13 to $28.3 million in 2013-14. In the same period, its per pupil funding dropped from $5,371 to $5,040.\n\nThe piece goes on to explain the statewide picture:\n\nCritics of the Republicans\u2019 education funding are not referring to contributions to the teachers retirement and health funds and salary adjustments. They are referring to how much is spent on what directly affects a student\u2019s school experience. That means how much is available for books, teacher assistants, support personnel such as nurses and counselors, and administrators and transportation. On this score Republican leaders of the General Assembly have failed not only to maintain funding but to keep up with inflation and the increase in students. For the mathematically challenged, here\u2019s how Philip Price, the chief financial officer for the state Department of Public Instruction, explained it in a post this week on DPI\u2019s website. The post lists public school funding since fiscal year 2008-09 (the last FY before the recession forced freezes and cuts): \u201cIf you back out the funding added for benefit cost increases and salary adjustments, the funding available for classroom activities (textbooks, transportation, teacher assistants, teachers, etc.) has been reduced by over $1 billion.\u201d He adds: \u201cTotal funding has remained essentially flat since 2008-09 despite an increase of 43,739 students. As a result, districts have had to accomplish more with less money per student.\u201d The bottom line: As moms, dads, teachers and students have seen with their own eyes these last few years, North Carolina has continued to under-invest in public education at a time when the economic recovery should have led to significant new investments to help repair the damage inflicted by the Great Recession. The political fallout of these shortsighted decisions may well be significant.
