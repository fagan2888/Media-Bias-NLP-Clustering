What kind of \u201ctruth\u201d do you think they want to speak?\n\nThe discussion was about why South Carolinian voters are \u201cmad as hell,\u201d as pollster Luntz put it, during a segment on last week\u2019s The Kelly File. And somehow, rather than discuss issues like income inequality, stagnant wages, high cost of health care or student debt, all we heard about was white racial grievance \u2013 of the sort that Fox would surely be squawking about if any black people spoke that way about whites.\n\nThe bigoted insinuations began immediately as one man complained that we pay as much for \u201crefugees and immigrants\u201d as we are paying for veterans\u2019 care.\n\nThere was a brief attack on ObamaCare as a woman claimed that health care \u201cis going straight down the toilet\u201d and \u201cWe can\u2019t convince doctors to treat patients.\u201d A man said he \u201cgot laid off because of ObamaCare and it\u2019s not fair.\u201d\n\nAnd then there was this guy: \u201cWhat bothers me the most in this country is that you can\u2019t even speak the truth any more or else you\u2019ll be called a racist or a bigot or any other thing.\u201d Got that? It doesn't just bother him, it bothers him more than anything else in this country.\n\nRather than challenge him, Luntz asked if others agreed. There was significant applause.\n\n\u201cSo, political correctness, does that bother you?\u201d Luntz asked, as if in agreement with his focus group member that there\u2019s something wrong in trying not to be racially offensive.\n\nA woman sitting next to the \u201ctruthteller\u201d \u2013 both in the front row \u2013 said, \u201cIt bothers me very much.\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause\u2026\u201d Luntz probed.\n\n\u201cBecause I have a right to my opinion without being labeled something. I mean, it\u2019s ridiculous,\u201d she said.\n\nSomebody else called it \u201creverse discrimination.\u201d\n\nThen there was this unfortunate or perhaps telling phrasing by a woman: \u201cAnyone who says anything has to watch everything they say and you can\u2019t label a spade a spade. Everyone is afraid to talk,\u201d she said.\n\nAnother woman said, \u201cWhat it really boils down for me is, the cultural change. I could have never imagined that in eight years of my country, I could have seen such a huge cultural change. \u2026It\u2019s an overwhelming umbrella of everything. It goes to how we treat our veterans, how we treat our older people, it\u2019s a culture change, how we\u2019re educating our children or not educating our children, how we have to treat one another.\"\n\nHmm, what could she mean about a \u201ccultural change\u201d in eight years?\n\nLater, several members said they want to impeach President Obama.\n\nNow, I have many times felt that I could not say what I really wanted to say. But it was never once because I thought somebody might think I\u2019m a racist.\n\nWatch the discussion below, from the January 15 The Kelly File, and I think it will be very clear what kind of \u201ctruth\u201d these people want to speak.", "article_metadata": {"csrf-param": "authenticity_token", "google-site-verification": "google51c0b549f514d464.html", "csrf-token": "VtFmx+K9zyxCZRqUFdZUwTel9yBSxwNyuKicKYEK7GQ=", "og": {"url": "http://www.newshounds.us/fox_news_focus_group_member_complains_you_can_t_speak_truth_you_ll_be_called_a_racist_011716", "site_name": "NewsHounds", "image": "http://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/newshounds/sites/1/meta_images/original/Newshound3_blue.png?1327001871", "type": "article", "title": "Fox News Focus Group Member Complains, \u2018You Can\u2019t Even Speak The Truth Any More Or Else You\u2019ll Be Called A Racist\u2019"}, "Title": "Fox News Focus Group Member Complains, \u2018You Can\u2019t Even Speak The Truth Any More Or Else You\u2019ll Be Called A Racist\u2019"}, "article_summary": "A Frank Luntz focus group thinks it\u2019s just so unfair that when they \u201cspeak the truth,\u201d people think they\u2019re racists.\nI could have never imagined that in eight years of my country, I could have seen such a huge cultural change.\nHmm, what could she mean about a \u201ccultural change\u201d in eight years?\nAnother woman said, \u201cWhat it really boils down for me is, the cultural change.\nWhat kind of \u201ctruth\u201d do you think they want to speak?"}
