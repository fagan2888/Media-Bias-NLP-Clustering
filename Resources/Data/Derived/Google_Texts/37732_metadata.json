The lowest-cost \u201csilver\u201d plan through the state exchange, called Connect for Health Colorado, costs $201 a month for a 27-year-old and $343 for a 50-year-old. Both were offered by Kaiser Permanente.\n\nPlans can vary in benefits offered and patient co-pays, but the lowest monthly premiums in the Denver market were offered by Kaiser Permanente and Humana. Rocky Mountain Health Plans offered rates about 25 percent higher than Kaiser\u2019s. Cigna and Access Health Colorado were even higher, the analysis found.\n\nFour carriers offer plans in the Grand Junction area. The lowest-priced ilver-plan premium costs $234 for a 27-year-old and $399 for a 50-year-old \u2014 offered by Rocky Mountain Health Plans. That carrier is extremely competitive in the Grand Junction area but less so throughout the state, the report said.\n\nSix carriers are active in a region that includes 18 rural counties in southeastern Colorado.\n\nColorado Choice, a health-maintenance organization centered in the San Luis Valley, has relatively low premiums in that market, according to the analysis.\n\nColorado Health OP, the state\u2019s consumer co-op, is fairly competitive in Denver but less so in Grand Junction, the Urban Institute said. The co-op has the lowest-cost silver plan in the rural rating area examined in the study, but rates in the San Luis Valley are still high \u2014 as they are in all small towns and rural areas with limited medical providers.\n\nInsurance carriers set rates based on what they assume about the population being covered, study authors John Holahan and Linda Blumber wrote. However, insurers offering their first exchange plans for 2014 didn\u2019t know the health status or claims history of enrollees. And, under the Affordable Care Act, every applicant must be charged the same as everyone else in their age group.\n\nMinimum benefits, too, are mandated.\n\nSo how much carriers charge is based on assumptions about how much the population will use insurance. And rates also are based on how carriers perceive ACA\u2019s regulations will effectively spread risk among plans, the report noted.\n\nAnother factor in setting rates is how much leverage carriers have over physicians and hospitals in setting prices.\n\nElecta Draper: 303-954-1276, edraper@denverpost.com or twitter.com/electadraper", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Colorado\u2019s health marketplace competitive, low-priced, study says", "title": "Colorado\u2019s health marketplace competitive, low-priced, study says", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/08/13/colorados-health-marketplace-competitive-low-priced-study-says/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140708__CD24HEALTHCARE_KO19027p1-4.jpg", "height": 467}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140708__CD24HEALTHCARE_KO19027p1-4.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-08-13T16:24:33+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T09:32:20+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Obamacare"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc361\"", "article_summary": "Rocky Mountain Health Plans offered rates about 25 percent higher than Kaiser\u2019s.\nThat carrier is extremely competitive in the Grand Junction area but less so throughout the state, the report said.\nThe lowest-priced ilver-plan premium costs $234 for a 27-year-old and $399 for a 50-year-old \u2014 offered by Rocky Mountain Health Plans.\nColorado\u2019s health insurance marketplace is \u201cvery competitive\u201d and offers relatively low premiums, especially in its urban markets, according to a recent analysis by a health policy research group.\nColorado Health OP, the state\u2019s consumer co-op, is fairly competitive in Denver but less so in Grand Junction, the Urban Institute said."}
