Mr. Regan is correct, however, at the end of his piece when the focus shifts to the U.S. Supreme Court's interpretation of the Medicaid expansion group found in National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius, 132 S.Ct. 2566 (2012). As most are aware, and as stated in NFIB, the Supreme Court is responsible for enforcing the limits on federal power by striking down acts of Congress that transgress those limits. See NFIB, 132 S.Ct. at 2579-80.
