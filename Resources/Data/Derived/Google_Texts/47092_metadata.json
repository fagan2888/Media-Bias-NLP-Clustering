Credit: Associated Press\n\nBy of the\n\nBipartisan legislation that supporters say would improve access to care for America's most troubled foster children has been introduced by Sens. Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.) and Rob Portman (R-Ohio).\n\nThe bill \u2014 the Quality Foster Care Services Act \u2014 seeks to clarify Medicaid policy for foster children with serious medical, psychological, emotional and social needs, Baldwin said in a news release Thursday.\n\nIn Wisconsin, these children are generally placed in treatment foster care, where parents have been given specialized training and children receive intensive in-home services so they can remain in the community and avoid being institutionalized.\n\nApproximately 1,000 children in Wisconsin and 40,000 children across the country receive treatment foster care, also known as therapeutic foster care.\n\nExisting law does not provide a definition for treatment foster care under Medicaid, a problem, Baldwin says, that impairs quality and access.\n\nThe proposed bill would establish a standardized federal definition.\n\nBipartisan companion legislation is being introduced in the House by Representatives by Reps. Rosa DeLauro (D-Conn.) and Rep. Tom Cole (R-Okla.).\n\nWisconsin officials on Wednesday announced their own plan to provide better access to health care for children in foster care, named Care4Kids.\n\nThe program provides a primary care provider and a team of specialists charged with providing each child with comprehensive and coordinated services, including physical, mental and oral health care.", "article_metadata": {"title": "Tammy Baldwin introduces bill to boost health care for foster children", "og": {"url": "http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/tammy-baldwin-introduces-bill-to-boost-health-care-for-foster-children-b99199895z1-244020771.html", "image": {"width": 2048, "identifier": "http://media.jrn.com/images/b99199895z.1_20140206230550_000_g0l4nf8i.1-1.jpg", "height": 1285}, "type": "article", "description": "Supporters say the legislation would improve access to care for America\u2019s most troubled foster children.", "title": "Baldwin introduces bill to boost care for foster children"}, "twitter": {"site": "@journalsentinel", "image": "http://media.jrn.com/images/b99199895z.1_20140206230550_000_g0l4nf8i.1-1.jpg", "description": "Supporters say the legislation would improve access to care for America\u2019s most troubled foster children.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Tammy Baldwin introduces bill to boost health care for foster children"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "fb": {"admins": "journal.sentinel.1", "app_id": 227386193957280}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://media.jrn.com/designimages/logo-mjs-144-icon.png", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd153\"", "article_summary": "Approximately 1,000 children in Wisconsin and 40,000 children across the country receive treatment foster care, also known as therapeutic foster care.\nSen.
