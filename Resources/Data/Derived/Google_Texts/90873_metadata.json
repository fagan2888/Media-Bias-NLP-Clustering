The Hang Seng Index had plummeted 5.2% on Monday, bringing the market to its weakest point, by one measure, since the crash of 1987, but within an hour of opening on Tuesday it had soared more than 700 points. By the midday break, things had cooled but were still looking up, bringing a cautious optimism to an anxious trading floor.\n\n\u201cI made some money this morning,\u201d Kwan said outside the doors to One Exchange Square in Hong Kong\u2019s Central district. \u201cI lost a lot of money yesterday, and last week, but I\u2019ve made some back today. We\u2019ll see.\u201d\n\nBut by 3 p.m., the Hang Seng Index \u2014 the standard barometer of Hong Kong\u2019s market performance \u2014 went south again, falling nearly 500 points, or down 1.04% from the opening bell. A sudden spurt of second wind at the end of the day pulled the index ahead, allowing it to close around three-quarters of a percentage point up, but traders left the floor on Tuesday afternoon looking somewhat dazed, blinking as they stepped into the smoggy sunlight.\n\nHong Kong is not alone in its volatility. The ongoing stock sell-off in mainland China has flamed panic in markets across the world. \u201cBlack Monday,\u201d as the Chinese state media (in a rare moment of honest self-appraisal) called yesterday\u2019s rout, encouraged the biggest sell-off in U.S. and European markets since 2011. As things got worse on Tuesday \u2014 by close, the indices in Shanghai and Shenzhen had fallen 7.6% and 7.1%, respectively \u2014 the rest of Asia followed suit, with India\u2019s Sensex and the Nikkei in Japan both taking a tumble immediately after lunch.\n\nHowever, while the markets of New York City and Tokyo are liable to recover, some experts worry that Hong Kong could be along for China\u2019s downward ride. The political turmoil in this island city last autumn demonstrated that many Hong Kongers hold themselves proudly detached from the political and cultural influence of mainland China, but the ties between them, at least in economic terms, may be too tight to ignore.\n\n\u201cThe closeness of Hong Kong market means that it moves more or less with the Chinese market,\u201d Bernard Aw, a market analyst with IG Group in Singapore, tells TIME. \u201cIf you look at the Hang Seng market, 20% of it is Chinese companies incorporated in China that are listed in Hong Kong.\u201d\n\nIn recent years, Aw says, China has used Hong Kong as a pawn in its efforts to open the country\u2019s markets to foreign investment. Investing in Hong Kong, a bastion of free-market capitalism on the southern cusp of this self-proclaimed communist country, is easy, and therefore Chinese companies listed on the Hong Kong markets \u2014 comprising half of the overall market here \u2014 can avail themselves of foreign money. The Shanghai and Shenzhen markets draw domestic investment; Hong Kong bolsters that with investments from overseas.\n\nIn short, Hong Kong\u2019s stock markets have subjected themselves to the dual currents of Chinese and global market trends. The apogee of its surge earlier this year \u2014 reaching its highest value since January 2008 \u2014 echoed the bullish run of China\u2019s markets, which were also booming. Since June, when investors began to realize that the Chinese bubble was just that, Hong Kong\u2019s markets have suffered accordingly.\n\n\u201cIf we\u2019re looking at a farther horizon \u2014 12 to 24 months \u2014 there\u2019s a chance for both markets to recover,\u201d Aw says. \u201cBut in the near term, I see the trend heading south.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Experts worry that Hong Kong's close economic links to China mean it is in for a rough ride", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "TIME.com", "description": "The city's economic links to China could mean it is in for a rough ride.", "title": "Hong Kong Bourse Fitfully Recovers but Nerves Remain", "url": "http://time.com/4009410/hong-kong-china-stock-market-economy/", "image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/gettyimages-483704246.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1012", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/gettyimages-483704246.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1012"}, "description": "The city's economic links to China could mean it is in for a rough ride.", "site": "TIME", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Hong Kong Bourse Fitfully Recovers but Nerves Remain"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-tooltip": "Current & Breaking News | National & World Updates", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://time.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/2cee445ea71a179ffd35ea91cf154905?s=16", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "fb": {"app_id": 53177223193}, "p": {"domain_verify": "f48a8936c3fffc943fce516f2e3ff1d2"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/time2014/img/time-touch_icon_152.png", "application-name": "TIME", "keywords": "china, hong kong, stock markets, hang seng index, beijing, shanghai", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/time"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "china, hong kong, stock markets, hang seng index, beijing, shanghai"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0914\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThe closeness of Hong Kong market means that it moves more or less with the Chinese market,\u201d Bernard Aw, a market analyst with IG Group in Singapore, tells TIME.\n+ READ ARTICLETomy Kwan, a 44-year-old trader at the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, came back from lunch on Tuesday happy, or at least calmer than he had been.\nIn short, Hong Kong\u2019s stock markets have subjected themselves to the dual currents of Chinese and global market trends.\nSince June, when investors began to realize that the Chinese bubble was just that, Hong Kong\u2019s markets have suffered accordingly.\n\u201cI made some money this morning,\u201d Kwan said outside the doors to One Exchange Square in Hong Kong\u2019s Central district."}
