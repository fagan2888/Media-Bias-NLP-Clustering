The law allows for \u201cshort coverage gaps\u201d of up to three months before imposing the penalty, which is $95 or 1% of an individual\u2019s income (whichever is greater) next year. Under the current rules, someone would have to be covered by March 31, an official with the Department of Health and Human Services confirmed, which is the final day that people will be able to purchase health insurance on the public exchanges, or marketplaces, created by the ACA.\n\nReuters An Affordable Care Act outreach event in Los Angeles on Sept. 28, 2013.\n\nBut the Administration is currently working to revise its policy to ensure that people who wait till the last day in March to sign up will not face a penalty, the HHS official clarified. That means that people may go uninsured till April or May without paying a fine, as it takes up to two weeks to process health insurance applications, and new health policies take effect on the first day of each month. A last-minute March 31 application, for example, might be processed by mid-April for coverage starting May 1.\n\nAs the law stands now, in order to be covered by March 31, people would actually need to have insurance by March 1. And since it takes up to two weeks to process insurance applications, consumers would have to apply by Feb. 15, the Associated Press reported recently. (People must apply by Dec. 15 if they want coverage starting Jan. 1.)\n\nThe Administration, however, has recognized that there\u2019s a \u201cdisconnect\u201d between the actual and effective deadlines, as the deadline to get health insurance in time to comply with the ACA is currently six weeks earlier than the final deadline to buy it. Now, the Administration is working to make sure the two deadlines line up with each other, says the HHS official. An announcement about when it will enforce the penalty for being uninsured, and whether that penalty will be delayed beyond the de facto March 31 deadline, will come shortly. The insurance requirement still kicks in Jan. 1, and the enrollment period will close March 31 as planned, the official adds.\n\nWhat if Obamacare works?

The Obama administration has so far resisted GOP pleas to delay the requirement that individuals purchase insurance next year, but has lately expressed frustration with the technical difficulties. Those problems, perhaps the elephant in the room during deadline discussions, may influence a decision to provide an enrollment grace period to avoid fines.\n\nThere is another sign that the penalty policy may be in flux: While HHS referred MarketWatch\u2019s previous inquiries about the fine, and the deadline to avoid it, to the Treasury, a spokesperson there referred a request Wednesday back to HHS, suggesting that the health officials are now the ones writing new rules for the law.\n\nAlso see: The freelancer\u2019s guide to Obamacare\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that the open enrollment period has already been extended to a full six months this year for the implementation of the ACA: In future years, people will have a few months in the fall to enroll in health insurance starting the following January.\n\nMore from MarketWatch", "article_metadata": {"lifp_basePath": "https://id.marketwatch.com/access", "twitter": {"domain": "marketwatch.com", "description": "The Obama administration will give Americans extra time to sign up for health insurance under the Affordable Care Act, postponing when penalties for failing to buy coverage will go into effect.", "image": {"width": 569, "identifier": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-BM158_obamac_MG_20130930141256.jpg", "height": 398}, "card": "summary_large_image", "site": {"id": 624413}}, "parsely-author": "Jen Wieczner", "article.content_group": "marketwatch", "article.section": "Personal Finance", "parsely-type": "post", "description": "The Obama administration will give Americans extra time to sign up for health insurance under the Affordable Care Act, postponing when penalties for failing to buy coverage will go into effect.", "parsely-link": "http://www.marketwatch.com/story/obamacare-mandate-may-be-delayed-2013-10-23", "author": "Jen Wieczner", "parsely-title": "Obamacare penalties to be delayed", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=336693422", "parsely-pub-date": "2013-10-24T12:06:00-04:00", "page.site": "marketwatch", "robots": "noarchive,noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 283204329838}, "parsely-section": "MW_Personal Finance", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/marketwatch"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "og": {"site_name": "MarketWatch", "description": "The Obama administration will give Americans extra time to sign up for health insurance under the Affordable Care Act, postponing when penalties for failing to buy coverage will go into effect.", "title": "Obamacare penalties to be delayed", "url": "http://www.marketwatch.com/story/obamacare-mandate-may-be-delayed-2013-10-23", "image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-BM158_obamac_MG_20130930141256.jpg", "type": "article"}, "ob": {"image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-BM158_obamac_MG_20130930141256.jpg"}, "article.id": "A4521E98-3C1D-11E3-9EF8-00212803FAD6", "position": 1}, "article_summary": "An announcement about when it will enforce the penalty for being uninsured, and whether that penalty will be delayed beyond the de facto March 31 deadline, will come shortly.\nNow, the Administration is working to make sure the two deadlines line up with each other, says the HHS official.\nThe insurance requirement still kicks in Jan. 1, and the enrollment period will close March 31 as planned, the official adds.\nAs the law stands now, in order to be covered by March 31, people would actually need to have insurance by March 1.\nThe Obama administration will delay enforcement of the Affordable Care Act\u2019s health insurance mandate, extending how long Americans may go uninsured before facing a penalty under the law, MarketWatch has learned."}
