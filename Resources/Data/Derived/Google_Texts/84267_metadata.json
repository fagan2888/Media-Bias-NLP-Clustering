Cory Gardner\u2019s soon-to-be vacant congressional seat is growing, with two more candidates announcing Monday they\u2019re in.\n\nWeld County Commissioner Barbara Kirkmeyer and Larimer County resident Steve Laffey join state Sen. Scott Renfoe and District Attorney Ken Buck, both of Weld County, who announced last week they\u2019re seeking the GOP nomination in the 4th. State Reps. Frank McNulty of Highlands Ranch and Tim Dore of Elizabeth also are looking at the race.\n\nGardner upended Colorado\u2019s political landscape last week when he announced he was dropping his re-election bid and running for the U.S. Senate, a race last year he declined to pursue. Two Senate front-runners, Buck and state Rep. Amy Stephens, dropped their Senate bids and instead backed Gardner.\n\nThe winner of the June 24 primary faces Democrat Vic Meyers of Trinidad.\n\n\u201cI got into this race because we the people of the 4th CD weren\u2019t being represented in Congress. Gardner dropping out doesn\u2019t change anything,\u201d Meyers said. \u201cReplacing him with another Tea Party radical doesn\u2019t change anything and won\u2019t get us representation.\u201d\n\nBut he faces a tough fight, as the 4th District, which includes the eastern plains and a portion of Douglas County, is overwhelmingly Republican.\n\nKirkmeyer\u2019s decision came after fellow Weld County Commissioner Sean Conway decided not to run for Gardner\u2019s seat. Kirkmayer praised the work done by Weld County.\n\n\u201cWe are the only county in the state to have no long-term debt, no short-term debt, no county sales tax, give a TABOR refund by reducing the mill levy \u2026 year after year and we have close to $100 million in contingency reserves,\u201d she said in an e-mail. \u201cI want to take the Weld County model to Washington.\u201d\n\nLaffey, who briefly was in Colorado\u2019s governor\u2019s race, said in a news release he is running to \u201cpreserve a dying American dream and American freedoms.\u201d\n\nLaffey lives outside of the 4th Congressional District because his ranch was cut out during the redistricting in 2011, but he said that he, his wife and six kids \u201clive only about three miles as the crow flies from the 4th district line.\u201d And he said he share\u2019s the 4th District\u2019s values of maintaining water rights, property rights and small government.\n\nMcNulty also lives outside the 4th, in the 6th Congressional District represented by Republican Mike Coffman.\n\nBut there is no constitutional requirement to live in the district to run for Congress. Republican Lang Sias of Arvada lived just outside the 7th District when he ran in 2010 to try to unseat Democratic Congressman Ed Perlmutter of Golden.\n\nStaff writers Lynn Bartels and Kurtis Lee contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Barbara Kirkmeyer,Cory Gardner,Frank McNulty,Ken Buck,Sean Conway,Steve Laffey,Tim Dore", "language": "en, sv", "og": {"site_name": "The Spot", "description": "Two more Republicans join the 4th Congressional District primary after Rep.
