Lowe\u2019s was a major anchor in the shopping center, which sits just off state Route 78 at San Marcos Boulevard.\n\nThe city brought in $3.4 million in rent revenues from the complex last year, and the lease agreements with Hobby Lobby and WinCo are set to bump that up to $5.3 million. The combined rent paid by the two stores will be more than double the $834,000 that Lowe\u2019s paid each year.\n\nCity Spokeswoman Sarah Macdonald said that\u2019s due to a number of factors, including improved real estate market conditions since the Lowe\u2019s lease was negotiated a dozen or so years ago.\n\nAdded to that, when the complex opened in 2004, the city owned the land, but Lowe\u2019s owned the building. After Lowe\u2019s moved out in 2013, San Marcos bought the large structure for roughly $4.5 million.\n\nBeing in the landlord business gives the city an additional revenue stream to pay for city services and operations.\n\n\u201cCreekside Marketplace is a testament to the\u2026 entrepreneurial spirit that makes the city unique,\u201d Macdonald said.\n\nThe San Marcos unveilings come as both national chains are growing.\n\nLast year, the privately held, family-owned Hobby Lobby opened 68 craft and home stores, and hopes to open 70 new stores this year, company spokesman Zack Higbee said last week. That\u2019s more than twice the number of stores Hobby Lobby opened in the prior four years, from 2010 through 2013.\n\nIn all, the company has 666 stores, including 31 in California. The roughly 60,000-square-foot North County location is Hobby Lobby\u2019s second store in the county; the first opened a La Mesa site in May. Higbee said the company also plans to open in Chula Vista, and is looking at other sites in the county.\n\nHobby Lobby typically sets up in existing spaces close to retail cores, Higbee said. The old Lowe\u2019s site, he said, \u201callowed us to be in a large center that was well-located in the market.\u201d\n\nThe Oklahoma-based company, owned by a Christian family, made headlines after it sued over an Affordable Care Act requirement that employers cover contraceptives for women. In June 2014, the Supreme Court sided with the company, finding that small, privately held corporations can hold religious objections under federal law.\n\nHobby Lobby employs more than 15,000 people nationwide, and its stores are closed on Sundays. Individual outlets generally hire between 30 to 50 employees, from cashiers to custom framers. Higbee declined to say roughly how many workers have full-time status, but said full time workers start at $15.24 an hour. Part-timers get $10.26 an hour.\n\nAt the still-under-reconstruction WinCo Foods next door, the company is looking to hire roughly 130 employees. WinCo is an employee-owned company, and workers who qualify are eligible for stock options after one year of employment. (Applications can be found at wincofoods.com.)\n\nAt WinCo \u2014 founded in 1967 under the name \u201cWaremart\u201d \u2014 customers bag their own purchases. The store doesn\u2019t take credit cards (debit cards are fine) and the chain generally doesn\u2019t do mass advertising or weekly circulars. Most stores are open 24 hours a day.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The first WinCo discount grocery store in San Diego County is set to open in October in the San Marcos Creekside Marketplace, next to a Hobby Lobby \u2014 the second in the county \u2014 that began serving customers last month.
