(AP) \u2014 Long before the state turned solidly red, Asa Hutchinson was the face of the Republican Party in Arkansas. Born in the arch-conservative hometown of Wal-Mart, the mild-mannered attorney made a bold effort to unseat a Democratic political giant, Sen. Dale Bumpers, and later as a congressman even prosecuted the impeachment case against native son President Bill Clinton.\n\nWhen he ran for governor in 2014, Hutchinson predictably echoed the party\u2019s attacks on President Barack Obama and on Obama\u2019s health care law, which he called for repealing.\n\nBut two years after winning office with 55 percent of the vote, Hutchinson has executed a surprising political turnabout and become the leading rescuer of the one of \u201cObamacare\u2019s\u201d most embattled elements, the expansion of Medicaid.\n\nHe\u2019s now imploring Republican lawmakers to keep Arkansas\u2019 hybrid version of the expanded insurance program for low-income people, which was pushed through by his Democratic predecessor, Mike Beebe, and is warning about the potential impact of ending it for a rural state with limited revenue and many living near the poverty line.\n\n\u201cI did not want to punish Arkansas simply to make a political point,\u201d Hutchinson told The Associated Press as the Legislature prepares to return to session next month to take up Medicaid\u2019s future.\n\nHutchinson\u2019s position, which has inflamed some in his party, shows the difficulty of juggling the politics and practical aspects of a controversial health care law that means billions of dollars in federal money for states. About a third of the states_most controlled by Republicans\u2014 have rejected expanding Medicaid, calling it an excessive government overreach. The handful of Republican governors who have backed expansion were mostly more moderate and in states that Obama carried, such as Michigan and Ohio.\n\nBut Hutchinson is no moderate. He has led the charge in Arkansas for deep tax cuts and tough anti-abortion legislation. Those watching his temperate stand on the health plan wonder if it foretells a possible softening of opposition in conservative states when more people get coverage.\n\n\u201cIt would hurt Arkansas to say we\u2019re going to allow Washington to take all this money out of the state,\u201d he said, considering it would end \u201chealth care coverage for the 200,000 plus that\u2019s on that Medicaid expansion.\u201d\n\nArkansas is expected to get more than $1.6 billion in federal funds next year for Medicaid recipients. The federal government covered 100 percent of the expansion\u2019s costs, with its share gradually declining to 90 percent in 2020. Since the enrollment was expanded in 2013, the proportion of Arkansans without insurance has dropped from 22 to 9.6 percent.\n\nHutchinson, 65, makes the case for covering additional people in his typically understated fashion. Lanky and soft-spoken, he sounds more like an attorney calmly persuading a jury in a trial, and he often relies on charts and graphs in his speeches.\n\nFew of his Republican colleagues in the statehouse will criticize him directly, but many are determined to beat him on the issue.\n\n\u201cI think he\u2019s trying to have it both ways\u201d on Obamacare, said Republican Rep. Donnie Copeland, who regularly criticized the Medicaid expansion in his last campaign. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t make him a bad guy. That just makes him wrong.\u201d\n\nRepublican Senate opponent Bart Hester said he believes there are enough votes in the 35-member Senate to block Hutchinson\u2019s plan, which requires three-quarters approval in both the Legislature\u2019s GOP-controlled chambers.\n\n\u201cThis guy has been fighting for conservative principles since before I was born. He\u2019s earned the right to disagree a little bit,\u201d Hester said.\n\nArkansas\u2019 hybrid expansion of Medicaid, which passed in 2013, uses federal funds to purchase private insurance for low-income residents. During his gubernatorial campaign, Hutchinson ducked saying what he\u2019d do with the program.\n\nAfter his election, and after a task force studied the options, Hutchinson called for keeping the expanded coverage with new restrictions such as charging premiums to some recipients.\n\nMany recipients are now waiting in suspense for the Legislature\u2019s decision. Lauren Coopwood, a chiropractic assistant from Marion, enrolled about a year ago after Medicaid expanded its rolls. Coopwood, 28, said she doesn\u2019t know what she and her husband, a full-time student at the University of Memphis, would do if the program ends.\n\n\u201cThen what?\u201d said Coopwood, a Republican who said she voted for Hutchinson two years ago, adding, \u201cwe can\u2019t afford another private (plan). We really have just been quiet about it right now and hoping for the best, I guess.\u201d\n\nDemocrats are gleefully pointing out Hutchinson\u2019s problems within his own party.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got to say, I\u2019ve never seen somebody embrace a program and run away from it at the same time,\u201d Senate Minority Leader Keith Ingram, a Democrat from West Memphis, said last month.\n\nHutchinson\u2019s Democratic predecessor said expanded Medicaid makes the most sense financially for Arkansas, even for those who disagree with the Obama health plan as national policy.\n\n\u201cWe said the same thing\u201d in 2013, Beebe said. \u201cWe said if you want to fight Obamacare, go to Washington.\u201d\n\n___\n\nFollow Andrew DeMillo on Twitter at www.twitter.com/ademillo", "article_metadata": {"description": "LITTLE ROCK, Ark.
