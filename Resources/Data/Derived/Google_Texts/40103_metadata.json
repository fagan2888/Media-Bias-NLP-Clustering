If auto insurers were mandated to subsidize higher bad-driver premiums with lower good-driver premiums, and the penalties for not carrying insurance were negligible, good drivers would see insurance as a bad deal and would begin leaving the market. Eventually, only the bad drivers would be left, and the premiums would be so high that the car insurance market would collapse.\n\nNow think of selling health insurance. The worst cases mean paying hundreds of thousands per patient for expensive drugs for multiple chronic illnesses and repeated hospital admissions and specialist consultations every year. In health care, the difference between a \u201csafe driver\u201d (i.e., a consumer who might spend a few hundred dollars a year on medical care) and a \u201crisky driver\u201d (i.e., a very sick consumer) is far greater in terms of costs. For every 100 health insurance customers, the rule of thumb is that just one of them will account for 30 percent of all costs, and that just five of them will account for 50 percent of all costs.\n\nAs an insurer, you don\u2019t know how sick your customers could end up, and you\u2019re on the hook if you get it wrong. Worse, with the ACA\u2019s state insurance exchanges, you\u2019re limited to pricing the riskier, sicker older customers at no more than three times the least-sick customers. That makes it a bargain for the sick and a bad deal for the young healthy customers. While the penalty for not having health insurance is the maximum of either $695 or 2.5 percent of family income, that\u2019s a lot less than the cost of health insurance.\n\nIf an insurer gets its pricing wrong, it will make a loss and be forced to exit the business or increase premiums. But if you raise prices, those customers who don\u2019t value your services as much as others will drop out. And who will be left? The sicker customers who know they\u2019re going to get a better deal by staying insured with you.\n\nBut to make a profit, you also need those healthier folks onboard, contributing premiums but using fewer medical services. Without them you\u2019ll make more of a loss, or you\u2019ll fall victim to the death spiral of rising premiums, declining customers and higher costs. This isn\u2019t theoretical; a generous Harvard health plan experienced such a classical death spiral some time ago.\n\nAlso, the same way a death spiral can occur within a health insurance company, it can also occur among a bunch of health insurance firms operating on the ACA\u2019s insurance exchanges, like Covered California. If individual firms make a loss on their business or fail to make enough profit, they will withdraw from the insurance exchange. Their previous customers would seek insurance from the remaining participants, who can\u2019t decline them. This would reduce the other firms\u2019 profits and potentially prompt them to leave, too.\n\nCould such a uber-death spiral occur in the insurance exchanges? Chances are yes, despite ACA design features to share losses. We know United Healthcare lost $2 million a day on that business in 2015; Highmark, $1 million a day; and Aetna lost 3 percent to 4 percent on each dollar of ACA business. Blue Cross and Blue Shield of North Carolina may lose more than $400 million on its Obamacare business and is sharply limiting ACA enrollment.\n\nWhat can be done? On one extreme, a Medicare-for-all approach such as Sen. Bernie Sanders\u2019 proposal dispenses with insurance completely. A more realistic market-based alternative would remove the mandate to purchase insurance and provide credits to poor, high-risk customers. Still other policies could include increasing competition by allowing insurers to sell across state boundaries, or better meeting customers needs by changing plan benefits and making them more affordable.\n\nIn an industry as important as health care, we need good, stable trajectories. But with the relentless partisan fights over Obamacare, don\u2019t count on Republicans helping to prevent these ACA death spirals from speeding up.\n\nJoel Hay is professor at USC School of Pharmacy.
